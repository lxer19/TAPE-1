Title: On the Testability of Causal Models with Latent and Instrumental Variables  
Author: Judea Pearl 
Keyword: Key words: causal modeling, instrumental variables, structural models, graphical models.

Abstract: Certain causal models involving unmeasured variables induce no independence constraints among the observed variables but imply, nevertheless, inequality constraints on the observed distribution. This paper derives a general formula for such inequality constraints as induced by instrumental variables, that is, exogenous variables that directly affect some variables but not all. With the help of this formula, it is possible to test whether a model involving instrumental variables may account for the data, or, conversely, whether a given vari able can be deemed instrumental.

Reference-contexts: Such an assumption amounts to having no contrarians in the population, namely, no individual who would consistently act contrary to his or her assignment. Under this assumption, which Im-bens and Angrist [1994] call monotonicity, the inequalities in Eq. (3) can be tightened <ref> [Balke & Pearl 1994a] </ref> to give P (y; X = 1jZ = 1) P (y; X = 1jZ = 0) for all y 2 f0; 1g.

Reference-contexts: Economists and social scientists have frequently remarked upon the difficulty of knowing or demonstrating that a variable Z is instrumental, in the sense of being uncorrelated with the disturbance U <ref> [Bartels 1991] </ref>. Imbens and Angrist [1994], for example, explicitly state that the model in Eq. (1) is not testable even when Z is randomized.

Reference-contexts: When all variables in a causal model are observable, conditional independence relationships are sufficient indeed for capturing all the constraints that the model imposes on the joint distribution <ref> [Verma & Pearl 1991] </ref>. This is not the case when the model invokes unobserved variables, also called hidden or latent variables.
