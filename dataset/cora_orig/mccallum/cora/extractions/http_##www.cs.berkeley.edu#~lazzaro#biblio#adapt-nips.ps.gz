Reference-contexts: Among other limitations, this circuit does not model the short-term temporal adaptation of the auditory nerve. Many auditory theorists consider the temporal adaptation of the auditory nerve a key aspect of speech coding in the auditory periphery <ref> (Delgutte and Kiang, 1984) </ref>. From the engineering perspective, the pitch perception and auditory localization chips perform well with sustained sounds as input; temporal adaptation in the silicon auditory nerve should improve performance for transient sounds.

Reference-contexts: Each curve is marked with the amplitude of presented tone burst, in dB. Tone burst frequency is 1Khz. 4. DATA ANALYSIS The experiment shown in Figure 1 (a) was repeated for tone bursts of different amplitudes; this data set was used to produce several standard measures of adaptive response <ref> (Hewitt and Meddis, 1991) </ref>. The integrated auditory nerve circuit was used for this set of experiments.

Reference-contexts: If this tone burst in repeated at 80ms intervals, each response in unique; by averaging the responses to 64 consecutive tone bursts (bottom trace), we see the envelope of the temporal adaptation superimposed on the cycle-by-cycle phase-locking of the spike train. These behaviors qualitatively match biological experiments <ref> (Kiang et al., 1965) </ref>. In biological auditory nerve fibers, cycle-by-cycle phase locking ceases for auditory fibers tuned to sufficiently high frequencies, but the temporal adaptation property remains. In the silicon spiral ganglion neuron, a 10kHz pure tone burst fails to elicit phase-locking (Figure 1 (b), trace identities as in (a)). <p> In the silicon spiral ganglion neuron, a 10kHz pure tone burst fails to elicit phase-locking (Figure 1 (b), trace identities as in (a)). Temporal adaptation remains, however, qualitatively matching biological experiments <ref> (Kiang et al., 1965) </ref>. To compare this data with the previous generation of silicon auditory nerve circuits, we set the control parameters of the new spiral ganglion model to eliminate temporal adaptation. Figure 1 (c) shows the 1 kHz tone burst response (trace identities as in (a)).

Reference-contexts: The silicon model of auditory nerve response models sensory transduction and spike generation in the auditory periphery at a high level of abstraction <ref> (Lazzaro and Mead, 1989c) </ref>; this circuit is a component in silicon models of auditory localization, pitch perception, and spectral shape enhancement (Lazzaro and Mead, 1989ab; Lazzaro, 1991a). Among other limitations, this circuit does not model the short-term temporal adaptation of the auditory nerve. <p> Phase locking occurs without temporal adaptation. The uneven response of the averaged spike outputs is due to beat frequencies between the input tone frequency and the output spike rate; in practice, the circuit noise of the silicon cochleas adds random variation to the auditory input and smooths this response <ref> (Lazzaro and Mead, 1989c) </ref>. (a) (c) for all plots, all horizontal rules measure 5 ms. (a) Chip response to a 1 kHz, 20 ms tone burst. <p> Trace identifications identical to (a). Response shows temporal adaptation without phase locking. (c) Chip response to a 1 kHz, 20 ms tone burst, with adaptation circuitry disabled. Trace identifications identical to (a). Response shows phase locking without temporal adaptation. 3. CIRCUIT DESIGN transduction remain unchanged from the original model <ref> (Lazzaro and Mead, 1989c) </ref>, and are shown as a single box. This box performs time differentiation, nonlinear compression and half-wave rectification on the input waveform V i , producing a unidirectional current waveform as output. The dependent current source represents this processed signal.

Reference-contexts: Tone burst frequency is 1Khz. after full adaptation; at these moderate intensities, however, the onset instantaneous spike rate continues to encode intensity. Figure 4 shows a non-monotonicity at high intensities in the onset response; this undesired non-monotonicity is a result of the undesired saturation of the silicon cochlea circuit <ref> (Lazzaro, 1991b) </ref>. 5. CONCLUSION This circuit improves the silicon model of auditory response, by adding temporal adaptation. We expect this improvement to enhance existing architectures for auditory localization and pitch perception, and aid the creation of new circuits for speech processing. Acknowledgements Thanks to K.

Reference-contexts: In this way, temporal adaptation occurs, with characteristics determined by V p and V l . The nonlinear differential equations for this adaptation circuit are similar to the equations governing the adaptive baroreceptor circuit <ref> (Lazzaro et al., 1991) </ref>; the publication describing this circuit includes an analysis deriving a recurrence relation that describes the pulse output of the circuit given a step input. 0.0 10 20 30 200 600 16 36 26 Sp/sec tone burst begins at 0 ms.

The dependent current source represents this processed signal. The axon hillock circuit <ref> (Mead, 1989) </ref>, drawn as a box marked with a pulse, converts this current signal into a series of fixed-width, fixed height spikes; V o is the output of the model.
