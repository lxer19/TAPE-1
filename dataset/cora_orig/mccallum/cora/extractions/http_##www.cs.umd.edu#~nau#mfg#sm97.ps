Abstract: This paper presents our initial efforts to develop a systematic approach for assessing the similarity of solid models based on how they will be manufactured. The goal of this work is to develop methods that, given a solid model representing the design of a new product, query a product information database (of solid models, associated manufacturing plans, and related attributes) and identify existing designs with manufacturing plans similar to some reasonable plan for the new designor useful as a starting point for creation of a new plan for the new design. Our approach is based on the automatic generation (from CAD models) of graph structures that contain manufacturing information (in the form of manufacturing features). We are developing ways to measure similarity among these graph structures, so that given the graph structures corresponding to two different designs, we can tell how similar or different they are. The similarity measure will be used as a basis for indexing and retrieving similar designs from databases. An implementation of our approach is discussed. We believe our work is a first step in producing computer-generatable and computer-interpretable similarity assessment techniques that will be useful for applications such as vari

Reference-contexts: To make the idea more concrete and show how it might be useful in practical domains, we now describe a specific instantiation of this approach, in a prototype system for classifying machined parts for use in process planning. For a more detailed description, see <ref> [1] </ref>. 4.1 Manufacturing Features There have been several attempts to arrive at precise definitions for manufacturing features. Most have involved the use 1 Although our graphs have labels on the edges and nodes, graph iso-morphism is nearly the same as for ordinary unlabeled graphs.

Reference-contexts: To decide whether an intersection is critical, we use several criteria based upon manufacturing heuristics from <ref> [3, 18] </ref>. Here are simplified versions of some of our criteria: * Any volumetric intersection between two milling features is non-critical.

Reference-contexts: This swept volume can be divided into two parts: the removal volume, which is the volume of material that is to be removed by the machining operation; and the accessibility volume, which is the non-cutting portion of the tool-swept volume <ref> [4, 12] </ref>. The machining features described below represent the removal volume and the approach direction. A feature type is a parameterized volumetric template M that represents the removal volume of a particular type of machining operation. <p> A primary machining feature is one that contains as much of the stock as possible without intersecting with the part, and as little space as possible outside the stock; our reasons for using primary features are discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>. In general, there may be several alternative interpretations of the part as different collections of machining features, each interpretation corresponding to a different way of manufacturing it. A feature-based model is a set of feature instances that models a single, unique interpretation of the part.

Reference-contexts: In each case the basic idea is to capture critical design and manufacturing attributes of a part in an alphanumeric string, or GT code, that is assigned to that part. The typical GT code <ref> [6] </ref> consists of two types of positions. In one case, a position describes some global property of the design such as material, size, type, functionality, etc., and its meaning is completely independent of what values are stored elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: At first glance, this might seem prohibitively expensive, since the best known algorithm for checking graph isomorphism takes exponential time in the worst case. However, in our experiments our approach generally performed quite well, for the reasons described below: 1. The general approach for checking isomorphism is quite simple <ref> [7] </ref>: compare parameters describing graphs as a whole (number of nodes and edges, average degree of the node, etc.), then partition all nodes of each graph into groups so that any possible mapping between graph vertices will map all nodes of any group into all nodes of the corresponding group, and

Reference-contexts: However, the approach suffers from two drawbacks. First, the CSG representation for a design is not unique and a robust method for computing a unique CSG representation for a design has not yet been found (many believe that such a method simply cannot be found <ref> [8] </ref>). Second, the CSG primitives that would be involved in such a representation do not necessarily correspond to the manufacturing operations that would be used to manufacture the designand thus the classification might not be very useful for manufacturing practice.

Reference-contexts: The basic ideato make parts of similar shape on specially grouped machines [2]and the consequent need for some way of classifying designs according to their manufacturing requirementsis an old technique, and some references to it can be found as early as 1925. However, only after the works of Mitrofanov <ref> [9] </ref> and Opitz [10] did it become very popular. In the last 35 years, many classification schemes have been developed, with emphasis in the different areas of design and manufacturing.
