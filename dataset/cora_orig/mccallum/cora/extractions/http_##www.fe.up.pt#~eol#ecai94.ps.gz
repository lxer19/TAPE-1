Abstract: The ability to respond sensibly to changing and conflicting beliefs is an integral part of intelligent agency. To this end, we outline the design and implementation of a Distributed Assumption based Truth Maintenance System (DATMS) appropriate for controlling cooperative problem solving in a dynamic real world multi-agent community. Our DATMS works on the principle of local coherence which means that different agents can have different perspectives on the same fact provided that these stances are appropriately justified. The belief revision algorithm is presented, the metalevel control actions needed to ensure that all systemwide queries can be uniquely answered is described, and the DATMS' implementation in a general purpose multi-agent shell is discussed. only be used when there is supporting local evidence?, how should contradictions between the beliefs of different agents be dealt with?, and so on. It is in the discussion and resolution of these issues (section 2), and their subsequent implementation (section 3), that the main contribution of this work lies. 2.1 Asocial Belief Revision In many AI applications problem solving entities often have to make decisions based on partial, imprecise, and ever changing information. However in systems in which several agents cooperate with one another within a decentralised control regime, the information management problem is exacerbated still further - each agent has to contend with deficiencies and changes in the information supplied by its contemporaries as well as in its own local information. In a TMS "belief" is taken to mean justified belief - either it is an assumption or it has been deduced from other beliefs. While an assumed fact is believed, an ordinary fact may be believed or unbelieved; and a contradiction is always false. There are a number of different ways in which the dependencies between beliefs can be registered: in justification based TMSs (JTMSs) each belief is associated with the beliefs that immediately caused it [Doyle, 1979]; whereas in an assumption based TMS (ATMS) each belief is associated with the smallest set of environments from which it can be deduced ( the belief's label) [de Kleer, 1986a]. This work concentrates on the ATMS approach because, when compared with the JTMS, it: To keep track of an agent's changing beliefs, researchers have devised a number of different types of Truth Maintenance System (TMS) [Martins, 1990]. Such systems portray as their main features the maintenance of the coherence between their beliefs, the reason for their beliefs and the identification of contradictions. Whilst these systems are generally sufficient for maintaining beliefs in an asocial context, they need to be extended if they are to be used in a social context. For example, as well as beliefs that an individual has generated for itself, there will be beliefs that it has been informed about by other community members (either because an acquaintance has answered a query or because it has volunteered a piece of relevant information). In such cases a number of crucial decisions must be made about how the information provided by other agents should be treated - should it be given the same credence as locally deduced beliefs?, should it enhances the system's efficiency and improves its real time operation because multiple contexts are kept. This makes it faster to move from one valid context to another because the new one does not have to be calculated from scratch. improves the system's transparency because the belief revision is not contingent on dependency oriented backtracking and hence it will not stop on unresolved circularities or leave nodes unlabeled. ATMSs are composed of three units: (i) the truth maintenance system itself; (ii) the problem solver; and (iii) the interface unit. The TMS guarantees that the conclusions reached by the problem solver are kept updated and coherent. However it only deals with propositions (usually substituted by arbitrary identifiers called nodes) and their dependencies. For each proposition there will be a node and for each dependency a justification which describes how the node was deduced from other nodes. The TMS has three basic operations: (i) create a new assumption node whenever new propositions are assumed to be true; (ii) create a new ordinary node when a new proposition is deduced by the problem solver; and (iii) add a new justification to an existing node whenever the
