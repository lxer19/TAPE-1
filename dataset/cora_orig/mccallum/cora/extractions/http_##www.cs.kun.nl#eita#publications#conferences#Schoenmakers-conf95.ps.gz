Abstract: The classification performance of a neural network for combined six-band Landsat-TM and one-band ERS-1/SAR PRI imagery from the same scene is carried out. Different combinations of the data | either raw, segmented or filtered |, using the available ground truth polygons, training and test sets are created. The training sets are used for learning while the test sets are used for verification of the neural network. The different combinations are evaluated here.

Reference-contexts: The segmentation method The segmentation method used [7] is capable of segmenting large image scenes ( 6000fi6000 pixels). The method is a combination of an improved edge detection method [6] [2], [4] and a region growing method [9], <ref> [1] </ref>. The edge detector is applied to compute per pixel an edge magnitude and an edge direction. Using the thresholded [3] magnitudes and the direction, an edge following algorithm [4] is carried out selecting the best candidates for final edge fragment composition.

Reference-contexts: The experiments carried out To compare the influence of speckle filtering in the classification, the ERS-1/SAR PRI image has been speckle filtered by the method as described in <ref> [5] </ref>. Together with the segmentation method described above, 8 data sets were produced. For the 1 band SAR data no segmentation was performed, as the average classification performance (ACP) was low for the speckle filtered SAR image, and segmentation was not expected to improve the ACP significantly.

Reference-contexts: The availability of the polygons of the ground truth data made it possible to extract for each data set the training and the test data. These data are used to classify both the un-segmented and segmented images. Compared to previously reported experiments <ref> [8] </ref> which had an ACP of 70%, here results of 93% ACP are achieved. However, the former experiments contained less data (12 K pixels) and more classes (16).
