Abstract: During the planning process, a planner may often have many different options for what kind of plan refinement to perform next (for example, what task or goal to work on next, what operator or method to use to achieve the task or goal, or how to resolve a conflict or enforce some constraint in the plan). The planner's efficiency depends greatly on how well it chooses among these options. In this paper, we present and compare two types of strategies that an HTN planner may use to select which task to decompose next. Both strategies facilitate efficient planning by making it easier for the planner to identify plans that can be pruned from the search space|but since the strategies accomplish this in two different ways, each works better on different kinds of problems. We present experimental results showing how characteristics of the planning domain can be used to predict which strategy will work best, so that these domain characteristics can be used to select strategies across application domains when building practical planning systems.

Reference-contexts: FAF performs better than LtoR, but not as well as ExCon-FAF or ExCon-LtoR. The performances of ExCon-LtoR and ExCon-FAF are similar because for the problem with highly interleaved goal tasks, ExCon selects tasks and does not have to use its tie-breaking strategy (i.e. LtoR or FAF). Translog Domain Translog <ref> (Andrews et al. 1995) </ref> is a transport logistics domain where the methods of transportation are specified based on the locations, the types of packages, and availabilities of the necessary equipment. It is a considerably larger domain than many used in planning.

Reference-contexts: Many heuristics have been developed for domain independent HTN planning systems, most notably O-Plan <ref> (Currie & Tate 1991) </ref> and SIPE-2 (Wilkins 1990) including some heuristics which are evaluated in this paper. However, little analysis has been done to explain the relationships between each heuristic's performance and domain characteristics, and to evaluate the performances based on them. <p> Similarly, the ExCon-LtoR strategy should be able to outperform the ExCon-FAF strategy in such problem domains. To test these hypotheses, we implemented four task selection strategies, FAF, LtoR, 3 ExCon-FAF, and 2 In fact, O-Plan's refinement choice mechanism <ref> (Currie & Tate 1991) </ref> has been using a combination of the FAF heuristic called Branch-1 with a Branch-N heuristic that estimates how many possibilities lie down the refinement path if it is taken.

Reference-contexts: It is a considerably larger domain than many used in planning. It is specified with 17 compound tasks, 42 primitive actions, and 29 predicates. We have randomly chosen 10 problems from the one-package problems created by Kettler <ref> (Kettler 1995) </ref> for this experiment. Table 2 lists the results. For one-package (i.e. one goal task) problems, there are many ordering constraints among the subtasks. So the relative performances of the task selection strategies are similar to the low ! values problems in the Random Travel Planning domain.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, some only use for query conditions may be considered external conditions. For a summary and comparisons of condition types used in O-Plan2, Nonlin and SIPE-2, see <ref> (Tate, Drabble, & Dalton 1994) </ref>. After some method M is instantiated, every external condition of M becomes one of the applicability conditions in the partial plan: the conditions that must be established if the plan is to be successful.

Reference-contexts: Here, we give a brief description of what external conditions are and how the planner can use them to select tasks. The formal definition of external conditions and the complete algorithm of the ExCon strategy will be presented in another paper <ref> (Tsuneto, Hendler, & Nau 1998) </ref>. External conditions can be described intuitively as follows. Suppose that to accomplish some task in a plan P, we decide to use some method M.
