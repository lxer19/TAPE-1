Title: Communicative Actions in a Dialogue Model for Cooperative Discourse: an initial report

Abstract: In this paper, we present a dialogue model, and an underlying theory of action, which supports representing and reasoning about communicative and noncommunicative actions in written dialogues. Communicative and noncommunicative actions are represented with the same structures, and they are reasoned with according to the same rules. They are the building blocks of a dynamic structure called a planification graph, built as the dialogue proceeds, and representing the agents' beliefs as to how all of the acts underlying the agents' discourse, communicative as well as noncommunicative, are related at a given point in the dialogue. The cotreatment of communicative and noncommunicative actions further involves the interleaving of planning (construction of the planification graph) and execution, modeled by an algorithm of task advancement which allows the system to determine when to produce an utterance and what it should contain. We simulate the processing of our model on sample dialogues extracted from a corpus of human-human dialogues recorded at a telephone switchboard in an industrial setting.

Reference-contexts: develop the Speech Act Identification module of our model, examining the nature of discourse segmentation in order to define more precisely the operations on the focus stack component of discourse structure, and, finally, dealing with more complex utterances, such as those described in previous work of one of the authors <ref> (Balkanski 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Our knowledge base contains information about the entities that were revealed by our corpus analysis, that is, actions, recipes, entities, as well as information about these entities. For our syntactic/semantic front-end, we use a parser based on an LFG grammar <ref> (Bresnan 1981) </ref> and a semantic interpreter based on conceptual graphs (Sowa 1984) that have been developed by members of our research group (Briffault et al. 1996). We are in the process of implementing the Plan Reasoner.

Reference-contexts: The achieveHaveValue recipe, however, is different in that it also models the request for information aspect of the recipe. formalisms <ref> (e.g. Bunt 1989, Sadek 1991) </ref>, are implicitly expressed in our model. Indeed, by virtue of being inserted into a planification graph, the actions and relations contained in a recipe become the objects of beliefs and intentions in the agent being modeled.

Reference-contexts: Corpus analysis The domain we will use to illustrate our model is that of a telephone switchboard. Our corpus consists of a set of human-human task-oriented dialogues, selected and transcribed from a day-long recording of a telephone switchboard in an industrial setting <ref> (Castaing 1993) </ref>. The full recording contains about 500 dialogues, varying in length from three exchanges to almost thirty.

Reference-contexts: Our model is based on the theory of collaborative discourse developed by Grosz and Sidner (1986, 1990), and further extended by Lochbaum (1994, 1995). This work rests on the claim that discourses involve collaborative behavior, and is centered around the notion of a SharedPlan <ref> (Grosz and Sidner 1990) </ref>, introduced to model the set of beliefs and intentions that agents must hold for their collaboration to be successful. Agents start out with a partial shared plan, and gradually complete it with additional beliefs and intentions, acquired as the dialogue proceeds.

Reference-contexts: It also implies that the agent being modeled believes that G1 and G2 both believe that they can perform the actions for which they are the agent, which requires, among other conditions, that they can identify the parameters of these actions <ref> (Lochbaum 1994) </ref>. AchieveHaveValue (G1, P) RequestValue (G1, G2, P) InformValue (G2, G1, P) achieveHaveValue Our example consists of the following dialogue. ( 1 ) &lt;telephone call&gt; ( 2 ) S y s t e m : Hello. ( 3 ) User: Hello. I would like to speak to Mr. <p> If it cannot find a recipe, or if no none of the recipes it knows are compatible with the graph, then it adds to the graph the ObtainRecipe action (and associated recipe), connected by an enablement link with Ai. This will lead to a knowledge precondition subdialogue <ref> (Lochbaum 94) </ref>. - R3 (Ai's status = 3 and Ai's agent is the system): the PR verifies that all of Ai's parameters are instantiated, and that all its constraints satisfied. If so, it executes Ai, and returns it with a status of 5.

Reference-contexts: Beliefs and intentions of agents concerning knowledge about parameters, which are explicitly expressed in other 5 The AchieveHaveValue action is similar to Lochbaum's Achieve (has.sat.descr) action which she uses to handle knowledge preconditions <ref> (Lochbaum 95) </ref>. The achieveHaveValue recipe, however, is different in that it also models the request for information aspect of the recipe. formalisms (e.g. Bunt 1989, Sadek 1991), are implicitly expressed in our model. <p> This consists in adding the action AchieveHaveValue, and its recipe, to the planification graph, connected by an enablement link to the LookUpPhoneNumber action (since the goal of this action is to satisfy a knowledge precondition of LookUpPhoneNumber <ref> (Lochbaum 95) </ref>). The resulting graph is given in Figure 10. The request for confirmation simply reflects the way the system tries to resolve the contradiction between the instantiation proposed by the user and the ones it has.
