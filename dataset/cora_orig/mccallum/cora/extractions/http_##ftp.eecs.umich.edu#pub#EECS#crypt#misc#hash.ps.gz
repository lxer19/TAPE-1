Abstract: Fast message integrity and authentication services are very important in today's high-speed network protocols. Current message authentication techniques are mostly encryption-based which is undesirable for several reasons. In this brief paper, we introduce encryption-free message authentication based entirely on the use of one-way hash functions. Two methods are presented and their strength is analyzed. The security of the proposed methods is based on the strength of the underlying one-way hash function.

Reference-contexts: MD4 is considered by many in the security community to be the most promising hash function (partly because the two-pass version of SNEFRU was broken by Biham and Shamir in 1990 <ref> [2] </ref>). In this paper we explore some new applications of one-way hash functions. Hereafter, MD4 (MD5 is substantially similar) is used as the example function. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: This is because a message digest is computed with a secret suffix as the last input block. Without knowing the secret, the intruder can not, with any certainty, append (or prepend) to the message. One drawback of the secret suffix is its susceptibility to the so-called Birthday attack <ref> [3] </ref>. In brief, this attack consists of the intruder generating a message trial pool of size R and recording a sample pool of genuine messages of size S. <p> See <ref> [3] </ref> for a detailed discussion. M D4 (S AB jjM ) = M D4 (S AB jj ~ M) 6 Envelope Method At present time, a protocol requiring 2 128 operations to break can be considered quite strong.

Reference-contexts: SNMP, as stated above, already implements the secret prefix method. Also, network-layer and routing protocols, e.g., SDNS SP3 [14], Inter-Domain Policy Routing (IDPR) [15] and Visa Protocol <ref> [4] </ref>, can benefit substantially from inexpensive, encryption-free message authentication. 9 Conclusions In summary, fast one-way hash functions such as MD4/5 can be used as a foundation for some relatively novel implementations of security services.

Reference-contexts: The secret prefix method was developed independently by the Internet Security and Privacy Working Group (SPWG) for use in Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) <ref> [6] </ref>. 2 5 Informal Analysis Throughout the following discussion it is assumed that an intruder has the ability to record and analyze messages as well as insert fraudulent messages into the message stream. <p> An obvious countermeasure for this type of attack is to require that the message length be included in the secret prefix calculation, e.g., as part of the first block. Some protocols already include length as part of the message header format (e.g., IP [9], SNMP <ref> [6] </ref>). 5.3 Secret Suffix A brute force attack on the secret suffix variant is similar in that the intruder would need to try on the average 2 128 possibilities before discovering an ^ S such that M D4 (M jj ^ S) = M D4 (M jjS AB ).

Reference-contexts: However, encryption technology is still unable to match the bandwidth requirements of high-speed protocols in a cost-effective manner. For this reason, alternative approaches are being considered. In recent years, some important advances were made in development of fast one-way hash functions. Two notable examples are Merkle's SNEFRU <ref> [7] </ref>, Rivest's MD4 Message Digest algorithm [11] and the more recent (but slower) MD5 Message Digest Algorithm [12]. All of these hash functions are aimed at high-speed software implementations and all are currently in the public domain.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, there exist secure means of principal authentication <ref> [8, 16, 13] </ref>. At the time of session initiation, after mutual authentication is achieved, one of principals, say, A, generates a random 512-bit value, S AB . A then communicates S AB to B in secret (using encryption, if necessary).

Reference-contexts: Typically, this is due to hardware initialization/invocation overhead (which is amortized for large units of data). Software implementations (MD4 being a case in point) tend to exhibit constant data rates irrespective of data sizes. * Encryption algorithms are covered by patents Some encryption and signature algorithms (e.g., RSA <ref> [10] </ref>) are patented and must be licensed; with obvious cost implications. * All encryption algorithms are subject to export con trol This is one of the chief arguments against the use of encryption for message authentication. For example, the United States Government places export restrictions on certain cryptographic paraphernalia.
