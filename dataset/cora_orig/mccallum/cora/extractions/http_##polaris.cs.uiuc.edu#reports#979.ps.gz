Abstract: In this paper we introduce two special classes of matrices U and V in C nfin which are a generalization of reflexive and antireflexive matrices and present their fundamental properties. The matrices U and V have the relations U = P fl U P and V = P fl V P where the superscript fl denotes the conjugate transpose and P is some unitary matrix of order n with the property P k = I, k 2. I is the identity matrix, and k is assumed to be the smallest positive integer for which the relations hold. The matrices U and V are referred to as circulative and anticirculative matrices, respectively. After introducing these two classes of matrices and developing general theories associated with them, we then discuss their special cases and in particular define another two special classes of matrices, to be referred to as rotative and antirotative matrices, which are a special case of the circulative/anticirculative matrices on one hand and a generalization of (block) circulant/anticirculant matrices on the other.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In [ChSa87] and <ref> [Chen88] </ref> we presented two special classes of matrices A and B in C nfin with the relations A = P AP and B = P BP (1) where P is some reflection (symmetric signed permutation) matrix. The matrices A and B are referred to as reflexive and antireflexive matrices, respectively. <p> For example, a matrix circulative with respect to P is also a reflexive matrix if the matrix P is restricted to some reflection matrix (or symmetric signed permutation matrix) <ref> [Chen88] </ref>, [ChSa89a]. On the other hand, a matrix reflexive with respect to some reflection matrix P is always a circulative matrix since any reflection matrix is necessarily a circulation matrix.

Reference-contexts: After introducing these two classes of matrices and developing general theories associated with them, we then define another two special classes of matrices, to be referred to as rotative and antirotative matrices, which are a generalization of (block) circulant/anticirculant matrices <ref> [Davi79] </ref>. Arising from a wide class of scientific and engineering applications, the matrices U possess several special properties which are not only theoretically interesting but computationally useful. In addition to including reflexive matrices as a special case, this class of matrices also contains rotative matrices as another important special one. <p> The generalized inverse of a matrix A is typically defined to be the unique matrix X which satisfies the following four Moore-Penrose conditions <ref> [Davi79] </ref>: (a) AXA = A; (b) XAX = X; Premultiplying and postmultiplying both sides of (a) by P fl and P , respectively, and using the fact that P is unitary, we obtain P fl AP P fl A + P P fl AP = P fl AP (4) where we <p> It should be mentioned that the order of U , and accordingly that of T l , depends on which U i is taken by U . Before going any further, let us define a block circulant matrix C <ref> [Davi79] </ref>, C = 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 4 C k1 C 0 C 1 : : : : : : : : C 2 : C 0 C 1 3 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 ; (13) C = bcirc (C 0 ; C 1 ; <p> P T AP , we have from (17) A = Q T S T ASQ = S T Q T AQS or, equivalently, QAQ T = S T AS and SAS T = Q T AQ: Since any (block) circulant matrix C has the relation C = S T CS <ref> [Davi79] </ref> and the rotation matrix P reduces to S if Q is taken to be the identity matrix, it is obvious that the class of circulant matrices is a special case of that of rotative matrices and, accordingly, a special case of that of circulative matrices.
