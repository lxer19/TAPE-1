Abstract: Programming by Human Demonstration is an intuitive method to program a robot. The user, acting as the teacher or programmer, shows how a particular task is performed, using an interface device that allows the measurement and recording of applied commands and the data simultaneously perceived by the robot's sensors. This paper presents an extension of this method to the interactive acquisition of elementary robot skills. Based on a model of control tasks, the knowledge that is necessary to perform those tasks is identified. The actual process of generating and applying a controller and procedures supporting the individual design steps are defined. Last, an interactive programming environment is described that supports the skill acquisition during all phases.

Reference-contexts: In telerobotics, robots provide the capability to autonomously execute certain operations and relieve the operator from difficult control tasks. These individual capabilities are referred to as skills, the concept itself is also known as shared autonomy ([4], [18], [20]). In robot programming, SKills-Oriented Robot Programming (SKORP, see <ref> [1] </ref>) relies on the existence of a set of skills as the building blocks of a robot program (see also [7], [9], [10], [14]). The approaches to skill learning are mainly aiming at identifying a control function for a given task. <p> Similarly, sampled data at the beginning or end of a single phase are used as training data for the monitoring functions which realize a mapping &lt; n 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. 4.

Reference-contexts: These initial design steps will usually not result in an optimal controller. They will, however, result in a controller that is operational and can be refined on-line by means of reinforcement learning ([3], <ref> [19] </ref>). During the refinement phase, examples can provide the following knowledge: 1. The range of sensorial inputs as measured during teaching defines an interval in which an individual input value can be considered valid.
