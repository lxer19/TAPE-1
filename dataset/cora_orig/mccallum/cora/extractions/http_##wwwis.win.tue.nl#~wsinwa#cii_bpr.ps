Reference-contexts: In this paper high-level Petri nets are proposed as a tool for the modelling and analysis of business processes. Petri nets have proven to be useful in the context of logistics and production control (cf. <ref> [3, 11] </ref>). However, the application of these Petri nets is not restricted to logistics and manufacturing, they can also be used to support business process re-engineering efforts. High-level Petri nets are based on the classical Petri net model introduced by Carl Adam Petri ([14]). <p> Systems are connected to places by means of connectors. In the remainder of this paper we will refer to Petri nets extended with `colour', `time' and `hierarchy' as high-level Petri nets. For more information on these nets, the reader is referred to <ref> [1, 3, 9, 10] </ref>. 3.3 Analysis of Petri nets The complexity of the design and control problems encountered in modern business processes is increasing. Therefore, we need methods and techniques to support both the mod-elling and analysis of these processes. <p> The value of such a token contains information about the object represented by the token. Most tokens have some unique identity, e.g. a document number or a case number. Procedures are represented by systems. Systems may be composed of subsystems (see section 3.2 and <ref> [3] </ref>). Therefore, it is possible to nest procedures, i.e. a complex procedure may be composed of less complex procedures. The result of the `how'-phase is a partially ordered set of tasks, represented in terms of a Petri net.

Reference-contexts: This representation can be used as a starting point for various kinds of analysis. In a sense, the Petri net representation serves as a `solver-independent' medium between the problem situation and the method (s) of analysis. Compared to many other BPR-tools (cf.

Reference-contexts: Then we show how the `'What, how and by whom?" approach can be used to map business processes onto a high-level Petri net. This is illustrated by an example. 2 Business process (re)design Re-engineering business processes means tossing aside existing processes and starting over. In Hammer and Champy <ref> [7] </ref> business process redesign (re-engineering) is defined as "the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical contemporary measures of performance such as costs, quality and speed". <p> In this paper we will concentrate on rethinking business processes. We will not discuss the organisational aspects of BPR, the role of information technology nor management and training issues. For discussions on these other important subjects, the reader is referred to Davenport [5], Hammer [6], Hammer and Champy <ref> [7] </ref> and Morris and Brandon [12]. By narrowing BPR down like this, three important themes emerge: what, how and by whom? 2.1 What? What are the prime objectives of a company or business unit? An attempt to re-engineer a business process should always start with this question. <p> We can think of a such step as a task or an activity. Then we determine the ordering of these steps, e.g. task a has to be executed before task b, but a can be executed in parallel with task c. In Hammer and Champy <ref> [7] </ref> a number of guidelines are given to support this activity: * The steps in a process should be performed in a natural order. * Avoid fragmentation of related activities. * If possible, several steps are combined into one. * If possible, tasks are allowed to be executed in parallel. * <p> We have seen that the rethinking of business processes boils down to answering the "What, how and by whom?" question. In the remainder we will concentrate on a formalism to support this task. 3 High-level Petri nets As indicated by Hammer and Champy <ref> [7] </ref>, BPR is characterized by four keywords: fundamental, radical, dramatic and process. Therefore we need a framework for modelling processes which forces the user to examine the core of the business process, thus supporting radical and dramatic changes. In this paper we use a framework based on high-level Petri nets.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the resource manager uses more information about the task to be scheduled. By assigning a priority to each task, we can favour an important task above less important tasks. We can use most of the priority rules for rule-based scheduling (cf. Haupt <ref> [8] </ref>). Typical priority rules are: SPT (shortest processing time), MWKR (most work remaining), LWKR (least work remaining), DD (earliest due-date), etc. resource manager. However, we can automate the construction of this part of the figure.

By narrowing BPR down like this, three important themes emerge: what, how and by whom? 2.1 What? What are the prime objectives of a company or business unit? An attempt to re-engineer a business process should always start with this question. <p> Diagramming techniques such as flowcharts, decision trees, Warnier-Orr diagrams, state transition diagrams, fishbone diagrams, hierarchy charts, dataflow diagrams and business activity maps (cf. Morris and Brandon <ref> [12] </ref>) have been used to represent business processes. Most of these techniques suffer from two important drawbacks: (1) the lack of formal semantics and (2) the absence of powerful analysis methods and tools. High-level Petri nets have a formal semantics.

Reference-contexts: Since then the use and study of Petri nets has increased considerably. For a review of the history of Petri nets and an extensive bibliography the reader is referred to Murata <ref> [13] </ref>. The classical Petri net is a directed bipartite graph with two node types called places and transitions. The nodes are connected via directed arcs. Connections between two nodes of the same type are not allowed. <p> the two transitions fire alternately, i.e. the clerk modelled by this net can only process one document at a time. 3.2 Adding colour, time and hierarchy The classical Petri net model has been used in many application areas, e.g. communication protocols, flexible manufacturing systems and distributed information systems (see Murata <ref> [13] </ref>). However, Petri nets describing real systems tend to be complex and extremely large. To solve these problems, many authors propose extensions of the basic Petri net model. We will discuss three of these extensions; `colour', `time' and `hierarchy'. <p> Compared to many other BPR-tools (cf. Bradley et al. [4]) analysis in not restricted to simulation!
