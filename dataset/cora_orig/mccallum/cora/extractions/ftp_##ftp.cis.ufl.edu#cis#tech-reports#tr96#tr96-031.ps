Abstract: While complex behavior can be generated through simple systems, as in chaotic and nonlinear systems, complex systems are found where a systems study contains multiple physical objects and interactions. Through the use of hierarchy, we are able to simplify and organize the complex system. Every level within the hierarchy may be refined into another level. System abstraction involves simplification through structural system representation as well as through behavioral approximations of executed model structure. There has been little work on creating a unified taxonomy for model abstraction. We present such a taxonomy and define two major sub-fields of model abstraction, while illustrating both sub-fields through detailed examples. The introduction of this taxonomy provides system and simulation researchers with a way in which to view and manage complex systems.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, recently introduced wavelet decomposition achieves the same quality of approximation with a network of reduced size by replacing the neurons by "wavelons", i.e. computing units obtained by cascading an affine transform and multidimensional wavelets <ref> (Ahang and Ben-veniste 1992) </ref>. Table 1 summarizes the based categories along with some sample abstraction techniques discussed so far.

Reference-contexts: Model components, which serve as fundamental building blocks for models, take on the data values. Sample model components include state and event <ref> (Fishwick 1995) </ref>. We sub-define structural abstraction of a system into data abstraction and model abstraction. * Data Abstraction : abstraction of input, output, time, parameter system values or time dependent trajectories. * Model Abstraction : abstraction of dynamical models. <p> Examples of homogeneous-structural abstraction are conceptual, declarative, functional, constraint and spatial modeling. Detailed discussion on each model type is shown in <ref> (Fishwick 1995) </ref>. Models must be multi-layered so that different abstraction levels of the model respond to different needs of the analyst. In heterogeneous-structural abstraction, different abstraction levels of a system are provided by allowing either homogeneous or heterogeneous model types together under one structure.

Reference-contexts: Given that we have developed this taxonomy, a good question is "What to do with it?" We are developing a system called MOOSE <ref> (Fishwick 1996b) </ref>, standing for multimodeling object oriented simulation environment, in which the taxonomy is to be applied. MOOSE models are constructed using a graphical user interface which begins with the user specifying an object oriented class hierarchy. This procedure takes advantage of structural abstraction.

Reference-contexts: We replace a system component with something more generic that approximates, to some degree of accuracy, the behavior of the system component at its refined levels. Therefore, discarding the refined levels that define a system component will still result in a complete behavioral description of a system <ref> (Fishwick and Lee 1996) </ref>. By incorporating behavioral abstraction approaches into multimodel-ing allows each level to be understood independetly of the others. This is why we put multimodeling on the top of our taxonomy.

Reference-contexts: The regression coefficients c 1 ; c 2 ; :::; c n are determined by solving a system of simultaneous linear equations: Ac = y <ref> (Law and Kelton 1991) </ref>. Figure 6 shows the result. The approximation is poor in the graph's central region because linear regression is done by polynomial fit, and so it generates a monotonically increasing function. 3.2.2 Dynamic Approach In the dynamic approach, we're interested in time dependent behavior.

Reference-contexts: White and red blood cells are produced in bone marrow. From the marrow they enter the blood cir culatory system. As the oxygen level decreases in the body, there is a feedback back to the bone marrow-which produces more cells. Mackey and Glass <ref> (Mackey and Glass 1977) </ref> provide a delay model for hematopoieses of the following form: dP (t) = m + P m (t T ) where, : the flux of cells into the blood stream, P (t) : the concentration of cells (the population species) in the circulating blood (cells=mm 3 ),

Reference-contexts: Figure 10 displays the time trajectory for the total concentration of blood cells when the sampling period is increased by 100, which introduces more nonlinearity and instability. We choose Figure 10 as the abstraction target and use for input. ADALINE was developed by Widrow and Hoff <ref> (Widrow and Sterns 1985) </ref>. Their neural network model differs from the perceptronq in that ADALINE neurons have a linear transfer function. The ADA-LINE network also enables the Widrow-Hoff learning rule, known as the Least Mean Square (LMS) rule, to adjust weights and biases according to the magnitude of errors.
