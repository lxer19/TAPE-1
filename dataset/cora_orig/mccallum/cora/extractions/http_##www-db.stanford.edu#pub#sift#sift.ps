Abstract: The dissemination model is becoming increasingly important in wide-area information system. In this model, the user subscribes to an information dissemination service by submitting profiles that describe his interests. He then passively receives new, filtered information. The Stanford Information Filtering Tool (SIFT) is a tool to help provide such service. It supports full-text filtering using well-known information retrieval models. The SIFT filtering engine implements novel indexing techniques, capable of processing large volumes of information against a large number of profiles. It runs on several major Unix platforms and is freely available to the public. In this paper we present SIFT's approach to user interest modeling and user-server communication. We demonstrate the processing capability of SIFT by describing a running server that disseminates USENET News. We present an empirical study of SIFT's performance, examining its main memory requirement and ability to scale with information volume and user population.

Reference-contexts: Government, or CNRI. emerged for network information finding and discovery; e.g., Wide-Area Information Servers (WAIS) [KM91], archie [ED92], World-Wide Web (WWW) <ref> [BLCGP92] </ref>, and gopher [McC92]. However, these new tools have one important missing element. They provide a means to search for existing information, but lack a mechanism for continuously informing the user of new information. <p> In the interactive mode, the user subscribes, test-runs a profile, views, updates, or cancels his subscriptions. In the passive mode, the user periodically receives information updates. Instead of developing a new communication protocol, we make use of current technologies: email [Cro82] and World-Wide Web HTTP <ref> [BLCGP92] </ref>. First we discuss the interactive communication mode. Email communication is the lowest common denominator of network connectivity. By having an email interface, a SIFT server is accessible from users with less powerful machines, with limited network capability, or behind Internet-access firewalls.

It parses email messages, assuming the format in <ref> [Cro82] </ref>. User requests are processed by accessing the subscription database and the document index (for test runs). The program wwwui is a so-called "cgi-script" for use with the HTTP daemon released by National Center for Supercomputing Applications.

Reference-contexts: In an information filtering setting, a key question is how many documents to return to the user. We could have allowed the user to receive a fixed number of top ranked documents per update period, e.g., as done in <ref> [FD92] </ref>. However, this is not very desirable: in a period when there are many relevant documents, he may miss some (low recall 1 ); in a period when there are few interesting documents, he may receive irrelevant ones (low precision 1 ).

Reference-contexts: We describe the implementation of SIFT, focusing on the filtering engine. Finally we present an empirical study of SIFT's performance, examining its main memory requirement and ability to scale with information volume and user population. 2 Other Previous Work Boston Community Information System <ref> [GBBL85] </ref> is an experimental information dissemination system. Like SIFT, it allows a finer granularity of interest matching than mailing lists or Netnews. Users can express their interests with IR-style, keyword-based profiles. The system broadcasts new information via radio channel to all users, who then apply their own filters locally.

Reference-contexts: To provide the same kind of filtering power as SIFT would require much local processing. It is more cost-effective to pool profiles together to share the processing overhead. The Tapestry system <ref> [GNOT92] </ref> is a research prototype that uses the relational model for matching user interests and documents; filtering computation is done not on the properties of individual documents, but rather on the entire append-only document database. Efficient query processing techniques are proposed for handling this kind of queries.

Reference-contexts: He will then passively receive documents filtered according to the profiles. Such a service will become increasingly important and form an indispensable tool for the dynamic environment of wide-area information systems. A very simple kind of information dissemination service is already available on the Internet: mailing lists (see e.g., <ref> [Kro92] </ref>). Hundreds of mailing lists exist, covering a wide variety of topics. The user subscribes to lists of interest to him and receives messages on the topic via email. He may also send messages to the lists to reach other subscribers. LIST-SERV is a software system for maintaining mailing lists. <p> A user whose information need does not exactly match certain lists will either receive too many irrelevant or too few relevant messages. The USENET News (or Net 1 news) system <ref> [Kro92] </ref>, an electronic bulletin board system on the Internet, is similar in nature to mailing lists. While Netnews is extremely successful with millions of users and megabytes of daily traffic, at the same time it often creates an information overload.

Reference-contexts: While the radio communication channel makes broadcast inexpensive, local processing of mostly irrelevant information is very expensive. (For every user, a personal computer is dedicated for this purpose this is cited as a major source of complaints from the users.) Information Lens <ref> [MGT + 87] </ref> provides categorization and filtering of semi-structured messages such as email. The user defines rules for filtering, and the processing is done at the user site. It provides effective filtering, but local processing is expensive for large-scale information dissemination.

Reference-contexts: A subscription is identified by the email address of the user and a subscription identifier. 3.1.1 Filtering Model The interest profile can be expressed in one of two IR models: boolean and vector space <ref> [Sal89] </ref>. We first focus on the vector space model. In vector space model, queries and documents are identified by terms, usually words. <p> After the user receives some periodic updates, he may decide to modify his profile or change the threshold for vector space profiles. He may do this by accessing the SIFT server. Furthermore, for vector space profiles, relevance feedback <ref> [Sal89] </ref>, a well-known technique in IR to improve retrieval effectiveness, can be used. <p> The major changes are to support the use of relevance threshold and the processing of boolean queries. The modified waisindex code is included in our SIFT distribution. 4.2 Filtering Engine Implementation In IR, to efficient process queries against a collection of documents, an inverted index <ref> [Sal89] </ref> of documents is built, which associates a word with its occurrences in the documents. In the information filtering scenario, we may use the same approach: an index is built of a batch of new documents, and profiles are treated as stored queries that are run periodically.

Reference-contexts: Efficient query processing techniques are proposed for handling this kind of queries. Tapestry is built on top of a commercial relational database system. The Pasadena system <ref> [WF91] </ref> investigates the effectiveness of different IR techniques in filtering. It collects new documents from several Internet information sources, and periodically run profiles against them. Similar to SIFT, it uses a clearinghouse approach, but efficient filtering is not addressed.

Reference-contexts: The proportionality constants are roughly half of those based on a document index. The sending out of email notifications consumes a major portion of the SIFT running time. To improve this, a more sophisticated document delivery scheme is needed. One idea is to group users geographically <ref> [YGM94a] </ref>. If a document matches one of the users in a group, a single copy of the document is sent to the group. A local distribution site for the group receives the copy and retransmits it to users locally.

Reference-contexts: The Pasadena system [WF91] investigates the effectiveness of different IR techniques in filtering. It collects new documents from several Internet information sources, and periodically run profiles against them. Similar to SIFT, it uses a clearinghouse approach, but efficient filtering is not addressed. In <ref> [YGM94b, YGM94c] </ref> we proposed a variety of indexing techniques for speeding up information filtering under IR models. There we evaluated these techniques using analysis and simulation. The SIFT filtering engine is a real implementation of one class of index structures that we found to be efficient.
