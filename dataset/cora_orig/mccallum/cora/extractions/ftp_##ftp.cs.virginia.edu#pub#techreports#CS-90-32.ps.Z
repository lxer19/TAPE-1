Author: W. Timothy Strayer 
Abstract: Computer Science Report No. TR-90-32 December 5, 1990

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Each extant media access protocol is designed to provide some form of discrimination between messages, whether it is decidedly nothing (as in Ethernet [IEEE85a]), or class-based (as in Token Bus [IEEE85b] and FDDI <ref> [ANSI86] </ref>), or priority-based (as in Token Ring [IEEE85c] and SAE High Speed Ring Bus [SAE87]). Users provide some ranking information and the media access protocol acts upon it.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Each extant media access protocol is designed to provide some form of discrimination between messages, whether it is decidedly nothing (as in Ethernet [IEEE85a]), or class-based (as in Token Bus [IEEE85b] and FDDI [ANSI86]), or priority-based (as in Token Ring <ref> [IEEE85c] </ref> and SAE High Speed Ring Bus [SAE87]). Users provide some ranking information and the media access protocol acts upon it. With priority-based protocols, the goal is to provide the best service (i.e., lowest latency) to the highest priority messages without regard to fairness to the lower priority messages.
