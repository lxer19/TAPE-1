Abstract: In this chapter we describe a stock market simulation in which stock market participants use genetic algorithms to gradually improve their trading strategies over time. A variety of experiments show that, under certain conditions, some market participants can make consistent profits over an extended period of time, a finding that might explain the success of some real-world money managers. These experiments suggest a four parameter model of market participants. Each participant can be described along four dimensions: information set, constraint set, algorithm set, and model set. The information set captures what data the participant has access to (e.g., the participant has access to all historical price data). The constraint set describes under what restrictions the participant operates (e.g., the participant can borrow money at 1% above the prime rate). The algorithm set indicates what programs the participant can use (e.g., the participant is restricted to hill-climbing optimization algorithms). The model set specifies the language which the participant employs to describe its findings (e.g., the participant uses stochastic differential equations). This four parameter model explains the relative strengths and weaknesses of market participants. After describing the market participant model, we briefly turn to a critique of neural networks, which are the most widely used artificial intelligence tools for financial time series analysis. We have applied some of the insights that we have gained from doing this and related research to our own trading accounts. We participated in the 1993 U.S. Investing Championships (options division) and finished with a 43.9% return over a period of four months. To leverage this success we have formed a money management firm, called Redfire Capital Management Group, that employs evolutionary algorithms to create fully automated trading strategies for bond, currency, and equity markets. Redfire Capital Management Group launched the first hedge fund that exclusively employs genetic algorithms to create computerized trading strategies on April 3, 1995.

Reference-contexts: Much of their paper describes different approaches to modeling markets, but they do discuss one experiment which compares the performance of agents with different learning strategies and they conclude that adaptive agents out-perform non-adapting ones. LeBaron <ref> [LeB94] </ref> has developed a stock market simulation in which participants learn strategies using a genetic algorithm, as they do in this paper. The strategies of his market participants are encoded as bitstrings in which each bit corresponds to a boolean variable that is precomputed.

Reference-contexts: The mutation operator adds a number uniformly distributed between -.1 and .1 to a coefficient and the crossover operator is traditional single point crossover. The best strategies are selected and copied using standard proportional selection with a constant offset that ensures that all fitness values are positive <ref> [Mic92] </ref>. The fitness values are calculated by subtracting the fair value computed by a strategy from the spot price on the next day. 4 Experiments This section describes three experiments that we have done to explore various facets of our simulation.
