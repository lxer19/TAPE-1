Reference-contexts: Even this simple case requires several dot products and an exponent. For spotlights the calculations can be much more costly, involving another exponent for the light concentration (making the light diminish with angle), and the calculation 2 of attenuation (making the light diminish with distance) <ref> [van Dam 88] </ref>. Given that there are potentially many light sources, we are faced with a computation of the form N X C i (D i L i ) k [A (N L i ) + B (E R i ) s ] (3) for each vertex of each polygon.
