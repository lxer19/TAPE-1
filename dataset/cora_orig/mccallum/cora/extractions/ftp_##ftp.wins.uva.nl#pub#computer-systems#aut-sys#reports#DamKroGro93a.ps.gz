Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of how occupancy values from one occupancy grid can be used to calculate occupancy values in another grid, where the latter is rotated and/or translated with respect to the former. The mapping is described in terms of a neural network, of which the parameters are learned from examples. An activation function is derived taking into account that the input and output values represent probabilities. It is also determined how many points should be taken in a learning sample to optimise learning speed.

Reference-contexts: An occupancy grid partitions the robot's environment in a number of subspaces, each of which is represented by a pixel. The pixel-value gives the probability of the subspace being occupied by some obstacle. These grids can be used in mobile robot navigation <ref> [3, 5, 1] </ref> and in sensor data fusion [6, 4]. Usually, occupancy grids are defined to be `world fixed', i.e., they give a global representation of the working environment and the partitioning of the environment remains unchanged. We have, however, chosen to work with a local representation of the environment.
