Title: Treewidth and Small Separators for Graphs with Small Chordality  
Author: Hans L. Bodlaender Dimitris M. Thilikos 
Date: January 30, 1995  
Abstract: A graph G k-chordal, if it does not contain chordless cycles of length larger than k. The chordality cl of a graph G is the minimum k for which G is k-chordal. The degeneracy or the width of a graph is the maximum min-degree of any of its subgraphs. Our results are the following:

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [1] </ref>, Alon, Seymour, and Thomas provide a considerably more general result and extent the previous applications. They prove a separator theorem for any graph not containing a specific graph as a minor. <p> Moreover our results lead to a linear time algorithm that computes such a separator. As any graph not containing a specific graph as a minor has bounded width, our separator 3 theorem gives an extension of the results in <ref> [1, 33, 34] </ref> for graphs with bounded chordality, and improves the time bounds in [1] for such classes of graphs. We present an application of our separator theorem for the problem of approximating the independent set problem on (s + 2)-chordal graphs with small width. <p> As any graph not containing a specific graph as a minor has bounded width, our separator 3 theorem gives an extension of the results in [1, 33, 34] for graphs with bounded chordality, and improves the time bounds in <ref> [1] </ref> for such classes of graphs. We present an application of our separator theorem for the problem of approximating the independent set problem on (s + 2)-chordal graphs with small width. <p> It seems to be useful to have results that tell how to find separators of small cardinality in graphs, as these have several applications in combination with a divide-and-conquer strategy. For such theorems and applications see e.g. <ref> [34, 33, 1] </ref>. A well known separator result is the following. Theorem 6 Let G = (V; E) be a graph and w : V ! R + a function assigning a positive real weight to each vertex in V . <p> It is easy to prove that any graph that does not contain a specific graph as a minor has constant bounded width. Therefore separator Theorem 12 straightforwardly extents the results of Lipton and Tarjan in [33, 34] and Alon, Sey-mour, and Thomas in <ref> [1] </ref> in the setting of 4-chordal graphs with small width. Moreover, Theorem 12 can give applications for any class of graphs where chordality and width are bounded.

Reference-contexts: Also, width appears in many combinatorial results. For instance, in <ref> [2] </ref>, improved time bounds are presented for algorithms that count and find cycles, when the input graph is considered to have small width. Several parameters characterizing the sparsity of a graph are related to width.

Reference-contexts: For s = 1, Definition 4 gives the width of a graph. An already known corollary of Theorems 4 and 2 is that for chordal graphs, treewidth is equal to width, which is polynomially computable and has an NC approximation algorithm for constant approximation factors &lt; 1 2 (see <ref> [4] </ref>). It can be easily proved that width is bounded for classes of graphs with an excluded minor, i.e. graphs with no minor isomorphic to a given graph H (see [17]).

Reference-contexts: decomposed into a "tree structure" of pieces with at most k + 1 vertices. (For the precise definition, see Section 2.) A series of recent results show that many NP-complete problems become polynomial or even linear time solvable, or belong to NC, when restricted to graphs with small treewidth (see <ref> [5, 7, 9] </ref>).

Arnborg introduced in <ref> [5] </ref> the notion of the elimination dimension of a graph and proved that it is equivalent with treewidth. We give the definition of the s-elimination dimension of a graph introduced in [19]. For the case where s = n 1, this parameter is equivalent to treewidth. <p> As treewidth (G) (2k) s n s , from the proof of Theorem 4 it follows that reversing L, we can obtain an elimination ordering for G. As, when given an elimination ordering, a tree decomposition can be found in linear time (see <ref> [5] </ref>), this leads to a linear time algorithm that finds a 1 2 -separator in G with the required size. Thus we have the following theorem.

Hence, treewidth is NP-complete for the latter type of cobipartite graphs.

Reference-contexts: We mention that the class of weakly chordal graphs is quite a large one, as it contains the classes of co-chordal graphs, chordal bipartite graphs, permutation graphs, trapezoid graphs, tolerance graphs, 2-threshold graphs and others (see also <ref> [18] </ref>). It is known that for chordal bipartite graphs, treewidth is polynomially computable in time O (e 3 ) (see [29]) and pathwidth is NP-complete [28]. Definition 9 A partial order P on a set V is an irreflexive and transitive binary relation on V . <p> We denote the complement of G as G c . Clearly G c is a comparability graph. Hence, G c does not contain an odd chordless cycle (see <ref> [18] </ref>, page 43). If l = 5, then the complement of G c [fv 1 ; : : : ; v 5 g] is also a cycle with five vertices, contradiction.

Reference-contexts: Separator theorems have appeared to play an important role for algorithmic graph theory as these (in combination with a divide and conquer strategy) lead to a series of important complexity results. In <ref> [33] </ref>, Lipton and Tarjan proved that any planar graph with weights assigned to its vertices contains a separator S of size O ( p n), such that all the connected components of G [V S] have total vertex weight at most 2 3 jV j. <p> Moreover our results lead to a linear time algorithm that computes such a separator. As any graph not containing a specific graph as a minor has bounded width, our separator 3 theorem gives an extension of the results in <ref> [1, 33, 34] </ref> for graphs with bounded chordality, and improves the time bounds in [1] for such classes of graphs. We present an application of our separator theorem for the problem of approximating the independent set problem on (s + 2)-chordal graphs with small width. <p> It seems to be useful to have results that tell how to find separators of small cardinality in graphs, as these have several applications in combination with a divide-and-conquer strategy. For such theorems and applications see e.g. <ref> [34, 33, 1] </ref>. A well known separator result is the following. Theorem 6 Let G = (V; E) be a graph and w : V ! R + a function assigning a positive real weight to each vertex in V . <p> It is easy to prove that any graph that does not contain a specific graph as a minor has constant bounded width. Therefore separator Theorem 12 straightforwardly extents the results of Lipton and Tarjan in <ref> [33, 34] </ref> and Alon, Sey-mour, and Thomas in [1] in the setting of 4-chordal graphs with small width. Moreover, Theorem 12 can give applications for any class of graphs where chordality and width are bounded.

We present an application of our separator theorem for the problem of approximating the independent set problem on (s + 2)-chordal graphs with small width. <p> As there are sparse graphs with small width that do not contain small separators (see Lemma 3) we feel that the requirements of small width and small chordality help to approach a characterization of the concept of "usefully sparse", a question posed from Lipton and Tarjan in <ref> [34] </ref> about the existence of separator theorems for non planar sparse graphs. 2 Definitions and preliminary results In this section some definitions and results will be presented, which are useful in later sections. Let G = (V; E) be a finite undirected graph without multiple edges or loops. <p> It seems to be useful to have results that tell how to find separators of small cardinality in graphs, as these have several applications in combination with a divide-and-conquer strategy.

Moreover, Theorem 12 can give applications for any class of graphs where chordality and width are bounded. <p> Let G be a given (s + 2)- chordal graph where width k where k is a fixed constant. By repeatedly finding a separator as in Theorem 12 we can obtain the following immediate generalization of Theorem 3 in <ref> [34] </ref>. Proposition 1 Let s 1, k be constants. Let G be the set of (s + 2)-chordal graphs G with width (G) k, given with a function w : V ! R + assigning weights to the vertices of G such that P v2V w (v) = 1. <p> If now we apply exhaustive search to each connected component, we can find a collection of independent sets whose union is denoted as I. Let I fl be a maximum independent set in G. Following the same arguments as in <ref> [34] </ref> and taking in mind that if width (G) k then jI fl j n 2k+1 , we can conclude to the following: Proposition 2 Given an (s+2)-chordal graph G that has constant width, there is an O (n 2 ) algorithm that finds an independent set I in G with

Reference-contexts: These problems are NP-complete even if we restrict the input graph on cocom-parability graphs [23], bipartite graphs [27] or the complements of bipartite graphs [6]. Moreover, pathwidth remains NP-complete on chordal graphs [22], planar graphs <ref> [38] </ref> and graphs with bounded maximum degree [38]. In Section 3, we prove that treewidth is also NP-complete on graphs with bounded maximum degree. <p> These problems are NP-complete even if we restrict the input graph on cocom-parability graphs [23], bipartite graphs [27] or the complements of bipartite graphs [6].

Cutwidth is NP-complete when restricted to graphs with maximum degree at most three <ref> [38] </ref>. Applying the transformation from [6] to graphs of maximum degree three yields cobipartite graphs where any vertex is connected to at most eight vertices in the clique to which it does not belong. Hence, treewidth is NP-complete for the latter type of cobipartite graphs. <p> Similarly, pathwidth is NP-complete for graphs of maximum degree 3 <ref> [38] </ref>. In this section we show hat if both max-degree and the length of the chordless cycles are bounded, then the treewidth is bounded by a constant, and hence computable in linear time. It also follows that there is a polynomial time algorithm for pathwidth in this case.
