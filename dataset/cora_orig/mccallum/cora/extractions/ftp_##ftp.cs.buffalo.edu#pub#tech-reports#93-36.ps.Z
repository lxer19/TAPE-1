Reference-contexts: Then we present two heuristics: the first one is based on the algorithm by Fisher and Krieger [11]. This heuristic is applicable to any instance of crackdown scheduling with convex response functions (not necessarily polynomials); the second heuristic is an adaptation of the algorithm by Alidaee <ref> [1] </ref>, and can be applied on markets which have differentiable response functions. The framework of the crackdown scheduling problem is complementary to that of the single machine scheduling problem which maximizes profits [11]. <p> While approximation al 19 gorithms for the maximization problem yield solutions within 2=3 of the optimal [11], no bounds are known for the corresponding minimization problem [9]. Therefore, the performance bounds for our algorithms are also of value in single machine scheduling problems (e.g., the problem studied in <ref> [1] </ref>). <p> It has been studied extensively and heuristics have been shown to be very close to the optimal (i.e, at worst 2=3 of the optimal). Unfortunately, the bounds developed do not apply to the corresponding minimization problem. We present instead two heuristics based on heuristics by Fisher-Krieger [11] and Alidaee <ref> [1] </ref> which have been shown empirically to perform well on the single machine scheduling problem. 6.2.1 Convex Response Functions The input to this algorithm is a set of k drug markets 1; 2; : : : ; k, and the output is a schedule . <p> Alidaee <ref> [1] </ref> has found empirically that this heuristic performs better than the one proposed by Fisher-Kreiger on the single machine scheduling problem, but again, its performance has not been evaluated in the context of drug markets. Before closing this section, we present an alternative maximization model for the crackdown scheduling problem.

This property makes the problem difficult to analyze. <p> In fact, as we will show in the following section, it belongs to the class of NP-hard problems, which are believed to be intractable. Besides its useful application in this scenario, this problem is of interest as a natural generalization of existing scheduling problems which have been extensively studied <ref> [2] </ref>. 3 Proof of NP-Completeness of Crackdown Schedul ing Here we show that the Crackdown Scheduling (CS) problem is NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: In effect, crackdowns are predicated on a belief in increasing returns to scale in enforcement. Caulkins [5, 8] presents a quantitative model for predicting the rate of change of dealers with respect to time in a given market under focussed enforcement. Baveja et al. <ref> [4] </ref> analytically demonstrate in the context of Caulkins' model that the simple strategy of using the maximum available enforcement level until the market has collapsed minimizes the total effort which must be expended to collapse a market in most instances. <p> Hence, 2 one can distinguish two types of resource allocation questions. First, at what rate should forces be deployed in a single market? Second, in what order should the markets in a city be attacked? Previous modeling <ref> [4] </ref> of such focused enforcement operations concluded that when a fixed level of enforcement resources is available, the optimal strategy for eliminating an isolated market is (in almost all cases) to "Allocate the full amount of resources from the earliest instant." This simple strategy minimizes the integral of the amount of

It is these efficiency gains which justify unequal deployment of resources. <p> This completes the proof. 2 17 5.4 Linear Response Functions In this subsection we consider the special case in which f i is linear for all i. The exact shape of these response functions is not known of course, but the general shape suggested by Caulkins <ref> [5] </ref> is that of a positive, increasing, convex function. The function should go off to infinity at some finite point because when enough resources are unavailable, the market will never collapse, no matter how long the crackdown goes on.

Reference-contexts: Progress would be made because the level of negative externalities generated per unit sold are almost certainly higher for brazen, street-corner dealing than they are for surreptitious dealing that takes place behind closed doors <ref> [6] </ref>. It does not pose a problem for scheduling because the displacement does not directly affect the other street markets. The first half of this paper will address the case where the majority of displacement is to discreet dealing so displacement to other street markets can be ignored.

Baveja et al. [3] show that one aspect of this increasing returns to scale is that the response functions are convex. Simple polynomials of the form f (X) = m X fi + c for some constant fi 1 can approximate many convex functions.

Reference-contexts: First we consider crackdown scheduling on drug markets with polynomial response functions and suggest three strategies which yield "close-to-optimal" solutions. We also derive bounds on the performance of these algorithms. Then we present two heuristics: the first one is based on the algorithm by Fisher and Krieger <ref> [11] </ref>. This heuristic is applicable to any instance of crackdown scheduling with convex response functions (not necessarily polynomials); the second heuristic is an adaptation of the algorithm by Alidaee [1], and can be applied on markets which have differentiable response functions. <p> The framework of the crackdown scheduling problem is complementary to that of the single machine scheduling problem which maximizes profits <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Lastly, we extend the crackdown scheduling problem to incorporate the dealer displacement effect. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: * Section 2 defines the problem. * Section 3 establishes the problem to be computationally intractable by proving it to be NP-complete <ref> [12] </ref>. * Section 4 gives a dynamic programming formulation of the problem and an exponential time optimal algorithm. * Section 5 considers special cases of the problem. <p> as follows: Given an instance of the crackdown scheduling problem and a integer m, is there a schedule of crackdowns on the given set of markets such that the cost function C () m ? Recall the definition of the minimum weighted tardiness problem, which is a well-known NP-complete problem <ref> [12] </ref>. Definition 2 An instance of the minimum weighted tardiness problem is a set J = f1; 2; : : : ; kg of jobs, such that job i has a fixed processing time ff i , a fixed deadline fi i , and a fixed weight i . <p> an integer m, is there a schedule such that the cost function C () m? We will show that every instance of the weighted tardiness problem reduces to an instance of CS, which will establish that CS is NP-complete, since the minimum weighted tardiness problem is known to be NP-complete <ref> [12] </ref>. Theorem 1 The Crackdown Scheduling problem is NP-complete. Proof Consider an arbitrary instance I of the minimum weighted tardiness problem.

Reference-contexts: For example, Hartford, Connecticut is believed to have about 20 drug markets. Thus, the algorithm will take on the order of 2 20 10 6 steps, which may be computationally feasible. However, Washington, D.C. is believed to have about 90 drug markets <ref> [13] </ref>, for which the algorithm would require on the order of 2 90 10 27 steps, which is impractical.

Reference-contexts: This may seem paradoxical at 11 first, but the belief that the local citizenry perform as much if not more order maintenance as do professionals is gaining credence and underpins much of the philosophy of community policing <ref> [14] </ref>. Furthermore orderly communities, which hopefully include former drug markets at the end of a successful crackdown phase, are relatively resistant to incursions of drug dealing.

Reference-contexts: The cost function is given by Equation 6. C 0 () = t (2) w (1) + t (3) (w (1) + w (2) ) + + t (k) i=1 ! 13 This problem is equivalent to the familiar mean weighted flow time (MWFT) problem <ref> [18] </ref>. In an instance of MWFT, a set J of k jobs J 1 ; J 2 ; : : : ; J k is given, with job J i having running time c i and weight g i . <p> The problem is to find a schedule such that the weighted mean completion flow time is minimized. That is, for a schedule , the value of the cost function which is to be minimized is C () = X g (i) @ j=1 1 A . <ref> [18] </ref> asserts that scheduling the jobs in nonincreasing order of the ratio c i g i yields an optimal solution. Here, market i plays the role of job J i , t i plays the role of g i , and w i plays the role of c i . <p> edges from E such that the sum of the edge weights is minimum, subject to the constraint that no two edges are incident to the same vertex? This is equivalent to solving the minimum weighted bipartite matching problem for G fl , and efficient algorithms are known for this problem <ref> [18] </ref>. 5.3 Equity of Response Functions In Section 5.1 we showed that if the burden of maintaining a market after a crackdown does not reduce the amount of resources available for conducting crackdowns, then the optimal strategy is to schedule crackdowns on markets in nonincreasing order of f i (0) 16

Reference-contexts: Indeed, such organizations were called on to perform some of the short term and much of the long term maintenance following crackdowns in Hartford, Connecticut <ref> [19] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In recent years U.S. drug control policy has given increasing attention to local drug enforcement. A currently favored local-enforcement strategy, "crackdowns," increases police activity in an area to increase the perceived and/or actual threat of apprehension <ref> [20] </ref>. The hope is that concentrating the resources in a geographic area will make them more effective. In effect, crackdowns are predicated on a belief in increasing returns to scale in enforcement.
