Abstract: General-to-specific learners like ID3 and CN2 perform well when the target concept descriptions are general, but often have difficulties when they are specific or mixed. This problem can be alleviated by combining them with a specific-to-general learning component, resulting in a two-way induction system. In this paper one design for such a component is proposed, as well as two methods for combining the two components. Experiments on artificial domains show the combined learner to match or outperform "pure" versions of C4.5 and CN2 across the entire generality spectrum, with the advantage increasing for greater concept specificity. Experiments on 24 real-world domains from the UCI repository confirm the utility of two-way induction: the combined learner achieves higher accuracy than C4.5 in 17 domains (at the 5% significance level in 12), and similar results are obtained with CN2. Closer observation of the system's behavior leads to a better understanding of its ability to correct overly-general rules with specific ones, and shows that there is still room for improvement.

Reference-contexts: A recent version of CN2 was used <ref> [3] </ref>. The default settings for C4.5, C4.5RULES and CN2 were kept. Note that all results for C4.5RULES (abbreviated C4.5R) and CN2 below are those obtained using their own classification procedures, not the one above for G rules.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Motivation Most widely-used decision-tree and rule learners perform general-to-specific induction: they start with an empty concept description, and gradually add restrictions to it until there is not enough evidence to continue, or perfect discrimination is achieved. ID3/C4.5 [14] and CN2 <ref> [4] </ref> are examples of systems that function in this way. They have some significant advantages: because only statistical measures are used to evaluate induction steps, as opposed to individual examples being considered, good noise immunity can be achieved.

Reference-contexts: The essential idea behind VDM-type metrics is that two values should be considered similar if they make similar class predictions, and dissimilar if their predictions diverge. This has been found to give good results in several domains <ref> [5] </ref>. Notice that, in particular, SV DM (x i ; x j ) is always 0 if i = j.

Reference-contexts: Specific-to-general induction is performed by systems like NGE [16] and KBNGE [19], but neither combines it with general-to-specific learning. Golding and Rosenbloom's Anapron system for name pronunciation <ref> [8] </ref> performs search in neither direction, but is similar in spirit to TWI: a set of expert-supplied rules 11 functions as the G component, and a set of implicit rules (the "arules") contained in a case base functions as the S component. 6 Conclusions and Future Work This paper has shown

Reference-contexts: Also, unlike version spaces, TWI is able to deal with disjunctive concepts, noise, and missing and continuous attributes.

Reference-contexts: since in TWI-2 the distinction between S and G rules is maintained, the G rules can be seen as an approximate and accessible model of the domain, while the S rules represent second-order refinements and exceptions that should be taken into account to achieve higher accuracy. 5 Related Work Mitchell's <ref> [10] </ref> version space approach is an early example of two-way induction. TWI is a heuristic algorithm, in contrast to Mitchell's exhaustive candidate elimination procedure, but has the advantage that its worst-case space and time complexities are respectively linear and low-order polynomial, instead of exponential.

Reference-contexts: the concept and 7 its negation have necessarily long rules, are for intermediate values of C. 4.2 Natural domains Whether the expected advantages of adding a specific-to-general component to a general-to-specific learner are realized in real-world applications was investigated by carrying out experiments on 24 domains from the UCI repository <ref> [11] </ref>. Again, 20 runs were conducted for each dataset, with two-thirds of the data used for training. The default classifier (assigning examples to the most frequent class) was included as a baseline.

Reference-contexts: When two or more rules are equally close to a test example, the rule that was most accurate on the training set wins.

Reference-contexts: They have other disadvantages, however: search has to start from specific examples, making it more sensitive to noise, and early decisions, based on little evidence, can be wrong and difficult to correct later on. As a result, even though some specific-to-general learners exist (e.g., EACH <ref> [16] </ref>), they have not come into widespread use. <p> The post-pruning step used in many rule and decision-tree learners can be seen as a form of specific-to-general induction, and Quinlan [13] and others have shown it to be effective.
