Reference-contexts: The variation of orientation over the whole map is shown in an angle map in Fig. 3, where the preferred orientation of each cell is given by a circular color code. As in orientation maps obtained by optical imaging methods in the cat (Bonhoeffer et al., 1991) or monkey <ref> (Blasdel and Salama, 1986) </ref>, we find a patchy arrangement of different preferred orientations and also pinwheel-like singularities.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Topographic maps are an ubiquitous pattern of organization in the brain. Among the most intensely investigated such patterns are orientation maps and ocular dominance maps in the visual cortex. Various models have been formulated which generate topographic maps as a consequence of activity driven self-organization processes <ref> (see Erwin et al., 1995, Swindale, 1996, for two recent reviews) </ref>. The simulated maps coincide with observed maps in many aspects. Yet distinctive differences remain, between simulated and observed maps as well as between simulated maps from different modeling frameworks. <p> For the combined maps we identified a parameter regime in which ocular dominance and orientation structure stably coexist. In the correlation-based framework, combined maps were numerically found to exist <ref> (Erwin and Miller, 1995) </ref>, but the mathematical underpinnings were judged controversely (Piepenbrock et al., 1996, 1997).

Reference-contexts: A third, rather widely applied framework for map development is Kohonen's 3 Self-Organizing Map algorithm (SOM). SOM-based models have sucessfully accounted for various aspects of visual (Obermayer et al., 1990, 1992, Good-hill, 1993, Wolf et al., 1994, 1996, Bauer et al., 1997), auditory <ref> (Martinetz et al., 1988) </ref> and somatosensory (Ritter and Schulten, 1986, Andres et al., 1994) map formation. Yet, in simulations of SOM-based models for ON-center and OFF-center-cell competition, a break of rotational symmetry has not been observed so far, despite a long-lasting search in several groups.

Reference-contexts: A few years ago, two map formation models have been presented which generate oriented receptive fields from a competition of ON-center and OFF-center cell responses in the LGN <ref> (Miller, 1992, 1994, Miyashita and Tanaka, 1992) </ref>. These models elegantly explain how orientation-selective simple cell responses could be due to a self-organization process which is driven by non-patterned input activity and could take place even before birth. <p> A break of isotropy has already been observed in other frameworks for map development models <ref> (Miyashita et al., 1992, Miller, 1992, 1994) </ref>. The results we describe here for the SOM-framework close a somewhat puzzling gap in the qualitative behaviour of these different frameworks, reducing the relative importance of the specific mathematical formalisations, and increasing the importance of common mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: In this letter we finally report that also SOMs can break rotational symmetry, albeit in a quite small regime of parameters. Using a recently described analysis technique <ref> (Riesenhuber et al., 1996, Bauer et al., 1997) </ref>, we first mathematically analyze the pattern formation behaviour of the corresponding SOM-model. After a short introduction to the SOM in the second section, analytical results are described in the third section.

Reference-contexts: It has been hypothesized that the phase angle is also arranged in a topographic fashion in the primary visual cortex, with a topology of the combined orientation and phase stimulus space equivalent to that of a Klein 10 bottle <ref> (Tanaka, 1995) </ref>. In our simulated maps we find the phase angle to vary indeed in a smooth way in many areas of the map (see arrows in Fig. 3).
