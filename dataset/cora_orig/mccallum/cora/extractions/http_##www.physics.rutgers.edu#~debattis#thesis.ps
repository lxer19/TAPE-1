Reference-contexts: Some 20% of edge-on galaxies are peanut shaped (Shaw 1987 [114]), close enough to the fraction of barred galaxies to suggest that real SB galaxies experience this instability. Araki (1985) <ref> [1] </ref> showed that the vertical velocity dispersion, w , needs to satisfy w ~ &gt; 0:293 u for stability against buckling in an infinite, uniform, non-rotating sheet of stars. Merritt & Sellwood (1994) [80] derived a general criterion for this instability to develop in finite systems.

Reference-contexts: The technique they used, the Tremaine-Weinberg method (Tremaine & Weinberg 1984 [121]), is one we are attempting to use for NGC 7079. It is described in Chapter 5. Indirect estimates of D L =a B can be obtained by matching hydrodynam-ical simulations with observations; Athanassoula's (1992) <ref> [2] </ref> comparison of shocks in 2-D gas flows with the locations and shapes of dust lanes in barred galaxies led her to suggest that D L =a B = 1:2 0:2. <p> In practice, both mechanisms must be inextricably linked. On-going infall makes it hardly surprising that warps are detected in most disks. 91 Chapter 5 OBSERVATIONS OF NGC 7079 5.1 Tremaine-Weinberg Method Evidence that bars are fast comes mostly from the hydrodynamics of gas in the bar region (Athanassoula 1992 <ref> [2] </ref>, Lindblad et al. 1996 [68], Weiner 1996 [133]). While this evidence is important, it has two significant limitations. The first is that gas needs to be present for the measurement to be possible. Thus, the pattern speeds of SB0 galaxies cannot be measured by this method.

Reference-contexts: Our realistic simulations, and those of Athanassoula (1996) <ref> [3] </ref>, have confirmed that self-consistent bars are rapidly braked by a massive responsive halo. Dynamical friction between a bar and a halo, therefore, allowed us to introduce a new argument, quite separate from rotation curve fitting, to bear on the question of the DM content of disk galaxies. <p> This result has already been noted by Athanassoula (1996) <ref> [3] </ref>. 48 The solid line shows the original distribution of run 4, while the dot-dashed, dashed and dotted lines are for halo angular momentum of 33%; 67% and 98% of the maximum possible, respectively. <p> In all cases, we arrive at the same conclusion: increasing L z;h =L z;max decreases the slowdown rate. Similar behavior has already been seen by Athanassoula (1996) <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.9 Conclusion We have argued that the absence of slow bars in HSB galaxies indicates that DM should not have a high central density. We find that dynamical friction is unacceptably strong 77 when the rotation curve is dark matter halo dominated.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, few galaxies manifest a feature in the shape of the rotation curve to mark the radius at which the dominant contribution to the central attraction switches from luminous to dark matter (Bahcall & Casertano 1985 <ref> [4] </ref>). <p> the maximum disk hypothesis is that, if the rotation curve is flat and the outer regions are clearly DM dominated, then in some not fully understood way the inner disk-dominated region must arrange itself to have the same rotational velocity as that from the outer halo (Bahcall & Casertano 1985 <ref> [4] </ref>). This problem is known as the "disk-halo conspiracy". (This disk-halo conspiracy might not be perfect; e.g. Casertano & van Gorkom 1991 [23] seem to find declining rotation curves in some galaxies.) It might be explained by dissipative processes in the galaxy formation process.

Reference-contexts: The dot-dash line indicates the cross-section of the layer of massless particles. By this time, the inner disk has tilted ~ 10 ffi away from its original plane, which was horizontal. (Barnes & Efstathiou 1987 <ref> [5] </ref>; Steinmetz & Bartelmann 1995 [117]). We work in units where G = M (= M disk + M halo ) = R d = 1; the unit of time is therefore (R 3 d =GM ) 1=2 . <p> Cosmological numerical simulations obtain similar results; (e.g. Barnes and Efstathiou, 1987 <ref> [5] </ref>, found median ~ 0:05). Our method for generating angular momentum will happily give any value of up to the maximum possible. When interpreting results of simulations with halo angular momentum, the underlying distribution of needs to be taken into account. 113

Reference-contexts: The sky was sampled in the left half only and the biweight of values at fixed radius was obtained, so that cosmic rays and stars did not contribute to the sky level. The biweight is a robust statistic, which is insensitive to outliers (Beers et al. 1990 <ref> [6] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Nelson & Tremaine (1996) [85], pursuing an idea originally proposed by Bertin & Mark (1980) <ref> [7] </ref>, found that warps can be excited by dynamical friction with either a counter-rotating halo or a prolate halo with the disk perpendicular to the halo major-axis. This prediction has been verified in N -body simulations by Dubinski & Nelson (1998) [33].

Reference-contexts: Finally, a set of slit velocity data exists in the literature (Kormendy 1983 [61]). In the future, we will be able to improve our comparisons by using our full two dimensional velocity map of NGC 7079 (work in progress, see x5.1) and the data of Bettoni & Galletta (1997) <ref> [8] </ref> for 13 SB0 galaxies. In this comparison, we used a B as unit of length. Kormedy cites a B = 51 00 for NGC 936, and his slits extended to 1:8a B . <p> This background will have to be subtracted; the procedure for doing this is discussed in x5.2.1. NGC 7079 is the brightest member of a group containing seven galaxies (Garcia 1993 [38]). NGC 7079 is included in the survey of barred galaxies of Bettoni & Galletta 1996 <ref> [8] </ref>. These authors obtained slit spectra passing through the center NGC 7079. From these data, they found a rotation amplitude of ~ 260 km s 1 . <p> The uncertainties in these parameters were calculated with both a jack-knife and a boot-strap resampling algorithm. We found " = 0:362 +0:004 0:005 (80% interval) corresponding to an inclination i = 50:3 +0:3 0:4 degrees, in good agreement with the result of Bettoni & Galletta (1996) <ref> [8] </ref>, who found i = 51 ffi . (We use the convention that i = 0 when the galaxy is face on.) The PA of the disk is 78:9 +0:3 0:2 degrees (80% interval). 5.3 Future Work What remains to be done is to obtain line profiles from the RFP images.

Reference-contexts: If warps are long-lived, therefore, some means to overcome differential precession is required (see reviews by Toomre 1983 [119] and Binney 1992 <ref> [9] </ref>). Hunter & Toomre (1969, hereafter HT69) [47] in a comprehensive study of cold, zero-thickness disks, addressed Lynden-Bell's (1965) [71] suggestion that warps could 79 be global modes of oscillation of the disk. <p> Sparke & Casertano (1988) [115] and Kuijken (1991) [62] found realistic warp modes inside such halos. These calculations, however, assumed a rigid halo; angular momentum conservation requires that there be a back reaction on the halo (Toomre 1983 [119]; Binney 1992 <ref> [9] </ref>). N -body simulations by Dubinski & Kuijken (1995) [32] and analytic calculations by Nelson & Tremaine (1995) [84] showed that a mobile halo should cause a warped disk to flatten quickly (but see also Binney et al. 1998 [11]).

Reference-contexts: There is also some disagreement over the precise size (Weinberg 1992 [131]; Dwek et al. 1995 [34]) and rotational frequency of the bar (Binney et al. 1991 <ref> [10] </ref>; Kalnajs 1996 [56]). 1.3 Bar Formation Ostriker & Peebles (1973) [91] argued that the fierce bar instability in disks could be avoided if disks were immersed in halos of equal or greater mass.

Reference-contexts: We present an outline of bar dynamics, particularly the instability that leads to bars. Further details can be found in the review article of Sellwood & Wilkinson (1993) [113] and in Binney & Tremaine (1987) <ref> [12] </ref>. Although bars are strongly triaxial systems, a lot can be learned from assuming a weak bar in an otherwise axisymmetric disk. We can then use the epicyclic approximation, which assumes small perturbations to a circular orbit. <p> This fluid is collisionless; an estimate of how long it takes the discrete mass distribution to scatter a particle by an amount V ? ~ V shows that the number of system crossings, n, required is n ~ N= ln N (see <ref> [12] </ref>). Thus a system of 10 11 stars requires n ~ 10 9 crossings to relax. <p> The uncertainty in D L was obtained directly from the uncertainty in p . We emphasize that it was the Lagrange point along the bar major axis (L1; see Binney and Tremaine 1987 <ref> [12] </ref> pg. 137) that we measured. What we have not done is to take the point where the axisymmetric part of the rotation curve intersects R p . <p> If a twisted disk were modelled as a set of uncoupled tilted rings in a flattened potential, their precession rates would vary across the disk leading to a winding problem, similar to that for spirals (e.g., Binney & Tremaine 1987 <ref> [12] </ref>). If warps are long-lived, therefore, some means to overcome differential precession is required (see reviews by Toomre 1983 [119] and Binney 1992 [9]). <p> The torque from the inner disk causes the outer disk to precess clockwise in Figure 4.4, counter to the disk rotation (Binney & Tremaine 1987 <ref> [12] </ref>) at a rate which decreases with radius, producing the leading spiral. The extremely slow precession rate of the outermost edge of the disk indicates that it is subject to a very mild torque, arising almost exclusively from the distant, tipped inner disk. <p> The latter generally has to be determined numerically. For a sphere with f (E; L) N sphere (E; L) = 8 2 Lf (E; L)t (E; L); (B2) (Binney & Tremaine 1987 <ref> [12] </ref>, problem 4-22), while, for a spheroid with f (E; J z ), N spheroid (E; J z ) = 4 2 f (E; J z )S (E; J z ) (B3) 108 (Sellwood & Valluri 1997 [112]). <p> In this last formula, S (E; J z ) is the cross-sectional area in (R; z) of the bounding torus in the meridional plane (Binney & Tremaine 1987, x3.2.1 <ref> [12] </ref>) and is easily evaluated numerically for arbitrary potentials. We next try to make a smooth selection of points in the sub-space of the integrals such that the density of points in small volume elements accurately reflects the value of the DF.

Reference-contexts: The generalization to y and z derivatives is trivial. This 17 force is calculated at grid points. The force at the position of particles is needed. We used the cloud-in-cell (CIC) interpolation scheme (Birdsall & Fuss 1969 <ref> [13] </ref>), which linearly interpolates the force on a point particle from the forces at the nearest 8 grid points. The CIC scheme was also used to assign the mass of each particle to the grid, which makes the interpolations momentum-conserving. <p> Cubic grid cells were employed, to avoid large artificial anisotropic forces. The code assigns a particle's mass to the grid for calculation of the potential, and the acceleration acting on it is calculated, using the momentum conserving, linear cloud-in-cell scheme of Birdsall & Fuss (1969) <ref> [13] </ref>. A second-order, time-centered leap-frog integrator was used. 3.3 Measurement Methods In this section we discuss some of the techniques used to measure quantities of interest. We needed to be able to measure the semi-major axis of the bar a B and its Lagrange point, D L .

Reference-contexts: The failure of disk galaxy rotation curves to decline significantly at large radii (e.g., Rubin et al. 1980 [99]; Bosma 1981 <ref> [14] </ref>) is usually interpreted as evidence that the luminous disk is embedded within a more extensive halo of dark matter (DM). Decomposition of rotation curves into separate contributions from luminous and dark matter is an issue of some controversy for HSB galaxies, however.

Reference-contexts: Seen from the side (edge-on in astronomical parlance), the outer part of the disk is often raised relative to the mid-plane of the inner disk on one side, while the opposite side is lowered. Such configurations, which resemble integral signs when seen edge-on, are known as warps. Bosma (1991) <ref> [15] </ref> found 12 warped disks in a sample of 20 edge-on systems. Since not 12 On the left is shown a typical annular segment of a warped disk; in this figure, we assume that the inner disk (not shown) is in the (x; y) plane. <p> Bosma (1991) <ref> [15] </ref> found 12 clearly warped disks in a sample of 20 edge-on systems; taking into account random warp orientation, the true fraction of warped disks must be larger. This high fraction of warped galaxies implies either that warps are long lived features or that they are repeatedly regenerated.

Reference-contexts: This assumption seems to be supported by the observational evidence, namely that the outer rotation curves of SB galaxies are not systematically different from those of SA galaxies (Bosma 1996 <ref> [16] </ref>). From this assumption it follows that there must be galaxies intermediate in dark matter content between maximum disk, fast bar SB galaxies and massive halo SA galaxies.

Reference-contexts: Galaxies which satisfy Freeman's law are now called high surface brightness (HSB) galaxies, while galaxies with fainter surface brightness are known as low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies (see Bothun, Impey & McGaugh 1997 <ref> [17] </ref> for a review). The existence of LSB galaxies has only recently been appreciated. <p> So far we have limited our attention to HSB galaxies. Low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies (Bothun et al. 1997 <ref> [17] </ref>), however, are known to be dark matter dominated. Bars in these systems are less common, but not unknown. We predict that bars in LSB galaxies, or any other halo dominated disk, will be slow.

By studying the Tip-LON diagrams of the HI layers of 12 warped galaxies, Briggs 13 (1990) <ref> [18] </ref> was able to characterize their behavior as (1) coplanar inside the 25 mag arcsec 2 isophotal radius, (2) changing near the 26.5 mag arcsec 2 isophotal radius (3) into a line of nodes (LON) on a leading spiral relative to the rotation in the inner disk.

Reference-contexts: The controversy has arisen because this procedure is very poorly constrained. M=L values of the luminous matter are uncertain and the fitted functional form for the halo is generally chosen arbitrarily (e.g., Broeils 1992 <ref> [19] </ref>). Moreover, few galaxies manifest a feature in the shape of the rotation curve to mark the radius at which the dominant contribution to the central attraction switches from luminous to dark matter (Bahcall & Casertano 1985 [4]).

Reference-contexts: Maximum disks are motivated by the 3 fact that luminous matter alone generally accounts well for overall shapes of rotation curves in the inner parts of bright galaxies (Kalnajs 1983 [55]; Kent 1986 [57]; Buchhorn 1992 <ref> [20] </ref>; Palunas 1996 [92]). Determining whether HSB galaxies are maximum disks will provide an important constraint on cosmological models.

Reference-contexts: intermediate surface brightness. 78 Chapter 4 WARPED GALAXIES FROM MISALIGNED ANGULAR MOMENTA 4.1 Introduction A characteristic "integral sign" twist has been observed in the disks of many galaxies; e.g. all three bright galaxies of the Local Group (the Milky Way, M31 and M33) are warped in this manner (Burke 1957 <ref> [21] </ref>; Newton & Emerson 1977 [86]; Rogstad et al. 1976 [98]). The warp is usually most prominent in the extended HI disk, but can also be seen in the star light (Reshetnikov & Combes 1998 [96]).

Reference-contexts: At later stages in the disk's evolution, the spiral structure often becomes frozen into a ring around the bar. One of these rings can be seen in Figure 3.4. These rings seem to be of the kind that Buta (1995) <ref> [22] </ref>, and others, have called inner rings, as suggested by their position (just outside the bar) and orientation (usually aligned with the bar). An example of one of these rings can be seen in Figure 3.7. <p> The galaxies chosen for observation were selected from a variety of catalogues, most notably Buta's (1995) <ref> [22] </ref> Catalog of Southern Ringed Galaxies. Objects were first selected by Hubble type (SB0 with various ring features) and favorable placement on the nights of our run. Images of the galaxies that made this first cut were then extracted from the Digitized Sky Survey 2 .

(This disk-halo conspiracy might not be perfect; e.g. Casertano & van Gorkom 1991 <ref> [23] </ref> seem to find declining rotation curves in some galaxies.) It might be explained by dissipative processes in the galaxy formation process.

The gravitational back reaction from this trailing wake, which slows down the massive object, is known as dynamical friction. Chandrasekhar (1943) <ref> [24] </ref> showed that a mass M moving through an infinite, homogeneous medium at velocity v suffers a retarding force: F = v 2 ln fl (&lt; v) (1.4) where (&lt; v) is the density of background objects with speeds less than v, fl is the ratio of maximum to minimum impact

Reference-contexts: The way to ensure that an ILR is always present is to give the galaxy a very rapidly rising rotation curve; then for all plausible values of p , an ILR will be present and the resonant cavity does not function. 1.4 The Buckling Instability Combes et al. 1990 <ref> [25] </ref> reported a thickening of their bars, which they attributed to a family of vertically unstable stellar orbits. It was Raha et al. 1991 [95] who identified a similar thickening in their N -body bars as resulting from a buckling instability of the bar. <p> Until recently, these predictions had not been thoroughly tested. Sellwood (1980) [102] reported a secular gain of angular momentum by the halo in a low-quality simulation of a barred galaxy. Simulations by Combes et al. (1990) <ref> [25] </ref> had only a bulge of live particles, not an extensive halo; Raha et al. (1991) [95] did not evolve their models for long enough; the "halo" particles employed by Little & Carlberg (1991) [69] were confined to a plane, and the bar used by Hernquist & Weinberg (1992) [44] was

This ratio is found to be not much larger for the bars that form in most N -body simulations of bar unstable disks (e.g., Sellwood 1981 [103]; Combes & Sanders 1981 <ref> [26] </ref>). Bars with D L =a B substantially larger than 1 are called slow bars. The observational evidence for fast bars is somewhat more limited. The determination of D L =a B for galaxies ideally requires a direct measurement of the bar pattern speed, p .
Reference: [27] <author> Contopoulos, G. </author> <year> 1980, </year> <title> A & A, </title> <type> 81, 198 </type>
Reference-contexts: Because it is dimensionless, D L =a B is a distance-independent quantity. Since theory predicts that bars form in resonant cavities between the galaxy center and the corotation radius, it is likely that when a bar forms, it ends near its Lagrange point. Contopolous (1980) <ref> [27] </ref> suggested that self-consistent bars cannot extend beyond their Lagrange points, i.e. D L =a B 1. This ratio is found to be not much larger for the bars that form in most N -body simulations of bar unstable disks (e.g., Sellwood 1981 [103]; Combes & Sanders 1981 [26]).

That simulation was presented in Debattista & Sellwood (1998) <ref> [28] </ref>; here, for consistency, we discuss only the cartesian version of this simulation. 62 The solid line shows the contribution from the disk in both runs. <p> Debattista & Sellwood 1998 <ref> [28] </ref>).

N -body simulations by Dubinski & Kuijken (1995) <ref> [32] </ref> and analytic calculations by Nelson & Tremaine (1995) [84] showed that a mobile halo should cause a warped disk to flatten quickly (but see also Binney et al. 1998 [11]).

The old idea that the warp of the Milky Way is excited by the tidal field of the Large Magellanic Cloud has been revived by Weinberg (1995) [132], who argued that its feeble tidal field is amplified by the halo's response.

Reference-contexts: Eventually the leading wave unwinds and the process is repeated. The resonant cavity is missing one vital ingredient before it can generate bars. Very strong amplification occurs when a leading wave unwinds into a trailing wave. This amplification is known as swing amplification (Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965 <ref> [41] </ref>; Julian & Toomre 1966 [52]); as the leading spiral unwinds, there is a temporary near-match between the epicyclic motion of stars, and the rotating spiral. The effect of this is to enhance the mutual gravitational force between the spiral and the stars, which amplifies the spiral.

Reference-contexts: This potential is non-singular, going to a finite value as r goes to zero. Gravity is an inverse square force; the gravitational field at a point is therefore determined by the large-scale matter distribution.

Reference-contexts: Visual inspections of the bar did not suggest that the bar was too strong (see Figure 3.28 for example); we speculate that the discrepancy between our "maximum disk" model and NGC 936 comes from the the absence of a significant bulge-like sub-system in our model. Kent and Glaudell (1989) <ref> [59] </ref> fit a three component model for the photometry of NGC 936. <p> A bulge component inside the inner Lindblad resonance might act as the source of angular momentum for the bar. Bulges can contain a substantial mass in the inner region of the galaxy (e.g., NGC 936, Kent & Glaudell 1989 <ref> [59] </ref>) and are often in rapid rotation. Nevertheless, the fact that bulges are concentrated at such small radius, particularly in early type galaxies, limits the amount of angular momentum that they can contain.

This issue can only be reliably settled with more observations. Another possibility for avoiding this conclusion, the destruction of bars as a result of the slowdown (e.g. Kormendy 1979 <ref> [60] </ref>), is also not likely, in the absence of other processes. Our bars had no problem surviving the substantial slowdown they experienced. Other processes, not included in our simulations, can destroy bars.

While this evidence is important, it has two significant limitations. The first is that gas needs to be present for the measurement to be possible. Thus, the pattern speeds of SB0 galaxies cannot be measured by this method.

Reference-contexts: Simulations by Combes et al. (1990) [25] had only a bulge of live particles, not an extensive halo; Raha et al.

Our realistic simulations, and those of Athanassoula (1996) [3], have confirmed that self-consistent bars are rapidly braked by a massive responsive halo.

Reference-contexts: Thus, arbitrary functions odd in J z can be added to the DF without changing . Thus particle velocities tangential to the symmetry axis z can be reversed at random without effecting the equilibrium of the system (Lynden-Bell 1962 <ref> [70] </ref>). Halos with non-zero total angular momentum, L z;h , therefore can be generated by merely flipping halo particle angular momenta until the required total angular momentum is obtained. The angular momentum-flipping scheme which we implemented is both efficient and can handle the full range of L z;h .

Such bars have been seen before in N -body simulations (James & Sellwood 1978 [50]). 44 3.4.3 Exploring the disk parameter space Run 4 started out with a very cool disk having Q = 0:05. <p> Thus, it should not be surprising that we found fast bars can persist in maximum disks. The failure of p to reach zero 75 can be understood in Lynden-Bell's (1979) <ref> [72] </ref> picture of orbit trapping by the bar. In particular, we find that, in settled systems, the wake excited in the halo by the bar usually lines up either along the bar or perpendicular to the bar. We have shown many plots of the evolution of p .

Reference-contexts: In the long run, the density distribution in the halo must become symmetric about 81 the disk plane, even while it continues to rotate about a misaligned axis. Simple time-reversibility arguments dictate that a steady system cannot support net torques (cf. the "anti-spiral" theorem, Lynden-Bell & Ostriker 1967 <ref> [73] </ref>; Kalnajs 1971 [53]). We therefore find the dynamical friction torque on the disk does not persist indefinitely.

Reference-contexts: In this case, one end of the galaxy is systematically torqued by the other end. The effect of this artificial anisotropy is that a warped disk on the cartesian grid will tend to settle to one of the symmetry planes of the grid (May & James 1984, <ref> [75] </ref>). This code is therefore not suited to studying warped galaxies. The cartesian 3D code with the leapfrog integrator has been tested extensively. Sellwood & Merritt (1994) [109] showed that it was able to reproduce Vandervoort's (1991) [126] analytic prediction for the behavior of non-rotating oblate spheroids of uniform density. <p> as a serious objection to our model, since late infalling material must constantly revise the net angular momentum of the halo. 4.3 Numerical Method Since mild force anisotropies in many grid-based N -body methods can cause an isolated disk to settle to a preferred plane (e.g., May & James 1984 <ref> [75] </ref>), we have chosen a code with no preferred plane.

Reference-contexts: The tight-winding approximation fails at an ILR; detailed analysis reveals that an ILR reflects a leading spiral (under appropriate conditions) into a trailing spiral (Goldreich & Tremaine 1979 [42]), while a trailing spiral is absorbed by the ILR (Mark 1974 <ref> [76] </ref>). In the absence of an ILR, a inward-travelling, trailing spiral wave reaches all the way to the center and emerges as an outward-travelling leading wave. Thus a resonant cavity can be set up when no ILR is present.

Reference-contexts: Various strategies have been employed in the past to deal with these two problems. One solution is to introduce a softening parameter into the expressions for the potential (Villumsen 1982 [128]; White 1983 [129]; McGlynn 1984 <ref> [77] </ref>). An alternative strategy is to introduce a grid in all three coordinates (van Albada 1982 [122]). Here we adopt an intermediate approach. We introduce a 1-D radial mesh on which the coefficients A lm and B lm are tabulated, but retain the exact angular dependence. <p> The center of mass of the system is not a suitable center for our purposes because it weights distant particles higher, while the bar will be concentrated at the center. A more suitable approach, which we have adopted, follows McGlynn (1984) 26 <ref> [77] </ref>, who defined the function: !(x 0 ; y 0 ; z 0 ) = n where (x n ; y n ; z n ) are the cartesian coordinates of the nth particle and (x 0 ; y 0 ; z 0 ) those of an expansion center. <p> N -body codes based on an expansion of the potential in spherical harmonics have been widely used in the past in both gridless form (Villumsen 1982 [128], White 1983 [129], McGlynn 1984 <ref> [77] </ref>) and using a full 3-D grid (van Albada 1982 [122]). Here we adopt an intermediate approach: we tabulate coefficients of a spherical harmonic expansion of the density distribution on a radial grid, and interpolate for the gravitational forces between the values on these shells.

Reference-contexts: However, our position in the MWG complicates measurement of the scale-length, rotation curve and distance to the Galactic Center. Thus, the contribution of DM to the circular velocity at the Solar position is still a matter of debate (Merrifield 1993 <ref> [78] </ref>; Sellwood & Sanders 1988 [111]; Sackett 1997 [100]). Both maximum disk models and sub-maximal disks are consistent, within the 5 errors, with these measurements. De Vaucouleurs suggested that the MWG was barred as early as 1964 [31].

Reference-contexts: Bars with D L =a B substantially larger than 1 are called slow bars. The observational evidence for fast bars is somewhat more limited.

Reference-contexts: 4 WARPED GALAXIES FROM MISALIGNED ANGULAR MOMENTA 4.1 Introduction A characteristic "integral sign" twist has been observed in the disks of many galaxies; e.g. all three bright galaxies of the Local Group (the Milky Way, M31 and M33) are warped in this manner (Burke 1957 [21]; Newton & Emerson 1977 <ref> [86] </ref>; Rogstad et al. 1976 [98]). The warp is usually most prominent in the extended HI disk, but can also be seen in the star light (Reshetnikov & Combes 1998 [96]).

Reference-contexts: Suppose SA galaxies really are stabilized by very massive halos. Stabilization means that infinitesimal perturbations cannot grow to the point where they lead to a bar. But finite perturbations can lead to bars even in such galaxies. Noguchi (1987) <ref> [87] </ref> showed that bars can be triggered by tidal interactions, as when, for example, a companion galaxy passes through perigalacticon. Such barred galaxies would eventually have to slow down due to dynamical friction.

Reference-contexts: Our bars had no problem surviving the substantial slowdown they experienced. Other processes, not included in our simulations, can destroy bars. Bars can be destroyed, for example, by the accumulation of a relatively modest amount of mass at the galaxy center (e.g. Norman et al. 1996 <ref> [88] </ref>). (Satellite impacts can also destroy 72 bars, but this mechanism does not discriminate slow from fast bars.) Our simulations were purely collisionless and, therefore, could not take into account such processes. <p> Gas inflows in barred galaxies involve a transfer of angular momentum from the gas to the bar. The amount of gas mass that can be accumulated, however, is very low, on order 5% or less (Norman et al. 1996 <ref> [88] </ref>) before the bar is destroyed by the increased central concentration; our canonical simulation was able to transfer ~ 40% of the disk's angular momentum. Gas cannot provide this large quantity of angular momentum to the bar without destroying it.

Reference-contexts: Ostriker & Binney (1989) <ref> [90] </ref> pointed out that warps respresent a misalignment of the angular momentum within the disk. <p> Huang & Carlberg (1997) [45] noted that a satellite falling onto a disk can excite a warp by differential tilting and showed that the slight warp generated this way could survive for a long time after the satellite had been cannibalized.

The dynamics by which this misalignment arise have not been fully understood. Satellites might be able to provide the torque needed to generate warps, but not all warped galaxies have satellites.

Reference-contexts: There is also some disagreement over the precise size (Weinberg 1992 [131]; Dwek et al. 1995 [34]) and rotational frequency of the bar (Binney et al. 1991 [10]; Kalnajs 1996 [56]). 1.3 Bar Formation Ostriker & Peebles (1973) <ref> [91] </ref> argued that the fierce bar instability in disks could be avoided if disks were immersed in halos of equal or greater mass. <p> Having exhausted all possible means for maintaining fast bars in sub-maximal disks that we could think of, the only possibility that seems to remain is for the fast bars of HSB disks to be in maximum disks. Ostriker & Peebles (1973) <ref> [91] </ref> showed that bars are suppressed in systems which are substantially dark matter dominated. Thus, "maximum disks in barred galaxies" would seem to be a fairly uncontroversial statement. <p> We conclude, therefore, that all HSB disk galaxies, barred or unbarred, are maximum disks. This statement is controversial. Unfortunately, the result of Ostriker & Peebles (1973) <ref> [91] </ref> is often understood the wrong way round, i.e. that the absence of a bar in some disk implies the presence of a substantial halo.

Reference-contexts: The general shape of rotation curves is a rise from the center followed by a more or less constant circular velocity (in HSB galaxies) out to the last measured point. The failure of disk galaxy rotation curves to decline significantly at large radii (e.g., Rubin et al. 1980 <ref> [99] </ref>; Bosma 1981 [14]) is usually interpreted as evidence that the luminous disk is embedded within a more extensive halo of dark matter (DM). Decomposition of rotation curves into separate contributions from luminous and dark matter is an issue of some controversy for HSB galaxies, however.

Thus, the contribution of DM to the circular velocity at the Solar position is still a matter of debate (Merrifield 1993 [78]; Sellwood & Sanders 1988 [111]; Sackett 1997 <ref> [100] </ref>). Both maximum disk models and sub-maximal disks are consistent, within the 5 errors, with these measurements. De Vaucouleurs suggested that the MWG was barred as early as 1964 [31].

Reference-contexts: Turbulent viscosity coupled with star formation seems to be able to reproduce exponential disks with flat, maximum disk, rotation curves (Saio & Yoshii 1990 <ref> [101] </ref>; Firmani et al. 1996 [35]). More recently, Sellwood & Moore (1998) [110] simulated systems with rotation curves which sagged in between the inner disk dominated part and the outer fixed-halo dominated region.

Reference-contexts: The third, and more plausible way, is to introduce an ILR. When an ILR is present, trailing waves are absorbed at it, and the feedback loop from off the center is broken. Sellwood 8 (1980) <ref> [102] </ref> found that the bars that formed in his simulations had p that put them over the maximum value of 0 =2, i.e., they had no ILRs. <p> Weinberg explained that "[t]he reason for this increase is that prograde orbits have a stronger effect on the bar than retrograde orbits" [130]. Until recently, these predictions had not been thoroughly tested. Sellwood (1980) <ref> [102] </ref> reported a secular gain of angular momentum by the halo in a low-quality simulation of a barred galaxy.

Reference-contexts: Contopolous (1980) [27] suggested that self-consistent bars cannot extend beyond their Lagrange points, i.e. D L =a B 1. This ratio is found to be not much larger for the bars that form in most N -body simulations of bar unstable disks (e.g., Sellwood 1981 <ref> [103] </ref>; Combes & Sanders 1981 [26]). Bars with D L =a B substantially larger than 1 are called slow bars. The observational evidence for fast bars is somewhat more limited.

Reference-contexts: These are purely numerical effects; the analytic, smooth density distribution would still be bar unstable. The growth-rates of the N -body bars will approach that of the analytic distribution with increasing number of particles (Sellwood 1983 <ref> [104] </ref>). The next important check, therefore, is the behavior as a function of the number of particles. Two further simulations, run 14 with 5 times the number of particles (1:5M ) and run 17 with one fifth (60K), tested the dependence on particle number. <p> We next try to make a smooth selection of points in the sub-space of the integrals such that the density of points in small volume elements accurately reflects the value of the DF. The procedure, first described by Sellwood (1983) <ref> [104] </ref> and also explained by Press et al. (1992, xx7.6-7.8) [94], is to integrate the DF to obtain a mass function, and place abscissae at equal mass increments. This procedure yields deterministically distributed abscissae, spaced sparsely where the DF has low values and densely where it is large. <p> In general, random selection from the appropriate distribution is adequate, although it is easy to improve upon random when desired for a particular application. Two examples are: Sellwood (1983) <ref> [104] </ref> found it desirable to space several otherwise identical particles equally around a ring when searching for small-amplitude non-axisymmetric instabilities and Sellwood (1997) [106] was able to quieten radial pulsations of a stable spherical model by spacing particles equally in radial phase.

Reference-contexts: The lack of discrete modes implies that any twist would quickly disperse, a result which has often been cited to argue that warps cannot be global modes. This conclusion is not quite water-tight since neither of the above-cited results of HT69 holds in disks with random motion. Sellwood (1996) <ref> [105] </ref> reported a counter-example of a long-lived, discrete, m = 0, flapping mode in an N -body simulation of a thick, hot disk; this curious mode seems of doubtful relevance to real warps, however. Most recent ideas for warp formation rely in some way on the influence of the halo.

Reference-contexts: Since this is not the standard softening scheme, it is impossible to give an exact value of *. In standard softening, the maximum interparticle force occurs at *= p 2 whereas our code has maximum interparticle force at ' 1:5 grid units (Sellwood & Merritt 1994 [109]). Sellwood (1997) <ref> [106] </ref> found that the cost in cpu time of calculating the potential for one timestep is barely affected by the number of particles at small N , and has not reached O (N ) behavior at N = 8 million particles. <p> For this to be possible, the extent of the grid had to be increased to 257 3 , i.e. 8 times as many grid points as our canonical simulation. The cpu time for the cartesian code scales as O (N 1:2 g ) (Sellwood 1997 <ref> [106] </ref>) where N g is the number of grid points. Therefore these runs are much more expensive. <p> Two examples are: Sellwood (1983) [104] found it desirable to space several otherwise identical particles equally around a ring when searching for small-amplitude non-axisymmetric instabilities and Sellwood (1997) <ref> [106] </ref> was able to quieten radial pulsations of a stable spherical model by spacing particles equally in radial phase. In a razor-thin disk, or in a sphere, the orbit lies in a plane in which particles oscillate with full period t (E; L) between peri- and apocenters.

Reference-contexts: For a razor-thin disk, the density of particles having energy E and angular momentum J z is (Sellwood & Athanassoula 1986 <ref> [107] </ref>) N disk (E; J z ) = 2f (E; J z )t (E; J z ); (B1) where f is the usual phase space density and t (E; J z ) is the period of one complete radial oscillation of a particle with the given (E; J z ).

Reference-contexts: 2 crossings in a rotationally supported system, then collisional relaxation in a purely stellar system is an entirely negligible effect (massive objects such as giant molecular clouds lead to increased relaxation, but this is probably smaller than that due to collective behavior, such as spiral arms Sellwood & Carlberg 1984 <ref> [108] </ref>). The evolution of the distribution function is therefore given by the collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE), also known as the Vlasov equation: df @t where is the gravitational potential and r v is the gradient operator in velocity space.

Reference-contexts: In Fourier space, the Laplacian operator reduces to a multiplication; the Poisson and Laplace equations were therefore solved in Fourier space using a fast Fourier transform (FFT). James' algorithm is roughly three times faster than a mesh doubling technique (Sellwood & Merritt 1994 <ref> [109] </ref>). The use of an FFT requires that the mesh have dimensions l 1 fi l 2 fi l 3 such that l i = 2 j + 1 with j an integer. We used 129 3 and larger grids. <p> The forces obtained by the method are of high quality, with the force reaching its full Newtonian value at ~ 3 grid spaces (Sellwood & Merritt 1994 <ref> [109] </ref>). Note that gravity softened as in Equation 2.4 is never exactly the same as the Newtonian value, whereas here the Newtonian force is obtained at a finite distance.

The cartesian 3D code with the leapfrog integrator has been tested extensively. Sellwood & Merritt (1994) <ref> [109] </ref> showed that it was able to reproduce Vandervoort's (1991) [126] analytic prediction for the behavior of non-rotating oblate spheroids of uniform density. We have also run a system with a disk and halo in which the halo was very massive, such that a bar could not form. <p> The unit of time used was t = r d M d GM tot f d . The fixed time step chosen was 0:05 times this time unit. The simulations described here were performed on the 3D cartesian code described in Sellwood & Merritt (1994) <ref> [109] </ref> and reviewed in Chapter 2, which uses an efficient FFT-based Poisson solver. Cubic grid cells were employed, to avoid large artificial anisotropic forces.

Reference-contexts: This code is therefore ideal for studying isolated systems which furthermore must be integrated for long times. A 3D polar grid code discussed by Sellwood & Valluri (1997) <ref> [112] </ref> was also used for a few comparison simulations; this code is more expensive for equal N g . The polar code has the advantage of higher resolution along the symmetry axis, although this advantage can be diminished somewhat if the system center drifts due to mass loss. <p> Finally, we ran a crude test of the canonical simulation by running it on a polar 3D code. The polar code has been described in Sellwood & Valluri (1997) <ref> [112] </ref>. This test was run 11; it had a disk truncated at 10 R d but f d was not changed to compensate for this fact. <p> After some initial tests, we found that fi 0:2 gave rise to strong m = 1 modes in the halo which infected the disk. These m = 1 instabilities, which were, most likely, related to those discussed by Sellwood & Valluri (1997) <ref> [112] </ref> for counter-rotating oblate spheroids, were much larger than the more modest asymmetries seen in real galaxies and interfere considerably with the development of the bar. Here, therefore, we report on only those simulations in which the m = 1 moment saturated at very low levels. <p> A bar was seen to develop in the halo of run 54 which then co-rotates with the bar (Figure 3.19 (c)); this accounts for the reduced transfer of angular momentum. In their study of rapidly rotating, oblate Stackel form models, Sellwood and Valluri (1997) <ref> [112] </ref> found that models with b=a 0:5 were stable against bar formation. The presence of a bar in our rounder halo was therefore most likely a forced response from the bar in the disk, with halo orbits trapped into a bar by it. <p> Therefore these runs are much more expensive. Apart from the cartesian grid version of this simulation, we also ran a version of the "maximum disk" model on a polar grid (the polar grid code has been discussed by Sellwood & Valluri 1997 <ref> [112] </ref>). That simulation was presented in Debattista & Sellwood (1998) [28]; here, for consistency, we discuss only the cartesian version of this simulation. 62 The solid line shows the contribution from the disk in both runs. <p> = 8 2 Lf (E; L)t (E; L); (B2) (Binney & Tremaine 1987 [12], problem 4-22), while, for a spheroid with f (E; J z ), N spheroid (E; J z ) = 4 2 f (E; J z )S (E; J z ) (B3) 108 (Sellwood & Valluri 1997 <ref> [112] </ref>). In this last formula, S (E; J z ) is the cross-sectional area in (R; z) of the bounding torus in the meridional plane (Binney & Tremaine 1987, x3.2.1 [12]) and is easily evaluated numerically for arbitrary potentials.

Reference-contexts: The disk may exhibit various features, spirals being most typical, but also including bars in roughly 30% of all cases (Sellwood & Wilkinson 1993 <ref> [113] </ref>). A bar is an elongated concentration of stars sitting at the center of the galaxy. <p> Nevertheless, the dynamics of barred galaxies depends on the DM content, as we will show in x3. We present an outline of bar dynamics, particularly the instability that leads to bars. Further details can be found in the review article of Sellwood & Wilkinson (1993) <ref> [113] </ref> and in Binney & Tremaine (1987) [12]. Although bars are strongly triaxial systems, a lot can be learned from assuming a weak bar in an otherwise axisymmetric disk. We can then use the epicyclic approximation, which assumes small perturbations to a circular orbit. <p> However, a full 30% of all HSB disks are strongly barred (Sellwood & Wilkinson 1993 <ref> [113] </ref>), which is too large a fraction to be accounted for by the large value wing of the distribution. Conceivably, the smaller fraction of barred galaxies in which p has been measured fall in this wing.

Reference-contexts: This buckling instability, which is common in our simulations, gives rise to peanut shaped bars when seen edge-on (e.g. see Figure 3.4). Some 20% of edge-on galaxies are peanut shaped (Shaw 1987 <ref> [114] </ref>), close enough to the fraction of barred galaxies to suggest that real SB galaxies experience this instability. Araki (1985) [1] showed that the vertical velocity dispersion, w , needs to satisfy w ~ &gt; 0:293 u for stability against buckling in an infinite, uniform, non-rotating sheet of stars.

Reference-contexts: The dot-dash line indicates the cross-section of the layer of massless particles. By this time, the inner disk has tilted ~ 10 ffi away from its original plane, which was horizontal. (Barnes & Efstathiou 1987 [5]; Steinmetz & Bartelmann 1995 <ref> [117] </ref>). We work in units where G = M (= M disk + M halo ) = R d = 1; the unit of time is therefore (R 3 d =GM ) 1=2 . In these units, a rotation period in the disk plane at R d is 32. <p> The theoretical calculations in the linear perturbation theory of angular momentum growth by tidal torques of Steinmetz and Bartelmann (1995) <ref> [117] </ref> gave the result that 80% of halos are in the range 0:02 0:11, with very little dependence on or fluctuation spectrum. Cosmological numerical simulations obtain similar results; (e.g. Barnes and Efstathiou, 1987 [5], found median ~ 0:05).

Reference-contexts: Since bars grow in a resonant cavity of spiral density waves (Toomre 1981 <ref> [118] </ref>), we expect that destructive interference will not be as important as the resonant amplification. Thus, in general, we expect that particle noise will increase bar growth rates (because it provides more spiral seeding for the swing amplifier), but the growing bar will also be subject to more interference.

Reference-contexts: If warps are long-lived, therefore, some means to overcome differential precession is required (see reviews by Toomre 1983 <ref> [119] </ref> and Binney 1992 [9]). Hunter & Toomre (1969, hereafter HT69) [47] in a comprehensive study of cold, zero-thickness disks, addressed Lynden-Bell's (1965) [71] suggestion that warps could 79 be global modes of oscillation of the disk. <p> Most recent ideas for warp formation rely in some way on the influence of the halo.

Reference-contexts: However, there are problems in applying Chandrasekhar's equation 1.4; questionable approximations in this simple model include straight line orbits for the bar masses and an infinite, homogeneous medium to represent the halo. Tremaine & Weinberg (1984) <ref> [120] </ref> developed a formalism which generalized dynamical friction to spherical systems under the assumptions that the self-gravity of the response can be neglected and perturbation theory is valid. They showed that dynamical friction in spherical systems arises entirely from near resonant stars and identified two regimes with different qualitative behavior. <p> The reader might have noticed that a general trend exists: p first drops steeply, followed by either a more gentle fall or a levelling off to a constant value. We may, perhaps, identify these two regimes with the two regimes identified by Tremaine & Weinberg (1984) <ref> [120] </ref> (see x1.6). The identification of a steep drop of p with Tremaine & Weinberg's "rapidly" varying regime is tentative and difficult to verify without detailed dissection of our models. The identification of the "slowly" varying regime with the levelling off in p is based on better evidence.

It is described in Chapter 5. <p> While these models seem to be quite robust, a direct measurement of a few pattern speeds would increase confidence in these hydrodynamical models. A method to measure the pattern speed, p , directly has been worked out by Tremaine and Weinberg (1984) <ref> [121] </ref>. The Tremaine-Weinberg method requires a tracer population, the surface brightness of which satisfies the continuity equation. In galaxies with no extinction, such as SB0's, the Tremaine-Weinberg method will work well with star-light; galaxies of type SBa-SBc have too much obscuring dust for continuity to be satisfied.

Reference-contexts: Chandrasekhar's equation and a simple model of a barred galaxy consisting of two equal point masses at fixed separation rotating about a point half-way between them in an isothermal halo predicts that the bar will lose roughly half its angular momentum every rotation (e.g., Weinberg 1985 <ref> [130] </ref>). Such a huge slowdown would imply that all bars would have to be slow at the present time. <p> When p is changing "rapidly", a drag is exerted on the bar; in the regime where p is changing "slowly", feedback is present which can either stabilize or destabilize p , angular 11 momentum changes are reversible, and furthermore, stars can be trapped on resonant orbits. Weinberg (1985) <ref> [130] </ref> applied this formalism to a bar in a massive halo using as his perturbation parameter the ratio of bar mass to the mass of the unperturbed stellar sphere inside the bar radius. He found that a bar will be slowed down in a few rotation periods. <p> He found that a bar will be slowed down in a few rotation periods. He went on to study the effect of halo rotation and predicted that "the rate at which the bar loses angular momentum increases" <ref> [130] </ref> (i.e. the average torque increases) as the fraction of prograde halo particles is increased (italics by author). Weinberg explained that "[t]he reason for this increase is that prograde orbits have a stronger effect on the bar than retrograde orbits" [130]. Until recently, these predictions had not been thoroughly tested. <p> "the rate at which the bar loses angular momentum increases" <ref> [130] </ref> (i.e. the average torque increases) as the fraction of prograde halo particles is increased (italics by author). Weinberg explained that "[t]he reason for this increase is that prograde orbits have a stronger effect on the bar than retrograde orbits" [130]. Until recently, these predictions had not been thoroughly tested. Sellwood (1980) [102] reported a secular gain of angular momentum by the halo in a low-quality simulation of a barred galaxy. <p> Gas cannot provide this large quantity of angular momentum to the bar without destroying it. Furthermore, gas-poor SB0 galaxies, such as NGC 936, have no problem maintaining fast bars. A second source of angular momentum for the bar, suggested by Weinberg (1985) <ref> [130] </ref>, is the disk itself. Our experience has shown us that the bar loses angular momentum to the disk, not the other way round. A bulge component inside the inner Lindblad resonance might act as the source of angular momentum for the bar. <p> To date, we are aware of no reliable measurements of pattern speeds in LSB galaxies. 3.8.3 Comparison with predictions of the Tremaine-Weinberg theory We have not attempted to compare our results with the predictions of Weinberg (1985) <ref> [130] </ref> (see x1.6). No detailed results can be presented here, therefore. Nonetheless, some qualitative comments can be made. Our main result is that bars in maximum disks are not slowed too severely. <p> Another test of the theory is to compare Weinberg's (1985) <ref> [130] </ref> prediction for rotating halos: halos with larger L z;h =L z;max , all other things being identical, will slow down faster. (Note the prediction is not that bars with larger L z;h =L z;max end slower; such a prediction would clearly be refuted by our series of rotating halo simulations.) <p> Importantly, no convincingly slow bars have ever been found in high surface brightness galaxies. Thus, unless some observational bias is favoring fast bars, it seems that all bars are fast, although additional observational evidence would be welcome. Weinberg (1985) <ref> [130] </ref> predicted that bars in massive halos would be rapidly slowed down by dynamical friction. We tested Weinberg's prediction in self-consistent N -body simulations. We found that bars in halo dominated systems can remain fast only if the halo has substantial prograde rotation.

Reference-contexts: De Vaucouleurs suggested that the MWG was barred as early as 1964 [31]. Presently, evidence for a bar at the center of the MWG comes from a variety of sources (for a review see Kuijken 1996 [63]). There is also some disagreement over the precise size (Weinberg 1992 <ref> [131] </ref>; Dwek et al. 1995 [34]) and rotational frequency of the bar (Binney et al. 1991 [10]; Kalnajs 1996 [56]). 1.3 Bar Formation Ostriker & Peebles (1973) [91] argued that the fierce bar instability in disks could be avoided if disks were immersed in halos of equal or greater mass.

Reference-contexts: This prediction has been verified in N -body simulations by Dubinski & Nelson (1998) [33]. The old idea that the warp of the Milky Way is excited by the tidal field of the Large Magellanic Cloud has been revived by Weinberg (1995) <ref> [132] </ref>, who argued that its feeble tidal field is amplified by the halo's response.

Reference-contexts: Studies of specific galaxies (Lindblad et al. 1996 [68]; 10 Weiner et al. 1996 <ref> [133] </ref>; Weiner 1998 [134]), using potentials derived from the observed near infrared light distribution, yield similar values. While the evidence is meager, it does suggest that D L =a B ~ &lt; 1:5 for Hubble types SB0 through SBc. <p> On-going infall makes it hardly surprising that warps are detected in most disks. 91 Chapter 5 OBSERVATIONS OF NGC 7079 5.1 Tremaine-Weinberg Method Evidence that bars are fast comes mostly from the hydrodynamics of gas in the bar region (Athanassoula 1992 [2], Lindblad et al. 1996 [68], Weiner 1996 <ref> [133] </ref>). While this evidence is important, it has two significant limitations. The first is that gas needs to be present for the measurement to be possible. Thus, the pattern speeds of SB0 galaxies cannot be measured by this method.

Reference-contexts: The physical basis of the TFR, however, is very poorly understood; feedback is thought to play an important role, but understanding 4 the low scatter in it is difficult. An interesting property of LSB galaxies is that they satisfy the same TFR as HSB galaxies (Zwaan et al. <ref> [135] </ref>). Since LSB galaxies are DM dominated, and they satisfy the same TFR as HSB galaxies, this suggests that the rotational velocity being probed by the TFR comes from DM. It would then seem to suggest that HSB galaxies are also DM dominated.
