The constant regions therefore allow PCR amplification of the pool, in addition to the design of the specific selection experiment. <p> We performed a similar experiment which led to the discovery of a minimal RNA ligase motif (Landweber, unpubl.), and experiments in other laboratories have led to the discovery of many classes of novel nucleic acid catalysts, including DNA enzymes isolated from pools of single-stranded DNA <ref> [11] </ref>. Nucleic acid-based computers and selection both search through a test-tube of molecules representing some subset of "sequence space" to find a molecule or class of molecules which satisfies the requirements of a strict selective filter. <p> These parameters include the stringency of the selection, the amount of initial variation in the pool, the amount of variation introduced at each successive round of amplification, the choice of salt concentrations and buffers, and numerous considerations about the design of the pool for the individual experiment <ref> [11] </ref>. The RNA pools can be one of two types. The first is completely random; all bases have an approximately equal probability (i.e. 25% each A, C, G & U) in a region of defined length, such as 220 bases (Figure 3). <p> Doped pools are often used to select variants of existing ribozymes with improved efficiency or to obtain molecules that function with different substrates or in different conditions <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The functional molecules which survive a strict selective filter ultimately become the dominant species in the pool. Thus in vitro evolution reduces the pool complexity to one (or more) functional class (es) of sequences, much like searching for solutions to hard bio-computational problems <ref> [12] </ref>. The technique has quickly enjoyed popularity, mainly because of its power to examine in parallel billions of possible solutions to important biochemical problems such as catalysis or binding.

These are problems which have hitherto been treated theoretically by Eigen, Schuster, Kauffman and others (e.g. <ref> [14] </ref>); however in vitro selection now provides a means to test numerous predictions and also to refine the theory.
