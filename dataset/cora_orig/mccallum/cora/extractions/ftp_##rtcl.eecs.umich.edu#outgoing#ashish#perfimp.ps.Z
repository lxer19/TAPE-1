Reference-contexts: If the attached nic does not support QoS functions, as in legacy Ethernet and Token Ring networks, ndd extensions are required to support per-connection QoS via packet queueing and scheduling <ref> [1] </ref>. packet associated with a reservation, the socket layer obtains a buffer by calling qos alloc (), which transfers control to qosmgr. It checks (step 1) whether the application has enabled policing for that reservation (by setting the police flag).

Reference-contexts: Our results also indicate that the QoS support provided has no impact on the performance of the best-effort data path. The performance of protocol stacks has been the subject of numerous research articles, including some very recent ones <ref> [4, 11, 14] </ref>. However, almost all of these studies focus on the traditional best-effort data path. Our study assumes significance in that it quantifies the performance penalty imposed by new data-handling components in the protocol stack, and their impact on the best-effort data path.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The complexity and the overhead of supporting quality of service (QoS) is a critical factor that will ultimately determine the future evolution of integrated services on the Internet. Over the last couple of years a number of studies <ref> [7, 13, 15, 16] </ref> reported in the literature have addressed various issues related to supporting quality of service in the Internet. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no experimental study that analyzes and measures the overhead of offering such services. <p> However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no experimental study that analyzes and measures the overhead of offering such services. We have implemented a prototype system that supports rsvp <ref> [7] </ref> based QoS signaling and several ietf defined QoS classes [13, 15]. Our system consists of servers and clients with appropriate enhancements to the network subsystem to support rsvp signaling and various classes of services.
