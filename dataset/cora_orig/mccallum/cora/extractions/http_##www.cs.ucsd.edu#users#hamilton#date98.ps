Abstract: The importance of fault tolerant design has been steadily increasing as reliance on error free electronics continues to rise in critical military, medical, and automated transportation applications. While rollback and checkpointing techniques facilitate area efficient fault tolerant designs, they are inapplicable to a large class of time-critical applications. We have developed a novel synthesis methodology that avoids rollback, and provides both zero reduction in throughput and near-zero error latency. In addition, our design techniques reduce power requirements associated with traditional approaches to fault tolerance.

Reference-contexts: High-level synthesis approaches, which ameliorate the cost of calculation duplication with techniques such as rollback and load balancing, have proven particularly effective [1] <ref> [2] </ref> [3] [4]. These techniques entail significant error latency, however, making them impractical in applications with strict timing requirements. Furthermore, in order to circumvent overhead, many approaches provide only partial error checking capacity, thereby limiting resilience [5] [6] [7].

For subsequent clarity, we denote a string of operations as a string, while a string and duplicate pair is referred to as a track. As pointed out in <ref> [4] </ref>, the information inherent in error detection can be used for error isolation: when a track reports an error, it is known that one of the units active in that track is faulty.
