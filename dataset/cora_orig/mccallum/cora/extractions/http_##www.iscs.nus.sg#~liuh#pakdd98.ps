Abstract: Various tools and systems for knowledge discovery and data mining are developed and available for applications. However, when we are immersed in heaps of databases, an immediate question facing practitioners is where we should start mining. In this paper, breaking away from the conventional data mining assumption that many databases be joined into one, we argue that the first step for multidatabase mining is to identify databases that are most likely relevant to an application; without doing so, the mining process can be lengthy, aimless and ineffective. A relevance measure is thus proposed to identify relevant databases for mining tasks with an objective to find patterns or regularities about certain attributes. An efficient implementation for identifying relevant databases is described. Experiments are conducted to validate the measure's performance and to show its promising applications.

Reference-contexts: Our example databases are about people's diet habits. It is user's intention to discover some useful knowledge about Chinese food habits from the databases. Here and in most KDD applications, being useful means something that should potentially lead to some useful actions by a user <ref> [4] </ref>. Specific information is one type of usefulness. In our example, the useful knowledge should be some diet habits specific to Chinese. Two tables (databases) with desired attributes, are as shown in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1.

Reference-contexts: Some researchers proposed approaches that determine interestingness of a discovered rule based on user's feedback [16, 10, 14, 8], hence the measurement of interestingness is subjective. Researchers also developed various objective interestingness measures based on the statistics underlying the discovered patterns <ref> [12, 7] </ref>. With the quantitative objective interestingness measure, discovered patterns can be ranked and less interesting ones can be filtered out. Kamber and Shinghal proposed a measure, IC ++ , which is claimed to have the best property regarding evaluating the interestingness of characteristic rules. <p> When we filter out those irrelevant databases, we should not discard the databases that may contain interesting information. To check on this, we apply our method to the example given by <ref> [7] </ref>. The results show that the relevance measure serves the purpose of identifying relevant databases: For the database relevant to the query, interesting rules can be found. Otherwise, the discovered rules are not interesting. Notice that mining rules is more costly than identifying relevant databases.
