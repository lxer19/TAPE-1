Abstract: We give a general technique for proving lower bounds on expected covering times of random walks on graphs in terms of expected hitting times between vertices. We use this technique to prove: In addition to these new results, our technique allows us to systematically prove several known lower bounds on cover times, often in a much simpler way. Finally, we use a different technique to prove an lower bound on the cover time, where 2 is the second largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix. This was previously known only in the case where the walk starts in the stationary distribution [BK]. i) A tight bound of (jV j log 2 jV j) for the 2-dimensional torus.

Reference-contexts: All our lower bounds are valid for any start vertex. Our first bound is for the 2-dimensional torus. The results in <ref> [A1] </ref> imply that the cover time for the k-dimensional torus is fi (n log n), for k 3. As the tight bound of fi (n 2 ) is easy to show for the 1-dimensional case, this left open only the time for the 2-dimensional torus. <p> This lower bound implies the (n log n) bound attained in [BK] for all rapidly mixing walks, as well as tight bounds of fi ( + log n) for rapidly mixing walks on vertex transitive graphs. This generalizes the result in <ref> [A1] </ref> showing this for Cayley graphs. Finally, we use a different technique to show that the expected time to visit a vertex chosen at random according to the stationary distribution does not depend on the start vertex. <p> from the result in [A4] that E T i (1 (i)) 2 =(i): To see where the improvement comes in, we have the following result giving an ( + log n) lower bound for rapidly mixing walks on vertex transitive graphs, generalizing a similar result given for Cayley graphs in <ref> [A1] </ref>. Theorem 13. Define the average hitting time ff = P i;j (i)(j)E i T j . Suppose G is vertex transitive graph and t 2 n 1ffi .

Reference-contexts: Good techniques have been developed to estimate + , which involve calculating resistances of graphs [CRRST] and eigenvalues <ref> [A2] </ref>. Indeed, the E i T j 's are computable in polynomial time, while it is not known if cov is. Therefore, the difficult part in establishing tight bounds for cov tends to be deciding the extra log n factor. <p> Then for any v 2 V , E v C (1 o (1))ffiff ln n: Moreover, E v C (1 + o (1))ff ln n, so E v C = fi (ff log n). Proof. For vertex transitive graphs, E T i = ff for all i (see <ref> [A2] </ref>). Applying Lemma 11 with any * &gt; 0 then gives the first part. In general vertex transitive graphs, ff + 2ff (see [A2]). <p> Proof. For vertex transitive graphs, E T i = ff for all i (see <ref> [A2] </ref>). Applying Lemma 11 with any * &gt; 0 then gives the first part. In general vertex transitive graphs, ff + 2ff (see [A2]). We can reduce the constant 2 in our situation by observing that if we walk for 5t 2 ln n steps, the probability distribution on the vertices is within (1+o (1)) of stationarity.

Reference-contexts: By contrast, a variety of techniques have been used to show the lower bound ( + log n), even though most of the work on lower bounds has been concentrated toward proving the conjectured lower bound of (n log n) for all graphs, regardless of the start vertex. Aldous <ref> [A3] </ref> has proved this bound if the walk starts from the stationary distribution. <p> In this paper, we present a general technique for showing the lower bound ( + log n) that yields all of the lower bounds described above except that given in <ref> [A3] </ref>, as well as new lower bounds. All our lower bounds are valid for any start vertex. Our first bound is for the 2-dimensional torus. The results in [A1] imply that the cover time for the k-dimensional torus is fi (n log n), for k 3. <p> Lower Bound for Slowly Mixing Walks It is conjectured that (n log n) is a lower bound on the expected cover time of any graph. This has been proved in walks starting from the stationary distribution <ref> [A3] </ref>, but it is still open for walks starting at an arbitrary vertex. We complement the above lower bound for rapidly mixing walks with one for slowly mixing walks. This improves the result in [BK], which gives the same lower bound but starting from stationarity.

Reference-contexts: Proof. It suffices to show that for any * &gt; 0, if (i) (1 + *)=n, then E T i (1 o (1))n=(1 + *). But this follows from the result in <ref> [A4] </ref> that E T i (1 (i)) 2 =(i): To see where the improvement comes in, we have the following result giving an ( + log n) lower bound for rapidly mixing walks on vertex transitive graphs, generalizing a similar result given for Cayley graphs in [A1].

Reference-contexts: This was obtained independently using a less general version of our method in [DS]. Aldous has since found the constant for balanced k-ary trees <ref> [A5] </ref>. Third, we give a lower bound for rapidly mixing walks. By rapidly mixing, we mean t 2 n 1ffi , ffi &gt; 0, where t 2 = 1=(1 2 ) is a measure of how quickly the random walk approaches stationarity ( 2 is the second largest eigenvalue). <p> The upper bound follows from Theorem 1 by noting that E i T j 2n for i; j neighbors, so E i T j 2nd (i; j), and the diameter of these trees are at most 2 log k n. Remark. Aldous <ref> [A5] </ref> has since shown that, for balanced k-ary trees, E v C ~ 2n log k n ln n. 6.

Then ff = k=2 t k ; where t k = 1=(1 k ): We improve their result by showing that the expected time to get to a random vertex is independent of the start vertex.
