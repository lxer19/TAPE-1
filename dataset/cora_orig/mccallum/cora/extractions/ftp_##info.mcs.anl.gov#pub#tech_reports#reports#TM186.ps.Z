Reference-contexts: The version for the present study has a horizontal spectral resolution of T42 and a corresponding grid resolution of approximately 2.8 by 2.8 degrees, giving 64 by 128 horizontal grid points. CCM2 has 18 vertical levels. Radiation calculations are performed using the delta-Eddington method for the shortwave radiation <ref> [1] </ref> and and solving the transfer equations for the longwave radiation using absorptivities and emissivities. Moist convection uses the mass flux convective parameterization of [5]. The present version of CCM2 has specified moisture over the land surface.

Reference-contexts: The sections to instrument were identified with the help of David Williamson and Jim Hack, who have been central to the development of CCM at NCAR and who are members of the working group that produced PCCM2 under the U.S. Department of Energy CHAMMP initiative <ref> [2] </ref>. The first column of Table 1 shows the sections of the physics subtree that were separately instrumented.

Reference-contexts: One method for dividing work between processors is domain (or data) decomposition. Domain decomposition can be either by latitude or longitude alone (one-dimensional decomposition) or by latitude and longitude (two-dimensional decomposition). The method of parallelizing the dynamics of an atmospheric (spectral) model is discussed in <ref> [3] </ref>. A similar methodology has been employed for the parallel implementation of the CCM2. The grid-point domain is patch-decomposed over processors in both the latitudinal and longitudinal dimensions, with the added constraint that each processor has both northern and corresponding southern latitudes (Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: After shortwave radiation, the exchange is reversed. In spite of the cost of performing the exchanges, the load-balancing code resulted in a 6 percent overall improvement in model run times <ref> [4] </ref>. 10 values are dark; highest values are light. The top and bottom of the plot are the north and south poles. Left and right edges correspond to the prime meridian. Each cell represents two grid points in the model domain. <p> This imbalance is due to the additional computation required over the grid points in the day region (receiving solar radiation). Attempts are being made to reduce this imbalance 13 in the parallel model by moving computations from more heavily loaded daylight regions to the less-loaded nighttime processors <ref> [4] </ref>. Weather patterns (resulting in moist convective instability) are also a major cause of imbalance (about 17 percent of the total imbalance during an average time step).

Compute the tendencies, and update the variables (excluding moisture) to the latest time step. 4.

Reference-contexts: Computational load in physics varies with the state of the model variables. Studies conducted with sequential versions of CCM1 running on CRAY computers showed that the load in physics computations can vary for the following reasons <ref> [7] </ref>: 1. Spatial variation of the load from (a) surface type (b) polar night (c) weather patterns (d) day and night (diurnal cycle) 2.
