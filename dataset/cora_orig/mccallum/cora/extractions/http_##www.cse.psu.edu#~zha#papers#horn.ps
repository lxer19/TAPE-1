Title: A NOTE ON CONSTRUCTING A SYMMETRIC MATRIX WITH SPECIFIED DIAGONAL ENTRIES AND EIGENVALUES  
Author: HONGYUAN ZHA AND ZHENYUE ZHANG 
Abstract: A finite step algorithm is given such that for any two vectors a; 2 R n with a majoried by , it computes a symmetric matrix H 2 R nfin with the elements of a and as its diagonal entries and eigenvalues, respectively.
