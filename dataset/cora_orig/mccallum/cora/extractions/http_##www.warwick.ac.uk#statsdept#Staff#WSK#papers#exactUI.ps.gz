Abstract: Recently Propp and Wilson [14] have proposed an algorithm, called Coupling from the Past (CFTP), which allows not only an approximate but perfect (i.e. exact) simulation of the stationary distribution of certain finite state space Markov chains. Perfect Sampling using CFTP has been successfully extended to the context of point processes, amongst other authors, by Haggstrom et al. [5]. In [5] Gibbs sampling is applied to a bivariate point process, the penetrable spheres mixture model [19]. However, in general the running time of CFTP in terms of number of transitions is not independent of the state sampled. Thus an impatient user who aborts long runs may introduce a subtle bias, the user impatience bias. Fill [3] introduced an exact sampling algorithm for finite state space Markov chains which, in contrast to CFTP, is unbiased for user impatience. Fill's algorithm is a form of rejection sampling and similar to CFTP requires sufficient mono-tonicity properties of the transition kernel used. We show how Fill's version of rejection sampling can be extended to an infinite state space context to produce an exact sample of the penetrable spheres mixture process and related models. Following [5] we use Gibbs sampling and make use of the partial order of the mixture model state space. Thus

Reference-contexts: Haggstrom et al. [5], Kendall [7] and Kendall & Mtller [8] have extended CFTP to the context of point processes. In [7] spatial birth/death processes were used allowing the exact simulation of several point processes, in particular the attractive and repulsive area interaction process <ref> [1, 19] </ref>. In [5] CFTP was used for a Gibbs sampler producing exact samples of a bivariate point process, the penetrable spheres mixture model [19], and related models, in particular the attractive (but not repulsive) area-interaction. <p> We can simulate X using the following transition rule: for x = 0; 2 ( minfx + 1; 2g if U &gt; 1=2 for x = 1 where U is a uniform random variable on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Note that this transition rule is not monotone, so we need to start our simulation from all three initial states and check the resulting paths for coalescence. Now suppose the user terminates a run of CFTP whenever I iterations have been completed without producing output. <p> The mixture model is related to two other point processes, the area-interaction process and the continuum random-cluster model. The area-interaction point process, studied in Baddeley and Van Lieshout <ref> [1] </ref>, has the following density with respect to a unit-rate Poisson point process restricted to W : (x) = ff 1 1 fl 1 : (2) The factor ff 1 is the normalising constant, 1 ; fl 1 &gt; 0 are model parameters and m d denotes the Lebesgue measure in

Reference-contexts: As will be shown in [8] CFTP can also be applied to Metropolis-Hastings algorithms. 4 2 User Impatience Bias Fill <ref> [3] </ref> points out that a drawback of CFTP is the fact that the running time in terms of Markov transitions and the state sampled by the algorithm are not independent. Hence an impatient user who aborts long runs may introduce a subtle bias. <p> Here is an example of a Markov chain for which protection against this kind of bias is automatic. Consider a Markov chain Y on f0; 1g with transition matrix P Y = 1 1 1 0 : This Markov chain, which was also considered in <ref> [3] </ref> and [7], has equilibrium distribution ( 0 ; 1 ) = (2=3; 1=3). <p> P (Nk) (0; 0) fi ( 1 1 ( 1 = k=1 2 3 ( 1 2 ) k 2 ) N = 3 For more examples illustrating the bias caused by user impatience, bounds on the magnitude of this bias and further comments see sections 5.2 and 6.1 in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 Fill's Interruptible Algorithm Fill's algorithm does not use CFTP but is based on a different idea, namely rejection sampling, which protects against user impatience bias. The setting for this algorithm is as follows. <p> Fill <ref> [3] </ref> shows that because upward kernels of ~ P are used to produce ~ Y , the probability of ~ Y N = ^ 0 is equal to 1 fi P (N) ( ^ 0; z) whence the rejection sampling procedure is carried out correctly. <p> Fill uses an analogous result but without proof, see section 7.3 in <ref> [3] </ref>. We include a proof, as the result is unfamiliar in the context of point processes, though it is very familiar to workers in Markov chain theory. Let f (x; y) denote the density of the mixture model given in (1). <p> ); Z 2 ) = (~x 1 ; ~y 1 ): Hence the transitions of our second chain are made according to upward kernels of the transition kernels ~p x (x 0 jy) and ~p y (y 0 jx); see section 3 in this paper and section 7.1 in Fill <ref> [3] </ref> for further comments on upward kernels. The Acceptance algorithm was chosen such that the Rejection Sampling algorithm has the appropriate acceptance probability. To show this we will need the following result about the distribution of the output produced by N iterations of Acceptance. <p> The reversal and acceptance step in our algorithm ensures that the sample actually has the stationary distribution. How does this work? This section follows closely Fill's argument in section 7.3 of <ref> [3] </ref>. The algorithm is a form of rejection sampling: the Proposal algorithm proposes a sample and 20 the Acceptance algorithm accepts it with an appropriate probability. <p> The implementation of our algorithm also enables us to compare it to the analogous algorithm using CFTP in [5] with respect to memory and expected number of transitions needed. Fill <ref> [3] </ref> shows that for a finite Markov Chain a naive implementation of the algorithm needs more memory than the analogous algorithm using CFTP. It is clear that similarly our algorithm will also need more memory than the CFTP algorithm in [5].

Reference-contexts: Instead we construct a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is , and simulate a long run. For an overview on MCMC techniques see e.g. Gilks et al. <ref> [4] </ref>. A common problem when using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods is the difficulty of determining the length of simulation required to obtain a sufficiently good approximation.

This enables us to extend Fill's algorithm to produce an exact sample of the mixture model. The problem setting differs from Fill's in two respects. <p> As shown by Haggstrom et al. <ref> [5] </ref> Gibbs sampling applied to 9 the penetrable spheres mixture model is monotone with respect to a partial order defined in [5]. This enables us to extend Fill's algorithm to produce an exact sample of the mixture model. The problem setting differs from Fill's in two respects. Firstly, in contrast to the Markov chains studied by Fill, the state space of the point processes considered is not finite but uncountable. <p> We assume that the grain of the process G is a sphere of radius R. Consider again the penetrable spheres mixture model. The marginal distribution of X is an area-interaction model with interaction parameters 1 = fi 1 and fl 1 = e fi 2 , see <ref> [5, 19] </ref>. The same result holds for the marginal distribution of Y with the roles of fi 1 and fi 2 exchanged. <p> Its relationship to the penetrable spheres mixture model is as follows. Consider the superposition of the two types of points Z = X [ Y in the symmetric mixture model, i.e. with fi 1 = fi 2 : As shown in <ref> [5] </ref> this superposition is a continuum random-cluster model with radii R=2 and parameters 2 = fi 1 = fi 2 and fl 2 = 1=2. We mentioned earlier that the conditional distributions of X and Y are Poisson processes, which are easy to sample. <p> We mentioned earlier that the conditional distributions of X and Y are Poisson processes, which are easy to sample. Hence Gibbs sampling, which is an MCMC method which samples conditional distributions, allows for an easy simulation of the mixture model, see <ref> [5, 12] </ref>. <p> Gibbs sampling is an easy way to obtain such a Markov chain for the penetrable spheres mixture model. We use the same Gibbs Sampler as <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Detailed balance holds, i.e. f (x; y)p y (y 0 jx) = f (x; y 0 )p y 0 (yjx) and As pointed out earlier, Fill's idea requires that the transition kernels used have appropriate stochastic monotonicity properties. Consider the following partial order on S 2 introduced in <ref> [5] </ref>: Definition 5.1 We call (x; y) (x 0 ; y 0 ) if x x 0 and y y 0 : Let P be a transition kernel on the partially ordered state space (S 2 ; ). <p> In contrast to Fill's setting, our Markov chain is defined on an uncountable state space which, although it has a partial order, does not have a unique maximal or minimal state. Instead <ref> [5] </ref> calls an element (x; y) quasimaximal, if the induced set of the first type of points x G covers the whole window and the induced set of the second type of points y G is the empty set, that is Similarly, the element (x; y) is quasiminimal, if x = <p> Thus the path started in the quasiminimal state will always lie below the path started in (x 0 ; y 0 ) (with respect to ). The result can be proved analogously for the case of GibbsSampling2. Note that this Lemma is equivalent to Lemma 4 in <ref> [5] </ref>. 6 The time reversal step In the first step of our algorithm we run N iterations of the Gibbs sampler and obtain a realisation of the sequence (X k ; Y k ) k2f0;:::Ng : We then reverse the obtained sequence of point patterns in time, i.e. we set ~ <p> Figure 1 shows some samples of the penetrable spheres mixture model obtained through the new algorithm. We use the same display as Haggstrom et al. in <ref> [5] </ref>. The first type of points is pictured as a dot, the second type is pictured as a cross. The circles are of radius R=2 and show the area around a point in which no point of the other type is allowed. <p> Note that for a larger value of fi phase transitions seem to begin to occur and one of the components dominates. The implementation of our algorithm also enables us to compare it to the analogous algorithm using CFTP in <ref> [5] </ref> with respect to memory and expected number of transitions needed. Fill [3] shows that for a finite Markov Chain a naive implementation of the algorithm needs more memory than the analogous algorithm using CFTP. <p> Fill [3] shows that for a finite Markov Chain a naive implementation of the algorithm needs more memory than the analogous algorithm using CFTP. It is clear that similarly our algorithm will also need more memory than the CFTP algorithm in <ref> [5] </ref>. Fill [3] also derives some properties of the number of iterations used by the algorithm in terms of the separation. The proofs also hold for an uncountable state space with a fixed quasimaximal and quasiminimal state, we therefore just summarize the results given in section 8 of [3]. <p> Both bounds rely strongly on the assumption of having a finite state space. At present there are no bounds on the number of expected transitions for the algorithm in <ref> [5] </ref>. Thus in order to compare the number of iterations I needed for our algorithm with the number of iterations needed for CFTP we performed some simulation experiments. <p> Figure 2 shows the Monte Carlo estimates of the expected number of iterations I of the Rejection Sampling alogrithm. To enable the comparison with the Monte Carlo estimates in <ref> [5] </ref> we plotted the average number of iterations for a symmetric penetrable spheres mixture model versus the parameter = log (fi 1 ) = log (fi 2 ): We found that Rejection Sampling used about the same number of iterations as CFTP. 24 for the symmetric mixture model as a function <p> We have illustrated how Fill's algorithm can be combined with the Gibbs sampler in <ref> [5] </ref> to produce exact samples of the penetrable spheres mixture process and associates. The Gibbs sampler used is restricted to attractive versions of the penetrable spheres mixture process and related models. <p> It would be useful to develop Fill's version of Rejection Sampling for algorithms of greater generality as in [7] and [8] which can e.g. also sample the repulsive area interaction. In fact we examined these methods for a possible application of Rejection sampling. As in <ref> [5] </ref> the methods in [7] and [8] define quasimaximal and quasiminimal states, but in contrast to [5] these states can not be fixed but are stochastically varying.

In [7] spatial birth/death processes were used allowing the exact simulation of several point processes, in particular the attractive and repulsive area interaction process <ref> [1, 19] </ref>. In [5] CFTP was used for a Gibbs sampler producing exact samples of a bivariate point process, the penetrable spheres mixture model [19], and related models, in particular the attractive (but not repulsive) area-interaction. <p> In [7] spatial birth/death processes were used allowing the exact simulation of several point processes, in particular the attractive and repulsive area interaction process [1, 19].

Consider again the penetrable spheres mixture model. The marginal distribution of X is an area-interaction model with interaction parameters 1 = fi 1 and fl 1 = e fi 2 , see <ref> [5, 19] </ref>. The same result holds for the marginal distribution of Y with the roles of fi 1 and fi 2 exchanged.
