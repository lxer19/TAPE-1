Abstract: Pugh's recent paper [Pug92] claims to find problems with current "definitions" of dependence distance. In fact, a single coherent definition is the vector distance between the iteration vectors of two iterations involved in a dependence relation. Different ways to associate iteration vectors with iterations can give different dependence distances to the same program, and have different advantages. Data dependence distance vectors are used to characterize the relative positions in the iteration space of the two ends of a data dependence relation, in particular for dependence relations caused by array references. These have quite a long history in program analysis, dating back at least 25 years [KMW67]. We assume the reader is comfortable with concepts of data dependence and dependence distance; good overviews can be found in many places in the literature [PW86, ZC91]. Pugh's recent paper [Pug92] suggests there are problems with how dependence distance is defined and used. Actually, in all cases known to this author, the data dependence distance can be defined as the vector difference between the iteration vectors of the target and the source iterations. This requires that an iteration vector (usually an integer vector) be associated with each iteration. Note that the dependence distance concept is orthogonal to the type of data dependence relation (flow, anti or output [PW86, ZC91]). There is some variation in how the iteration vectors are associated with iterations. In particular the question arises whether to "normalize" or not. If the iteration vectors are normalized, the first iteration of each loop is associated with the zero vector, and subsequent iteration vectors are incremented by one. Without normalization, each iteration is associated with a vector of loop index variable values; Pugh
