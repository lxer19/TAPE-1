Reference-contexts: Figures 4.4 and 4.5 show a 3-D grid in physical and computational space, respectively. At each of these points, it is possible to use central-differences to compute partial derivatives of (x; y; z) with respect to (~; ; ). This yields the matrix of transformation metrics <ref> [Anderson84] </ref>, 0 @ x y z 1 A ; where each of these parameters involves a partial derivative with respect to the computational axes. Since transformation information is only available at discrete points, it is necessary to compute these derivatives by means of central differences.

Reference-contexts: Wadsworth has applied a parallel, three-dimensional code to simulate a simplified, quarter-symmetric, version of the GEC reference cell [Wadsworth95]. This implementation uses ray tracing and grid-based partitioning under PVM, and includes static load balancing. Bartel has performed axisymmetric simulations of plasma reactors, with multiple species and constant electromagnetic fields <ref> [Bartel95] </ref>. Electron distributions are solved by a separate fluid model. Nambu and Uchida have combined the DSMC and PIC techniques to handle self-consistent fields, sputtering, and multiple species [Nambu95]. Their technique has been applied to one-dimensional problems, with decoupled neutral flow, ion formation, sputtering, and the transfer of sputtered atoms.

Reference-contexts: Macroscopic properties, such as density and temperature, can be computed by appropriate averaging 10 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION of particle masses, positions, and velocities. Surface properties are calculated from the momentum and energy exchanges during collisions with surfaces. This technique, named Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), was developed by Bird <ref> [Bird94] </ref>. The computational requirements of DSMC have, in the past, limited applications to relatively simple geometries or highly rarefied flows. Recently developed massively parallel machines and clusters of high-performance workstations have made it possible to address more complex problems. <p> Dimensions All variables in Hawk are in SI units. Many implementations use dimensionless, normalized parameters exclusively, in order to minimize rounding errors. The normalization process, however, is more complex than is warranted, and an opportunity for introduction of subtle errors. As Bird says <ref> [Bird94] </ref>, 13 The molecular models are now sufficiently realistic for the simulation results to be compared directly with the measured values. It is therefore desirable for all the variables in the programs to be in a dimensioned form. <p> Some focus on complex chemistry but do not support realistic geometries. Others have parallel implementations that are not scalable or do not support load balancing. Bird pioneered the DSMC technique [Bird70a] and wrote two books about it <ref> [Bird94, Bird76] </ref>. He has studied the breakdown of translational and rotational equilibrium in gaseous expansions, using rough sphere molecules [Bird70], and his code has been used to simulate flow around the Space Shuttle using 700 cells and 8,000 simulated particles [Bird78]. 15 16 CHAPTER 2. <p> Chapter 3 Description of the Method 3.1 Overview of the DSMC Method The DSMC (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo) method was developed to allow for the solution of problems that could not be correctly handled by the Euler or Navier-Stokes methods beacause of a high degree of rarefaction <ref> [Bird94] </ref>. <p> @c Z 1 Z 4 n 2 (f fl f fl where n is the number density, f is the velocity distribution function, r is the position vector in velocity space, c is the velocity, F is the external force per unit mass, and the integral describes the collision process <ref> [Bird94] </ref>. The main problem with solving the Boltzmann equation directly is the evaluation of the collision integral. Using a quadrature formula to evaluate it would require 3,200,000 evaluations at each grid point, for each possible velocity, and at each timestep. This is clearly impractical for realistic simulations. <p> Inflow Count The molecular speed ratio s i is given by s i = j~cjfi i . The particle flux i can be computed, as described in <ref> [Bird94] </ref>, using, i = exp [(s i cos ) 2 + s i cos (1 + erf (s i cos ))]: The number of simulated particles crossing the face, per unit area, per unit time, n i , is then, n i = 2F N fi i 36 CHAPTER 4. <p> For example, if the average is 2.9, it will be rounded to 3 with probability 0.9, otherwise rounded to 2. Inflow Velocity The velocity of an injected particle is determined using an acceptance-rejection sampling method, as described in <ref> [Bird94] </ref>. Let u n = ~c ^n be the normal component of the velocity, and let s n = u n fi. <p> In large simulations, any of these flaws can lead to erroneous results. Numerical Recipies in C [Press92] presents a suite of random number generators of varying quality and speed. These generators were compared using a C implementation of Bird's program RANDIST <ref> [Bird94] </ref>. This test is designed to evaluate the uniformity of the generated numbers as follows. A large two 100 fi 100 integer array is initialized to zero. <p> In reactors, particles arrive through low-velocity pumping ports. It is therefore important for Hawk to include a general inflow mechanism that is valid for both high and low mach numbers. For each inflow cell face, the normal and tangential velocity components are sampled from separate distribution functions <ref> [Bird94] </ref>. These routines were tested by running flow through a tube in a variety of configurations. The average cell densities and net velocities were then compared with those specified for the inflow 54 CHAPTER 5.

Reference-contexts: This is clearly impractical for realistic simulations. Particle methods, such as the DSMC technique, avoid this complexity by replacing the density distribution function with a number of simulation particles that move and collide <ref> [Cercignani94] </ref>. While most systems of interest would contain at least Avagadro's Number (10 23 ) particles, current computational resources can cope with no more than about 10 8 particles. A small number of simulation particles is therefore used to represent a large number of real particles.

INTRODUCTION Chapter 2 Related Work Reactor Simulations Hitchon, et. al., have implemented a nonstatistical technique for studying the transport of sputtered neutral particles <ref> [Parker95] </ref>. Their convective scheme (CS) has also been used to solve the Boltzmann equation in a cylindrical geometry [Parker94]. Hitchon has performed a detailed study on the sensitivity of simulations to collision techniques [Hitchon94].

Reference-contexts: They present two-dimensional results obtained on a Fujitsu AP1000, and have demonstrated a speedup of up to 42 on 64 processors. Parsons has written about software engineering methodology for DSMC codes, promoting the use of object-oriented and multi-agent systems paradigms <ref> [Parsons95] </ref>. Results for two-dimensional object-oriented implementations have been presented. The organization and structure of this code appear to be similar to that of Hawk . The use of the multi-agent systems paradigm is an intriguing possibility, particularly in the context of parallel processing.

Reference-contexts: DSMC codes are potentially sensitive to several possible flaws in random number generators. Common problems include short periods, non-uniformity, and correlations between consecutive numbers. In large simulations, any of these flaws can lead to erroneous results. Numerical Recipies in C <ref> [Press92] </ref> presents a suite of random number generators of varying quality and speed. These generators were compared using a C implementation of Bird's program RANDIST [Bird94]. This test is designed to evaluate the uniformity of the generated numbers as follows. <p> MHz Silicon Graphics Indigo 2. ran0 is the minimal generator of Park and Miller. ran1 includes the Bays-Durham shuffle and added safeguards. ran2 is a L'Ecuyer's generator with Bays-Durham shuffle and added safeguards. ran3 is Knuth's version of a subtractive method, and ran4 is based on pseudo - DES encryption <ref> [Press92] </ref>. Small simulations were performed using each of the generators described above and the results were identical. For large simulations, however, ran2 was selected because of its 45 46 CHAPTER 5.

Reference-contexts: Once self-consistent electromagnetic fields have been incorporated, it will also be useful for backflow contamination and other free-molecular problems such as have been traditionally simulated using the Particle-In-Cell technique <ref> [Roy95] </ref>. The results of this work show that large-scale simulations of realistic plasma reactors are possible. For realistic simulations, two-dimensional axisymmetric calculations are insufficient. In order to support complex geometries and adaptation, dynamic data structures are necessary.

Reference-contexts: These parameters are written to a log file to allow the user to monitor the progress of the simulation. 4.3 Portability Portability of Hawk 's communication and synchronization routines is obtained through use of the Concurrent Graph Library <ref> [Taylor95] </ref>. All Concurrent Graph Library applications share the same structure, allowing the functionality to be encapsulated in consistent software interfaces. Communication in the Concurrent Graph Library is based on a low latency remote 24 CHAPTER 4. IMPLEMENTATION procedure call (RPC).

Reference-contexts: Zhong and Koura have compared DSMC results with solutions of the Burnett and Navier-Stokes equations, for Couette flow and heat transfer problems [Zhong95]. These results were used for validation of Hawk 's physics, in Chapter 5. Wadsworth has also studied <ref> [Wadsworth93] </ref> slip effects in rarefied gas and compared the results of DSMC and Navier-Stokes methods, with a variety of gas-surface interaction models. These results were compared with experimental data obtained by Alofs [Alofs71].

Reference-contexts: Techniques have also been presented [Hitchon91] that permit the results of computationally inexpensive simulations to be extrapolated to obtain results comparable to those from lengthy simulations. Wadsworth has applied a parallel, three-dimensional code to simulate a simplified, quarter-symmetric, version of the GEC reference cell <ref> [Wadsworth95] </ref>. This implementation uses ray tracing and grid-based partitioning under PVM, and includes static load balancing. Bartel has performed axisymmetric simulations of plasma reactors, with multiple species and constant electromagnetic fields [Bartel95]. Electron distributions are solved by a separate fluid model.

Reference-contexts: Setting the number of cells per partition also facilitates control over the granularity of the computation, i.e. the ratio of computation to communication. The granularity can even be dynamically adjusted by splitting and combining partitions, and dynamic load balancing can be achieved by moving partitions between computers <ref> [Watts95] </ref>. (See Section 6.5 for load balancing results.) The parallel algorithm is almost identical to the sequential algorithm. In both, each cell moves and collides its particles independently. During the course of a timestep in a partition, particles move across cell faces on the ends of the partition.

Reference-contexts: The database format is designed in such a way that new data elements can be added without introducing incompatibilities with existing application. This is accomplished by various markers indicating version number as well as elements that contain counts of non-descipt sets of data. SCP's extio library <ref> [Watts95a] </ref> is used in conjunction with the GDBM system to allow storage to disk that is independent of machine word size. XFalcon presently supports an atomic content description of the species it contains.

Reference-contexts: Experiments and Comparisons Economou and Aydil have conducted experiments, monitoring etch rates and surface chemistry in plasma reactors [Economou91, Aydil94, Aydil95]. Zhong and Koura have compared DSMC results with solutions of the Burnett and Navier-Stokes equations, for Couette flow and heat transfer problems <ref> [Zhong95] </ref>. These results were used for validation of Hawk 's physics, in Chapter 5. Wadsworth has also studied [Wadsworth93] slip effects in rarefied gas and compared the results of DSMC and Navier-Stokes methods, with a variety of gas-surface interaction models. <p> Simulation results were quantitatively validated by comparison against another DSMC code. A convenient example was the study of the heat transfer problem presented by Zhong and Koura <ref> [Zhong95] </ref>. These cases are for one-dimensional problems in which both the Knudsen number and fi are varied. Simulations were performed using a 400-cell grid and an average of 10 particles per cell.
