Abstract: This paper presents the OTSO method for reusable component selection. The OTSO method has been developed to provide a basis for evaluating and selecting reusable components for software development. The main characteristics of the OTSO method include (i) a well-defined, documented process, (ii) hierarchical and detailed evaluation criteria decomposition and definition, (iii) a model for making alternatives comparable in terms of cost and added value they produce, and (iv) use of appropriate techniques for consolidating evaluation data. The OTSO method has been evaluated in two real-world case studies. The case studies indicated that a well-defined process allows the selection process to take place efficiently, the overhead of formal criteria definition is marginal, and the use of different data consolidation methods may influence the results.
