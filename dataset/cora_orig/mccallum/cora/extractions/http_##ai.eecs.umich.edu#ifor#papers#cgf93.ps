Abstract: Training in flight simulators will be more effective if the agents involved in the simulation behave realistically. Accomplishing this requires that the automated agents be under autonomous, intelligent control. We are using the Soar cognitive architecture to implement intelligent agents that behave as much like humans as possible. In order to approximate human behavior, the agents must integrate planning and reaction in real time, adapt to new and unexpected situations, learn with experience, and exhibit the cognitive limitations and strengths of humans. This paper describes two simple tactical flight scenarios and the knowledge required for an agent to complete them. In addition, the paper describes an implemented agent model that performs in limited tactical scenarios on three different flight simulators. To construct such intelligent, automated agents, we have applied techniques from the fields of artificial intelligence and cognitive science. The agents are implemented within the Soar system, a state-of-the-art, integrated cognitive architecture (Rosen- bloom et al., 1991). These agents incorporate knowledge gleaned from interviews with experts in flight tactics and analysis of the tactical domain. Soar is a promising candidate for developing agents that behave like humans. Flexible and adaptive behavior is one of Soar's primary strengths, and Soar's learning mechanism provides it with the capability of improving its performance with experience. In addition, Soar allows the smooth integration of planning and reaction in decision making (Pearson

Reference-contexts: We have not completed the incorporation of this knowledge into the agent yet, but we are taking advantage of the strengths of the Soar architecture in order to implement these two important capabilities <ref> (Covrigaru, 1992) </ref>. Discussion We have implemented an intelligent, autonomous agent that completes missions in a simple tactical scenario. The agent is designed with flexibility in mind. It reasons from first principles about high-level tactical decisions, and is thus able to reason in unexpected situations and recover gracefully from mistakes.

Reference-contexts: In addition, Soar allows the smooth integration of planning and reaction in decision making (Pearson et al, 1993). Finally, Soar is the foundation for the development of a proposed unified theory of human cognition <ref> (Newell, 1990) </ref>, and thus maps quite well onto a number of the cognitive issues of interest. <p> The ease of adding new knowledge to the system also makes it possible to incorporate existing machine-learning mechanisms. These can allow the system to adapt and improve its behavior with experience, as well as provide insights into how human pilots learn about tactics. The Soar architecture for problem solving <ref> (Newell, 1990) </ref> is well suited for this type of task. It divides knowledge into problem spaces and allows goals and actions in one problem space to be implemented via reasoning in another.
