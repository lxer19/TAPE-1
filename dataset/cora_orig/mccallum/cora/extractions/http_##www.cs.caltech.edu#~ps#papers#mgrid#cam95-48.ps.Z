Abstract: Stabilizing the Hierarchical Basis by Approximate Wavelets, II: Implementation and Numerical Results Abstract. This paper is the second part of a work on stabilizing the classical hierarchical basis (HB) by using wavelet-like basis functions. Implementation techniques are discussed for the multilevel preconditioners proposed by the authors in the first part of the work [14]. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the convergence theory established in [14].

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In this paper we implement the wavelet-modified hierarchical basis method proposed in [14]. The method was based on the use of some approximate L 2 -projections which stabilize the classical hierarchical basis ([16], <ref> [4] </ref>) by taking away from each hierarchical basis function its approximate L 2 -projection on coarse levels. The modified or stabilized hierarchical basis shall be called AWM-HB (Approximate Wavelet Modified Hierarchical Basis). Applications in the multilevel preconditioning for finite element discretizations of elliptic partial differential equations are called AWM-HB methods. <p> The multiplicative method with m = 0 corresponds to the method of Vassilevski [11], which coincides with the HB-MG method of Bank, Dupont, and Yserentant <ref> [4] </ref>. The additive method with m = 0 is then a variant of the HB method of Yserentant [16].

This is very well seen from the columns for the multiplicative AWM-HB preconditioner in Table 3. Thus, as proved in <ref> [16] </ref>, the choice of m is practically not affected by J . For example, m = 2 (see Table 2) gives also weakly sensitive values of the number of iterations (as well as eigenvalues) when J varies from 3 to 7.
