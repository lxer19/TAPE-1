Abstract: High-level understanding of data must involve the interplay between substantial prior knowledge with geometric and statistical techniques. Our approach emphasizes the recovery of basic structural elements and their interaction patterns in order to summarize and draw inferences about the significant features contained in the data. As a testbed for modeling how scientists analyze and extract knowledge of structure morphogenesis from data, we examine the datasets obtained from numerical simulation of turbulence. We describe a program that automatically extracts 3D structures, classifies them geometrically, and analyzes their spatial and temporal coherence. Our program is constructed by mixing and matching the aggregate, classify, and re-describe operators of the spatial aggregation language. The research is a continuation of the effort to investigate the role of imagistic reasoning in human thinking.

Reference-contexts: For example, a vortex accelerates velocity (lifts) on one side and slows down on another. A bent vortex exerts a self-induced motion along its binormal and the effect is proportional to the cur vature of the bent <ref> [ Arms and Hama, 1965 ] </ref> . 5 Experiment As a testbed, we choose a direct numerical simulation 4 of free surface turbulence generated by a shear flow in a 128 3 rectangular box. The problem is important for several reasons.

Reference-contexts: The reoriented points also serve as input to the detailed surface classification. 4.4 Classifying surfaces The marching cube algorithm and the vortex line integration provide a surface representation of the fluid structures. To classify the structures, we need to recover their 3D geometry. We use generalized cylinders (GC) <ref> [ Binford, 1990 ] </ref> as our basic shape model. A generalized cylinder consists of a spline, a cross-section, and a sweeping rule. It is particularly useful for our problem because to a first approximation vortices are elongated slender structures which bend and turn.

Reference-contexts: We also use a more general shape model and explore the coincidence of different definitions of a coherent vortex.

Reference-contexts: It has been recently proposed that a definition of vortex in an incompressible flow in terms of the second eigenvalues of the symmetric tensor S 2 and 2 where S and are respectively the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor ru <ref> [ Jeong and Hussain, 1995 ] </ref> . The symmetric part determines the contribution to local pressure minimum due to rotational motion alone. This proposed definition is attractive computationally because it refers to the isosurfaces of a scalar field, the second eigenvalues of the symmetric tensor.

Reference-contexts: Some examples are the low pressure region, the high-speed streak, and the eigenvalues of the velocity gradient. A popular method to render isosurface is the march-ing cube algorithm <ref> [ Lorensen and Cline, 1987 ] </ref> . The algorithm divides the field into little cubes.

Reference-contexts: We adopt the following working definition for vortices: Definition A coherent vortex is a compact bundle of adjacent, high-intensity vortex lines that are geometrically similar. Aggregating vortex lines to form coherent structures is not straightforward. Previous researchers <ref> [ Moin and Kim, 1985; Robinson, 1991 ] </ref> have found that vortex lines are sensitive to initial conditions. Nearby vortex lines can diverge rapidly.

Reference-contexts: To see an example of this kind of understanding that fluid dynamicists arrive at after detailed investigation of simulation data, let us quote a passage in the concluding section of <ref> [ Robinson, 1991 ] </ref> : The main conclusion is that the self-maintaining cycle of turbulence production in the boundary layer is driven by the formation or regeneration of embedded vortical structures... A mature vortical arch gives rise to a trailing quasi-streamwise vortex... <p> We adopt the following working definition for vortices: Definition A coherent vortex is a compact bundle of adjacent, high-intensity vortex lines that are geometrically similar.

Reference-contexts: The agreement is surprisingly good. 6 Related Work Our research shares some of the objectives with the visualization work in Rutgers <ref> [ Silver and Zabusky, 1993 ] </ref> . The Rutgers group is interested in better interactive tools for helping scientists visualizing the datasets. In particular, they use ellipsoids to fit isosurfaces of vor-ticity, the modulus of the vorticity vector.

Reference-contexts: We use scientific datasets as a testbed in order to exploit the vast amount of accumulated specialized knowledge. Scientists' reasoning about fluid dynamical objects rely on the same intuitive concepts of objects: cohesiveness and continuity <ref> [ Spelke et al., 1995 ] </ref> . An object is cohesive if it is internally connected, externally bounded, and moves while maintaining its connectedness and boundedness. The motion of an object is not arbitrary; it traces one connected path in space-time and leaves no gaps.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we propose a model to reason about spatially distributed, temporally evolving 3D structures in the domain of fluid dynamics. Our model aims to capture the process by which human scientists interpret numerical simulation data.

Reference-contexts: In our implementation, we find it more convenient to use the entire table of 2 8 intersection patterns. flow field, making the identification of organized structure extremely difficult. This might explain why vortex lines have not been widely used for structure identification. Our search algorithm for vortices is adaptive <ref> [ Yip, 1995 ] </ref> : it exploits local geometry (e.g., converging or diverging) of the vorticity lines to decide the direction and step size of integration. 4.3 Object Cohesiveness There is a degree of arbitrariness in defining structures in terms of isosurfaces.

Reference-contexts: It is particularly useful for our problem because to a first approximation vortices are elongated slender structures which bend and turn. Recovery of GC descriptions from images is a hard problem in computer vision because of noise and occlusion ( <ref> [ Zerroug and Nevatia, 1996 ] </ref> ). Our problem is different and is much easier. We aim to recover the GC descriptions from 3D surface points.
