Abstract: Rapid advances in High Performance Computing (HPC) and the Internet are heralding a paradigm shift to network-based scientific software servers, libraries, repositories and problem solving environments. According to this new paradigm, vital pieces of software and information required for a computation are distributed across a network and need to be identified and `linked' together at run time; this implies a `net-centric' and collaborative scenario for scientific computing. This scenario requires the application to dynamically choose the best among several competing resources that can solve a given problem. For these systems to become ubiquitous, efficient mechanisms for collaboration and automatic inference of the abilities of multiple `compute servers' need to be established. In this paper, we demonstrate a methodology to facilitate collaborative scientific computing. Our idea comprises of (i) a concept of `reasonableness' to automatically generate exemplars for learning the mapping from problems to `servers' and (ii) a neuro-fuzzy technique developed earlier by the authors that conducts supervised classification on the exemplars generated. Our techniques work in an on-line manner and cater to mutually non-exclusive classes which are critical in the collaborative networked computing landscape.

Reference-contexts: Due to space limitations, we are unable to dwell on the intelligent mechanisms in the functioning of PYTHIA. The interested reader is referred to <ref> [9, 4, 7, 2] </ref> for details. <p> A conventional, binary membership function would not model this situation accurately. We feel that such fuzziness is inherent in the learning task whenever agents model complex, real world, scientific problems. In this paper, we use a quantitative measure of reasonableness <ref> [2] </ref> to automatically generate exemplars to learn the mapping described earlier. This is needed because the user cannot be expected to have information about the most reasonable resource (s) for a given problem in such a dynamic scenario.

Reference-contexts: While our studies have utilized standard statistical methods, gradient descent methods, machine learning techniques and other classes of algorithms, it has been our experience that specialized techniques developed for this domain perform better than conventional off-the-shelf approaches <ref> [3] </ref>. In particular, we have designed a neuro-fuzzy technique that infers efficient mappings, caters to mutually non-exclusive classes and learns the classifications in an on-line manner. In order to make this paper self-contained, we provide only those details of this algorithm that are relevant in the current context.

Reference-contexts: The trick is to combine two factors, one which denotes the probability of a proposition q being true, and the other which denotes its utility. Specifically, the reasonableness of a proposition is defined as follows <ref> [5] </ref>: r (q) = p (q)U t (q) + p (~ q)U f (q); where U t (q) denotes the positive utility of accepting q if it is true, U f (q) denotes the negative utility of accepting q if it is false and p (q) be the probability that q

Reference-contexts: Our neuro-fuzzy technique is a supervised learning mechanism that is based on the fuzzy min-max neural network technique proposed by Simpson [8]. This is a variation of the leader cluster algorithm, enhanced with the notion of fuzziness. Similar methods have been proposed by Newton <ref> [6] </ref> and Grossberg et. al.[1]. This method uses fuzzy sets to describe pattern classes. Each fuzzy set is the fuzzy union of several n-dimensional hyperboxes. Learning proceeds by placing and adjusting the hyperboxes in pattern space which causes expansion or contraction of the hyperboxes.
