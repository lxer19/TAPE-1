Reference-contexts: From a scientific perspective, this study has retrospectively resulted in an intriguing collection of diagnosis-and-repair strategies. Scientists have studied diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for a variety of reasons. Many have studied medical decision making with the purpose of educating physicians [114, 42, 79, 39, 81]. Others, <ref> [96, 5, 23] </ref>, have studied such strategies with the objective of eventually teaching them to a machine. Yet others have used them as insights on how to encode medical knowledge in computerized decision support systems, e.g. the systems in [147, 22]. <p> Thus, rather than enumerating all possible reasons (suspected diseases), it is probably simpler to write a rule of the form: Chest Wound (Side=S) &gt; Survey Chest X-Ray 2 Alpay <ref> [5] </ref> separates such strategies as problem refinement strategies, but that terminology may be confusing given that refinement was previously referring to any specialization. 139 The explore strategy [113] can be viewed as a special case of a symptom-based specialization strategy.

Reference-contexts: Given the complexity of planning as search, in both the plans-space and the situation-action space <ref> [14] </ref>, much of the research in that area has focused on ways to reduce search. <p> Many planners, including most of the pioneering work as well as many later domain-independent planners (e.g. <ref> [44, 14, 100] </ref>), make few assumptions on the nature of sub-conjuncts and their interaction with one another. In many of these planners, sub-conjuncts are taken simply as describing various aspects of the goal-state, and are treated equally. <p> In particular, I assume there are no clobberers/white knights <ref> [14] </ref>, nor causal links [100] between actions aimed at different goals. My second assumption is that it is not hard to a priori construct plans to satisfy 6 The framework will actually allow other forms of interaction as well. 78 individual goals; I call these procedures or protocols.

Reference-contexts: Each of these of course has a natural representation; the difficulty arises when tasks have both sorts of knowledge. In mycin, for example, the diagnostic task is fundamentally inferential, but there is also an overall seven-step procedure that structures the diagnosis <ref> [24] </ref>. The difficulty of dealing with both forms of knowledge at once is displayed by mycin's relatively obscure solution to the problem: it produces the seven steps as a side-effect of the backward chaining process and several carefully constructed rules.

Reference-contexts: In particular, two distinctions which are currently regarded by the community as very important are: 1. what is formalized, i.e. is it human expertise that is modeled, or is it the function of the diagnosed device (model-based <ref> [29] </ref>); and 2. the formalization method, i.e. discrete (e.g. rules, consistency-based, abduc-tive, etc), or probabilistic (e.g. Bayesian classification, influence diagrams, decision- or utility-theoretic, etc.).

Reference-contexts: These procedures can be com-puted on-line, as in [94, 109] for example, or simply pre-specified. I take planning to be the problem of combining individual plans into a single efficient plan (see also <ref> [48] </ref>). Most importantly, my third assumption is that the domain of application can often indicate certain constraints and preferences. <p> Localization is often domain-specific, and one may therefore have to rely on an expert's intimate knowledge of the domain. More generally, the use of localized strategies in the proposed methodology is a simple matter of divide-and-conquer and so it can also accommodate automatically generated sub-plans (as in <ref> [162, 94, 48] </ref>), as well as combinations of automatically generated sub-plans and explicitly specified sub-strategies. An important distinction of our local strategies is that while inference-responses are 2 To be precise, rules enumerate equivalence classes on states.

Reference-contexts: I have argued that diagnosis and repair are often inseparable in exploratory-corrective domains. GDD is therefore proposed as part of a total approach. Recent work by Friedrich et al. <ref> [51] </ref> and Sun and Weld [149] shares much of this view. Friedrich et al.'s theory, for example, has no explicit notion of a diagnosis object.

Sun and Weld use uwl, a strips-like language, in an approach which integrates gde-style diagnosis and strips-style planning.

Reference-contexts: Some sequential frameworks use a cost measure to model the effect of actions. However, as noted by Genesereth <ref> [54] </ref>, this approach is way too simplistic. In this work, rather than worrying about more accurate models of action, I claim that if properly integrated diagnostic research can simply rely on planning research.

Reference-contexts: Ginsberg's Multi-Valued Logics (MVL) is a formal framework for inference in which each proposition is assigned not only a truth value, corresponding to the strength of belief in that proposition being true or false, but also a knowledge assessment, measuring roughly the amount of knowledge used in deriving this belief <ref> [58] </ref>. Bilattices in which one partial order corresponds to the truthfulness measure and the other to the knowledge assessment are used in MVL as domains. My first formalization of GDD [135] used a three-valued logic: true, false and unknown. <p> Besides fitting my needs, I believe that the specialized theory may be useful for others wishing to convert other rule-based systems to MVL. While the material presented next is self-contained, the reader is referred to <ref> [58] </ref> for a more complete coverage of MVL. 3.3.2 Attitude and Belief During the diagnostic process, the GDD reasoner will maintain and update an attitude and a belief for a set of propositional statements. <p> The basic form of inference, presented next, is simpler and more intuitive than that in <ref> [58] </ref>. In Section 3.4, I extend it to a form that is closer to Ginsberg's in order to support reasoning about 38 contradictory information. <p> The extended form of inference presented next is a specialization of his approach to the propositional rule-based case. 3.4.3 Inference Inference must now be redefined to allow for rules that explicitly falsify a proposition and for the need to combine positive and negative contributions. In <ref> [58] </ref>, the full first-order formulation of MVL assigns to a statement a truth-value that combines the results of all possible proofs for that statement and its negation. Theoretically, such determination may be undecidable; in practice, it may often be cumbersome. <p> In particular, a finer partition of the belief and attitude bilattice can support a finer reasoning by the planner about the relative relevance and current degrees of satisfaction of competing goals. As noted in Section 3.8, fairly detailed default bilattices can be constructed. Ginsberg <ref> [58] </ref> discusses possible-worlds-based bilattices. Unfortunately, if done by hand, the model-building process which is cumbersome to begin with, becomes even more so with complex bilattices. Such extensions, however, can maybe be useful if models can be built automatically (see Section 8.2.4).

Reference-contexts: to transformations that take one plan structure and transform it into another (e.g. add or remove action, impose or change order, refine the detail, etc. 1 ) Alternatively, planning can also be viewed as search in a space of world state descriptions, connected with edges representing world state transformations (e.g. <ref> [101, 88, 59, 161] </ref>). While in the context of planning action-based transformations are clearly of special interest, other operators may also be relevant.

Reference-contexts: Once programmed, it is easier for a machine to produce and consider an exhaustive set of hypotheses. A machine is also less prone to human weaknesses such as limited ability to consider more than a few hypotheses [102]; premature closure [81]; and poor ability to reason with probabilities <ref> [77] </ref>. In GDD, goal-setting rules can be used to trigger new hypotheses in the form of "relevant" facts.

Reference-contexts: For example, one that minimizes risk or cost, maximizes the likelihood of success, etc. Presented at this level of abstraction, this problem resembles many abduction problems, e.g. abductive explanation and diagnosis [129, 119, 11, 28, 97].

Reference-contexts: From a scientific perspective, this study has retrospectively resulted in an intriguing collection of diagnosis-and-repair strategies. Scientists have studied diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for a variety of reasons. Many have studied medical decision making with the purpose of educating physicians <ref> [114, 42, 79, 39, 81] </ref>. Others, [96, 5, 23], have studied such strategies with the objective of eventually teaching them to a machine. Yet others have used them as insights on how to encode medical knowledge in computerized decision support systems, e.g. the systems in [147, 22]. <p> This process was observed in clinicians by Kassirer and Gorry <ref> [79] </ref>: "Requesting and assessing new information, they rejected some of the initial hypotheses, substituted specific hypotheses for more general ones, and selected a few specific hypotheses for detailed and critical testing". Similar observations were made by other researchers [42].

Reference-contexts: Utility theory tells us that for such a decision to be optimal, it should maximize the expected utility as measured by preferences over possible outcomes. Indeed, utilities have been used extensively in medical decision making (see <ref> [80, 116] </ref>). While some sort of utility considerations can be identified in each of the above strategies, as well as their instantiations in TraumAID 2.0, utilities are not explicitly represented in 148 TraumAID 5 .
