Abstract: There is strong evidence that face processing in the brain is localized. The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and visual object agnosia, difficulty recognizing other kinds of complex objects, indicates that face and non-face object recognition may be served by partially independent neural mechanisms. In this chapter, we use computational models to show how the face processing specialization apparently underlying prosopagnosia and visual object agnosia could be attributed to 1) a relatively simple competitive selection mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing, 2) the developing infant's need to perform subordinate classification (identification) of faces early on, and 3) the infant's low visual acuity at birth. Inspired by de Schonen and Mancini's (1998) arguments that factors like these could bias the visual system to develop a specialized face processor, and Jacobs and Kosslyn's (1994) experiments in the mixtures of experts (ME) modeling paradigm, we provide a preliminary computational demonstration of how this theory accounts for the double dissociation between face and object processing. We present two feed-forward computational models of visual processing. In both models, the selection mechanism is a gating network that mediates a competition between modules attempting to classify input stimuli. In Model I, when the modules are simple unbiased classifiers, the competition is sufficient to achieve enough of a specialization that damaging one module impairs the model's face recognition more than its object recognition, and damaging the other module impairs the model's object recognition more than its face recognition. In Model II, however, we bias the modules by providing one with low spatial frequency information and the other with high spatial frequency information. In this case, when the model's task is subordinate classification of faces and superordinate classification of objects, the low spatial frequency network shows an even stronger specialization for faces. No other combination of tasks and inputs shows this strong specialization. We take these results as support for the idea that something resembling a face processing "module" could arise as a natural consequence of the infant's developmental environment without being innately specified.

Reference-contexts: Although it is difficult to assess exactly what is impaired and what is preserved (researchers obviously cannot test patients on all objects), Farah's (1990) review cites many such cases. Perhaps the most dramatically impaired and well-known visual agnosic without prosopagnosia is C.K. <ref> (Behrmann et al., 1994) </ref>. This patient has a striking deficit in part integration; he can identify the component parts of objects but cannot put them together to recognize the whole.

Thus the Gabor wavelet jet is a good representation for face recognition. We use a simple version of the square mesh <ref> (Buhmann et al., 1990) </ref> as described below. Since we use prealigned images and phase-invariant filter responses, the more complicated fiducial point techniques are unnecessary.

Reference-contexts: We limit discussion here to so-called "associative" prosopagnosics, who perform normally on face matching and face detection tasks but cannot recognize the identity of familiar faces <ref> (De Renzi, 1986) </ref>. This condition is usually associated with either unilateral right hemisphere or bilateral lesions in the fusiform gyrus area. For reviews that include lesion locations, see Farah (1990) and De Renzi et al. (1994).

Reference-contexts: Associative visual agnosia sparing face recognition is normally associated with left occipital or bilateral occipital lesions and usually coincides with alexia, in which patients have difficulty reading because they cannot rapidly piece letters into words <ref> (Farah, 1990) </ref>. It seems to reflect an impairment in decomposing complex objects into parts (Feinberg et al., 1994). Although it is difficult to assess exactly what is impaired and what is preserved (researchers obviously cannot test patients on all objects), Farah's (1990) review cites many such cases.

Reference-contexts: Martha Farah and her colleagues have performed two important experiments providing further evidence that face processing can be impaired with little impact on within-category discrimination of objects. In the first, they constructed a within-class discrimination task involving faces and visually similar eyeglasses <ref> (Farah et al., 1995a) </ref>. Normal subjects were significantly better at discriminating the faces than the eyeglasses, but the prosopagnosic patient L.H. did not show this effect.

Reference-contexts: His face discrimination performance was significantly lower than that of the control group, but his eyeglass discrimination performance was comparable to that of the controls. In the other experiment, the researchers compared L.H.'s performance in recognizing inverted faces to that of normals <ref> (Farah et al., 1995b) </ref>. The surprising result was that whereas normal subjects were significantly better at recognizing upright faces than inverted ones, L.H. performed normally on the inverted faces but was actually worse at recognizing the upright faces than the inverted ones.

Reference-contexts: review the behavioral distinctions between face processing and general object processing. 1.2 How does face recognition differ from general object recognition? Since the neuropsychological data indicate that there is something special about faces, perhaps the most debated issue in the field is whether there is an innate, mandatory, domain-specific module <ref> (Fodor, 1983) </ref> for face processing. Moscovitch et al. (1997), for instance, give a convincing argument for modularity based on their experiments with C.K., the object agnosic.

Reference-contexts: But it appears that the acquisition of expertise in subordinate classification of a novel synthetic object class, "greebles," leads to a similar sensitivity to configuration information <ref> (Gauthier and Tarr, 1997) </ref>. Gauthier et al. (1998) have also observed in fMRI studies that expert-level greeble classification activates an area in fusiform gyrus thought by some to be specialized for faces (Sergent et al., 1992; McCarthy et al., 1997).

Reference-contexts: in a given network could be interpreted as representing, for instance, analogous regions in the left and right hemispheres, or two nearby relatively independent processing units in the same region of the brain. 2.2 The network architectures The first model's network architecture is the well-known "mixture of experts" (ME) network <ref> (Jacobs et al., 1991) </ref>. The ME network contains a population of simple linear classifiers (the "experts") whose outputs are mixed by a "gating" network. During learning, the experts compete to classify each input training pattern, and the gating network directs more error information (feedback) to the expert that performs best. <p> The network model was a mixture of experts <ref> (Jacobs et al., 1991) </ref>. Figure 2 (a) shows our two-expert network schematically, and Appendix A describes the network and its learning rules in detail.

Reference-contexts: Experiments exploring the development of face recognition abilities in human infants have also provided important clues to the organization of the putative face processing system and how that organization arises. Experiments have shown that at birth, an infant's visual attention is spontaneously directed toward face-like stimuli <ref> (Johnson et al., 1991) </ref>. An infant can visually discriminate between his or her mother's face Dailey & Cottrell 4 and a stranger's face, but only external features such as hairline and head contours are salient to the task at an early age (Pascalis et al., 1995). <p> Indeed, Dailey & Cottrell 11 standard error. as discussed earlier, such constraints, such as the prevalence of face stimuli in the newborn's environment, different maturation rates in different areas of the brain, and a possibly innate preference for tracking faces, may well be at work during infant development <ref> (Johnson and Morton, 1991) </ref>. Despite the lack of a strong face/non-face separation in the network, damaging the "face expert" affects face recognition accuracy disproportionately, compared with how damage to the non-face expert affects object recognition accuracy.

Reference-contexts: It is not clear whether the infant's shift to the use of internal features for distinguishing his or her mother from strangers represents the use of an entirely new system or a gradual refinement of the old system <ref> (Johnson, 1997) </ref>. But the experimental data on the development of face recognition capabilities make it seem likely that the infant visual system begins training a cortical "face processor" utilizing external facial features very early on.

Reference-contexts: The Gabor wavelet resembles a sinusoid restricted by a Gaussian function, may be tuned to a particular orientation and spatial frequency, and is similar to the observed receptive fields of Dailey & Cottrell 8 simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex <ref> (Jones and Palmer, 1987) </ref>. A "jet" is formed by concatenating the response of several filters with different orientation and spatial frequency tunings. As an image feature detector, the jet exhibits some invariance to background, translation, distortion, and size (Buhmann et al., 1990).
