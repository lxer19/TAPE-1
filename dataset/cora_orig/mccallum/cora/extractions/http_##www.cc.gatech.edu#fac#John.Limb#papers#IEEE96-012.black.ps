Abstract: We study variations on the approach proposed by COM21's contribution to the IEEE 802.14 working group in [1] to re-register stations after a geographic power failure. This paper reports the results of a comparative study of various Contention Resolution Algorithms (CRA) that might be used in the registration process.

Reference-contexts: This assumption falls within the problem specifications as long as the frame size is greater than the round-trip delay. This is equivalent to assuming that only one slot per frame is used for the acquisition process (see <ref> [1] </ref>) . 2.2 Contention Resolution Algorithms 2.2.1 p-persistence In p-persistence the station decides whether or not to transmit independently at each frame. The parameter p (0 &lt; p 1) defines the probability of retransmission, so (1 p) is the probability of backoff for a frame.
