Abstract: The electronic representation of scientific documents: journals, technical reports, program documentation, laboratory notebooks, etc. present challenges in several distinct communities. We see five distinct groups concerned with electronic versions of scientific documents: We need to have a convergence in design and standards for encoding new or preexisting (typically paper-based) documents in order to most efficiently meet the needs of all these groups. Various efforts, some loosely coordinated, but just as often competing, are trying to set standards and build tools. We approach this by first dividing the task into visual, syntactic, and semantic components. These specifications can focus attention on the addressing requirements of the different groups. Additionally, these components rely on a structure for documents that incorporates existing library models and extends them to new modes of operation. Berkeley's MVD is one plausible structure which will allow prototype development and explorations.
