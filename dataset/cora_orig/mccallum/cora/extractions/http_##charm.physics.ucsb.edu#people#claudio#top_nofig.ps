Abstract: Evidence for pair production of a new particle consistent with the Standard Model top quark has been reported recently by groups studying proton anti-proton collisions at 1.8 TeV center of mass energy at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. In this paper we review the history of the search for the top quark in electron positron and proton anti-proton collisions. We report on a number of precise electro-weak measurements and the value of the top quark mass which can be extracted from these measurements within the context of the Standard Model. We review the theoretical predictions for top quark production and the dominant backgrounds. We describe the collider and the detectors that were used to measure the pair production process and follow on to describe the data from which the existence of the top quark is evinced. Finally, we present possible measurements that could be made in the future with more data, measurements of quantities that would confirm the nature of this particle, the details of its production in hadron collisions, and its decay properties.

Reference-contexts: A lower limit of M top &gt; 131 GeV/c 2 at the 95 % C.L. was established by D0 from the Run Ia data with an integrated luminosity of 13.5 pb 1 <ref> (Abachi et al., 1994) </ref>. Initial evidence for the top quark was reported by the CDF collaboration (F. Abe et al., 1994a) based on analysis of the Run Ia data set only, which had an integrated luminosity of 19.3 pb 1 . <p> Electron energy (GeV) and muon momentum (GeV/c) resolutions in the central region for the UA1 (Albajar et al., 1989), UA2 (Alitti et al., 1992a), CDF (F. Abe et al., 1994a), and D0 <ref> (Abachi et al., 1994) </ref> detectors. The UA1 muon momentum resolution is for measurements in the central-detector, for muons at 90 o from the direction of the dipole field. The UA1 electron energy resolution changed between 1983 and 1985 due to radiation damage of the scintillator.

Reference-contexts: Following the publication of a lower limit on M top , the D0 requirements were reoptimized, i.e. tightened, for higher top masses. With the optimized requirements, a statistically not very significant 60 excess of events (1.9 standard deviations) was also found in the Run Ia D0 data <ref> (Abachi et al., 1995a and 1995d) </ref>. With the addition of the data from the first half of Run Ib, a statistically convincing excess of events emerged from the analyses of the data sets from both collaborations (F. Abe et al., 1995a; Abachi et al., 1995b).

Reference-contexts: This approach results in a test of the QCD calculation of top production, and is sensitive to possible non-Standard Model production mechanisms for top quarks, see the discussion in Section X. Both CDF (F. Abe et al., 1994a and 1995a) and D0 <ref> (Abachi et al., 1995b) </ref> have reported direct measurements of the top mass from lepton + jets data and these will be reviewed in Section IX.A. <p> CDF (F.

Reference-contexts: The degree of confidence in these LO calculations is such that the theoretical predictions have been used to extract the value of ff s from the W + jet data (Lindgren, 1992; Alitti et al., 1991c). More recent measurements of ff s <ref> (Abachi et al., 1995c) </ref> have been based on the full NLO (order ff s ) calculation for pp ! W (Giele, Glover, and Kosower, 1993).

Reference-contexts: As a result of 6 E T studies in the multijet sample, the fraction of Z ! ee events with 6 E T &gt; 40 GeV is estimated to be less than 2 x 10 4 <ref> (Abachi et al., 1995d) </ref>. The CDF requirement is more conservative and loses acceptance in return for certainty that there will be no Z decays in the top candidate sample.

Reference-contexts: The integrated luminosity was 4 pb 1 . The cross-section limits are a function of the top mass because the t t acceptance depends on the top mass.

Reference-contexts: The CDF collaboration searched for top in both the lepton + jets (see Section V.E) and dilepton (see Section V.D) modes. The CDF top search in the isolated electron + 2 jets channel <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1990a and 1991a) </ref> was qualitatively similar to the UA2 search. An explicit 6 E T requirement was imposed, yielding a data sample containing W ! e- + 2 jets events, with a small contamination from semileptonic band c-quark decays, as well as fake electrons. <p> From the UA2 collaboration, Akesson et al., 1990.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the influence of the theoretical modelling of the background was minimized in the CDF and UA2 lepton + jets top searches. The CDF collaboration also searched for t t production in the dilepton channel. Initially, only the e channel was considered <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1990b) </ref>. As discussed in Section V.D, the t t dilepton signature consists in principle of two isolated high P T leptons, 6 E T and two jets.

Reference-contexts: The mass region 28 &lt; M top &lt; 72 GeV/c 2 was excluded at the 95% C.L. A subsequent CDF search <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1992a) </ref> in the dilepton channel, based on the same integrated luminosity of 4 pb 1 , also included the ee and channels, resulting in an increase in the top acceptance by a factor of two. <p> The CDF experiment also searched for top-quarks in the electron or muon + 2 jets channel, where the dominant W + jets background was reduced by attempting to tag b-quarks through their semileptonic decay into muons, b ! or b ! c ! <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1992a) </ref>. No events consistent with the top hypothesis were found.

Reference-contexts: A lower limit of M top &gt; 131 GeV/c 2 at the 95 % C.L. was established by D0 from the Run Ia data with an integrated luminosity of 13.5 pb 1 (Abachi et al., 1994). Initial evidence for the top quark was reported by the CDF collaboration <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1994a) </ref> based on analysis of the Run Ia data set only, which had an integrated luminosity of 19.3 pb 1 . The excess in the number of top candidate events over the background prediction was 2.8 standard deviations. <p> Analyses of the kinematic properties of lepton + jets events were also performed on the CDF data <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1994a, 1995b, and 1995c) </ref>. Excesses of top-like events were also seen in these CDF studies, and were used to confirm the results of the b-tagging observations. <p> For example, 72 if the CDF backgrounds were to be calculated using the best theoretical input for W Q Q, the background estimate would have been reduced by only about 10%, independently of jet multiplicity <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1994a) </ref>. This is well within the 20% systematic uncertainty assigned to the background calculation. The sizes of the excesses of events seen by the two collaborations are loosely consistent with expectations for t t. <p> If the CDF requirement were to be raised to 4 GeV/c, the background would be reduced by a factor of 1.8, while the tagging efficiency for M top &gt; 130 GeV/c 2 would be lowered by approximately 20% only <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1994a) </ref>. An excess of events in the CDF lepton tag analysis is also present when the minimum P T requirement is raised to 4 GeV/c. In this case, 15 tags in 14 events are observed, with a background of 8.7 1.8 tags (Kestenbaum, 1996). 3. <p> Since the vertex detector is only 51 cm long, approximately 40% of the interactions occur outside its geometrical coverage. Note that the tagging efficiency reported in the first CDF publications on vertex tagging in top events <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1994a) </ref> was considerably smaller, * tag = (22 6)%. This value of the tagging efficiency was underestimated by 15%, due to a mistake in the Monte Carlo simulation. <p> This is especially true in light of the fact that two out of the three Z+ 3 jets events collected by CDF during run Ia contained one vertex-tagged jet <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1994a) </ref>. The results of the tagging algorithms on Z+ jets events are displayed in Table XIII. With the higher luminosity data sample, the number of tags in the Z+ jets data is fully consistent with the background expectations, within the limited statistics. <p> Also, for both experiments the separate cross-section measurements in the different channels are nicely consistent with each other. The CDF measurement is lower than, although still consistent with, the cross-section value of 13.9 +6:1 4:8 pb obtained from the analysis of the first 19 pb 1 of CDF data <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1994a) </ref>. Both the CDF and D0 t t cross-section measurements are in agreement with the theoretical prediction. To summarize, both collaborations have not only reported excesses of top-like events in several different channels, but the sizes of these excesses are also consistent with each other. <p> This approach results in a test of the QCD calculation of top production, and is sensitive to possible non-Standard Model production mechanisms for top quarks, see the discussion in Section X. Both CDF <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1994a and 1995a) </ref> and D0 (Abachi et al., 1995b) have reported direct measurements of the top mass from lepton + jets data and these will be reviewed in Section IX.A. <p> Its measurement tests the predictive power of QCD and is sensitive to new physics. Considerable theoretical interest in the subject was triggered by the initial measurement of the t t cross-section by the CDF collaboration <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1994a) </ref>. The measured value was higher than expected, although still consistent with the QCD calculation, within the large experimental uncertainties. The more recent higher statistics measurement by both CDF and D0 are in better agreement with the calculation (see Fig. 92). <p> Electron energy (GeV) and muon momentum (GeV/c) resolutions in the central region for the UA1 (Albajar et al., 1989), UA2 (Alitti et al., 1992a), CDF <ref> (F.

Reference-contexts: It should be emphasized that top production is a very rare process in pp collisions. The total inelastic cross-section at the Tevatron is approximately 60 mb <ref> (F. Abe et al., 1994b) </ref>, ten orders of magnitude higher than (t t) for M top = 175 GeV/c 2 . Therefore, in trying to isolate a top signal, both excellent background rejection and high luminosities are critical.

Abe et al., 1995b) </ref> relies on the fact that jets in t t events are more central than jets in W + jets. <p> However, if one assumes that there are no t t events in the sample, this bias is not sufficient to account for the concentration of tagged events at high values of H. The second CDF kinematic analysis of lepton + jets data, <ref> (cos fl analysis, F. Abe et al., 1995b) </ref>, is based on the fact that jets in top events are expected to be more central than in W + jets events (Cobal, Grassman, and Leone, 1994).

Reference-contexts: A better limit on the top-quark mass was also obtained at the same time by the UA2 collaboration, based on an integrated luminosity of 7.5 pb 1 at the SppS <ref> (Akesson et al., 1990) </ref>. Without muon detection capabilities, the UA2 results were based entirely on the electron + 1 jet channel. The UA2 search strategy differed considerably from that of UA1, with a 6 E T &gt; 15 GeV and an electron isolation requirement imposed in the event selection.

Reference-contexts: The excess of events over the background prediction was also consistent with the expected top production cross-section, providing further evidence for a top quark with M top 40 GeV/c 2 . These first results were however not supported by a subsequent UA1 analysis <ref> (Albajar et al., 1988) </ref>, with a higher statistics data sample, as well as a more complete evaluation of the backgrounds. This analysis was based on samples of events with one isolated muon + 2 jets or one isolated electron + 1 jet. The integrated luminosity was 700 nb 1 . <p> Because of the missing EM calorimeter, only + 2 jets and final states were considered. The + jets analysis was essentially an extension of the previous UA1 search <ref> (Albajar et al., 1988) </ref>, with the maximum transverse mass requirement raised to 60 GeV/c 2 . For each event, a likelihood-like variable (L 1 ) was defined to discriminate between top and background on an average basis.

Reference-contexts: In the US, the first high-luminosity (up to 2 x 10 30 cm 2 s 1 ) run of the Tevatron Collider also started in 1988, with the CDF detector ready for data-taking. The 1988-89 UA1 top search <ref> (Albajar et al., 1990) </ref> was based on an integrated luminosity of 4.7 pb 1 , a factor of seven higher than had been previously available. Because of the missing EM calorimeter, only + 2 jets and final states were considered.

Reference-contexts: In the case of top quarks, the decay products include neutrinos and hadron jets. The first example of the reconstruction of resonances using jets was UA2's 88 observation of a bump consistent with the W and Z in the jet-jet invariant mass distribu-tion <ref> (Alitti et al., 1991a) </ref>. In this case there was an an enormous background from QCD production of jets not involving a vector boson. The field of jet-spectroscopy is still in its infancy, although much progress has been made in the past year. 1.

Reference-contexts: At the time that these results were obtained, only a LO calculation for pp ! t t was available. Using a conservative value for this cross-section the limit was inferred to be M top &gt; 44 GeV/c 2 at the 95% confidence level.

Reference-contexts: If we assume that the Standard Model can be used to correctly calculate higher order electro-weak processes, we can infer the top quark mass by comparing these calculations to precise measurements <ref> (Altarelli, Kleiss, and Verzegnassi, 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the search strategies in the lepton + jets channel were quite different. At the beginning of Run Ia, a silicon vertex detector was installed at CDF <ref> (Amidei et al., 1994) </ref>. Given the excellent b-tagging capabilities of this device (see Section V.E.4), b-tagging was used to separate the top signal in the lepton + jets channel from the W + jets background. <p> CDF is the first, and so far the only, experiment to operate such a detector in a hadron collider. The first silicon vertex detector (SVX) at CDF was installed in 1992 prior to the beginning of Run Ia. The SVX <ref> (Amidei et al., 1994) </ref> is a four-layer cylindrical detector which is 51 cm long. The four layers are at distances of 3.0, 4.2, 5.7, and 7.9 cm from the beamline.

Reference-contexts: In this Section we will concentrate on prospects for top physics at the Tevatron. We will begin by briefly summarizing plans for the upgrade of the accelerator and the detectors in Section X.A. Detailed studies of the possibilities for the Tevatron top physics program are well under way <ref> (Amidei and Brock, 1996) </ref>. <p> of the t t samples in each experiment for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb 1 will be of order 100 events in the dilepton channel and of order 500 events in the lepton + 4 jets channel with one b-tag, with half of these events having both b-jets tagged <ref> (Amidei and Brock, 1996) </ref>. In addition, towards the middle of the next decade, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will become operational. The LHC is a very high luminosity (&gt; 10 34 cm 2 s 1 ) pp machine with p s = 14 TeV. <p> The number of signal events for jV tb j 1 would be of order 120 per fb 1 , resulting in a statistical uncertainty in the cross-section measurement of order 17% in a 1 fb 1 data set <ref> (Amidei and Brock, 110 1996) </ref>. An additional study, optimized for the detection of the Drell-Yan q q ! W fl ! t b process, suggests that with the requirement of a double b-tag the signal can be isolated, (see Fig. 109 Stelzer and Willenbrock, 1995). <p> The statistical sensitivity for this branching ratio measurement is projected to be 3% for a 1 fb 1 exposure <ref> (Amidei and Brock, 1996) </ref>. Top decays also provide a unique opportunity to test the the structure of the charged weak current at the t ! W b vertex. Because the top quark is so heavy, it is possible that 111 new physics may manifest itself at the W tb vertex. <p> These polarizations can be measured from the angle of emission of the lepton in W -decays. Studies indicate that the statistical accuracies in the measurements of 0 and + in an exposure of 1 fb 1 at the Tevatron should be 112 5% and 2% respectively <ref> (Amidei and Brock, 1996) </ref>. These form factors can also be probed by measuring the single top production cross-section (Carlson, Malkawi, and Yuan, 1994; Malkawi and Yuan, 1994).

In order to properly simulate the response of the detector, hadronization effects are included by interfacing the VECBOS event generator with hadronization models based e.g., on independent parton-fragmentation <ref> (Field and Feynman, 1978) </ref>, or the HERWIG model (Marchesini and Webber, 1984 and 1988).

FIG. 77: An idealized sketch of vertex tagging in the transverse plane. The tracks from the primary vertex (a) are used to improve on the accuracy of the determination of the position of the primary vertex.

Reference-contexts: The two processes are modeled with the ISAJET (for t t) and VECBOS (for W + jets) event generators. The ISAJET model employed here does not include initial and final state gluon radiation effects; the t t rates are normalized to a recent pp ! t t cross-section calculation <ref> (Laenen, Smith, and van Neerven, 1994) </ref>. <p> This limit was extracted using the NLO calculation of the t t cross-section (Ellis, 1991). The 91 GeV/c 2 limit corresponds to the point where the cross-section limit curve crosses the lower (i.e. more pessimistic) bound of the theoretical prediction. Using a more up-to-date calculation of (t t) <ref> (Laenen, Smith, and van Neerven, 1994) </ref>, would result in a limit of 95 GeV/c 2 . The lower limits on the top mass from the UA1, UA2, and CDF experiments are summarized in Table VI. <p> CDF and D0 lepton + jets requirements for the b-tag analysis. The variable H T in D0 is defined as the scalar sum of the E T of all the jets.

Reference-contexts: D. Modelling of top quark production The reliability of the modeling of t t production in is an important issue. Top production is usually modelled using a QCD shower Monte Carlo program, such as ISAJET (Paige and Protopopescu, 1986), HERWIG <ref> (Marchesini and Webber, 1984 and 1988) </ref> or PYTHIA (Sjostrand and Bengtsson, 1987). These Monte Carlos are used by the experimental groups to calculate the t t acceptance and kinematics, and to model the resolution of the top quark mass measurement, see Section IX. <p> In order to properly simulate the response of the detector, hadronization effects are included by interfacing the VECBOS event generator with hadronization models based e.g., on independent parton-fragmentation (Field and Feynman, 1978), or the HERWIG model <ref> (Marchesini and Webber, 1984 and 1988) </ref>. A model of the underlying event also needs to be included. In what follows we will show several comparisons of theoretical expectations for t t and W + jets at Tevatron energies.

Reference-contexts: The pole mass of the b-quark is estimated to be in the range 4.5 - 4.9 GeV/c 2 from knowledge of the and b-meson masses <ref> (Montanet et al., 1994) </ref>. The weak isospin of the b-quark was first extracted from the forward-backward asymmetry (A F B ) in e + e ! b b. <p> Measurements of the Z width at the LEP and SLC colliders rule out the existence of a 4th generation neutrino with mass M - &lt; ~ M Z /2 <ref> (Montanet et al., 1994) </ref>. Unless the 4th generation neutrino is very massive, no additional generations are allowed in the context of 7 the Standard Model. The top quark is therefore the last fermion expected in the Standard Model. <p> They are suppressed by factors of jV ts j 2 =jV tb j 2 10 3 and jV td j 2 =jV tb j 2 5 x 10 4 respectively, where V ij is a Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing-matrix element <ref> (Montanet et al., 1994) </ref>. The expected width of the top quark, and hence the lifetime, as a function of its mass, is shown in Fig. 24. The hadronization process, which is non-perturbative in nature, is not well understood. <p> Short lived particles are made to decay, with branching ratios and decay models based on the compilation from the Particle Data Group <ref> (Montanet et al., 1994) </ref>. The main differences between these Monte Carlo event generators reside in the modeling of the radiation processes. <p> There are two ways to detect the presence of b-quarks. The first method is based on the detection of additional leptons from the semileptonic decays b ! cl- or b ! c ! sl-. The semileptonic branching ratios of bottom and charm quarks are approximately 10% per lepton species <ref> (Montanet et al., 1994) </ref>. There is on average about one lepton (electron + muon) from b or c decay in each top event, where we have also included the contributions from c-quarks from W ! cs, which occurs in one half of all hadronic W decays. <p> The value of the Z leptonic branching ratio is taken from the very precise measurements in e + e annhilations at LEP and SLC <ref> (Montanet et al., 1994) </ref>. <p> Hence, only indirect measurements of (t ! W b) and jV tb j can be performed. Assuming three generations and unitarity of the CKM matrix, the value of jV tb j is expected to be very near unity, in the range 0.99880.9995 <ref> (Montanet et al., 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This will be crucial to allow for more precise measurements of the top mass. We will discuss a number of possible approaches in Section X. 97 4. Updated CDF and D0 top mass measurements As this review article was being completed, both the CDF (Tartarelli, 1996) and D0 <ref> (Narain, 1996) </ref> top mass results have been updated. In both experiments, the statistical errors have decreased due to the larger data samples and, more importantly, the systematic uncertainties have been reduced as a result of more detailed studies of the jet energy scales in the two experiments. <p> Measurements of the t t invariant mass distributions are possible in the lepton + jets channel. Preliminary CDF (Yao, 1995) and D0 <ref> (Narain, 1996) </ref> analyses are consistent with QCD expectations, (see Fig. 111). With the high statistics that will become available, these models will be critically tested in the future.

Reference-contexts: These features of t t production can be simply understood from the properties of the i + j ! t t process. The cross-section for the q q ! t t subprocess, which dominates at high top mass, is given at lowest order by <ref> (see for example Nason, Dawson, and Ellis, 1988) </ref> : ^ = s s 4M 2 ^s 2M 2 ^s The parton-parton cross-section as a function of ^s rises from zero at threshold (^s = 4M 2 top ), reaches a maximum at ^s = 5:6M 2 top , and then falls <p> Using a conservative value for this cross-section the limit was inferred to be M top &gt; 44 GeV/c 2 at the 95% confidence level. A subsequent re-evaluation (Altarelli et al., 1988), based on the NLO calculation of heavy-quark pair-production <ref> (Nason, Dawson, and Ellis, 1988) </ref> resulted in a slightly modified lower limit M top &gt; 41 GeV/c 2 . This limit is obtained from the t t cross-section corresponding to the lower range of the theoretical prediction.

Reference-contexts: The fragmentation of the b-quark produced in top decay could potentially be more seriously affected. This is because the color string would link the b-quark to the light quark produced in the top fragmentation rather than the proton or anti-proton remnant <ref> (Orr, 1991) </ref>. However, all top-quark experimental studies to date have not been precise enough to be sensitive to fragmentation assumptions. C.

Reference-contexts: tree-level W -gluon fusion cross-section has been calculated by several authors (Willenbrock and Dicus, 1986; Yuan, 1990; Anselmo, van Eijk, and Bordes, 1992; Ellis and Parke, 1992; Bordes and van Eijk, 1993); the cross sections shown in Figs. 21 and 22 are obtained using the PYTHIA Monte Carlo event generator <ref> (Sjostrand and Bengtsson, 1987) </ref>. Since the W -gluon fusion matrix element is calculated at tree level, the systematic uncertainties on the absolute rate prediction can be large, see for example Ellis and Parke, 1992. <p> D. Modelling of top quark production The reliability of the modeling of t t production in is an important issue. Top production is usually modelled using a QCD shower Monte Carlo program, such as ISAJET (Paige and Protopopescu, 1986), HERWIG (Marchesini and Webber, 1984 and 1988) or PYTHIA <ref> (Sjostrand and Bengtsson, 1987) </ref>. These Monte Carlos are used by the experimental groups to calculate the t t acceptance and kinematics, and to model the resolution of the top quark mass measurement, see Section IX.

Reference-contexts: By removing this requirement, however, the background contribution is enhanced. The number of events increases from 14 to 27; 24 of these have at least one combination with good 2 <ref> (Snyder, 1995a) </ref>. As discussed in Section V.B and illustrated in Fig. 33, in t t ! lepton + jets events there is a significant probability for two quarks in the final state to merge into a single jet.

Reference-contexts: In order to measure the 99 top mass, additional information need to be included. Possibilities include the Standard Model V-A expectations for the angular distributions in the top decay chain, or theoretical expectations for the kinematic properties of the produced t and t. The D0 collaboration <ref> (Snyder, 1995b) </ref> recently reported a preliminary measurement of the top mass from dilepton events. The D0 dilepton mass measurement uses five dilepton events. It is based on a data sample with a higher integrated luminosity than the D0 dilepton top search described in Section VIII.A which yielded three candidate events.

Reference-contexts: The two outlying events are most likely due to cases where one of the untagged jets considered to be from the W is really a gluon jet from initial or final state radiation. The D0 hadronic W mass reconstruction procedure <ref> (Strovink, 1995) </ref> in lepton + jets events is much more complicated, since the b-tag in D0 is not as efficient as in CDF. The analysis uses lepton + 4 jets data, and considers only the four jets with the highest E T .

Reference-contexts: This will be crucial to allow for more precise measurements of the top mass. We will discuss a number of possible approaches in Section X. 97 4. Updated CDF and D0 top mass measurements As this review article was being completed, both the CDF <ref> (Tartarelli, 1996) </ref> and D0 (Narain, 1996) top mass results have been updated. <p> A measurement of the top mass based on the b-quark transverse momentum spectrum or the b-lepton invariant mass, is almost entirely independent of initial state radiation in t t events. The CDF collaboration has also reported measurements of the top mass based on kinematic distributions in both dilepton events <ref> (Tartarelli, 1996) </ref> and lepton + jets events (F. Abe et al., 1995c). The dilepton mass determination is based on a fit to the jet E T spectrum in these events and yields M top = 159 +24 22 (stat.)17 (syst.) GeV/c 2 . <p> CDF <ref> (Tartarelli, 1996) </ref> and D0 (Narain, 1996; Klima, 1996) measurements of (pp ! t t) at a center-of-mass energy of 1.8 TeV.

Reference-contexts: Note that it is extremely difficult to get the scale information from inclusive W decays to two jets, because of the very high QCD di-jet background which would both mask the signal and saturate the data acquisition bandwidth. The hadronic W has been reconstructed by the CDF collaboration <ref> (Yao, 1995) </ref>. The method uses W + 4 jet events with two b-tagged jets. One of the jets is tagged using either of the standard CDF lepton or vertex tagging algorithms. <p> Therefore, this ratio can be measured by comparing the number of single- and double-b-tagged t t ! lepton + jets events and by measuring the tagging rate in t t ! dilepton events. A preliminary analysis by the CDF collaboration finds <ref> (Yao, 1995) </ref>: Br (t ! W b) = 0:94 0:27 0:13 and sets a (not-yet-very-interesting) limit jV tb j &gt; 0.022 at the 95% confidence level. The statistical sensitivity for this branching ratio measurement is projected to be 3% for a 1 fb 1 exposure (Amidei and Brock, 1996). <p> Measurements of the t t invariant mass distributions are possible in the lepton + jets channel. Preliminary CDF <ref> (Yao, 1995) </ref> and D0 (Narain, 1996) analyses are consistent with QCD expectations, (see Fig. 111). With the high statistics that will become available, these models will be critically tested in the future.
