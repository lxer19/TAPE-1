Abstract: As the use of the Internet for electronic commerce, audio and video conferencing, and other applications with sensitive content grows, the need for secure services becomes critical. Central to the success of these services is the support for secure public key distribution. Although there are several existing services available for this purpose, they are not very scalable, either because they depend on a centralized server or rely on ad hoc trust relationships. In this paper, we present and examine a flexible approach to certificate distribution scalable to arbitrarily large networks. We propose a two level hierarchy where certificates can be independently authenticated by one or more peer authorities, called keyservers. Certificates for end-user and host entities are managed within local domains, called enterprises. By administering certificates close to the source, we reduce the load on the key servers and the effects of network topology changes. We describe the design of our system and present a preliminary performance analysis based on traces of present-day DNS requests.

The Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) Certificate Hierarchy defines a design for certificate (public key) distribution to be used by all entities on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: After appropriate mutual validation of credentials, the keyserver signs and caches the enterprise certificate and the enterprise root signs and caches the keyserver certificate. A thorough description of the use of digital signatures can be found in <ref> [DH76] </ref>. Each enterprise encompasses some organization of end users. The enterprise is intended to represent a group of geographically close local area networks under control of a single administrative authority.

Reference-contexts: We argue that DNS (Domain Name Service) [Moc87a, Moc87b] likely has the usage characteristics that our system will encounter. Similar to certificate requests, DNS requests are most often used as a precursor to a session <ref> [DOK92] </ref>. From an analysis of DNS traffic we can determine when, how often, and to whom connections are made. Assuming that the secure communication supported by our key distribution hierarchy follows the same traffic pattern as DNS, we propose to estimate the performance of our system based on DNS traffic. <p> From this, we attribute this surge to lunch hour 8 Internet surfing. Due to errors in some DNS implementations, the DNS resolver may send several requests for the same address to the server rapidly <ref> [DOK92] </ref>. We consider a request for a single address within a single second from the same source as a suspect request. We cannot state that a suspect request is invalid, as a host that does not cache DNS data will correctly generate them.

Reference-contexts: In extant systems, Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are used for this purpose. Unfortunately, CRLs create a different set of problems. The mechanics of disbursing this potentially large set of revoked certificates to an enumerable set of interested parties presents a daunting task. Similar to DNSsec <ref> [Eas98] </ref>, we avoid many of the problems associated with key revocation by requiring short 6 hold times on cache entries. When a certificate is re-voked, the enterprise or keyservers that advertise the certificate immediately flush the certificate from its permanent cache. <p> The Kerberos services act as a third party in which modeled from class B and class C addresses in the DNS trace. both end-points (entities) trust. In strict hierarchies, such as the Privacy Enhanced Mail [Ken93], X.500 Directory [], Public Key Infrastructure [Cho94], and DNSsec <ref> [Eas98] </ref> services form a rooted hierarchy under which all secruity is ultimately gaurenteed by the root authority. The Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) Certificate Hierarchy defines a design for certificate (public key) distribution to be used by all entities on the Internet. <p> The signers for the certificates are defined by their position in the tree, whose path within the tree is 11 required to be unique. Extentions to the existing DNS service that provide secure distribution of public key certificates are specified in <ref> [Eas98] </ref>. The service, called DNSsec, introduces new resource records containing public key certificates. In retrieving certificates, DNSsec uses the same distribution hierarchy and communication channel as DNS. Revocation of certificates is similar to those found in KDH.

Reference-contexts: End users indirectly subscribe only to those keyservers in which they have some level of trust. Verification of certificates may be performed by polling a subset of the subscribed keyservers, from which a majority result is used. The DNSSEC <ref> [EK99] </ref> specification outlines a key distribution hierarchy that uses the existing DNS infrastructure to support authenticated retrieval of DNS data. When retrieving a DNS record an application will traverse the DNS hierarchy, recursively authenticating each zone.

Reference-contexts: If the parent node timer expires before a response is seen in the group, it multicasts the request to the next higher group in the tree. This random wait response scheme at each level is similar to those used in the SRM <ref> [Flo95] </ref> reliable multicast protocol. This process is repeated until a response is received or the request timer expires at the root node in the tree. In the latter case, the enterprise root retrieves the certificate via the enterprise external protocol and returns the response certificate.

Reference-contexts: Certificate hold times over 5 minutes at each enterprise reduce the load on the keyserver by as much as 60%. Using the us domain trace, we simulate a keyserver and the associated requesting enterprises. Because the CIDR blocks <ref> [FLYV93] </ref> of the requesters in our trace were unavailable, we execute two simulations. In the first simulation, we treat all addresses as Class-C addresses, using the first 24 bits of their address. If two addresses have the same first 24 bits, they are deemed to be in the same enterprise.

Reference-contexts: By making these channels independent, an enterprise root can validate received certificates. Users may also opt to validate certificates through several independent channels, resulting in increased confidence in their authenticity. This approach is similar to mechanisms for high-availability proposed in <ref> [GS91] </ref>. The architecture must be flexible. The topology of the Internet is constantly changing, so the architecture and underlying protocols must not be dependent on the physical connectivity or location of any singular authority. Mobility of users is of equal importance.

Reference-contexts: If it is not on the list, the certificates are assumed to be valid. The IETF Internet Public-Key Infrastructure working group (PKIX) outlines version 3 of the X.509 specification in <ref> [HFPS98] </ref>. The specification adds several new fields in the certificates, as well as propose a new mechanism for limiting the length of the certification path of hierarchical systems. Directed by strictly defined policies, certificates may be retrieved from peer authorities without consulting the hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: While we also identify several important issues related to the security of the proposed architecture itself, a rigorous analysis of the security provided by the architecture is outside the scope of this paper. In the Privacy Enhance Mail system (PEM) <ref> [Ken93] </ref>, the authors define a certification authority whose require 1 ments are similar to that defined in this paper. They de-scribe a rooted tree, where the security of all certificates are ultimately guaranteed by the root authority. In a global network, finding one authority which all users trust is problematic. <p> Later, during authentication, multiple keyservers may be consulted. Keyservers are intended to be administered independently by regional, national, or global organizations. In terms of hardware and administrative practices, these servers should have many of the same characteristics of those defined for the PCA services of RFC 1422 <ref> [Ken93] </ref>. These practices define procedures used for mutual authentication before the exchange of signatures. For example, a keyserver may choose not to exchange signatures with some enterprise unless the administrators can provide sufficient proof of the security of their own internal signing practices. <p> Realms securely register secrets with other realms, which are later used establish inter-realm tickets. Users communicating between realms are then required to trust both end-points; the source and target realms. As with the single rooted hierarchy described in the PEM specification <ref> [Ken93] </ref>, the quality of retrieved certificates is only as good as the local administration of both end points. In fact, when both enterprises share a keyserver, the trust model is very similar. With respect to trust, our proposed system has two distinct advantages over PEM. <p> These tickets are used to bootstrap secure communication between the service and the user. The Kerberos services act as a third party in which modeled from class B and class C addresses in the DNS trace. both end-points (entities) trust. In strict hierarchies, such as the Privacy Enhanced Mail <ref> [Ken93] </ref>, X.500 Directory [], Public Key Infrastructure [Cho94], and DNSsec [Eas98] services form a rooted hierarchy under which all secruity is ultimately gaurenteed by the root authority.

Reference-contexts: Primarily, we seek to find the best choices for caching policies and certificate hold times. Unfortunately, there are limited existing systems of this type from which we can collect data.

Similar to certificate requests, DNS requests are most often used as a precursor to a session [DOK92]. From an analysis of DNS traffic we can determine when, how often, and to whom connections are made. <p> It is worth noting that we do not specify a mechanism for locating the enterprise root node of an external enterprise. There are several existing designs for scalable network directory services, such as DNS <ref> [Moc87a, Moc87b] </ref>. These services are readily available within today's Internet infrastructure, and as such are beyond the scope of this paper. We illustrate this protocol through an example. We return to our example hierarchy description in Figure 2. Assume all hosts initially have empty caches, save the permanent entries.

Reference-contexts: In this way, the attacker could induce a user into using a revoked key.

There are several approaches for achieving freshness described in <ref> [NS78] </ref> and [Sch96]. Our approach to certificate revocation that relies on certificate hold time offers several advantages over the use of CRLs. First, the control over the window of vulnerability is left to the user.

Reference-contexts: The keyservers are also 4 trusted in this way, but alternate channels for validating certificates are available. Keyservers are logically the entities furthest removed from the end-points, and are likely to be least trusted. This model is simlar to other public key and trusted third party systems. Kerberos <ref> [SNS88, NT94] </ref> is a trusted third party key distribution system based on symmetric key cryptography. Users appeal to Ticket Granting Servers (TGS) for tickets to services and other users. These tickets are then used to establish a symmetric session key under which secure communication can be supported. <p> We classify the resultant key distribution systems into three classes: trusted third party, hierarchical, and ad-hoc. Trusted third party systems such as Kerberos <ref> [NT94, SNS88] </ref> rely on secrets shared with local trusted athori-ties. In larger networks, the authorities collaborate or form hierarchies to allow intra-domain secure communication. The Kerberos system is a symmetric (private key) system used to provide authentication in a network environment.

Reference-contexts: The overall peak rate is seen during the normal 8am to 5pm periods, while the remaining periods see less traffic. We found DNS request arrival rates to be Poisson distributed. Since DNS requests usually precede TCP session arrivals, this observation is in agreement with the finding reported in <ref> [PF95] </ref> that TCP session arrivals are Poisson. In Figure 4, we show the number of request per minute, as seen over the entire umich.edu trace. Enterprise local request arrivals vary between .5 and 4 of the average, measured over one minute periods.

Reference-contexts: A certificate contains the public key of some entity and a series of other fields that indicate the identity, contact information, expiration time, and other features of the certificate. The X.509 <ref> [Rec93] </ref> specification describes a popular format for public key certificates. In this paper, we assume all certificates contain a public key generated using the RSA [RSA92, RSA78] cryptographic algorithm. We do not limit the type of entity that can own a certificate. <p> By convention, a user will only sign a certificate if they trust the source from which it was received. Therefore, when a certificate is received from a trusted source (such as a network administrator), their signature should provide assurance that the certificate is valid. The X.509 <ref> [Rec93] </ref> specification describes both the format of public key certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL). The certificate revocation scheme used in X.509 describes the periodic publication of CRLs. <p> End users bound the time in which they are vulnerable to compromised certificates by setting the hold time for received certificates. Our architecture can accommodate much shorter bounds on the window of vulnerability than systems described in the X.509 specification <ref> [Rec93] </ref>, which use certificate revocation lists to advertise explicitly that keys have been revoked. We evaluate the scalability and performance of our proposed key distribution hierarchy by using traces of Domain Name Service traffic. We argue that characteristics of DNS traffic mirror those of future certificate hierarchies.

Reference-contexts: The effect of relaxing this requirement would be the introduction of additional intermediate keyservers into the authentication process, which may lower confidence in the process. In the degenerate case, the retrieval process would become similar to authentication in the PGP <ref> [Zim94] </ref> system (see Section 2.3). 3 rect certificates. However, this trust need not be absolute. Later, during authentication, multiple keyservers may be consulted. Keyservers are intended to be administered independently by regional, national, or global organizations. <p> Revocation is handled by the removal of the revoked certificate from the authoritative DNS server. Ad-hoc distribution services do not specify an architecture or service model for distribution. Users are free to exchange certificates in any way they wish. The public key certificate based Pretty Good Privacy <ref> [Zim94] </ref> (PGP) system defines a key signing scheme based on webs of trust. In PGP, public key certificates are distributed insecurely. Certificates are digitally signed serially resulting in an ordered list of signatures attached to the original certificate.
