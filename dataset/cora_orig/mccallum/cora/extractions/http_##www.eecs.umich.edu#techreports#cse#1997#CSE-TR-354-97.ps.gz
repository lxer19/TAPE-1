Abstract: We propose a flow-control scheme that combines the merits of credit- and rate-based flow-control schemes by applying direct control over both bandwidth and buffer resources. The goal of the proposed scheme is to design an optimal rate-control policy for a given finite buffer capacity by maximizing average throughput and bounding end-to-end delay. By applying the second-order rate control, the proposed scheme not only makes the rate process converge to the neighborhood of link bandwidth, but also confines the queue-length fluctuation to a regime bounded by buffer capacity. Using hop-by-hop credit flow control, the proposed scheme ensures lossless transmission with a finite buffer capacity while maintaining high network utilization. The source dynamically adjusts its transmission rate and rate-control parameters according to both the network congestion status and whether or not the system states are in the target operating regime. Using the fluid approximation method, we model the proposed flow-control scheme and study the system dynamic behavior for ABR (Available Bit Rate) service under the most stressful traffic condition. We derive the expressions for queue build-ups and average throughput in the equilibrium states as functions of rate-control parameters, feedback delay, link bandwidth, and buffer capacity. Based on the analytical results, we identify the optimal equilibrium state and propose the second-order rate control algorithm for transient-state flow control. We derive a sufficient condition which guarantees the second-order rate control to drive the system from any transient state to an optimal equilibrium state. The worst-case performance bounds, derived as the closed-form functions of flow-control parameters, provide an analytical means of evaluating the performance of the second-order rate control in terms of convergence speed and buffer utilization. The analytical results for both single and multiple connection scenarios have shown the proposed scheme to be stable and efficient in that the source rate and bottleneck queue length rapidly converge to a small neighborhood of the designated operating point. Also, presented are examples showing that the proposed scheme outperforms the other existing schemes.

Reference-contexts: Sending a credit cell per N data cells is more economical since it keeps overhead traffic at a fixed percentage of data traffic. However, a credit-check cell <ref> [3] </ref> needs to be sent periodically to ensure the recovery from possible loss of credit cells. There are two important features for the credit scheme described above.

Reference-contexts: In previous 2 performance analyses, the maximum queue length Q max was treated as a free parameter under the unrealistic assumption of infinite buffer capacity <ref> [5, 12-15, 18-20] </ref>. In contrast, we assume the buffer capacity C max is finite and use Q max &lt; C max as a constraint to find the optimal rate-control function. We derive closed-form expressions for queue build-ups and average throughput in both transient and equilibrium states. <p> Due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and approximation accuracy (particularly for heavy traffic), the fluid modeling method has been effectively applied to the analysis and evaluation of several common rate-based flow-control schemes <ref> [5, 12-15, 18-20] </ref>. In all previous analyses using the fluid model, the maximum queue length Q max is treated as a free parameter under the unrealistic assumption that buffer capacity is infinite [5, 12-15, 18-20]. <p> fluid modeling method has been effectively applied to the analysis and evaluation of several common rate-based flow-control schemes <ref> [5, 12-15, 18-20] </ref>. In all previous analyses using the fluid model, the maximum queue length Q max is treated as a free parameter under the unrealistic assumption that buffer capacity is infinite [5, 12-15, 18-20]. In a real network, however, this assumption does not hold, and thus, the results based on this assumption are not applicable to the case of finite buffer capacity. <p> Thus, the rate adjustment at SES can be modeled by "linear increase" and "exponential-decrease" in a continuous domain with the following expressions <ref> [5] </ref>: R (t) = R (t 0 ) + ff (t t 0 ); Linear increase R (t 0 )e (1fi) (tt 0 ) ; Exponential decrease (4.2) where t is the current time; t 0 the time of the last rate-update; ff = a= and fi = 1 + log <p> Our numerical analyses indicate that, in equilibrium state, a smaller ff results in a higher average throughput, but for quick transient response and high throughput, a large ff is desirable. This observation is consistent with the conclusion in <ref> [5] </ref>: "a sharp reduction in the transient state and a smaller rate reduction in the equilibrium state".

Reference-contexts: Interworking ? We first describe rate and credit schemes, and then compare them in terms of structures and performance, arguing for the need to integrate them. 2.1 The Rate Scheme We briefly describe the operation mode of the rate-based congestion-control mechanism, drawing mainly from the ATM Forum traffic management standard <ref> [9] </ref>. The standard only specifies the behaviors of the 3 Source End System (SES) and the Destination End System (DES), leaving the implementation of ATM switches to manufacturers. Figure 1 illustrates the basic configuration of the rate scheme. <p> Both types of switches may coexist in a single network environment and also backward RM cells may be generated by a switch to achieve quick congestion notification/dissipation. A detailed description of rate-based flow control can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>. 2.2 The Credit Scheme The operation of the credit-based flow control is shown in Figure 2 for a single-hop VC.

Reference-contexts: So, ABR service requires a closed-loop congestion-control scheme, dynamically regulating the cell-transmission rate of each source according to congestion status. A number of flow-control schemes have been proposed for ABR service. Among these, both credit [1-4] and rate [5-9] schemes have received most attention <ref> [10] </ref>. The credit scheme guarantees lossless transmission by applying direct control over buffer space for each connection in a hop-by-hop manner. However, the credit scheme cannot make a bandwidth guarantee for each connection since it is window-type flow control and does not regulate the traffic flow rate [11].

However, the credit scheme cannot make a bandwidth guarantee for each connection since it is window-type flow control and does not regulate the traffic flow rate <ref> [11] </ref>. Moreover, the credit scheme attempts to keep the buffer full to achieve high utilization. This may result in unbounded end-to-end delays and large delay variations.

Reference-contexts: We model this system by using the first-order fluid approximation method, which characterizes the system with coupled time-delayed differential equations <ref> [17, 18] </ref>. In this model, we use the real-valued deterministic functions R (t) and Q (t) to approximate a discrete-valued stochastic rate process R (t) at the source and a queue length process Q (t) at the bottleneck node, respectively. <p> The non-linear dynamics of the rate functions reflect the fact that Q (t) 2 [0; ~]. This first-order fluid model has been shown in <ref> [17] </ref> to be a good approximation when the system is heavily-loaded.

In addition, setting ff 1fi = confines us to a simpler scenario where we only need to control one parameter ff, instead of both ff and fi.

Reference-contexts: However, here we only concentrate on how to reduce ff to ensure the maximum queue length does not grow beyond a given buffer capacity while achieving a good transient response. A more general algorithm for the second-order rate control is detailed in <ref> [21] </ref>, where we proposed 21 an optimal ff-control law for both decreasing and increasing the rate parameter ff. The control rule for reducing ff is described by a discrete function, as it is exercised only at time instants when the buffer congestion occurs.

Reference-contexts: Also shown in the examples is that R (t) and Q (t) can quickly converge to the optimal operation region. We have developed a simulator using NetSim package <ref> [22] </ref>. The simulation results verified the analytical results for the single-connection case. We are currently extending the simulator to the multiple-connection case. Also to be simulated is the dynamic behavior of multiple connections using the realized bandwidth as the target bandwidth, which is more accurate, but analytically intractable.
