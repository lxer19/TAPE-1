Abstract: We created MadBase, a relational database initiated for the Bacillus subtilis genome analysis. It links genetic map of the microbe, we author, with its sequences, and we added some of other bacteria. DNA comes from primary databanks entries, EMBL, GenBank, and we get a non-redundant controlled set from the SubtiList database. Sequences and genes are searched by graphical navigation on genetic and physical maps. They are also retrieved from their elementary properties composing associated text annotations in distributed data record files. For this, informations are automatically loaded in a detailed data model with standard text processing and translation tools. We use grammars to parse and to adapt to syntactic ambiguities of incoming record files. The database is endowed with a user-friendly query interface through the World Wide Web hypermedia information service on Internet, allowing an international, multiplatform, and accountless access. As its acceptance is growing among molecular biologists, links are offered to related general on-line informations such as sequences of SwissProt, structures of PDB and others, an immediate alternative to data input in our relational model.

Reference-contexts: It is interfaced to a Worl Wide Web server. Its reference on Internet : http://locus.jouy.inra.fr It is operational for Bacillus subtilis genetic map and sequences.

We plan to add every microbial sequence, eventually from already controlled sources, when available. We recently integrated genetic map data for Escherichia coli, from the ECD database [3].

Reference-contexts: We plan to add every microbial sequence, eventually from already controlled sources, when available. We recently integrated genetic map data for Escherichia coli, from the ECD database <ref> [3] </ref>. We prepare genetic maps for lactic bacteria, studied in the laboratory, and will add in the future those for other species, to perform comparative genetic studies. Research of sequences and genes is based on annotations, like taxons, features, bibliography. It goes through selection menus, and name or value inputs.

Reference-contexts: They are based on context-free grammars, here describing record syntactic rules in the Backus-Naur Form specification language, and use recursive descending methods to analyze the hierachical informations inside records. There are many benefits to use grammars for translation. They permit complete parsing of data, especially sequence features <ref> [9] </ref>, first giving user access to fine information extractions. Facing product diversity, automatic filters contribute to data interchange between databases. The data quality improvements can be distributed between heterogeneous platforms. Moreover, controlling basic information units can facilitate future evolution towards different data organization models and information systems.
