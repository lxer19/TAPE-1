Reference-contexts: For every q a power of a prime there exists a projective plane of order q, called the the Desarguesian plane and denoted by P G (2; q). Not all projective planes of a given order are isomorphic. It was explained to me by S. Ball and A. Blokhuis <ref> [1] </ref> that the above projective plane of order q is Desarguesian. In Section 2 the notion of curves or bivariate polynomials representing t-designs is defined. It is shown that F q (X; Y ) represents P G (2; q). <p> Proof. See also <ref> [1] </ref>. The polynomial f q (T ) has q + 1 distinct zeros in P q by Lemma 2.4. Let x 2 P q and let ff be a zero of f q (T ). Define y = ffx q . Then y 2 P q . <p> Proposition 2.6 The triple (P q ; P q ; I q ) is isomorphic with the Desarguesian plane of order q. Proof. The proof is from <ref> [1] </ref>. The finite field F q 3 is isomorphic with F 3 q as an F q -vector space. Let 0 , 1 , 2 be a basis of F q 3 over F q .

Reference-contexts: Blahut challenged coding theorists to give a selfcontained account of the properties of codes on curves [3].

The elementary treatment of algebraic geometry codes [8, 9, 10, 14] is now based on the observation that: if a decoding algorithm corrects t errors, then the minimum distance of the code is at least 2t + 1.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The projective plane curve with defining equation X 3 Y + Y 3 Z + Z 3 X = 0: has been studied for numerous reasons since Klein [19]. It was shown by Hurwitz <ref> [16, 17] </ref> that a curve considered over the complex numbers has at most 84 (g 1) automorphims, where g is the genus and g &gt; 1. The above curve, nowadays called the Klein quartic, has genus 3 and an automorphism group of 168 elements.
