Title: Comparison of Duplex and Triplex Memory Reliability  
Author: Nitin H. Vaidya 
Keyword: Index Terms: Reliability, replication, coding, modular redundancy.  
Abstract: A large number of choices exist when designing a reliable memory system. The choices range from simple replication to complex error control codes (ECC). An intermediate solution is to use combination of replication and simple ECC. Such a system consists of multiple memory modules, data stored in each module being encoded using an ECC. This paper compares reliability of memory systems formed using simple triplication (without ECC) with memory systems formed by duplicating memory modules that use ECC. It is shown that reliability achieved by duplication of memory modules using codes capable of only error detection or only single error correction (SEC), is always worse than simple triplication. However, it is also shown that duplication of memory modules, with codes capable of single error correction and double error detection (SEC-DED), can achieve better reliability than simple triplication when bit error probability is small.

Reference-contexts: An intermediate solution is to use combination of replication and simple ECC. Such a system consists of multiple memory modules, data stored in each module being encoded using an ECC. A similar approach has been used in commercial systems <ref> [1] </ref>. Reliability of memory systems formed by simple triplication (without ECC) is compared here with that of memory systems formed by duplicating memory modules that use ECC. These two systems, referred to as triplex and duplex systems, respectively, are illustrated in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, our goal now is to prove that h (p) &gt; 0. Note that h (0) = 0 and h (1=2) = 0. Also function h is differentiable in [0; 1=2]. Therefore, by Rolle's theorem <ref> [2] </ref>, at least one extrema (maxima or minima) exists between p = 0 and p = 1=2. Now, dh dp 2 = 4 (1p) 2 . Note that for p = 0, dh dp = 0 and d 2 h dp 2 &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction A large number of choices exist when designing a reliable memory system. The choices range from simple replication to complex error control codes (ECC) <ref> [3] </ref>. Simple replication (without ECC) can achieve a better performance as compared to systems using ECC, because ECC necessitate decoding. An intermediate solution is to use combination of replication and simple ECC. Such a system consists of multiple memory modules, data stored in each module being encoded using an ECC. <p> Definition Reliability R S of a memory system S is defined as the probability that all words in the memory system can be accessed correctly. A data word contains k bits, therefore, the probability that a given word in the triplex system can be accessed correctly is <ref> [3] </ref> R fl triplex = h i k Therefore, reliability of the triplex system is given by R triplex = (R fl triplex ) W . 3.

Reference-contexts: Reliability of the Triplex System For reliability analysis, we use the independent symmetric error model <ref> [4] </ref>. It is assumed that each bit in memory may become erroneous independently with probability p. In practice, bit error probability p is expected to be quite small. Each data word contains k bits. <p> We illustrate this with an example. Assume that the ECC used in the duplex system is a (n; k) SEC-DED code obtained by (possibly) shortening the distance-4 extended Hamming code <ref> [4] </ref>. For the SEC-DED code, n = 39 when k = 32. For k = 32, Figure 2 plots the unreliability (i.e., 1reliability) for duplex and triplex systems as a function of p. Similar plots are obtained for other values of k.

Reference-contexts: Note that reliability is evaluated here using error probability, not failure probability. The two probabilities are different, as a failure does not necessarily result in an error. 2 Also, our analysis does not take into account compensating failures 3 <ref> [5] </ref>. Definition Reliability R S of a memory system S is defined as the probability that all words in the memory system can be accessed correctly.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, R fl duplex2 &lt; R fl triplex . Similar to above, for k = 1 and 2 also, it can be shown that R fl duplex2 &lt; R fl triplex <ref> [6] </ref>. This implies that R duplex2 &lt; R triplex . 2 Although the result stated above is proved for 0 &lt; p &lt; 1=3, we conjecture that it holds true when 0 &lt; p &lt; 1=2.

Reference-contexts: To our knowledge, such an analysis has not been carried out before. The work presented here is motivated by our previous research on modular redundant system reliability and safety <ref> [7] </ref>. Capability of an ECC is characterized by the number of errors it can correct and detect.
