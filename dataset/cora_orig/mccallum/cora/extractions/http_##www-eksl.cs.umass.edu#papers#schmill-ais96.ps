Abstract: Finding patterns in temporally structured data is an important and difficult problem. Examples of temporally structured data include time series of economic indicators, distributed network status reports, and continuous streams such as flight recorder data. We have developed a family of algorithms for finding structure in multivariate, discrete-valued time series data (Oates & Cohen 1996b; Oates, Schmill, & Cohen 1996; Oates et al. 1995). In this paper, we introduce a new member of that family for handling event-based data, and offer an empirical characterization of a time series based algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Event logs were generated by a modified version of the Netsim network simulator which is publicly available from MIT <ref> (Heybey & Robertson 1994) </ref>. The simulator was modified to allow randomly selected components to fail. In addition, a monitor component was added to the simulator to act as a Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP the Internet standard for network management) proxy agent.

Reference-contexts: The systematic search for rules continues until all of the unvisited nodes at the fringe of the search tree have no chance at being among the k strongest dependencies. 3.2 Empirical Evaluation Msdd has been tested in several domains, including learning planning operators <ref> (Oates & Cohen 1996a) </ref>, predicting pathologies in a simulating shipping network, and classification (Oates & Cohen 1996b). Our purpose here is to provide an empirical assessment of its performance when its parameters and the structure of datasets are manipulated. Each dataset comprised n streams of length l tokens.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, f (up *)g ) f (down router)g is a valid child, but f (up router)g ) f (down *)g would not be generated because it requires adding a non-wildcard to the left of down. (The interested reader is referred to <ref> (Oates & Cohen 1996b) </ref> for a detailed discussion of the use of this type of operator ordering to achieve systematicity.) medd's search through the space of dependencies is guided by a best-first heuristic. <p> upper bound on the G statistic for the children of a given rule, msdd is able to prune large portions of the search space when the upper bound on G for a node's children is found to be less than that of the worst rule present in the k-best list <ref> (Oates & Cohen 1996b) </ref>. <p> until all of the unvisited nodes at the fringe of the search tree have no chance at being among the k strongest dependencies. 3.2 Empirical Evaluation Msdd has been tested in several domains, including learning planning operators (Oates & Cohen 1996a), predicting pathologies in a simulating shipping network, and classification <ref> (Oates & Cohen 1996b) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A problem that plagues network managers is the large number of events of different types from disparate locations in the network that result from network faults <ref> (Oates 1995) </ref>. Finding patterns in those events to form clusters of related events is important for reducing the amount of information that must be interpreted and 1 This research is supported by DARPA/RL F30602-93-C-0076, and by a subcontract from Hughes Information Technology Corp.RFQ 96-ECS-UMass-001. U.S. <p> The number of timesteps spanned by the precursor or successor is called the block size. The precursor and successor above have block sizes of 2 and 1, respectively. Rules like this are hard to find; the search space is exponential <ref> (Oates et al. 1995) </ref>. Msdd treats dependency detection as an efficient search for the k most predictive rules in the search space. 3.1 The MSDD Algorithm Msdd accepts as input a dataset of streams, each of which comprises a list of categorical tokens.

Reference-contexts: The nodes are then filtered to identify those that represent strong dependencies as measured by G, a statistical measure of non-independence <ref> (Wickens 1989) </ref>. The precursors of the remaining rules can then be matched against new event data to predict occurrences of their successors. Precursor and successor event patterns contain one or more partially instantiated events (PIEs). <p> For the purpose of rating nodes, msdd uses the G statistic for measuring nonindependence in 2x2 contingency tables <ref> (Wickens 1989) </ref>. Msdd maintains a list of k rules sorted by the G statistic.
