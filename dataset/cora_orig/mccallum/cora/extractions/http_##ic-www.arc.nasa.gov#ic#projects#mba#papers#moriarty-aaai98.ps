Abstract: A new generation of sensor rich, massively distributed autonomous system is being developed, such as smart buildings and reconfigurable factories. To achieve high performance these systems will need to accurately model themselves and their environment from sensor information. Accomplishing this on a grand scale requires automating the art of large-scale modeling. To this end we have developed decompositional, model-based learning (DML). DML takes a parameterized model and sensed variables as input, decomposes it, and synthesizes a coordinated sequence of "simplest" estimation tasks. The method exploits a rich analogy between parameter estimation and consistency-based diagnosis. Moriarty, an implementation of DML, has been applied to thermal modeling of a smart building, demonstrating a significant improvement in learning rate. A new generation of sensor rich, massively distributed, autonomous systems is being developed, such as networked building energy systems, autonomous space probes, and biosphere-like life support systems, that have the potential for profound environmental and economic change (Williams & Nayak 1996). To achieve high performance, these immobile robots will need to develop sophisticated regulatory systems that accurately and robustly control their complex internal functions. To accomplish this immobots will exploit a vast nervous system of sensors to accurately estimate models of themselves and their environment on a grand scale. Handling these large scale model estimation tasks requires high-level reasoning methods that coordinate a large set of traditional adaptive processes. Decompositional, model-based learning (DML) and its implementation Moriarty address this problem, providing a high-level reasoning method that generates and coordinates a set of nonlinear estimation codes, by exploiting a rich analogy to ATMS-based prime impli-cant generation(de Kleer 1986) and consistency-based diagnosis (e.g., (de Kleer & Williams 1987)). y Caelum Research Corporation.
