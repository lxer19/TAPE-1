Abstract: We investigate the one-point Cell Delay Variation and the Cell Transfer Delay for a given constant bit rate connection under Test Scenarios 1 through 4 described in contribution ATM_Forum/94-265. Furthermore, we studied the buffer occupancy at the multiplexor. This contribution provides a sum-mary of our initial results. This contribution has been prepared to assist the ATM Forum. This document is offered to the Forum as a basis for discussion and is not a binding proposal on Bellcore or the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs).

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction We investigate the one-point Cell Delay Variation (CDV) and the Cell Transfer Delay (CTD) for a given constant bit rate (CBR) connection under Test Scenarios 1 through 4 described in the contribution ATM_Forum/94-265 <ref> [1] </ref> . Furthermore, we studied the buffer occupancy at the multiplexor. This contribution provides a summary of our initial results. We consider the single node configuration (Configuration 1 described in ATM_Forum/94-265) as shown in Figure 1.
