Abstract: If A is a set in AC 0 such that for some q &gt; 0 and infinitely many n, jA n j &gt; 2 nlog q n , then A contains more than quasipolynomially many strings with polynomial-time bounded length-conditioned Kolmogorov complexity below n * , for arbitrary * &gt; 0, at each length n where A satisfies the above density condition. As a consequence, we exhibit a set A in NP such that all sets consisting of strings that have small Hamming distance to some string in A are bi-immune to sets in AC 0 that satisfy the above density condition.

Reference-contexts: Besides what follows from the almost-everywhere deterministic time and space hierachies, Allender and Gore <ref> [AG91] </ref> have shown that there is a set in P PP that is bi-immune to a uniform variant of AC 0 . They have also shown that NP cannot be separated with immunity from uniform AC 0 by relativizable techniques. <p> It is known from the work of Furst, Saxe and Sipser [FSS84] that AC 0 is properly contained in NC 1 . But, if we pass to strong separations, i.e. separations with immunity or bi-immunity, our current level of knowledge is extremely low. Allender and Gore <ref> [AG91] </ref> have observed that DSP ACE [S (n)] is bi-immune for Dlogtime-uniform AC 0 for S (n) space-constructible such that log n = o (S (n)) and also that DT IM E [T (n)] is bi-immune for Dlogtime-uniform AC 0 for T (n) time-constructible such that n k = o (T

Reference-contexts: More importantly, such separations are achievable within currently known techniques if we restrict our attention to abundant sets in AC 0 . Ajtai's results <ref> [Ajt83] </ref> easily imply that PARITY = fx 2 fl j the number of 1's in x is even g is bi-immune with respect to abundant sets in AC 0 and using Hastad's results one can improve the above to abundant sets that are accepted by constant depth circuits with 2 subpolynomial <p> Returning to our definition, it should be noted that there are sets that, although not AC 0 - computable, have all sufficiently close approximations in AC 0 . PARITY clearly is one example. More interestingly, Ajtai <ref> [Ajt83] </ref> has shown that EXACT-HALF = fx 2 fl j the number of 1's in x is 1=2jxj g is not in AC 0 but all its 1= log i n-approximations are in AC 0 for all naturals i.

Reference-contexts: The above property is obtained by following the ideas of Allender <ref> [All89] </ref> and Han and Hemas-paandra [HH95] that relate the existence of secure pseudo-random generators to the existence of large sets with some appropriate density of strings of low time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity. <p> These ideas were used in <ref> [All89] </ref> and in [HH95] to infer conditions under which pseudo-random generators secure against attacks of various computational power do not exist. We use these ideas in the other direction. Nisan [Nis91] has displayed pseudo-random generators which are demonstrated to be secure against AC 0 statistical tests. <p> The results similar to this one were left open in <ref> [All89] </ref> and [HH95]. The key element which allows this type of stronger result is the use of conditional Kolmogorov complexity (both [All89] and [HH95] worked with the unconditional variant).

The key element which allows this type of stronger result is the use of conditional Kolmogorov complexity (both [All89] and [HH95] worked with the unconditional variant). Remark 2. If we consider sets that are "more than abundant", then the requirements on the conditional Kolmogorov complexity can be lowered.

Reference-contexts: Looking at the catalog of complexity classes displayed by Johnson [Joh90], there is one more known important separation, namely the separation of the circuit classes AC 0 and NC 1 achieved by Furst, Saxe and Sipser <ref> [FSS84] </ref>. Although the deterministic hierarchy theorems have been extended to separations with bi-immunity (or, equivalently, to the case of a.e. separation) by Geske, Huynh and Seiferas [GHS91], the currently known strong separation from AC 0 are quite weak. <p> It is known from the work of Furst, Saxe and Sipser <ref> [FSS84] </ref> that AC 0 is properly contained in NC 1 .

Besides what follows from the almost-everywhere deterministic time and space hierachies, Allender and Gore [AG91] have shown that there is a set in P PP that is bi-immune to a uniform variant of AC 0 . <p> This results follow simply from the fact that AC 0 is contained in DSP ACE [log n] and from the almost-everywhere complexity hierarchy proven by Geske, Huynh and Seiferas <ref> [GHS91] </ref>. Allender and Gore have also shown that P PP is bi-immune to Dlogtime-uniform AC 0 (in fact even to ACC). More surprisingly, Allender and Gore have constructed oracles relative to which the question whether NP is separated from Dlogtime-uniform AC 0 with immunity is answered both ways.
