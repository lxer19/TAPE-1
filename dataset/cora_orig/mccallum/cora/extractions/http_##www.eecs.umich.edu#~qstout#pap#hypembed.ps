Abstract: One important aspect of efficient use of a hypercube computer to solve a given problem is the assignment of subtasks to processors in such a way that the communication overhead is low. The subtasks and their inter-communication requirements can be modeled by a graph, and the assignment of subtasks to processors viewed as an embedding of the task graph into the graph of the hypercube network. We survey the known results concerning such embeddings, including expansion/dilation tradeoffs for general graphs, embeddings of meshes and trees, pack-ings of multiple copies of a graph, the complexity of finding good embeddings, and critical graphs which are minimal with respect to some property. In addition, we describe several open problems.

Reference-contexts: Deciding if a graph is cubical, or deciding if a noncubical graph is cube-critical, can be quite difficult. Afrati, Papidimitriou, and Papageorgiou <ref> [1] </ref> and Krumme, Venkataraman, and Cybenko [20], showed that the problem of deciding whether an arbitrary graph is cubical is NP-complete. The proof of NP-completeness given in [1] shows that the problem remains NP-complete even if the problem is restricted so that the maximum degree of any node is 4. <p> Deciding if a graph is cubical, or deciding if a noncubical graph is cube-critical, can be quite difficult. Afrati, Papidimitriou, and Papageorgiou <ref> [1] </ref> and Krumme, Venkataraman, and Cybenko [20], showed that the problem of deciding whether an arbitrary graph is cubical is NP-complete. The proof of NP-completeness given in [1] shows that the problem remains NP-complete even if the problem is restricted so that the maximum degree of any node is 4. <p> The upper bound was first proven in Garey and Graham [6], and is attained by the star graph K 1;n1 . For more restricted cubical graphs slightly better bounds have been determined. In <ref> [1] </ref>, Afrati, Papadimitriou, and Papageorgiou proved that if G is a biconnected cubical graph of 5 and large cubical dimension n nodes, then cd (G) n=2, and they observed that the graph shown in Figure 2 shows that this bound is the best possible. <p> Other bounds on cubical dimensions of specific trees appear in Havel and Liebl [14, 15] and Wagner [24]. Afrati, Papadimitriou, and Papageorgiou <ref> [1] </ref> gave a polynomial time algorithm which embeds a tree into a cube with dimension at most the square of the cubical dimension of the tree, and they conjectured that the problem of calculating the cubical dimension of a tree is NP-complete.

Reference-contexts: However, as was noted by Nebesky [21], and rediscovered in <ref> [2] </ref>, T n can be embedded into Q n+1 with only one edge undergoing dilation 2. For such an embedding the expansion is as small as possible for a graph with 2 n+1 1 nodes. Several other authors have considered embeddings of binary trees with small dilation or small expansion. <p> Bhatt and Ipsen [3] showed that for an arbitrary binary tree T with n nodes, *(T; 1) O (n 0:71 ). They also showed that ffi (T; 1 + dlg ne) lg lg n + 9. This result was superceded by that of Bhatt et al. <ref> [2] </ref>, who gave a polynomial time algorithm which shows that ffi (T; dlg ne) 10. Their methods extend to graphs with O (1)-separators, such as trees of bounded degree and outerplanar graphs of bounded degree.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, note that neither the complete graph K 3 nor the complete bipartite graph K 2;3 is cubical. In an early paper on isometric embeddings into Q n , Firsov <ref> [5] </ref> showed that all trees are cubical, and also noted that all cubical graphs are bipartite.

Reference-contexts: A direct divide-and-conquer approach can also be used to prove the slightly weaker fact that G has at most 0:5 n lg n edges.

Reference-contexts: Cycles of odd length are cube-critical, as is a diamond with one pair of opposite nodes connected by an extra path of length two. Garey and Graham, and Gorbatov and Kazansky <ref> [8] </ref>, have given procedures for constucting arbitrarily large cube-critical graphs from other cube-critical graphs, and Havel [12] has constructed arbitrarily large cube-critical graphs using meshes with extra edges. Deciding if a graph is cubical, or deciding if a noncubical graph is cube-critical, can be quite difficult.

Reference-contexts: Using this, it is easy to show that a graph is cubical if and only if its biconnected components are, since the biconnected components form a forest. Graham <ref> [9] </ref> has given a condition which can be used to prove that a graph is not cubical. A graph G is decomposable if it has a minimal cutset C of edges such that no two edges in C have a common node, and the removal of C disconnects G.

Greenberg <ref> [10] </ref> has shown that any 2-dimensional mesh can be embedded with dilation no greater than 2 and expansion no greater than 3, and Ho and Johnson [19] have shown that many 2-dimensional meshes can be embedded with dilation and expansion no greater than 2.
