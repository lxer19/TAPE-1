Abstract: We establish the optimal asymptotic decay rate of per-session queue length tail distributions for a two-queue system where a single constant rate server serves the two queues using the Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) scheduling discipline. The result is obtained using the sample-path large deviation principle and has implications in call admission control for high-speed communication networks.

Reference-contexts: future high speed digital networks, in order to support a variety of applications such as voice, video and datagram traffic with diverse traffic characteristics and quality of service (QoS) requirements, it has been suggested to provide different QoS service classes to accommodate this diversity of traffic characteristic and QoS requirement <ref> [1, 10] </ref>. As a result, more sophisticated scheduling mechanism other than the simple First-In First-Out (FIFO) service discipline is needed to provide both protection and bandwidth sharing among service classes. <p> The large deviation principle (LDP) on IR characterizes the limiting behavior of a sequence of probability measures f n ; n 2 INg on IR, where IN is the set of nonnegative integers. We say a function I from IR to <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is a good rate function if all the level sets fy 2 IR : I (y) xg, x 2 [0; 1), are compact. <p> Applying Definition 1 to a space of functions on IR leads to the sample path large deviation principle on IR. Let D (<ref> [0; 1] </ref>; IR) denote the space of right continuous functions with left limits from [0; 1] to IR equipped with the supremum norm topology, i.e., kf k = sup f0ttg jf (t)j, for f 2 D ([0; 1]; IR). We say a sequence of probability measures n on D ([0; 1]; IR) satisfies the sample path large deviation principle with a good rate function I <p> sup f0ttg jf (t)j, for f 2 D (<ref> [0; 1] </ref>; IR). We say a sequence of probability measures n on D ([0; 1]; IR) satisfies the sample path large deviation principle with a good rate function I () if I () is a function from D ([0; 1]; IR) to [0; 1] with compact level sets and the upper bound (1) and the lower bound (2) hold for any closed and open sets in D ([0; 1]; IR), respectively. Let fY n ; n 2 INg be a set of random variables on IR. <p> Now for n = 1; 2; 3; : : :, define a sequence of scaled partial sum processes of fY n ; n 2 INg on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>: 1 bntc X i=1 Clearly, Z (n) 2 D ([0; 1]; IR). Let (n) be the probability measure of Z (n) . <p> rate function I () is identified with the fol lowing form: for any 2 D (<ref> [0; 1] </ref>; IR), I () = 0 fl fl ( 0 (t))dt; if 2 AC 0 ([0; 1]; IR); 1; otherwise where AC 0 ([0; 1]; IR) is the space of absolutely continuous functions from [0; 1] to IR with (0) = 0, and 0 (t) is the derivative of (t). <p> Now using the fact that fA (t) (s); 0 s 1; t 2 INg satisfies the sample path large deviation principle, we have lim inf 1 log P rfB (t)=t &gt; ffg inf f : min 0&lt;s1 f (s)ffsg&gt;0g Z 1 fl fl where is an absolutely continuous function on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and (0) = 0. We show the right hand side of (66) equals inf xff fl fl B (x). If ff &lt; Ea (0) (this is always true if Ea (0) &gt; c, as ff c), then from the definition of fl fl B (ff) = 0. <p> Hence, inf f: min 0&lt;s1 f (s)ffsg&gt;0g Z 1 fl fl xff B (ff); and thus (64) holds when ff &lt; Ea (0). We now consider the case ff Ea (0). Necessarily we have Ea (0) c, as ff c.

However, in the stochastic setting, the tightness of the upper bounds is still an open question. Answer to this question has implications in call admission control with QoS guarantees for networks employing GPS schedulers [27].

Reference-contexts: For application of large deviation theory in communication networks, see the excellent survey paper <ref> [23] </ref>. Zhi-Li Zhang / Large Deviations and GPS for a Two-Queue System 4 is continuous in int (domfl fl ). Moreover, if ff 2 domfl fl is the left end point of domfl fl , then fl fl (x) is right-continuous at ff. <p> Large deviation theory has been widely applied in queueing theory to study the tail probabilities of various queueing systems (see <ref> [23] </ref> and the references therein). Of particular relevance to us are the results on the discrete-time G/ D/ 1/ 1 queueing system. The presentation below follows closely the formulation in [5]. Throughout the paper, all time indices are integers.

Reference-contexts: The performance of GPS has been studied in both deterministic [20, 21] and stochastic setting [25, 28, 19] using the so-called bounding approach [18]. For sources conforming to certain general bounding source models [11] and <ref> [24] </ref>, upper bounds on metrics such as loss or delay are derived. In the deterministic case, Parekh and Gallager [20, 21] show that the upper bounds are attainable in the worst-case. However, in the stochastic setting, the tightness of the upper bounds is still an open question.

Reference-contexts: We establish the optimal asymptotic decay rate of the queue length tail distribution of each session by applying the theory of large deviation. Results for the general multiple-queue GPS system can be found in <ref> [26] </ref>. The result for the two-queue GPS system was first stated in [14] under weaker assumptions than ours. However, they provide a non-rigorous heuristic proof based on a Loynes-type argument [17]. <p> Our proof uses the sample-path large deviation principle. Extension of the result to a general multiple-queue GPS system is presented in <ref> [26] </ref>. We have looked at the discrete-time GPS system. The results of the paper may be extended to the continuous-time model by imposing appropriate conditions on the continuous-time arrival processes.

Reference-contexts: However, in the stochastic setting, the tightness of the upper bounds is still an open question. Answer to this question has implications in call admission control with QoS guarantees for networks employing GPS schedulers <ref> [27] </ref>. In this paper, we focus on a GPS system with two sessions, each having its own queue. Under this special case, bandwidth sharing of the two sessions in the system can be easily captured.
