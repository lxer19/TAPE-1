Title: Evolving Legged Locomotion of Virtual Creatures  
Author: Daniel Nikovski 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Southern Illinois University at Carbondale  
Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) systems require realistic simulation of artificial worlds inhabited by virtual creatures. The complex behavior of these creatures has to be guided by intelligent control systems. The paper discusses experiments on combining an explicit planning method with evolutionary computation techniques for the creation of a control system for a six-legged virtual creature modeled in a physically-based simulation environment. The chosen approach permits the incorporation of both explicit and learned knowledge in the control strategy of the virtual autonomous agent.
