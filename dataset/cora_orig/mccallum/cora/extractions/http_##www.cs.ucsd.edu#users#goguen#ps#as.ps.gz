Title: An Introduction to Algebraic Semiotics, with Application to User Interface Design  
Author: Joseph Goguen 
Address: San Diego  
Affiliation: Dept. Computer Science Engineering Univ. of California at  
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to user interface design and other areas, called algebraic semiotics. The approach is based on a notion of sign, which allows complex hierarchical structure and incorporates the insight (emphasized by Saussure) that signs come in systems, and should be studied at that level, rather than individually. A user interface can be considered as a representation of the underlying functionality to which it provides access, and thus user interface design can be considered a craft of constructing such representations, where both the interface and the underlying functionality are considered as (structured) sign systems. In this setting, representations appear as mappings, or morphisms, between sign systems, which should preserve as much structure as possible. This motivates developing a calculus having systematic ways to combine signs, sign systems, and representations. One important mode of composition is blending, introduced by Fauconnier and Turner; we relate this to certain concepts from the very abstract area of mathematics called category theory. Applications for algebraic semiotics include not only user interface design, but also cognitive linguistics, especially metaphor theory and cognitive poetics. The main contribution of this paper is the precision it can bring to such areas. Building on an insight from computer science, that discrete structures can be described by algebraic theories, sign systems are defined to be algebraic theories with extra structure, and semiotic morphisms are defined to be mappings of algebraic theories that also preserve the extra structure. We also study ways of comparing the quality of representations, as an aid to practical design.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, a sign x is an index for an object y if x and y are regularly connected, in the sense "that always or usually when there is an x, there is also a y in some more or less exactly specifiable spatio-temporal relation to the x in question" <ref> [1] </ref>. "Such, for instance, is a piece of mould with a bullet-hole in it as sign of a shot" [41]. In this example, the spatio-temporal relation is a causal one, which applies with great generality.

Reference-contexts: This whole/part hierarchical structure puts each sign in a context of other signs with which it forms still higher level signs. Note the recursivity in the definition of windows. More recent uses of sign systems, for example in the classic literary study S/Z by Roland Barthes <ref> [4] </ref>, tend to be less rigid than the linguistics of Saussure or the anthropology of Levi-Strauss.

Reference-contexts: But the descriptions should never be confused with "reality". In contrast with situation theory <ref> [5] </ref>, we do not consider that signs and representations are pre-existing residents of some Platonic heaven, but instead claim that they arise in a context of social interaction.

Let us call this the default negation assumption. But sometimes whether or not a relation holds may be unknown. Humans generally do a good job of figuring all this out, using what is called "common sense".

Reference-contexts: Conversely, we may be given some situation, and want to find the best way to describe it in natural language, or in some other medium or combination of media, such as text with photos, or cartoon sequences, or video, or online hypertext or hypermedia <ref> [24] </ref>. In these and many other cases, representations are signs in one system that relate systematically to signs in another system. Generally it is just as fruitless to study representations of single signs as to study single isolated signs. <p> We have already discussed the work of Peirce and Saussure; this brief subsection only sketches a few especially closely related items of more recent vintage. First is joint work with Linde begun more than 15 years ago <ref> [24] </ref>, which contains the seeds for the main ideas of this paper. The influence of pioneers Saussure [46] and Peirce [41] is of course pervasive. <p> One example of sorts in the sense that we intend is so called parts of speech, such as noun and verb, for syntax. 6 ordering, not total. Experiments of Goguen and Linde <ref> [24] </ref> (testing subjects after multimedia instruc-tion in various formats about a simple electronic device) support the hypothesis that the reasoning discourse type [28] has a primary constructor that conjoins reasons supporting a statement 4 . <p> For example, there is a connector from object to house (though we have not drawn it, as Fauconnier and Turner would). A natural task in the experiments of <ref> [24] </ref> is to describe the condition of four lights on the face of an experimental device. <p> This might seem undesirable, but if representations in S 2 get too complex, they will not be useful in practice. For example, if S 1 is English sentences and S 2 is bracket notation, then the representation (from the data of <ref> [24] </ref>) [[[[the] Det [light] N ] NP [[on] P rep [[the] Det [left ] N ] NP ] PP ] NP [[comes] V [on] P art ] VP ] Sent is not as useful for human communication as a linear representation would be. <p> But what would it mean for a morphism M : TXT ! STG not to preserve this structure? There are many possibilities, including dropping some characters, words, and/or sentences, and permuting them in a random order. Phenomena like these will clearly produce a low quality display. Experiments reported in <ref> [24] </ref> show that preserving high levels is more important than preserving priorities, which in turn is more important than preserving content. They also show a strong tendency to preserve higher levels at the expense of lower levels. <p> This may be surprising, because of emphasis by cognitive psychologists on the "basic level" of lexical concepts (e.g., "bird", see Rosch [42, 43]). For natural language, the sentential level was long considered to be basic, but research like that of <ref> [24] </ref> shows that the discourse level is higher in our technical sense, and thus more important. This is consistent with the important general principle that structure has priority over content, i.e., form is more important than content (if something has to be sacrificed, in a sufficiently complex display).

Reference-contexts: The essential idea is that interfaces, representations, metaphors, interpretations, etc. are morphisms from one sign system to another. User interfaces for computer systems can be seen as morphisms from an underlying abstract machine (what the system does) into a sign systems of windows, buttons, menus, etc. <ref> [27] </ref>. Each web browser can be seen as providing a semiotic morphism from html (plus JavaScript, etc.) into the capabilities of a particular computer on which it is running.

Reference-contexts: In narrative, if one sentence follows another we assume they are connected by a sequence constructor; this is called the narrative presupposition <ref> [34] </ref>. 5 An additional assumption that is explained later is needed to show the equivalence of these two axioms. 7 char / " alphanum spec / " alpha num where of course alpha and num are also subsorts of char.

Reference-contexts: We build on work of cognitive linguists Lakoff, Johnson and others <ref> [35] </ref> on metaphors, and Fauconnier and Turner's exciting proposal of blending as a fundamental cognitive operation for metaphor, grammar, etc. [10, 11]; see also [50]. Shneiderman [47] gives a good overview of user interface design issues. <p> 1 ~ = S , 15 The form of this diagram is "upside down" from that used by Fauconnier and Turner, in that our arrows go up, with the generic G on the bottom, and the blend B on the top; this is consistent with the metaphor (or "image scheme" <ref> [35] </ref>) that "up is more" as well as with conventions for drawing such diagrams in mathematics. Also, Fauconnier and Turner do not include the map G ! B. 16 This involves renaming sorts and operations, if necessary, so that there are no overlaps except for the data sorts and operations.

Reference-contexts: This conceptual revolution took a more definite and systematic form with the invention of category theory in the early 1940's by Eilenberg and Mac Lane; see <ref> [36] </ref>. Technical developments within category theory have in turn spurred further and deeper uses of morphisms within mathematics, and more recently in applied fields like computer science.

Reference-contexts: For example, Latour <ref> [37] </ref> shows how representation by cartographic maps was essential for European colonization, and Bowers [6] discusses the politics of formalism, including cscw systems. Latour leaves representation undefined, while Bowers has a slightly formal notion of formalism. <p> In fact, we often want what Latour <ref> [37] </ref> calls a re-representation, which concentrates or abstracts information. For example, the representation "[NP PP ]VP " is more useful than that above for some purposes, precisely because it omits some information. Statistics, such as the mean and median of a population, are also re-representations in this sense.

Reference-contexts: It is now an interesting exercise to prove that the two different equations expressing the cyclic nature of days are equivalent for reachable models. 9 A technical condition called initiality is needed for this; a survey of this and related results is given in <ref> [40] </ref>. 10 fascinating examples. For example, Latour [37] shows how representation by cartographic maps was essential for European colonization, and Bowers [6] discusses the politics of formalism, including cscw systems. Latour leaves representation undefined, while Bowers has a slightly formal notion of formalism.

Reference-contexts: Charles Sanders Peirce <ref> [41] </ref>, a nineteenth century logician and philosopher working in Boston, coined the word "semiotics" and introduced many of its basic concepts. <p> First is joint work with Linde begun more than 15 years ago [24], which contains the seeds for the main ideas of this paper. The influence of pioneers Saussure [46] and Peirce <ref> [41] </ref> is of course pervasive. Analogies and file names were studied by Gentner [13] and Carroll [8] respectively, using set theoretic formalisms that emphasize structure, but without axioms, levels or constructors; Sacks' ethnomethodological notion of "category system" [44] seems similar to our notion of sign system, but is very informal. <p> For example, the representation "[NP PP ]VP " is more useful than that above for some purposes, precisely because it omits some information. Statistics, such as the mean and median of a population, are also re-representations in this sense. Peirce <ref> [41] </ref> also introduced the well-known three-fold classification of signs into icon, index, and symbol. These terms have a precise technical meaning that differs from their everyday use. <p> in the sense "that always or usually when there is an x, there is also a y in some more or less exactly specifiable spatio-temporal relation to the x in question" [1]. "Such, for instance, is a piece of mould with a bullet-hole in it as sign of a shot" <ref> [41] </ref>. In this example, the spatio-temporal relation is a causal one, which applies with great generality. However many indices only work in particular spatio-temporal contexts, e.g., the use of first names for persons.

Reference-contexts: They also show a strong tendency to preserve higher levels at the expense of lower levels. This may be surprising, because of emphasis by cognitive psychologists on the "basic level" of lexical concepts (e.g., "bird", see Rosch <ref> [42, 43] </ref>). For natural language, the sentential level was long considered to be basic, but research like that of [24] shows that the discourse level is higher in our technical sense, and thus more important.

Reference-contexts: In a sense, this paper proposes a general theory of meaning, although it denies the possibility of traditional context-independent meaning. The social nature of information is discussed in [20], using ideas from ethnomethodology <ref> [45] </ref>. Familiarity with (a little bit of) OBJ3 and algebraic specification is needed for the examples in Appendix A, and familiarity with basic category theory is needed for Appendix B; references for these two topics are [25] and [29, 15, 16], respectively.

In addition, we use the term signal for a physical configuration that may or may not be a sign.

Reference-contexts: For another example, a source sign system might contain instructions for repairing some piece of equipment, with target sign system a non-color graphics screen plus a speech chip. We can then ask how to generate instructional material using these particular capabilities in the most effective way. Star <ref> [48] </ref> introduced the notion of boundary object, which (for our purposes) can be seen as a sign system that is interpreted in different ways by different social groups. <p> A sighting may first appear as a field notebook entry, and then move into the two very different contexts. (A similar example is given in <ref> [48] </ref>.) 12 Think about why a clock modulo 720 might work, but (say) modulo 120 or modulo 300 would not work; what about modulo 360? Why? Hint: consider the context in which the representation is typically used.
