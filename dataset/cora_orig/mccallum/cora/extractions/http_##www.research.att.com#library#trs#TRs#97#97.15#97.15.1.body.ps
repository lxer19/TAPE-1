Abstract: By using totally isotropic subspaces in an orthogonal space + (2i; 2), several infinite families of packings of 2 k -dimensional subspaces of real 2 i -dimensional space are constructed, some of which are shown to be optimal packings. A certain Clifford group underlies the construction and links this problem with Barnes-Wall lattices, Kerdock sets and quantum-error-correcting codes.

Reference-contexts: The algebraic framework The following machinery was used in [7] to construct Kerdock sets, among other things, and in [8], [9] to construct quantum error-correcting codes. The starting point is the standard method of associating a finite orthogonal space to an extraspecial 2-group, as described for example in <ref> [2] </ref>, Theorem 23.10, or [15], Theorem 13.8. The end result will be the construction of various packings of n-spaces in a parent space V = R m , where m = 2 i . <p> As in <ref> [2] </ref>, Theorem 23.10 we define a quadratic form Q : E ! F 2 by Q (g) = 0 if g 2 = +I for g 2 E, where g 2 E is any preimage of g, and so Q ( X (a) Y (b)) = a b.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The central problem is to arrange N n-dimensional subspaces of R m so they are as far apart as possible. Numerous constructions and bounds were given in <ref> [10] </ref>, [20] (see also [21]). In the present paper we give an algebraic framework for constructing such arrangements that explains all the examples constructed or conjectured in [20]. The two main constructions obtained by these methods are stated in Theorems 1 and 2. <p> G (m; n) will denote the Grassmannian space of n-dimensional subspaces of R m . We shall refer to the elements of G (m; n) as n-dimensional planes, or simply planes. For reasons discussed in <ref> [10] </ref>, we define the distance between two n-dimensional planes P; Q in R m by d (P; Q) = sin 2 1 + : : : + sin 2 n ; (1) where 1 ; : : : ; n are the principal angles 1 between P and Q. <p> We refer to <ref> [10] </ref> for applications and earlier references. It was shown in [10] that G (m; n) equipped with the metric (1) has an isometric embedding in R D ; D = (m 1)(m + 2)=2, obtained by representing each plane P 2 G (m; n) by the orthogonal projection from R m <p> We refer to <ref> [10] </ref> for applications and earlier references. It was shown in [10] that G (m; n) equipped with the metric (1) has an isometric embedding in R D ; D = (m 1)(m + 2)=2, obtained by representing each plane P 2 G (m; n) by the orthogonal projection from R m to P . <p> 2 i -dimensional Barnes-Wall lattice together with their images under H (cf. [11], p. 151). 4 With i = 2; k = 1 and i = 3; k = 2 we obtain two important special cases: 18 planes in G (4; 2) and 70 planes in G (8; 4) (cf. <ref> [10] </ref>, [20]). More generally, when k = i 1 we obtain the packing of f (i) = 2 (2 i 1)(2 i1 + 1) planes in G (2 i ; 2 i1 ) with d 2 = 2 i2 that is the main result of [20]. <p> These are suboptimal however, since packings of 44 planes in G (8; 2) with d 2 = 1:5 were obtained in <ref> [10] </ref>. For i = 4, k = 1; ` = 0, the graph on 3-spaces has 2025 nodes and contains cliques of size 17 (which is probably maximal), leading to packings of 136 planes in G (16; 2) with d 2 = 1:75. <p> An infinite family of packings meeting the simplex bound A packing of 28 planes in G (7; 3) meeting the simplex bound of (3) was given in <ref> [10] </ref>. This may be generalized as follows. Let p be a prime which is either 3 or congruent to 1 modulo 8, so that a Hadamard matrix H of order (p + 1)=2 exists. <p> 2, taking k = 3 we find that the planes P 0 ; : : : ; P 3 are generated by d 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 1 0 0 0 C e ; where the product of the signs is +1 (as given in <ref> [10] </ref>). The full set of 28 planes is obtained by cycling the seven coordinates. Changing k to 6 we obtain a packing with the same distances but in which some of the principal angles have changed, showing that the packings of Theorem 3 are not unique. <p> Packings obtained from Theorem 3 are labeled "(3)" in Table I. 9 6. A table Table I lists the parameters of the packings constructed in this paper in dimensions up to 128. When better packings with same parameters were given in <ref> [10] </ref>, these are also mentioned. In the last column, "(1)" refers to Theorem 1, "(1a)" to the packings described at the end of Section 3, "(2a)"; : : : ; "(2e)" to the examples following Theorem 2, and "(3)" to Theorem 3. <p> We must stress however that a very large number of other packings are known, especially in dimensions up to 16: see the constructions and tables in <ref> [10] </ref> and [21]. 10 Table I. <p> Parameters of Grassmannian Packings constructed in this paper m n N d 2 source 3 1 6 4/5 (3) 4 1 24 1/2 (1) 4 2 6 1 (2d) 4 2 18 1 (1) 8 1 240 1/2 (1) 8 2 20 1.5789: : : <ref> [10] </ref> 8 2 44 3/2 [10] 8 3 1680 1/2 (1a) 16 1 144 15/16 (2a) 16 2 72 7/4 (2d) 16 2 1040 3/2 (2c) 16 3 151200 1/2 (1a) 16 4 180 3 (2b) 16 5 453600 1/2 (1a) 16 7 64800 1/2 (1a) 23 11 276 144/25 (3) <p> Parameters of Grassmannian Packings constructed in this paper m n N d 2 source 3 1 6 4/5 (3) 4 1 24 1/2 (1) 4 2 6 1 (2d) 4 2 18 1 (1) 8 1 240 1/2 (1) 8 2 20 1.5789: : : <ref> [10] </ref> 8 2 44 3/2 [10] 8 3 1680 1/2 (1a) 16 1 144 15/16 (2a) 16 2 72 7/4 (2d) 16 2 1040 3/2 (2c) 16 3 151200 1/2 (1a) 16 4 180 3 (2b) 16 5 453600 1/2 (1a) 16 7 64800 1/2 (1a) 23 11 276 144/25 (3) 32 1 146880 1/2 (1)
