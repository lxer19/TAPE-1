Abstract: A set is called NP-immune if it does not contain any intnite NP subsets, and NP-simple if it lies in NP, and its complement is NP-immune. Hartmanis, Li and Yehsa [12] proved in 1986 that no m-hard (many-one hard) set for NP is NP-immune unless NP SUBEXP. On the other hand we can exhibit a relativized world in which there is an NP-simple set that is complete under Cook reductions, even conjunctive reductions. We can therefore ask to what extent the original result generalizes to reductions which lie in strength in between many-one and Turing reductions. We show that no positive bounded truth-table complete set for NP is NP-simple, unless UP SUBEXP. Under the stronger assumption that UP "coUP 6 SUBEXP it is even true that no bounded truth-table complete set for NP is NP-simple. Further results for dierent reductions are shown including a similar theorem about NEXP which does not require any assumptions. We derive the results by the use of inseparable sets. This technique turns out to be very powerful in the study of truth-table and even (honest) Turing reductions.

Reference-contexts: To avoid confusion we will prefer the full names NP-immune and NP-simple. NP-immune sets exist: any immune set is NP-immune. The case with NP-simple sets is more dicult, and it took a rather long time (after several initial attempts) till Balczar <ref> [1] </ref> proved in 1985 that relative to some computable oracle an NP-simple set exists. Recently it was shown by Vereshchagin [25] that relative to a random oracle an NP-simple set exists. More on this topic can be found in Section 9.

Reference-contexts: We will have frequent recourse to concepts from computability without actually detning them, since they only serve as illustration and are not essential. The interested reader will tnd the missing detnitions in either Odifreddi [19] or Soare [22]. As references for complexity theory we mention Balczar, Diaz, Gabarr <ref> [2] </ref> and Papadimitriou [20]. Some short remarks on notation: honest reductions will be marked by an h added to the the reduction sign. For example A h btt B means that A honest bounded truth-table reduces to B. <p> In particular NP-immune and NP-simple can be used to tackle IC, and these notions might prove more exible than sparseness. Historical background on NP-immunity and NP-simplicity can be found in the second volume of Balczar et al. <ref> [2] </ref> from which the above detnition is taken. Note that this text (like some others) abbreviates NP-simple to simple. To avoid confusion we will prefer the full names NP-immune and NP-simple. NP-immune sets exist: any immune set is NP-immune. <p> Moreover, S A is f (n)-c-complete via the reduction x 7! Query (x). 2 Proof of Lemma 9.2. Our construction is loosely based on one by Balczar <ref> [2, Theorem 7.11] </ref>, but ours is complicated by the fact that our L A must be quite dense, whereas Balczar et al. relied heavily on their L A being very sparse.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 8.10 A btt-hard set for EXP is not NEXP-simple. Corollary 8.11 (Buhrman, 1997) No btt-complete set for NEXP is NEXP-simple. The corollary was trst reported by Buhrman with a proof using a txed-point construction. Buhrman improved his construction to yield our Theorem 8.10 by incorporating the Denisov idea <ref> [3] </ref>. 16 9 Relativizations We do not expect NP-simplicity to carry us far beyond bounded truth-table reductions, and this expectation is made precise by constructing a relativized world, in which there is an (honest) conjunctively complete NP-simple set although UP 6 SUBEXP.

Reference-contexts: One advantage is that we can dispense with hypotheses. But let us trst recall what is already known. The following account is based on Buhrman <ref> [4] </ref>. In his PhD thesis Berman proved that all m-complete sets for EXP are in fact one-to-one, length-increasing m-complete. Hence an m-complete set for EXP will not be P-immune, since for example the tally set f0 n : n 2 !g reduces to it via a one-to-one, length-increasing reduction. <p> Fact 8.1 (Berman, 1977) No m-complete set for EXP is P-immune. On the other hand it is easy to construct a counterexample for 2-tt-reductions. Fact 8.2 (Buhrman <ref> [4] </ref>) There is a 2-d-complete set for EXP which is P-immune. The case for NEXP seemed more dicult. It was proved by Homer and Wang [18] that every m-complete set for NE and its complement contain dense E"UP subsets. Finally Tran [24] extended the Berman result to NEXP . <p> Since it had been proven earlier by Buhrman, Spaan, and Torenvliet that a 1-tt-complete set for NEXP is also m-complete the following corollary was immediate. Fact 8.4 (Tran [24]) No 1-tt-complete set for NEXP is P-immune. Again this seems to be the limit. Fact 8.5 (Buhrman <ref> [4] </ref>) There is a 2-d-complete set for NEXP which is P-immune. But not quite. It should be observed that Tran's proof actually yields results for conjunctive and disjunctive reductions as well. 15 Theorem 8.6 A conjunctively complete set for NEXP is not P-immune.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In 1944 Post published his epochal paper on Recursively enumerable sets of positive integers and their decision problems (reprinted in Davis <ref> [5] </ref>). With this paper he initiated a line of research in computability theory 1 which has since become famous as Post's program. To settle the question of whether there are incomplete, c.e., noncomputable degrees he pursued a simple, but productive idea. <p> Throughout the whole text will denote the alphabet f0; 1g unless it is used to denote a sum. 2 Immunity and Simplicity The concepts of immunity and simplicity have a long tradition in computability theory starting with Post's paper <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 Detnition 2.1 A set is C-immune if it is intnite and does not contain an intnite subset which lies in C. A set is C-simple if it is in C and its complement is C-immune. <p> But NP-maximal sets do no exist. This follows from a result of Breidbart's on splittings by P-sets, and was observed by Homer and Maass [16]. 3 Inseparability Inseparability was trst used by Rosser <ref> [5] </ref> in 1936 in connection with extensions of Gdel's Theorem. Since then it has been very successful as a clean and easy tool to deal with reductions [8]. This paper tries to show that the same is true for the complexity theoretic setting.

Reference-contexts: Apparently this easy way of converting A and B into complete sets was trst observed by Dubhashi <ref> [6] </ref>. Grollmann and Selman [11] use a dierent construction which additionally allows us to let A (or B) be any specitc m-complete set (like SAT). 2 There is an easier way of getting inseparable sets (mentioned by Dubhashi) which does not need any assumptions on C.

Reference-contexts: Are there other assumptions under which inseparable sets exist, other constructions which allow better hypotheses? Or the tnal challenge: is there a necessary and sucient condition for the existence of inseparable sets? In this context we should mention a paper by Fenner, Fortnow, Naik and Rogers <ref> [7] </ref> which investigates two propositions: Q and Q' which might be closely related to inseparable sets. On the other hand an even stronger case could be made for inseparable sets if further applications can be found. A possible candidate would be Selman's p-selectivity (or superterseness).

Reference-contexts: This paper should also be interesting from a methodological point of view through its use of inseparable sets. In computability theory inseparable sets have long proved to be a rich source of results <ref> [8, 19, 22] </ref> and this paper hopes to show that the same can be true for complexity theory. This appears to be the trst time inseparable sets are applied to the study to resource bounded reductions. <p> Furthermore it is immediate from the detnition that any NP-(k + 1)-immune set is also NP-k-immune. More surprisingly there is a rather unexpected connection with NP-simplicity. The computability version of the following lemma is a folklore result <ref> [8, Lemma 2.2] </ref>. The lemma is implicit in Yamakami's manuscript [26]. Lemma 2.3 If A is NP-simple, then A is NP-k-immune for every k. Proof. Assume that A 2 NP, and there is an honest np-k-array f 2 NPSV such that A"f (x) 6= ; for all x. <p> Since then it has been very successful as a clean and easy tool to deal with reductions <ref> [8] </ref>. This paper tries to show that the same is true for the complexity theoretic setting. Detnition 3.1 Two disjoint sets A and B are called C-inseparable, if there is no C 2 C for which A C B.

Reference-contexts: We will write p-separator instead of P-separator, and s-separator instead of SUBEXP-separator. Grollmann and Selman proved that p-separators exist unless P = UP, which is considered to be unlikely. Fact 3.3 (Grollmann and Selman <ref> [11] </ref>) If P 6= UP then there are two disjoint NP-complete sets which are not separated by any set in P . <p> Apparently this easy way of converting A and B into complete sets was trst observed by Dubhashi [6].

Reference-contexts: The use of eective thinness notions in complexity theory to obtain results on strong reductions goes back to a paper by Hartmanis, Li and Yesha <ref> [12] </ref> published in 1986. In this paper it was proved that every m-hard (many-one hard) set for NP has an intnite NP subset unless NP SUBEXP. We could also express this as saying that no m-hard set for NP is NP-immune (unless, of course, NP SUBEXP). <p> Since E is an s-separator if E is, and E m M implies that E m M , we can conclude that M is not NP-immune. 2 This result is not the best possible for m-reductions. Hartmanis et al. <ref> [12] </ref> showed that no m-hard set can be NP-immune, unless NP SUBEXP, and no m-hard set can be co-NP-immune unless NP " coNP SUBEXP. Fact 5.5 (Hartmanis et al. [12]) Every m-hard set for NP has an intnite, dense subset in NP unless NP SUBEXP. <p> Hartmanis et al. <ref> [12] </ref> showed that no m-hard set can be NP-immune, unless NP SUBEXP, and no m-hard set can be co-NP-immune unless NP " coNP SUBEXP.

Reference-contexts: In particular we do not know of any probable combination of assumptions that would entail the existence (or nonexistence) of an NP-simple set. Homer <ref> [13] </ref> tries to circumvent the problem by introducing k-simple sets in analogy with the k-creative sets of Joseph and Young. We will not pursue this line of research here.

Reference-contexts: This gives us a separator of A and B in P=subexp.

As references for complexity theory we mention Balczar, Diaz, Gabarr [2] and Papadimitriou [20]. Some short remarks on notation: honest reductions will be marked by an h added to the the reduction sign. <p> Instead we will make use of NP-hyperimmunity. For truth-table reductions we cannot hope to prove the very convenient Lemma 6.3 which allowed us to consider txed truth-tables only. This makes a new approach necessary. As a matter of fact the main inspiration comes from Denisov's proof <ref> [19, Exercise III.6.23] </ref> that if B is part of a computably inseparable pair of c.e. sets, and B (computably) truth-table reduces to A, then A is not hyperimmune. As in the bounded case the proof for the honest case is easy and goes through with Turing reductions. <p> The bound on the running time is the main dierence between Turing reductions in computability and complexity, and it leads to the fact that in complexity we can deal with Turing reductions using only hyperimmunity, whereas in computability not even maximality is good enough (there are Turing complete maximal sets <ref> [19, 22] </ref>). Theorem 7.2 No NP-hyperimmune set can be h-T-hard for NP unless P = UP. The proof isas usualsplit up into several parts. It follows from the following lemma together with Lemma 3.4, and the observation that P = UP if and only if UP P=2 (using self-reducibility).

Reference-contexts: NP-immune sets exist: any immune set is NP-immune. The case with NP-simple sets is more dicult, and it took a rather long time (after several initial attempts) till Balczar [1] proved in 1985 that relative to some computable oracle an NP-simple set exists. Recently it was shown by Vereshchagin <ref> [25] </ref> that relative to a random oracle an NP-simple set exists. More on this topic can be found in Section 9. Apart from the observation that the existence of an NP-simple set is a strong indication that NP 6= coNP, our knowledge of NP-simple sets is very limited.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore it is immediate from the detnition that any NP-(k + 1)-immune set is also NP-k-immune. More surprisingly there is a rather unexpected connection with NP-simplicity. The computability version of the following lemma is a folklore result [8, Lemma 2.2]. The lemma is implicit in Yamakami's manuscript <ref> [26] </ref>. Lemma 2.3 If A is NP-simple, then A is NP-k-immune for every k. Proof. Assume that A 2 NP, and there is an honest np-k-array f 2 NPSV such that A"f (x) 6= ; for all x. Let m = lim sup x2 fl jA " f (x)j. <p> Theorem 4.1 No set h-btt-hard for NP is NP-simple unless P = UP. Theorem 4.2 No set h-d-hard for NP is co-NP-immune (let alone NP-simple) unless P = UP. Theorem 4.3 No set h-T -hard for NP is NP-hyperimmune unless P = UP. Yamakami <ref> [26] </ref> proves a weaker version of the second theorem; it only applies to d-reductions that are forced to be honest on all inputs. Our detnition of an honest disjunctive reduction is more generous and can be found in the next section. <p> Theorem 4.7 No set btt-hard for NP can be NP-simple unless UP " coUP SUBEXP. Note that we need UP " coUP 6 SUBEXP for the last theorem rather than UP 6 SUBEXP. This will be explained later. The last result was claimed by Yamakami <ref> [26] </ref> (under the weaker hypothesis that NP 6 SUBEXP), but we are as yet unable to verify the proof. We will show the result to be a corollary of the proof of the next theorem.
