Abstract: In developing telerobotics systems, it is desirable to be able to predict the effect of adding or replacing system components on the overall system's performance capacities. By appropriately stressing performance dimensions of a system and characterizing its behavior, we can develop a model that will describe the system quantitatively in terms of its total available "performance resources". If the resource availability is greater than or equal to the resource demands for a given task, we can predict successful completion for the task. Using this approach, we can characterize new intelligent components and predict their performance in a given task. Results of a tele-operation experiment are included which yield a system performance capacity envelope for a telerobotics system.

The testing methodology is based on a performance theory which yields a quantitative characterization of the system and subsystems and provides a means of predicting performance in previously untried tasks. It emphasizes a maximal demand strategy (vs. more commonly employed behavior-oriented strategies) [7].

Reference-contexts: In some contexts, high fidelity representations are required and the additional effort is warranted. Tracking tasks can also be used to measure performance of autonomous localization systems, such as TRAC <ref> [3] </ref>. The TRAC (Targeting and Reflective Alignment Concept) system is a single-camera localization and tracking system. In testing the performance of TRAC, we cannot assume equal results for all three translational axes or for the three rotational axes.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The term telerobotics has been used to represent human control of remote subsystems, including supervisory control of autonomous components [2]. In general, the evaluation of telerobotics systems has been task-oriented. That is, can an operator accomplish a particular task and how long does it take <ref> [4] </ref>? Although this provides an indication of whether the system works for that particular task, it does nothing to characterize the performance of the components or indicate where the limitations and weaknesses exist. <p> Measurements for contact tasks are taken along the dimensions of contact smoothness <ref> [4] </ref>, task speed, task skill, and command efficiency. Two test runs are used to stress the system. First, the operator is instructed to perform the task as fast as possible. Secondly, the operator performs the task as smoothly as possible (i.e., with minimum force and torque).
