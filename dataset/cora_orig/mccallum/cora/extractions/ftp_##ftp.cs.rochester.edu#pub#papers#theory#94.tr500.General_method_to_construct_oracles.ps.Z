Title: A General Method to Construct Oracles Realizing Given Relationships between Complexity Classes  
Author: Andrei A. Muchnik Nikolai K. Vereshchagin flyz 
Abstract: We present a method to prove oracle results of the following type. Let K 1 , : : :, K 2n , and L 1 , : : :, L 2m be complexity classes. Our method provides a general framework for constructing an oracle A such that K A 2i for i = 1; : : :; n and L A 2j for j = 1; : : : ; m. Using that method we prove several results of this kind. The hardest of them is the existence of an oracle A such that P A 6= NP A , P A = BPP A , and both Co-NP A -sets and NP A -sets are P A -separable. We exhibit also two theorems that cannot be proved by that method.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction When people realized that P 6= NP is likely true but hard to prove (and impossible to prove by relativizable arguments <ref> [BGS 75] </ref>), they began to prove interesting theorems under P 6= NP hypothesis. Interesting problems of this kind arise in cryptography, where the reliability of all known protocols is based on complexity assumptions even stronger than P 6= NP. <p> The following results among them deal with the classes considered in the present paper. Rackoff in [R 78] constructed oracles A and B such that P A = R A 6= NP A and P B 6= R B = NP B . In <ref> [BGS 75] </ref>, it was proved that P 6= NP " Co-NP 6= NP under some oracle. In the present paper we prove, for example, that there exists an oracle under which P 6= NP and NP-sets are separable, thus we solve the problem left open in [GS 88]. <p> In other words, it is impossible to prove by relativizable arguments even the disjunction "NP-sets are inseparable or Co-NP-sets are inseparable or P 6= BPP" under P 6= NP hypothesis. The method to solve such problems goes back to <ref> [BGS 75] </ref>. We call it "the universum method". In a sense the method may be viewed as forcing method in the general form (see subsection 3.2.1). <p> Proof. The proof of this theorem is very close to the proof of the theorem from <ref> [BGS 75] </ref> stating that P A = NP A " Co-NP A 6= NP A for some oracle A. <p> Besides that general theorems we use one more tool due to <ref> [BGS 75] </ref>. New proof of Theorem 2.1. Consider the universum defined as follows. De fine the sequence of integers n (i) by induction n (0) = 1, n (i + 1) = 2 2 n (i) . <p> The problem whether 28 Table 1: P = NP NP-sets are separable Co-NP-sets are separable P = NP P = BPP P = R "Co-R Commentary 1 + + + + + + <ref> [BGS 75] </ref> 2 + + + Theorem 4.12 3 + + Unknown 4 + + Unknown 5 + + + Theorem 4.4 6 + + Theorem 4.7 7 + + Theorem 4.6 8 + + + Theorem 4.2 9 + + Unknown 10 + + Unknown 11 + + Theorem 4.5

Reference-contexts: In [BGS 75], it was proved that P 6= NP " Co-NP 6= NP under some oracle. In the present paper we prove, for example, that there exists an oracle under which P 6= NP and NP-sets are separable, thus we solve the problem left open in <ref> [GS 88] </ref>. This implies that reliability of all the cryptographi-cal schemes based on the existence of one-way functions cannot be derived from P 6= NP by relativizable arguments (since one-way functions do not exist if NP-sets are separable).

Reference-contexts: In Section 3 we prove three general theorems on the universum method, which will considerably simplify all its further applications. In Section 4 we obtain specific result applying our method. In particular, we give a simple proof of the result by <ref> [HI 86] </ref> that there exists an oracle relative to which P 6= NP " Co-NP 6= NP and NP " Co-NP has a complete problem. <p> Theorem 4.13 (Hartmanis and Immerman <ref> [HI 86] </ref>). There exists an oracle A such that P A 6= NP A " Co-NP A 6= NP A and the class NP A " Co-NP A has an m-complete language. Proof.

Reference-contexts: Many results of this sort (when an oracle is constructed under which some boolean combination of complexity assertions is true) appeared in literature. The following results among them deal with the classes considered in the present paper. Rackoff in <ref> [R 78] </ref> constructed oracles A and B such that P A = R A 6= NP A and P B 6= R B = NP B . In [BGS 75], it was proved that P 6= NP " Co-NP 6= NP under some oracle. <p> To prove Theorem 5.1, one needs a lower bound by [H 86, Y 85] on complexity of computation of PARITY function by means of AND,OR-circuits of bounded depth, which has a rather complicated proof. Theorem 5.2 was proved in the paper <ref> [R 78] </ref> (in fact a less strong asertion that P 6= R = N P under some oracle was proved there but the proof is good also for our case).

Reference-contexts: For example, the implication P A = NP A ) P A = BPP A is true by the well known Sipser's result BPP A A 4 (P.Gacs improved that result to BPP A A 2 <ref> [S 83] </ref>). We apply the universum method to prove the existence of oracles under which one or another combination of assertions that label the nodes of the graph holds. There are 17 possible combinations of those assertions. They are listed in the Table 1.
