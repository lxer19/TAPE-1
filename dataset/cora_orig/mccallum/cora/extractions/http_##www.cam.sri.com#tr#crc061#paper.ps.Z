Abstract: We describe how substantial domain-independent language-processing systems for French and Spanish were quickly developed by manually adapting an existing English-language system, the SRI Core Language Engine. We explain the adaptation process in detail, and argue that it provides a fairly general recipe for converting a grammar-based system for English into a corresponding one for a Romance lan guage.

Reference-contexts: The basic functionality offered by the CLE is two-way translation between surface form and a representation in terms of a logic-based formalism called QLF <ref> (Alshawi and Crouch 1992) </ref>. The modules comprising a version of the CLE for a given language can be divided into three groups, which we refer to as "code", "rules" and "pref-erences".
