Abstract: The ATM standard specifies two types of connections Virtual Paths (VPs) and Virtual Channels (VCs). A VP consists of an aggregated grouping of VCs. A VC consists of a concatenation of VPs. The VP concept was motivated by the desire to reduce the setup and switching costs of VCs, which are established on demand (or per call), by using existing VPs. In an ATM network, VC establishment is based on the layout of existing VPs. Thus it is important that VPs are constructed such that they can support the efficient setup of connection requests (VCs) among all network user pairs. Ideally, the most desirable VP-layout is a VP between each source-destination pair. However this is not feasible due to the limit in the number of incoming VPs each switch can support, and the high management overhead associated with supporting a large number of VPs. Other constraints on the VP-layout problem include the physical topology of the network (which include the physical link capacities), and the delay bounds between pairs of end user nodes (which is a traffic class specific constraint). This paper examines the efficient layout of VPs in an ATM network. The ATM network consists of ATM switches and their attached network end users, which may be gateways, routers, and hosts. The physical topology, the offered traffic, and call setup matrices of the network end users are assummed to be given. The problem is formulated as a flow-based optimization problem. A heuristic approach is presented which (i) establishes VPs according to physical network-specific and application-specific constraints and a cost function, (ii) provides multipaths between each source-destination user pair to minimize the call blocking probability and to increase network resilience, and (iii) uses a novel VP combining process which is guaranteed to always satisfy the switching constraints. Simulation results are presented for the proposed VP planning policy. Guidelines for the design of robust VP layouts and the efficient establishment of VCs are also presented.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) [3, 5, 8] is the switching and multiplexing method adopted by the CCITT for implementing B-ISDNs (Broadband Integrated Services Digital Networks). B-ISDNs, using ATM as its transport mechanism, will serve as the transport network for a wide spectrum of traffic types <ref> [1] </ref>. ATM is expected to efficiently support these multiple transport types while maintaining their corresponding performance requirements. ATM provides connection-oriented service in a packet-switched environment via virtual circuits. Virtual circuits must provide performance which is consistent with the various types of traffic they are transporting regardless of varying network loads.

Reference-contexts: Bandwidth may be allocated per VP or per VC. In cases of short bandwidth update intervals, <ref> [2] </ref> showed that bandwidth allocation per VP is more efficient than bandwidth allocation per VC. This is primarily because bandwidth allocation per VP reduces the VC control complexity. When a VP is initially established, bandwidth allocation per VP allocates bandwidth to all the links in the VP. <p> The segregation of traffic classes was mentioned in [3]. Here, we assume only a portion of VPIs are assigned to each traffic class at each switch. This can easily be extended to multiple traffic classes. 7. Bandwidth is allocated per VP. <ref> [2] </ref> has shown this to be more efficient than bandwidth allocation per VC. 3 Problem Formulation In this section, we formulate the VP planning problem as a flow-based optimization problem. We discuss connectivity, delay and switching constraints, which are peculiar to the VP planning problem.

Reference-contexts: The following observation follows from the description of the VP/VC switch architecture: Observation 1 The number of incoming VPs to switch S is equal to the number of allocated VPIs at S. 4 The motivation for using VPs is to minimize the overall data transmission cost <ref> [4] </ref>, which includes the transmission cost, switching cost, and call setup cost. Once VPs are layed out, VCs may establish a connection through a variable number of VPs. <p> In <ref> [4] </ref>, three kinds of policies, denoted by policy VP, policy VC, and policy VP/VC, were proposed. A cost model was developed, which was used as the basis for comparison between policies. <p> Basic VP-layout: VPs are established only for node pairs which are directly connected via a physical link. This is the same as the VC policy in <ref> [4] </ref>. It is the simplest scheme but inefficient in terms of switching cost and VC setup cost. 2. VP-layout: VPs are established for user-to-user, user-to-switch, switch-to-user and switch to-switch. This is referred to as a mixed VP/VC policy [4]. This is the most general way of implementing the VP/VC policy. <p> This is the same as the VC policy in <ref> [4] </ref>. It is the simplest scheme but inefficient in terms of switching cost and VC setup cost. 2. VP-layout: VPs are established for user-to-user, user-to-switch, switch-to-user and switch to-switch. This is referred to as a mixed VP/VC policy [4]. This is the most general way of implementing the VP/VC policy. For this scheme, the basic VP-layout is assumed to exist as permanent VPs. 13 Note that the above formulation captured only the flow and logical connectivity constraints of the problem.

Reference-contexts: This constraint is necessary because it is not possible to divide a traffic flow, t ij , such that t ij will flow on more than one path. 12 This problem formulation is a mixed 0-1 integer linear programming problem, which is NP- Complete <ref> [6] </ref>. The next part of the problem is to find a minimal cost or `optimal' VP-layout.

Reference-contexts: An alternate routing plan is generated by following the hierarchical network approach. The maximum number of VPs outgoing from a VP terminating node is given as an input parameter. 3. VPs are dimensioned (allocated with bandwidth) according to Pratt's method <ref> [9] </ref>. Their approach performed the VP planning process and physical link dimensioning simultaneously. This implies that their VP planning approach was intended for long term purposes.
