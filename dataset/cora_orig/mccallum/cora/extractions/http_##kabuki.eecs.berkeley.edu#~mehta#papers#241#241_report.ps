Abstract: We evaluated the performance of three CMOS current-mode, multivalued adder circuits in terms of area (reduced interconnect), speed, and power consumption and compared them to their binary, voltage-mode counterparts. We present the simulation results of these circuits, and one new circuit which has fewer transistors than any voltage-mode full adder. Our results, however, show that while current-mode, multi-valued circuits can be very compact, they are slower and consume an order of magnitude more power than conventional binary, voltage-mode implementations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Interconnect in VLSI circuits has become a substantial hurdle for increasing circuit speed and density due to RC delays and area-expensive routing. Interconnect can account for over half the area in a modern VLSI chip <ref> [1] </ref>. Multiple-valued logic (MVL) can potentially reduce the amount of interconnect and the number of active devices on a given chip. Intuitively, more information per wire should translate into fewer wires needed. Similarly, by extending MVL off-chip, we can reduce chip pinout.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, by extending MVL off-chip, we can reduce chip pinout. These reductions can improve performance in terms of speed, area, power (reduced amount of switched capacitance). These advantages have been confirmed for various processors, multipliers and other high-speed, compact arithmetic circuits <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. Current-mode techniques are particularly well-suited for implementing MVL. Current-mode logic (CML) has several advantages over voltage-mode MVL. Implementing voltage-mode MVL requires partitioning the total voltage range, zero to V dd into many discrete levels.

This adder is shown in figure 5, where TD (n; m) compares the input current I in to n, and if I in &gt; n then current m flows at the output. The triangles represent current mirrors.

Like the SDFA, it uses a redundant number representation to perform addition without carry propagation. The positive digit adder (PDA) uses values f0; 1; 2g which are represented with uni-directional currents only. This simpler representation does not require the somewhat cumbersome BDCI circuit.

Reference-contexts: We have included the simulated results of a low power, static CMOS full adder for comparison <ref> [5] </ref>. 6.1 Propagation delay Table 4 shows a comparison of the propagation delays. The SDFA is twice as slow as the PDA because the inverted quantizer in the SDFA approximately doubles the overall delay.
