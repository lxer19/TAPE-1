Abstract: The Robocup 97 competition provides an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the techniques and methods of artificial intelligence, autonomous agents and computer vision. On a soccer field the core capabilities a player must have are to navigate the field, track the ball and other agents, recognize the difference between agents, collaborate with other agents, and hit the ball in the correct direction. USC's Dreamteam of robots can be described as a group of mobile autonomous agents collaborating in a rapidly changing environment. The key characteristic of this team is that each soccer robot is an autonomous agent, self-contained with all of its essential capabilities onboard. Our robots share the same general architecture and basic hardware, but they have integrated abilities to play different roles (goal keeper, defender or forward) and utilize different strategies in their behavior . Our philosophy in building these robots is to use the least possible sophistication to make them as robust as possible. In the 1997 RoboCup competition, the Dreamteam played well and won the world championship in the middle sized robot league.

Reference-contexts: General Architecture For this project we define an autonomous agent as an active physical entity intelligently maneuvering and performing in realistic and challenging surroundings <ref> [4] </ref>. The critical design feature of our autonomous soccer agents is that each agent has all of the its essential capabilities onboard, so that every robot is self-contained. <p> To deal with much of the uncertainty associated with the system, closed-loop control in software is used whenever possible. 5. Related Work The current research follows the original work from a prediction-based architecture called LIVE [5] for integrating learning, planning and action in autonomous systems <ref> [4] </ref>, and a behavior-based robot control system [1,2]. Compared to similar architectures in recent agent literature (for example [7]), our approach uses the closed loop control theory in many aspects of robot building, and uses the internal model to help detect and recover from errors.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The Robocup task is for a team of multiple fast-moving robots to cooperatively play soccer in a dynamic environment <ref> [6] </ref>. Since teamwork and individual skills are fundamental factors in the performance of a soccer team, Robocup is an excellent testbed for autonomous agents. <p> Moreover, our robot agent can also be configured quickly into different soccer playing roles and that has greatly increased the flexibility of the entire robot team. Our philosophy on multi-agent collaboration <ref> [6] </ref> is that if each agent has a sufficient understanding of other agents' action, then collaboration can be accomplished without any Situation Action - Ball =&lt;near, center&gt;, Goal1=&lt;.,~?&gt; | Kick Ball =&lt;?, _&gt;,Goal1=&lt;.,~?&gt; | Homing Ball =&lt;?, _&gt;,Goal1=&lt;_,left&gt; | Turn-right Ball =&lt;?, _&gt;,Goal1=&lt;_,right&gt; | Turn-left Ball =&lt;?, _&gt;,Wall =&lt;near,?&gt; | Turn-left

Reference-contexts: Each soccer agent receives visual input from an onboard camera. Due to its simplicity, robustness, and software availability, we have chosen Connectix Color PC QuickCam <ref> [8] </ref> as the onboard visual input hardware. This is a CCD-based camera that outputs 658x496 RGB pixels through the parallel port of the agents computer. The camera also contains a micro-controller and other electronics to control operation of the camera and pixel data transmission.

Reference-contexts: To find a valid interpretation in our large frame database we can employed any decision tree algorithm to find the needed association rules between the frame color patterns and the class of objects. In this approach we applied C4.5 <ref> [9] </ref> as the main induction method. C4.5 package generates decision trees, which provides a classification for every object within the database. The package allows the decision tree to be simplified, using a pruning technique which reduces the size of the tree according to a user-defined confidence level.
