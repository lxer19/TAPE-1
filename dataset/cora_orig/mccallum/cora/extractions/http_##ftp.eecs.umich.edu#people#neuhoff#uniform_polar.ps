Abstract: Using a recent result on the support of uniform scalar quantization, we optimize uniform polar quantization by choosing the asymptotically optimal support of the magnitude quantizer and deriving the optimal rate allocation between the magnitude and phase quantizers. In uniform polar quantization (UPQ), X = (X 1 ; X 2 ) is quantized in terms of its magnitude M and phase fi, using uniform scalar quantizers with N M and N fi levels and step sizes M and fi . UPQ was optimized numerically in [2] and [4] and analytically in [5]. However, the analysis in [5] assumed a fixed support, N M M , of the magnitude quantizer, when in fact for true optimality the support needs to increase with rate. In this paper, we optimize UPQ asymptotically by using a recent result on the support of uniform scalar quantization [3] to choose the optimal support of the magnitude quantizer. We then find the optimal rate allocation between magnitude and phase and the resulting mean-squared error. resulting MSE D fl M = (oe 2 =3) ln N M =N 2 M . These asymptotic results can be used to derive the following lemma, which shows M and fi = 2=N fi yields the MSE of the resulting UPQ as a function of the magnitude rate R M that MSE is approximately
