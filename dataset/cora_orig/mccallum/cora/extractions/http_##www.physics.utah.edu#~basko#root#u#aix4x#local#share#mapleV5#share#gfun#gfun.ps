Reference-contexts: Many so-called intelligence tests include such an exercise. Of course, from the mathematical point of view no unique solution exists to such a question, unless extra constraints are added. For instance, Bergeron and Plouffe <ref> [1] </ref> have studied the problem of trying to get a rational generating function, or a function whose logarithmic derivative is rational, and several variations of these.

Reference-contexts: However, by means of Borel transform and then its inverse transform under integral form, one can get correct numerical values from these divergent series (the litterature on this subject is abundant, more precise and general statements can be found in <ref> [2, 3, 14, 15, 18] </ref>). Of particular interest are the singularities of the Borel transform which are intimately related to the Stokes phenomenon. This corresponds to taking different paths of integration in (7) so as to avoid singularities.

Reference-contexts: When viewed as an e.g.f, the function 1=(1z) corresponds to fn!g. Other elementary generating functions include 1=(1 z) 2 for f1; 2; 3; : : :g, or 1=(1 z z 2 ) for the Fibonacci sequence. Nice examples can be found in many references, see for instance <ref> [7] </ref>. Many properties of a sequence are reflected by analytical properties of its generating function. In particular, asymptotic properties of a sequence are usually more directly computable from its generating function. <p> Nothing is output otherwise. This heuristically insures that the generating function which is found is not an accident. Example: This is the Fibonacci sequence: &gt; listtoratpoly ([1,1,2,3,5,8,13],z); 1 2 Example: The "probleme des rencontres" (see <ref> [7, pp. 180-183] </ref>) consists in studying the number of permutations of size n with no fix points. <p> Example: This is the Fibonacci sequence: &gt; listtoratpoly ([1,1,2,3,5,8,13],z); 1 2 Example: The "probleme des rencontres" (see [7, pp. 180-183]) consists in studying the number of permutations of size n with no fix points. From the table <ref> [7, p. 182] </ref>, we get the 13 first values, and our program does the rest: &gt; listtoratpoly ([1,0,1,2,9,44,265,1854,14833,133496,1334961,14684570,176214841], &gt; t,[ogf,egf,lgdogf,lgdegf]); t [- -------, lgdegf] - 1 + t &gt; expand (exp (int (op (1,"),t=0..z))); 1 exp (z) (1 - z) This is precisely the generating function in [7, p. 182, Theorem <p> From the table [7, p. 182], we get the 13 first values, and our program does the rest: &gt; listtoratpoly ([1,0,1,2,9,44,265,1854,14833,133496,1334961,14684570,176214841], &gt; t,[ogf,egf,lgdogf,lgdegf]); t [- -------, lgdegf] - 1 + t &gt; expand (exp (int (op (1,"),t=0..z))); 1 exp (z) (1 - z) This is precisely the generating function in <ref> [7, p. 182, Theorem B] </ref>. <p> The problem of enumerating clouds <ref> [7, pp. 273-277] </ref> falls into the same class, with a less trivial rational function. listtodiffeq and seriestodiffeq The rational generating functions treated by the procedures above can be viewed as solutions of linear differential equations of order 0 with polynomial coefficients (the numerator and denominator). <p> More generally, when faced with a sequence, it is very important to check whether it may be holonomic, because this allows for a very fast computation of the elements of the sequence. Another nice example is the rencontres problem <ref> [7, p. 180-183] </ref> already mentioned. ratpolytocoeff Given a rational function, this procedure computes an explicit value of the nth Taylor coefficient. The algorithm consists in computing a partial fraction decomposition and then translating it term by term.

Reference-contexts: It is thus very important to have a tool that will look for the minimal polynomial directly. Example: Convex polyominoes of perimeter 2n. It has been shown by M. Delest and X. Vi-ennot <ref> [8] </ref> that the number of such polyominoes has an algebraic generating function of degree 2 (with large degree coefficients).

Reference-contexts: This yields the desired equation. Note: if P is not irreducible, a recursive splitting can be used as is now usual in computer algebra <ref> [9] </ref>, and algfuntodiffeq applied to each factor. After making the resulting differential equations homogeneous, the procedure diffeq+diffeq (see below) gives a holonomic equation for the roots of P (z; y (z)) = 0. Example: Motzkin numbers. These numbers count the number of unary-binary trees of size n.

Reference-contexts: A future version of this program will completely avoid unnecessary factorizations and thus work over the mimimal algebraic extension <ref> [10] </ref>. 3 Installation and customization As usual in Maple, the package gfun comes in two files: gfun and gfun.test.

Reference-contexts: Another nice feature of these functions is that there is an obvious correspondence (morphism) between operations performed on the sequences and operations performed on the generating functions. An elementary introduction to this can be found in <ref> [11, 21] </ref>. The package gfun has been designed as an help for the manipulation and discovery of generating functions. Given the first terms of the sequence, the package contains functions that will help conjecture what the generating function is. In some cases, this answer will be "explicit".

Reference-contexts: In most cases, the generating function which is found by gfun is the right one. For instance, among the approximately 4500 sequences contained in the next edition of Sloane's book <ref> [16] </ref>, about 22% of the generating functions can be found automatically without error.
