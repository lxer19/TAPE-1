Abstract: A patient visits the doctor; the doctor reviews the patient's history, asks questions, makes basic measurements (blood pressure, ...), and prescribes tests or treatment. The prescribed course of action is based on an assessment of patient risk|patients at higher risk are given more and faster attention. It is also sequential|it is too expensive to immediately order all tests which might later be of value. This paper presents two methods that together improve the accuracy of backprop nets on a pneumonia risk assessment problem by 10-50%. Rankprop improves on backpropagation with sum of squares error in ranking patients by risk. Multitask learning takes advantage of future lab tests available in the training set, but not available in practice when predictions must be made. Both methods are broadly applicable.

Reference-contexts: The extra lab values are used as extra backprop outputs as shown in Figure 1. The extra outputs bias the shared hidden layer towards representations that better capture important features of the domain. See [2][3][9] for details about MTL and <ref> [1] </ref> for other ways of using extra outputs to bias learning. The MTL net has 64 hidden units. Table 3 shows the mean performance of ten runs of MTL with rankprop.

Reference-contexts: They can't be used as inputs for learning to drive because they will not be available until too late when driving. As MTL outputs, though, they provide information that improves learning without requiring they be available at run time <ref> [2] </ref>. 8 Summary This paper presents two methods that can improve generalization on a broad class of problems. This class includes identifying low risk pneumonia patients. The first method, rankprop, tries to learn simple models that support ranking future cases while simultaneously learning to rank the training set.

Reference-contexts: In fact, it is sufficient to learn to rank patients by POD so lower risk patients can be discriminated from higher risk patients. The patients at least risk may then be considered for outpatient care. The performance criterion used by others working with the Medis database <ref> [4] </ref> is the accuracy with which one can select a prespecified fraction of the patient population that do not die. For example, given a population of 10,000 patients, find the 20% of this population at least risk. <p> This improvement is not easy to achieve|experiments with other learning methods such as Bayes Nets, Hierarchical Mixtures of Experts, and K-Nearest Neighbor (run not by us, but by experts in their use) indicate SSE on 0/1 targets is an excellent performer on this domain <ref> [4] </ref>.

We are given data from a target function f (x).

Reference-contexts: But it can also be applied wherever the goal is to order data. For example, in information filtering it is usually important to present more useful information to the user first, not to predict how important each is <ref> [5] </ref>. MTL is a general method for using related tasks. Here the extra MTL tasks are future measurements. Future measurements are available in many o*ine learning problems where there is opportunity to collect the measurements for the training set.

Reference-contexts: In addition to medical decision making, this class includes problems as diverse as investment analysis in financial markets and autonomous vehicle navigation. 1.2 The Pneumonia Database The Medis Pneumonia Database <ref> [6] </ref> contains 14,199 pneumonia cases collected from 78 hospitals in 1989. Each patient in the database was diagnosed with pneumonia and hospitalized. 65 measurements are available for most patients.

Reference-contexts: INPUTS INPUT LAYER OUTPUT LAYER SHARED HIDDEN LAYER RANKPROP OUTPUT FUTURE LABS . . . alone. Although MTL lowers error at each FOP, only the differences at FOP = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 are statistically significant with ten trials. Feature nets <ref> [7] </ref>, a competing approach that trains nets to predict the missing future labs and uses the predictions as extra net inputs does not yield benefits comparable to MTL on this problem.

Reference-contexts: One application is domains where quantitative measurements are not available, but relative ones are <ref> [8] </ref>. For example, a game player might not be able to evaluate moves quantitatively , but might excel at relative move evaluation [10]. Another application is where the goal is to learn to order data drawn from a probability distribution, as in medical risk prediction.
