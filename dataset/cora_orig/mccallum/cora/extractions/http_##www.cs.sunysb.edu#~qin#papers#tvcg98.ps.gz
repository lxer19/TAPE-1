Reference-contexts: The largest eigenvalue of such a matrix is 1 and it can be shown that the corresponding infinite series is convergent following a similar approach as in <ref> [7] </ref>. The rest of the derivation leading to an expression for s is relatively straight forward. <p> The ff ii (u; v) and fi ij (u; v)s are elasticity functions controlling local tension and rigidity in the two parametric coordinate directions. Note that for certain parameterizations, the thin-plate energy expression may diverge at extraordinary points on the limit surface for Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme as shown in <ref> [7] </ref>. Several methods have been suggested in [7] to overcome the problem of the divergent series. However, we circumvent the problem by setting the corresponding rigidity coefficients to be zero at these points. Therefore, the thin-plate energy at extraordinary points is zero. <p> Note that for certain parameterizations, the thin-plate energy expression may diverge at extraordinary points on the limit surface for Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme as shown in <ref> [7] </ref>. Several methods have been suggested in [7] to overcome the problem of the divergent series. However, we circumvent the problem by setting the corresponding rigidity coefficients to be zero at these points. Therefore, the thin-plate energy at extraordinary points is zero. <p> It may be noted that the stiffness energy due to plate terms diverges at the extraordinary points on the limit surface. We solve the problem using a slightly different approach than the one used in <ref> [7] </ref>. When the area of the bicubic patch obtained via local subdivision of the initial mesh around an extraordinary vertex becomes smaller than the display resolution, the contribution from such a bicubic patch is ignored in computing the physical matrices of the corresponding special element.

Reference-contexts: The physics of the dynamic subdivision surface model is based on the work-energy version of Lagrangian dynamics <ref> [46] </ref> and is formulated in an analogous way to the dynamic framework presented in [35]. In an abstract physical system, let p i (t) be a set of generalized coordinates which are functions of time and are assembled into the vector p. <p> Therefore, the thin-plate energy at extraordinary points is zero. The effect is negligible to the overall thin-plate energy as very few extraordinary points are present in the smooth limit surface. The generalized force vector f p can be obtained through the principle of virtual work <ref> [46] </ref> done by the applied force distribution f (u; v; t) and can be expressed as f p = J T f (u; v; t)dudv (21) July 13, 1998 DRAFT 19 E.1 Multilevel Dynamics Our dynamic Catmull-Clark surface model can be subdivided globally to increase the number of vertices (control points)

Reference-contexts: Then M = J T Jdudv (18) is an N fi N mass matrix. Similarly the expression for damping matrix is D = flJ T Jdudv (19) where fl (u; v) is the damping density. A thin-plate-under-tension energy model <ref> [47] </ref> is used to compute the elastic potential energy of the dynamic subdivision surface.

Reference-contexts: An analytical solution of the governing differential equation can not be derived in general. However, an efficient numerical implementation can be obtained using the finite element method <ref> [48] </ref>. The limit surface of the dynamic Catmull-Clark subdivision model is a collection of bicubic patch elements.

Reference-contexts: To recover shapes from 3D image data, we synthesize image-based forces. A 3D edge detection is performed on a Gaussian smoothed volume data set using the 3D Monga-Deriche (MD) operator <ref> [49] </ref> to produce a 3D potential field P (x; y; z), which we use as an external potential for the model. The force distribution is then computed as f (x; y; z) = k k 5P (x; y; z) k where k controls the strength of the force.
