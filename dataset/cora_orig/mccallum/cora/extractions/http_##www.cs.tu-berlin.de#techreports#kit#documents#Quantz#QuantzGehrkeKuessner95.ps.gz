Abstract: In this paper we present the approach to domain modeling realized in the VERBMOBIL project, a project concerned with face-to-face dialogue interpreting funded by the German Ministry of Research and Technology. We argue that domain modeling is task dependent and present the specific design criteria relevant in the context of Machine Translation (MT). We begin by sketching the relationship between domain modeling and lexical semantics and argue that in the context of MT transfer-oriented conceptual hierarchies can support both disambiguation and transfer. We show how a constrastive analysis of source and target language forms the basis for such a transfer-oriented conceptual hierarchy. Finally, we describe how conceptual information is used to preferentially order the out put of the speech parser.

It should also be noted that the proper analysis of type coercion effects may depend on material analysed after the sortal mismatch.

Reference-contexts: To illustrate the problem, consider some of the examples discussed in the literature. Bosch discusses the truth conditions of (1) There will be coffee in the lounge at 10.30. in <ref> [4] </ref>. He claims that this sentence would be true if 1. there were a coffee break at 10.30; 2. there were a bag of coffee beans on one of the tables in the lounge; 3. there were coffee powder spilled on the carpet; 3 4. etc. <p> This example illustrates several important points. For one thing, truth conditions, if understood as in Bosch's example, do not reflect our ability of understanding completely. Our understanding of utterances in ordinary circumstances is almost always more specific than the truth conditions of the sentence uttered <ref> [4, p. 251] </ref>. Second, instead of assigning a single conceptual content to each expression, it seems more reasonable to say that an expression as a system-expression is ambiguous since it can express several different conceptual contents. <p> Bill opened a restaurant. 3 One consequence of this approach is that truth conditions are underdetermined by sentences. Truth conditions are only determined given a particular choice of the conceptual contents of the expressions occurring in the sentences (see, for example, [17, p. 12ff] or <ref> [4, p. 251] </ref>). 4 Bosch discusses the same problem and lists the 29 senses of `open' in Collins Cobuild En glish Language Dictionary [5]. 4 Searle uses these examples to show that understanding requires a preintentional Background and that the literal meaning of a sentence is thus not a context-free notion,

Reference-contexts: Appropriateness is here usually understood as correctly capturing the truth conditions of an expression. Given the dominance of truth-conditional semantics in the last decades, it is not suprising that many approaches to lexical meaning rely on the truth-condition-testing method. Consider, for example, the definition of cognitive synonymy in <ref> [6, p. 88] </ref>: X is a cognitive synonym of Y, if (i) X and Y are syntactically iden tical, and (ii) any grammatical declarative sentence S containing X has equivalent truth-conditions to another sentence S', which is identical to S except that X is replaced by Y.

Reference-contexts: Though we think that this is a useful test criterion for synonymy it is not a real definition since it reduces synonymy of lexemes to equivalence of truth conditions, i.e. to analyticity (see <ref> [25, p. 28ff] </ref>). In fact recourse to truth conditions does not help us much in modeling conceptual contents, because if we are uncertain about the exact meaning of an expression we will not be able to specify the exact truth conditions of a sentence containing it.

Reference-contexts: conceptual hierarchy, e.g. `coffee drink' below `drink', `coffee break' below `event', etc. 3 But we immediately face another problemhow do we decide how many conceptual contents we have to assign to an expression? Again, consider an example taken from the literature, namely the meaning of the lexeme `open' discussed in <ref> [26, p. 145] </ref>: 4 (2) a. Tom opened the door. b. Sally opened her eyes. c. The carpenters opened the wall. d. Sam opened his book on page 37. e. The surgeon opened the wound. <p> Anyone who denied this would soon be forced to hold the view that the word open is indefinitely or perhaps even infinitely ambiguous since we can continue the example; and indef inite ambiguity seems an absurd result. <ref> [26, p. 146] </ref> He gives additional examples in which one might argue that the lexeme `open' has a different meaning: (3) a. The chairman opened the meeting. b. The artillery opened fire. c. <p> senses of `open' in Collins Cobuild En glish Language Dictionary [5]. 4 Searle uses these examples to show that understanding requires a preintentional Background and that the literal meaning of a sentence is thus not a context-free notion, but is relative to a set of preintentional Background assumptions and practices <ref> [26, p. 145f] </ref>. For our argumentation it is important to note that these examples show how linguistic meaning and encyclopedic information are intertwined. Only given our knowledge about the typical events described in the sentences do we understand the word `open'.
