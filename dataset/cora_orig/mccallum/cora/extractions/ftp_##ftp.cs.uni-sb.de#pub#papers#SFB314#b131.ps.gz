Reference-contexts: In particular, relatively recent studies have shown that people can actually perform well on basically the same experimental tasks under certain circumstancesfor instance when the tasks are reformulated in terms of frequencies as opposed to subjective probabilities <ref> (see, e.g., the recent review by Ayton & Pascoe, 1995) </ref>. In sum, a judgment of the human-likeness of the inferences supported by a particular uncertainty management framework should take into account the nature and context of the particular inferences being made. 5.6.

Reference-contexts: In Figure 7B, S has just determined that U knows the MUNDANE concept RWHO. This evidence is combined with the previous evidence through an application of Dempster's rule of combination <ref> (see, e.g., Bauer, 1995, section 5) </ref>. This rule plays a role analogous to that of Bayes' rule within BNs.

Reference-contexts: Are the problems within A small? Even computationally complex methods can be used if the problems are small enough. And in user modeling systems, there may be specific places where a differentiated and reliable treatment of uncertainty is desirable even if most of the system uses other inference techniques <ref> (cf., e.g., the system of Carberry, 1990, discussed in Section 3.2) </ref>. 2.

Reference-contexts: These previous analyses showed that this problem lends itself quite well to treatment with relatively traditional approachesand therefore does not satisfy a criterion that is often applied to motivate the use of FL. But a basically fuzzy treatment was worked out in the mid-1980's by Chin <ref> (see, e.g., Chin, 1989) </ref> for KNOME, the user modeling component of the UNIX CONSULTANT.

Reference-contexts: One way of conceptualizing this problem is to view U as defining a fuzzy concept SUITABLE SCREEN SIZE which is clearly applicable at 19 inches and less applicable at some other values. Fuzzy logic provides a repertoire of membership functions for capturing such concepts <ref> (see, e.g., Cox, 1994, chap. 3) </ref>. The problem of determining the overall suitability of a product X for U can then be viewed as the problem of interpreting a fuzzy rule like the following one: . <p> For example, it must be determined what the conjunction AND means in this contextin particular, the extent to which a single unsuitable attribute should disqualify a product. There is no universally valid answer, but fuzzy logic provides a library of functions for the interpretation of operators like this one <ref> (see, e.g., Cox, 1994, chap. 4) </ref>. In sum, the verbal formulations that people tend to prefer to use to express quantitative information in general have meanings which are vague and context-dependent (see Wallsten et al., 1993; Wallsten & Budescu, 1995).

Reference-contexts: In BNs that are singly connected (i.e., that have at most one undirected path between any two nodes), propagation time is linear or better in the size of the network <ref> (see, e.g., Delcher et al., 1995) </ref>. It also helps if a typical node has a small number of parents and if a typical variable has a small number of possible values (Wellman & Liu, 1995).

Reference-contexts: Tokuda and Fukuda adopt a computationally simpler procedure, following an approach applied in some previous applications of DST <ref> (e.g., by Gordon & Shortliffe, 1984) </ref>. They divide the 36 bugs into 3 basic classes such that the bugs within each class produce incorrect answers on a particular type of problem (e.g., problems that require borrowing across more than one column).

Reference-contexts: to a report on his research group's efforts to find tolerably fast ways of evaluating their especially fine-grained BNs. it.tex; 21/12/1995; 0:28; no v.; p.42 42 ANTHONY JAMESON probabilities in a BN appears to work well only when the prior probability of the condition to be diagnosed is very small <ref> (Henrion et al., 1994) </ref>. And a Monte Carlo technique for DST proposed by Kreinovich et al. (1994) is inapplicable if Dempster's rule of combination is used; the designer must be willing to accept an alternative rule for integrating pieces of evidence.

Reference-contexts: Finally, PRACMA illustrates a further possible approach to the problem of how to generate BNs dynamically (cf. Sections 2.3, 2.4, 2.7, 2.9 and 2.10): To predict what inferences U might make on the basis of a given statement by S, the system first uses a modal-logic-based representation system <ref> (Hustadt & Nonnengart, 1993) </ref> to generate possible inferences that U might conceivably make. S then uses the proof trees produced by the modal-logic-based system to construct BNs which predict whether this particular U actually has enough knowledge to make these inferences (Jameson, 1995).

Reference-contexts: A fair amount of research has been devoted to the development of techniques for explaining the reasoning of systems that are based on BNs and DST (see, e.g., Henrion & Druzdzel, 1991, and Xu & Smets, 1995, respectively). Comparable research on other normatively oriented reasoning techniques <ref> (see, e.g., Klein & Shortliffe, 1994) </ref> is also relevant on a more general level. The results suggest that, with ingenuity and careful attention to users' reasoning processes, researchers and designers can find ways to bridge the gap between formally rigorous methods and users' natural ways of thinking. 5.7.

Reference-contexts: of concepts and techniques developed within the tradition of FL have been used for the management of uncertainty, for example in expert systems; these include possibility theory (see, e.g., Zadeh, 1981) and the adaptation of probability theory and DST to the use of imprecisely specified probabilities and degrees of belief <ref> (e.g., by Lamata & Moral, 1994) </ref>. With regard to uncertainty management in user modeling, the appeal of FL appears to be based mainly on two quite different considerations: 1. People often reason in terms of vague concepts when dealing with situations in which they experience uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: If such a decision is called into question and has to be explained, it may be useful to be able to argue that the system employs the most reliable techniques currently available, even if these techniques are less intuitively natural than the alternatives <ref> (cf.

Reference-contexts: The problem becomes worse if there are more alternative goals, or if each one has a more complex set of associated actions and/or subgoals <ref> (cf., e.g., the example given by Mislevy, 1994, pp. 467468) </ref>. The simpler solution used by Huber et al. is to add an inhibitory link from GOAL 1 to GOAL 2 (represented by the dashed arrow in Figure 6A).

Reference-contexts: As is usual with decisions about declarative vs. procedural solutions, there are arguments for and against each of these options. But POLA's domain does appear to be one in which a partly procedural approach deserves serious consideration. 2.5.

One salient characteristic of the system is its use of dimensional variables at three different levels of specificity, as depicted in the three upper levels of the partial network shown in Figure 4A.

Reference-contexts: More generally, designers of user modeling systems may take a hint from the fact that social psychologists <ref> (e.g., Nisbett & Ross, 1980, chap. 4) </ref> have identified biased data sampling as a major source of error in everyday social perception. 4 See, for example, Falmagne et al.

Reference-contexts: Systems That Have Used Bayesian Networks The most straightforward examples of Bayesian networks are those that involve a physical system that consists of several components some of which influence others causally. For example, a burglar alarm <ref> (see, e.g., Pearl, 1988, chap. 2) </ref> can be set off by at least two possible causes: a burglary or an earthquake. <p> The belief for KNOWLEDGE BY U OF MORE shows that S expects U to know MORE, even though S has no prior experience with U , simply because MORE is apparently so easy. This type of inference from causes to effects can be called predictive inference <ref> (cf. Pearl, 1988, p. 6) </ref>. Diagnostic inference, on the other hand, moves from observed effects to possible causes. For example, the second (gray) histogram for each node shows S's beliefs after S has learned that U does in fact know MORE. <p> In other words, for many systems precise and accurate results do not represent the chief benefit of employing numerical uncertainty management techniques. There are several advantages to the use of well-understood numerical techniques which can be exploited even if the system's quantitative knowledge base leaves much room for improvement <ref> (cf. Pearl, 1988, pp. 2021) </ref>: 1. <p> The user should also be able to recognize certain typical patterns of reasoning, such as the pattern of explaining away: the idea that to the extent to which an effect has been explained adequately by one cause, it no longer constitutes evidence for the operation of another possible cause <ref> (cf. Pearl, 1988, p. 7) </ref>. A fair amount of research has been devoted to the development of techniques for explaining the reasoning of systems that are based on BNs and DST (see, e.g., Henrion & Druzdzel, 1991, and Xu & Smets, 1995, respectively).

Reference-contexts: THE SALES ASSISTANT: MAXIMAL USE OF MINIMAL USER INPUT If system designers and knowledge engineers are often more comfortable with fuzzy concepts than with precise numbers, the same is even more true of ordinary system users. This consideration is taken into account in the SALES ASSISTANT <ref> (Popp & L odel, 1995, in this issue) </ref>. Part of this system is responsible for predicting how a user will evaluate particular products. Consider, for example, the problem of asking U how important the attribute Screen size is in her evaluation of a personal computer.

Reference-contexts: In this way, S can form hypotheses about how the chosen plan depends on the situation. For the formation of these hypotheses, the system employs machine learning techniques. For example, it uses ID3 <ref> (Quinlan, 1983) </ref> to construct a decision tree which relates features of situations to typical behaviors of the current user in those situations. So now the system no longer has to use simple rules such as .

Reference-contexts: The development of FL was motivated largely by a desire to make the arbitrary specification of precise numbers unnecessary. In particular, it is sometimes noted that it is easier to elicit fuzzy rules than exact numbers from domain experts <ref> (see, e.g., Section 4.2 and Vadiee & Jamshidi, 1994, p. 37) </ref>. Still, FL-based systems do require the specification of numbers on other levels.

Even when it is possible to process numerous observations of a person, carefully chosen and interpreted with reference to an extensive empirical database, the task of dealing with the uncertainty associated with the evidence is challenging.

With DST, it is helpful if only a small number of possible subsets of each set of hypotheses has to be taken into account (cf. Sections 3.1, 3.3, and 3.4).
