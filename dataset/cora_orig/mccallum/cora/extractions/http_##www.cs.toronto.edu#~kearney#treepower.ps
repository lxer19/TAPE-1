Abstract: We present the first polynomial algorithm for recognizing tree powers. A graph G is a tree power if there is a tree T and a positive integer k such that T k ~ = G where x and y are adjacent in T k if and only if d T (x; y) k. We also show that a natural extension of tree power recognition is NP-complete, namely, given a graph G and a positive integer r, determine if there is a tree power within r edges of G.

Reference-contexts: We assume a simple elimination ordering of the vertices of G is obtained before the algorithm begins. Simple elimination orderings can be found in O (n 3 ) time <ref> [AF, HKS] </ref>. If G [V i ] is complete but V i 6 core (G) then leaves of T [V i ] are determined using the Inductive Leaf Lemma. Using appropriate data structures, a leaf of T [V i ] can be found in O (n 2 ) time.

Reference-contexts: Despite the importance of recognition, substantial results in the area of graph powers and roots are scarce. Characterizations of graph squares [Muk], square roots of directed graphs [Gel] and graph powers in general <ref> [EMR] </ref> have been given yet these characterizations have not yielded polynomial recognition algorithms. Motwani and Sudan have shown that unrestricted graph power recognition is NP-complete [MS]. Although this result testifies to the difficulty of graph power recognition, it does not shed light on restricted graph power recognition problems.

Reference-contexts: It turns out that G is strongly chordal if and only if G has a simple elimination order <ref> [Far] </ref>. The Extreme Leaf Lemma also guarantees the existence of a leaf v of T [V i ] which is simple in G [V i ]. We will capitalize on this fact in section 3.2 when we determine v's root.

Reference-contexts: Hamada has given an algorithm that finds all kth tree roots of an input graph with the restriction that it be known a priori that the input graph is a kth tree power <ref> [Ham] </ref>. This restriction is necessary since the algorithm does not produce the bijection between vertices of the input graph and vertices of a generated tree. As a result, verifying a solution reduces to an instance of graph isomorphism. Hence, Hamada's algorithm doesn't solve the recognition problem.

Reference-contexts: It is clear that CTP (3) is in N P . We reduce the problem FUT to CTP (3) to complete the proof of NP-completeness. FUT has been shown to be NP-complete by Krivanek and Moravek <ref> [KM] </ref>. Fitting Ultrametric Trees (FUT): Instance: Binary dissimilarity matrix M on S where jSj 4 and even, and a positive integer k. Problem: Is there a 2-ultrametric T on S such that E (T; M ) k? To facilitate this, we first establish some structural results. Lemma 7.

Reference-contexts: As a result, verifying a solution reduces to an instance of graph isomorphism. Hence, Hamada's algorithm doesn't solve the recognition problem. Although our interest in tree powers is largely theoretical, graph powers are associated with problems in distributed computing <ref> [Lin] </ref>. In particular, tree powers model the situation where a collection of processors are (minimally) connected by a tree network T . A communication step is the amount of time required for a processor to pass information to a neighbor.
