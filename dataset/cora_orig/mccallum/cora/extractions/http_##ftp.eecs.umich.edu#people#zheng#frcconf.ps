Reference-contexts: A natural modification to the ATM is thus to employ a different scheduling policy for the transmission of packets. This is the concept of real-time channel proposed by Ferrari and Verma <ref> [1] </ref>, where each packet is assigned a deadline over each link on its route and the transmission of packets over a link is scheduled according to their deadlines. <p> The concept of real-time channel cannot be efficiently implemented without solving these two problems. Ferrari and Verma <ref> [1] </ref> obtained a solution to the schedulability problem under the assumption that the summation of the maximum packet transmission times over all real-time channels passing through a link is not larger than the minimum packet interarrival times of these channels. <p> Since any set of channels which are schedulable under the priority scheduling policy are also schedulable under the deadline scheduling policy, this condition is a sufficient schedulability condition for the deadline-driven policy. It can be proved that under the assumption of <ref> [1] </ref>, the sufficient condition in [2] is equivalent to that in [1]. So, the former subsumes the latter; that is, [2] can deal with situations where the assumption of [1] fails to hold. <p> It can be proved that under the assumption of <ref> [1] </ref>, the sufficient condition in [2] is equivalent to that in [1]. So, the former subsumes the latter; that is, [2] can deal with situations where the assumption of [1] fails to hold. <p> It can be proved that under the assumption of <ref> [1] </ref>, the sufficient condition in [2] is equivalent to that in [1]. So, the former subsumes the latter; that is, [2] can deal with situations where the assumption of [1] fails to hold. However, using sufficient schedulabil-ity conditions for establishing real-time channels may still under-utilize the network's transmission capacity since violation of the sufficient conditions does not necessarily mean that the channels cannot be established. <p> Section 3 shows how single-failure-immune (SFI) real-time channels can be established. The paper concludes with Section 4. 2 Real-Time Channels A real-time channel is defined as a simplex virtual circuit between the source and destination nodes which guarantees the delivery of packets within a user-requested end-to-end delay bound <ref> [1] </ref>. The choice of virtual circuits over datagram services is based on their relative ease in controlling packet delivery times.

Reference-contexts: Using a proper deadline assignment policy, the network will first serve those packets of the channels that require tight delivery delays and/or high link bandwidths. This will solve the second problem of the STM. However, as pointed out in <ref> [2] </ref>, the main problem with the deadline scheduling policy is the difficulty in computing guarantees. <p> This assumption is quite restrictive in practice since it limits the traffic types to be serviced. Without using this assumption, Kandlur et al. <ref> [2] </ref> established a sufficient condition to check the schedula-bility of channels. They first derived the schedulability conditions from the priority scheduling policy. <p> Since any set of channels which are schedulable under the priority scheduling policy are also schedulable under the deadline scheduling policy, this condition is a sufficient schedulability condition for the deadline-driven policy. It can be proved that under the assumption of [1], the sufficient condition in <ref> [2] </ref> is equivalent to that in [1]. So, the former subsumes the latter; that is, [2] can deal with situations where the assumption of [1] fails to hold. <p> It can be proved that under the assumption of [1], the sufficient condition in <ref> [2] </ref> is equivalent to that in [1].

However, using sufficient schedulabil-ity conditions for establishing real-time channels may still under-utilize the network's transmission capacity since violation of the sufficient conditions does not necessarily mean that the channels cannot be established. <p> The proposed fault-tolerant real-time channel protocols are currently being implemented on an experimental distributed system called HARTS at the Real-time Computing Laboratory of the University of Michigan [5]. The second version of the HARTS operating system called HARTOS includes the real-time channel establishment procedure described in <ref> [2, 6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The switching delay at a node depends on the switch architecture and the switching technique used by the node. According to the discussion in <ref> [3] </ref>, the 1 C varies over links with different transmission rates and lengths.
