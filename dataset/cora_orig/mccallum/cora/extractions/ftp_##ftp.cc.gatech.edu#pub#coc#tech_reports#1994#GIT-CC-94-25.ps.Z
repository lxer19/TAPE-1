Abstract: Designing an interdomain multicast routing scheme that makes efficient use of network resources while delivering good performance to applications is a significant challenge. A variety of schemes have been proposed, but little has been done to compare the schemes systematically over a rich set scenarios. In this work we develop a framework to do systematic evaluation of multicast routing schemes, and apply it to two practical schemes: Distance Vector Multicast Routing Procotol and Core Based Trees. We conclude that Core Based Trees has the potential to make more efficient use of resources, with modest performance penalty. However, this requires mechanisms to choose good cores. We suggest a heuristic for evaluating the goodness of a core and moving towards a good core.

Reference-contexts: Connection-less (or datagram) schemes do not reserve resources; rather the network makes a best effort to deliver data. A variety of schemes have been proposed for connectionless multicast routing, including Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) [6], Link State Multicast Routing Protocol [5], and Core Based Trees (CBT) <ref> [1] </ref>.

Thus, routers not involved with a particular multicast group nevertheless incur overhead associated with maintaining the tree for the group. 2.2 CBT Core Based Trees (CBT) <ref> [1] </ref> is a recently proposed alternative to DVMRP. The main goals of CBT are scalability and independence of underlying unicast routing mechanism. The key idea behind the scheme is to designate a core router for each multicast group. <p> The latter two can be ameliorated somewhat by assigning multiple cores per group <ref> [1] </ref>. Our evaluation considers only single cores, however. 2.3 Summary DVMRP can be expected to be superior to CBT in terms of delay, since a shortest path tree rooted at each source is optimal with respect to that measure.

Reference-contexts: The advantages of DVMRP are its low delay characteristics (it performs optimally with respect to this metric, since each packet follows the shortest path from the source to each destination) and its relatively simple implementation. It is the scheme currently used for Internet multicasting over the MBONE <ref> [2] </ref>. However, DVMRP requires that each router store information for each (source, group) pair; this information determines whether a packet from a particular source is forwarded on a particular link. Moreover, in DVMRP, neighboring routers must periodically take explicit action in order to "turn off" forwarding.

Reference-contexts: Several issues must be addressed. First, what quantities are of practical interest? Multicast approaches can be compared along a number of dimensions, including complexity of implementation and administration, (e.g the amount of state information stored by each router), efficiency of resource usage <ref> [3, 10] </ref>, (e.g. the amount of bandwidth required to deliver a mul-ticast packet), performance delivered to the application, (e.g. the maximum delay from a source to a destination), robustness in case of node or link failure, and scalability. A second issue concerns the choice of realistic operational scenarios.

Reference-contexts: Sources send to the group by addressing (unicast) packets to the core address of the group. When such a packet encounters a CBT-capable router that is part of the shortest path tree for the group, the packet thereafter follows the tree to the members. Like DVMRP, CBT uses IGMP <ref> [4] </ref> to deal with hosts joining and leaving groups. Each CBT-capable router stores information only for multicast groups to which it needs to route packets (i.e., it is in the shortest path tree from the core to some group member).

Reference-contexts: Compared to DVMRP, CBT should also offer a reduction in the bandwidth required to transmit packets, because multiple shortest path trees do not necessarily perform well with respect to bandwidth consumption. (Optimizing bandwidth requires solving the NP-complete Steiner tree problem <ref> [8] </ref>.) In the remainder of the paper we attempt to quantify these differences in bandwidth and delay, and to characterize, in a general way, their sensitivity to a variety of parameters. 3 Evaluation Methodology 3.1 Network Model We model the network as an undirected graph in which nodes represent routers and
