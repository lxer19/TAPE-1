Abstract: This paper describes and analyzes a method for finding nontrivial solutions of the inequality Ax 0, where A is an mfin matrix of rank n. The method is based on the observation that a certain function f has a unique minimum if and only if the inequality fails to have a nontrivial solution. Moreover, if there is a solution, an attempt to minimize f will produce a sequence that will diverge in a direction that converges to a solution of the inequality. The technique can also be used to solve inhomogeneous inequalities and hence linear programming problems, although no claims are made about competitiveness with existing methods.

Reference-contexts: It is this necessity that accounts for most of the technical detail in the paper. In 1952, Motzkin [3] proposed finding solutions of (1.1) by minimizing (1.2). The author [5] rediscovered the method independently in connection with problems in the statistical analysis of categorical data (for the connection see <ref> [1, Ch.2] </ref>), and the algorithm has actually been incorporate into a set of programs for solving such problems. In the next section we shall introduce some preliminary notation and definitions.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 The function f has a minimum if and only if the inequality (1.1) has a nontrivial solution. Proof. First suppose that (1.1) does not have a nontrivial solution. To show that f has a minimum, it is sufficient to show <ref> [4, x4.3.3] </ref> that for any norm 2 lim kxk!1 f (x) = +1. For any x with kxk = 1 set (x) = minfa T i x : i 2 N (x)g: Since (1.1) has no solution, N (x) is nonempty and (x) &lt; 0. Clearly is continuous.
