Reference-contexts: constructions of small sets with low discrepancy in high dimensional space and have applications to derandomizing randomized algorithms. 1.1 Introduction The problem of constructing small sample spaces that "approximate" the independent distribution on n random variables has received considerable attention recently (cf. [7, Chor Goldreich] [9, Karp Wigderson], [12, Luby], <ref> [1, Alon Babai Itai] </ref>, [15, Naor Naor], [2, Alon Goldreich H-astad Peralta], [3, Azar Motwani Naor]). <p> The culmination of previous works are constructions of small sample spaces that approximate a constant amount of independence for general random variables (see for example [12, Luby] or <ref> [1, Alon Babai Itai] </ref>) or that approximate complete independence for identically and uniformly distributed boolean-valued random variables [15, Naor Naor], [2, Alon Goldreich H-astad Peralta], [3, Azar Motwani Naor]). <p> that are k-wise independent approximations for U n;m of size maxfn; mg k , and that are (k; *)-approximations for general P n;m with size (maxfn; k=*g) k , are implicit in many works; a brief survey of some of these constructions can be found in either [12, Luby] or <ref> [1, Alon Babai Itai] </ref>.

Although previous results are sufficient for some applications to derandomizing algorithms, in many applications what is needed is a small sample space that approximates more than a constant amount of independence for general random variables. <p> Simpler constructions with a sample space of size O ((n log (n)) 2 =* 2 ) for U n;2 were subsequently presented in <ref> [2, Alon Goldreich H-astad Peralta] </ref>. These constructions can be extended to U n;m , basically using the same ideas, but in a slightly more complicated way (cf.

Simpler constructions using a support of size O ((k log n) 2 2 k 1 * 2 ), were presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. These constructions can be easily extended to approximate identical random variables, each uniformly distributed over a finite field (cf. [2, 3, 8]).

Reference-contexts: The obvious corollary to this theorem we use to prove the result stated at the beginning of this section is that S (R k n;m ) = 0 implies that S (R n;m ) 2 (k) . This theorem should be contrasted with the main theorem of <ref> [11, Linial Nisan] </ref>. Loosely stated, the above theorem says that if the leading O (log (1=*)) terms of the inclusion-exclusion formula are exactly the same as they are for the independent distribution then the probability of the union of n events is completely determined to within an error *. <p> Loosely stated, one direction of the main theorem in <ref> [11, Linial Nisan] </ref> says that an arbitrary specification of less than p n of the leading terms doesn't even determine the probability of the union of the n events to within a constant amount.

Reference-contexts: This case is important to some applications, and in particular this construction improves the running time of some of the algorithms presented in <ref> [13, Luby Velickovic] </ref>. The second and third constructions for n general random variables yield samples spaces that are *-approximations for general P n;m , where the size of the sample space is polynomial in (n=*) log (1=*) for the second construction and polynomial in (n=*) log (n) for the third. <p> It should be noted that this analysis uses components of analysis for "Discrete Distribution Generating tree" described in [10, Knuth Yao] and also component of an analysis presented in <ref> [13, Luby Velickovic] </ref>.

Although previous results are sufficient for some applications to derandomizing algorithms, in many applications what is needed is a small sample space that approximates more than a constant amount of independence for general random variables. <p> On the other hand, it has been shown that the sample space has to be of size at least n k=2 in order to be a k-wise independent approximation for U n;2 [6, Chor Freidmann Goldreich H-astad Rudich Smolensky], and for non-constant k this is not polynomial in n. <ref> [15, Naor Naor] </ref> introduced the idea of allowing the error parameter * and gave an ingenious construction of a sample space that is an *-approximation for U n;2 where the size of the sample space is O (n log (n)=* 4 ). <p> Thus, the construction of a sample space of polynomial size that is a pairwise independent approximation for general P n;m can be used to convert these randomized algorithms into deterministic algorithms. In other applications (see <ref> [15, Naor Naor] </ref>), approximations of identically and uniformly distributed boolean-valued random variables suffice. However, in the more typical application the random variables are general and more than a constant amount of independence is required in the analysis, and thus it is of primary importance to develop constructions for these cases. <p> For these values of l, k 0 and * 0 we can use <ref> [15, Naor Naor] </ref> or [2, Alon Goldreich H-astad Peralta] to construct a sample space S which induces a distribution on x 1 1 ; : : : ; x l n ; : : : ; x l n that is a (k 0 ; * 0 )-approximation for U nl;2 <p> of (k-wise) approximating an arbitrary product distribution to the extensively studied special case of (k-wise) approximating uniform distribu tion over f0; 1g n . 2.1 Introduction In recent years, much research effort has been invested in constructing small sample spaces for k-wise independent and almost k-wise independent random variables (cf. <ref> [7, 1, 15, 2, 3] </ref>). <p> In particaulr, Naor and Naor <ref> [15] </ref> presented an efficient k-wise *- approximation of identical random variables each uniformly distributed over f0; 1g. The support of their approximation has cardinality O ((k log n) 2 2k 1 * 4 ).

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we describe three constructions of small sample spaces that are approximations of the independent distribution for general P n;m ; the first two constructions are new and the third is a construction based on a theorem in <ref> [16, Nisan] </ref>. The first construction yields a sample space that is a (k; *)-approximation, where the size of the sample space is polynomial in log (n), 2 k and 1=*. <p> This gives some partial justification for modeling "real world" events, which are somewhat independent but not totally so, by events that are totally independent, without drastically affecting the probability of their union. 1.3.3 Construction based on hashing The third construction uses the results given in section 5 of <ref> [16, Nisan] </ref> and observation 4 of section 1.2.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the previous bound on the sample space size, implicit in the classical work on discrepancy theory (see e.g. [4, Beck Chen] or <ref> [17, Niederreiter] </ref>), is polynomial in n n =*. <p> The discrepancy problem can be stated as follows: given n and *, construct a set S in [0; 1) n with S (R n ) *. As we describe (and as also has been describe before by others, e.g. <ref> [17, Niederreiter] </ref>), there is an close connection between discrepancy and approximating independent distributions of n general random variables. Our primary interest in sets with small discrepancy is that they are universal for the problem of constructing sample spaces that are good approximations for general distributions. <p> Classical work on the discrepancy problem concentrates on minimizing the size of S primarily as a function of 1=* and then secondarily as a function of n [4, Beck Chen], <ref> [17, Niederreiter] </ref>, i.e. the dimension n is thought of as arbitrary but fixed and the goal is to find a set S with size as small as possible as a function of 1=*. <p> In contrast to these new results, the previous known bounds from classical discrepancy theory on the size of an explicitly constructible set S in [0; 1) n with small discrepancy are exponential in n [4, Beck Chen], <ref> [17, Niederreiter] </ref>. It is easy to see that a random set of points S in [0; 1) n of size cn log (n=*)=* 2 for some constant c &gt; 1 has the property that S (R n ) * with high probability.
