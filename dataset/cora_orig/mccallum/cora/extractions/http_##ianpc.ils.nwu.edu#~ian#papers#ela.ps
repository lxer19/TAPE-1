Title: Integrating vision and natural language without central models  
Author: Ian Horswill

Affiliation: MIT AI Lab  
Abstract: Ludwig answers natural language queries about a simple scenes using a real-time vision system based on current biological theories of vision. Ludwig is unusual in that it does not use a propositional database to model the world. Instead, it simulates the interface of a traditional world model by providing plug-compatible operations that are implemented directly using real-time vision. Logic variables are bound to image regions, rather than complex data structures, while predicates, relations, and existential queries are computed on demand by the vision system. This architecture allow Ludwig to "use the world as its own best model" in the most literal sense. The resulting simplifications in the modeling, reasoning, and parsing systems allow them to be implemented as communicating finite state machines, thus giving them a weak biological plausibility. The resulting system is highly pipelined and incremental, allowing noun phrase referents to be visually determined even before the entire sentence has been parsed.

Reference-contexts: The semantic component also allocates a new shift register when a phrase boundary is found. Visual system Ludwig uses the visual system from the Bertrand system (Horswill 1995), which is based on the visual attention theory of Koch and Ullman <ref> (Koch and Ullman 1985) </ref>, Ullman's visual routines theory of intermediate vision (Ullman 1984), and Chapman's extensions to it (Chapman 1990). The vision system runs at 10Hz on a real-time digital signal processing board designed by Chris Barnhart at MIT.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In the last decade, many AI researchers have explored alternatives to traditional architectures in which components of the mind communicate through a central propositional database <ref> (Rumelhardt et al. 1986) </ref>(Brooks 1986)(Agre and Chapman 1987)(Rosen-schein and Kaelbling 1986). Database architectures have four distinct disadvantages. First, the database forms a bottleneck through which all other modules must communicate. <p> In part to avoid the implementation complexities of lisp-like systems, many researchers have explored architectures that are much closer to the hardware. Connectionism has focused on the use of relatively uniform networks of simple devices, often in conjunction with local learning rules for adjusting device parameters <ref> (Rumelhardt et al. 1986) </ref>. Autonomous agent architecture researchers have used networks of finite state machines (Brooks 1986)(Rosenschein and Kael-bling 1986) and variations on spreading-activation analog networks (Maes 1989). Situated action researchers have even used raw logic gates (Agre and Chapman 1987). <p> The use of random bit patterns is unnecessary, but it has the advantages that (1) sets can be represented by bitwise-or ("coarse coding", see <ref> (Rumelhardt et al. 1986) </ref> chapter 3), thus allowing a marker to have multiple tags, and (2) tags for groups of registers or markers can be or'ed together so that the system can determine in unit time if some subsystem is binding a given role.

Reference-contexts: Temporal-synchrony variable binding (Shastri and Ajjanagadde 1993) allows small numbers of small dynamic structures to be manipulated through a time-domain multiplexing technique. It presupposes phased-locked-loop circuitry whose neu-roanatomical reality is highly controversial. Hender-son (Henderson 1994) has recently shown that TSVB is sufficient to implement a sophisticated description-based parser. Touretzky <ref> (Touretzky 1990) </ref> showed how to emulate a standard lisp engine in a Boltzmann network, thus reintroducing the advantages of von-Neumann processing, but also much of its seriality. <p> Finally, any cell that notices its name on the left child bus sets its right child register to the name on the active bus. While complicated, this does actually work, and it's infinitely simpler than ephemeral GC. Alternatively, one could use Touretzky's techniques <ref> (Touretzky 1990) </ref>. Ludwig contains a store of 20 cells that can dynamically simulate multiple shift registers in this way. Note that although these simulation techniques have been successfully implemented and tested, they are no longer used on Ludwig for speed reasons.
