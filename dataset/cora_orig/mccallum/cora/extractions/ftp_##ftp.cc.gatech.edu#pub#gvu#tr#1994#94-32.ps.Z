Abstract: In this paper we describe a method for modeling the dynamic behavior of splashing fluids. The model simulates the behavior of a fluid when objects impact or float on its surface. The forces generated by the objects create waves and splashes on the surface of the fluid. To demonstrate the realism and limitations of the model, images from a computer-generated animation are presented and compared with video frames of actual splashes occuring under similar initial conditions.

Reference-contexts: Chen and Lobo implemented a similar system that uses a simplification of the 3D Navier-Stokes Equations to model fluid behavior in the presence of moving obstacles <ref> [1] </ref>. Although these systems provide a good set of tools for modeling the behavior of waves and falling water, we would like to model the interaction of water with other objects.

Reference-contexts: Fournier and Reeves <ref> [2] </ref> and Peachy [7] implemented techniques that model the movement of explicit waves over the surface of a fluid. They used functions that describe the shape of a wave to displace a model representing the free surface of the fluid.

Reference-contexts: An efficient approach to the problem of simulating solid volumes of water is to use a system that models a simplified subset of the fluid dynamics. Kass and Miller <ref> [3] </ref> used this approach and represented the surface with a height field, modeling the flow between adjacent columns of fluid. With this method, surface artifacts, such as waves, do not need to be explicitly specified because they arise naturally from the physical conditions occurring within the system.

Reference-contexts: One of the most accurate is to solve the 3D Navier-Stokes equations describing the fluid system <ref> [4] </ref>. This approach requires dividing the space that the fluid occupies into a lattice of cells and computing the behavior of the fluid as it moves through the cells.

Reference-contexts: Phenomena such as spray or loosely packed water droplets are easily modeled by this technique. Systems that allow particle interactions have been used to model fountains of fluid and amorphous solids <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> The visual appearance of the model could be improved by using a more sophisticated spray model that took into account the cohesion between drops of water such as the one described in <ref> [5] </ref>. Figure 7 shows a comparison between an actual splash and a simulation where we attempted to match the initial conditions of the actual splash.

Reference-contexts: When used to determine the flow, equation (1) is an approximation because it relies on the assumption that the fluid is not moving rapidly <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition to the pressure due to gravity, we model external forces to simulate the impact of objects on the surface of the fluid.

Reference-contexts: Grid points contact four columns and the external pressure is evenly distributed across these columns. 3.3 Spray Model To model droplets that are disconnected from the main body of the fluid, we implemented a particle system using techniques similar to those described by Reeves <ref> [8] </ref> and Sims [9].
