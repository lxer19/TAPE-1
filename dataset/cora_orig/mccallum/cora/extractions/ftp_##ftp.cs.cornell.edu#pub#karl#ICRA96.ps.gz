Abstract: Programmable vector fields can be used to control a variety of flexible planar parts feeders. These devices can exploit exotic actuation technologies such as arrayed, massively-parallel microfabricated motion pixels or transversely vibrating (macroscopic) plates. These new automation designs promise great flexibility, speed, and dexterity|we believe they may be employed to orient, singulate, sort, feed, and assemble parts. However, since they have only recently been invented, programming and controlling them for manipulation tasks is challenging. When a part is placed on our devices, the programmed vector field induces a force and moment upon it. Over time, the part may come to rest in a dynamic equilibrium state. We demonstrate lower bounds (i.e., impossibility results) on what the devices cannot do, and results on a classification of control strategies yielding design criteria by which well-behaved manipulation strategies may be developed. We suggest sufficient conditions for programmable fields to induce well-behaved equilibria on every part placed on our devices. We define composition operators to build complex strategies from simple ones, and show the resulting fields are also well-behaved. We discuss whether fields outside this class can be useful and free of pathology. Using these tools, we describe new manipulation algorithms. In particular, we improve existing planning algorithms by a quadratic factor, and the plan-length by a linear factor. Using our new and improved strategies, we show how to simultaneously orient and pose any part, without sensing, from an arbitrary initial configuration. We relax earlier dynamic and mechanical assumptions to obtain more robust and flexible strategies. Finally, we consider parts feeders that can only implement a very limited "vocabulary" of vector fields. We discuss the tradeoff between mechanical complexity and planning complexity.

One may ask whether, using another class of potential field strategies, unique equilibria may be obtained without discrete switching. We believe that continuously varying vector fields of the form (1 t)F + t G, where t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> represents time, and F and G are squeezes, may lead to vector fields that have this property. Here "+" denotes point-wise addition of vector fields, and we will write "F ; G" for the resulting continuously varying field.

Reference-contexts: B. Every connected polygon has O (n 2 ) stable ori entation equilibria in a squeeze field. There exist simple polygons with n vertices that can be bisected by a straight line in up to O (n 2 ) topologically different ways <ref> [2] </ref>. This suggests that there could be parts that have (n 2 ) equilibria in a squeeze field, which would imply alignment plans of length (n 2 ) and planning complexity (n 4 ).

(x 0 ; y 0 ) is the corresponding translation equilibrium, and 0 is the corresponding orientation equilibrium. To model our actuator arrays and vibratory devices, in <ref> [5] </ref> we made the following assumptions: Density: The generated forces can be described by a vector field, i.e. the individual microactuators are dense compared to the size of the moving part. 2Phase: The motion of a part has two phases: (1) Pure translation towards l until the part is in force <p> Note that due to the elasticity and oscillation of the actuator surfaces, we can assume continuous area contact, and not just contact in three or a few points. Relaxing assumption 2Phase is one of the key results of this paper. The main result of <ref> [5] </ref> is summarized in the following Theorem (see Figure 4): Theorem 3 [5] For a connected polygonal part P and an actuator array A there exists an alignment strategy S = (l 1 ; : : : ; l k ) that uniquely orients P up to symmetries. <p> Relaxing assumption 2Phase is one of the key results of this paper.

Example: Morphing and combining vector fields. Our strategies from <ref> [5] </ref> (see Section 3) have switch points in time where the vector field changes discontinuously (Figure 4). This is because we have shown that after one squeeze, for every part, the orientation equilibria form a finite set of possible configurations, but in general there exists no unique equilibrium. <p> The existing prototype devices exhibit only a limited range of programmability.

Reference-contexts: Uncertainty. In practice, neither the force vector field nor the part geometry will be exact, and both can only be characterized up to tolerances <ref> [7] </ref>. This is particularly important at micro scale. Within the framework of potential fields, we can express this uncertainty by considering not one single potential function U P , but rather families of potentials that correspond to different values within the uncertainty range.
