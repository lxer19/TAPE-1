The physical network consists of node and link components. <p> We considered three algorithms: SPF, Merlin-Segall, and Extended Bellman-Ford, of which the last two are distance-vector algorithms. We considered the NSFNET-backbone network with today's hardware as well as a future high-speed hardware. We considered varying uniform and skewed workloads and failure distributions. Simulation results so far (explained in <ref> [4] </ref>) indicate that Extended Bellman-Ford is as good as SPF for good link cost functions. Furthermore, Extended Bellman-Ford is far less sensitive to changes in the link cost function. <p> Furthermore, Extended Bellman-Ford is far less sensitive to changes in the link cost function. Merlin-Segall performs significantly worse than SPF and Extended Bellman-Ford except at very high and very low loads, and it is very sensitive to changes in link cost function <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: MaRS provides a flexible platform for the evaluation and comparison of network routing algorithms. It has an optional graphical (X Window System) interface. It is implemented in C on a UNIX platform. (The event handling and user interface routines come from a network simulator developed at MIT <ref> [5] </ref>.) MaRS allows the user to define a network configuration, control its simulation, log the values of selected parameters, and save, load, and modify network configurations. The scheduling of events can be done using random number generators, trace files, or both.
