Title: RSVP: A New Resource ReSerVation Protocol (PRELIMINARY DRAFT)  
Author: Lixia Zhang Steve Deering Deborah Estrin Scott Shenker Daniel Zappala flixia, deering, 
Abstract: This paper presents the design of a resource reservation protocol, RSVP, that supports both unicast and multicast applications, even when the number of sources and/or receivers is very large. Several novel features in the RSVP design lead to the unique flexibility and scalability of the protocol. RSVP is receiver-oriented, in that the receiver of the data flow is responsible for the initiation of the resource reservation; this allows RSVP to accommodate heterogeneous receivers in a multicast group. RSVP provides several reservation styles that allow applications to specify how reservations for the same multicast group should be aggregated at the intermediate switches; this results in more efficient utilization of network resources. Finally, RSVP uses "soft-state" in the switches, enabling it to gracefully support dynamic membership changes and automatically adapt to routing changes.

Reference-contexts: For example, our protocol should be capable of establishing reservations across networks that implement different routing algorithms, such as IP unicast routing, IP multicast routing [4], the recently proposed CBT (Core-Based Tree) multicast routing <ref> [1] </ref>, or some future routing protocols. 5 Thus, in summary, we have identified seven important design goals: 4 Clearly a particular implementation of RSVP will be tied quite closely to the flowspec and interfaces used by the routing and admission control algorithms. <p> Thus, S1's path state contains the following entry: incoming links <ref> [1, 6] </ref>; outgoing links [2 (sources:H1|H4|H5), 6 (sources:H1)] Though we have not shown it, S1 also keeps state information that indicates, for each source, the previous hop address from which data from that source arrives.

Reference-contexts: When S1 receives R1 (B, no-filter), it first reserves resources over L1 (in the direction from S1 towards H1), then attaches the following reservation state to the path state to indicate the amount of the reservation made over L1: outgoing links <ref> [1 (B), 2, 6] </ref> Finally, S1 forwards R1 (B, no-filter) over all incoming-links, in this case L2 and L6. Note that the switch never forwards any RSVP message over the link the message came from. <p> . 7 Related Work In the course of exploring network algorithms that deliver quality of service guarantees, there have been several proposals and prototype implementations of network resource reservation algorithms 15 Dartnet is a cross-country network testbed sponsored by DARPA. 16 over the last few years (see, for example, [5], <ref> [2] </ref>).

The idea of the receiver-initiated approach was first inspired by Deering's work on IP multicast routing <ref> [4] </ref>. The IP multicast routing protocol treats senders and receivers separately. A sender sends to a multicast group in exactly the same way as it sends to a single receiver; it merely puts in each packet a multicast group address in place of a host address. <p> S3's path state contains the following entries: incoming links <ref> [4, 7] </ref> outgoing links [3 (sources:H1|H4|H5), 4 (sources:H1|H5), 7 (sources:H4)] Upon receiving R2 (B, H4), S3 reserves B over L7, and forwards the message to H4. When the message reaches H4, a pipe of B has been reserved from H4 to H2.
