Reference-contexts: We believe hidden algebra is the natural next step in the evolution of algebraic semantics and its first order proof technology. Hidden algebra originated in [4], and developed further in <ref> [5, 6, 1, 8, 3] </ref> among other places; the most comprehensive survey currently available is [8]. Proofs by coinduction are dual to proofs by induction, in that the former are based on a largest congruence, and the latter on a smallest subalgebra (e.g., see [8]).
