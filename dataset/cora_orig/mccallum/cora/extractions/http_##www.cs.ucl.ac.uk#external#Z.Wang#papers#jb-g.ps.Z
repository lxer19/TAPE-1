Title: Analysis of Burstiness and Jitter in Multimedia Communications

Abstract: In this paper, we examine burstiness and jitter in multimedia communications. We assume that the synchronization process is adaptive and the traffic stream can be divided into smaller synchronization units. We model the traffic in a synchronization unit with two parameters, and define jitter with the delay experienced by the first packet in a synchronization unit as the target delay. We then obtain results on the relationship between burstiness and jitter, and on the upper bounds of burstiness and jitter.

Reference-contexts: We can view a 1 + r min A (a 1 ,a m ) hhhhhhhhh as the expected arrival time and b m as the difference between the actual arrival time and the expected arrival time. In this sense, the expected arrival time is similar to the Virtual Clock <ref> [3] </ref>. A packet arrived at its expected arrival time experiences no queuing delay.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the actual delay offset used by the application varies with the network conditions. The recent experience with packet voice protocols has shown that adjusting the delay offset is feasible and the impacts on the performance are often imperceptible if the adjustment is carried out during silent periods <ref> [9] </ref>. In this paper, we assume that the application can adjust the offset delay at the beginning of a synchronization unit. A synchronization unit is defined as a group of packets that share a common fixed delay offset [9]. <p> are often imperceptible if the adjustment is carried out during silent periods <ref> [9] </ref>. In this paper, we assume that the application can adjust the offset delay at the beginning of a synchronization unit. A synchronization unit is defined as a group of packets that share a common fixed delay offset [9]. The delay offset may be adjusted at the beginning of a synchronization unit but should remain unchanged until the end of that synchronization unit. The boundary of a synchronization unit is application-dependent, for example, the most common synchronization units are talkspurts for voice and frames for video.

Reference-contexts: We assume that all packets are of the same size and the packet header carries an one-bit indicator, such as the s bit in the audio/video transport protocol <ref> [10] </ref>, which marks the boundary of the synchronization units. One of the problems in analyzing jitter is how to model the traffic. It is hard to fit multimedia traffic into conventional statistical models as they are often time-varying and algorithm-dependent.

Reference-contexts: This implies the minimum and maximum rate ratio can be used as a measure of burstiness. Jitter is usually defined as the difference between the delay that a packet has experienced and the target delay for the flow <ref> [11] </ref>. Since the synchronization is assumed to be adaptive, the target delay can be adjusted at the beginning of a synchronization unit. In this paper, we use the delay experi enced by the first packet of a synchronization unit as the tar-get delay.

Reference-contexts: The (r max , r min ) pair is a generalization of characteristics in variable rate audio and video traffic. In digital audio with silence suppression, there is a clear pattern of busy periods and silent periods <ref> [13] </ref>. A synchronization unit starts with a busy period followed by a silent period. In such cases, r max equals to the sampling rate during the busy period and r min equals to the average rate of the whole unit. Similar patterns are also observed in variable rate video [14].
