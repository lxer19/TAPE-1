Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of blind identification and source separation which consists of estimation of the mixing matrix and/or the separation of a mixture of stochastically independent sources without a priori knowledge on the mixing matrix . The method we propose here estimates the mixture matrix by a recurrent Input-Output (IO) Identification using as inputs a nonlinear transformation of the estimated sources. Herein, the nonlinear transformation (distortion) consists in constraining the modulus of the inputs of the IO-Identification device to be a constant. In contrast to other existing approaches, the covariance of the additive noise do not need to be modeled and can be estimated as a regular parameter if needed. The proposed approach is implemented using multi-layer neural networks in order to improve performance of separation. New associated on-line un-supervised adaptive learning rules are also developed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by some computer simulations.
