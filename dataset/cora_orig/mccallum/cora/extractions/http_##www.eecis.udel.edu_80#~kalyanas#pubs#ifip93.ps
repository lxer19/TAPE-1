Abstract: Network Management is an area of active current research. The problems in managing networks have been compounded by the existence of different standards. These problems can be solved by either forcing just one standard or by achieving unified management of dissimilar networks connected together. The latter solution is the one that is feasible. In this paper, we discuss and contrast two network management models (Internet and OSI) that are prevalent, define problems and issues involved in managing a network belonging to the Internet domain from an OSI domain, develop a paradigm that achieves uniform management of networks (using an application gateway approach) in either domain and present the justification for such a paradigm. Based on the paradigm developed, guidelines for the design of an application gateway are laid out. Future research directions based on this effort are included.

Reference-contexts: Research has been done [WS90] and is ongoing [Kni92] to achieve a unified network management environment. This paper develops a paradigm based on an application gateway approach [Ros90] that helps achieve internetworking of networks supporting the Internet model [RM90] and the OSI model <ref> [DIS90a] </ref> of network management. We first describe and contrast these two models in Section 2 of this paper. In Section 3 we discuss different paradigms for internetworking and justify the selection of one paradigm to achieve internetworking namely the use of an application gateway. <p> The main idea is to provide a flavor for these two frameworks and to try and contrast the two models.

Reference-contexts: As in the Internet model, each OSI agent controls a MIB. However, the structures of the MIBs in the two models are very different. The OSI model follows an object-oriented approach. Figure 1 (d) highlights the managed object definition principles <ref> [DIS90b] </ref> used in this model. An OSI managed object is defined by the following: attributes, behavior, notifications and operations. <p> A column variable in a row is identified uniquely by suffixing the value of the index to the OID of the column field that needs to be operated upon. The OSI scheme offers an approach where a set of guidelines are provided for object definition <ref> [DIS90b] </ref> and a user is allowed to specify the definition of object classes based on these guidelines. In the OSI framework, object classes are named using OIDs. Each attribute of an object is identified using an OID. <p> A Distinguished Name (DN) is obtained by concatenating the RDNs from the root of the instance tree to the node which represents the object instance being considered. The reader is referred to <ref> [DIS90b, Bla92, DIS90c] </ref> for further details on OSI object definitions and naming. Since the two schemes are radically different, finding an efficient and clean method of mapping objects from one scheme to the other is of great importance in achieving internetworking.

Reference-contexts: The agent may also generate event reports asynchronously to be sent to the manager. The manager-agent interactions are supported by an OSI standard management service known as the Common Management Information Service (CMIS) <ref> [DIS90d] </ref>, implemented by the OSI standard management protocol called the Common Management Information Protocol (CMIP) [IS987]. As in the Internet model, each OSI agent controls a MIB. However, the structures of the MIBs in the two models are very different. The OSI model follows an object-oriented approach.

Reference-contexts: The name used to identify an object is called an Object Identifier (OID) which is a unique name in a global name tree. The management protocol supported by the Internet Management domain is the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) 1 <ref> [JDCD90] </ref>. SNMP is built over the well known User Datagram Protocol (UDP) [Pos80]. SNMP supports four basic operations: Get allows a manager to query an agent about the value of a particular variable. GetNext is a powerful operation that allows MIB traversal and facilitates table entry accesses.

Reference-contexts: With this paradigm existing managers cannot achieve internetworking without implementing the functions mentioned. The second paradigm (Figure 2 (b)), attempts internetworking using the concept of duplicate MIBs. This approach maps objects in the Internet MIB onto corresponding objects in an OSI MIB (for instance, MIB-II is mapped into OIM-II) <ref> [RFC91] </ref>. In this paradigm each node has an implementation of an SNMP agent as well as a CMIP agent. The Internet MIB and its mapped OSI counterpart are present at each Internet node.

The Internet model defines objects (Figure 1 (c)) <ref> [RM90, RM91] </ref> which have the following features: access, status, name and syntax. Access controls read/write privileges, status classifies the managed object as optional, mandatory or obsolete vis-a-vis implementation, name denotes the name of the managed object and syntax defines the object specification syntax.

Reference-contexts: The scalar objects are named using Object Identifiers (OIDs) that are unique. The instance is identified using a standard suffix to these OIDs <ref> [Ros91a] </ref>. The table objects are defined in terms of the rows with each row object being made of several column fields. Each column field is named using an OID. Uniqueness of a row entry is achieved by using a sequence of fields called the index.

The three paradigms are shown in Figures 2 (a), 2 (b) and 2 (c). The first paradigm (Figure 2 (a)), has most of the complexity built into the Network Management Station <ref> [WS90] </ref>. This paradigm implements a three tier system with the topmost tier being the management applications with suitable user interfaces, an intermediate layer (Network Management Language System (NMLS)) that provides a standard management command interface to protocol stack machines 2 and finally the stack machines themselves.
