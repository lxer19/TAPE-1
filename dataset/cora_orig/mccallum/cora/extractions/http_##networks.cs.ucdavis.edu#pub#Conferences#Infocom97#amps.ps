Abstract: Optical networks based on passive star couplers and employing wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) have been proposed for deployment in local and metropolitan areas. Amplifiers are required in such networks to compensate for the power losses due to splitting and attenuation. However, an optical amplifier has constraints on the maximum gain and the maximum output power it can supply; thus optical amplifier placement becomes a challenging problem. The general problem of minimizing the total amplifier count, subject to the device constraints, is a mixed-integer non-linear problem. Previous studies have attacked the amplifier-placement problem by adding the "artificial" constraint that all wavelengths, which are present at a particular point in a fiber, be at the same power level. In this paper, we present a method to solve the minimum-amplifier-placement problem while avoiding the equally-powered-wavelength constraint. We demonstrate that, by allowing signals to operate at different power levels, our method can reduce the number of amplifiers required in several small to medium-sized networks.

Reference-contexts: A non-reflective star consists of pairs of inputs and outputs, and each output carries all of the wavelengths that were incident on all of the inputs except for the wavelengths that were carried on its own paired input. Such stars have been employed in the Level-0 All-Optical Network (AON) <ref> [1] </ref>. Non-reflective stars are needed in order to avoid interference due to loops ("echoes") in the network.

Reference-contexts: We expect to be able to create a reasonably-accurate gain model of the popular Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). Analytical methods for modeling the amplifier gain, gain saturation, and noise described in <ref> [2] </ref> will be incorporated in the model. We also plan to expand our amplifier gain model to handle per-wavelength gain. This would allow us to model an amplifier that has a non-flat gain spectrum.

For reasonable network parameters, this network can operate without using any amplifiers. However, if the power levels for all wavelengths must be equal on any given link, as required by the MILP approach in <ref> [8] </ref>, then an amplifier (on one of the links between stars A and B) will have to be added to the network. <p> Numerical examples will show that this network-wide optimization method without the equal-power constraint often results in solutions that require fewer amplifiers than the solutions in <ref> [4, 8] </ref>. 2 Solution Approach Given a network as in Fig. 1, we would like to minimize the number of amplifiers used in the network without violating the device capabilities and constraints. <p> Hence, we have * number of variables = 2 L + N , * number of integer constraints = L, and * number of non-linear inequalities = 6 L. 2.1.8 Reasons for Non-linearities The approach presented in this paper differs from the one in <ref> [8] </ref> in that it allows the different wavelengths on a link to be at different power levels.

Whereas the method in [8] needed to place amplifiers whenever all the wavelengths on the link were at their lowest power level, now the placement of the amplifier is constrained by the weakest signal on the link. <p> However, we could also use the solution from <ref> [8] </ref> as a feasible starting point. Since the new objective function is not identical to the one in the integral case, the solver might end up minimizing the exact function SG l =gmax l and not the number of amplifiers in the network. <p> If the number of wavelengths on a link is precomputed, this allowed the algorithm to operate on each link individually (locally) without knowing what was happening on other links. This led to a very simple amplifier-placement algorithm. Unfortunately, as was shown in <ref> [8] </ref> and can also be seen in Table 2, this approach does not minimize the number of amplifiers needed in the network. The transmitter powers can be adjusted to avoid placing amplifiers on the links which originate at a station. <p> We show the results of this algorithm for various networks in column 2 of Table 2. The global method in <ref> [8] </ref>, allowed wavelengths at the beginning of the links to be above the absolute minimum allowed, p sen . <p> Taking into account the attenuation loss along the links connecting the stars and the splitting losses at the stars, we require that there be at least one amplifier on either of these links. The lower bound on the number of amplifiers required using the Linear-Program (LP) method in <ref> [8] </ref> is thus M 1, where M is the number of stars in the network. (See [8] for details.)
