Reference-contexts: The levels of both average and best fitness then rise significantly, due to the the discovery of novel, highly-fit building blocks. After a renewed period of exponential increase, these increases taper off, as the average population fitness approaches the level of the best individuals <ref> (Holland 1988) </ref>. The cycle then repeats at the next migration phase.

Reference-contexts: This paper contributes towards filling this gap by evaluating the performance of the DGA relative to the CGA on a class of fitness functions called the Royal Road functions: 1 and 2 (Mitchell et al. 1992; For-rest & Mitchell 1993), 3 <ref> (Mitchell & Holland 1993) </ref>, and 4 (Mitchell et al. 1994). Though highly contrived, these functions have a fixed number of predetermined schemata, allowing researchers to study GA performance over time. Due to space constraints, they will not be described here.

Reference-contexts: The process can also occur in a continuous population of small overlapping neighborhoods (Rouhani & Barton 1987). Theoretical studies have shown that a surprisingly small amount of migration suffices to disperse an advantageous gene complex throughout the population <ref> (Phillips 1993) </ref>. This research has been supported by laboratory experiments (Wade & Goodnight 1991), but it is unclear whether the right combination of migration, drift, and selection exists in nature for this process to take place.

Reference-contexts: This subpopulation produces an excess of offspring, due to its high average fitness, which then emigrate to the other subpopulations, spreading the newly-discovered gene complex throughout the population. The process can also occur in a continuous population of small overlapping neighborhoods <ref> (Rouhani & Barton 1987) </ref>. Theoretical studies have shown that a surprisingly small amount of migration suffices to disperse an advantageous gene complex throughout the population (Phillips 1993).

Reference-contexts: Island-model GAs derive their name from population genetics, where the term denotes a population split into many semi-isolated subpopulations, like an archipelago of islands. These GAs are also called medium- or coarse-grained parallel GAs, or distributed GAs. Besides Tanese's DGA <ref> (Tanese 1987, 1989a, 1989b) </ref>, island-model GAs have been investigated by Pettey et al. (1987), Cohoon et al. (1987), and Sumida (1990), among others. Whitley (1993) has investigated the DGA using a formal model.

Reference-contexts: It is also debated whether local fitness peaks are common in the high-dimensional fitness spaces of organisms <ref> (Turner 1987) </ref>. Cohoon et al. (1987) argued that the DGA's success was due to another phenomenon, Eldredge and Gould's theory of punctuated equilibrium.
