Abstract: Table 4. Comparison of different sizing algorithm when sizing 16-bit buses under 2x-6x minimum pitch-spacing. MIN is the minimum wire width (and thus maximum spacing) solution; GISS/FAF and GISS/VAF are bottom-up dynamic programming algorithms; GISS/ELR is the algorithm presented in this paper. outside the range defined by the resulting lower and upper bounds, and we denote it as GISS/VAF. We optimized the bus for different initial pitch-spacings, from 2x to 6x of the minimum pitch-spacing (0.55m). We report the average HSPICE delay among all sinks in Table 4. The MIN is the solution with minimum wire width and thus largest spacing to reduce the coupling capacitance. It serves as the base for delay comparison. GISS/FAF and GISS/VAF further use a greedy algorithm to obtain final solutions within the lower and upper bounds, whereas GISS/ELR uses the lower bound as the final solution due to its higher convergence. All GISS algorithms lead to solutions much better than the MIN solution. Because the GISS problem is no longer a bounded-variation CH-posynomial program in case of large pitch-spacings, GISS/ELR achieves more improvement (11% better than GISS/FAF and 5.9% better than GISS/VAF for 6x minimum pitch-spacing). GISS/ELR is also 100x faster and uses much less memory. Detailed analysis on memory usage and convergence of bounds is included in [12]. We formulated a new class of optimization problem, named the general CH-posynomial program, and propose an algorithm to compute lower and upper bounds of the exact solution to the general CH-posynomial program. We applied the algorithm to solve device and wire sizing problems, with consideration of DSM issues like the table-based models for device delay and interconnect capacitances including crosstalk capacitance between neighboring wires. Our algorithm achieves more delay reduction when compared with previous work, and is also extremely efficient. We plan to extend the algorithm to consider the higher-order delay model in the future. We believe that our general CH-posynomial formulation and the bound-computation algorithm can also be applied to other optimization problems in the CAD field. [2] J. Cong and C.-K.
