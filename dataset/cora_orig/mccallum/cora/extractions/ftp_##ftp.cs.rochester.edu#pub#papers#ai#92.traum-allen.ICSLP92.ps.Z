Title: A "SPEECH ACTS" APPROACH TO GROUNDING IN CONVERSATION  
Author: David R. Traum and James F. Allen 
Address: Rochester, New York 14627-0226 USA  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department University of Rochester  
Abstract: We propose that Grounding, the process of achieving mutual understanding between participants in a conversation, be analyzed in terms of the actions performed by the conversants which contribute to achieving this mutual understanding. We propose a set of Grounding Acts which facilitate this analysis. This paper describes Grounding Acts, and a "grammar" stipulating which series of performance of grounding acts result in grounded content.

Reference-contexts: If a DU is left in one of the non-final states, then its contents should not be seen as grounded. 4 Examples of Grounding Acts Table 4 presents a small spoken conversation fragment from the TRAINS domain <ref> [1] </ref>, annotated with examples of grounding acts. The table can be read as follows: the first column shows the speaker, M, or S.

Reference-contexts: Mutual belief seems to require positive effort by both parties in a conversation, and thus traditional speech acts are inherently multi-agent actions, requiring several utterances in order to be realized. This process of reaching common ground is called grounding. Clark & Schaefer <ref> [2] </ref> present a structural model of grounding based on hierarchical "contributions", however this model presents a number of difficulties for on-line processing of discourse, since the functions of a particular utterance can often only be determined after analysis of later utterances, and there is no straightforward mapping between their "acts" and <p> 2 Level Act Type Sample Acts &lt;UU Turn-taking take-turn keep-turn UU Grounding Initiate Continue Ack Repair DU Core Speech Inform YNQ Acts Accept Request &gt;DU Argumentation Elaborate Q&A Clarify Repair Table 1: Conversation Act Types Schaeffer would consider the (first utterance in the) presentation phase of a top level Contribution <ref> [2] </ref>. Continue A continuation of a previous act performed by the same speaker. Part of a separate intonation phrase, but syntactically and conceptually part of the same act. This category also includes restart-continue, which is where some part of the previous utterance is repeated before continuing on. <p> Typical cases of implicit acknowledgement are answers to questions. Acknowledgements are also referred to by some as 3 confirmations (e.g. [3]) or acceptances (e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>). We prefer the term acknowledgement as unambiguously signalling understanding, reserving the term acceptance for a higher level speech act signalling agreement with a proposed suggestion or request. Repair Changes the content of the current DU. <p> Thus, [3] can be seen as providing an account of why agents utter acknowledgements, while section 3 gives the beginnings of an account of how these utterances contribute towards mutual belief. Clark & Schaefer <ref> [2] </ref> provide a similar account of grounding to the one given here. Their account of grounding is by Contributions, which consist of a presentation part and an acceptance part, each of which may be composed of nested contributions as well.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Speech act theory has been used in AI to provide an account of how language can be used by agents to achieve communicative goals (e.g. <ref> [4; 7] </ref>). One of the main effects in most accounts of speech acts is a change in the mutual beliefs, or common ground of the agents, but most accounts of speech acts have made overly strong predictions of when mutual beliefs are expected to result.

Repairs are concerned merely with the grounding of content and not changes to previously grounded content. ReqRepair A request for repair. Asks for a repair by the other party. This is roughly equivalent to what Schegloff, et. al. term a Next Turn Repair Initiator [9].

Reference-contexts: Repairs are concerned merely with the grounding of content and not changes to previously grounded content. ReqRepair A request for repair. Asks for a repair by the other party. This is roughly equivalent to what Schegloff, et. al. term a Next Turn Repair Initiator <ref> [9] </ref>. Often a ReqRepair can be distinguished from a repair or acknowledge only by intonation. A ReqRepair invokes a discourse obligation on the listener to respond with either the requested repair, or an explicit refusal or postponement (e.g a followup request).

Reference-contexts: Often it will be seen as a request for acknowledgement by the other party, a signal that the speaker is shifting to a new topic, or a pre-closing device <ref> [10] </ref>. Similarly, a speaker cannot continue an utterance begun by another speaker.

Reference-contexts: While this is somewhat awkward using the analysis given in Section 3, the semantics makes this relationship fairly clear. We are also making attempts to implement grounding ideas in the context of the TRAINS dialogue manager <ref> [11] </ref>. In this system, the state of grounding of information is tracked using a set of belief contexts, and recognized acts will move information from one context to another.

Reference-contexts: The relationship of information in these spaces will also serve as a guide to system produced utterances (e.g. when to produce a repair or acknowledgement).

Reference-contexts: Another avenue we are pursuing is providing a formal semantics for grounding acts based on general sub-action relationships <ref> [13] </ref>. One of the difficulties with DUs and grounding acts as presented here is that the "content" of DUs is often not stipulated in advance, but negotiated between an initiator and responder.

Reference-contexts: A DU consists of a series of grounding acts performed by different conversational participants. A DU may contain one or more (partial) traditional speech acts. Table 1 summarizes the multi-level theory of conversation acts described in <ref> [14; 15] </ref>. Turn-taking acts, which coordinate who's turn it is to talk, occur within the scope of a single utterance unit. Grounding acts occur at the level of a single utterance unit, and coordinate the grounding of content.
