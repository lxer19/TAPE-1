Title: Aligning WordNet with Additional Lexical Resources

Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between Word-Net and other conventional linguistically-based lexical resources. We introduce an algorithm for aligning word senses from different resources, and use it in our experiment to sketch the role played by WordNet, as far as sense discrimination is concerned, when put in the context of other lexical databases. The results show how and where the resources systematically differ from one another with respect to the degree of polysemy, and suggest how we can (i) overcome the inadequacy of individual resources to achieve an overall balanced degree of sense discrimination, and (ii) use a combination of semantic classification schemes to enrich lexical information for NLP.

Reference-contexts: This can guide improvement of the resources. An approach to the integration problem is offered by WordNet. WordNet is designed to enable conceptual search <ref> (Miller et al., 1993) </ref>, and therefore it should provide a way of linking word level senses as those in dictionaries with semantic classes as those in thesauri. However, one important question is whether WordNet, a psycholinguistically-based resource, will work the same way as conventional linguistic resources do. <p> where we also suggest some ways to apply them. 2 Integrating Different Resources 2.1 Relations between Resources The three lexical resources we used are the 1987 revision of Roget's Thesaurus (ROGET) (Kirkpatrick, 1987), the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter, 1978) and the Prolog version of WordNet 1.5 (WN) <ref> (Miller et al., 1993) </ref>.
