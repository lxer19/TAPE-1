Abstract: Frequently, data in scientific computing is in its abstract form a finite point set in space, and it is sometimes useful or required to compute what one might call the "shape" of the set. For that purpose, this paper introduces the formal notion of the family of ff-shapes of a finite point set in IR 3 . Each shape is a well-defined polytope, derived from the Delaunay triangulation of the point set, with a parameter ff 2 IR controlling the desired level of detail. An algorithm is presented that constructs the entire family of shapes for a given set of size n in time O(n 2 ), worst case. A robust implementation of the algorithm is discussed and several applications in the area of scientific computing are mentioned. Categories and Subject Descriptors.

Reference-contexts: Upper Bounds. According to the upper bound theorem for convex polytopes, the maximum numbers of 1-, 2-, and 3-faces of a convex polytope with n 5 vertices in IR 4 are 1 2 (n 2 n), n 2 3n, 2 (n 2 3n), respectively (see for example <ref> [3, 32] </ref>). The lifting map implies the same upper bounds for jF k j, with 1 k 3.

Reference-contexts: Distribution of a Point Set. An interesting though ill-defined geometric problem arises in the study of the distribution of galaxies in our universe. As observed in studies like in <ref> [4, 19] </ref>, the galaxies are distributed in an unexpected and rather nonuniform manner (see figure 5). Astronomers have measured the location of about 170000 galaxies, each one represented by a point in three-dimensional space.

Reference-contexts: The current version of our program, however, stores the ff-spectrum using only a linear array. Recall that the ff-spectrum is the sorted sequence of ff-thresholds, and for practical reasons, the implementation adds 0 and 1 to this list. Universal hashing (see for example <ref> [5] </ref>) provides the link between the triangle structure and the array. The data structure used to store the three-dimensional triangulation is a specialized version of the edge-facet structure introduced by Dobkin and Laszlo [7]. <p> This function reflects the evolution of the number of components as ff changes continuously from 0 to +1. Given the ff-spectrum, it is fairly easy to compute c. Start at ff = 0 and maintain a union-find data structure (see for example <ref> [5] </ref>) storing the components as threshold values are processed in increasing order. A more challenging task is 27 the computation of the signatures for higher-order homology groups.

Reference-contexts: Assuming general position of the points, this triangulation is unique and decomposes the convex hull of S into tetrahedra. The triangulation is named after the Russian geometer Boris Delaunay (also Delone) who introduced it in his seminal paper <ref> [6] </ref> in 1934. As explained below, the Delaunay triangulation of S is dual to another complex defined by S known as the Voronoi diagram [41, 42]. Both complexes are related in an interesting way to the family of all ff-shapes of S. <p> This is the case iff the point p v lies outside the sphere @b T 0 . Local Delaunayhood is a necessary condition for T to belong to the Delaunay triangulation, but it is not sufficient. Nevertheless, Delaunay <ref> [6] </ref> proved that if all triangles are locally Delaunay then the triangulation is a Delaunay triangulation. The incremental-flip algorithm needs to restore Delaunayhood whenever a new point is added to the triangulation. For this, it identifies triangles that are not locally Delaunay and tries to flip them.

Reference-contexts: More recently, Veltkamp [40] also generalized the above-mentioned two-dimensional graph structures to three-dimensions, calling them fl-graphs. Finally, note the superficial similarity between ff-shapes and isosurfaces in IR 3 . The latter is a popular concept in volume visualization (see for example <ref> [8, 29] </ref>). The outline of this paper is as follows. A formal definition of ff-shapes, along with illustrations, is presented in section 2. Geometric concepts related to ff-shapes are discussed in section 3. These are ff-hulls, ff-diagrams (also known as space-filling diagrams), ff-complexes, Delaunay triangulations, and Voronoi diagrams.

Reference-contexts: First, although the upper bounds on the number of simplices of D are tight, there are many fewer simplices for most point sets. For example, if the n points are uniformly distributed in the unit ball then the expected number of simplices is only O (n) (see Dwyer <ref> [9] </ref>). Second, not all edges and triangles of D have a smallest circumsphere that bounds an empty open ball.

Reference-contexts: Through the availability of signatures of measures (see section 8), the ff-shape gives comparably efficient access to metric information over a range of detail monitored by ff. Resulting quantifications can be useful in the comparative study of the actually observed galaxy distribution and simulated data (see <ref> [10] </ref> for first steps in this direction). 23 The points are obtained from a public domain data set for modeling and rendering programs. All connectivity information (edges and triangles) is removed, and in order to generate more points, the centroids of all triangles are added.

Assuming general position of the points, this triangulation is unique and decomposes the convex hull of S into tetrahedra. The triangulation is named after the Russian geometer Boris Delaunay (also Delone) who introduced it in his seminal paper [6] in 1934. <p> Negative Alpha Values. This extension has been described in [14] for the two-dimensional case. 5 For negative ff, ff-complexes are most naturally defined as subcomplexes of the so-called furthest-point Delaunay triangulation of S (see for example <ref> [11, 35] </ref>). For T S and jT j = 4, the tetrahedron T belongs to this triangulation iff b T contains all points of S T . The ff-shape is, again, the underlying space of the ff-complex. <p> An upper bound on the number of simplices of D can be obtained using a relationship between Delaunay triangulations in IR 3 and certain convex polytopes in IR 4 . We briefly describe this relationship in the next paragraph and refer to <ref> [11, 38] </ref> for details. Lifting Map. Identify IR 3 with the x 1 x 2 x 3 -space in IR 4 , that is, the subspace x 4 = 0. <p> Otherwise, it belongs to the upper boundary of conv (S U ). If we project all facets of the lower boundary of conv (S U ) parallel to the x 4 -axis into IR 3 , along with their subfaces, then we obtain the Delaunay triangulation of S (see <ref> [11] </ref>). Upper Bounds. According to the upper bound theorem for convex polytopes, the maximum numbers of 1-, 2-, and 3-faces of a convex polytope with n 5 vertices in IR 4 are 1 2 (n 2 n), n 2 3n, 2 (n 2 3n), respectively (see for example [3, 32]). <p> For completeness, section 5.3 gives the formulas that can be used to implement the required primitive operations. 5.1 Three-dimensional Delaunay Triangulations The construction of Delaunay triangulations is a popular topic in the area of geometric algorithms (see for example <ref> [11, 35] </ref>). Indeed, various different approaches have been studied and described in the literature. Some approaches are based on the lifting map mentioned in section 4, which transforms the problem into one of constructing the convex hull of a four-dimensional point set.

Reference-contexts: In order to represent such diagrams by polytopes similar to ff-shapes it is necessary to introduce weighted ff-shapes. These can be defined using subcom-plexes of so-called regular triangulations (see for example <ref> [12, 28] </ref>). Given a finite set of points, each with a real weight, the regular triangulation is a unique simplicial complex whose underlying space is the convex hull of the point set. If all weights are the same then it equals the Delaunay triangulation of the points.

Reference-contexts: If all weights are the same then it equals the Delaunay triangulation of the points. Details can be found in <ref> [13] </ref>. Higher Dimensions. It is fairly straightforward to generalize all important concepts of this section (like ff-shapes, ff-hulls, ff-diagrams, ff-complexes, Delaunay triangulations, and Voronoi diagrams) to finite point sets S in IR d , for arbitrary dimension d. This generalization, combined with an extension to weighted points is developed in [13]. <p> <ref> [13] </ref>. Higher Dimensions.

Note however, that the implementation details become progressively "hairier" with increasing dimension, and the worst-case complexity of the problem grows exponentially. <p> If T 0 [ T 00 is convex then the triangle T can 6 As recently shown, the flip algorithm can be extended to compute regular triangulations in arbitrary dimensions [16].

Together with this edge, the triangles connecting it with the three vertices of T are added. This operation is called a triangle-to-edge flip. Otherwise, T 0 [ T 00 is not convex.

Reference-contexts: Jarvis [23] was one of the first to consider the problem of computing the shape as a generalization of the convex hull of a planar point set. A mathematically rigorous definition of shape was later introduced by Edelsbrunner, Kirkpatrick, and Seidel <ref> [14] </ref>.

Negative Alpha Values. This extension has been described in <ref> [14] </ref> for the two-dimensional case. 5 For negative ff, ff-complexes are most naturally defined as subcomplexes of the so-called furthest-point Delaunay triangulation of S (see for example [11, 35]). <p> It is therefore irrelevant whether the interval is open or closed at its left endpoint. 5 The definitions in <ref> [14] </ref> are slightly different from the ones in this paper. In particular, their ff is the same as minus one over ff in this paper.

Reference-contexts: The general-position assumption will later be extended when convenient (see section 5.3). It simplifies forthcoming definitions, discussions, and algorithms, and is justified by a programming technique known as SoS <ref> [15] </ref>. This method simulates an infinitesimal perturbation of the points on the level of geometric predicates and relieves the programmer from the otherwise necessary case analysis (see section 6.2). Formal Definition. For 0 &lt; ff &lt; 1, let an ff-ball be an open ball with radius ff. <p> We can assume that the degenerate case where p v 2 @b T does not occur. A possible implementation of this test is discussed in <ref> [15] </ref> using an extension of the lifting map (as mentioned in section 4) to three-dimensional spheres. Consider the paraboloid of revolution U : x 4 = P 3 ` in IR 4 . <p> This assumption would be too restrictive. On the other hand, in the context of three-dimensional ff-shapes, it would be rather tedious to deal with the large number of special cases in ad hoc manner. For this reason, we apply a general technique, known as Simulation of Simplicity, or SoS <ref> [15] </ref>, which acts as a black box between the implementation of a geometric algorithm and the input data. It allows a systematic treatment of all special cases on the level of geometric primitive operations. The SoS library consists of a set of carefully implemented primitives. <p> The SoS library consists of a set of carefully implemented primitives. It provides the programmer with the illusion of simple data while the actual input is in arbitrary and thus possibly degenerate position. 8 This section can only sketch the basic idea of SoS (refer to <ref> [15] </ref> for details). The idea of SoS is to perturb the given objects ever so slightly, in a manner that all degeneracies disappear. The perturbation should be small enough so that the nondegenerate position of objects relative to each other remains unchanged. <p> Some postprocessing can be used to remove or repair parts of the output that collapse to a degenerate state because of the degeneracy of the input data. This is mentioned in <ref> [15] </ref>. As an example, consider the case of Delaunay triangulations and coplanar points on the boundary of the convex hull. The perturbation will move some points towards inside and some towards outside.

Together with this edge, the triangles connecting it with the three vertices of T are added. This operation is called a triangle-to-edge flip. <p> An exception to this rule are volumetric data with points on a regular grid or parallel slices (as in the data sets grid1, ku2, rat_T2a, and hsr). The incremental-flip algorithm is certainly less than ideal for such distributions and should possibly be replaced by a randomized version (see <ref> [16] </ref>). 9 Observe the positive correlation between the number of determinant evaluations or long-integer operations and CPU seconds. Indeed, run-time profiles of the C code suggest that the majority of CPU cycles is used for the long-integer arithmetic computing determinants. <p> By randomization, one can also achieve an expected running time roughly proportional to the expected number of simplices, if an underlying distribution is assumed. This is explained in <ref> [16] </ref>. On a different level, the running time of our program can be improved by speeding up the geometric primitives which all reduce to integer computations (see section 6). According to our experimental studies, about 75% of the time is spent doing integer arithmetic.

Nevertheless, the correctness of the flip algorithm in IR 3 can be established if the points are added one by one.

Reference-contexts: In order to represent such diagrams by polytopes similar to ff-shapes it is necessary to introduce weighted ff-shapes. These can be defined using subcom-plexes of so-called regular triangulations (see for example <ref> [12, 28] </ref>). Given a finite set of points, each with a real weight, the regular triangulation is a unique simplicial complex whose underlying space is the convex hull of the point set. If all weights are the same then it equals the Delaunay triangulation of the points.

Reference-contexts: More recently, Veltkamp [40] also generalized the above-mentioned two-dimensional graph structures to three-dimensions, calling them fl-graphs. Finally, note the superficial similarity between ff-shapes and isosurfaces in IR 3 . The latter is a popular concept in volume visualization (see for example <ref> [8, 29] </ref>). The outline of this paper is as follows. A formal definition of ff-shapes, along with illustrations, is presented in section 2. Geometric concepts related to ff-shapes are discussed in section 3. These are ff-hulls, ff-diagrams (also known as space-filling diagrams), ff-complexes, Delaunay triangulations, and Voronoi diagrams.

Reference-contexts: If combined with the methods of Matousek and Schwarzkopf <ref> [30] </ref> it runs in time O (n 4=3+" + m log n) for n points in IR 3 . By randomization, one can also achieve an expected running time roughly proportional to the expected number of simplices, if an underlying distribution is assumed. This is explained in [16].

Reference-contexts: Upper Bounds. According to the upper bound theorem for convex polytopes, the maximum numbers of 1-, 2-, and 3-faces of a convex polytope with n 5 vertices in IR 4 are 1 2 (n 2 n), n 2 3n, 2 (n 2 3n), respectively (see for example <ref> [3, 32] </ref>). The lifting map implies the same upper bounds for jF k j, with 1 k 3.

Reference-contexts: the boundary of U ff , be represented by S ff , or more specifically, the faces of S ff and their incidences. 3.2 Delaunay Triangulations and Voronoi Diagrams A finite point set S IR 3 defines a special triangulation known as the Delaunay triangulation of S (see for example <ref> [11, 35] </ref>). Assuming general position of the points, this triangulation is unique and decomposes the convex hull of S into tetrahedra. The triangulation is named after the Russian geometer Boris Delaunay (also Delone) who introduced it in his seminal paper [6] in 1934. <p> Negative Alpha Values. This extension has been described in [14] for the two-dimensional case. 5 For negative ff, ff-complexes are most naturally defined as subcomplexes of the so-called furthest-point Delaunay triangulation of S (see for example <ref> [11, 35] </ref>). For T S and jT j = 4, the tetrahedron T belongs to this triangulation iff b T contains all points of S T . The ff-shape is, again, the underlying space of the ff-complex. <p> For completeness, section 5.3 gives the formulas that can be used to implement the required primitive operations. 5.1 Three-dimensional Delaunay Triangulations The construction of Delaunay triangulations is a popular topic in the area of geometric algorithms (see for example <ref> [11, 35] </ref>). Indeed, various different approaches have been studied and described in the literature. Some approaches are based on the lifting map mentioned in section 4, which transforms the problem into one of constructing the convex hull of a four-dimensional point set. <p> The other is used for the intervals assigned to the simplices of D. A triangle-based data structure is used to store D. This is briefly described in the paragraphs below. An interval tree can be used to store the collection of intervals (see for example <ref> [35] </ref>). The current version of our program, however, stores the ff-spectrum using only a linear array. Recall that the ff-spectrum is the sorted sequence of ff-thresholds, and for practical reasons, the implementation adds 0 and 1 to this list.

Reference-contexts: However, there are many more gene sequences that can be determined. One of the goals of theoretical molecular biology is to obtain three-dimensional positional information from the knowledge of these sequences. This is the problem of protein folding <ref> [20, 36] </ref>. Since the ff-shape is computationally inexpensive and because it closely reflects the physical reality of molecules, it is hoped that ff-shapes prove to be a useful tool in future protein folding research.

Reference-contexts: For example, if S is a set of n points in IR d then the Delaunay triangulation of S can consist of up to fi (n b d+1 2 c ) faces (see <ref> [38] </ref>). Although the running time of the programs constructing ff-shapes will get substantially worse as d increases, there might be applications that warrant implementations in low dimensions higher than three. 4 Because of the general-position assumption we have ff 6= % T . <p> An upper bound on the number of simplices of D can be obtained using a relationship between Delaunay triangulations in IR 3 and certain convex polytopes in IR 4 . We briefly describe this relationship in the next paragraph and refer to <ref> [11, 38] </ref> for details. Lifting Map. Identify IR 3 with the x 1 x 2 x 3 -space in IR 4 , that is, the subspace x 4 = 0. <p> As a matter of fact, the upper bound for jF 3 j is one less than for the number of 3-faces of conv (S U ) because at least one 3-face belongs to the upper boundary of conv (S U ). By a result of <ref> [38] </ref>, these bounds are tight even though the vertices of conv (S U ) are constrained to lie on a second-degree surface in IR 4 .
