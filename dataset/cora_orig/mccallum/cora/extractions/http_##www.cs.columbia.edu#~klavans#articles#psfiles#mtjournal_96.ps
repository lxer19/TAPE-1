Abstract: This paper describes and discusses some theoretical and practical problems arising from developing a system to combine the structured but incomplete information from machine readable dictionaries (MRDs) with the unstructured but more complete information available in corpora for the creation of a bilingual lexical data base, presenting a methodology to integrate information from both sources into a single lexical data structure. The bicord system (BIlingual CORpus-enhanced Dictionaries) involves linking entries in Collins English-French and French-English bilingual dictionary with a large English-French and French-English bilingual corpus. We have concentrated on the class of action verbs of movement, building on earlier work on lexical correspondences specific to this verb class between languages (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1989), (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990a), (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990b). 1 We first examine the way prototypical verbs of movement are translated in the Collins-Robert (Atkins, Duval, and Milne, 1978) bilingual dictionary, and then analyze the behavior of some of these verbs in a large bilingual corpus. We incorporate the results of linguistic research on the theory of verb types to motivate corpus analysis coupled with data from MRDs for the purpose of establishing lexical correspondences with the full range of associated translations, and with statistical data attached to the relevant nodes.

Reference-contexts: The criteria for degree of polysemy was based on dictionary structure, since it is an obvious fact that higher frequency content words tend to be the most polysemous as reflected in number of dictionary senses <ref> (Atkins, 1987) </ref>. For this reason, the set was reduced to extract a small test set of representative COMBINING CORPUS AND MACHINE-READABLE DICTIONARY 17 verbs of medium frequency since they are assumed to be of limited polysemy. For example, compare run, walk, commute, and zoom.

Reference-contexts: The bicord System Description of the Algorithm Our approach involves a combination of standard linguistic methodology using MRDs, enhanced with some statistical techniques. MRDs have served as useful resources in many natural language applications. Although they are limited in size and in internal cohesion (see <ref> (Atkins, Kegl, and Levin, 1988) </ref>), nonetheless the structure imposed by lexicographers has proven to be useful for a variety of purposes. <p> The relationship between the transitive (34) and the intransitive (36) is that of a transitivity alternation; the theme moves from surface object to surface subject position. Indications of transitivity alternations are not always clear in MRDs, as discussed in <ref> (Atkins, Kegl, and Levin, 1988) </ref> and (Neff and Boguraev, 1989).

Reference-contexts: Translations and collocations were abstracted automatically from the parsed version of D EF and D FE <ref> (Neff and Boguraev, 1989) </ref> using LQL (Neff, Byrd, and Rizk, 1988). To illustrate, Figure 5 shows a partial entry for dance from D EF , where the dots represent elided dictionary material. Translations found in D EF were `danser', `entrer/sortir etc. joyeusement', `gambader', `sautiller'. <p> The relationship between the transitive (34) and the intransitive (36) is that of a transitivity alternation; the theme moves from surface object to surface subject position. Indications of transitivity alternations are not always clear in MRDs, as discussed in (Atkins, Kegl, and Levin, 1988) and <ref> (Neff and Boguraev, 1989) </ref>. In contrast, all senses of verbs such as `gambader' to leap and `sautiller' to hop are intransitive (as determined by a look-up in D), so frequencies can be automatically placed under the associated homograph three, under the assumption that the dictionary has represented the senses accurately. <p> The definition entries are taken from the parsed version of on-line dictionaries at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center. The dictionary entry parser was written by Mary Neff with Bran Boguraev <ref> (Neff and Boguraev, 1989) </ref>. The query language was written by Roy Byrd. We are grateful to them for the use of the system and the data. We have sometimes simplified the presentation of the dictionary entries for the purpose of clarity. 3.

Reference-contexts: The corpus consists of 85 million English words (3.5 million sentences) and 97 million French words (3.7 million sentences) from the Canadian Parliamentary Proceedings (the Hansard corpus).

Table 1 gives an example of two aligned sentences. Among the information given for each file, which represents a separate session of parliament, is the following: speaker name, time, and language comments.

For example, Catizone, Russell, and Warwick (1989) take two corresponding texts (English and German) and develop algorithms to determine lexical alignments by using statistical methods over texts combined with the optional support of an MRD. <p> As for the latter application, i.e. enhancing a statistical system with data from the MRD, new approaches to self-organizing systems are beginning to take into account MRD data to set values or to alter values in computation <ref> (Brown et al., 1993) </ref>. The former application can be viewed in the light of a lexicographer's workstation; it can also be viewed as a contribution to the choice of lexical item made by the component responsible for lexical transfer in a machine translation system.

Reference-contexts: Statistical and symbolic approaches in building lexicons Combining linguistic and statistical methods is becoming increasingly common in computational linguistics, especially as more corpora become available (Klavans and Resnik, 1996). In the monolingual lexicon construction literature, e.g. (Church and Hanks, 1990), <ref> (Calzolari and Bindi, 1990) </ref>, (Brent, 1993), (Klavans and Resnik, 1996), purely statistical procedures have been shown to achieve fairly solid results. However, there is now a movement in the direction of incorporating prior linguistic knowledge for the monolingual lexicon, as discussed in (Pustejovsky, Bergler, 12 J. KLAVANS AND E.

Reference-contexts: The criteria used to ensure that a verb is a member of this semantic class were set out in Section 3, based on Cruse (1986).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the query on French motion verbs would result in a set of very general verbs, such as entrer, sortir, etc., rather than specific movement verbs such as for English gallop, limp, or zoom.

Reference-contexts: These and other patterns can be discovered by statistical analysis over tags and lexical items in the reduced probe corpora as shown in <ref> (Church et al., 1991) </ref>. Assisted by such evidence, a new set of collocations can be inserted in the lexicon; a fuller entry for dance is shown as follows in Figure 8. 6.

Reference-contexts: We take a decompositional approach to the underlying structure of movement verbs <ref> (Dowty, 1979) </ref>, (Talmy, 1985), (Cruse, 1986), (Jackendoff, 1987), (Levin and Rap-paport, 1988). Theoretically, the position is based on the claim that word meanings, i.e. the concepts that words label, are constructed from semantic components that recur in the meanings of different words. <p> Thus, words are not considered to be unanalyzed atoms but can be decomposed into a set of recurrent conceptual features. Two decompositional analyses of lexical items place particular focus on the motion concepts, <ref> (Dowty, 1979) </ref> and (Jackendoff, 1987). Without reproducing the full analyses here, Dowty (1979) proposed three aspectual operators do, become, and cause and suggests that verbs are defined from basic stative predicates in terms of these operators.

Reference-contexts: The phenomenon of incorporation in verbs of motion is well-studied in the linguistic literature, such as in (Talmy, 1985), (Jackendoff, 1987), (Levin and Rappaport, 1988), (Talmy, 1975), <ref> (Gruber, 1965) </ref>. For example, manner of motion verbs such as float are in fact ambiguous. Consider example (1) from Carter (1988): (1) The bottle will float under the bridge.

Reference-contexts: Certainly, the procedure has flaws, due to polysemy as discussed below, but it has proven quite successful. For example, Table 3 shows some examples of typical correspondences, all taken from CR, using a seed list generated automatically from the Webster's Seventh taxonym dictionary <ref> (Klavans, Chodorow, and Wacholder, 1990) </ref>. As the table shows, the list of English verbs identified by this technique is strikingly accurate. <p> The criteria used to ensure that a verb is a member of this semantic class were set out in Section 3, based on Cruse (1986).

Tagging is both a preliminary step to effective parsing, and, at the same time, is an end in itself since correct part of speech assignment is a particularly challenging problem in a morphologically limited language like English.

Reference-contexts: The tagger utilizes a set of tags, which is a reduction of the Lancaster Treebank <ref> (Leech, Garside, and Atwell, 1983) </ref> tagset. From 159 original tags from the Treebank set, 76 tags were used for the present tagger. By random sampling, the error rate for part of speech tagging was determined to be about 3%. This constitutes the first step in disambiguation, enabling lexical correspondences.

Reference-contexts: The phenomenon of incorporation in verbs of motion is well-studied in the linguistic literature, such as in (Talmy, 1985), (Jackendoff, 1987), <ref> (Levin and Rappaport, 1988) </ref>, (Talmy, 1975), (Gruber, 1965). For example, manner of motion verbs such as float are in fact ambiguous. Consider example (1) from Carter (1988): (1) The bottle will float under the bridge. <p> We take a decompositional approach to the underlying structure of movement verbs (Dowty, 1979), (Talmy, 1985), (Cruse, 1986), (Jackendoff, 1987), <ref> (Levin and Rap-paport, 1988) </ref>. Theoretically, the position is based on the claim that word meanings, i.e. the concepts that words label, are constructed from semantic components that recur in the meanings of different words. <p> An understanding of this theory has driven this research, and has enabled the structuring of lexical entries in the enhanced lexical data base. Several approaches to machine translation have built on Jackendoff's primitives, as well as on (Hale and Keyser, 1986), <ref> (Levin and Rappaport, 1988) </ref>, and others. For example, Dorr (1992) demonstrates that the decompositional approach in machine translation permits the definition of a recursive translation mapping which treats verbs and their arguments as compositional units. <p> The bicord System Description of the Algorithm Our approach involves a combination of standard linguistic methodology using MRDs, enhanced with some statistical techniques. MRDs have served as useful resources in many natural language applications. Although they are limited in size and in internal cohesion (see <ref> (Atkins, Kegl, and Levin, 1988) </ref>), nonetheless the structure imposed by lexicographers has proven to be useful for a variety of purposes. <p> The relationship between the transitive (34) and the intransitive (36) is that of a transitivity alternation; the theme moves from surface object to surface subject position. Indications of transitivity alternations are not always clear in MRDs, as discussed in <ref> (Atkins, Kegl, and Levin, 1988) </ref> and (Neff and Boguraev, 1989).

Reference-contexts: Tagger output: J* N*1 VVG1* R*R I* VVG1* 5.3.2. Tagging Text with a Statistical Tagger A statistical tagger (Tzoukermann and Merialdo, 1989) and <ref> (Merialdo, 1994) </ref>, was used to assign part of speech to the English side of the relevant corpus. In this way, words with a verbal part-of-speech were disambiguated from other parts-of-speech. The tagger used to preprocess the corpus was trained on one million words and based on a trigram model.

Reference-contexts: Translations and collocations were abstracted automatically from the parsed version of D EF and D FE <ref> (Neff and Boguraev, 1989) </ref> using LQL (Neff, Byrd, and Rizk, 1988). To illustrate, Figure 5 shows a partial entry for dance from D EF , where the dots represent elided dictionary material. Translations found in D EF were `danser', `entrer/sortir etc. joyeusement', `gambader', `sautiller'. <p> The relationship between the transitive (34) and the intransitive (36) is that of a transitivity alternation; the theme moves from surface object to surface subject position. Indications of transitivity alternations are not always clear in MRDs, as discussed in (Atkins, Kegl, and Levin, 1988) and <ref> (Neff and Boguraev, 1989) </ref>. In contrast, all senses of verbs such as `gambader' to leap and `sautiller' to hop are intransitive (as determined by a look-up in D), so frequencies can be automatically placed under the associated homograph three, under the assumption that the dictionary has represented the senses accurately. <p> The definition entries are taken from the parsed version of on-line dictionaries at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center. The dictionary entry parser was written by Mary Neff with Bran Boguraev <ref> (Neff and Boguraev, 1989) </ref>. The query language was written by Roy Byrd. We are grateful to them for the use of the system and the data. We have sometimes simplified the presentation of the dictionary entries for the purpose of clarity. 3.

Reference-contexts: There are difficulties in constructing these large lexicons, first in their design, and then in providing them with the necessary and sufficient data. This paper extends earlier work <ref> (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1989) </ref>, (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990a), (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1990b), in which we reported on a study of a selected sub-set of movement verbs in a bilingual corpus. <p> We then compared the information found in the MRD's with the information found in the bilingual corpus. For example, for verbs like commute, discussed in more detail in <ref> (Klavans and Tzoukermann, 1989) </ref>, which do not have a straightfor +-hdw: commute +-homograph j j +-senseid: 4 +-superhom j +-pos: vt +-pos: vt j +-definition +-homograph j +-synxref: COMMUTATE j +-senseid: 1a +-pos: vi j +-pos: vt +-homograph j +-definition j +-senseid: 1 j j +-defstring: to give in exchange j <p> Tagger output: J* N*1 VVG1* R*R I* VVG1* 5.3.2.
