Abstract: A multimatroid is a combinatorial structure that encompasses matroids, delta-matroids and isotropic systems. This structure has been introduced to unify a theorem of Edmonds on the coverings of a matroid by independent sets and a theorem of Jackson on the existence of pairwise compatible Euler tours in a 4-regular graph. Here we investigate some basic concepts and properties related with multimatroids: matroid orthogonality, minor operations and connectivity. Mathematical Reviews: 05B35

Reference-contexts: The integral bisubmodular functions, when they are allowed to take infinite values, have also been used by Bouchet and Cunningham <ref> [8] </ref> to study the jump systems (a generalization of delta-matroids in Z V ). The fact that R is bisubmodular can be retrieved as follows. Use Construction 2.13 to lift D into a 2-matroid Q = (U; ; r).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In a preceding paper [5] we unified a theorem of Jackson [15], on the existence of pairwise compatible Euler tours in a 4-regular graph, with a theorem of Edmonds <ref> [12] </ref>, on the minimum number of independent sets to cover the ground-set of a matroid. For this purpose we introduced a new combinatorial structure, called a multimatroid, which unifies matroids, delta-matroids and isotropic systems. We complete in the present paper and subsequent ones [6, 7] the basic properties of multimatroids. <p> A base B of Q and a subtransversal S of satisfying the equality can be efficiently computed. The theorem still holds when every skew class ! satisfies j!j = 1: then each Q j is a matroid and the statement is a theorem of Edmonds <ref> [12] </ref>. However the theorem is false when jJj = 2 and every skew class ! satisfies j!j = 2: it is shown in [5] that the parity problem for matroids can be transformed into the problem of searching for B in B (Q) maximizing jCov (B)j with these assumptions.

Reference-contexts: In Section 2 we review the results already proved in [5]. We also introduce the extended submodularity inequality, equivalent to a kind of supermodularity inequality used by Jackson [15], and we relate it with the bisubmodularity inequality introduced by Kabadi and Chandrasekaran <ref> [16] </ref>. In Section 3 we introduce an orthogonality relation between matroids, similar to the classical strong map relation, and we show that a multimatroid gives raise to orthogonal matroids. <p> This inequality has been introduced by Chandrasekaran and Kabadi <ref> [9, 16] </ref>. They proved that, for a delta-matroid D = (V; F ), the function R : 3 V ! Z, defined by R (P; Q) = max (jP " F j jQ " (V n F )j) is bisubmodular.
