Title: Grouping for Recognition

Abstract: This paper presents a new method of grouping edges in order to recognize objects. This grouping method succeeds on images of both two- and three-dimensional objects. We order groups of edges based on the likelihood that a single object produced them. This allows the recognition system to consider first the collections of edges most likely to lead to the correct recognition of objects. The grouping module estimates this likelihood using the distance that separates edges and their relative orientation. This ordering greatly reduces the amount of computation required to locate objects. Surprisingly, in some circumstances grouping can also improve the accuracy of a recognition system. We test the grouping system in two ways. First, we use it in a recognition system that handles libraries of two-dimensional, polygonal objects. Second, we show comparable performance of the grouping system on images of two- and three-dimensional objects. This demonstrates that the grouping system could produce significant improvements in the performance of a three-dimensional recognition system.

Reference-contexts: Alignment approaches work by matching a few image features to model features. Each match suggests an hypothesis about the location of the object model in the image. Some systems then perform a verification step on each hypothesis. Ayache and Faugeras <ref> [1] </ref>, Lowe [25], and Huttenlocher and Ullman [16] do this. Other systems cluster the hypotheses and pick the location of the object that the most hypotheses support. Thompson and Mundy's [34], and Tucker et. al.'s [35] systems takes this approach. <p> Both GROPER and SEARCHER accept the first matches they find that satisfy their error bounds. Many other systems do this too, since it greatly reduces computational requirements (for example, Lowe [25], Huttenlocher and Ullman [16], Ayache and Faugeras <ref> [1] </ref>, and Grimson and Lozano-Perez [11]). But this means that SEARCHER will frequently consider incorrect matches that satisfy the error bounds before finding all the correct matches.

GROPER's recognition system uses groups to index into libraries of objects. Several previous systems have also addressed this problem, including Knoll and Jain [21], Kalvin et. al.

Reference-contexts: But we first outline GROPER's recognition system to explain what tasks the grouping module must perform. GROPER begins by locating edges in an image using the Canny <ref> [5] </ref> or Marr-Hildreth [27] edge detectors, and approximating these edges with lines. Next, it finds connected, or nearly connected lines that form convex curves. Convex groups are likely to come from a single object, and provide useful primitives for further grouping. <p> If a group could match many objects, pair it with all the other groups and add each combination to the pool. Return to step six, choosing the next five groups to explore from these new ones. We have discussed grouping. Edge detection is done using the Canny <ref> [5] </ref> or Marr-Hildreth [27] edge operators. Straight line approximations to edge contours are found using a standard technique. We connect the start and end of a connected string of edge pixels with a line, then break this line at the point of maximum deviation.

Reference-contexts: Acronym [4], for example, used a model-driven approach to group edges that might be the projection of a simplified class of generalized cylinders. Mohan and Nevatia [28] group together rectangular edges in a system that performs stereo matching of images of rectangular buildings. And Grimson and Lozano-Perez <ref> [11] </ref> used a Hough transform to perform grouping based on a specific model. Model-driven approaches, however, are often limited to handling only objects composed of a specific set of primitives. <p> Or, they may save time by only looking at the pairwise consistency of matched features. Goad [10], Bolles and Cain [3], Brooks [4], Grimson and Lozano-Perez <ref> [11] </ref>, Van Hove [38] and others perform constrained search. Grouping may tell us which parts of the search tree to explore first, or allow us to prune sections of the tree in advance. <p> For more on this point and its significance, see Grimson and Lozano-Perez <ref> [11] </ref>. The parameterization GROPER uses allows it to keep track, not only of whether two image edges could match two model edges, but also, of which parts of the model edges they could match. This allows GROPER's indexing system to enforce global consistency on the matches it finds. <p> Verification uses the matches produced by indexing to find a rotation and translation that maximally aligns the model edges of a match with the image edges. GROPER does this using a technique developed by Grimson and Lozano-Perez <ref> [11] </ref>. It then looks for image edges close to the proposed location of the object model. If GROPER can in this way account for a given percentage of an object's perimeter it decides it has found the object. Deciding when to perform verification offers a trade-off between accuracy and speed. <p> Both GROPER and SEARCHER accept the first matches they find that satisfy their error bounds. Many other systems do this too, since it greatly reduces computational requirements (for example, Lowe [25], Huttenlocher and Ullman [16], Ayache and Faugeras [1], and Grimson and Lozano-Perez <ref> [11] </ref>). But this means that SEARCHER will frequently consider incorrect matches that satisfy the error bounds before finding all the correct matches. On the other 27 hand, GROPER will first find the matches that satisfy the error bounds and that also contain edges that group well together.

Reference-contexts: Past systems have used these approaches to grouping because of the speed-ups that grouping brings. Grouping becomes even more important as we address more complex domains. The recognition of non-rigid objects requires greater search than the recognition of rigid objects, as Grimson <ref> [12] </ref> and Ullman [37] discuss, and using a library of objects requires more search than looking for a single object. However, grouping need not grow any more difficult under these conditions, because a bottom-up approach, like GROPER's, does not depend on the properties of the objects sought.

Reference-contexts: Our experiments indicate that this ordering is sufficient to reduce the search for objects by several orders of magnitude. Recent results in the field of object recognition demonstrate the necessity of some type of grouping, or selection, to make the combinatorics of object recognition manageable. Grimson <ref> [13] </ref> and Grimson and Huttenlocher [14] have recently shown that in the domain of two-dimensional objects, constrained search methods, and Hough transform methods break down in cluttered scenes without some type of grouping. <p> Bolles and Cain develop hypotheses by only considering sets of matches in which all the image features are nearby. Brooks groups together edges that all appear to come from the same generalized cylinder, partly to reduce the amount of search needed. Grimson <ref> [13] </ref> has shown the importance of grouping to constrained search. He shows that the expected complexity of his system, using edges that all come from one object, is quadratic. But the complexity of recognizing objects in an unsegmented, cluttered environment is exponential in the size of the correct interpretation.

Reference-contexts: This description proves useful because it makes it easy to reason about objects in terms of their convex parts. Many natural objects have a few convex parts, and much of our perception of objects seems to occur in terms of their convex parts (see Hoffman and Richards <ref> [15] </ref>). Another way to think about types is to consider what we will call the projection of a group. Intuitively, projection refers to the area pointed to by a group of edges. More precisely, consider the following three half-planes.

Straight line approximations to edge contours are found using a standard technique. We connect the start and end of a connected string of edge pixels with a line, then break this line at the point of maximum deviation.

Reference-contexts: And these groups need only be matched with compatible groups of model features. Grouping may be either model-driven or data-driven. Acronym [4], for example, used a model-driven approach to group edges that might be the projection of a simplified class of generalized cylinders. Mohan and Nevatia <ref> [28] </ref> group together rectangular edges in a system that performs stereo matching of images of rectangular buildings. And Grimson and Lozano-Perez [11] used a Hough transform to perform grouping based on a specific model.

Reference-contexts: We connect the start and end of a connected string of edge pixels with a line, then break this line at the point of maximum deviation. We then repeat this process recursively, until each line approximates edge contours to within two pixels (see Pavlidis and Horowitz <ref> [29] </ref> for a description of this type of algorithm). In the remainder of this section we describe GROPER's indexing and verification. 19 Indexing determines the sets of edges from modeled objects that might have produced a set of image edges.

Reference-contexts: Integral geometry tells 12 us that of all convex shapes, circles produce occlusions that maximize the expected amount of object perimeter covered up (see Santalo <ref> [30] </ref>, for example). This suggests that circles will produce an extreme case: the longest occlusions.

Reference-contexts: Zucker [44] and Dolan and Riseman [8]) also group together smooth image curves with small gaps. Other systems have found curves in the image that may be grouped together based on collinearity, (Boldt, Weiss and Riseman [2]), or cocircularity (Saund <ref> [31] </ref>). GROPER's recognition system uses groups to index into libraries of objects. Several previous systems have also addressed this problem, including Knoll and Jain [21], Kalvin et. al. [20], Turney, Mudge and Volz [36] and Wallace [39].

Reference-contexts: Wallace's indexing system closely resembles GROPER's, but does not take error or occlusion into account. Kalvin et. al.[20] have used an indexing system developed by Schwartz and Sharir <ref> [32] </ref> that handles distinctively curved, continuous sections of object contours, but does not combine information from unconnected sections of an object's perimeter.

Reference-contexts: They employ a Delauney triangulation to find these simple convex groups more efficiently. Their approach also allows different criteria than proximity to be used in determining which simple groups to find. Shashua and Ullman <ref> [33] </ref> present a system that finds curves that globally minimize a weighted sum of the total curvature of the curve and the total length of gaps in the curve.

Reference-contexts: Some systems then perform a verification step on each hypothesis. Ayache and Faugeras [1], Lowe [25], and Huttenlocher and Ullman [16] do this. Other systems cluster the hypotheses and pick the location of the object that the most hypotheses support. Thompson and Mundy's <ref> [34] </ref>, and Tucker et. al.'s [35] systems takes this approach. As previously mentioned, Lowe uses grouping to focus on only some collections of image edges, not considering others.

Reference-contexts: Past systems have used these approaches to grouping because of the speed-ups that grouping brings. Grouping becomes even more important as we address more complex domains. The recognition of non-rigid objects requires greater search than the recognition of rigid objects, as Grimson [12] and Ullman <ref> [37] </ref> discuss, and using a library of objects requires more search than looking for a single object. However, grouping need not grow any more difficult under these conditions, because a bottom-up approach, like GROPER's, does not depend on the properties of the objects sought.

Reference-contexts: Or, they may save time by only looking at the pairwise consistency of matched features. Goad [10], Bolles and Cain [3], Brooks [4], Grimson and Lozano-Perez [11], Van Hove <ref> [38] </ref> and others perform constrained search. Grouping may tell us which parts of the search tree to explore first, or allow us to prune sections of the tree in advance. For example, Grimson and Lozano-Perez cluster matches between image and model features into groups using the Hough transform.

However, we do not want indexing to miss a correct match, for then we may abandon a group that could lead to recognition. GROPER uses an indexing scheme closely related to one proposed independently by Wallace <ref> [39] </ref>. We can describe the relationship between two edges with five variables. We can then fill a five-dimensional array with the values that describe all pairs of edges in the object models in our library.

Reference-contexts: There has also been a good deal of work recently on using indexing to recognize planar or 3-D objects in 3-D scenes, including: Lamdan, Schwartz and Wolfson [23], Lamdan and Wolfson [24], Weiss [41], Forsyth et al.[9], Clemens and Jacobs [6], Jacobs [19] and Wayner <ref> [40] </ref>. 3 How GROPER performs Grouping This section describes how GROPER decides on the likelihood of a particular group of edges coming from a single object. But we first outline GROPER's recognition system to explain what tasks the grouping module must perform.

Reference-contexts: These curves will tend to be smooth, and may contain gaps. A Bayesian approach is used to find the curves that are likeliest to be the noisy images of smooth, connected curves in the scene. Zucker <ref> [44] </ref> and Dolan and Riseman [8]) also group together smooth image curves with small gaps. Other systems have found curves in the image that may be grouped together based on collinearity, (Boldt, Weiss and Riseman [2]), or cocircularity (Saund [31]).
