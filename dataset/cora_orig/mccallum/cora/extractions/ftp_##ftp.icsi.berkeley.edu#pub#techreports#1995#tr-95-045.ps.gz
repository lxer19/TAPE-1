Title: Random Walks on Colored Graphs: Analysis and Applications  
Author: Diane Hernek 
Date: August 1995  
Pubnum: TR-95-045  
Abstract: This thesis introduces a model of a random walk on a colored undirected graph. Such a graph has a single vertex set and k distinct sets of edges, each of which has a color. A particle begins at a designated starting vertex and an infinite color sequence C is specified. At time t the particle traverses an edge chosen uniformly at random from those edges of color C t incident to the current vertex. The first part of this thesis addresses the extent to which an adversary, by choosing the color sequence, can affect the behavior of the random walk. In particular, we consider graphs that are covered with probability one on all infinite sequences, and study their expected cover time in the worst case over all color sequences and starting vertices. We prove tight doubly exponential upper and lower bounds for graphs with three or more colors, and exponential bounds for the special case of two-colored graphs. We obtain stronger bounds in several interesting special cases, including random and repeated sequences. These examples have applications to understanding how the entries of the stationary distributions of ergodic Markov chains scale under various elementary operations.

Reference-contexts: In general, the output of the channel is a function of the input to the channel, the state of the channel at the time of transmission and random noise. This model of a finite-state channel was formalized by Blackwell, Breiman and Thomasian <ref> [5] </ref>. Formally, a finite-state channel is defined by a source and a channel. <p> This is called decoding. The probability that the receiver decodes incorrectly is at most *. Shannon's coding theorem states that it is possible to transmit information with arbitrarily small (but positive) error probability at any rate less than the channel capacity but at no greater rate. In <ref> [5] </ref> Blackwell, Breiman and Thomasian give a proof of Shannon's theorem for finite-state indecomposable channels.

APPLICATIONS 44 possible to transmit at any rate less than the capacity of the channel but not at any greater rate. To verify that this result is valid for a particular finite-state channel we must know that the channel is indecomposable. <p> To verify that this result is valid for a particular finite-state channel we must know that the channel is indecomposable. Towards this end the authors give the following necessary and sufficient condition for channel indecomposability. Theorem 5.2 (Blackwell, Breiman and Thomasian <ref> [5] </ref>) A channel C 1 ; : : : ; C A is indecomposable if and only if every finite word C i 1 C i k is an indecomposable stochastic matrix, where k = 1; 2; : : : and i j 2 [A]. 5.3 Complexity Results In this section

Reference-contexts: Two-colored directed graphs were first studied by Condon and Lipton <ref> [10] </ref> in their investigation of one-way interactive proof systems with space-bounded verifiers. In an interactive proof system a prover P wishes to convince a verifier V that a given shared input string x is a member of some language L. <p> In Chapter 4 we further the study of one-way interactive proof systems with logspace verifiers by showing that every language in PSPACE, the class of languages recognized by polynomial space-bounded Turing machines, has a one-way interactive proof system with a logspace verifier. In <ref> [10] </ref> the authors show that the question of whether a logspace verifier V accepts or rejects its input corresponds to a reachability question in an appropriately defined two-colored directed graph. We use this correspondence in conjunction with the PSPACE result to prove PSPACE-completeness results for connectivity problems for colored graphs. <p> CHAPTER 2. COVER TIME 17 The doubly exponential lower bound for graphs with three or more colors is a consequence of Lemma 2.5 and the following theorem: Theorem 2.4 (Condon and Lipton <ref> [10] </ref>) There are two-colored directed graphs that can be covered from all vertices and have expected cover time 2 2 W (n) . <p> product or weighted average of random walks on graphs to contain exponentially small entries, even though all entries of the stationary distributions of the original random walks are inversely polynomial. 26 Chapter 4 Colored Graphs and Complexity Classes 4.1 Introduction Two-colored directed graphs were first studied by Condon and Lipton <ref> [10] </ref> in their investigation of the power of interactive proof systems with space-bounded verifiers.

Reference-contexts: COLORED GRAPHS AND COMPLEXITY CLASSES 27 will be interested in systems where V uses space O (log n). We will use the term IP 1 (SPACE (log n)) to denote the class of languages with one-way interactive proofs with logspace verifiers. Related systems have also been studied in <ref> [13] </ref>. Since the system is one-way we can think of the prover as being represented by a proof string and the verifier as having one-way read-only access to the proof. As we will see, colored graphs are closely related to the class IP 1 (SPACE (log n)).

Reference-contexts: We will show that, for 2 i n 1, p (i; i 1) exceeds p (i; i + 1) by a constant factor. Hence, the walk is biased backwards by a constant, and it is a routine calculation (see, for example, <ref> [15] </ref>) to show that the expected time to reach vertex n is exponential in n. Let P + i be the set of primitive paths from i to i + 1, and let P i be the set of primitive paths from i to i 1.

Reference-contexts: Even this exponential time algorithm is impractical for modest values of n. Several authors worked on improving Thomasian's procedure by reducing the length of the words that are examined.

Reference-contexts: We will use the fact that STRONG CONNECTIVITY (i.e., given a directed graph G, is G strongly connected?) is complete for NL. The proof of this is a straightforward reduction from s-t CONNECTIVITY and can be found as an exercise Hopcroft and Ullmans' book <ref> [17] </ref> on the theory of computation.

So for t = n 4 , the pointwise distance kv t k is at most e n . Since each (i) is at least 1=n 2 , v t (i) is at least 1=cn 2 for all i, where c is a positive constant.

In a subsequent paper, however, Paz <ref> [21] </ref> showed that even when scrambling matrices are discarded, Thomasian's procedure could be made to examine words of length as large as 2 n 2 n .

Reference-contexts: That is, for every pair of vertices u and v, v is reachable from u and u is reachable from v. In this case M contains one communicating class of indices. Following Seneta <ref> [22] </ref> we will call such an ergodic Markov chain regular. In a regular Markov chain all entries in the stationary distribution are strictly positive. A random walk on a connected undirected nonbipartite graph G = (V; E) forms a regular Markov chain.

APPLICATIONS 41 The rate at which rate information is produced by the source M is defined using entropy. Entropy was defined by Shannon in his original 1948 paper <ref> [24] </ref>. The entropy of a discrete random variable X which takes on value x 2 X with probability p (x) is defined to be: H (X ) = x Intuitively, H (X ) measures the amount of uncertainty in the random variable X . <p> This means that typical sequences of length N can be represented using approximately N H (M) bits. Hence, the entropy rate is a measure of the average number of bits of information produced by M per unit of time.
