Reference-contexts: This form is perhaps more desirable for small webs. 1.4 Generating HTML Nikos Drakos' L A T E X2HTML Version 0.5.3 <ref> [1] </ref> can be used to translate L A T E X with embedded HTML scraps into HTML. Be sure to include the document-style option html so that L A T E X will understand the hypertext commands.

Reference-contexts: Introduction In 1984, Knuth introduced the idea of literate programming and described a pair of tools to support the practise <ref> [2] </ref>. His approach was to combine Pascal code with T E X documentation to produce a new language, WEB, that offered programmers a superior approach to programming. He wrote several programs in WEB, including weave and tangle, the programs used to support literate programming.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, all of the code sections were automatically pretty printed, resulting in a quite impressive document. Knuth also wrote the programs for T E X and METAFONT entirely in WEB, eventually publishing them in book form <ref> [4, 3] </ref>. These are probably the largest programs ever published in a readable form. Inspired by Knuth's example, many people have experimented with WEB. Some people have even built web-like tools for their own favorite combinations of programming language and typesetting language.

Reference-contexts: He wrote several programs in WEB, including weave and tangle, the programs used to support literate programming. The idea was that a programmer wrote one document, the web file, that combined documentation (written in T E X <ref> [5] </ref>) with code (written in Pascal). Running tangle on the web file would produce a complete Pascal program, ready for compilation by an ordinary Pascal compiler.

Reference-contexts: Inspired by the versatility of FunnelWeb and by the daunting size of its documentation, I decided to write my own, very simple, tool for literate programming. 1 1.1 Nuweb Nuweb works with any programming language and L A T E X <ref> [6] </ref>. I wanted to use L A T E X because it supports a multi-level sectioning scheme and has facilities for drawing figures.

Reference-contexts: Inspired by Knuth's example, many people have experimented with WEB. Some people have even built web-like tools for their own favorite combinations of programming language and typesetting language. For example, CWEB, Knuth's current system of choice, works with a combination of C (or C++) and T E X <ref> [7] </ref>. Another system, FunnelWeb, is independent of any programming language and only mildly dependent on T E X [9].

Reference-contexts: Since we want to use any language, we've got to abandon this feature. 1 There is another system similar to mine, written by Norman Ramsey, called noweb <ref> [8] </ref>. It perhaps suffers from being overly Unix-dependent and requiring several programs to use. On the other hand, its command syntax is very nice.
