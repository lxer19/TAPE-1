Reference-contexts: Evidence from animal studies has shown that some neurons in auditory cortex respond preferentially to frequency sweeps at different rates across their receptive fields (Whitfield and Evans, 1965; Suga, 1990), while others respond to particular sequential patterns (Margoliash, 1983) or species-specific calls <ref> (Aitkin, 1990) </ref>. In songbirds many neurons in the brain are very sensitive to ordered subsets of individual components of birdsong (Margoliash, 1983). After maturation, individual neurons exhibit selectivity for artificial song-like subsequences that are frequently heard during early development.

Reference-contexts: Then we describe two models developed in our lab that will together form the backbone of a general auditory pattern processing system. The first is the Lexin model for recognition of complex sequences <ref> (Anderson, 1994) </ref> and the second is a framework for design of adaptive oscillators (McAuley, 1994a) that will serve as 4 a component of a more general model for recognition of periodic patterns of many kinds. 2 Temporal Aspects of Auditory Cognition Our focus in this section is on the kind of <p> In fact, it is unlikely that the perception of sequential auditory patterns is directly tutored by and external agent. We propose a refinement and extension of the network model of auditory motion detection described in Anderson <ref> (Anderson, 1994) </ref> to general sequence identification. <p> These conditions define a three-dimensional having infinite extent (see <ref> (Anderson, 1994) </ref> for details). The final choice of model parameters depends on the rate at which competition is to occur. 22 4.1.2 Adaptation The model adapts to its environment by adjusting connection weights.

Reference-contexts: What are the general properties of an acoustic environment? First, since sound waves interact as a three-dimensional linear system, the sound generated by independent events occurring in different places are simply superimposed on each other. Thus, separating independent sound sources is a major problem <ref> (Bregman, 1990) </ref>. In our research thus far, we have developed a fairly robust sequence detecting system that can adapt itself to an simple auditory environment, that is to a field of competing sounds plus white noise.

Reference-contexts: The final choice of model parameters depends on the rate at which competition is to occur. 22 4.1.2 Adaptation The model adapts to its environment by adjusting connection weights. The adaptation of excitatory connection strengths is based on competitive learning as developed in <ref> (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1987) </ref> and modified by (Marshall, 1990). _w + j (t)[(E w + ij l6=i The network learns on each simulation step.

Reference-contexts: No features per se are recognized, although as the network predicts the next input an implicit pattern recognition occurs. It has also been shown that the decay mechanism can add contextual sensitivity to Kohonen's (1984) pattern associator <ref> (Chappell and Taylor, 1993) </ref>. Other Approaches. Several other authors have employed memory local to particular units (Anderson et al., 1988; Watrous et al., 1990; Kurogi, 1991) that retain an exponential trace of previous stimulation.

Reference-contexts: When I j = 0 for all j, the network settles to an equilibrium value of ~x = 0. If the lateral excitatory connections are ignored, and the matrix of inhibitory connections is symmetric, then the network converges to its equilibrium <ref> (Cohen and Grossberg, 1983) </ref>. Unless properly chosen non-zero lateral excitatory connections will introduce positive feedback that can cause many units in the network to permanently saturate. In practice this does not occur because input units exhibit phasic response.

Reference-contexts: Individual units in these networks function discretely and do not retain vestiges of previous activation; memory is principally maintained by network state (Elman, 1990). These states may correspond to equilibria of the system, but they are in general extremely difficult to characterize <ref> (Cummins et al., 1993) </ref>. Many of these representations are highly dependent on the set of target input sequences and do not generalize, as one might expect, to similar non-target patterns. 17 Memory based on network state works by interleaving processing with memory.

Reference-contexts: Dehaene's Model. A simple example of state memory is provided by a network composed of linked synaptic triads <ref> (Dehaene et al., 1987) </ref>. A synaptic triad consists of three units: unit A causes postsynaptic unit B to fire, just in case unit C has recently fired. If unit C is stimulated prior to unit A, then unit B will fire. <p> The storage, perception, and reproduction of sequential patterns has been studied by several researchers (Dehaene et al., 1987; Kurogi, 1987; Kleinfeld and Sompolinsky, 1988; Wang and Arbib, 1990; Reiss and Taylor, 1991). Except for <ref> (Dehaene et al., 1987) </ref>, few 19 models have been offered to explain the self-organization of sequence processing. In fact, it is unlikely that the perception of sequential auditory patterns is directly tutored by and external agent.

Reference-contexts: This can be equivalent to a simple exponential trace memory (Zipser, 1991), a dynamic remapping of the input sequence (Kleinfeld and Sompolinsky, 1988), or a state arrived at only after the network makes a 16 particular set of transitions <ref> (Elman, 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Many researchers have studied highly recurrent connectionist networks trained using supervised gradient descent (Jordan, 1986; Port and Anderson, 1989; Elman, 1990; Robinson and Fallside, 1991). Individual units in these networks function discretely and do not retain vestiges of previous activation; memory is principally maintained by network state <ref> (Elman, 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The push-and-pull of decay and synchronization maintain the model's "sense" of the psychological present <ref> (Fraisse, 1963) </ref>. That is, it is easy for the model to adapt to tempos that are around the preferred rate, but increasingly difficult for the model to adapt to tempos that become significantly slower, for example. 31 400 msec and has a duration equal to the sampling period.

Reference-contexts: That is, any auditory system must differentiate some set of spectral shapes (that is, do some form of frequency analysis and note differences in the spectrum. We imagine these features as including simple spectral `peaks' regions of relatively greater energy or as level-independent `spectral profiles' <ref> (Green, 1976) </ref>, etc. Methods for extraction of such spectral descriptions using neurally plausible mechanisms are well known (Grossberg, 1976).

Then, given some instantaneous spectral primitives, we find it helpful to classify auditory information into three types according to the temporal pattern structure that is of ecological relevance (see Figure 1): Acoustic Motions, Rhythms and Sequences.

Reference-contexts: In a more complete system, oscillators would have lateral connectivity and would develop sensitivity to metrical structure as the result of two interactive learning procedures: a gradient descent entrainment process (as discussed in the previous section) and a Hebbian learning process for adjusting lateral connection strengths <ref> (Hebb, 1949) </ref>. By definition, Hebbian learning would reinforce the connections between the oscillators entrained to the beat-level pattern and the measure-level pattern each time the ensemble `fires' in-phase (once every two beats for a duple pattern).

Reference-contexts: If networks are to address sequential patterns, there are three temporal tasks a network might be trained to perform: sequence recognition, sequence reproduction, and temporal association <ref> (Hertz et al., 1991) </ref>. For the reproduction of a sequence, the network is required to finish a partially presented sequential pattern. Sequence recognition requires the network to generate a response to a sequential pattern. The response itself may not be sequential. <p> Units that recognize patterns receive their own feedback in addition to the delayed input, making this a hybrid approach that uses both direct and transformed inputs. Networks that use this delay mechanism are less sensitive to minor sequence distortions, and thus solve much of the clocking problem discussed above <ref> (Hertz et al., 1991) </ref>. On the other hand, exponential decay of raw inputs does not provide a very reliable memory for past. 14 Wang and Arbib Model.

Reference-contexts: With decay, the oscillation period will gradually return to the oscillators preferred period. Thus, adaptive oscillators embody a temporal expectation for a continuing pattern of input pulses, which is similar to the notion of "pulses of attention" described by <ref> (Jones, 1976) </ref>. 35 5.3 Simulation 1: Adaptive Oscillator Dynamics The first simulation explored how well each oscillator entrained to input patterns with a constant drum-pulse amplitude (see Figure 10A). To be able to compare across models, all shared parameters were fixed at the same values.

Reference-contexts: The state of the network, defined at each point in time by its vector of activations, can be sufficiently unique to be associated with a particular sequence of inputs.

Reference-contexts: These systems are self-organizing and thus their abilities arise without being dictated or reinforced by an external agent. The important effect of long-term auditory experience on auditory learning has also been established by auditory developmental (Gottlieb, 1975; Moore et al., 1989) and psychophysical studies <ref> (Leek and Watson, 1984) </ref>. The storage, perception, and reproduction of sequential patterns has been studied by several researchers (Dehaene et al., 1987; Kurogi, 1987; Kleinfeld and Sompolinsky, 1988; Wang and Arbib, 1990; Reiss and Taylor, 1991).

Reference-contexts: Evidence from animal studies has shown that some neurons in auditory cortex respond preferentially to frequency sweeps at different rates across their receptive fields (Whitfield and Evans, 1965; Suga, 1990), while others respond to particular sequential patterns <ref> (Margoliash, 1983) </ref> or species-specific calls (Aitkin, 1990).

In songbirds many neurons in the brain are very sensitive to ordered subsets of individual components of birdsong (Margoliash, 1983). After maturation, individual neurons exhibit selectivity for artificial song-like subsequences that are frequently heard during early development. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that neural mechanisms underlying feature discovery are plastic and develop under the influence of environmental pressures. <p> Recent work has shown how the learning of inhibitory connections to short-term memory can enhance unit selectivity. These connections also mediate inibitory response to disordered sequences and superfluous tones like that found in the avian neural response to mal-formed birdsong fragments <ref> (Margoliash, 1983) </ref>. Altogether, this model demonstrated quite robust performance on complex nonspeech sound patterns even under severe signal/noise ratios.

Reference-contexts: Mozer points out that a huge variety of forms of memory can be formally realized via the convolution of the vectors to be remembered with an arbitrary kernel function c i (t) x i (t) = t=1 where the x (t ) are the input vectors to be remembered <ref> (Mozer, 1993) </ref>. This formulation 11 isolates the mechanism that links time steps, and accommodates delay-line memory as well as a memory composed of exponentially decaying unit activations. The recursive update equations for unit activations combine time delays and self-recurrent terms.

Reference-contexts: As afferent signals travel from the ear through the midbrain to the cortex, we find that successively higher levels show sensitivity to more and more complex stimuli that represent stimulus temporal variation with less fidelity <ref> (Schreiner and Langner, 1988) </ref>. As a consequence, neurons in auditory cortex are tuned to abstract features of the signal that are extremely difficult to define.

Reference-contexts: This requires detection of some prominent event (eg, a spectral peak) and then detection of a local change. The mechanisms for detecting spectral change are not especially difficult to design <ref> (Smythe, 1988) </ref> and neural circuits capable of picking up this information have been discovered in the sensory systems of many animals including humans.

Reference-contexts: The state of the network, defined at each point in time by its vector of activations, can be sufficiently unique to be associated with a particular sequence of inputs. This can be equivalent to a simple exponential trace memory <ref> (Zipser, 1991) </ref>, a dynamic remapping of the input sequence (Kleinfeld and Sompolinsky, 1988), or a state arrived at only after the network makes a 16 particular set of transitions (Elman, 1989).
