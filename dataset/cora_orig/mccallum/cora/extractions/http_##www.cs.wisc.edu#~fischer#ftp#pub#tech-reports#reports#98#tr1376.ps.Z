Abstract: The Web today is essentially a collection of HTML objects, and the primary mode of querying is through HTML links. However, large data collections|not just individual HTML pages or objects|are becoming increasingly accessible over the Web, and traversing HTML links is inadequate as a retrieval and query mechanism. We argue that our model of the Web must change fundamentally to support a collection of tables instead of just a collection of HTML objects in order to handle large data collections. This model is a natural extension of distributed relational databases, but with quantum shifts in the degree of autonomy and number of nodes. Supporting this model offers numerous challenges for the database research community. As networks become the backbone of information exchange, how we meet these challenges can determine whether database technology continues to be an integral part of information management or becomes "roadkill on the information superhighway." In this paper, we argue the importance of supporting tables on the Web in order to deal with data collections, and outline the new challenges that this goal raises. In particular, we discuss the following issues and how they are affected by the new environment: (1) Creating and managing integrated data repositories and sharing collections across an organization, (2) Query optimization and execution. We also propose a novel Publish-Register-Subscribe framework as a solution to one of the problems that we identify, namely data integration on the Web: (1) Consumers can publish container descriptions for desired data, and search for and register into existing containers, (2) Producers can publish descriptions of data sources, and register their sources into published containers. In this approach, the task of creating a complex network of information is gracefully distributed by enabling each producer to contribute to one or more containers without knowledge of other sources of data.

Reference-contexts: We believe that the only viable approach to querying data collections on the Web is to model each collection as a set of tables, and to view the Web itself as a loosely federated distributed database. Emerging standards such as OLE-DB <ref> [B96] </ref> already aim to support tabular interfaces to data sources such as spreadsheets. An objection to this approach might be that it does not encompass collections of non-tabular data, such as multimedia repositories. We claim that in fact such repositories must be queried using associated tabular "metadata".

Reference-contexts: Thus, existing applications can run unchanged, and the data is not imported into a DBMS. However, there is now an alternative way to get at the data, through our software's query interface. Such a remote wrapper package has been implemented in the DEVise system <ref> [LR+97] </ref>, and runs as a CGI at a remote site, The interface is as follows: It accepts an ASCII query string and parameters that indicate whether the query is to be executed or profiled. <p> Conversely, presentations of tabular information must be accessible through standard Internet browsers. These challenges argue for a new generation of presentation and retrieval tools that combine features of relational query interfaces and Internet browsers <ref> [LR+97] </ref>, and developing such tools is a major challenge. 6.8 Agent Based Architecture To realize the Gestalt framework, an agent based architecture seems necessary in order to decentralize the decision making. We briefly outline such an architecture: * Consumer Agents: These agents are associated with clients or users.

[Alb96]. <p> It is in this context that we now briefly discuss software that "wraps" a tabular data source, i.e., provides external access through a uniform interface. This is an area where there is considerable ongoing activity (see, e.g., <ref> [STR97] </ref>), and we make just two comments: (1) It is important to provide an interface to ask about estimated costs for a query, user/data profiles, etc., in order to enable intelligent query optimization.

Reference-contexts: In order to meet the challenges of querying tables over the Web, DBMSs must be brought "out of their boxes" <ref> [SZ98] </ref> and made accessible over the Web in ways that go well beyond simply providing (form-based or SQL-based) gateways to conventional DBMSs.

Reference-contexts: Tsimmis is studying an integration approach based on warehousing, rather than on-demand query evaluation. Our work in Rodin explored the use of explanations and semantic integration [MIR94, MIR93, JA97, explain] of tabular data. Finally, the Mariposa project <ref> [Sto96] </ref> at Berkeley, while not addressing integration, is investigating distributed query optimization in a dynamic environment like the Web, where the set of data sources and their capabilities are changing constantly.

Reference-contexts: Like us, these projects follow the mediation philosophy of wrapping data sources and providing mediated access through an integration agent <ref> [Wie89, Wie90] </ref>. Garlic and Hermes have objectives similar to ours, but there are many differences in the approach taken; specifically, we emphasize integrated queries spanning large numbers of networked sources. Hermes has not emphasised query optimization issues.

Reference-contexts: These differences are crucial to success in the Web environment, with large numbers of autonomous, dynamically evolving data sources.
