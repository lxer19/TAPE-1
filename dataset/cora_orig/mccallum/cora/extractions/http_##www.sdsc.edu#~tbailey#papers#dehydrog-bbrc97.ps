Reference-contexts: The usual approach for identifying distantly related homologs is to search a database with a sequence using FASTA <ref> [4] </ref> or BLAST [5]. However, as databases increase in size, such searches tend to miss the more distantly related homologs because of the noise from unrelated proteins having a random similarity to the sequence being searched.

Reference-contexts: Sensitivity can be increased by using the information from several homologous proteins to construct a composite of conserved regions for database searching <ref> [6, 7, 8] </ref>. In this approach, homologous sequences are aligned, conserved motifs are identified and an amino acid profile or log-odds matrix for each motif is calculated. <p> The model is linear, and each hidden state in the model corresponds to one or more adjacent amino acids in the protein family being modeled. In a Meta-MEME hidden Markov model, motif regions are modeled without insert states, so the motifs are similar to gapless profiles <ref> [6] </ref>. Spacer regions between motifs can be of variable length. The six strongest motifs in the set of thirty-seven divergent dehydrogenase sequences are determined using MEME 2.0.

Reference-contexts: To address these problems, we have developed an automated method for constructing motifs called Multiple Expectation-maximization for Motif Elicitation (MEME) <ref> [9, 10] </ref>.

The training set consists of the thirty-seven sequences shown in Table 1 with their SWISSPROT codes. Pairwise alignments of almost all of these sequences are less than 30% identical after using gaps and insertions to maximize identities [17, 22, 23].

Reference-contexts: This template provides the framework for a motif-based hidden Markov model incorporating all six motifs. Because the hidden Markov model is linear, it takes into account the canonical order and spacing of the motifs. The motif-based hidden Markov model is used by a modified Smith-Waterman algorithm <ref> [25] </ref> to search Genpept96 for homologs. The output score for each sequence is expressed in bits (i.e., log 2 ).

Reference-contexts: This is consistent with an absence of extra loops in these proteins and a common 3D structure. An interesting exception is carbonyl reductase, in which the six motifs span 228 residues due to an insertion of 41 residues between motifs 4 and 2 <ref> [41] </ref>. This insertion does not compromise the analysis. Meta-MEME output is useful in identifying the region where a distantly homologous protein has diverged from the dataset. For example, Drosophila immigrans alcohol dehydrogenase has a score of 90.6 bits based on residues 14-85 of the template. <p> We show some high scoring sequences that contain all 85 residues in the six motifs. In 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, these map to residues 8-188 with a score of 178.7. In carbonyl reductase <ref> [41] </ref>, these map to residues 8-235 with a ascore of 127.7. Motif residues 14-82 map to residues 86-188 on Drosophila immigrans alcohol dehydrogenase with a score of 90.6.

Reference-contexts: Comparisons of protein 3D structures is the most sensitive method for determining homology <ref> [50] </ref>, which we propose explains the excellent ability of HMM to separate homologs from noise as seen in Figure 3. In summary, the combination of HMM and MEME into the Meta-MEME tool provides a sensitive and selective method for homology searches to identify distantly related proteins.
