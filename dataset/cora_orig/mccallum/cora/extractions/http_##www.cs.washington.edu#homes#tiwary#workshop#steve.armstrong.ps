Abstract: This paper considers organisations and their information systems in the context of change. Flexibility is the dominant concept which is driving the need for change, as organisations seek to match their internal and information system structures. The global context for these new organisations has seen the conjunction of object orientation and distributed processing to enable the construction and operation of large, complex software systems. The concepts of change and flexibility will affect the frameworks needed to achieve interoperation on a large scale.
