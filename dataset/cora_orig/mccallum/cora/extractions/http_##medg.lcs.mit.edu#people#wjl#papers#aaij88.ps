Abstract: This paper relates our experience in developing a mechanism for reasoning about the differential diagnosis of cases involving the symptoms of heart failure using a causal model of the cardiovascular hemodynamics with probabilities relating cause to effect. Since the problem requires the determination of causal mechanism as well as primary cause, the model has many intermediate nodes as well as causal circularities requiring a heuristic approach to evaluating probabilities. The method we have developed builds hypotheses incrementally by adding the highest probability path to each finding to the hypothesis. With a number of enhancements and computational tactics, this method has proven effective for generating good hypotheses for typical cases in less than a minute.

Reference-contexts: For example, a myocardial infarction (heart attack) can produce both diastolic (ventricular filling) and systolic (ventricular emptying) dysfunction, each of which has different implications for therapy. To make such distinctions, a simple associational scheme such as those used by DXplain <ref> [Barnett87] </ref>, or QMR [First85] would not be sufficient. 4 Differential Diagnosis While the goal of diagnosis is to determine the pathophysiology in sufficient detail to suggest a rational approach to therapy, this goal usually can not be achieved from the initial history, presenting complaints, and physical examination.

Even if we removed all of the forward cycles, there are still multiple paths between nodes.

Reference-contexts: These are not forbidden in Bayesian belief networks, but they greatly increase 11 the amount of computation required to compute the probabilities.

We did an analysis of an earlier version of the model and determined that to use the method described by Pearl [Pearl86] and interpolate from a set of nodes whose values cut the multiple paths would require more than 40 nodes in the cut set.

Reference-contexts: These are all produced by fluid buildup in the lungs, so an intermediate node was added for pulmonary congestion. Identifying intermediate nodes was not done blindly. We started with the model used in the program to predict the effects of therapy <ref> [Long88] </ref>. This model has equations relating the constraints among parameters and dependencies on physiologic state. Since diagnosis of the patient provides much of the information needed to establish the pathophysiologic state for this model, the intermediate nodes must be compatible.

Reference-contexts: The network is the knowledge base from which diagnostic reasoning is done. 7 Computing the Differential Diagnosis The knowledge base, with its binary nodes and probabilities, resembles a Bayesian belief network as defined by Pearl <ref> [Pearl86] </ref>. Such networks have been the subject of considerable research by Pearl, Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter [Lauritzen88], Cooper [Cooper86], and others. However, the network of our model does not conform to the definition of a Bayesian belief network because it has forward cycles. <p> The algorithms that have been developed to handle multiple paths are exponential and Cooper has shown that the problem is NP-hard [Cooper87]. We did an analysis of an earlier version of the model and determined that to use the method described by Pearl <ref> [Pearl86] </ref> and interpolate from a set of nodes whose values cut the multiple paths would require more than 40 nodes in the cut set. Since the probabilities in the network for all combinations of values of this set would have to be evaluated, an exact solution is infeasible.

Reference-contexts: At any point in the process, the differential diagnosis was the union of the possible values of the states 4 not yet known with the states known to be true. This is essentially the approach that was taken by CASNET <ref> [Weiss78] </ref> to reason from a causal network. There are two problems with this approach. First, it assumes there will always be enough evidence local to a parameter state (easily computable causes or consequences) to determine its truth, either immediately or given more test results.
