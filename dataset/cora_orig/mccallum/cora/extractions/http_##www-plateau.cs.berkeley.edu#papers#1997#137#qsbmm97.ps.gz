Note: 1.0 Introduction  
Abstract: The development of MBone videoconferencing tools has led to a large number of seminars being broadcast over the Internet. Most MBone seminars have little remote participation. One reason might be the absence of good oor control mechanisms. This paper describes a tool we developed, called the Questionboard, that implements oor control to facilitate question asking in large-scale MBone seminars. The qb protocol is described including the mechanisms used for reliable transmission of data and the oor control and crash recovery protocols. The MBone is a virtual network deployed over the Internet that supports routing of IP multicast packets [D91]. The deployment of the MBone and the development of MBone conferencing tools, such as vic [MJ95], vat [JM], ivs [TT94], sd [J], and wb [M92] have lead to a wide variety of events like seminars and conferences being multicast over the Internet. Since early 1995, we have multi-cast the Berkeley Multimedia and Graphics Seminar, a regularly scheduled weekly seminar over the open Internet [R95]. A speaker is invited to talk about her area of research. The presentation is multicast over the MBone. We produce audio and video streams and use wb to display slides. We run a second wb session called the control whiteboard, as a back channel to fix transmission errors and allow MBone participants to ask questions. The presentation is attended by Berkeley faculty and students, giving us a local audience in addition to the remote MBone audience. Local attendance ranges between 15 and 50 people. Remote attendance ranges between 10 and 200 people. Our experience with this seminar series is that while many questions are asked by the local audience, few remote participants ask

Reference-contexts: Also, since we were targeting large-scale seminars, we wanted all participants to get the data without requiring tight coupling. Using the cccp model, we wanted a best-effort-all service, which did not fit into any of the above scenarios. The simple conference control protocol (SCCP) <ref> [BO96] </ref> is designed for tightly-coupled conferences with a designated moderator who must give permission for new members to join. In addition to oor control, the protocol addresses media management, management of the set of members, and assignment of a special moderator role to one participant.

Reference-contexts: These questions are reliably propagated using an SRM style NACK suppression scheme <ref> [FJLMZ95] </ref>. Participants detect missing questions based on the global sequence space. When a missing question is detected, the participant qb multicasts a repair request to the entire group. Any member that received the data may reply by multicasting a repair message containing the requested data.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we handle oor grant information as follows. A heartbeat packet is sent out periodically containing critical state information including the oor control information and the sequence number of the last question seen. To facilitate quick repair of lost messages, we use a variable heartbeat scheme <ref> [HSC95] </ref>, in which heartbeat transmissions are clustered in the interval immediately following a data transmission rather than spreading them out evenly across the idle period between transmissions. The interval between two heartbeat packets varies from i min to i max .

Reference-contexts: The ITU T.120 family of protocols address the problem of a conference control architecture <ref> [ITU-T] </ref>. The design of these protocols require reliable communication and they do not use multicast. Thus, they are centralized protocols that do not scale; consequently they are inappropriate for the Internet MBone.
