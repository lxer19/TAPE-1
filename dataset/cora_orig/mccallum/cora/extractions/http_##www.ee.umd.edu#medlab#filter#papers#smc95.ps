Abstract: Text filtering has become increasingly important as the volume of networked information has exploded in recent years. This paper reviews recent progress in that field and reports on the development of a testbed for experimental investigation of cognitive and interactive text selection based on a history of user evaluations. An interactive filtering system model is presented and a new cognitive filtering technique which we call the Gaussian User Model is described. Because development of analytic measures of text selection effectiveness has proven intractable, we have modified the Cornell SMART text retrieval system to create a flexible text filtering testbed for experimental determination of filtering effectiveness. The paper concludes with a description of the design of this testbed system.

Reference-contexts: Thirty years of research on text retrieval, in which the objective has been to select documents from relatively static collections, has produced a number of effective content-based text selection techniques <ref> [1] </ref>. Although some implementation details will differ, similar performance can be achieved when these techniques are applied to filtering applications [12]. <p> Our experimental testbed is designed to perform side-by-side comparison of the effectiveness of competing algorithms, using similar parameters and the same test collection. 2 Text Filtering Algorithms Text retrieval approaches applicable to information filtering include boolean, vector space, probabilistic, spreading activation and natural language processing techniques <ref> [1] </ref>. In the boolean approach, queries are expressed as boolean expressions with the indexed terms as the set of terminal symbols, and an unranked set of documents which satisfy the expression is returned.

Reference-contexts: One of the most widely used similarity measures is the cosine of the angle between two vectors, computed as the inner product of two normalized vectors. LSI uses a more sophisticated approach to create the document vectors, but their similarity is computed in the same way <ref> [2] </ref>. From the complete collection of documents a term-document matrix in which each entry is some function of the number of occurrences of a specific term in a specific document is first formed. <p> For example, the interest may be specific to the location, but insensitive to the time (or specific to the time, but insensitive to the location). Since Deerwester, et. al. <ref> [2] </ref> claim that the singular vectors retained by LSI represent concepts, it seems reasonable to consider interest representations which allow greater variation in one dimension than another.

Reference-contexts: Foltz was the first to apply LSI to the text filtering problem [4]. He tried three cognitive filtering techniques on a small USENET news collection: closest match, average match, and clustering. Dumais has evaluated Foltz's average match technique in the first three Text REtrieval Conferences (TREC) <ref> [3] </ref>. In the average match technique, the vector representation of the information need is built as the mean of the concept vectors for relevant documents in the training set.

Reference-contexts: Recently reported work has led us to conclude, however, that techniques which automatically develop a user model based on both document content and a significant history of observing the user's reactions to those documents have the potential to achieve excellent performance without extensive knowledge engineering <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. For this reason, we are particularly interested in considering the interactive application of cognitive filtering techniques. 1 In order to provide a common frame of reference for evaluating cognitive filtering techniques we will adopt the following interactive filtering system model. <p> Hull has recently built on this work by applying LSI a second time to the reduced-dimensional vectors which represent relevant documents in a training collection, a technique which he calls Text-based Discriminant Analysis (TDA) <ref> [5] </ref>. His objective is to identify a small set of factors which explain the majority of the variance in the concept distribution of relevant documents. He then performs a modified version of discriminant analysis to compute the probability of relevance for newly arrived documents in the evaluation set. <p> An alternative which is practical for smaller collections in which every document can be judged, but 4 in which there may now be relatively few documents relevant to a specific interest, is the cross-validation technique used by Hull <ref> [5] </ref>. In cross-validation, a single relevant document is omitted from the training collection, the remainder of the documents (including the omitted document) are ranked, and the rank of the omitted document is recorded.

Reference-contexts: While we expect that the combination of cognitive and social filtering will often be superior to application of either technique in isolation, some small-scale experimental evaluations of social filtering have suggested that a critical mass must be reached before the benefits of this technique can be effective. <ref> [7] </ref> We believe that effective cognitive filtering provides a means to achieve this critical mass of users; thus the goal of our present research program is to experimentally evaluate the performance of cognitive filtering techniques. <p> Initially, documents may be sorted by source and/or category to facilitate browsing, or they may be initially filtered based on stereotypes [10] or the use of social filtering techniques <ref> [7, 9] </ref>. The user's response to each article is then observed and that information is used to organize the display of newly arrived texts.

Reference-contexts: To avoid confounding our training and evaluation data with incorrect inferences, we plan to rely on explicit binary ("like/hate") feedback in our experiment design and disregard documents which the user declines to score. We leave to future work the integration of less intrusive approaches based on indirect evidence <ref> [8, 11] </ref> once the effectiveness of the filtering algorithms have been demonstrated.

Yang and Chute have also recently reported similar performance with a text categorization technique <ref> [13] </ref> which they call Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF). They construct an optimal linear operator which minimizes the magnitude of the difference between the transformed document vectors and a given vector of category judgments on a training collection using only the term-document frequency matrix and a vector of relevance judgments.
