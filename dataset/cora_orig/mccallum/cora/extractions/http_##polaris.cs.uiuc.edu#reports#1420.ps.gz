Reference-contexts: However, the techniques for choosing the expansion frequencies are still rather heuristic; a more formal approach should be explored in future work. The Lanczos method must also still be extended to the multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) case. Block versions of the Lanczos method are already in existence, see <ref> [3] </ref> for example. Combining the multi-point method with implicit shifts in order to guarantee stability of the reduced order system is also a point of further research. Finally, we note that the inversion of (A s i E) is an area requiring additional work.

Reference-contexts: At the heart of the CD player is an optical unit (consisting of a laser diode, lenses, and photodectors) which is mounted on the end of a radial arm <ref> [4] </ref>. In particular, we will be interested in the relationship between the voltage applied to the magnetic lens actuator and the resulting lens position. Traditionally, the behavior of the lens position is represented by a third-order 18 K. Gallivan, E. Grimme, D. Sorensen and P. Van Dooren set of equations. <p> Traditionally, the behavior of the lens position is represented by a third-order 18 K. Gallivan, E. Grimme, D. Sorensen and P. Van Dooren set of equations. However, controllers designed from these simple, low-order systems experience difficulties when employed in newer, portable CD players <ref> [4] </ref>. To obtain a higher-order controller for the CD player, a better model of its behavior is required. Via finite element approximation, various portions of the CD player were modeled and combined to yield a system of equations of order n = 120.

Reference-contexts: Some history. The relations of the Pade approximation problem to that of Hankel matrices was already observed in the late 1800's by people like H. Hankel (1862), Modified Lanczos and Pade 3 G. F. Frobenius (1886) and T. J. Stieltjes (1894) (see <ref> [5] </ref> for more history on this). In the system theory literature the relation of partial realizations to Hankel matrices were rediscovered and extended to the multi-input multi-output case by Ho-Kalman, Youla-Tissi and Silverman, all three in 1966.

To handle this problem, existing AWE papers Modified Lanczos and Pade 13 prescribe searching the Pade table until a stable realization is located.

The following result (see <ref> [11] </ref> for a proof) states that the reduced-order model corresponding to (9.3) matches the desired moments of the original system without placing any restrictions on the invertibility of K k;k or E.

Reference-contexts: One cannot know a priori how many realizations must be generated before a stable one is acquired. Moreover, when a stable realization is determined, its size may exceed some desired value. As an alternative to searching the Pade table, <ref> [16] </ref> stabilizes a realization of specified size k by incorporating implicit restarts into the Lanczos algorithm. <p> In both cases, the complexity is again linear in k, requiring at most 3k operations per time step. If ^ A is appropriately normalized, the number of operations can be reduced to 2k for the tridiagonal representation as well. In addition, the implicitly restarted Lanczos method <ref> [16] </ref> provides the flexibility of "filtering" certain frequencies of the original circuit out of the realization. By removing undesired frequencies, one obtains an ^ A L whose eigenvalues are not too different from each other in scale. <p> Most importantly, the starting vectors do indeed satisfy (3.6) and (3.7). Note that only p additional standard Lanczos iterations are required to obtain an order k Lanczos factorization corresponding to v 1 and w 1 . Note that in <ref> [16] </ref> we use HR-steps instead of double LR-steps because these are better conditioned in general. 7 Example: The Portable CD Player The Compact Disc player is a well-known mechanism for reproducing sound from a disc. <p> Modified Lanczos and Pade 25 10 Example As a brief example of the utility of multi-point Pade approximations, we take now the 120 th order system describing the effects of a magnetic actuator on the radial tracking arm of a portable compact disc player, see <ref> [16] </ref>. <p> The multi-point approximation is stable and its impulse response recreates that of the original system with great precision. The Pade approximation about s 0 = 0 identifies those modes corresponding to the low-frequency peak but its impulse response is unstable. However, the techniques of <ref> [16] </ref> can stabilize the s 0 = 0 approximation so that the s 0 = 0 response to an impulse (which may or may not be the input of interest for a given application) follows that of the original system with great precision.

To overcome this difficulty, <ref> [22] </ref> proposes scaling the eigenvalues of A to keep the Hankel matrix nonsingular.

Reference-contexts: But regardless of how quickly k can be computed, one is certainly also interested in the correspondence between the original system fA; b; cg and the reduced-order system f ^ A; ^ b; ^cg. An important insight into this relationship comes out of <ref> [15, 31] </ref>. Theorem 1 Let the reduced-order system f ^ A; ^ b; ^cg be a restriction of the system fA; b; cg by the projector k where V k and W k are defined as in (3.6) and (3.7) respectively.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, given an arbitrary representation f ^ A; ^ b; ^cg, the transformation required 10 K. Gallivan, E. Grimme, D. Sorensen and P. Van Dooren to obtain the Jordan canonical form is oftentimes poorly conditioned <ref> [19, 32] </ref>. More specifically, computing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of an arbitrary ^ A (which is related to computing the residuals, r j , and frequencies, p j ) can be extremely sensitive. <p> With implicit restarts, the projector k is modified to ~ k = ~ W T ~ V which corresponds to the new starting vectors ~v 1 = (A p I)(A p1 I) : : :(A 1 I)v 1 (5.5) These implicit restarts (which correspond to LR-steps <ref> [32] </ref> with the tridiagonal matrix, T k ) incorporate information from higher moments into the reduced-order model. Strategies for choosing the parameters i in (5.5) can be employed to insure that this extra information stabilizes the partial realization. <p> Due to the band preserving properties of the LR-decomposition <ref> [32] </ref>, L and R are bidiag-onal. <p> Pairs of complex conjugate shifts would be handled via double LR shifts <ref> [32] </ref>. <p> In general, selecting the shifts to be the unstable eigenvalues of T k+p seems to generate well-scaled L's. However, one should be aware that a slight perturbation on a shift may be required in some cases. In practice, these LR-decompositions should be performed implicitly <ref> [32] </ref>. That is, a series of elementary transformations should be used to chase a bulge down the tridiagonal of T k .

Reference-contexts: But by either avoiding a difficulty or providing well-defined techniques for fixing it, the Lanczos method is better suited for handling the problems inherent to Pade approximation. Through Algorithm 1, the Lanczos method can be extended to treat multiple expansion frequencies. Multi-point approximation shows promise in several applications <ref> [8, 23, 33] </ref> as an approach for handling false instabilities and frequency response errors in the reduced-order model. However, the techniques for choosing the expansion frequencies are still rather heuristic; a more formal approach should be explored in future work.
