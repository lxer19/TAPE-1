Abstract: Dynomite is a portable electronic notebook for the capture and retrieval of handwritten and audio notes. The goal of Dynomite is to merge the organization, search, and data acquisition capabilities of a computer with the benefits of a paper-based notebook. Dynomite provides novel solutions in four key problem areas. First, Dynomite uses a casual, low cognitive overhead interface. Second, for content i n-dexing of notes, Dynomite uses ink properties and ke y-words. Third, to assist organization, Dynomites properties and keywords define views, presenting a subset of the notebook content that dynamically changes as users add new information. Finally, to augment handwritten notes with audio on devices with limited storage, Dynomite co n-tinuously records audio, but only permanently stores those parts highlighted by the user.

Reference-contexts: The approach taken by Dynomite is to enhance the traditional paper note-taking activity rather than define a new process as personal organizers and por table computers do. In contrast to Classroom 2000 <ref> [ 1] </ref>, which supports note-taking in a classroom lecture using previously made visual materials (view-graphs), our target is note-taking for any knowledge worker, anyplace. The design of a portable electronic notebook must address a number of issues. <p> The user sees these retrieval results as a view on the notebook, analogous to views in a database system. Users may define and revisit notebook views thereby providing a dynamic organization of the changing content of the notebook. E r-icksons Proteus laptop notebook [ 4] and Classroom 2000 <ref> [1] </ref> have keyword retrieval, but only over text-based co n-tent. Finally, Dynomite explores the use of audio to augment handwritten notes on devices with limited storage. Audio is recorded continuously and synchronized with the digital ink, but only those portions of the audio highlighted by the user are permanently stored.

Reference-contexts: However, since Dynomite is i n-tended to run on mobile devices, which do not have much storage, only those portions of the audio highlighted by the user are stored permanently. In contrast to the audio-only device of Degen et al. <ref> [3] </ref>, in which marks are created at a single point in the audio, Dynomite highlights can be created for variable length audio segments. The motivation for highlighting is the observation that users tend to manage audio by creating marks that identify important passages [16].

Our next step is to deploy a large nu m-ber of devices in the field, allowing users to accumulate and use a collection of notes. As Erickson <ref> [ 4] </ref> points out, the important question is how electronic notebooks will really be used over a long period of time.

Reference-contexts: For example, highlighting may be turned on when the notebooks owner is talking. This can be done using a speaker segmentation algorithm [17]. Research has shown that one difficulty with audio is the fact that it is not visible <ref> [ 5] </ref>. Thus, Dynomite indicates audio highlighting to the user in two ways. First, pen strokes made during highlighted audio are displayed in bold (see Fujitsu Stylistic in Figure 2).

Reference-contexts: The user can press the Extend button, to extend the length of time that the audio is highlighted, or can end the highlighting by pressing the End Mark button, or can simply let the audio highlight period run out. The Listener <ref> [ 6] </ref> system uses a different approach to allow saving of audio se g-ments from a telephone conversation. We are investigating how to automate the audio highlighting process by reco g-nizing the audio characteristics of a specific speaker or speakers.

Reference-contexts: Audio is recorded continuously and synchronized with the digital ink, but only those portions of the audio highlighted by the user are permanently stored. Users decide whether the non-highlighted audio is deleted or compressed. While Notetime <ref> [ 8] </ref>, Filochat [ 16], Coral [ 10] and others [1,14,15] record audio synchronously with handwritten notes, they do not address the audio storage issue. These four sets of features provide many of the benefits of both paper and computer note-taking systems.

Reference-contexts: The motivation for highlighting is the observation that users tend to manage audio by creating marks that identify important passages [16]. In one system <ref> [ 11] </ref> the user wrote HA (for hear audio) in the notes whenever interesting audio occurred. Our goal was to move from implicit marks about important audio passages to explicit marks that the system can understand. This has two advantages.

Reference-contexts: The interface to Dynomite is similar to a standard paper notebook. Users see a screen with the a p-pearance of a page in a traditional notebook and enter freeform handwritten notes that are stored as digital ink. The Tivoli <ref> [ 12] </ref> system is similar, in that it emulates whiteboard functionality on a Liveboard. Microsofts aha! Inkwriter [9] mimics a word-processor by reformatting ink to fit the columns of a page, and allows users to edit handwritten notes. <p> Pen strokes are entered on a page of notes and are stored in a structure which includes their timestamp and property. Pen strokes are clustered by time, so that strokes created sequentially without a pause are grouped. Several gestures are available to assist with the input, as in Tivoli <ref> [ 12] </ref>. An insertion gesture creates more space above and below the point of insertion, a delete gesture deletes the last group of strokes, and an undo gesture repeatedly reverts the last change.

Reference-contexts: Executives take notes in meetings to record action items. Although computers have proven adept at all manner of data processing, paper is still generally preferred over PDAs and portable computers for note-taking. Studying paper notebooks helped us to understand the affordances of paper <ref> [13] </ref> where freeform input, spatial layout, and even doodles (for their visual cues) are an integral part of the note-taking process. The approach taken by Dynomite is to enhance the traditional paper note-taking activity rather than define a new process as personal organizers and por table computers do.

Inkwriter [9] mimics a word-processor by reformatting ink to fit the columns of a page, and allows users to edit handwritten notes. Users of the Paper-based Audio Not e-book <ref> [14] </ref> take notes on paper placed on a digitizing tablet, thus allowing notes to be linked to recorded audio. Dynomite achieves low cognitive load by using ink without recognition during the note-taking process. However, the lack of text input exacerbates the problem of obtaining keys for indexing.

Reference-contexts: An insertion gesture creates more space above and below the point of insertion, a delete gesture deletes the last group of strokes, and an undo gesture repeatedly reverts the last change. A horizontal line gesture causes a new page of notes to be created, as in the Marquee <ref> [ 15] </ref> video annot a-tion system. Additionally, groups of strokes can be s elected and dragged to arbitrary locations on the page. Marking One of the major shortcomings of paper notebooks is the fact that locating a specific piece of information known to be in the notebook is difficult. <p> One, keywords can be selected from a list of previously entered keywords. Two, keywords can be typed using a pop-up keyboard. Three, keywords can be written in a keyword entry box and recognized using handwriting recognition software. Keyword indexing is also used in Marquee <ref> [15] </ref>. Review and Retrieval notes. The first two columns show the creation date for the note page and the date of last modification. Following the dates are icons that tell which properties are present on each page. Finally, the table shows the keywords assoc i-ated with each page.

Reference-contexts: We take a twofold approach. First, Dynomite allows users to associate properties, or data types, such as To Do or Name, with a collection of digital ink. Second, Dynomite allows the user to assign text keywords to a page of notes. While Filochat <ref> [ 16] </ref> pr o vides a notebook structure for handwritten notes, it does not address the problem of indexing and retrieval. Another problem Dynomite addresses is notebook organ i-zation. <p> Audio is recorded continuously and synchronized with the digital ink, but only those portions of the audio highlighted by the user are permanently stored. Users decide whether the non-highlighted audio is deleted or compressed. While Notetime [ 8], Filochat <ref> [ 16] </ref>, Coral [ 10] and others [1,14,15] record audio synchronously with handwritten notes, they do not address the audio storage issue. These four sets of features provide many of the benefits of both paper and computer note-taking systems. <p> In this way, users create vi r-tual notebooks presenting a subset of the notebook contents and revisit them to find the information they need. Audio Notes Although none of the people in our study used tape recor d-ers or Dictaphones, a similar study focusing on audio use in note-taking <ref> [16] </ref> showed that if audio were indexed and accessible it could enhance note-taking practices. Thus Dynomite provides a means to record audio synchronously with digital ink, and a way to manage audio storage. <p> The motivation for highlighting is the observation that users tend to manage audio by creating marks that identify important passages <ref> [16] </ref>. In one system [ 11] the user wrote HA (for hear audio) in the notes whenever interesting audio occurred. Our goal was to move from implicit marks about important audio passages to explicit marks that the system can understand. This has two advantages. <p> All questions were answered from the highlighted audio or the handwritten notes. This indicates that given a task where users can identify the important information, there is no obvious disadvantage to emplo y-ing audio highlighting. Our experience corroborated two findings from Filochat <ref> [16] </ref>. First, people appeared to be learning to take fewer handwritten notes and rely more on the audio. Second, people wanted to improve their handwritten notes afte r-wards by playing back portions of the audio.
