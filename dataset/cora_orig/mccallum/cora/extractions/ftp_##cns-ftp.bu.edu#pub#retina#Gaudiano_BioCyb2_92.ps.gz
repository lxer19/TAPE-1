Abstract: A Unified Neural Network Model of Spatio-Temporal Processing in X and Y Retinal Ganglion Cells. I: Analytical Results Abstract This article makes use of a push-pull shunting network, which was introduced in the companion article, to model certain properties of X and Y retinal ganglion cells. Input to the push-pull network is preprocessed by a nonlinear mechanism for temporal adaptation, which is ascribed here to photoreceptor dynamics. The complete circuit is used to show that a simple change in receptive field morphology within a single model equation can change the network's response characteristics to closely resemble those of either X or Y cells. Specifically, an increase in width of the receptive field center mechanism is sufficient to account for generation of on-off (Y-like) instead of null (X-like) responses to modulated gratings. In agreement with experimental data, the Y cell on-off response is independent of spatial phase. Also, the model accurately predicts that on-off responses can be observed in X cells for particular stimulus configurations. Taken together, the results show how the retina combines individually inadequate modules to efficiently handle the tasks required for accurate spatial and temporal visual information processing. The model is also able to clarify a number of controversial experimental findings on the nature of spatiotemporal visual processing in the retina.

Reference-contexts: I will summarize some of these controversial findings in the following two sections. After a brief overview of the push-pull shunting network (Fig. 1, see caption), which was introduced in the companion article <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992a) </ref>, I will show in the remainder of the article that inclusion of a nonlinear mechanism for temporal adaptation enables the push-pull network to resolve many of these controversial issues, and leads to the novel hypothesis that X and Y cells consist of a single neural mechanism acting under different <p> Is the nonlinearity of X cells related to the nonlinearity of Y cells, or is it an insignificant, unrelated phenomenon? 4 Toward a Unified Model In the remainder of this article I will summarize the properties of the push-pull shunting network, which was introduced in the companion article <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992a) </ref>, and show that when preceded by a nonlinear temporal adaptation mechanism this network can qualitatively reproduce many aspects of X and Y cell behavior, and resolve all of the controversies just outlined. <p> However, it was shown in the companion article <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992a) </ref> that the same properties that enable the shunting network to track spatial modulation also lead to poor temporal processing. The push-pull shunting network was designed to overcome this problem by preprocessing inputs through pairs of cells having opposite response polarity. <p> Space-time separable functions can be used to represent many of the stimuli used for experimental measurements, including for example sinusoidally or square-wave modulated spatial gratings, and drifting sinusoidal gratings. It was shown in the previous article <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992a) </ref> that (2) holds regardless of RF dimension (1- or 2-D) or specific choice of RF profile. <p> V S exp S with a = A + M C + M S = A + M (V C + V S ). (6) This solution shows that amplitude of modulation in response to the temporally modulated input component J (x)m (t) is independent of the steady background I <ref> (see also Fig. 9 from Gaudiano, 1992a) </ref>. It should be emphasized that the push-pull shunting network behaves as a linear time-invariant system regardless of the nature of input preprocessing. The example above assumes that the input is a perfect sinusoid in space and time only for clarity. <p> 1984; Saito, 1983), and thus suggests that the push-pull network may be a valid model for spatiotemporal responses of both X and Y cells. 6 Discrepancies in the Push-Pull Model An evaluation of the above hypothesis revealed a number of discrepancies between simulated and experimental X and Y cell data <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992a) </ref>. First of all, the push-pull network requires that inputs be bounded to a finite range, which implicitly assumes a preprocessing layer that can compress luminance signals to the retina. <p> Similarly, the thick solid lines in Fig. 4 demarcate input and response for simulated X and Y cells at zero degree relative spatial phase, and thus correspond to the simulated X and Y responses in the top row of Fig. 2b. In the companion paper <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992a) </ref>, I claimed that the transient overshoots and undershoots seen in RGCs must arise from nonlinear dynamics in the preprocessing layer. The mathematical results of this section have shown that this type of nonlinearity is also necessary to predict on-off responses.

Reference-contexts: In addition to this static, compressive nonlinearity, any transient nonlinearity could also affect X cell linear responses <ref> (Gaudiano, 1992b) </ref>. For instance, it is known that photoreceptors and bipolar cells exhibit transient overshoots and undershoots to sudden input changes. Such transients are the result of each photoreceptor trying to adjust its dynamic range in response to local changes in input intensity. <p> In an earlier article, Gaudiano (1991) has shown that temporal adaptation laws of the form used in this article for the photoreceptor model lead to loss of relative spatial contrast in response to sustained images. In other words, stabilized images fade <ref> (see also Gaudiano, 1992b) </ref>. The relationship of this finding to the biologically observed fading of stabilized images will be the subject of future work. However, such loss of contrast appears to be an inescapable side effect of temporal adaptation.

Reference-contexts: Carpenter and Grossberg (1981) showed that inclusion of such a mechanism is necessary to explain certain aspects of photoreceptor dynamics.

Mathematically, Carpenter and Grossberg (1981) allowed the regeneration rate F to depend on the size of the input signal, with larger input signals increasing the regeneration rate. It can be shown that the asymmetry inequality (17) holds under this modification as well.
