Abstract: I apply existing technology for the construction of monitoring systems to the ICU data set provided by the Symposium organizers. The large volume of data in the ICU set compels any reasoning system to operate efficiently. It is also a good test of scalability of the approach. In order to reach the required efficiency, heavy use must be made of abstraction in order to limit the extent to which new data samples cause reevaluation of derived conclusions. I describe the Temporal Control System (TCS), a programming system designed for building intelligent temporal monitoring programs. Empirical results from the ICU date set validate the scalable design of the TCS. I then focus on the problem of generating interval values from sample points via persistence assumptions. The TCS provides both the framework for the implementation as well as a method of calculating the cost of different approaches. In particular, I show that limiting the time span of a persistent interval can be very costly and then suggest how the application of symbolic abstraction can help. Further performance improvements come from the development of additional temporal abstraction techniques. A TCS application consists of modules which implement arbitrary reasoning strategies, and temporal variables which hold data. Each modules dependency on temporal variables is declared in advance. TCS performs the bookkeeping tasks needed to assure that information is propagated to the appropriate modules and that the reasoning in the system is kept up-to-date. The data dependency algorithm does not depend on the particular form of reasoning used in a module. Module functions are treated as black boxes whose inputs and outputs are monitored. Whenever the input data to a module changes, the TCS schedules a process instance to execute. As input values change, this results in a chain of process instances along the time line.
