Abstract: We describe a method for mapping the functional regions of the brain using a tran-scranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) device. This device, when placed on a subject's scalp, stimulates the underlying neurons by generating focused magnetic field pulses. A brain mapping is then generated by measuring responses of different motor and sensory functions to this stimulation. The key process in generating this mapping is the association of the 3D positions and orientations of the TMS probe on the scalp to a 3D brain reconstruction such as is feasible with a magnetic resonance image (MRI). We perform this matching process by (1) registering the subject's head position to an a priori MRI scan, (2) tracking the 3D position/orientation of the TMS probe, (3) transforming the TMS probe position/orientation to the MRI coordinate frame, and (4) tracking movements in the subject's head position to factor out any head motion. The resultant process generates a high resolution, accurate brain mapping which supports surgical planning, surgical guidance, neuroanatomy research, and psychiatric therapy. When compared to other functional imaging modalities, this approach exhibits much lower cost, greater portability, and more direct active control over the functional areas being studied.

Reference-contexts: We have also collected the following TMS data: * C t o | position and orientation of TMS coil at time t, t = <ref> [1; T ] </ref>, in Pixsys coordin ates. * R t j | measured response j to stimulation t. Multiple responses are usually collected such as from several different hand, arm, and shoulder muscles. <p> The ability to relate induced magnetic stimulation response to anatomical models potentially provides the ability to identify and isolate damage to cortical tissue in a noninvasive manner. * Therapy. Some work has already begun on the utility of TMS as a therapeutic tool <ref> [1] </ref>, in the treatment of depression, akinesia, and related areas.

Reference-contexts: In order to minimize this evaluation function we use the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell (DFP) quasi-Newton method <ref> [12] </ref>. This method requires an estimate of the gradient of the objective function, which is easily obtained in closed form. Solving this minimization problem yields an estimate for the pose of the laser points in MRI coordinates. We execute this minimization stage with a multiresolution set of Gaussians.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we sum, for all transformed laser points, a term that is a sum of the distances from the transformed laser point to all nearby MRI points, where the distance is weighted by a Gaussian distribution <ref> [17] </ref>. This Gaussian weighting roughly interpolates between the sampled MRI points to estimate the nearest point on the underlying surface to the transformed laser point.
