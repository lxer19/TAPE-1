Abstract: This paper provides an analysis of the source policy in the rate-based congestion control algorithm being developed by the ATM Forum and derives approximate analytical closed-form expressions to describe the rate-increase process. These approximations are used to analyze the impact of the source algorithm on the TCP slow-start process operating over a rate-controlled ATM network where rate allocation is performed explicitly in the switches. The results show that the increase in TCP congestion window ramp-up time is noticeable when the round-trip delay is small. When the idle-detection policy is enabled at the source, the slow-start process is significantly prolonged, and results in slower recovery upon a cell loss. The results are verified by simulation.

Reference-contexts: Many service classes have been defined in ATM for the support of traffic with different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The Available Bit-Rate (ABR) service class was defined for the support of best-effort applications that may require a minimum-bandwidth guarantee <ref> [1] </ref>. This service class allows applications to fully utilize the available bandwidth in the network by adjusting their instantaneous transmission rates to the available capacity.

Reference-contexts: The ATM Forum Traffic Management Committee is currently working on a rate-based congestion control framework to satisfy this objective <ref> [2] </ref>. In the rate-based congestion control framework being developed by the ATM Forum, the source of each connection periodically transmits a special resource management (RM) cell that is used to monitor the congestion state of the network and signal it back to the source.

Reference-contexts: It is also our objective to characterize the effect of this option on TCP behavior. Several studies have been reported on the performance of TCP in ATM networks. While previous studies have focused on the effect of fragmentation of TCP segments at the ATM layer <ref> [3] </ref>, and the fairness behavior with multiple TCP connections [4], our interest in this paper is in investigating how the ATM source policy in the rate-based congestion control algorithm affects the congestion control and avoidance mechanisms currently employed in TCP.

Reference-contexts: Table 2.1 summarizes the notations for parameters used in our analysis of the source behavior, along with the corresponding terminology used in the ATM Forum Traffic Management Specification <ref> [5] </ref>. We now provide an outline of the ATM Forum congestion control framework. The rate of transmission of cells belonging to each virtual circuit is controlled individually by the source of the virtual circuit using a feedback mechanism.

Reference-contexts: The explicit-rate mode assumes the existence of an algorithm within the switch that allocate the available bandwidth on each outgoing link among the connections sharing it. Such algorithms for rate allocation in packet-switched networks have been described by Charny <ref> [6] </ref>, Kalampoukas, et al. [7], Jain [8], and Siu et al. [9]. The analysis in this paper assumes such an algorithm in the switches, and that the algorithm provides a stable allocation to a connection during its startup phase. <p> The analysis assumes the source rate increase algorithm of equation 2.1. In addition, we also assume that the rate allocation algorithm in the switches provides an allocation at least equal to the current transmission rate throughout the increase period. The rate allocation algorithms described in <ref> [6] </ref> and [7] can meet this requirement. 3.1 Approximation for zero round-trip delay Let D be the round-trip delay along the path of the connection. We assume D to be constant in this analysis. <p> The assumption of uncongested network is reasonable in the context of ATM networks that support explicit rate allocation. Under this assumption, since each connection is guaranteed a minimum rate, the performance of a TCP connection may be analyzed independent of the other connections. The rate allocation algorithms of <ref> [6, 7] </ref> meet this requirement. Assuming that the idle-source detection option is not used, the rate of the ATM source will monotonically increase during the TCP slow-start phase as the window-size is increased. However, the evolution of the source can be different from that seen in Section 3.
