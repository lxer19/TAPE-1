Abstract: Marroquin and Ramirez (1990) have recently discovered a class of discrete stochastic cellular automata with Gibbsian invariant measure that have a non-reversible dynamic behavior. Practical applications include more powerful algorithms than the Metropolis algorithm to compute MRF models. In this paper we describe a large class of stochastic dynamical systems that has a Gibbs asymptotic distribution but does not satisfy reversibility. We characterize sufficient properties of a sub-class of stochastic differential equations in terms of the associated Fokker-Planck equation for the existence of an asymptotic probability distribution in the system of coordinates which is given. Practical implications include VLSI analog circuits to compute coupled MRF models. This paper describes research done within the Center for Biological Information Processing, in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. This research is sponsored by a grant from the Office of Naval Research (ONR), Cognitive and Neural Sciences Division; by the Artificial Intelligence Center of Hughes Aircraft Corporation (S1-801534-2). Support for the A. I. Laboratory's artificial intelligence research is provided by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense under Army contract DACA76-85-C-0010, and in part by ONR contract N00014-85-K-0124. c fl Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1994
