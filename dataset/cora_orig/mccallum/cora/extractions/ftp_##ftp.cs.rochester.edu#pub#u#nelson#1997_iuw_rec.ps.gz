Abstract: It has long been recognized that, in principle object recognition problems can be solved by simple, brute force methods. However, the approach has generally been held to be completely impractical. We argue that by combining a few more or less standard tricks with computational resources that are historically large, but completely feasible by recent standards, dramatic results can be achieved for a number of recognition problems. In particular, we describe a resource-intensive, appearance-based method that utilizes intermediate-level features to provide normalized keys into a large, memorized feature database, and Bayesian evidence combination coupled with a Hough-like indexing scheme to assemble object hypotheses from the memory. This system demonstrates robust recognition of a variety of 3-D shapes, ranging from sports cars and fighter planes to snakes and lizards over full spherical or hemispherical ranges (and planar scale, translation and rotation). We report the results of various large-scale performance tests, involving, altogether, over 2000 separate test images. These include performance scaling with database size, robustness against clutter, and generic ability. The result of 97% forced choice accuracy with full orthographic invariance for 24 complex curved 3-D objects over full viewing spheres or hemispheres is the best we are aware of for this type of problem.

Reference-contexts: Most of them essentially operate by comparing an image-like representation of object appearance against many prototype representations stored in a memory, and finding the closest match. They have the advantage of being fairly general, and often easily trainable. In recent work, Poggio has recognized wire objects and faces <ref> [15, 4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The system needs a particular shape or pattern to index on, and does not work well for objects whose character is statistical, such as generic trees or pine cones. Component boundaries were extracted by modifying a stick-growing method for finding segments developed recently at Rochester <ref> [14] </ref> so that it could follow curved boundaries. The system is trained using images taken approximately every 20 degrees around the sphere, amounting to about 100 views for a full sphere, and 50 for a hemisphere. of making the templates sufficiently flexible to match between views.
