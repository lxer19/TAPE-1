Abstract: Digital libraries are a repository of documents that are large volumes of integrated text, image, video and sound data. In such an environment, users may not have an efficient access mechanisms for the data, and in some cases may not even know what is available and how and where it is located. To facilitate the users in retrieving the documents from this vast information base, digital libraries must provide interactive support. This will allow the users to enter into a dialogue with an information base server and successively refine the query if the query is not sufficient to locate the desired information. In a wide area network (WAN), such a dialogue will be communication intensive. We are currently developing a digital library prototype called DL-Raid at the Raid laboratory at Purdue University to study the feasibility and sensitivity of various retrieval schemes in distributed environments. In this paper, we present the architecture of the DL-Raid and the data model supported by this prototype. We investigate the partial content-based retrieval schemes in the prototype. We present the results of various communication experiments with large data objects and analyze these results to study their effects on the efficient retrievals of data in the digital library environment.

Reference-contexts: The operations include the procedures of accessing, retrieving, displaying, compressing/decompressing, transferring, and manipulating image data. 3 DL-Raid System Model In this section, we will introduce a six-layered system model. This system, called DL-Raid, is built on top of O-Raid <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.1 The Architecture of DL-Raid Raid (Robust, Adaptable, Interoperable, and Distributed) is a distributed database system based on the relational model built at Purdue. The system has complete support for transaction processing, concurrency control, replication control, atomicity control, access control and persistency of data in the system [3].

The communication package in Raid is a location-transparent module built on top of the UDP/IP and can model local and wide area networks. O-Raid is an extension of the Raid system and supports distributed complex data objects [5].

Reference-contexts: The task of accessing this data can be made simple by using a variety of user interfaces and the notion of digital libraries. We consider a digital library as a facility which makes use of a large amount of data accessed over a wide area network <ref> [6] </ref>. A digital library will contain text, images, and sound in an integrated document repository and will provide a uniform interface for users' (local/remote) access to a vast amount of varied kinds of data.

Reference-contexts: All the features dedicated to digital library applications are constructed as an extension upon the O-Raid system, which is itself left intact. Furthermore, the functions supported by O-Raid, such as object composition, class definition, indexing <ref> [11] </ref>, user-defined functions, and communications facilities, can be reused by DL-Raid. The DL-Raid system will allow storage, retrieval, and transmission of digital library objects.

Reference-contexts: Physical descriptions like color, shape, size will be used to filter out unwanted images. 18 This classification will be very tedious and time-consuming if done manually. Text descriptors can be generated in a semi-automatic fashion if the domain of images is limited <ref> [18] </ref>. NASA data, geographic information systems, data banks of research articles are all examples of information bases that can relate to a specific domain. Once a domain has been identified, we formulate the classification within the domain. <p> Once a domain has been identified, we formulate the classification within the domain. A low-level image analysis module will recognize the basic objects in it and their associated distinguishing attributes <ref> [18] </ref>. An image can belong to more than one class. In a distributed system, different classes of images can be stored at different sites. Consider the following scenario. The weather bureau stores images under the class weather and this class receives new images every second.

Reference-contexts: These constructs are used to define unique names for objects, identify class of objects, and provide operations and mappings among objects. Based on this model, we plan to develop a uniform interface to access the underlying information bases. Supporting both a relational and an object-oriented data model <ref> [20] </ref>, O-Raid offers several potential advantages for the implementation of digital library systems. In DL-Raid, both alphanumerical data and some metadata (including bibliographic and descriptive data) are represented using a relational model, while other types of digital library data are best suited for the object model.

Reference-contexts: Relevant data can be located without searching the entire information repository. Communication experiments are conducted to study the communication delays for large unstructured data objects and to evaluate their impact on content-based retrieval schemes. We use the WANCE tool <ref> [21] </ref>, developed in the Raid laboratory at Purdue University, for our communication experiments. Our experiments help us to categorize the retrieval methods based on how communication intensive they are. <p> Currently, the Raid system uses UDP as the communica 15 tion protocol to transmit data within a LAN/WAN environment. TCP or other new protocols may be considered as alternatives for the prototype system. The approach presented in <ref> [21] </ref> will be useful in conducting experiments over wide area networks within the LAN environment. Communication facilities may be further extended to the ATM network. 4 Supporting for Partial Content-Based Re trievals in DL-Raid We will now discuss the retrieval approaches that are to be supported in the DL-Raid system. <p> Accessing this data over the wide area network further complicates the analysis of communications. We are using the WANCE (Wide Area Network Communication Emulation) tool <ref> [21] </ref>, developed in Raid Laboratory at Purdue University, for conducting experiments on large objects and analyzing 21 the delays and losses in their transmission over the Internet. <p> Such emulation experiment requires no control over the remote site, it thus allow us to conduct experiment using virtually any site in the Internet. Compared with real experiments, measurements by emulation carries a mere 3% relative error <ref> [21] </ref>. 5.2 Experimental Results The communication experiments we have conducted reveal large variation in response time as the size of data transferred changes, format quality of data changes, or distance of place where data is sent changes. We show below the details of the experimental results.
