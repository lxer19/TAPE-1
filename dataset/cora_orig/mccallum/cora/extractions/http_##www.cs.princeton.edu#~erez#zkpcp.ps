Abstract: We construct PCPs with strong zero-knowledge properties. First, we construct polynomi U arbitrary queries, where U can be set to any polynomial. Second, we construct PCPs In the course of constructing these PCP's we abstract a tool we call locking systems. We ally bounded (in size) PCP's for NP which can be checked using poly-logarithmic queries, with

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 can be generalized to handle any number of bits read by the original PCP, and any number of random coin tosses by the original verifier. We chose to keep the complexity of the statement reasonable and still to cover the PCP constructed by the PCP theorem <ref> [1] </ref>. Our second construction allows the PCPs to be exponentially large, but achieves superpolynomial robustness (with an exponentially small error). Without going into all of the parameters, we obtain the following result.

Reference-contexts: However, PCPs are formally viewed as sequences of bits; there is no entity in place to judge a question's legitimacy. Consequently, the theorem that everything provable in MIP is provable in zero-knowledge <ref> [2, 7] </ref> does not translate over automatically. Dwork et al. [3] introduce the notion of zero-knowledge or "robust" PCP's. A robust PCP (; V ) is a distribution on PCPs along with a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier V .

Reference-contexts: Kilian and Naor [8] directly use robust PCPs to establish the strongest known hardness of approximation results for certain problems in statistical inference. Feige and Kilian <ref> [4] </ref> use PCPs inspired by robust PCPs, though with slightly weaker properties, to show the strongest known results for approximating the chromatic number. 1.2 The results in this paper We exhibit new constructions for robust PCPs. The properties of our first construction is embodied in Theorem 1, below.

Reference-contexts: Robust PCPs and the hardness of approximation Our motivation for this investigation is primarily philosophical. However, it is worth noting that constructions for robust PCPs, or variants thereof have been used to prove results on the hardness of approximation. Kilian and Naor <ref> [8] </ref> directly use robust PCPs to establish the strongest known hardness of approximation results for certain problems in statistical inference.
