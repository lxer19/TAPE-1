Abstract: Word shape information can be helpful in handwriting recognition. It can be used by a segmentation based recognizer to verify the results of the recognition of individual segmented letters. It is often one of the main features used by wholistic recognizers. This paper describes extraction of the word shape information through identification of the middle zone, then ascenders and descenders. Extracted information is applied both in a bottom-up and top-down fashion resulting in a verification mechanism for existing segmentation based system and a new wholistic recognizer. The wholistic recognizer is found relatively weak. However, when the two are combined, a significant improvement is observed. Recognition results are presented.

Reference-contexts: The ascenders and descenders are located using the word zoning information. The word length is estimated using the number of times an imaginary horizontal line intersects the trace of the pen in its most dense area <ref> [1] </ref>. No estimation of the number of letters within the word is made. Typically two approaches to zoning information extraction are applied [4]: histogram method; extrema method. The histogram method is more efficient in detecting the presence of various zones, but has difficulties with reliably locating real boundaries. <p> Approximate metrics of letter width are used. The position limits vary for each database word pattern that the data are compared to. This produced better results than estimating the number of letters and dividing the word into equal regions, as presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. Highest results are obtained for the hybrid system. In this case the word shape recognition with letter verification appears to be the natural extension to the word ending postulation [10]. Attempts to use word shape in conjunction with other approaches are reported also for static recognition, e.g. [5].

Reference-contexts: Use of recognized letter alternatives Word shape encoding applied in the described system ignores nearly all information that can be found in the middle zone. Features like loops, arcs, cusps, concavities and convexities (e.g. a set of features described in <ref> [3] </ref>) could be used to make word encoding more specific. Another possibility is to attempt to locate and recognize all the letters within the word and Score min F 1 X 1 ( ) F 2 X 2 ( ) ...

The extrema method has more difficulties with detecting distinct zones, but is better at locating precise zone boundaries. <p> Table 1 presents the results of word zoning classification of 3600 handwritten words. It can be seen that nearly 20% of words were not correctly classified. This rate is similar to results reported by other researchers <ref> [4] </ref>. However, when considering the two best choices of the word zoning classifier, the majority of words are classified correctly. 2.2. Location of ascenders and descenders The obtained zoning classification is used as a guide for locating ascenders and descenders. They are located using local extrema.

Reference-contexts: It is extremely difficult to extract reliable zoning information for some handwriting styles. Such styles are currently not isolated and consequently treated like all other cases. A better approach might be to identify handwriting styles difficult to zone and lower the influence of the word shape recognizer <ref> [7] </ref>. Some individual handwriting variations strongly affect the word shape. The system currently lacks any mechanisms to adjust to such variations. The word shape recognizer, contrary to those described in [1][2], uses very few features. Hence it has problems with disambiguating the results. <p> HYBRID2 1 53.7 / 22.9 49.9 / 23.9 40.8 / 16.3 57.0 / 19.6 70.0 / 18.0 74.8 / 16.3 Table 4: Average recognition rates for various tested recognizers, small lexicon (mean recognition rate [%] / standard deviation). choose the best recognizers for a particular handwriting style as proposed in <ref> [7] </ref>. The more strict recognizer, based on the multiple interactive segmentation, can be used to adjust the word shape recognizer to a particular style. Methods for assessment of whole word recognition characteristics are investigated to provide guidance for results combination. The word shape calculation can be improved further.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Zoning information is an important feature in cursive script recognition <ref> [8] </ref>. It allows distinction between letters which are very similar, either for human readers (e.g. c and C), or for specific recognition algorithms (e.g. a and d for an algorithm based on the angular variation of the pen path). <p> A number of feature filters are applied to each obtained word alternative in order to verify its recognition score [10]. These include a measure of the amount of ink data representing the letters, horizontal overlaps, dots and dashes, and a very approximate zoning <ref> [8] </ref>. More reliable zoning information could be used to replace zoning related feature filters. It could be applied before the lexical lookup and considerably reduce the graph of letter alternatives. Knowing the zoning classification of the word, the recognition proceeds in the context of the calculated zoning information. <p> As shown, the bottom-up application of the zoning information does not increase the recognition rate in comparison to the recognizer using zoning-related feature filters <ref> [8] </ref>. However, the recognizer becomes more certain. The rejection rate rises and the average number of word alternatives produced per each processed word decreases (Figure 6). This can be considered an advantage. The recognition time is also decreased by the bottom-up use of the word shape information.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes work on extraction and application of word zoning and shape to cursive script recognition. Two main approaches are described: bottom-up, where the word is recognized using multiple interactive segmentation <ref> [9] </ref> and zoning information is used to eliminate many wrong answers; top-down, where calculated word shape is compared with all words in the lexicon in order to find similar ones. <p> Methods for extraction and use of the word shape information are presented and the encountered difficulties described. The obtained recognition results are reported and compared with those of a previously developed cursive script recognizer based on multiple interactive segmentation <ref> [9] </ref>. 2. Word shape extraction Throughout this paper the term word shape is understood as the information on presence, sequence and relative position of ascenders and descenders within the word, and the approximate word length. The ascenders and descenders are located using the word zoning information. <p> Bottom-up application of shape information This section describes the bottom-up application of zoning information. A segmentation based cursive script recognizer is used. Letters are segmented and recognized using multiple interactive segmentation <ref> [9] </ref>. A lexicon is applied to discard disallowed letter sequences. A number of feature filters are applied to each obtained word alternative in order to verify its recognition score [10]. <p> The multiple interactive segmentation <ref> [9] </ref> is a readily available mechanism for location and recognition of letters within a word. The number and confidence scores of located letters are used to judge the degree of similarity of the proposed word to the data being recognized.

These include a measure of the amount of ink data representing the letters, horizontal overlaps, dots and dashes, and a very approximate zoning [8]. More reliable zoning information could be used to replace zoning related feature filters. <p> As a result, the word shape recognition has difficulty in choosing the correct answer as the best alternative, even though it is likely to find the correct word more often. In order to maximise advantages of both approaches, they are combined into a hybrid system <ref> [10] </ref>. Both multiple interactive segmentation and word shape letter recognizers are applied and their results are combined. The objective is to produce the correct word alternative even for difficult to recognize words and to increase its ranking proportional to the number of letters that can be identified and recognized. <p> The trade-off is the increased processing time and decreased certainty of the system, as the word shape recognizer nearly always produces some answers. Limiting the lexicon size usually has a positive effect on the recognition rate <ref> [10] </ref>. In the case of word shape and hybrid recognizers, the improvement is significant. Table 4 presents average recognition rates obtained by different recognizers for a lexicon of 200 words. The word shape recognizer with letter verification can be used on its own. <p> Highest results are obtained for the hybrid system. In this case the word shape recognition with letter verification appears to be the natural extension to the word ending postulation <ref> [10] </ref>. Attempts to use word shape in conjunction with other approaches are reported also for static recognition, e.g. [5]. The currently used results combination approach is very simple. More sophisticated approaches require a statistical assessment of the recognizer characteristics [13]. 8.

Reference-contexts: Allowing the threshold lines to be tiered, like in <ref> [12] </ref> would further increase the flexibility. Table 2 presents the effectiveness of locating the ascenders and descenders for different choices of word zoning classification. It can be observed that the obtained results are lower than those of word zoning classification (Table 1). This indicates problems with the method chosen.

Reference-contexts: The word comparison takes into account the position of ascenders/descenders within the word. In order to compare different words, their lengths are normalised to be equal. Fuzzy logic is applied to the word shape comparison <ref> [14] </ref>. Positions of ascenders/ descenders within the matched word are represented as fuzzy sets (Figure 5b). For each of the sets the degree of membership of the position of appropriate ascender/descender within the database is calculated. <p> The minimum function implements AND in fuzzy logic <ref> [14] </ref>. This implies that all the ascenders/descenders within the compared words should be in their expected positions in order to obtain a good similarity score. Word length is further taken into account in order to distinguish between words of similar shape but differing in length.
