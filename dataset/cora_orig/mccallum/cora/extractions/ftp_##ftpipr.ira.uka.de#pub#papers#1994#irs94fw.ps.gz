Abstract: A mobile robot that navigates in unknown or changing environment needs to maintain a dynamic model of its environment in order to update existing knowledge about the world. This paper addresses the problem of how to update a local model of the perceivable environment of a mobile robot and how to produce a description of newly perceived obstacles. A new hybrid concept is presented which combines the advantages of parameter- and grid based modelling techniques. By introducing local grids that only cover areas where new obstacles are expected, the complexity of the map building process is significantly reduced. Local grids can be used in dynamic environment which was not possible with earlier grid-modelling approaches. The information, grids are constructed from, is provided by ultrasonic range sensors and an active stereo-vision system. Fusing information of both sensor systems is advantageous, especially due to their complementary error characteristics concerning range and angular resolution.

Reference-contexts: Each layer consists of a perception module and a navigation/control module. The task of the perception modules is to construct a description of the environment which provides information necessary for navigation <ref> [1] </ref>. for reflexive behaviors are driving a longer distance while avoiding collisions, passing a door or a narrow passage or docking at a workstation. The structure of the world model is different on each level.

Reference-contexts: However, the large number of cells necessary for precise mapping, results in time consuming grid update procedures. Apart from simplified grid based approaches used for collision avoidance <ref> [2] </ref>, certainty grids can not be used in dynamic environments so far. In this paper, a solution to the problem of modelling a mobile robot's local environment in presence of dynamic obstacles is offered. The idea of local certainty grids which are constructed around newly perceived obstacles is presented.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 1.: The mobile system PRIAMOS equipped with a ring of 24 ultrasonic sensors and an active stereo vision system. In the literature two principles are described how to integrate new data in an existing world model: Parametric approaches normally use a surface or volumetric description of objects <ref> [4] </ref>. Though such a description is appealing due to its simplicity, it is difficult to integrate new objects. The problem is to gain a parametric description from only little data. Large errors in object models are a consequence which is later difficult to correct. <p> Detailed description of such simultanous position update and map correction can e.g. be found in <ref> [4, 7] </ref>. The problem of such position correction is convergence. If the position error exceeds a certain limit (this limit is not fix, but depends on the obstacle configuration and the quality of the robots internal map) kalman-filtering will no longer produce reasonable correction values. <p> The measurements which belong to one plane according to the prediction are integrated using a Kalman filter (in the way described in <ref> [4] </ref>). In such a way a refinement of an object position and a probability on how accurate it is known is produced. Observations which do not match any parametric object description indicate new obstacles.

Reference-contexts: Large errors in object models are a consequence which is later difficult to correct. An attractive method to fuse sensor data taken at different times, from different positions and even by different sensor systems is offered by certainty grids <ref> [5, 8] </ref>. In certainty grids space is represented by a grid with each cell holding a value corresponding to the probability that an obstacle is located in that region. However, the large number of cells necessary for precise mapping, results in time consuming grid update procedures. <p> A later interpretation process has no possibility to distinguish if a sensor beam never scanned a region or if an obstacle was partially present in an often observed region. This analysis lead to an extension of the grid concept as already mentioned in <ref> [5] </ref>. Decrease of cell probabilities is necessary, as wrong measurements must be corrected by later data. But combining decrease and increase of cells causes loss of information. A solution is to generate two parallel grids instead of only one. These twin grids cover the same region.

Reference-contexts: The second step is the mapping procedure itself. Mapping continues until enough information about an object is available and it can be considered as known. Identification is based on sonar data. For reliable prediction of sonar range, a module has been developed <ref> [6] </ref> which takes sonar characteristics into account, such as occurrence of multiple reflections or missing echos due to bad orientation of a surface. 5.1 The Local Grid Concept The probability where in the sonar beam an echo was initiated can be described by a 2-dimensional normal distribution (uncertainty in range and
