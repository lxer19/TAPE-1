Abstract: We use generalized particle trajectories to derive an analytic expression characterizing the probability distribution of boundary-completion shape. This is essential to the understanding of the perceptual phenomenon of illusory (subjective) contours. The particles' dynamics include Poisson-distributed ensembles of driving forces as well as particle decay. The resulting field, representing completed surface boundaries, is characterized by the fraction of particles at x with velocity _x. The distributions are projectively covariant in the sense that fields calculated in any lower-dimensional projection correspond to the projections of fields calculated in any higher dimension. Being analytic, the relationship between velocity, diffusivity, and decay can be made readily apparent.

More recently, Guy and Medioni <ref> [2] </ref> describe a method for computing a vector-field representing global image structure from local tangent measurements. The key to their approach is the local summation of a set of global voting patterns representing orientations which are co-circular to the tangent measurements.

Reference-contexts: The key to their approach is the local summation of a set of global voting patterns representing orientations which are co-circular to the tangent measurements. Consequently, the vector-field is non-stochastic (i.e., deterministic), and cannot model the prior distribution of completion shapes. Heitger and von der Heydt <ref> [3] </ref> describe a theory of figural completion based upon nonlinear combination of the convolutions of "keypoint" images with a fixed set of oriented grouping filters. <p> These represent locations where one surface boundary occludes another. Following <ref> [3] </ref>, these will be termed keypoints.

Reference-contexts: This random walk has the property that maximum likelihood paths are curves of least energy (i.e., the shape commonly assumed to model the shape of illusory contours <ref> [4] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The phenomenon of illusory contours is much studied by visual psychologists and provides a compelling example of human visual competence not yet demonstrated by computer vision systems. Recently, a novel theory of illusory contour shape and salience has appeared. Williams and Jacobs <ref> [11] </ref> defined the illusory contour shape and salience problem to be the problem of computing the the shape and relative likelihood (as determined by the prior probability distribution) of the family of curves which potentially connect (or complete) a set of contrast edges. <p> which satisfy the constraints, fx i ; _x i g: f (x; _x) = S (x; _x) dx d _xS (x; _x) where S (x; _x) = ( i=1 n X M 2 (x j ; _x j j x; _x)) is the stochastic completion field of Williams and Jacobs <ref> [11] </ref> and M 1 (x; _x j x i ; _x i ) = 1 M 2 (x; _x j x j ; _x j ) = t 3 represent the contributions of each keypoint to what they refer to as the source and sink fields. <p> This corresponds to letting particles decay with an average rate of 1=t 21 . Because this makes longer trajectories exponentially less likely, both Mumford [6] and Williams and Jacobs <ref> [11] </ref> employed this mechanism to model the component of the prior distribution of completion shape dependent on length. <p> Significantly, this suggests that the method of <ref> [11] </ref> is robust to details of the stochastic process generating the completion fields. <p> minimum at mid-trajectory, dropping to only one-eighth the value one would ordinarily have expected (see Figure 2). 4 As with (x 3 ) 2 , ( _x 3 ) 2 also vanishes with T despite the necessity of fluctuations to match the boundary conditions. 7 Comparison w/Monte Carlo Method In <ref> [11] </ref> the stochastic completion field was computed for a range of illusory contour figures from the visual psychology literature. This was accomplished by exploiting the fact that the stochastic completion field can be computed directly as the product of two vector-field convolutions. <p> T 2 t 4 exp T t 3 x 2 + y 2 (x (1 + cos ) + y sin )t + (2 + cos )t 2 =3 and numerically integrating over the independent variable representing total transit time (i.e., t) using Simpson's method. 5 Because the original treatment <ref> [11] </ref> used particles with a finite half-life, we used a time weighting function Q (t) of the form exp (t=t ). <p> In contrast with the Monte Carlo method, where it is difficult to achieve more than three significant digits of 5 We have also approximated this integral analytically using the method of steepest descent (see Appendix B). <ref> [11] </ref> (summed over all orientations). <p> This distribution is meant to represent an Ehrenstein figure (see Figure 3). The keypoints are located at endpoints of the four line segments comprising the figure and are oriented normal to the segments. Figure 4 (top) shows the stochastic completion field computed using the method of <ref> [11] </ref>. The magnitudes are summed over the 36 discrete orientations so that the stochastic completion field can be displayed as a brightness image. <p> The second demonstration is the well known Kanizsa triangle [5] (see Figure 5 (top)). The source distribution consisted of a set of oriented impulses representing the orientations of contours bounding regions of constant brightness at positive maxima of curvature (see <ref> [11] </ref>). In general, these are points where it is likely that one surface occludes another. Figure 5 (bottom left) shows the stochastic completion field from [11] (summed over all orientations). For illustrative purposes, it is superimposed on the brightness gradient magnitude image. <p> source distribution consisted of a set of oriented impulses representing the orientations of contours bounding regions of constant brightness at positive maxima of curvature (see <ref> [11] </ref>).

Finally, stochastic completion fields for a several illusory contour figures from the literature were computed using convolution kernels generated by both the Monte Carlo method and by numerical integration of the analytic expression.
