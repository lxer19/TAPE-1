Reference-contexts: Introduction Pulsed semiconductor diode lasers and CCD detectors invite low cost, high speed, high precision optical diffraction and interference measurements of mechanical locations and dimensions. A diode laser, a high current pulsed power supply, and a triggering circuit <ref> [1] </ref> can be built into a penlight-size module capable of delivering fast ( 200 nsec) pulses of high power ( 10 watts) in the near infra-red ( 0.9 mm) at high repetition rates ( 2 kHz) inexpensively ( $200).

Reference-contexts: A linear CCD array of 256 elements, its clocking circuits, and output signal amplifiers can be purchased as an evaluation board <ref> [2] </ref> or user-assembled into a compact module for another $200. The dimensional accuracy of the CCD pixelation (typically on 13 mm centers) makes it an attractive ruler.

Reference-contexts: The dimensional accuracy of CCD pixelation must be extremely high: the only practical way to maintain layer-to-layer alignment of large scale integrated circuit devices is for each process step to be dimensionally accurate in an absolute sense <ref> [3] </ref>. On the other hand, despite the accuracy of the ruler, in the absence of a good sub-pixel interpolation scheme the precision of location and dimension measurements made with a 13 mm ruler can be at best mediocre relative to the sub-mm measurement requirements of practical interest in many contexts.

Reference-contexts: Sub-pixel interpolation is usually done by a local gray-level method, e.g., a gray-registering pixel straddled by a white-registering pixel and a black-registering pixel is defined to be partially obscured by a step-function edge whose location is linearly interpolated via the gray-level intensity <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The optical fiber case, at least, is clearly amenable to diffraction measurements at large scattering angles, where due to refraction and internal reflection a large angle signal is available in transmission <ref> [5] </ref>, [6]. However strands composed of multiple fibers are practically opaque, and only diffusely reflecting, precluding large angle scattering methods.

Reference-contexts: Diffraction patterns are broadly classed as Fresnel or Fraunhoffer based on the simplifying approximations that can be made about the phase factors under the integral signs in, e.g., Huygens' Principle <ref> [7] </ref> or Green's Function [8] models of optical field propagation. For the purposes of this report, it is reasonable to say that a Fresnel pattern is a shadow (no lens used) and a Fraunhoffer pattern is an image (lens used).

Reference-contexts: At n = 0, i.e., at the center of the diffraction pattern, interference is also constructive; this accounts for the bright spot at the center of each pattern, analogous to the well known bright spot found at the center of the shadow of a small disk or sphere <ref> [10] </ref>. The locations of the regularly spaced small wiggles in the real and simulated data are in excellent agreement with the prediction of Equation 3 for consecutive even values of n.
