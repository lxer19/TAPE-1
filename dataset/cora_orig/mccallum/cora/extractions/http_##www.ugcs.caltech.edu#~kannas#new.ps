Abstract: The problem is to locate a target signature waveform among decoys in a given acoustic signal. The approach we took is to use Wavelet Decomposition not with the standard Daubechies wavelets but with a basis of dilated and translated wavelets which are modeled from the target signature waveform. We present a method here where we take advantage of the very fast computation of the Fast Wavelet Transform using Daubechies wavelets while also having the advantage of the high accuracy of using a customized wavelet. The general method is as follows. We have two sets of basis. The target waveform is dilated and translated to form a basis of waveforms. The well-known Daubechies wavelets form the other set of basis. A change of basis matrix which allows expression in one basis if expression in the other is known, is created. Now, the signal is wavelet transformed using the standard Daubechies wavelets. The customization comes in re-expressing the resulting coefficients in the target signature basis by using the above-mentioned transformation matrix. The magnitude of these re-expressed coeffcients pinpoints the location of the target waveform.
