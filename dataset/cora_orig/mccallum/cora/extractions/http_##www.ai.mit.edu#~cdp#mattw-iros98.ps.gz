Abstract: This paper presents an approach to robot arm control based on exploiting the dynamical properties of a simple oscillator circuit coupled to the joints of an arm. Using the same architecture, a wide variety of tasks can be achieved without any explicit modeling of the arm or its environment. The inherent properties of the oscillators give robustness to perturbations and changes in frequency. The approach is implemented on two compliant arms, and is demonstrated to swing pendulums at their natural frequencies, turn cranks and manipulate 'Slinky' toys.

The arms are especially designed to interact stably and robustly with unstructured environments. They are lightweight and use series elastic actuators at every joint [12], which provide low noise force control, shock tolerance and stable interaction with passive environments [3].

Reference-contexts: When the feedback is on, the angles are coordinated and the crank is turned, otherwise there is no coordination. to this kind of manipulation (hybrid force/position control [13], or impedance control <ref> [6] </ref>), use explicit kinematic knowledge of the arm and the crank location to solve this problem. Like the oscillator system, these methods are sensitive to errors in crank location.

Reference-contexts: The rejection of perturbations, as well as the reduced need to model the actuated system make this approach suitable for working in unstructured environments. Alternative approaches, of either determining the system frequencies by modeling the dynamics, or directly identifying the system <ref> [7] </ref> would also work, but could not respond so quickly to changes in the system dynamics. 4 Interaction with position constraints This section explores the behavior of the oscillators when the motion of the actuated limb is imposed by some other system.

Reference-contexts: By coupling together the oscillators and the arm in different dynamical situations (when the arm is free, constrained, manipulating objects etc.) different tasks can be performed. This allows a different approach to robot control; instead of modeling the dynamics and reasoning about them <ref> [8] </ref>, the interaction between arm and oscillator dynamics is exploited to perform tasks easily. The oscillators exhibit a strong entrainment property, responding over a wide range of frequencies with a single set of parameters, making the overall system robust to changes in system properties. <p> This is a place where traditional robotic methods might be useful. The oscillators could handle the dynamic aspects of the task, while model based approaches deal with the arm gross motion and position. In his paper on dynamic manipulation, Mason <ref> [8] </ref> commented that scaling a model-based approach to exploit the full dynamics of the arm was difficult.
