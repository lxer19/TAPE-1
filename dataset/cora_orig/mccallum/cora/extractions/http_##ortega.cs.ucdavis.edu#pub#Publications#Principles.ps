Reference-contexts: While it is difficult to predict future traffic characteristics, we believe that our approach provides a reasonable framework for analysis and design. 4.4 Simulated Annealing Simulated annealing (along with genetic algorithms) has been found to provide good solutions for hard optimization problems <ref> [1] </ref>. In the simulated annealing process, the algorithm starts with an initial random configuration for the virtual topology. Node-exchange operations are used to arrive at neighboring configurations.

Reference-contexts: Because there is no wavelength conversion in the WRS, the wavelength of the lightpath stays the same in the output fiber as it was in the input fiber. This architecture is a combination of the well-known "single-hop" [19] and "multihop" <ref> [2, 7, 8, 20] </ref> approaches, and it attempts to exploit the characteristics of both. A "lightpath" in this architecture provides "single-hop" communication.

The Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem (Subproblems 2 and 3) for routing connections in circuit-switched networks has been studied in <ref> [3, 25, 29] </ref>. In [29], a heuristic algorithm is presented for effectively assigning a limited number of wavelengths among the access stations of a multihop switched network. <p> In [29], a heuristic algorithm is presented for effectively assigning a limited number of wavelengths among the access stations of a multihop switched network.

Reference-contexts: The virtual topology chosen for our illustration is a 16-node hypercube (e.g., Fig. 2), although algorithms for arbitrary virtual topology embedding will be studied later in this paper. Two embeddings which result from the optimization criteria for hypercube embedding studied in <ref> [21] </ref> are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. One of these embeddings (Fig. 5) assumes that all of the local laser-filter pairs at a node operate on different wavelengths, while the other (Fig. 4) does not. <p> For example, the CA1-NE virtual link in Fig. 5 could be set up as an all-optical channel on one of several possible wavelengths on one of several possible physical paths, e.g., CA1-UT-CO-NE, or CA1-WA-IL-NE, or others (see Fig. 5). According to the solution in <ref> [21] </ref>, the first path is chosen on wavelength 2 for this CA1-NE lightpath. This means that the WRSs at the UT and CO nodes must be properly configured to establish this CA1-NE lightpath. <p> One instance of this problem has been formulated as a mixed integer linear program which gets difficult to solve with increasing 6 problem size [14]. Accordingly, heuristic approaches have been employed to solve these problems [4, 14]. Related work on these problems can be found in <ref> [8, 21, 24, 29] </ref>.

The Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem (Subproblems 2 and 3) for routing connections in circuit-switched networks has been studied in [3, 25, 29]. <p> This is due to the fact that, as the nodal degree is increased, the average hop distance of the virtual topology is reduced, which provides the extra improvement in the scaleup. Minimizing hop distance can be an important optimization problem, and has been studied in <ref> [24] </ref>. Although no constraints on wavelengths per fiber were imposed in this study, we also examined the wavelength requirements to set up a virtual topology using shortest-path routing of lightpaths on the physical topology.

Reference-contexts: Subproblem 1 addresses how to properly utilize the limited number of available transmitters and receivers. Sub-problems 2 and 3 deal with proper usage of the limited number of available wavelengths, and has been addressed in <ref> [3, 25] </ref>. Subproblem 4 minimizes the effect of store-and-forward (queueing plus transmission) delays at intermediate electronic hops. 4.2 Previous Work The problem of designing optimal virtual topologies has been studied before [4, 14]. <p> The work in [24] uses the physical topology as a subset of the virtual topology, employing algorithms for maximizing the throughput subject to bounded delay characteristics. The Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem (Subproblems 2 and 3) for routing connections in circuit-switched networks has been studied in <ref> [3, 25, 29] </ref>. In [29], a heuristic algorithm is presented for effectively assigning a limited number of wavelengths among the access stations of a multihop switched network. <p> The Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) problem (Subproblems 2 and 3) for routing connections in circuit-switched networks has been studied in [3, 25, 29]. In [29], a heuristic algorithm is presented for effectively assigning a limited number of wavelengths among the access stations of a multihop switched network. In <ref> [25] </ref>, an upper bound is derived on the carried traffic for any RWA algorithm, while in [3], a sequence of algorithms is assembled to efficiently solve large instances of the RWA problem.

Reference-contexts: In addition, when the prevailing traffic pattern changes, a different set of "light-paths" forming a different "multihop" virtual topology may be more desirable. A networking challenge is to perform the necessary reconfiguration with minimal disruption to the network's operations <ref> [14, 15, 26] </ref>. In this architecture, using wavelength multiplexers provides the advantage of higher aggregate system capacity due to spatial reuse of wavelengths and supports a large number of users, given a limited number of wavelengths.

Reference-contexts: These "lengths" or "cost rates" are used to pose a shortest-path flow problem (which can be solved using one of several well-known algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, etc. <ref> [27] </ref>) and the resulting paths represent the "cheapest" paths on which some of the flow may be deviated. An iterative algorithm determines how much of the original flow needs to be deviated.

Reference-contexts: Conflict-free wavelength routing in wide-area optical networks employing the concept of Latin Squares for configuring the wavelength switches is studied in [6]. Some theoretical results on the bounds for minimum congestion routing have also been studied in <ref> [28] </ref> by using the concept of flow trees to study minimum and maximum congestion for a network. Some approaches also employ wavelength conversion at intermediate nodes [16].
