Abstract: Acknowledgements: We gratefully acknowledge advice on multiple versions of the manuscript from Steve Lisberger, as well as helpful comments from Mark Kvale, Michael Crair, Ed Rut-hazer, and Michael Stryker. We thank the latter three and Deda Gillespie for sharing their experimental results with us at preliminary stages. We gratefully acknowledge support by NIH (grants NS07067 and EY11001), and by grants from the Searle Scholars' Program and the Lucille P. Markey Charitable Trust.

Reference-contexts: For the sake of completeness, however, we have made a limited study of the effect of variation in C SUM on development. The results of this study are available as a supplement to the present paper <ref> (Erwin and Miller, 1998) </ref>. Time-Varying Correlation Functions: Sequential Development of ORI and OD Modes We showed above that OD and ORI maps can jointly develop under a time-invariant set of correlation functions.
