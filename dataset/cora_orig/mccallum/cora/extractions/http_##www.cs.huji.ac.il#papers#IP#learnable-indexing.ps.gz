Abstract: Object recognition starts from a set of image measurements (including locations of points, lines, surfaces, color, and shading), which provides access into a database where representations of objects are stored. We describe a complexity theory of indexing, a meta-analysis which identifies the best set of measurements (up to algebraic transformations) such that: (1) the representation of objects are linear subspaces and thus easy to learn; (2) direct indexing is efficient since the linear subspaces are of minimal rank. Index complexity is determined via a simple process, equivalent to computing the rank of a matrix. We readily rederive the index complexity of the few previously analyzed cases. We then compute the best index for new and more interesting cases: 6 points in one perspective image, 6 directions in one para-perspective image, and 2 perspective images of 7 points. With color we get the following result: 4 color sensors are sufficient for color constancy at a point, and the sensor-output index is irreducible; the most efficient representation of a color is a plane in 3D space. For future applications with any vision problem where the relations between shape and image measurements can be written down, we give an automatic process to construct the most efficient database that can be directly obtained by learning from examples.

Reference-contexts: The analysis also gives that there is no smaller subspace of the colors, which is insensitive to the illuminant color. 4 Decreasing index complexity by adding class constraints Once it has been shown that model-free invariants do not exist for unconstrained objects <ref> [1, 8] </ref>, attention had turned to characterizing the constraints (or classes of objects) which would lead to model-free invariants [8, 11], or in our language, lead to index complexity 0.

Reference-contexts: Since an image gives only 2 constraints on these 3 numbers, clearly the images of the object describe a 2-dimensional manifold in the original index space R 3 . However, it has been shown (see <ref> [2, 14] </ref>) that there is a 2-dimensional index vector, such that the shape is described by a line a 1-dimensional subspace in the new index space R 2 . <p> Once again we compare this result with the literature. A straightforward analysis shows that the manifold which contains all the images of the 4 points is a non-linear manifold of rank 2 in R 4 (see also <ref> [2, 9] </ref>). The argument is the following: we first ignore image differences that are due to translations, rotations, or scale in the image plane.

Reference-contexts: Jacobs <ref> [5] </ref> showed recently that for 6 points in a single perspective image, the lowest rank picture manifold is a non-linear manifold of rank 3 in R 4 . We obtained the same rank 3, while using a different 4-dimensional measurement vector (a different indexing space).

Reference-contexts: Continuing to search through this ideal, we found the minimal complexity linear manifold with a rank of 2. C = 2: The color at a point Using the linear combination color model <ref> [7] </ref>, the color of an object or a light source can be described as a linear combination of a set of basis color functions of wavelength . It has been argued that 3 basis functions can approximate well the color of natural objects and light sources.

Reference-contexts: This seems like a reasonable price to pay, since the advantages of linear representation far outweigh the disadvantages. To use an efficient index whose complexity is n, it is necessary to use at least n + 1 independent measurements. However, as shown in <ref> [13] </ref>, if we use 2n + 1 measurement, we guarantee that the representations of 2 different objects will have a 0 probability of intersecting, which would guarantee the uniqueness of the representation and the efficiency of the indexing process. Our formalism is completely automatic.

Reference-contexts: More generally, the index given in (2) is an element of R r . If r = 1 it is a model-free invariant; if r &gt; 1 it is a model-based invariant as defined in <ref> [14] </ref>. The database now is an r-dimensional table, and a pointer to object S is stored in all the cells of the table that satisfy (1). In order to achieve efficient recognition, we would like to find a representation of the form (1) with the smallest r. <p> Since an image gives only 2 constraints on these 3 numbers, clearly the images of the object describe a 2-dimensional manifold in the original index space R 3 . However, it has been shown (see <ref> [2, 14] </ref>) that there is a 2-dimensional index vector, such that the shape is described by a line a 1-dimensional subspace in the new index space R 2 . <p> It has already been shown in <ref> [14] </ref> that there are 2 model-based invariant relations between the model and the image. The index complexity of each relation is trivially 4. The 2 relations can be algebraically combined to further 10 reduced complexity, leading to a relation with index complexity 3.
