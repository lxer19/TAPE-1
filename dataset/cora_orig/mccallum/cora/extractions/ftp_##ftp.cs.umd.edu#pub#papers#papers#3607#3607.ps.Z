Reference-contexts: In other words, these verbs do not entail a natural end (the definition of telic-ity in (Olsen, 1994a), inter alia). In this way, correspond, meet (with), and chitchat verbs resemble degree achievements <ref> (Abusch, 1985) </ref>, such as cool and thin, which also pass the telicity tests, but allow continuance of the event. The degree achievements, however, do eventually reach a natural limit (when the relevant object reaches the state named by the verb).

(28) I broke the glass./The glass broke. (29) I rolled the ball./The ball rolled. 52 This construction is similar to the middle, but not coextensive with it; it is "restricted and not easily tied to particular semantic classes of verbs" (Levin, 1993, p. 84). 53 Direct equivalent in French <ref> (Nicholls, 1994, p. 9) </ref>. 28 Similarly, 6.1 There Insertion applies to both types of verbs, since the construction requires them to have (or allow) an existence [;telic] or appearance [+telic] sense (Levin, 1993, pp. 89-91).

Reference-contexts: It remains to be seen, however, whether lexical aspect is indeed orthogonal to other lexical semantic properties. Since differences in lexical aspect condition different 1 The features and a cooccurrence restriction permit description of two other categories: semelfactives and stage-level states <ref> (Olsen, 1994a, p. 66) </ref>. 3 behavior in temporal frames, lexical aspect features appear to be similar to other semantic properties, as catalogued by Levin (1993). <p> In the privative model, verbs are minimally either [+dynamic] or [+durative]. Other features may be marked or left unmarked, as summarized in (1) <ref> (Olsen, 1994a, pp. 32-33) </ref>. 2 Tenny prefers the terms "delimitedness" (1995, p. 125, n.2) and "necessary internal change or motion (1995, p. 14)." 5 (1) Aspectual Class Dynamic Durative Telic Examples State + know, have Activity + + run, paint Accomplishment + + + destroy Achievement + + notice, win Semelfactives <p> + run, paint Accomplishment + + + destroy Achievement + + notice, win Semelfactives + cough, tap Stage-level states + + be sick The marked lexical aspect features are always present in the semantic representation, but features that are unmarked on the verb may become marked by other constituents 3 <ref> (Olsen, 1994a, p. 38) </ref>. The model therefore accounts for, e.g., activity verbs|marked [+dynamic, +durative]|and accomplishment verbs|marked [+dynamic, +durative, +telic]. (2) (i) Taylor ran. ACTIVITY (ii) Taylor ran a mile. <p> In categorizing the alternations, it was first determined whether the verbs undergoing the alternation were a homogeneous class with respect 3 They may also be interpreted as marked in the appropriate pragmatic context <ref> (Olsen, 1994a, p. 57) </ref>. to telicity. 4 If the verbs undergoing the alternation were all [+telic], 5 the al-ternation was classified as indicating [+telic], 6 as in the intransitive Total Transformation Alternation in (3), with verbs undergoing the alternation exhaustively listed, with respect to (Levin, 1993). 7 (3) 2.4.4 Total transformation <p> These alternations were classified as indi 4 Other lexical aspect features are briefly considered in section 6. 5 By standard tests, particularly the entailment test shown in (i)-(ii) (see <ref> (Olsen, 1994a, p. 42) </ref> for discussion). (i) John was running ENTAILS John has run. ATELIC (ii) John was winning DOES NOT ENTAIL John has won. TELIC The test is simplified here, since the privative analysis permits atelic verbs to have telic interpretations and the corresponding entailments. <p> The variant referred to by the title is illustrated by the second of the two sentences. (8) (i) 1.2.3 Understood Reflexive Object Alternation Example: Jill dressed herself./Jill dressed. 10 Hence, these verbs are [+telic] in every use, under the characterization of [+telic] in <ref> (Olsen, 1994a) </ref>. <p> [+telic] verb may become atelic, see (Smith, 1991). 11 It is also possible|here and elsewhere|that the apparent [+telic] uniformity of verbs in these alternations is an artifact of the small sample of verbs. 12 For some discussion as to why "change of state" is perhaps not an ideal term, see <ref> (Olsen, 1994a, pp. 40-41) </ref> and below. <p> In other words, these verbs do not entail a natural end (the definition of telic-ity in <ref> (Olsen, 1994a) </ref>, inter alia). In this way, correspond, meet (with), and chitchat verbs resemble degree achievements (Abusch, 1985), such as cool and thin, which also pass the telicity tests, but allow continuance of the event. <p> analysis could be extended to predict certain of the correlations of telicity, transitivity and change of state in Levin's alternations and constructions, it is not clear how it applies to, for example, the reciprocal, in which both variants are telic, but only one has a direct internal argument. 22 See <ref> (Olsen, 1994a, p. 40f) </ref> for other arguments against change of state as a lexical aspect feature. 14 of many alternations, nor atelic in the intransitive variants. Second, I show that the notion of transitivity is not uncontroversial, even if restricted to syntactic terms. <p> That is, whether the base verbs are [+telic] or [;telic], in the relevant construction (s) the predicate is [+telic]. 25 Under 25 A unification model of aspectual composition, such as that suggested in <ref> (Olsen, 1994a) </ref>, may be problematic for these constructions, since [+telic] verbs combine with [+telic] alternations to yield [+telic] predicate, without being ungrammatical for having two bounds, as with *John built a house a garage (see (Tenny, 1987) for discussion). <p> Alison dug Janice with her elbow. It is the penetration interpretation (rather than the preposition alone) upon which the telic interpretation depends. 30 These verbs alternate between state and accomplishment readings <ref> (Olsen, 1994a, p. 50) </ref>. The locatum subject reading has both interpretations: Water filled the pail may either describe the process and result or the result alone. In contrast, the non-locatum subject variant|I filled the pail with water|has only the accomplishment interpretation. <p> According to Levin (1993, p. 33), this alternation appears with "a wide range of activity verbs". The use of context to conversationally implicate a [+telic] situation is discussed in <ref> (Olsen, 1994a, pp. 42-44) </ref>. 42 The 1.4.1 Locative Preposition Drop Alternation might also be included in this category, rather than in the "holistic effect" category in (16) above, since the extent of Verb-ing is contextual, rather than evidenced by a complete change in the object: climbing a mountain requires holistic traversal <p> Joan bumped herself. This construction also exemplifies [+dynamic] situations that are not necessarily agentive (cf. <ref> (Olsen, 1994a, p. 45) </ref>). 23 semantic classes, including change-of-state, adding the notion of recipro-cal action to the basic meaning. Both variants given by Levin are telic. <p> Body-Part Possessor Ascension Alternation 2.13.1 Possessor Object 2.13.2 Attribute Object 2.13.4 Possessor Subject (transitive) 2.13.5 Possessor Subject (intransitive) 49 Found with a wider set of verbs in Italian (Levin, 1993, p. 38). 50 Direct equivalent in French (Nicholls, 1994, p. 9). 51 Although agency is often associated with [+dynamic] (see <ref> (Olsen, 1994a, p. 45) </ref> and references therein), the non-locative variant of this alternation denotes events without agents, e.g., The garden is swarming with bees (cf. <p> The locative variant, Bees swarmed in the garden, is neither telic nor holistically interpreted. Perhaps the failure of this alternation to add [+telic] with the holistic interpretation may be attributed to the [;dynamic] requirement, since states are rarely [+telic] <ref> (Olsen, 1994a, pp. 61-63) </ref>. Finally, Levin (1993, p. 62) suggests that the transitive Together 54 The touch verbs alternate between state (no effect) and accomplishment readings (effect, i.e., [+telic], implicated).
