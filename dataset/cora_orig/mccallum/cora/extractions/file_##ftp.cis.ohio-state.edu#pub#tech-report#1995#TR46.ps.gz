Abstract: Efficient allocation of communication channels is critical for the performance of wireless mobile computing systems. The centralized channel allocation algorithms proposed in literature are neither robust, nor scalable. Distributed channel allocation schemes proposed in the past are complicated and require active participation of the mobile nodes. These algorithms are unable to dynamically adjust to spatial and temporal fluctuations in channel demand (load). We present a distributed dynamic channel allocation algorithm in which heavily loaded regions are assigned a large number of communication channels, while their lightly loaded neighbors are assigned fewer channels. As the spatial distribution of channel demand changes with time, the spatial distribution of allocated channels adjusts accordingly. The algorithm described in this paper requires minimal involvement of the mobile nodes, thus conserving their limited energy supply. The algorithm is proved to be deadlock free, starvation free and fair. It prevents co-channel interference and can tolerate the failure of mobile as well as static nodes without any significant degradation in service. The algorithm is scalable and imposes low computation and communication overheads, as demonstrated by simulation experiments. fl A preliminary version of this paper [13] was presented at the 14 th ACM Symposium on Principles of Dis tributed Computing, August, 1995.

Reference-contexts: Disruptions in the performance of the algorithm, due to the failure of some M SSs, can be handled by replicating the channel allocation information in an M SS at a few other M SSs as described in <ref> [1] </ref>. Either optimistic or pessimistic information replication can be done. 19 8 Simulation Experiments and Results In Section 2 we described the system model for a mobile computing environment and in Section 4 we presented a distributed dynamic channel allocation algorithm for such an environment.

Reference-contexts: The M Hs can move from one cell to another. This architecture, first proposed in [8] is shown in Figure 1. To establish a communication session/place a call, an M H has to send a request to the M SS of the cell in which it is present <ref> [2] </ref>. The call can be supported if a wireless channel can be allocated for communication between the mobile host and the mobile service station.

Reference-contexts: Several neighboring cells may be concurrently trying to choose channels to support sessions in their region. This can lead to conflicts because the number of communication channels is limited. The resolution of such conflicts is similar to the mutual exclusion problem <ref> [3, 16] </ref>. However, the channel allocation problem is more general than the mutual exclusion problem. Firstly, a cell may be supporting multiple communication sessions, from different mobile hosts, in its region, each session using a different communication channel. <p> Firstly, a cell may be supporting multiple communication sessions, from different mobile hosts, in its region, each session using a different communication channel.

Reference-contexts: As already mentioned, the hardware cost can be reduced, while maintaining the performance, by replacing an expensive mainframe, acting as the central network switch, with inexpensive microprocessor based controllers at the mobile service stations. In <ref> [4] </ref>, channel allocation is done by the mobile host and the mobile service station working together. In mobile computing, most of the communication is in the form of several short bursts of unidirectional data transfer, with unpredictable interval between two successive bursts.

Reference-contexts: In our simulations we set THRESHOLD equal to 1. So, if the first transfer attempt fails the channel request is dropped. 8.2 Simulation Results We assumed the average duration of communication sessions (1=) to be 3 minutes, identical to that used in <ref> [5, 20, 21] </ref>. Simulation experiments were done for three different values of N , the number of communication channels in the Spectrum: 50, 100, and 400.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Mobile computing has found increased applications and gained importance in recent years <ref> [6] </ref>. Mobile computing makes use of cellular/wireless communication networks to provide communication among stationary and mobile hosts. In such environments, efficient allocation of wireless channels for communication sessions is of vital importance as the bandwidth alloted for cellular communication is limited.

Reference-contexts: However, to maintain continuity of service, the resultant channel allocation for hand-off should be assigned higher priority than requests for new communication sessions. Two priority schemes for hand-offs have been proposed and evaluated in <ref> [7] </ref>. 3 Channel Allocation vs. Mutual Exclusion In the context of a cell and its neighbors, the use of a particular channel to support a communication session is equivalent to a critical section execution by the cell in which the channel is being used. <p> Such a disruption is referred to as hand-off failure. Two priority based hand-off strategies have been proposed in <ref> [7] </ref>. These strategies can be easily incorporated in the algorithm described in Section 4. The two strategies are: 1. Channel Reservation: a certain number of channels (H) are reserved exclusively for hand-offs. Any available channel in the target cell can be used to support handed-off communication sessions. <p> This is to ensure that hand-offs, if possible, are done fast enough so that the disruption in the communication session during hand-off is not noticeable. Simulation results in <ref> [7] </ref> show that both the strategies reduce the hand-off failure probability significantly. However, the first strategy leads to a corresponding increase in the probability of new channel requests being dropped. Hence, the hand-off queuing strategy appears to be the better of the two strategies.

Reference-contexts: The mobile service stations are connected to each other by a fixed wire network. Several mobile hosts (MH) may be present in a cell. The M Hs can move from one cell to another. This architecture, first proposed in <ref> [8] </ref> is shown in Figure 1. To establish a communication session/place a call, an M H has to send a request to the M SS of the cell in which it is present [2].

Reference-contexts: The central switch ensures that the borrowing does not lead to any co-channel interference. In a Hybrid Channel Assignment strategy <ref> [9] </ref>, the nominal channels assigned to a cell are made up of two sets: one that can only be used locally, and the other that can be borrowed by neighboring cells. Paper Objective In this paper we present a distributed, dynamic channel allocation algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Firstly, a cell may be supporting multiple communication sessions, from different mobile hosts, in its region, each session using a different communication channel. This is equivalent to a cell being in multiple, distinct critical sections concurrently. Secondly, existing mutual exclusion algorithms for distributed systems <ref> [3, 10, 12, 14, 16] </ref> assume that a node specifies the identity 7 of the resource it wants to access in a critical section. Depending on the availability of that resource, appropriate decisions can be made. <p> This is a trade-off that has to be accepted. 4 A Dynamic Channel Allocation Algorithm In the proposed algorithm, a mobile service station makes all the channel allocation decisions on behalf of the mobile hosts in its cell. Requests timestamped with Lamport's clock <ref> [10] </ref> are sent by a mobile service station to neighboring mobile service stations to determine the channel to be assigned for a communication session. <p> This enables the algorithm to adapt to 8 temporal and spatial changes in load distribution. It also helps reduce the traffic due to channel allocation requests in the fixed wire network. 4.1 Lamport's Logical Clocks In this section, we give a brief description of Lamport's logical clocks <ref> [10] </ref> as the proposed algorithm makes use of this clock system to totally order the requests for channels among neighboring cells. Under this clock system, every process P i maintains a clock T i . <p> Transfer sets are initially empty at all the cells. T i is the clock value maintained at cell C i as per the Lamport's logical clock <ref> [10] </ref>. Initially, T i is zero at every cell. RT i is the timestamp of the current channel request. If RT i is equal to zero, then cell C i is not requesting a channel. Initially RT i is equal to zero.

Reference-contexts: This leads to significant energy savings at the mobile host. Channel allocation strategies that constantly monitor the signal-to-interference ratio of channels, and employ cell sectoring [17] or cell overlaying <ref> [11] </ref> have been proposed. However, these strategies are complex to implement and have a higher probability of needing hand-offs [19]. In addition to inter-cell hand-offs, intra-cell hand-offs may be needed. For example, when cell sectoring is employed, a cell is divided into multiple sectors.

Reference-contexts: Its performance should degrade gracefully as channel demand increases and it should be scalable. In order to quantitatively measure the performance of the proposed algorithm, we conducted several simulation experiments. A process-oriented, discrete-event simulation using CSIM <ref> [15] </ref> was developed for this purpose. 8.1 Simulation Environment Three important aspects of the simulation environment are the channel reuse pattern, communication and computation characteristics, and channel demand distribution. 8.1.1 Channel Reuse Pattern We assumed a 7fi7 grid of hexagonal cells, as shown in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: These 49 cells form a 3-cell cluster system. A 3-cell cluster system has the following properties: if a channel is being used to support a communication session in a cell, it cannot be used concurrently in the immediate neighboring cells <ref> [18] </ref>. However, the same channel can be used at a distance of two cells. For example, in Figure 2, a channel can be used concurrently in cells 24 and 26, but not concurrently in cells 24 and 25 or 25 and 26.

Reference-contexts: Each cell can use only its set of channels (the nominal channels of the cell) to support the calls originating from and/or directed towards the mobile hosts in its region. 2.
