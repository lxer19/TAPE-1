Abstract: This paper introduces a subclass of Hamiltonian control systems motivated by mechanical models. Some problems of time-optimal control are studied, and results on singular trajectories are obtained.

Reference-contexts: More broadly, many questions other than optimal control can be studied for our subclass of Hamiltonian systems. 9 7 Appendix We review here some basic terminology regarding Hamiltonian systems. Our main references are <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]. A symplectic manifold consists of a differentiable manifold together with a closed (d! 2 = 0) nondegenerate 2-form ! 2 . This form induces a skew-symmetric pairing on the tangent bundle of M , which allows the identification of tangent vectors with one-forms. <p> dt This definition also implies that for all t where the flow e tX H 0 (x) is defined, d H e tX H 0 (x) = fH ffi e tX H 0 ; H 0 g and also that dfH; H 0 g = fdH; dH 0 g (see <ref> [1] </ref>, section II.3.3). The Poisson bracket satisfies the Jacobi identity: ad H fH 0 ; H 00 g = fad H H 0 ; H 00 g + fH 0 ; ad H H 00 g ; where one denotes ad H K := fH; Kg. <p> the familiar form _p = @q @H 10 and the Poisson bracket of H and H 0 becomes fH; H 0 g (x) = i=1 @p i @q i @H 0 @H : A more general version of Darboux' Theorem can be obtained from a result due to Lie (see <ref> [1] </ref>, Corollary II.5.3.31), and it says that if H 1 ; ; H k are functions whose Hamiltonian flows commute, that is, so that fH i ; H j g = 0 for all i 6= j, and if their differentials dH 1 ; ; dH k are pointwise linearly independent,

Reference-contexts: functions: f = X H 0 ; g i = X H i ; i = 1::m : It may be of interest to weaken this definition and allow f to be only locally Hamilto-nian as done in [4], or to consider what are sometimes called "Poisson systems" (see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>). But we wish here to instead restrict this class further by imposing five conditions, the first four of which follow and the last of which will be given later.

Reference-contexts: We start here with the definition of Hamiltonian control system as in <ref> [4] </ref>, but not introducing outputs. The systems that we consider are of the type _x (t) = f (x (t)) + i=1 where f; g 1 ; :::; g m are smooth vector fields on the ndimensional manifold M . <p> IR so that the vector fields of are those associated to these functions: f = X H 0 ; g i = X H i ; i = 1::m : It may be of interest to weaken this definition and allow f to be only locally Hamilto-nian as done in <ref> [4] </ref>, or to consider what are sometimes called "Poisson systems" (see e.g. [3]). But we wish here to instead restrict this class further by imposing five conditions, the first four of which follow and the last of which will be given later. <p> Our goal here is to show how some conclusions can be drawn for multiple input systems if (A1)-(A5) are assumed. 4 3.1 Pontryagin's Maximum Principle In order to elegantly state the PMP, we introduce first the Hamiltonian extension (or lift) fl of the system (see e.g. <ref> [4] </ref> for more details). The state space of fl is T fl M seen as symplectic manifold. Note that in our applications, M is itself a symplectic manifold, but for now we do not use that fact.

Reference-contexts: In fact, in this case, one can find Riccati-type equations for controls, as discussed for manipulators in <ref> [5] </ref>. It could be the case, of course, that everything degenerates. For instance, when det fl k 0 then R k = ;. This can happen in turn if some row of fl k , say the ith one, vanishes identically. <p> On the other hand, for k = 1 one has R 2 = fx j 2 6= 2 and therefore For u 1 -singular trajectories, there are no switches on R 2 . Moreover, one can prove as in <ref> [5] </ref> that indeed there do exist such trajectories, through each point in R 2 . One can also apply higher-order tests for optimality, in order to eliminate singular trajectories which are not necessarily optimal. We illustrate this with the 2-link manipulator.

Reference-contexts: The main results characterize regions of the state space where singular trajectories cannot exist, and provide high-order conditions for optimality. This work was motivated by previous studies ([5], <ref> [6] </ref>) on robotic manipulators. Pursuing further the ideas expressed in [6], we identify a class of Hamiltonian systems which includes many mechanical models, particularly those in which the energy is at most quadratic in the momenta. <p> The main results characterize regions of the state space where singular trajectories cannot exist, and provide high-order conditions for optimality.

This work is only preliminary, in that more questions are left open than are answered. <p> In that case, however, it will follow from (6) that second derivatives also vanish identically, and this allows a third derivative condition to be imposed. 8 5.1 Example For a 2-link rotational manipulator (see equations in <ref> [6] </ref>), one computes (using a symbolic system): ff ij1 0 8i; j fl 2 = 2 = ff 112 = ( 2 ) sin 2 2 as well as S 2 = fx j -( 2 )( _ 1 + _ 2 ) sin 2 = 0g for some everywhere negative
