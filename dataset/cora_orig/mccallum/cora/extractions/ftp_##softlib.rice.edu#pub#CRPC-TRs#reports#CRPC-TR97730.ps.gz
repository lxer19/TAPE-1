Abstract: Recently primal-dual interior-point methodology has proven to be an effective tool in linear programming applications and is now being extended, with great enthusiasm to general nonlinear programming applications. The primary purpose of this current study is to develop and promote the belief that since Newton's method is a tool for square nonlinear systems of equations, the fundamental role of interior-point methodology in inequality constrained optimization is to produce, in a meaningful and effective manner, a square system of nonlinear equations that represents the inequality constrained optimization problem sufficiently well that the application of Newton's method methodology to this square system is effective and successful.

Reference-contexts: El-Bakry et al [2] did not consider the flexibility of holding fixed for an appropriate number of Newton iterations. This flexibility is a major theme in Gonzalez-Lima, Tapia, and Potra [5] in a particular linear programming application, and is also a major theme in Argaez and Tapia <ref> [1] </ref>. We have now arrived to the point that is the underlying tenet of the current study. The primal-dual Newton interior-point method consists of Newton steps on a square nonlinear system of equations, the perturbed KKT conditions (4.32), that has in no way compromised complementarity.

Reference-contexts: Our present task is to interpret the primal-dual interior-point Newton approach, proposed by Kojima, Mizuno, and Yoshise [7] in 1989 for linear programming and extended to nonlinear programming by El-Bakry, Tapia, Tsuchiya, and Zhang <ref> [2] </ref> in 1992, in the context of both existing literature and the interior-point challenge described immediately above. <p> To begin with eventhough the KKT conditions for the logarithmic barrier function subproblem (4.29) and the perturbed KKT conditions (4.32) are equivalent; the Newton steps for the two systems are in general quite different. Indeed, in the case of linear programming El-Bakry, Tapia, Tsuchiya, and Zhang <ref> [2] </ref> proved that the two Newton steps are never the same. Hence in nonlinear programming we should expect similar behavior, with perhaps some pathological exceptions. <p> However, can be changed more frequently in the Newton iteration process when appropriate, i.e., certainly near the solution, in an effort to obtain a more efficient implementation. El-Bakry et al <ref> [2] </ref> did not consider the flexibility of holding fixed for an appropriate number of Newton iterations. This flexibility is a major theme in Gonzalez-Lima, Tapia, and Potra [5] in a particular linear programming application, and is also a major theme in Argaez and Tapia [1]. <p> Zhang and Tapia [13] were able to extend this result to degenerate linear programs. This is a surprising result since the Jacobian matrix at a solution may be highly singular and quadratic convergence for singular Newton's method is extremely rare. El-Bakry et. al <ref> [2] </ref> demonstrated quadratic convergence in the case of nonlinear programming under the standard Newton's method theory assumptions. 16 Why Perturb the KKT Conditions Let us consider the complementarity equation for a particular variable say x i .

Reference-contexts: Moreover, these disadvantages must speak directly to the fact that the simplex method for linear programming is known not to be a polynomial time algorithm. The now famous Klee-Minty <ref> [6] </ref> counterexample forces the simplex method to consider each vertex. 3.3 Logarithmic Barrier Function Interior-Point Method The basic idea of the logarithmic barrier function method is to replace the optimization problem minimize f (x) subject to h (x) = 0 g (x) 0 11 with the equality constrained optimization problem minimize

Reference-contexts: The introduction of extraneous multiple solutions causes the global convergence of Newton's method to deteriorate significantly. The first disadvantage is not particularly serious, and can actually be circumvented by a decoupling procedure described in Tapia <ref> [11] </ref>. The second disadvantage is serious and of 9 concern. However, the third disadvantage is devastating and effectively renders the squared--slack variable approach useless, as a numerical tool. To further understand this highly critical statement, we add the following explanation.

Reference-contexts: So, in contrast to an active set approach, in our primal-dual Newton interior-point approach, under mild assumptions, we know that if the sequence of iterates converges, then it converges to a KKT point of the original problem. Moreover, Zhang, Tapia and Dennis <ref> [12] </ref> demonstrated that quadratic convergence could be obtained from the primal-dual interior-point method for nondegenerate linear programs. Zhang and Tapia [13] were able to extend this result to degenerate linear programs.
