Title: A Computing Environment for Spatial Data Analysis in the Microelectronics Industry  
Author: Mark H. Hansen and David A. James 
Date: December 6, 1996  
Address: Murray Hill  
Affiliation: Statistics and Information Analysis Bell Laboratories,  
Abstract: This paper describes a computing environment called S-wafers tailored for the analysis of spatial data collected during semiconductor manufacturing processes. At the core of S-wafers lies a new statistical methodology that systematically exploits the basic spatial nature of these data. S-wafers builds on the experience of Lucent Technologies Microelectronics engineers and Bell Laboratories researchers who have noticed that patterns in mapped wafer data can provide "signatures" that can be used to help identify and correct process problems. The S-wafers environment provides the means to formalize these observations into implementable strategies by providing extensive tools for data visualization, the identification of groups of similarly patterned wafers, the spatial analysis of designed experiments, the assessment of the impact of particle contamination, and much more. In addition to supporting statistical research into problems of process improvement in this area, S-wafers has been used for over two years by various groups in Lucent Technologies Microelectronics Division. Extensions to both the software environment and the underlying statistical methodology continue at a fast pace.
