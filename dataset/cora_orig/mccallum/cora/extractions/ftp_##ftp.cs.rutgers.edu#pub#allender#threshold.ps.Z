Abstract: We show that the permanent cannot be computed by uniform constant-depth threshold circuits of size T(n), for any function T such that for all k, T (k) (n) = o(2 n ). More generally, we show that any problem that is hard for the complexity class C = P requires circuits of this size (on the uniform constant-depth threshold circuit model). In particular, this lower bound applies to any problem that is hard for the complexity classes PP or #P. This extends a recent result by Caussinus, McKenzie, Therien, and Vollmer [CMTV96], showing that there are problems in the counting hierarchy that require superpolynomial-size uniform TC 0 circuits. The proof in [CMTV96] uses "leaf languages" as a tool in obtaining their separations, and their proof does not immediately yield larger lower bounds for the complexity of these problems, and it also does not yield a lower bound for any particular problem at any fixed level of the counting hierarchy. (It only shows that hard problems must exist at some level of the counting hierarchy.) We also present related and somewhat weaker lower bounds, extending the theorem of [CMTV96] showing that ACC 0 is properly con tained in ModPH.

Reference-contexts: In this algebraic setting, ACC 0 is the most important subclass of NC 1 .

In contrast to our lack of lower bounds for nonuniform ACC 0 circuits for sets in NTIME (2 n O (1) ), it was shown in <ref> [AG94] </ref> that exponential size (i.e., size at least 2 n * ) is required to compute the permanent (and other problems complete for #P) on uniform ACC 0 circuits. Thus there are sets in P #P that require exponential-sized uniform ACC 0 circuits. <p> C = P contains coNP but is not known to contain NP; PP is contained in NP C = P [Tor91]. One might expect that similar exponential lower bounds would hold for PP or C = P as hold for #P, but <ref> [AG94] </ref> was able only to show that sets complete for these classes require more than "sub-subexponential" size ACC 0 circuits, where the term "sub-subexponential" is made precise as follows: Definition 1 A function t is said to be sub-subexponential if 8k; t (t (n) k ) = 2 n o (1) <p> able only to show that sets complete for these classes require more than "sub-subexponential" size ACC 0 circuits, where the term "sub-subexponential" is made precise as follows: Definition 1 A function t is said to be sub-subexponential if 8k; t (t (n) k ) = 2 n o (1) (In <ref> [AG94] </ref> this term was defined slightly differently; in that paper, t had only to satisfy the condition that t (t (n)) = 2 n o (1) . <p> Corollary 1.1 The permanent cannot be computed by uniform constant-depth threshold circuits of size t (n), if for all k; t (k) (n) = o (2 n ).

Reference-contexts: Different notions of "sufficiently easy" give rise to different notions of uniformity, and the question of which notion of uniformity is the "right" one to use when studying classes of circuits is not always clear. For the circuit classes considered here, convincing arguments are presented in <ref> [BIS90] </ref>, arguing that a very restrictive notion of uniformity called Dlogtime-uniformity is the correct 2 notion to use. <p> the length of the input (n; g; h) is logarithmic in the size of the circuit C n . (Dlogtime-uniformity is essentially equivalent to what Ruzzo called U E uniformity in [Ruz81]; although he considered only circuits of fan-in two, and not the unbounded fan-in circuits considered here and in <ref> [BIS90] </ref>.) Throughout the rest of this paper, all mention of uniform circuits refers to Dlogtime-uniform circuits. In this paper, ACC 0 (S (n)) will denote the class of languages with uniform ACC 0 circuits of size S (n). ACC 0 denotes ACC 0 (n O (1) ). <p> TC 0 captures the complexity of important 3 natural computational problems such as sorting, counting, and integer multipli-cation. It is also a good complexity-theoretic model for the "neural net" model of computation [Par90].

Reference-contexts: The techniques of [AG94] (see also [II96]) use diagonalization, which is less useful in the nonuniform setting. Since our results, like those of <ref> [CMTV96] </ref> and [AG94], concern uniform circuits, it is necessary to briefly discuss uniformity. A circuit family fC n g consists of a circuit for each input length n. If C n is "sufficiently easy" to construct from n, then the family fC n g is said to be uniform. <p> 2, we present models of computation (similar to alternating Turing machines) such that polynomial time on this model characterizes ModPH (or the counting hierarchy) while logarithmic time characterizes ACC 0 (or TC 0 , respectively). 1.2 Statement of the Main Results A recent paper by Caussinus, McKenzie, Therien, and Vollmer <ref> [CMTV96] </ref> shows that ACC 0 is properly contained in ModPH, and TC 0 is properly contained in the counting hierarchy. The proof given by [CMTV96] uses "leaf languages" as a tool, and does not explicitly present a lower bound for any language in ModPH or in the counting hierarchy. <p> while logarithmic time characterizes ACC 0 (or TC 0 , respectively). 1.2 Statement of the Main Results A recent paper by Caussinus, McKenzie, Therien, and Vollmer <ref> [CMTV96] </ref> shows that ACC 0 is properly contained in ModPH, and TC 0 is properly contained in the counting hierarchy. The proof given by [CMTV96] uses "leaf languages" as a tool, and does not explicitly present a lower bound for any language in ModPH or in the counting hierarchy. The present work began as an attempt to discover if these techniques could be used to present an explicit lower bound. <p> This attempt was only partially successful. For each given language A in ModPH, it is still an open question if A has polynomial size uniform ACC 0 circuits. The proof in <ref> [CMTV96] </ref> shows only that there exists a set in ModPH that requires superpolynomial size ACC 0 circuits; the present work gives a very simple direct proof of this same separation, but with the improvement that "superpolynomial" is replaced by "sub-subexponential". <p> * ) [ TC 0 (n O (log fl n) ). (By essentially the same argument, we obtain that TC 0 is properly contained in NC 1 [TC 0 (n O (log fl n) ).) We immediately get the following corollaries, which seem only marginally better than the results of <ref> [CMTV96] </ref> showing proper inclusion in ModPH and the counting hierarchy: Corollary 6.3 Let * be greater than 0. Then: ACC 0 is properly contained in ACC 0 (2 n * ). TC 0 is properly contained in TC 0 (2 n * ). <p> In [AG94] we presented lower bounds on the uniform circuit complexity of certain problems in PSPACE, and did not see any way to prove lower bounds on the ACC 0 circuit complexity of any given problem in ModPH. Given the inspiration of <ref> [CMTV96] </ref>, it is easy to give a direct proof showing that there exist sets in ModPH having large ACC 0 circuit complexity, without giving lower bounds on any specific set in ModPH. <p> 0 is a very limited class in many respects (and in particular it is not clear that one should expect pseudorandom generators to be computable in ACC 0 ), it is not clear that lower bounds for ACC 0 should be hard to obtain.)

Reference-contexts: There are well-studied subclasses of PSPACE that correspond in a natural way to the complexity classes AC 0 , ACC 0 , and TC 0 .

One way to present this correspondence is to observe that, when one considers alternating Turing machines that make only O (1) alternations, a polynomial running time yields the polynomial hierarchy, while a logarithmic running time yields uniform AC 0 .

Reference-contexts: 7 The lower bounds presented in this paper do not depend on this tape reduc-tion, but the statement of Theorem 3.1 is simplified by taking advantage of the tape reduction. 3 Diagonalization It is important to note that the techniques used to prove the nondeterministic time hierarchy (originally proved in <ref> [SFM78] </ref>, although we will use the very simple and general version proved by Zak [ Z83]) can be used to prove analogous hierarchies for other computational models defined in terms of nondeterministic Turing machines (with a fixed bound on the number of worktapes).

Reference-contexts: It is known that constant-depth circuits of AND, OR, and NOT gates (so-called AC 0 circuits) require exponential size even to compute the parity of n input bits [H-as87, Yao85], and similar lower bounds are known for constant-depth circuits of AND, OR, NOT, and MODp gates where p is prime <ref> [Raz87, Smo87] </ref>. When MODm gates are allowed for composite m, however, almost nothing is known. It remains an open question if there is any problem in NTIME (2 n O (1) ) that cannot be done with polynomial size and constant depth with AND and MOD6 gates.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the functions that are shown by Toda in <ref> [Tod94] </ref> to be complete for FP #P are not immediately known to require large threshold circuits; it would first need to be established that they are hard for C = P under TC 0 reductions. 2 Machine Models We assume the reader is familiar with nondeterministic oracle Turing machines.

Reference-contexts: Thus Theorem 5.1 applies. 2 In contrast, some of the functions that are shown to be #P-complete in <ref> [Val79] </ref> are shown only to be complete under poly-time Turing reducibility; for example, we have not checked to see if the problem of counting the number of (possibly imperfect) matchings in a bipartite graph is hard for C = P under TC 0 T reducibility (although we suspect that this is

Reference-contexts: The analogous subclasses of PSPACE corresponding to ACC 0 and TC 0 are ModPH, and the counting hierarchy, respectively. ModPH is in some sense a generalization of the polynomial hierarchy and of P (formal definitions appear in Section 2). The counting hierarchy (defined in <ref> [Wag86] </ref> and studied by several authors) consists of the union of the complexity classes PP, PP PP , PP PP PP , : : : (Note that this is equal to the union of the classes C = P, C = P C = P , C = P C =

Reference-contexts: Then A TC 0 T B if there is a uniform family of polynomial-size constant depth circuits with MAJORITY gates and oracle gates for B, accepting A. (This is a natural adaptation of the notion of AC 0 reducibility studied in <ref> [Wil90] </ref> and elsewhere.) In particular, all sets that are currently known to be complete for PP require threshold circuits of this size, because all such sets currently known are in fact complete under many-one reductions computable in uniform AC 0 .

Reference-contexts: Yet even in the study of constant-depth circuits one quickly arrives at the limits of current lower-bound technology. It is known that constant-depth circuits of AND, OR, and NOT gates (so-called AC 0 circuits) require exponential size even to compute the parity of n input bits <ref> [H-as87, Yao85] </ref>, and similar lower bounds are known for constant-depth circuits of AND, OR, NOT, and MODp gates where p is prime [Raz87, Smo87].

Reference-contexts: Corollary 1.1 The permanent cannot be computed by uniform constant-depth threshold circuits of size t (n), if for all k; t (k) (n) = o (2 n ). Proof: It was shown in <ref> [Zan91] </ref> (see also comments in [AG94]), that the set f (x; i; b) j the ith bit of Permanent (x) is equal to bg is hard for C = P under AC 0 reducibility (with only one query).
