Abstract: We propose that the Telescope Array, now under R&D, may be the best choice for the fluorescence detector to be installed in the northern or southern hemisphere together with a giant surface array. Not only does the Telescope Array satisfy the requirements of an optimal atmospheric fluorescence detector to work in conjunction with the giant ground array as outlined by P. Sommers at the midterm workshop, but it can also produce many other important physics results, even during the construction period.

Reference-contexts: Such gamma-rays are late developed due to the LPM effect and may be identified by their longitudinal development curves (for example, <ref> [4] </ref>). 3.

According to the simulations of Kawaguchi [5], Dedenko and others [6], such showers may be subject to the LPM effect and hence late developed.

Reference-contexts: Such a cut-off is expected in the range 50GeV ~ 1000GeV for EGRET sources due to the acceleration limit or interaction of gamma-rays with infrared photons in intergalactic space. Determining the cut-off energy may be successful only with a multi-mirror experiment <ref> [9] </ref>. * To reduce the threshold energies of gamma-ray detection to increase source candidates, signals from the same direction from many mirrors may be added, since the tracking accuracy of mir ror directions are expected to be within 0.1 ffi . * To cover the whole sky to look for new
