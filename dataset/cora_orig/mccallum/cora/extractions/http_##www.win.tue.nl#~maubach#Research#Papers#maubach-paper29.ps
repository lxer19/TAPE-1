Abstract: Every n-simplex of an n-dimensional finite element grid determines the entries of a related element matrix A e . The coefficient matrix A of the resulting system of equations can be written as the sum A= P e A e over all grid simplices e. The order of each A e depends on the polynomial interpolation degree. In n dimensions, the standard conforming degree k polynomial interpolation involves a combinatorially fast growing amount of basis functions. Thus, high order finite element approximations involve a coefficient matrix with a considerable amount of non-zero entries. For a fixed amount of computer memory, this large amount of entries limits the size of the computational grid and therefore the solution details which can be resolved. This paper is based on the bisection type refinement method introduced in [27]. First, it generalizes the main descendant representation theorem from [27] to grids which contain arbitrarily shaped simplices. Next, for an arbitrarily shaped simplex it proves that precisely s=n2 n n!=4 different non-similar descendants are created, independent of the amount of applied bisections. This shows that the refinement from [27] can resolve very small solution details. For a coarse grid

The refinement of [27] is applicable to any dimension. Applications in four dimensions include relativity (gravity waves).

Reference-contexts: The key is to take advantage of the similarity between individual grid elements. For every grid simplex e a finite element matrix A e contributes to the global system of equations Ax = b, (Axelsson and Barker <ref> [4] </ref>). The order m of A e typically depends on the polynomial interpolation degree. In n dimensions, the standard conforming degree k polynomial interpolation involves m = i k basis functions.

However, all presented results are original to this paper. Contrary to [27], they are for arbitrarily shaped n-simplices and based on the new and different descendant representation Theorem 4.1. Section 6 provides two three-dimensional and other applications of the of the n-bisection refinement. <p> The conclusions in Section 7 are followed by a list of references. 2 The coarse grid hypothesis This section introduces the new coarse grid hypothesis. This hypothesis is much weaker than, and relaxes, all conditions previously required by the n-bisection refinement in <ref> [27] </ref>. The introduced notations and lemmas facilitate the new descendant representation theorem, the related similarity class count and examples in Section 3. First, n-simplices are introduced, and associated with rows of vertices. Immediately afterwards, the new coarse n-simplicial grid hypothesis is formulated. <p> p+1 = o 1 o 2 o p whence sign (oe p ) is equal to 1 1p mod 2 . 3 Coarse grids which satisfy the hypothesis This section demonstrates that the new hypothesis formulated in Section 2 holds for important frequently used n-simplicial grids, including all grids from <ref> [27] </ref>. All grids are coarse and ff = 1=2. In [1], Allgower and Georg demonstrate that the simplex collection C = fEg 2S n compatibly covers the unit n-cube [0; 1] n . For n = 3, where 6 = 3! tetrahedra cover [0; 1] 3 , see Figure 3.1. <p> The J 1 grid satisfies the hypothesis. Example: Theorem 3.3 correctly claims that neighbor 0 of J 1 -simplex [3; 1] &gt; + R [1;0] &gt; (1 2) in + R [2;0] &gt;(1 2) We now present some example grids which do not satify the conditions required in <ref> [27] </ref>, but which do satify the current new hypothesis. First, consider the 5-cover shown in Figures 3.2 and 3.3a. It is the minimum simplicial cover of [0; 1] 3 according to [25]. <p> All edges of the central tetrahedron T 0 : (x 1 ; x 2 ; x 4 ; x 7 ) have length p conditions in <ref> [27] </ref> are not satisfied because T 0 can not be generated by bisection from a K 1 or J 1 grid. <p> This grid satisfies the hypothesis for every number of tetrahedra. In generality, it can not be generated from a K 1 or J 1 grid with the n-bisection refinement method. Therefore, it which does not satisfy all requirements formulated in <ref> [27] </ref>. Finally, for n = 2, the hypothesis is sufficient but not necessary. <p> However, for n = 2, the n-bisection method is equivalent to Mitchell's method from [28], which can be succesfully applied to any coarse grid. 4 The descendant representation theorem This section presents the n-bisection step, first introduced for ff = 1=2 in <ref> [27] </ref>, and calls it ff-bisection step. It studies the affine maps related to descendants created by repeated bisection. The hypothesis allows for arbitrarily shaped coarse grid simplices.

As a non-trivial spin-off, the new amount of similarity classes is calculated in Theorem 4.3. Theorem 4.2 is used by the refinement algorithm in section 5. <p> The bisected simplex is called parent, and the two created simplices are called its immediate descendants. For the remainder of this paper, every simplex is assumed to be a descendant of itself. The union of the two immediate descendants is their parent, based on references from <ref> [27] </ref>. A descendant is uniquely determined by a row of numbers, each zero (choose first descendant), or one (choose the second descendant). <p> It prevents the creation of degenerate simplices as shown in Theorems 4.1 and 4.2. local n-simplicial bisection refinement 19 Theorem 4.1 from <ref> [27] </ref> only provides a characterization of all 1=2-descendants, and only for a J 1 simplex of type c+R u E. Below, for levels restricted to f0; : : : ; ng, Theorem 4.1 ensures descendants of arbitrarily shaped simplices will not be degenerate. <p> Thesis [29] by Mukherjee quotes from Arnold and Pouly [2], who suggest an upperbound of n n!2 n2 similarity classes for the 1=2-bisection step, and prove this bound is sharp for the case n = 3. Here, we extend the descendant representation from <ref> [27] </ref> from a special case to arbitrary simplices. As a derived result we prove the exact amount of similarity classes for any dimension n is n n!2 n =4. All future descendants' angles can be exactly computed in advance. <p> Table 4.2 # Similarity Classes. n l #E #C 3 6 187 36 5 16 37435 4800 The situation was different in <ref> [27] </ref> because structured K 1 and J 1 simplices only lead to n similarity classes.

However, local refinement is only possible with additional closure bisection, which creates many more non-similar simplices. <p> Regular refinement into 2 n descendants as in [12] may create less similarity classes. However, local refinement is only possible with additional closure bisection, which creates many more non-similar simplices. For n = 3, see [9]. 5 The refinement algorithm In this section we introduce the refinement algorithm from <ref> [27] </ref>. The hypothesis is shown to facilitate this algorithm, and to be invariant under its application. If it is satisfied by a coarse grid, then it is also local n-simplicial bisection refinement 35 satisfied by all derived refined grids. The refinement algorithm is made possible by Lemma 5.1. <p> This lemma also ensures that the refinement algorithm terminates and does not create incompatibilities. Two simplices are called compatibly bisectable if their intersection is empty or if application of the bisection step to both, bisects the same edge in a shared face. The refinement algorithm from <ref> [27] </ref> naturally prevents grid incompatibilities: Refine (T): BEGIN WHILE Neighbor T 0 is not compatibly bisectable DO Refine (T 0 ); END; Bisect (T); FOR each neighbor T 0 : DO Bisect (T 0 ); END; Direct examination of the refinement algorithm reveals two steps. <p> If such a simplex T 0 is not compatibly bisectable, the algorithm is first applied recursively to T 0 , after which one of its children will be compatibly bisectable with T . Theorem 5.1 from <ref> [27] </ref> shows that a not compatibly bisectable neighbor is of one level lower than T . This reduces the compatibility problem to a coarse grid problem. In the second step, all simplices T 0 which share the edge with T are compatibly bisectable, and simultaneously bisected. Theorem 5.1 of paper [27], <p> <ref> [27] </ref> shows that a not compatibly bisectable neighbor is of one level lower than T . This reduces the compatibility problem to a coarse grid problem. In the second step, all simplices T 0 which share the edge with T are compatibly bisectable, and simultaneously bisected. Theorem 5.1 of paper [27], based on representation theorem Theorem 4.1 of [27], shows that this algorithm works for a structured K 1 grid. Its main results are summarized in Lemma 5.1 below. They remain valid under the new representation theorem Theorem 4.2. <p> This reduces the compatibility problem to a coarse grid problem. In the second step, all simplices T 0 which share the edge with T are compatibly bisectable, and simultaneously bisected. Theorem 5.1 of paper <ref> [27] </ref>, based on representation theorem Theorem 4.1 of [27], shows that this algorithm works for a structured K 1 grid. Its main results are summarized in Lemma 5.1 below. They remain valid under the new representation theorem Theorem 4.2. <p> The non-compatibily bisectable neighbor is of one level less. If T 0 is bisected, one of its children will share a face with T which contains T 's edge to be bisected and be compatibily bisectable with T . Proof. The proof of <ref> [27] </ref>, Theorem 5.1 involves exactly 2 assumptions. (1) Neighbors which share a face with the edge to be bisected have n out of n + 1 vertices in common; (2) The anisotropic scalings used in Theorem 4.1 from [27] on page 217 occur in subsequent directions e n ; : : <p> Proof.

Needless to say, assumption (1) is valid. <p> All simplices of the K 1 and J 1 grids are proven to be compatibly bisectable in <ref> [27] </ref>. The simplices in the minimal 5-cover are also all compatibly bisectable: the simplices T 0 , T 2 and T 3 share the edge to be bisected, and the `by reflection defined' neighbors of T 1 and T 4 in adjacent cubes also share the edge to be bisected. <p> Few non-similar finite element matrices allow the global coefficient matrix to be stored as a small collection of non-similar finite element matrices. The decomposition of a volume [0; 1] n into an arbitrary amount of few non-similar volumes allows for an efficient fractal image decomposition (see [20] based on <ref> [27] </ref>). local n-simplicial bisection refinement 37 Fig. 6.1 An adaptively refined grid with only 1 similarity class. element solution is of polynomial degree 5 over each individual triangle.

Reference-contexts: Two well-known examples are the compatible K 1 and J 1 grids. The K 1 type grids are due to Kuhn and later Freudentahl (see Todd [36]), the J 1 grids are originally from Tucker <ref> [37] </ref> and afterwards Whitney [38]. Without loss of generalization, we assume d i 2 N. Define D = f0; : : : ; d 1 1g fi f0; : : : ; d n 1g, assume 2 S n , R u 2 R n and i 2 D.

Reference-contexts: Thus, o p is orthogonal (see also [19], Section 5.3). Because every 2 S n is a product of transpositions (see Wielandt <ref> [39] </ref>, Chapter 1) we find that every permutation is an orthogonal map, and therefore, a similarity map. Hence, S n ae M O . In the sequel, an edge between two predetermined points x; y 2 R n is bisected, potentially off-center.
