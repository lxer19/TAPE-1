Abstract: Several metrics are used in empirical studies to explore the mechanisms of convergence of genetic algorithms. The metric is designed to measure the consistency of an arbitrary ranking of hyperplanes in a partition with respect to a target string. Walsh coefficients can be calculated for small functions in order to characterize sources of linear and nonlinear interactions. A simple deception measure is also developed to look closely at the effects of increasing nonlinearity of functions. Correlations between the metric and deception measure are discussed and relationships between and convergence behavior of a simple genetic algorithm are studied over large sets of functions with varying degrees of nonlinearity.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A recurring theme in Holland's 1975 book is that genetic algorithms process schemata. One of the ways they do that is by ranking schemata in the population according to their usefulness. Whitley et al. <ref> [4] </ref> developed a metric which can be used to measure the consistency of an ordered set of hyperplanes in a partition with respect to a specified target string. <p> Whitley et al. <ref> [4] </ref> show that during the first few generations of a genetic algorithm the dynamic ranking of the hyperplanes in any partition, measured in terms of their proportional representation in the population, is highly correlated with the average hyperplane fitness measured over all strings in each hyperplane. <p> To this end we introduce the spectrum metric. This is a measure of with respect to all points in the search space using the static ranking of hyperplanes based on the fitness function. Instead of using randomly generated functions (as Whitley et al. <ref> [4] </ref>), we look at functions with differing degrees of nonlinearity created using Walsh coefficients [1, 2] and measure the distribution of the nonlinearity with a new measure called the Walsh sum. <p> However, it is useful to quantify the amount of consistency inherent in a partition or function. This section describes the metric (as proposed by Whitley et. al. <ref> [4] </ref>) which can be used to measure the degree of consistency of a partition. The next section will expand the definition of to define the degree of consistency for a function. <p> When R = P (~; t) from a genetic algorithm population (denoted R dyn ), we say measures the degree of dynamic ranking for a partition at time t. The maximum possible value for a partition of order k can be computed <ref> [4] </ref> as: max () = q=1 k q1 X i (q i) where k = order () Notice that max does not take t or R as arguments since the target string and ranking function are irrelevant to computation of the maximum possible . max allows to be normalized by dividing <p> In Whitley et. al. <ref> [4] </ref>, it was shown that the correlation between static and dynamic ranking is highest at earlier generations. We also present similar results here; however, our results are broken out by orders of interaction using 6 sets of functions with equal to 1 through 6. <p> To this end, we refine the notion of consistency as introduced by Whitley et. al. <ref> [4] </ref>. We relate consistency and the metric with deception and illustrate that increasing nonlinearity results in more deception and a lower , and thus a lower degree of consistency.
