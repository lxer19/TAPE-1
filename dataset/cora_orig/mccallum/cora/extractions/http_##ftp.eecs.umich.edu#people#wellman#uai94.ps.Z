Abstract: One important factor determining the computa - tional complexity of evaluating a probabilistic network is the cardinality of the state spaces of the nodes. By varying the granularity of the state spaces, one can trade off accuracy in the result for computational efficiency. We present an any - time procedure for approximate evaluation of probabilistic networks based on this idea. On application to some simple networks, the proce - dure exhibits a smooth improvement in approxi - mation quality as computation time increases. This suggests that statespace abstraction is one more useful control parameter for designing real-time probabilistic reasoners.

Reference-contexts: In this case, speed vs. accuracy tradeoffs can be resolved at design time, as the modeler tunes the network to fit the deployment technology and performance requirements at hand. Increasingly, however, probabilistic networks are constructed not by patient craftspeople, but rather are automatically generated from some underlying knowledge representation <ref> (Breese et al. 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One approach that has been suggested for dealing with real-time inference is to perform explicit decision-theoretic metareasoning and construct an optimal probabilistic network with computation time taken into account <ref> (Breese and Horvitz 1991) </ref> . While this approach is ideal in principle, practical application requires specification of the effect of modeling choices on computation time, and imposes a non-negligible overhead of the metalevel optimization.

Reference-contexts: Thus, to preserve the joint distribution while abstracting the state space of a variable, we in general have to intro - duce additional dependence links between the variables predecessors and successors <ref> (Chang and Fung 1991) </ref> . But introducing such links would defeat our original purpose for abstraction, namely to trade accuracy for speed. Hence, we generally choose to forego preservation of the joint (1), in return for inferential efficiency.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that the problem of computing a conditional probability in a probabilistic network is NP-hard <ref> (Cooper 1990) </ref> , and moreover, experience has shown that intractability is the typicalnot just the worstcase.

Reference-contexts: Note that our iterative procedure contains much redundancy, in recomputing the marginals from scratch for each iteration. We expect that performance could (and should!) be improved significantly by making the evaluation more incremental <ref> (DAmbrosio 1993) </ref> . To achieve incrementality requires that we modify the internals of the basic evaluation procedurea step that we have avoided thus far but is undoubtedly necessary for practical use of the procedure. 3.4.

Reference-contexts: Researchers in recent years have adopted a variety of strategies, including approximation (although it has recently been shown that even approximating a conditional probability to a fixed degree of accuracy is NP-hard <ref> (Dagum and Luby 1993) </ref>), restricting network structure, and employing heuristic methods to improve average performance. The problem might be finessed when networks are hand-crafted by knowledge engineers to serve as the core of a consultation system.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, we consider the possibility of modulating precision in the state space of variables in order to generate results of progressively improving approximation as computation time advances. This approach is motivated by the observation that statespace cardinality can have a large impact on computational requirements <ref> (Ezawa 1986) </ref> , and yet the choice of state space is often rather arbitrary. For example, in our traffic applications, many of the variables range over real intervals. The ideal partition of the interval into subintervals depends on our precision requirements and computational resources for a given problem.

Reference-contexts: Other approximation schemes for probabilistic networks have also been proposed, involving deletion of nodes, links, or states (Jensen and Andersen 1990; Kjrulff 1993; Sarkar 1993). The uncertain reasoning literature has also seen some alternate approaches to abstraction in probabilistic networks (Poh et al. 1994) and probabilistic reasoning <ref> (Horvitz and Klein 1993) </ref>. Finally, there has been some investigation of the general problem of reasoning about the quality of approximate models (Laskey and Lehner 1994) . We are currently exploring the relations among all these approaches and our own work. 6.

Reference-contexts: In these examples, the OPN had eight states per node, and the graph presents values for itera - tions one through seven. At each iteration, we evaluate the probability of each node given the evidence, using Shachters graph-reduction method <ref> (Shachter 1988) </ref> . 3 In iteration k, each node has k states. Note that the time per iteration increases substantially (exponentially) as we pro - ceed.
