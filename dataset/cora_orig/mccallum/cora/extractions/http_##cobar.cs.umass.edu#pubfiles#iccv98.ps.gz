Title: Retrieving Images by Appearance

Abstract: A system to retrieve images using a description of the image intensity surface is presented. Gaussian derivative filters at several scales are applied to the image and low order 2D differential invariants are computed. The resulting multi-scale representation is indexed for rapid retrieval. Queries are designed by the users from an example image by selecting appropriate regions. The invariant vectors corresponding to these regions are matched with the database counterparts both in feature and coordinate space. This yields a match score per image. Images are sorted by the match score and displayed. Experiments conducted with over 1500 images of objects embedded in arbitrary backgrounds are described. It is observed that images similar in appearance and whose viewpoint is within small view variations of the query can be retrieved with an average precision 1 of 56%.

Reference-contexts: The family of Gaussian filters are unique in their ability to describe the scale-space or deep structure <ref> [2, 4, 1] </ref> of a function and are well suited for representing appearance.

These combinations yield a set of differential invariants <ref> [1] </ref> that are invariant to two-dimensional rigid transformations. Retrieval is achieved in two computational steps. During the off-line computation phase each image in the database is first filtered at sampled locations and then filter responses across the entire database are indexed (see Section 4). <p> The choice of the Gaussian as the smooth test function, as opposed to others, is motivated by the fact that it is unique in describing the scale-space or deep structure of an arbitrary function. For a review of scale space, the reader is referred to <ref> [9, 2, 1, 4] </ref>. Scale-- space has an important physical interpretation in that it models the change in appearance of an imaged object as it moves away from a camera. An argument is therefore made for a multi-scale feature vector which describes the intensity surface locally at several scales. <p> In this paper the multi-scale vector is computed at three different scales placed half an octave apart. 4.1 Indexing Multi-Scale Invariant Vec <p>- tors Given the derivatives of an image I, irreducible differential invariants (invariant under the group of displacements) can be computed in a systematic manner <ref> [1] </ref>. The value of these entities is independent of the choice of coordinate frame (up to rotations).

Reference-contexts: The multi-scale feature vector are transformed so that the elements within this vector are invariant to 2D rigid transformations. This transformed feature vector is called the multi-scale invariant vector.

Several other approaches in the literature take the entire feature set or some global representation over the entire image (see <ref> [5] </ref> for examples). While this may be reasonable for certain types of retrieval, it cannot necessarily be used for general purpose retrieval.

The next immediate step is to explicitly incorporate matching across size variations akin to the correlation approach.

Reference-contexts: The experiments conducted in this paper verify the association that objects that appear to be visually similar can be retrieved by a characterization of the shape of the intensity surface. Different representations of appearance have been used in object recognition <ref> [8] </ref>. Other representations have been used for specific types of retrieval such as face recognition. The approach taken here does not rely on image segmentation (manual or automatic) or binary feature extraction. Unlike some of the previously mentioned methods, no training is required. <p> Due to lack of space, the reader is referred to [5] for a review of the literature.
