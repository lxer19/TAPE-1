Abstract: Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) allows one to derive a quantitative representation from a set of qualitative data which satisfy certain simple constraints. As a tool for vision, MDS combines the advantages of both qualitative and classical approaches, by relying, on the one hand, on an ordinal-scale input representation, and by supporting, on the other hand, the extraction of metric information. The proposed approach is illustrated on the example of stereopsis, although it is applicable also to the processing of other visual cues, as well as to the integration of several cues within a common computational framework.

Reference-contexts: 1 Motivation: quantitative information from qualitative mea surements A growing body of work in computer vision and visual perception is aimed at exploiting the advantages of the qualitative approach to the representation and processing of visual information <ref> [1] </ref>. According to the proponents of qualitative vision, trading precision for robustness can yield stable and noise-free representations without sacrificing utility for real-world tasks.

Reference-contexts: In many applications, the exact distances may be unknown, but a set of quantities monotonically related to the true distances may be available. The problem in this case is known as nonmetric MDS. Beals et al. <ref> [2] </ref> have identified a set of simple conditions that must be fulfilled by distance ranks if the points that gave rise to the distances are to be embeddable in a metric space.

Reference-contexts: at perceiving quantities related to the rank order of points in depth (e.g., a global characterization of their distribution) than at perceiving the metrics of the viewed shapes (this result has been established for the perception of shape from shading [14], although it seems to hold also for binocular stereo <ref> [4] </ref>). Surprisingly, retaining just the qualitative information (e.g., the ranks of d ij ) in the data submitted to MDS does not preclude the possibility of recovering the geometry of the configuration that gave rise to the data, provided that enough points are available.

Reference-contexts: Right: a face (234 fi 218 pixels). 2.6 Real stereo pairs: NEC matcher We then tested the NMDS method on a few natural images using two different matching algorithms. 3 The first one is the intensity-based matcher described in <ref> [5] </ref>. 4 This matcher produces a dense disparity field, in which the value of pixels designated as occluded is set to 0.

Reference-contexts: Each image was represented by a large number (typically, 20; 000) of linear RFs, each of which consisted of several Gabor filters of different orientation (the response of each RF was therefore a vector; cf. <ref> [6] </ref>). To add biological realism, the RFs were highly overlapping and were placed at random locations chosen independently (for each RF and each "eye") from a uniform distribution.

Reference-contexts: In nonmetric MDS, the cost function penalizes instead deviations from the given rank order of the pairwise distances. In our implementation, the algorithm followed the monotone regression approach described in <ref> [7] </ref>. We first tested the nonmetric MDS stereo algorithm (NMDS) on artificial data sets generated by hand (see Figure 4). The results of these tests showed that NMDS is a viable approach to qualitative stereo.

Reference-contexts: be used to recover depth. 2.2 Multidimensional scaling (MDS) Our method is based on multidimensional scaling (MDS) | a family of algorithms that allow the recovery of the geometric structure of a set of points from information related to their pairwise distances (for a concise and readily accessible review, see <ref> [13] </ref>). If the distances themselves are given, the problem is called metric MDS. <p> The only condition imposed on the inter-point difference data that serves as input to MDS is that they covary monotonically with the "real" distances to be recovered by the procedure <ref> [13] </ref>. Clearly, this condition is satisfied in the present case.

Reference-contexts: data on shape perception indicate that human subjects are better at perceiving quantities related to the rank order of points in depth (e.g., a global characterization of their distribution) than at perceiving the metrics of the viewed shapes (this result has been established for the perception of shape from shading <ref> [14] </ref>, although it seems to hold also for binocular stereo [4]).

Reference-contexts: For example, it should be possible to integrate shading with stereo simply by including input from shading as an additional term in the MDS cost function. Integration of motion information may also be possible (note that Ullman's incremental rigidity algorithm for the recovery of structure from motion <ref> [15] </ref> minimizes a cost function expressed in terms of inter-point distances). The proposed approach to the recovery of depth from stereo has interesting biological connotations.

Reference-contexts: In binocular stereopsis, for example, one may process disparity data to compute qualitative characteristics of the surface such as the sign of its Gaussian curvature <ref> [16] </ref>, instead of trying to recover surface depth. In the present work, we show that it is possible to derive a quantitative representation from an intermediate set of qualitative data which satisfy certain simple constraints.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the coordinates of the points can be recovered essentially by an eigenvalue decomposition of the distance matrix, the rank of which, in the absence of errors, must be equal to the dimensionality of the underlying space <ref> [18] </ref>. In many applications, the exact distances may be unknown, but a set of quantities monotonically related to the true distances may be available. The problem in this case is known as nonmetric MDS.
