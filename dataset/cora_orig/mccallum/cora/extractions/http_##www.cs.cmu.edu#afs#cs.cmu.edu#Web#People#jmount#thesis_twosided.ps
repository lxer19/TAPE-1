Reference-contexts: We will not treat Markov chains in their full generality, but discuss only the nice chains used in this thesis. For a much more general treatment one should refer to <ref> [Bil86] </ref>. Nice involves some technical definitions from the theory of Markov chains, but we will define all the terms used in this section. The chains we will use will be chosen to be irreducible, aperiodic and time-reversible.

Reference-contexts: The counting function turns out to be polynomial of degree (m 1)(n 1) in k. The highest degree coefficient of this polynomial is the volume of the transportation polytope, a quantity of independent interest.

In addition to proving the counting function is piecewise polynomial we demonstrate a poly time (for fixed dimension) method of computing the decomposition into pieces and techniques for inferring the polynomials.

Reference-contexts: Their scheme requires several significance tests which come down to counting contingency tables. Unfortunately the counting problem is difficult (]P hard) even for 2 fi n tables. An example (adapted from <ref> [DE] </ref>) is in order (this is example should not be construed as being the only application). The table 1.1 is from Snee [Sne74].

Reference-contexts: A two way contingency table is a matrix of non-negative integers. These tables are often used to represent how many individuals have pairs of attributes (i.e. rows are indexed by one attribute, columns by the other) in a population.[Agr90] Diaconis and Efron <ref> [DE85] </ref> have proposed a significance test and a model fit that can be performed with the aid of a near-uniform sampler for tables that obey given row and column constraints. <p> That is if we stocked our warehouse according to the plan x we would be able to fill all our orders with probability at least ff. It should be clean that component commonality is a special case of up-monotone optimization. 1.2 Contingency tables. Diaconis and Efron <ref> [DE85] </ref> have developed a method of modeling distributions that allows one to make some qualitative and quantitative statements about an unknown distribution. This technique is potentially much more useful than the usual task of proving the unknown distribution is not various test distributions. <p> Because of this observation it is considered good practice (c.f. <ref> [DE85] </ref>) to perform the desired significance tests in the subset of contingency tables that have Y i;fl = r i and Y fl;j = c j . <p> This guarantees rejection if any constant percentage of the classifications are in error, no matter how small, is present in the data. Diaconis and Efron <ref> [DE85] </ref> suggest a number of techniques to deal with this problem including a significance test based on the uniform distribution. <p> This can be important because if one decides to reject the independence hypothesis H 1 one often still needs to characterize the table in question. 3.2.3 Some counting preliminaries We now investigate ](r; c) in its own right. Good references for this problem are <ref> [DG94, DE85, DS93] </ref>. When we have m = n and r = c = k ~ 1 the problem reduces the the classic problem of counting the number of magic squares. The counting function turns out to be polynomial of degree (m 1)(n 1) in k. <p> constraints and to multiply it by an estimate of the odds of satisfying the column constraints. 2 = P (n + 1)n 2 n 1 X j T 2 =n p 2 2 n i=1 r i + n 1 ! And the final estimate is from Diaconis and Efron <ref> [DE85] </ref>. This estimate is based on a volume times density of lattice argument- with the novel innovation that the volume is purposefully overestimated to compensate for some corner effects missed in this type of analysis.

Reference-contexts: We need to find a relationship between the number of steps walked and how close we are to the steady state. For this we need a central result of Sinclair and Jerrum [SJ89]. We also need several well-know facts that are collected in <ref> [DS91] </ref>. Let X be the set of states in our Markov chain. For x; y 2 X, let P t (x; y) be the probability that starting in state x we are in state y after t steps. <p> This is because we do not insist that we have P (x; x) 1 2 for all x. Because of this, we not only need an upper bound for the second largest eigenvalue but also need a lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue <ref> [DS91] </ref>. We will use Proposition 3 from [DS91] which says: 33 X jP t (x; y) (y)j u t 1 (x) ( fl ) t where, fl = max ( 1 ; j m j), where 1 is the second largest eigenvalue and m is the smallest eigenvalue of P , <p> Because of this, we not only need an upper bound for the second largest eigenvalue but also need a lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue <ref> [DS91] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If one can count lattice points one can compute volumes and the converse is often true. The following is taken from Gruber and Lekkerkerker <ref> [GL87] </ref>. A lattice polytope is a polytope with all integral vertices. For a lattice polytope P and natural number k we have ](Z n " kP ) = i=0 where the L i are rational numbers depending only on P and n. <p> l i d linearly independent columns of M and let L = (l i 1 ; ; l i d ) then we see 8v 2 Q d p (v) = p (L 1 v). 2 We now state, without proof, an important result in the geometry of numbers (see <ref> [GL87] </ref> pp. 135-140). Theorem 7 (McMullen) If P 1 ; P 2 ; P k are integral polytopes in R s then for non-negative 2 Z k then ] P k is a polynomial in 1 ; 2 ; k of total degree no more than s. <p> Because A is totally unimodular we know from <ref> [GL87] </ref> (pp. 135-140) there is a polynomial p C of degree w d in variables x 1 x k such that if v 2 Z d , x 2 Z k and v = i=1 x i c i (x i 0) then the number of lattice points in P v <p> We identify c j = a j (j = 1; n), ,r 1 = b and r 2 = j=1 a j . We then use the fact <ref> [GL87] </ref> that for integer k the function f (k) = ](kr; kc) is a degree n1 polynomial in k and the coefficient of k n1 is the 76 desired volume.

Reference-contexts: One can also see Vaidya [Vai89] for a state of the art general convex programming algorithm. However, these approaches all require a separation oracle. A technique described by Yudin and Nemirovskii can be used to convert a membership oracle to a separation oracle <ref> [GLS88] </ref>, but this is quite expensive. Previous efforts to solve component commonality have used non-linear programming methods, but these require that gradients be calculated, which can be as expensive as computing separating cuts. <p> We are interested in minimizing a linear function, c, over a convex body K R n presented by a membership oracle. This is the most general form of a linear convex optimization problem. Under the oracle model <ref> [GLS88] </ref> the convex body K is presented as a tape containing (n; x; r; R) where n is dimension of space we are working in, x 2 Q n is a rational point in K, r &gt; 0 is such that B r (x) K and R is such that K <p> The fact that any two closed disjoint convex sets can be separated by such a linear relation is one of the central properties of convexity. Separating relations can be derived from a membership oracle <ref> [GLS88, NY83] </ref> but the reduction is complicated and expensive. 2.2 Algorithm outline and time bounds. Using the membership oracle, we approximately minimize a linear function over an up-monotone convex feasible set in the positive orthant as follows. <p> By a theorem of Yudin and Nemirovskiii it is known that membership and separation are polynomial time equivalent for convex programming problems like this one <ref> [GLS88] </ref>. But the conversion has a large exponent, and the approach here is more efficient. <p> In <ref> [GLS88] </ref> the version of the Yudin- Nemirovskiii separation from membership algorithm requires O ~ (n 6 ) membership tests to build a single approximate separator and then the shallow cut ellipsoid algorithm may need O ~ (n 4 ) separators to optimize.

Reference-contexts: If very few tables have 2 higher than Y we should know that Y is a unlikely table under the independence hypothesis H 1 . 3.2.1 Fisher-Yates test There are a lot of asymptotic methods for computing the significance (with respect to the Fisher-Yates distribution) of a contingency table <ref> [MP83, GM77, BOP92, BOP88] </ref>. Most of these techniques rely on the central limit theorem and normal approximations to the Fisher-Yates distribution. These method are often quite far off for moderate sized tables. Fortunately there is an obvious pseudo polynomial scheme for generating such tables from the Fisher-Yates distribution. <p> When the sparsity condition is not met this estimate tends to be off by an exponential factor (and is not used for the type of contingency tables arising in statistics).

Reference-contexts: In this section, we determine how many steps are necessary for the Markov chain to mix. We need to find a relationship between the number of steps walked and how close we are to the steady state. For this we need a central result of Sinclair and Jerrum <ref> [SJ89] </ref>. We also need several well-know facts that are collected in [DS91]. Let X be the set of states in our Markov chain. For x; y 2 X, let P t (x; y) be the probability that starting in state x we are in state y after t steps. <p> As before, let be the unique steady state distribution for our chain (approximately B (L;T ) ). Recall that P (x; y) induces a time reversible irreducible aperiodic Markov chain; however, it is not strongly aperiodic <ref> [SJ89] </ref>. This is because we do not insist that we have P (x; x) 1 2 for all x. Because of this, we not only need an upper bound for the second largest eigenvalue but also need a lower bound on the smallest eigenvalue [DS91]. <p> We find an upper bound on 1 by appealing to a result of Sinclair and Jerrum's <ref> [SJ89] </ref>, which is quoted also as Proposition 6 of [DS91], namely, 1 1 2 where is a lower bound on the conductance (defined in section 2.6.1) of the Markov chain.
