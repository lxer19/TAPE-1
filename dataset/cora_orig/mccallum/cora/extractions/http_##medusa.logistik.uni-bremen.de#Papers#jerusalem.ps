Abstract: A frequently observed difficulty in the application of genetic algorithms to the domain of optimization arises from premature convergence. In order to preserve genotype diversity we develop a new model of auto-adaptive behavior for individuals. In this model a population member is an active individual that assumes social-like behavior patterns. Different individuals living in the same population can assume different patterns. By moving in a hierarchy of "social states" individuals change their behavior. Changes of social state are controlled by arguments of plausibility. These arguments are implemented as a rule set for a massively-parallel genetic algorithm. Computational experiments on 12 large-scale job shop benchmark problems show that the results of the new approach dominate the ordinary genetic algorithm significantly.

Reference-contexts: It preserves the n=m permutation-structure and inherits nearly half of the relative gene-order from both parents to the offspring. Mutation results from a position-based random-change of an arbitrary gene. An elegant way of modeling the job shop problem via a disjunctive graph is given by Adams et. al. <ref> [1] </ref>. Each oriented acyclic graph in the disjunctive graph represents a feasible solution. The cost of the longest-path in such a graph gives the makespan of the represented solution. Solving a job shop problem means to find the acyclic oriented graph with the minimal longest-path.

Table 2. Results for 10 "tough" job shop problems (see [2], table V). heterogeneity, i.e. SBP prevents the building of rigid fitness plateaus. Even after 300 generations the situation has hardly changed. Although regions of higher fitness have grown the population is still active. Summing up, both versions of PGA lead to optimal or near-optimal solutions of the Muth-Thompson benchmarks.

Reference-contexts: In order to compare computational results we consider the measure that is predominantly used in literature: To minimize of the total completion time, i.e the makespan. PGA uses a genetic representation of the job shop problem described in <ref> [3] </ref>. In this approach a solution's genotype is defined by a permutation with repetition. The permutation contains n fi m genes from the alphabet fJ 1 ; : : : J n g, where J k denotes job k. Within a chromosome each gene is repeated exactly m times. <p> The i-th occurrence of a gene in the string refers to the i-th operation of the named job. Crossover is done by a generalized order-crossover technique <ref> [3] </ref>. It preserves the n=m permutation-structure and inherits nearly half of the relative gene-order from both parents to the offspring. Mutation results from a position-based random-change of an arbitrary gene. An elegant way of modeling the job shop problem via a disjunctive graph is given by Adams et. al. [1].

Reference-contexts: More direct approaches of incest prevention are based on the measure of similarity between genotypes by means of the hamming distance.

Nevertheless, concerning scheduling Simulated-Annealing and especially Tabu-Search perform better than GA's. The standard problem of job shop scheduling can now be described roughly. A production program containing n jobs is released.

Reference-contexts: Both models restrict immediate data flow between individuals to local areas of the population. Thereby the nature-like feature of ecological niches is introduced into population dynamics. This feature is expected to preserve genotype diversity within useful bounds. Since 1988, when Muhlenbein and Gorges-Schleuter developed the diffusion model <ref> [11] </ref> this kind of population structure received increasing attention. The probably most exciting feature of neighborhood structures is the explicit introduction of parallelism. It enables individuals to act without centralized control. Mate-selection and offspring-replacement are done locally. For this reason the diffusion model fits the restrictions of massively-parallel environments.

Reference-contexts: Each individual must respond to its own specific environmental conditions. Thus individuals are able to change behavior usefully as a function of immediate changes of the environment. The psychologist school of Behaviorism became important in the early days of the 20 th century. Staats gives a comprehensive survey in <ref> [12] </ref>. He emphasizes that complex functional behavior of an individual is learned and that environmental events can affect the individuals behavior.
