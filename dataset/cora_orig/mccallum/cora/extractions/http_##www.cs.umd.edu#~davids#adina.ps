Abstract: We are developing an Architecture for Distributed INformation system Access (ADINA), which is a mediated architecture to support a simplified database interface for applications that search heterogeneous multimedia scientific data archives. ADINA provides an insulation layer to applications that query archive metadatabases with different conceptual and logical structures. To search underlying databases, applications do not need to understand the interrelationship of the databases, their individual database semantics (i.e., schemas), or their syntax (i.e., attribute names, keywords, data units, or data formats). Furthermore, applications do not even need to know of the existence of all data archives that satisfy requests. Application programmers formulate high-level SQL queries using their own domain terminology in which they specify only attributes and constraints. Since it is presumed that application programmers have incomplete knowledge of the underlying database environment, no FROM clause or joins are required. ADINA, in turn, discovers which databases can best answer incoming high-level queries, translates them to queries on the underlying databases, and fuses the results. Core to the architecture is a knowledge base that captures data models and ontologies (domain vocabularies) of applications and underlying databases as well as interlingua (inter-ontology translations) of broad scientific domains. ADINA provides true interoperability in that applications and databases can fully interoperate without having to account for each other's internal models or structures.
