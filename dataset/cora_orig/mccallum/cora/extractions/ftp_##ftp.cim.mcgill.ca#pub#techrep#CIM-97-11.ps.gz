Reference-contexts: The ordering of the braces is important because it shows the location of the links between each other. The first link is defined first; then, the second link and so on. The notation to represent the DH parameters <ref> [1] </ref>, follows, a is the link length. b is the link offset. al (ff) is the link twist. th () is the joint angle. In addition, the joint limits can be provided.
