Title: Locally Controllable Polygons by Stable Pushing

Abstract: This paper characterizes polygons that are small-time locally controllable by stable pushing as a function of the polygon shape, the location of the center of friction, and the friction coefficient at the pushing contact. Such polygons can be pushed to follow any path arbitrarily closely, a useful property for planar manipulation. Because the pushes are stable, pushing plans can be executed without feedback.

In the next section we provide definitions and a basic result used throughout the paper. Section 3 gives an algorithm for finding the minimum friction coefficient that yields STLC for a given part. Section 4 presents results on the minimum friction needed for STLC for classes of polygons.

Reference-contexts: If we have this property, we can maneuver the part in tight places. We have previously shown that any object, other than a frictionless disk centered at its center of friction, is STLC by pushing with point contact (Lynch and Mason <ref> [6] </ref>). <p> Stable pushes make it possible to plan pushing paths (Figure 1) which can be executed without feedback. A pushing planner and experiments are described in (Lynch and Mason <ref> [6] </ref>). By switching the line contacts, it is often possible to achieve STLC by stable pushing. We would like to characterize the set of polygons that are STLC by stable pushing. In this paper we give conditions for a polygon to be STLC in contact. <p> A translation is a velocity with a zero angular component. As with forces, we can define interior and boundary velocities of a set of velocities. In a previous paper (Lynch and Mason <ref> [6] </ref>) we described the procedure STABLE that determines a set of stable pushing motions for a given line contact, friction coefficient, and center of friction. We reproduce it in Figure 4. <p> To show they are necessary, assume the pure forces positively span a half-plane. Then STABLE will find a set of velocity directions confined to an open half-space H, along with two opposing translations on the plane bounding H. These velocities do not provide STLC (Lynch and Mason <ref> [6] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: where p is the distance from the endpoint to the center of friction and r is the distance from the center of friction to the most distant support point of the slider. (This tip line should actually be slightly more distant from the center of friction; see (Peshkin and Sanderson <ref> [10] </ref>) for details.) The rotation center from pushing on this endpoint must lie in the band between these two lines.

Reference-contexts: By patching together these neighborhoods, the slider can follow any path arbitrarily closely. A sufficient condition for STLC of a system at a state q is that the set of feasible motion directions (tangent vectors) positively spans the system's tangent space at q (Sussmann <ref> [13] </ref>). For the slider, the tangent vectors are the stable pushing directions and the tangent space is the space of all slider velocities. We study stable pushing with line contact. The slider is a convex polygon and the pusher is a flat edge aligned with an edge of the polygon.
