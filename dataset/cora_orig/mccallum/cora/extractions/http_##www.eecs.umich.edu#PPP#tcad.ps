Abstract: Aggressive design using level-sensitive latches and wave pipelining has been proposed to meet the increasing need for higher performance digital systems. The optimal clocking problem for such designs has been formulated using an accurate timing model. However, this problem has been difficult to solve because of its nonconvex solution space. The best algorithms to date employ linear programs to solve an overconstrained case that has a convex solution space, yielding suboptimal solutions to the general problem. A new efficient (cubic complexity) algorithm, Gpipe, exploits the geometric characteristics of the full nonconvex solution space to determine the maximum single-phase clocking rate for a closed pipeline with a specified degree of wave pipe-lining. Introducing or increasing wave pipelining by permanently enabling some latches is also investigated. Sufficient conditions have been found to identify which latches can be removed in this fashion so as to guarantee no decrease and permit a possible increase in the clock rate. Although increasing the degree of wave pipelining can result in faster clocking, wave pipelining is often avoided in design due to difficulties in stopping and restarting the pipeline under stall conditions without losing data, or in reduced rate testing of the circuit. To solve this problem, which has not previously been addressed, we present conditions and implementation methods that insure the stoppability and restartability of a wave pipeline.

Reference-contexts: Level-sensitive latches are used as synchronizers to achieve higher clock rates in synchronous systems. During the active (latch enabled) region of the clock period, level-sensitive latches permit an input signal to propagate through the latch to the output. This property of latches allows time borrowing <ref> [9] </ref> which tends to average the propagation delays of successive stages, resulting in a faster clock. However, timing verification and optimization for latch-controlled systems becomes more complicated when time borrowing is allowed.

Reference-contexts: However, the maximum clock rate of the general formulation may not be found as it may be rendered infeasible in the overconstrained problem. The work reported here is developed from the latch-based timing constraints for a closed pipeline found in <ref> [13] </ref>. Some of the early results are summarized in [16]. The goal of this work is to solve the nonconvex maximum rate single-phase clocking problem using the general problem formulation. The relationships among the three types of timing constraints are studied. <p> A key contribution of this paper is that we analyze the problem of stopping and restarting of wave pipelines and provide a solution using redundant latches. In this paper, section 2 is a brief review and some extension of the work in <ref> [13] </ref>. Section 3 is a detailed description and complexity analysis of the underlying algorithm of Gpipe. Section 4 provides a theoretical basis for the study of removing latches from a pipeline circuit. Section 5 illustrates the use of the Gpipe program and presents some examples of removing latches. <p> Section 6 addresses the questions of stopping and starting a closed pipeline with a single-phase clock and level sensitive latches. 2 Pipeline and Clocking Model The pipeline and clocking model is based on the closed pipeline model described in <ref> [13] </ref>. The pipeline is modeled as a single closed loop with N stages separated by N synchronizers, which are chosen to be latches in this paper (Fig. 1). Latches are harder to model, but impose less clocking overhead than ip-ops. <p> K may be thought of as the number of virtual stages in a closed pipeline, where N is the number of latches, or physical stages. 2.1 Derivation of Optimal Cycle Time Constraints We can now adapt and summarize the derivation in <ref> [13] </ref> to yield a necessary and sufficient set of constraints, (9)-(13), that defines all feasible (T 1 , T c ) solutions, and hence minimum T c , for sin a i T c T 1 - d i a i = D i A i = d i T c <p> 18 T 1 3T c + 42 T 1 3T c + 42 T 1 1T c + 22 T 1 1T c + 18 T 1 3T c + 42 T 1 3T c + 42 Maximum Rate Single-Phase Clocking of a Closed Pipeline 21 From the analysis in <ref> [13] </ref>, we know that the short path constraint with for stage i applies when the early data wavefront departs from the previous latch (i-1) at the enabling edge of its clock, i.e. the early arrival data wavefront (a i-1 ) is blocked by latch i-1 until its clock goes high, and
