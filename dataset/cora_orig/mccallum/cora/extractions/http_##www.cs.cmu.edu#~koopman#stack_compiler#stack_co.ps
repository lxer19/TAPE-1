Abstract: This paper presents an experimental code generator that performs intra-block stack scheduling for a stack-based execution model. For small test programs, 91% to 100% of redundant local variable accesses were eliminated using this compiler. Compiled intra-block stack scheduling and hand-per-formed global stack scheduling show that significant opportunities exist to keep temporary variable values on the expression evaluation stack when compiling conventional languages.
