Abstract: To extend the widespread use of HIPPI as a networking solutions for high-speed communications, the 25-meter distance limitation must be solved. Three options available for alleviating the problem of distance limitation of HIPPI networks are Serial-HIPPI, HIPPI/SONET mapping or HIPPI-ATM mapping, and IP Routing. Serial-HIPPI, HIPPI/SONET mapping and HIPPI-ATM mapping provide extended HIPPI connectivities at the physical layer, while IP Routing forwards data between HIPPI networks and other networks at the network layer. In this paper, we study two feasible solutions of this problem, HIPPI Tunneling (HIPPI-ATM mapping) and IP Routing. We compare these two schemes in terms of network connectivities, protocol overhead, and flow control. The performance evaluation of one implementation of the HIPPI tunneling and IP Routing is presented. Experimental performance suggests that a high degree of bandwidth utilization was achieved by both HIPPI Tunneling and IP Routing in this implementation.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to find out the protocol overhead and available bandwidth of HIPPI-ATM with the above information. The OC-3c provides 135.632 Mbits/sec bandwidth to the AAL after considering the protocol overhead of SONET and ATM <ref> [1] </ref>. With 1032-byte H-PDUs, we need to use AAL 5 PDU of 1056 bytes, 22 ATM cells, to encapsulate one H-PDU. Since AAL 5 uses Unused Pad bytes to fill out the last ATM cell to right adjust the AAL 5 Tail.

Reference-contexts: Up to 16 SONET OC-3 paths can be multiplexed together to form an OC-48 stream when multiple HIPPI packets are being transferred. Both of these schemes utilize the ability to multiplex together multiple OC-3 paths. The packet delay and loss characteristics of a wide-area HIPPI-based testbed was investigated in <ref> [2] </ref>. They show that HIPPI locking, receiving side is busy with existing connection, can degrade performance by increasing delay and/or packet loss.

Reference-contexts: There are three options available for alleviating the problem of distance limitation of HIPPI networks: Serial-HIPPI, HIPPI/SONET or HIPPI-ATM mapping, and IP Routing. * Serial-HIPPI: The serial-HIPPI specifies how the HIPPI packets are to be carried over a pair of fiber optical cables <ref> [3] </ref>. The HIPPI can be extended up to 10 km on single-mode fiber. This option provides a transparent extension cord for HIPPI-PH. <p> The performance evaluation of the implementation is also reported. The IP Routing implementation and its performance on the same environment is described in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper and discusses future work. 2 Related Works The first design to extend HIPPI connectivity was the Serial-HIPPI <ref> [3] </ref>. Serial-HIPPI is an implementor's agreement specifying how the HIPPI packets are to be carried over a pair of optical fiber. Serial-HIPPI was first implemented as HIPPI "modems", which converted HIPPI to serial and back. Further use of Serial-HIPPI can lead to the realization of large-scale HIPPI cross-point switches.

Reference-contexts: Popular data transfer rates are OC-3 (155.520 Mbits/sec) and OC-12 (622.080 Mbits/sec). A HIPPI/SONET mapping scheme over STS-12 SONET was proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>.

Several research groups have proposed or implemented HIPPI/SONET gateways to interconnect HIPPI Local Area Networks (LAN) <ref> [4, 2 8, 16] </ref>. Among these approaches, [4] extends HIPPI's connectivity using SONET STS 12c over OC-12, which operating at 622.080 Mb/s with a payload of around 600 Mb/s. <p> With the potential widespread of SONET connections by public long-haul carrier, SONET provides another mechanism to extend HIPPI's connectivity.

A IP router operates at the network layer, which recovers the data block from one protocol, and maps it into the other protocol, e.g. IP on HIPPI to IP on ATM.

Reference-contexts: Two SGI Challenge machines in the EE/CS Building are used to perform the test in a HIPPI Local Area Network (LAN) environment. To study the performance of HIPPI-FP, a pair of echo-style client and server programs using SGI's HIPPI-FP Application Programming Interface (API) <ref> [6] </ref> is executed on the two SGI Challenge machines. The client measures the latency required to send a message of a certain size to the server and from server back to the client.

Reference-contexts: In order to fully utilize the communication link with large bandwidth fi delay, larger window sizes are required to keep the link full. The RFC-1323 presents a set of TCP extensions to improve performance over large bandwidthfi delay product paths and to provide reliable operation over high-speed paths <ref> [7] </ref>. A TCP Window Scale option was designed to expand the size of the TCP window, which uses a scale factor to carry the actual window size in the 16-bit Window field of the TCP header.

Virtual wide-area HIPPI networks can be built by connecting HIPPI LANs with HIPPI Tunneling through ATM networks. HIPPI-ATM <ref> [15] </ref> defines the frame formats and protocol definitions for encapsulation of HIPPI-PH packets for transfer over ATM equipment. A pair of HIPPI converters (the GigaRouters in our case) are used to perform the HIPPI tunneling task.
