Abstract: We present a principled method of obtaining a weighted similarity metric for 3D image retrieval, firmly rooted in Bayes decision theory. The basic idea is to determine a set of most discriminative features by evaluating how well they perform on the task of classifying images according to predefined semantic categories. We propose this indirect method as a rigorous way to solve the difficult feature selection problem that comes up in most content based image retrieval tasks. The method is applied to normal and pathological neuroradiological CT images, where we take advantage of the fact that normal human brains present an approximate bilateral symmetry which is often absent in pathological brains. The quantitative evaluation of the retrieval system shows promising results.

Reference-contexts: It is our hypothesis that the metric that does well at classifying the images will also do well in finding similar images, since similarity is exactly defined in semantic terms. We use Kernel Regression (KR), a memory based learning (MBL) technique <ref> [1] </ref>, to classify the images in different categories. MBL methods keep all the training data explicitly around, and calculate the posterior probability of a given a feature vector x by referring to all previously labeled instances. This can be implemented efficiently using augmented KD-trees [13].

Reference-contexts: Until two 3D images are properly registered and segmented, existing techniques for content-based retrieval using color, texture, shape and position on 2D images cannot be applied directly for meaningful results.

For this type of data, no robust 3D registration algorithm yet exists that the authors know of.

In classification problems, minimizing the cross-entropy is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood of the training data [3]. Thus, a distance metric that achieves this is presumed to yield good classification performance. <p> The error metric we seek to minimize is cross entropy <ref> [3] </ref>: E = i c where ffi ic represents the 1-of-m multiple class membership encoding.

Reference-contexts: Using this simple guidance, we developed a robust algorithm to automatically extract the ideal midsagittal plane (the plane X 0 = 0 in Figure 2) of a given 3D brain image <ref> [9] </ref>. The yaw and roll angle errors in the input images can be corrected by re-sampling the original 3D image. The region of interest (ROI) in a brain image can present itself as asymmetrical regions from simple comparisons of the two halves of the re-sampled brain image.

The purpose is to use the retrieval results to aid diagnosis, specialist consultation, patient surgical planning, and medical education. Image classification in this domain is to classify images based on their pathology (normal,blood,stroke), i.e. the semantics of an image.

Reference-contexts: We expect feature weights to vary accordingly from the initial classification. An analogy can be made between classification based image retrieval and appearance-based learning <ref> [14] </ref>, where an object recognition process is followed by a pose estimation process performed on different appearance manifolds. Finally, we also would like to combine visual features with collateral information such as age, sex, and symptoms of the patient to obtain a better retrieval rate and faster retrieval speed.
