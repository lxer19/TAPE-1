Abstract: We propose incremental, real-time search as a general approach to real-time decision making. We model real-time decision making as incremental tree search with a limited number of node expansions between decisions. We show that the decision policy of moving toward the best frontier node is not optimal, but nevertheless performs nearly as well as an expected-value-based decision policy. We also show that the real-time constraint causes difficulties for traditional best-first search algorithms. We then present a new approach that uses a separate heuristic function for choosing where to explore and which decision to make. Empirical results for random trees show that our new algorithm outperforms the traditional best-first search approach to real-time decision making, and that depth-first branch-and-bound performs nearly as well as the more complicated best-first variation.

Conclusions Incremental real-time problem solving requires us to reevaluate the traditional approach to exploring a problem space. We have proposed a real-time decision-making problem based on searching a random tree with limited computation time.

Reference-contexts: This decision strategy, which is called minimin decision making in <ref> (Korf 1990) </ref>, has been employed by others for single-agent search (e.g., (Russell & Wefald 1991)), and is also a special case of the two-player minimax decision rule (Shannon 1950). In fact, the optimal decision is to move to node B 2 because it has a lower expected total path cost. <p> Our work is also related to Russell and Wefald's work on DTA* (Rus-sell & Wefald 1991), and can be viewed as an alternative interpretation within their general framework for decision-theoretic problem solving.

Reference-contexts: Our experimental results and pathological examples contradict this suggestion. Related Work Our initial work was motivated by Mutchler's analysis of how to spend scarce search resources to find a complete solution path <ref> (Mutchler 1986) </ref>. He has suggested a similar sequential decision problem and advocated the use of separate functions for exploration and decision making, thus our algorithms can be seen as an extension of his analysis.

We now discuss two pathological behaviors that can result from using a single heuristic function for both exploration and decision making. <p> The results for best-first search are not surprising since node-cost and exploration-cost BFS were not expected to perform well. What is interesting is that a previous decision-theoretic analysis of the exploration problem <ref> (Russell & Wefald 1991) </ref> suggested that, for a given decision heuristic and the single-step assumption (i.e., that the value of a node expansion can be determined by assuming that it is the last computation before a move decision), the best node to explore should be determined by the same heuristic function.
