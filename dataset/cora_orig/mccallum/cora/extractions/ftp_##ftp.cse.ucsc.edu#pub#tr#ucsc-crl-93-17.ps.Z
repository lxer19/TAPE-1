Abstract: The design of high speed digital VLSI circuits prefers that the clock net is routed on the metal layer with the smallest RC delay. This strategy not only avoids the difficulties of having different electrical parameters on different layers, but also eliminates the delay and attenuation of the clock signal through vias. The clock phase-delay is also decreased. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, based on hierarchical max-min optimization, to construct a planar clock tree which can be embedded on a single metal layer. The clock tree achieves equal path length| the length of the path from the clock source to each clock terminal is exactly the same. In addition, the path length from the source to clock terminals is minimized. Some examples including industrial benchmarks have been tested and the results are promising. We further optimize the geometry of the clock tree to minimize both the skew and path delay of the clock signal while maintaining the planarity of the clock network. Some premilinary results are promising which achieve near zero skew by using SPICE simulation.

Reference-contexts: But no bound is given for the general case. An improved algorithm [22] considers Elmore delay balance instead of geometric length balance but adopts a bottom-up process similar to that of [14].

Another algorithm in <ref> [6] </ref> improves the Elmore delay matching method by considering the minimization of the total wire length.

During the sizing, the clock topology is well maintained. In this paper, we assume that the clock tree behaves as a RC tree with a source at the root. <p> Note that clock pins are allowed to have different load capacitances. of a terminal. We size the branches of the clock tree in a bottom up order of starting from clock terminals. The similar algorithm is proposed in <ref> [22] </ref>. However, instead of the branch lengths [22], we take the branch widths as variables. First, we state the sizing algorithm 18 7.

However, instead of the branch lengths [22], we take the branch widths as variables. First, we state the sizing algorithm 18 7. Sizing Widths of Clock Tree for a binary clock tree. At the end of this section, we will show that the algorithm can be applied on a general clock tree with arbitrary node degree. <p> Our algorithm also constructs a planar clock tree with equal path length for Primary2 (see Figure 8.2), while the RGM algorithm produces a non-planar tree with many overlaps (see Figure 8.3). The other previous algorithms obtain similar non-planar trees <ref> [13, 22, 6] </ref>. The nonplanar clock tree must employ two or more routing layers to finish physical embedding, such that worsening the clock skew and source-sink path delay because of electrical parameter variations of different layers and vias.

Reference-contexts: Some concluding remarks are given in section 9, where we show that the algorithm can be used to construct a planar equal path length Steiner tree not only in Manhanttan space but also in Euclidean space. A short version of this paper has been presented at ICCAD-92 <ref> [24] </ref>. 2 Planar Equal Path length Steiner Tree A clock source and a set of clock terminals (sinks) form a clock net in a VLSI chip or a multi-chip module. A clock tree, T , of the clock net is a Steiner tree which connects all sinks with the source.
