Abstract: Let f(x) be a polynomial of degree d with rational coefficients and let t be a positive integer deg(f ): We consider the problem of finding a t-sparse shift for f(x): The problem is to find an ff; if one exists (in some algebraic extension of the rationals), such that in the representation of f (x) in the basis 1; x ff; (x ff) 2 ; : : : ; i.e., f(x) = most t of the coefficients f i are non-zero. We derive explicit conditions for the uniqueness and rationality of a t-sparse shift for f (x) and provide an efficient algorithm for computing a sparse shift when one exists. We also point out an application of our result to the problem of constructing sparse decompositions of univariate polynomials.

Reference-contexts: functions can be evaluated quickly and that makes them attractive to several applications and an interesting line of research is to try to infer properties of sparse polynomials (such as divisibility, existence of non-trivial gcd, the existence of real roots etc.) from their values at a small number points (see <ref> [12] </ref>). Traditionally, "sparse polynomial (or rational function)" is taken to mean a polynomial (or rational function) with a "few terms" where the "terms" are power products of the variables involved.
