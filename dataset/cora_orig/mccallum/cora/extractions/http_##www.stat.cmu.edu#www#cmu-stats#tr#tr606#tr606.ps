Abstract: Stanley Warner was widely known for the creation of the randomized response technique for asking sensitive questions in surveys. Over almost two decades he also formulated and developed statistical methodology for another problem, that of deriving balanced information in advocacy settings so that both positions regarding a policy issue can be fairly and adequately represented. We review this work, including two survey applications implemented by Warner in which he applied the methodology, and we set the ideas into the context of current methodological thinking.

Reference-contexts: In Section 2, we present his basic approach to the advocacy problem and we describe the statistical model he chose to focus upon <ref> (Warner, 2 1975) </ref>. In Sections 3 and 4, we discuss embellishments of the basic approach which he pre-sented in subsequent papers (e.g. see Warner, 1981, 1984, 1985, 1987a), and we end by describing how Warner continued to pursue this research program up until the time of his death.

This paper also signals a substantial change in Warner's thinking about statistics and probability, towards a subjective Bayesian approach and away from the classical approaches that he stressed in his early career.

Reference-contexts: The problem with using the data from the Pickering experiment is that we are in effect matching the individuals in the control group and the experimental group. What we really want is both the prior and the posterior assessments from the same individual <ref> (Warner, 1987b) </ref>. <p> the classroom and in reflecting back upon the work described here, he noted: "...almost all of the basic elements of an elementary statistics course are to some degree represented in these procedures, and the problems in modeling and design that are suggested could be considered at quite an advanced level." <ref> (Warner, 1987b) </ref> The statistics profession has lost a true innovator and a great educator. We count ourselves amongst Stanley Warner's students and we continue to learn from his work.
