Reference-contexts: One approach for rate adaption is to adjust the transmission rate from within the network. In this way, heterogeneity is "locally" accommodated by fine-tuning the transmission rate to exactly match the available capacity on each link in network. Amir et al. developed an application level video gateway <ref> [1] </ref>, called vgw, which, being placed throughout the network, can transcode video streams into a lower bit rate coding, using either the same coding format with different parameters or a different coding scheme. the video gateway engine in this application software is adopted to carry out the video stream filtering work

Reference-contexts: It was also used in vgw. The idea is further deployed in SCP <ref> [3] </ref>. The conference bus is used in vgw for communication between vgw engine and its interface. The same structure is followed in our system: the video filtering engine and audio relay engine interact with their control interface through conference bus (see Figure 14).

Reference-contexts: In turn, each receiver individually tunes its reception rate by adjusting the number of layers that it receives. For more details see <ref> [4] </ref>. 2 Major components 2.1 Network configuration The network configuration used in the UCL-CS MERCI activity is illustrated in Figure 2. The Windows 95 Dial-Up Network subsystem allows remote/mobile users to designate a computer running Window 95 as a dial-up client.
