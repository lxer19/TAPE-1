Title: A Functional Ontology of Law

Abstract: Ontological assumptions are at the very hart of the enterprise of representing knowledge. In AI & Law, these assumptions reflect an underlying view of what law is made of, what legal knowledge is, which knowledge categories play a role in Law and how they interrelate. By and large, however, ontological issues have been rather neglected in AI & Law. The most common ontological view on Law is very simple, and divides legal knowledge into two orthogonal types: rules and cases. In this paper, we will argue extensively in favor of an explicit attention to ontological issues in AI & Law, and put forward this view by proposing a functional ontology of Law. This ontology is basically a set of interconnected primitive categories and subcategories of legal knowledge proposed under a teleological and functional view about the legal system. We will discuss the proposed categories and their interrelations, as well as some of the implications of its use in legal knowledge engineering.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Knowledge representation is, together with (automated) reasoning, arguably the most central issue in Artificial Intelligence. Nevertheless, it may not be clear what a knowledge representation is. In a recent article, <ref> [Davis et al., 1993] </ref> argue that a knowledge representation plays basically five roles. First, it is a surrogate, a mechanism we use to reason about the world instead of acting directly upon it. <p> In this sense (as argued by <ref> [Davis et al., 1993] </ref>) every knowledge representation embeds certain ontological commitments, because it inevitably assumes that some things are there in the world and others simply are not (or are not relevant). <p> This separation is very important, as the AI & Law community seems to confound sometimes the two issues. Using an example from <ref> [Davis et al., 1993] </ref>, one can say that INTERNIST is completely different from MYCIN because they use respectively frames and rules, but this is a very shallow view.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, in almost every application field of AI, epistemological and ontological considerations play a first and major part. For instance, in qualitative reasoning about physical systems, several ontologies were proposed, either with a general character (e.g. <ref> [deKleer & Brown, 1984] </ref>) or specific for a certain sub-domain of physics (e.g. [Hayes, 1978]). <p> These choices are normally implied by practical considerations, and they specifically take into account the other roles of a knowledge representation (see section 1). In some situations, ontologies may even lead directly to systems. For instance, the main ontologies for physical systems proposed in qualitative reasoning (e.g. <ref> [deKleer & Brown, 1984] </ref>) are formally defined and come with a powerful calculus, so that it is possible to construct interpreters which, although inefficient, may well be used to solve problems.

Reference-contexts: Within AI & Law, there is a large amount of work devoted to the representation of world knowledge and particularly the open texture issue; examples are the early work of McCarty [McCarty & Sridharan, 1981] and Gardner's <ref> [Gardner, 1987] </ref> doctoral works.

Reference-contexts: For instance, Hart says: "Usually in discussion of the law [..] to say that someone is responsible for some harm means that in accordance with legal rules [...] it is at least permissible, if not mandatory, to blame or punish or exact compensation from him." <ref> [Hart & Honore, 1985; pag.65] </ref>. In other words, responsibility is the ground (and the only ground) to state the culpability of someone over a situation.

Reference-contexts: Several major legal theorists, in particular positivists, discuss the different types of knowledge involved in legal reasoning, and specially the nature of norms and their different types. For example, Hart's distinction between primary and secondary norms <ref> [Hart, 1961] </ref> has a strong ontological character | in fact, he also distinguished between sub-types of secondary norms. Kelsen has also addressed ontological issues, with different sets of categories of norms being distinguished in different phases of his work. <p> A specific and well-known difficulty in law (present also in other fields as well) is that these definitions are either not precise enough or non-existent, in such a way that they always leave margin to interpretation | the so-called open texture of legal concepts <ref> [Hart, 1961] </ref>. The interpretation process affects both relations class/sub-class (e.g whether or not a bicycle is a vehicle) and relations class-instance (i.e. whether or not a specific thing with two wheels is a bycicle).

Reference-contexts: Indeed, in almost every application field of AI, epistemological and ontological considerations play a first and major part. For instance, in qualitative reasoning about physical systems, several ontologies were proposed, either with a general character (e.g. [deKleer & Brown, 1984]) or specific for a certain sub-domain of physics (e.g. <ref> [Hayes, 1978] </ref>). These concerns about the ontological foundation of artificial reasoning about the physical world have not only brought up theoretical advancements in this domain and in research in knowledge representation in general, but have also led to highly practical models of e.g. diagnostic reasoning about physical devices.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, every command can be interpreted as a prohibition. There is abounding research on the formalization and representation of commanding norms as defined here; basically all the work on deontic logics (for some of many examples, see for instance <ref> [Hilpinen, 1981] </ref>) can be seen as dealing with this category of legal knowledge. In principle, therefore, any of these formalisms can be used to represent and reason about commanding norms.

Reference-contexts: Particularly important types of positional knowledge are the right, the power and the liberty. There has been interesting attempts to develop a theory of legal positions, first with Kanger <ref> [Kanger, 1966] </ref> and later on with Lindahl [Lindahl, 1977].

Reference-contexts: Kelsen has also addressed ontological issues, with different sets of categories of norms being distinguished in different phases of his work. In the ontology we will present in the next section, we will use most of his late ontological characterization of norms <ref> [Kelsen, 1991] </ref>. 3 A Functional Ontology of Law The core of our ontology consists of the a set of knowledge categories (types) that can guide the interpretation of legal knowledge, and a specification of their structure and inter-relations. <p> Several authors in legal theory have proposed typologies of norms, each with a specific focus. We distinguish three types of norms: commanding, derogative and empowering norms. This typology is in fact a simplified version of Kelsen's late typology of norms (as presented in <ref> [Kelsen, 1991] </ref>). Both are based on the functions performed by norms within a legal system. Kelsen distinguished four of these functions: (i) command a certain behaviour; (ii) empower some agent to posit and/or apply norms; (iii) permit some behaviour; (iv) derogate some other norm. <p> For instance, certain officers from the social security department have power to 3 A complete discussion of the reasons behind this simplification is not to be provided here, but we must point out that it is far from arbitrary. Basically, Kelsen himself admits <ref> [Kelsen, 1991; pg.98] </ref> that permitting norms limit (by completely or partially derogating) a prohibition enacted by another norm.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the adequacy of any knowledge representation must be assessed as to how well it plays each of these roles. Moreover, these roles are interconnected. Choices in how a knowledge representation will play a certain role have consequences to other roles. Sometimes these are contradictory requirements; for instance, <ref> [Lenat & Guha, 1990] </ref> point out that there is always a compromise between epistemological adequacy (i.e. how well does a knowledge representation represent the domain it is supposed to represent) and pragmatic adequacy (how efficient it may be implemented in a computer system). <p> Consequently, a large part of the legal abstract model is in fact commonsense knowledge organized in some abstraction hierarchy. Since this involves a huge amount of knowledge, special alternatives must be developed to deal with the problem. The CYC project <ref> [Lenat & Guha, 1990] </ref>, for instance, deals precisely with this type of commonsense knowledge, and we would expect its results to be of high interest in AI & Law.

Reference-contexts: Particularly important types of positional knowledge are the right, the power and the liberty. There has been interesting attempts to develop a theory of legal positions, first with Kanger [Kanger, 1966] and later on with Lindahl <ref> [Lindahl, 1977] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Within AI & Law, there is a large amount of work devoted to the representation of world knowledge and particularly the open texture issue; examples are the early work of McCarty <ref> [McCarty & Sridharan, 1981] </ref> and Gardner's [Gardner, 1987] doctoral works.

Reference-contexts: However, there are the exceptions that confirm the rule. The most notable is McCarty's Language of Legal Discourse <ref> [McCarty, 1989] </ref>. His `modalities' can be seen as knowledge categories of an ontology of Law, linked together with a formal (logical) presentation. <p> refers to causal knowledge. 8 alone have been rather neglected in AI & Law, but there has been some attempts to represent actions as a way towards these issues; in particular, there has been some work on logics of action associated with deontic logics (see for instance [vonWright, 1981] or <ref> [McCarty, 1989] </ref>). 3.4 Reactive and Creative Knowledge Two types of legal knowledge in our ontology have a relatively minor character, insofar as they are not part of the core of legal reasoning. Nevertheless, they are an important part of the structure and work of the legal system.

Reference-contexts: Ontological commitments consist in finding the `right' abstractions so that we can talk about them and put them to work | i.e. to solve problems. Ontological issues are fully knowledge-level issues (in the terms defined by <ref> [Newell, 1982] </ref>), in that they do not imply commitments to any symbol-level decisions (like whether one should use semantic networks. or production systems, or even neural networks). This separation is very important, as the AI & Law community seems to confound sometimes the two issues.

Reference-contexts: For instance, we can formalize terminological reasoning within world knowledge by using or adapting one of the several terminological languages already existent in the literature (see for instance <ref> [Patel-Schneider et al., 1990] </ref>), or we can formalize causal knowledge with one of the numerous formalisms for causal reasoning (e.g. [Console & Torasso, 1990]).

Reference-contexts: Probably because of their position outside the core of legal reasoning, these types have been rather neglected if we look at the research in AI & Law. However, some of the expert systems in sentencing and calculating compensation claims (e.g. <ref> [Paul, 1991] </ref>) can be considered to address the representation of reactive knowledge. 3.5 Connections Between Categories So far, we have presented a set of categories that divide legal knowledge like pieces of a puzzle.

Reference-contexts: There is, however, some work on meta-norms in general, notably [D'Angelo et al., 1985] and [Hamfelt & Barklund, 1990]. There is also work on conflicts between (commanding) norms, e.g. <ref> [Prakken, 1991] </ref>. 3.2 Responsibility Knowledge Although it is relatively simple to verify the importance of causal reasoning in law, it is not equally simple to provide a more concrete account on how the causal aspects enter the realm of law.

Reference-contexts: Within AI & Law, there is a large amount of work devoted to the representation of world knowledge and particularly the open texture issue; examples are the early work of McCarty [McCarty & Sridharan, 1981] and Gardner's [Gardner, 1987] doctoral works. The formalization of the British Nationality Act by <ref> [Sergot et al., 1986] </ref> does not aim to treat open texture, but it deals essentially with world (and more specific terminological) knowledge | arguably, many other works in AI & Law (in particular the ones applying logic programming representations) do the same.

Reference-contexts: One of these modalities, the so-called deontic, have been subject to extensive research in the deontic logics, but this research is normally dissociated from broader ontological preoccupations with respect to law. The theoretical aims of the LEGOL project <ref> [Stamper, 1979] </ref> were similar to the ones we propose insofar as they also wanted to obtain a language to express legislation that could be used to interpret legislation as well, but their basic ontological primitive was still rules.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the main path in the picture can be also seen as the global structure of legal arguments: starting from the `facts of the case' and going up to sentencing, with each function providing the source (i.e. support knowledge in Toulmin's terms <ref> [Toulmin, 1969] </ref>) for argument steps in specific places within the global argument.

Reference-contexts: In principle, therefore, any of these formalisms can be used to represent and reason about commanding norms. In a forthcoming article <ref> [Valente & Breuker, 1993] </ref>, we propose a specific formalization of commanding norms as prohibitions, obligations and permissions over generic situations (generic descriptions of states of affairs in the world). Empowering norms in our ontology refer to the normative power (i.e. the power to posit norms) that an individual may have.

Reference-contexts: These legal provisions embed a notion of what is to be legally responsible, and whether causation should be taken as a necessary or sufficient reason for such concept to apply. We discuss the role of responsibility and causal knowledge in details in <ref> [Valente, 1993] </ref>. 3.3 World Knowledge By its very nature, law deals with behaviour in the world, and therefore must use some mechanism to describe this behaviour. For instance, norms must describe how things are or how things are not in this world. <p> That is, legal reasoning can be made modular, with each function corresponding to a module and the dependencies between the modules being provided by the dependencies between the functions. Such dependencies must of course be detailed; for instance, in <ref> [Valente, 1993] </ref> we formalize the connection between responsibility and causal knowledge.
