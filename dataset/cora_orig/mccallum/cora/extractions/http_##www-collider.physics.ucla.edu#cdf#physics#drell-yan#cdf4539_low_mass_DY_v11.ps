Abstract: We present a preliminary analysis of the Drell-Yan differential cross section, d 2 =dMdy, in both dielectron and dimuon channels. We study dileptons in the invariant mass range 11 &lt; M &lt; 150 GeV/c 2 , and within the rapidity region jyj &lt; 1. The only previous measurement of low mass Drell-Yan at CDF was from the 1988-89 data run [1] .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The most recent analysis of low mass Drell-Yan at CDF has been from Run 0 <ref> [1] </ref> . The results published were dominated by statistical uncertainties, yet seemed to indicate a factor of two discrepancy between dimuon and dielectron cross sections. With the use of a much larger data sample from Run 1B, we hope to investigate this discrepancy with a more precise measurement. <p> This changed the acceptance measurement and the cross section results. * Fixed reference to Run 0 Physical Review D paper <ref> [1] </ref> . 3 Dilepton Selection The dataset used in our analysis was taken from the SUSY dilepton sample of J.P. Done, et al. [2] .

Done, et al. <ref> [2] </ref> . This sample consists of 457,478 events from Run 1B, with corresponding electron and muon integrated luminosities of 88.6 pb 1 and 81.2 pb 1 , respectively. Integrated luminosities were calculated using LUM CONTROL, which removes most bad runs.

Reference-contexts: The inefficiency can be ascribed to the average prescale factor of 1:74, as well as to inefficiency in the CFT requirements. Figure 33 (bottom) shows the trigger efficiency turn-on curve for the Level 3 muon trigger (MU OB CMU CM P 8). Average prescale factors were determined by SIGMON <ref> [3] </ref> . The combined L1*L2*L3 trigger efficiency turn-on curves were fit to error (erf) functions. The uncertainties in the first parameter of the fit, i.e. the plateau efficiency level, were propagated into the statistical uncertainties in trigger acceptances.

Reference-contexts: The resulting trigger efficiencies can be found in Table 6. 5.2 Selection Efficiency For some of the relevant selection criteria, the identification efficiencies were taken from previously published CDF results. The electron ID efficiency (82 4%) was taken from CDF Note 4224 <ref> [4] </ref> as measured using J= ! e + e events. The muon ID efficiency (95 1%) was found in CDF Note 3715 [5] , and was measured with J= ! events. Track-finding efficiencies for the muon chambers were found in CDF Note 4423 [6] .
