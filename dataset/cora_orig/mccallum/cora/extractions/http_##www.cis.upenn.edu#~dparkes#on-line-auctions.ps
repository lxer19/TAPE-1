Abstract: Many auction mechanisms, including first and second-price ascending and sealed-bid auctions, have been proposed and analyzed in the economics literature. We compare the usefulness of different mechanisms for on-line auctions, focusing on the cognitive costs placed on users (e.g. the cost of determining the value of a good), the possibilities for agent mediation, and the trust properties of the auction. Different auction formats prove to be attractive for agent-mediated on-line auctions than for traditional off-line auctions. For example, second-price sealed-bid auctions are attractive in traditional auctions because they avoid the communication cost of multiple bids in first-price ascending auctions, and the "gaming" required to estimate the second highest bid in first-price sealed-bid auctions. However, when bidding agents are cheap, communication costs cease to be important, and a progressive auction mechanism is preferred over a closed-bid auction mechanism, since bidders with semi-autonomous agents can avoid the cognitive cost of placing an accurate value on a good. As another example, when an on-line auction is being conducted by a non-trusted auctioneer (e.g. the auctioneer is selling their own items), rational participants will build bidding agents that transform second-price auctions into first-price auctions.

Reference-contexts: Artificial bidding agents can represent the preferences of consumers, consumers can be physically distributed, bidding is electronic, and auction clearing is fully automatic. Auctions are just a first step towards more sophisticated negotiation for electronic commerce <ref> (Beam et. al. 1996) </ref>. The design of mechanisms and bidding agents for on-line auctions should be informed by the costs placed on human participants, the possibilities for effective agent mediation, and also by the trust properties of the auction. <p> In a traditional off-line auction this includes the cost of getting all the bidders together in the same place on the same day. The distinction between single-shot and repeated mechanisms in agent-mediated auctions is less important because communication costs are much lower than in off-line auctions <ref> (Beam et al. 1996) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Agent-mediated negotiation absorbs many of the costs, and on-line retail allows bidding-agents to readily negotiate with many sellers. First-generation shopping agents compare the price of goods over fixed-price retail sites. A natural extension is to allow agents to dynamically negotiate terms of agreement <ref> (Guttman and Maes 1998) </ref>. The design of market-aware computational agents presents a key challenge for agent technologies and artificial intelligence in general (Wellman and Wurman 1997). Market mechanisms can be designed to enable simple and provably optimal agent strategies in simple domains (Varian 1995). <p> Auctions are simply well-defined sets of rules for negotiation. Traditional auctions allow negotiation over price alone, which is clearly undesirable in a marketplace with simultaneous auctions over dissimilar goods, for example goods with different warranties or service policies <ref> (Guttman and Maes 1998) </ref>. Auction protocols can however be extended to permit wider negotiation, still within a framework that allows for the possibility of insincere agents and strategic behavior.

Reference-contexts: Traditional auction theory emphasizes the allocation efficiency and expected revenue properties of different auction types, given different assumptions about how a bidder's value of a good is formed <ref> (McAfee and McMillan 1987) </ref>. <p> The English auction maximizes revenue for sellers because bids reveal information <ref> (McAfee and McMillan 1987) </ref>, and the knowledge that one bidder values the item highly may increase the valuations of the other bidders. A sealed-bid auction does not allow dynamic information sharing between bidding agents.
