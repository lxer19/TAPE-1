Abstract: One of the major attractions of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks for transporting bursty video traffic is its ability to exploit the multiplexing gains of packet switching, while providing quality of service guarantees. Unfortunately, most of the multiplexing mechanisms proposed in the literature fail to exploit this feature. We propose a multirate service mechanism that allows a session to be served at different rates at different of times. Applications generating bursty data, such as VBR video, can take advantage of multirate service by requesting for a peak rate of service for brief periods of bursty arrivals and a much lower average rate of service for all other times. Consequently, the applications can improve their delay performance without reserving peak bandwidth for the entire duration of the sessions. Furthermore, the scheduler can multiplex the peaks and the lulls in service rates of different sessions and there by increasing the utilization of the system. Using MPEG video traces from a number of applications, we show that our scheme outperforms Packet-by-packet Generalized Processor Sharing (PGPS) in terms of number of connections admitted, while providing the same level of service guarantees. We also investigate the performance of multirate service when service quality need not be guaranteed. We refer to this as predictive service. We propose a measurement based admission control procedure for predictive service and show that it helps increase the size of the admissible region even further.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the major attractions of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks is its ability to exploit the multiplexing gains of packet switching, while providing quality of service guarantees. A number of service architectures have been proposed <ref> [1] </ref> to realize this goal. At the heart of all of these service architectures is a multiplexing policy that is used to allocate link capacities to competing connections at the switching nodes.

Reference-contexts: The end-to-end delay is computed as the sum of the delays at the switching nodes on the path of the connection. The multiplexing disciplines providing throughput guarantees <ref> [2, 5, 12, 19, 16, 15, 14] </ref> typically use variations of fair queueing or frame based scheduling to guarantee a minimum rate of service at each switching node.

Reference-contexts: Multiplexing mechanisms proposed for ATM networks can be broadly classified into two classes: (a) ones that provide guarantees on maximum delay at the switching nodes, and (b) ones that guarantee a minimum throughput. The multiplexing disciplines providing delay guarantees <ref> [18, 3] </ref> typically use static or dynamic priority based scheduling to bound the worst case delay of a connection at each switching node. The end-to-end delay is computed as the sum of the delays at the switching nodes on the path of the connection.

Reference-contexts: We propose a measurement based admission control procedure for predictive service and show that it helps increase the size of the admissible region even further. Except for some very recent works, multirate service mechanisms have not undergone a very through investigation. In <ref> [4] </ref> a hop-by-hop shaping mechanism is proposed. It can be adapted to provide multirate service. However, the impact of this service mechanism on real life application traffic is not addressed. A multiple time scale characterization of traffic has been proposed in [9, 8].

Reference-contexts: In the predictive service, the same admission control process is administered with the difference that instead of worst case estimate, we use a measurement based estimate of traffic arrivals <ref> [7] </ref>. Using MPEG video traces from a variety of real life applications (including news clips, basketball games, class lecture, and music videos), we have shown that multirate scheduling outperforms PGPS in terms of number of connections admitted, while providing the same level of service guarantees.

Reference-contexts: While a fixed rate of service is adequate for constant bit rate traffic, it is quite unsuitable for bursty traffic, such as variable bit rate (VBR) video. For example, an MPEG <ref> [10] </ref> coded video stream generates traffic at significantly different rates at different times and no single rate service is sufficient to transport it across the network. We propose a multirate service mechanism to address this problem. In our scheme, a connection is served at different rates at different times.

Reference-contexts: So far we have focused on characterizing traffic coming out of shapers and entering the network. The more difficult problem is to choose appropriate shaper parameters given the characterization of the traffic source <ref> [11] </ref>. We assume that the source is orchestrated, that is we know exact form of the traffic generated by the source.

However, the techniques developed here can be extended to moving and jumping window shapers also. A leaky bucket shaper consists of a token counter and a timer.
