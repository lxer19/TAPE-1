Abstract: The goal of this paper is the presentation of a new algorithm for determining etch rate from single or multiple wavelength reflectometry data. This algorithm is based on techniques from recursive nonlinear estimation theory | Extended Kalman Filtering. A major advantage of our algorithm is extremely high speed. Consequently, it can be used in real-time feedback control applications. The speed advantage also makes it a suitable candidate for full wafer high speed etch rate measurement.

Reference-contexts: Less than one msec on a Pentium PC Theory Our approach is based on estimation techniques developed in the systems and control community over the past 30 years <ref> [1] </ref>. In this approach, we form a dynamic model relating the various physical variables of interest such as etch depth, etch rate, reflected light intensity, etc. <p> The optimal estimation problem for the case when f; g are nonlinear remains unsolved, but there are several practical approaches which yield suboptimal performance. The technique we will use in this application will be Extended Kalman Filtering <ref> [1] </ref>, or EKF, which is a recursive algorithm. The recursive structure allows simple computations, as only new data is operated upon to produce a new estimate; all old data can be thrown away.

Reference-contexts: Simple models for r for smooth thin films are well known [5], and extensions for effects such as surface roughness have also been developed <ref> [2] </ref>. For use in ellipsometry, similar models have also been developed for the case of polarized light reflection [3]. The development of such models is not the focus of this paper, rather we concentrate on developing algorithms to extract depth or etch rate once such a model has been given.

Reference-contexts: A chopper and lock-in amplifier were used for noise reduction. The reflectometry was setup on an Applied 8300 Hexode reactive ion etcher in the University of Michigan solid state laboratory. CF 4 was used as the feed gas. For comparison, spectral reflectometry data <ref> [4] </ref> was taken as well. This consisted of a broad band source, with reflected light intensity measured at 798 wavelengths between 400 and 800nm. Depth estimates were found by a least squares fit to these wavelengths, and an etch rate estimate through a linear fit to the depth estimate.

For both simulation and experiment the etched material was SiO 2 over a Si substrate. The model for r (d) was standard: assuming homogeneous isotropic thin films as given in <ref> [5] </ref>. The angle of incidence was normal to the wafer surface. The simulations contain results for both single and dual wavelengths, however the experimental results only concern the single wavelength case.

Reference-contexts: Once the system is in this form, the problem becomes estimation of the state x from the measurement of y. If f; g are linear, and the noise signals are Gaussian processes, the optimal estimation problem was solved more than 30 years ago <ref> [8] </ref> and is the well known Kalman filter. The optimal estimation problem for the case when f; g are nonlinear remains unsolved, but there are several practical approaches which yield suboptimal performance.
