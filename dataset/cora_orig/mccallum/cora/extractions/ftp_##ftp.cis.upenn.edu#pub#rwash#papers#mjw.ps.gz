Abstract: An agent operating in a real-world environment will inevitably encounter some events that demand very quick response|the deadline for an action is short, and the consequences of not acting are high. For these types of events, the agent has a better chance of acting appropriately if it has a pre-stored set of reactions that can be quickly retrieved based on features of the situation. In this paper, we examine the problem of selecting the best set of reactions for an agent to store. In particular, we examine the benefit of including intervals of reactions|i.e., executing some reactions only across segments of the complete numeric ranges over which they are defined. We present a decision-theoretic algorithm for selecting the optimal set of reaction intervals, and we present experiments with a computer implementation of that algorithm, called Kneejerk. The experiments show that the benefit of breaking down reactions into intervals is quite high under a wide range of circumstances.

Reference-contexts: Currently, Kneejerk uses a branch-and-bound search to find the optimal set. We have also implemented a polynomial-time solution using three-dimensional dynamic programming, which allows slightly larger problems to be solved. For very large problems, it may be desirable to use an approximation technique such as simulated annealing <ref> (Aarts & Korst 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Universal plans (Schoppers 1987) organize reactions into a decision tree for retrieval, but there is just one reaction per situation, and all reactions are always included. Also, the cost of retrieval time is not modeled or reasoned about. Ash <ref> (Ash & Hayes-Roth 1993) </ref> organizes a set of reactions, with potentially multiple reactions per event, into a decision tree so as to optimize their retrieval, but again all reactions are included. We are interested in choosing a subset of reactions such that the overall utility is optimized.

Reference-contexts: One important reason is that the time to retrieve a reaction given a situation will increase with the number of reactions stored, and thus storing more reactions lessens the ability of the agent to react to time-critical events. Researchers (e.g., <ref> (Dabija 1993) </ref>) have begun to deal with this difficulty by attacking what we will call the reaction selection problem: given a set of events the agent might encounter and a set of actions appropriate for those events, select before execution time a subset of the events/actions for the agent to store <p> Related Work The work presented in this paper is built on the work of Dabija <ref> (Dabija 1993) </ref>. With the specific problem we address, we extend that work in several important ways. In our work, the utility value of a reaction is defined as a continuous utility function of parameters characterizing the situation, whereas for Dabija, each reaction has a single utility value.

Reference-contexts: In (Horvitz 1988), a model is presented of the utility of partial results under resource bounds; this is used in (Horvitz, Cooper, & Heckerman 1989) to decide between planning and action.

Utilities can also be used to provide search control for the planning process itself (Williamson & Hanks 1994).

Reference-contexts: One possible approach to storing reactions would be to store all of the system's possible actions as reactions (Schoppers 1987).

One important reason is that the time to retrieve a reaction given a situation will increase with the number of reactions stored, and thus storing more reactions lessens the ability of the agent to react to time-critical events.

Reference-contexts: Another important difference is that we incorporate the resources consumed by adding extra actions (in the form of delayed response time) into our model, thus making utility and resource requirements mutually dependent.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the agent merely needs to retrieve and execute the reaction once it has sensed that the event has occurred. One possible approach to storing reactions would be to store all of the system's possible actions as reactions <ref> (Schoppers 1987) </ref>. However, this approach is computationally intractable in terms of both time and space (Ginsberg 1989). <p> Dabija provides a greedy algorithm that is not optimal. Second, we use the decision-theoretic utility model for evaluating alternative reaction sets, as compared to a more parameter-specific evaluation model. Universal plans <ref> (Schoppers 1987) </ref> organize reactions into a decision tree for retrieval, but there is just one reaction per situation, and all reactions are always included. Also, the cost of retrieval time is not modeled or reasoned about.

Reference-contexts: Introduction An agent operating in a real-world environment will be faced with many external events that require a quick response. An autonomous robot <ref> (Thorpe et al. 1991) </ref> will have to deal with sudden obstacles posing threats to its own safety and the safety of other entities in its environment. A medical monitoring system (Hayes-Roth et al. 1992) will have to deal with sudden changes in the patient's condition necessitating speedy diagnosis and treatment.

Reference-contexts: This paper reports on our study of two key facets of this problem: 1. How to apply utility theory (recently applied to other planning problems, e.g., <ref> (Williamson & Hanks 1994) </ref>) to the problem of building a useful reaction set for an agent. 2. Improving the behavior of the agent by dividing reactions into sets of reaction intervals, so the agent can take different actions to the same (qualitative) event based on quantitative parameters characterizing that event. <p> A model of partial results is used in (Dean & Boddy 1988) to guarantee incremental improvements over time when planning may be cut off. Utilities can also be used to provide search control for the planning process itself <ref> (Williamson & Hanks 1994) </ref>. In contrast, we use utilities to select a partial set of reactions that will be optimal with respect to the possible events in each situation. The reaction selection problem can be seen as an instance of the utility problem (Minton 1990).
