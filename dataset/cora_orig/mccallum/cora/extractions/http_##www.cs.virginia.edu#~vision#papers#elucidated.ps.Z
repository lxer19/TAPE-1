Abstract: The term marker as used in the active vision and reactive planning literature is poorly defined. The underspecifica-tion of the marker concept limits the usefulness of this important tool for building perception and action systems for autonomous robots. This paper refines the concept of markers, both at the level of their role in perception-action system, and the the level of the representations used in their implementation. Our definition encompasses markers in dynamic 3D environments, which are retained even when not in the current perceptual input, either due to occlusion, a limited field of view, or sensing errors. We develop methods for maintaining the representation in the face of these difficulties. The marker concept is further elaborated by a categorization of marker types we have found useful in our research. Relationships among markers are also discussed: relationships which potentially form a link between classical and reactive planning. Finally, we describe a marker-based implementation of an autonomous agent performing search and avoidance tasks in a three-dimensional virtual environment.

Reference-contexts: The information stored in the set of markers is the primary input to a reactive planner responsible for immediate action determination. This approach has been successful in 2D environments <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. This paper elaborates the concept of markers, and extends the marker-based approach to representation of local space in dynamic 3D environments. Occlusion and a limited field of view in 3-space prevent straightforward application of a 2D system. <p> This agent is modelled after a small creature such as a rabbit that searches for food and must also avoid predators. Section 7 finishes with some conclusions drawn from our work. 2. Related work Agre and Chapman introduced deictic, or pointing representations to the reactive planning literature <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. They implemented an agent that used deictic representations to play a video game called Pengi. Rather than identify and label all the objects in the game, as would be the case in the classical planning paradigm, markers were placed on only the nearest (or otherwise most task-relevant) items.

Reference-contexts: The natural coordinate system for acting in the world is egocentric, and furthermore, is centered on the effector taking the action. This idea is well known in the active vision community <ref> [3] </ref>; e.g., if an effector is a manipulator grasping an object, the correct direction to move the effector is given by the signs of the coordinates of the object in the manipulator coordinate system.

Reference-contexts: We have found that an incorrect representation is worse than no representation at all, since it encourages the agent to confidently take an action that is not at all appropriate in the current circumstances. Brooks reports that adding representation to an agent usually decreased the competence of the robots <ref> [4] </ref>; we believe his observation is a result of this phenomenon. Representation is not intrinsically badits only bad if its wrong. It is therefore critical that the representation be maintained accurately, or discarded. 5.1.

Also, markers were placed only on currently visible objects; no state was retained concerning off screen items <ref> [5] </ref>. Maja Mataric developed the use of maps in a reactive planning context [10]. Sonar sensors and a low-resolution digital compass were used to identify landmarks and construct a topological map of the environment.

Reference-contexts: Note that this policy enables the maintenance and deletion of hypothesized object markers without any special machinery. 6. Implemented system We have implemented a marker based control system that illustrates many of the concepts developed above. Using virtual reality rapid prototyping software developed at UVa <ref> [6] </ref>, we created an environment with trees, rocks, berries, and walls. An agent survives in this environment by eating berries, and avoiding obstacles. Furthermore, the environment contains a predator which actively seeks out the agent. The agent has the concurrent goals of finding food, avoiding obstacles, and avoiding the predator.

Reference-contexts: Reaching the intermediate destination triggers a reevaluation of the obstacleness of the associated object with respect to the primary destination. As the domain becomes increasingly complex, this pattern can be extended to hierarchies of markers. These hierarchies bear resemblance to the classic concept of a partially ordered plan <ref> [7] </ref>, with dependent markers analogous to steps in the plan. Further research is needed to determine the full relationship of marker hierarchies to partially ordered plans. Marker hierarchies may potentially bridge the gap between reactive and classical planning, at least for navigation tasks.

Reference-contexts: The strategy described above must be augmented to notice the occlusion of marked objects and behave appropriately. The technique we used is similar to Horswills obstacle avoidance routine <ref> [8] </ref>, in that it relies only on being able to segment the ground from non-ground (i.e., obstacles). To determine if a marked object is occluded, points on the ground/non-ground boundary are converted to egocentric 3D coordinates and compared with coordinates of the marker.

Reference-contexts: Image coordinate markers are placed on objects in the current image, and are used to facilitate visual routines. They mark objects such as edges, lines, terminations, etc. They may either be bottom-up or top-down. Bottom-up image-coordinate markers make up a set of items similar to Marrs raw primal sketch <ref> [9] </ref>. Top-down image-coordinate markers correspond to the markers in Ullmans visual routines [12]. Egocentric 3D markers are the focus of our research; all markers discussed in the remainder of this paper will be in egocentric 3D coordinates.

Reference-contexts: Topological maps are useful for navigating the large-scale space, while local representations are used for coping with the immediate surroundings. In this way, the two representations are complimentary. Andrew McCallum conducted experiments with deictic representations in a virtual environment <ref> [11] </ref>. He constructed a go-cart simulator, for virtual driving to investigate the role of deictic visual behaviors. His work is primarily concerned with the use of the fovea as a marker, and the learning of the visual behaviors.

When the visual system has processed the input enough to determine what and where a task-critical object is in the environment, a marker is instantiated.

Classical and reactive planning have complementary strengths and weaknesses. </editor> <title> Autonomous agents operating in real physical environments using visual perception must combine the strengths of both approaches to successfully perform useful tasks. Marker-based representations have the potential for bridging the gap between classical and reactive planning.
