Abstract: Quo Vadis is a heuristic approach to routing in a modern communication environment consisting of a very large number of nodes. It is aimed at the elimination of expensive and unwieldy routing tables thereby reducing avoidable message overhead. Routing decisions are based on parameterized knowledge representation and heuristics which encode a limited view of the network as seen from each of the nodes. This forms the basis for future work on learning mechanisms that can be used to determine suitable parameter settings thereby making the network adaptive and hence responsive to complex net work dynamics.

Reference-contexts: For example, the farther a message is from its final destination, the greater is the likelihood of having different paths of comparable quality (with respect to the particular metric used) available for routing a message towards its destination <ref> [1] </ref>. This leads to one of the key ideas behind Quo Vadis, namely, to utilize local state information in conjunction with a less precise view, a summary, of the state of the entire network. <p> As with knowledge representation, the choice of a particular decision strategy will always introduce bias. Its quality must be evaluated with respect to a given network topology. 3 Simulation and Preliminary Results The experimental design of Quo Vadis involves the simulation of a very large communication environment <ref> [1] </ref>. Several experiments have been and are being conducted in a regular grid topology environment. Simulations of Quo Vadis with regular rectangular grid networks display a variety of promising results.
