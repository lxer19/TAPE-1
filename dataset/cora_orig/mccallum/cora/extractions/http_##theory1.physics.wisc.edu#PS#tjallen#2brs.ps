Abstract: A new `harmonic' BRST method is presented for quantizing those dynamical systems having second-class constraints which split into holomorphic and antiholo-morphic algebras. These theories include those whose phase spaces are coadjoint orbits of a compact semisimple Lie group. The method also applies to theories with holomorphic first-class constraints which have nonvanishing brackets with their an-tiholomorphic conjugates. An operatorial quantization, resembling supersymmetric quantum mechanics, is presented. In addition, a general path integral is given and is shown to reduce to that given by Batalin, Fradkin, and Vilkovisky.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Certain constrained systems, notably the D = 10 harmonic superstring and su-perparticle [1,2], the Brink-Schwarz superparticle in four dimensions [2,3], and certain coadjoint orbit theories such as particle spin dynamics on a Lie group <ref> [4] </ref>, admit the separation of the second-class constraints into two sets, one holomorphic and one an-tiholomorphic, each of which not only closes under Poisson brackets with itself, but has the property that either set and the first-class constraints together are also closed under Poisson brackets. <p> SU (2) Particle Spin Dynamics As a toy system we consider the action for a particle spin written in terms of group variables <ref> [4] </ref>, g 2 SU (2), I spin = i Z Being first-order in time derivatives, this model is reparametrization invariant and has its dynamics determined solely by its constraints. These constraints are J 1 0; J 3 0; where the J i are the generators of right translations of g. <p> The first two are obviously second-class while the last is first-class, and generates the only gauge invariance of the model: g ! g e ifi (t) 3 . In the Gupta-Bleuler method for quantizing this system <ref> [4] </ref>, there are nontrivial physical states only when is an integer. <p> The action is similar to the spin case. I G = i dt Tr (Kg 1 _g): (4:1) Here K is some fixed Lie algebra element of the group G. The constraints of this model <ref> [4] </ref> are the various components of I R + K 0 where I R is the generator of G acting on the right. <p> The K () may be chosen to satisfy Tr ( K ()K) = 0 and form an algebra by themselves. The second-class constraints are the remaining components Tr (E ff I R ) 0; (4:3) with E ff 2 C ? K . As explained in ref. <ref> [4] </ref>, there must be conditions on K to ensure that the space of physical states in the Gupta-Bleuler approach is not empty. If K satisfies these conditions, then there will be a unique state in the representation of I R satisfying the constraints.

Reference-contexts: In these systems the holomorphic half of the second-class constraints may be implemented as if they were first-class. This is fine for operator quantization, but a BRST quantization is problematic, as the BRST charge would not be hermitian. Operatorial implementation of such BRST charges has been considered previously <ref> [5] </ref> but in a formalism with a larger number of ghosts. <p> Finally, the implementation of the harmonic BRST-BFV quantization in path integral form is discussed. 2. Harmonic States and Second-Class BRST charges The harmonic BRST-BFV method starts from the same point as ref. <ref> [5] </ref> but differs in its ghost structure. In order to make clear the method for dealing with second-class constraints we start first with a simple example.

Reference-contexts: In the Gupta-Bleuler method, one would impose the condition that the matrix elements of ^a and ^a y fl The construction of dynamical systems, especially two-dimensional gravity, directly from the coadjoint orbits of infinite dimensional or non-compact Lie groups is also possible <ref> [8] </ref>. 2 vanish between physical states. This would leave the vacuum state, j0i, as the only physical state. The harmonic BRST method introduces "ghost" operators ^ ~ and ^ ~ which are complex conjugates, anticommuting and canonical conjugates as well.

Reference-contexts: That is, the "Laplacian," iffi; fig = 2 ~~ + aa fl = 2 ~~ + p 2 + q 2 ; (2:3) is the OSp (1; 1j2) invariant quadratic form. We recall the Parisi-Sourlas relation <ref> [9] </ref>, Z for differentiable functions f which vanish at infinity. This gives meaning to the imprecise statement that the ~ and ~ have negative dimension and cancel the dynamical variables p and q.

Reference-contexts: Now these operators are adjoints of each 3 other, which must be reflected in the inner product. The correct inner product <ref> [10] </ref> on the ghost Hilbert space of quantum states (which are simply functions of the ghost coordinates ~) is (f; g) = d~ d ~ e ~ ~ f fl ( ~)g (~): (2:6) For this simple system one can prove an analog of the Hodge theorem.

Reference-contexts: We will use the rest of this section to argue its equivalence to the BFV path integral with second-class constraints <ref> [11] </ref> and, using it, to construct a more general path integral in the Batalin Fradkin-Vilkovisky form. There are restrictions on the gauge fermion in order that there be a BFV theorem guaranteeing the path integral's independence of the parameter fi and the gauge fermion .

Reference-contexts: There are many systems which have a holomorphic structure. All of these systems owe their holomorphic structures to some inherent group structure. The more general question of how to impose holomorphic constraints is also interesting. There are related questions, involving reality conditions <ref> [14] </ref>, in Ashtekar's new variables approach to gravity. The author knows of no characterization of the systems which admit harmonic BRST-BFV quantizations and conjectures that the method is applicable to systems more general than those following from a Lie group action.
