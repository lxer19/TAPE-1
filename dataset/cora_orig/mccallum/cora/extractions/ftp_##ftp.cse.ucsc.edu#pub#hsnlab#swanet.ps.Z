Title: SWANET: A Novel Self-Routed Wavelength-Addressable Optical Switching Network 1  
Author: A. Varma C. J. Chang-Hasnain K. Y. Lau J. W. Goodman M. S. Wu L. A. Buckman G. Giaretta and G. Jeong 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel self-routed wavelength-addressable switching network (SWANET) that provides wavelength-transparent optical data paths between end-points, configured by wavelength-coded optical signals. The network is based on a new scheme for encoding destination addresses using a sequence of wavelengths. This allows large networks to be constructed using a moderate number of available wavelengths. The multistage switch architecture may be used either as a circuit switch or as a packet switch. We analyze the effect of wavelength inaccuracies on the misrouting probability and show that our addressing scheme provides a much higher tolerance to wavelength variations in comparison to conventional wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). We also analyze the effect of fiber dispersion on the transmission time of the header and evaluate the tradeoffs involved in minimizing the header transmission time. Experimental results from a small prototype switch node are presented to establish the feasibility of the architecture. Performance results are also presented from simulations of a 256-port network in both circuit-switched and packet-switched modes of operation.

Reference-contexts: Single-mode optical fiber operating at a wavelength in the neighborhood of 1550 nm has a capacity of approximately 25,000 GHz, while electronic processing speeds are limited to a few Gbits/s <ref> [1] </ref>. This speed mismatch can be expected to prevail for a long time. The distinguishing characteristic of an all-optical network from today's communication networks is that the path between any two communicating end-points does not involve optical-to-electrical conversion of the high-speed data.

Reference-contexts: The intention is to avoid speed and data-format restrictions imposed by such conversions. Many categories of all-optical network architectures have been proposed in recent literature <ref> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>. These vary from simple broadcast-and-select architectures to networks based on ultrafast soliton switching. In this paper, we describe a novel self-routed wavelength-addressable switching network (SWANET) that provides wavelength-transparent data paths between end points.

In this paper, we describe a novel self-routed wavelength-addressable switching network (SWANET) that provides wavelength-transparent data paths between end points. <p> The switching function is achieved trivially in this case by performing a one-to-one mapping of an incoming wavelength to an output port. The LambdaNet <ref> [3] </ref> uses this approach. This type of routing does not allow much architectural scalability. Instead of using a single wavelength to encode the destination address, our approach in SWANET is to encode the destination address using a sequence of wavelengths [14]. This is illustrated in Figure 1. <p> This huge tolerance presents an excellent opportunity for cost-effective dense wavelength coding. The large wavelength tolerance marks a sharp contrast to the stringent requirement in a conventional WDM system <ref> [3] </ref>. The reason is fundamental and somewhat independent of the grating/wavelength demultiplexer used. In a WDM system, the signal is routed through a demultiplexer based on its wavelength. The output ports of a demultiplexer are an array of single mode fibers.

Reference-contexts: A crossbar is the ideal and most general form of a switching network. Optical crossbar networks, however, are difficult to scale beyond a small number of ports owing to a number of technological and architectural limitations <ref> [7] </ref>. Hence, a multistage architecture, consisting of smaller crossbars organized in stages, must be used to attain scalability. <p> Each switch node has k input ports and the same number of output ports. The switching network has the topology of a banyan network <ref> [7] </ref>, where a network with N ports is obtained by interconnecting m = log k N stages of k fi k switch nodes. We used the following guidelines in our design of the SWANET architecture: 1.

Reference-contexts: If larger switch nodes are used, multiple address bits must be read and decoded at each node; this requires some level of synchronization at the switch node, increasing its complexity of implementation. There have been other approaches using wavelengths to set up paths in a switching network <ref> [10, 11, 12] </ref>. However, these schemes differ from the addressing and routing approaches used in SWANET in a number of ways. First, these earlier schemes use the wavelength domain to separate control information from data.

In the earlier schemes control information is transmitted in parallel with the data. This requires delaying the data wavelengths in each switch node while the switch node is being set up <ref> [11] </ref>. In addition, in a multistage network, control and data channels need to be re-synchronized at each stage. In our scheme, on the other hand, the optical payload follows the header serially.

Reference-contexts: Fiber amplifiers are not essential for the range of distances covered by a LAN; consequently, wavelength regions other than 1550 nm could be used. The wavelength range of 850-950 nm is of interest because of the potential for low-cost optical devices becoming available <ref> [13] </ref>. With 10 wavelengths spaced 1 nm apart, and a dispersion coefficient of 30 ps/nm/km in this wavelength region, the maximum dispersion for a 1 km link is approximately 0.27 ns.

Reference-contexts: The LambdaNet [3] uses this approach. This type of routing does not allow much architectural scalability. Instead of using a single wavelength to encode the destination address, our approach in SWANET is to encode the destination address using a sequence of wavelengths <ref> [14] </ref>. This is illustrated in Figure 1. The data packet is preceded by an optical header consisting of a sequence of m address slots. This sequence encodes the address of the destination of the packet in the optical network as a sequence of wavelengths.

Reference-contexts: The header time can still be reduced in the average case using variable guard time and pulsewidth as in the case of a unicast packet. 6 Experimental Results To demonstrate the feasibility of the SWANET architecture, we have constructed a single switch node and performed experiments on it <ref> [15] </ref>. Figure 7 shows the block diagram of the experimental setup we used to demonstrate routing to a selected output of a 1 fi 4 router, and Figure 8 shows a photograph of the setup.

Reference-contexts: For a diffraction grating, the minimum fiber core separation is its cladding diameter and, thus, the ratio is only a few percent. Using a waveguide-routed demul-tiplexer <ref> [16] </ref>, the tolerance can be increased with a larger waveguide length difference (equivalent to the dispersion of a grating), which is limited by the chip size and acceptable bending angle of the waveguides.

Reference-contexts: The throughputs shown are normalized values based on the packet transmission times. As the load is increased, the throughput of the crossbar network saturates at approximately 0.5. Note that, although the maximum attainable throughput of an input-buffered crossbar switch with synchronous arrivals in close to 0.6 <ref> [17] </ref>, in practice the throughput is lower because of asynchronous arrivals. The SWANET configurations have lower throughput because of internal blocking within the switch fabric.
