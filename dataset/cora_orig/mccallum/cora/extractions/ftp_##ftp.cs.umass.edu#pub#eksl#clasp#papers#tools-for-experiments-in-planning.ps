Abstract: The paper describes two separate but synergistic tools for running experiments on large Lisp systems such as planning systems, by which we mean systems that produce plans and execute them in some kind of simulator. The first tool, called Clip (Common Lisp Instrumentation Package), allows the researcher to define and run experiments, including experimental conditions (values for parameters of the planner or simulator) and data to be collected. The data are written out to data files that can be analyzed by statistics software. The second tool, called Clasp (Common Lisp Analytical Statistics Package), allows the researcher to analyze data from experiments by using graphics, statistical tests, and various kinds of data manipulation. Clasp has a graphical user interface (using CLIM, the Common Lisp Interface Manager) and also allows data to be directly processed by Lisp functions.

Reference-contexts: Most multi-threaded lisps provide a process-wait function, which can be used to make the simulator seem like a single piece of code. 2 This article is no substitute for the Clip/Clasp manual <ref> [1] </ref>, where everything is rigorously explained. 3 which are specified here. The independent variables are specified with a simple syntax much like the Common Lisp loop macro. <p> Clip also lets you run only part of the experiment, which facilitates breaking the experiment into parts to run on different machines. These are all explained at length in the Clip/Clasp documentation <ref> [1] </ref>. An alternative to Clip is the METERS system, developed by Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc., for use in the ARPA/RL Planning Initiative's Common Prototyping Environment (CPE).

Reference-contexts: Most of these commands, such as the t-test, confidence intervals, Analysis of Variance, Chi-square and Regression, are described in any statistics textbook. One other, called the d-test may be unfamiliar, since it is a bootstrap statistic to compete with the t-test. Bootstrap statistics <ref> [2, 3] </ref> replace the parametric and distributional assumptions of statistics like the t-test with an empirical approach using computerized resampling of the data. The d-test is used just like the t-test, especially when the data don't satisfy the normality and equal-variance assumptions of the t-test.

The purpose of the experiment is to assess the error rate of a demon that predicts the queue length at a port d days in advance, as a function of the variability of ship speed and the time delay, d.
