Abstract: Classical Molecular Dynamics of polyatomic liquids involves a special treatment of the intramolecular bonds, which is not very well suited for massively parallel computers programmed in data-parallel style. An alternative approach, based on a `Multiple Time Scales' algorithm, is presented, which is fully data-parallel and energy-conserving with the same order in t as standard Verlet integration scheme. Results are given for codes written in CMFortran and tailored for the CM-200 simulating SPC water either with the Ewald sum method (all-pairs interactions) or with reaction field treatment of the long-range potential, allowing the usage of a coarse-grained cell method for the parallelization of the force calculations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a well-established simulation technique to infer the statistical and dynamical properties of an ensemble of molecules, given an appropriate form of the interaction potential <ref> [1] </ref>. In the framework of classical mechanics, a polyatomic molecule can be modeled by a set of point particles (atoms and massless `virtual sites'). Molecules interact via a site-site pairwise potential, including for example electrostatic and Van der Waals terms (`non-bonded' terms). <p> When one chooses h 0 = 1=2 P i =m i and h 1 = 1=2V (q) the well-known leapfrog update in the `velocity Verlet' <ref> [1] </ref> form is recovered.

The first method is based on writing Euler equation for a rigid body. Aside from the need of special treatment in order to avoid spurious singularities, this method rapidly becomes very cumbersome to manage if one wants to retain some internal degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) in a complex molecule. <p> The line shows the best fit which has slope 2:3 0:2 An apparent difficulty inherent in flexible models of polyatomic molecules is that `hard' d.o.f. are difficult to thermalise <ref> [2] </ref>. In particular, the vibrational kinetic energy is transfered relatively quickly to the translational d.o.f. (few tenths of ps for a periodic box of 512 water molecules), whereas the exchange in the opposite direction is much slower (several tens of ps).

Reference-contexts: This procedure is called SHAKE if the Verlet integration scheme is used <ref> [3] </ref>, similar procedures exist for other integration schemes. SHAKE solves each constraint in succession, looping iteratively over all constraints until convergence to a desired tolerance is reached. Therefore it is clearly a sequential algorithm on each molecule.

Reference-contexts: Therefore it is clearly a sequential algorithm on each molecule. Also, it is known that SHAKE may have problems of con vergence in some cases, requiring specific recasting of the constraints <ref> [4] </ref>. 3 The MTS Algorithm An alternative approach is based on reconsidering the argument about the time step needed to model the fast intramolecular motion, using a Multiple Time Scales (MTS) algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Leaving aside known methods to handle the O (N 2 ) interactions indirectly, such as multipole expansion and particle-mesh, we are left with a particle-particle treatment. This class of problems displays an intrinsic data-parallelism <ref> [7] </ref> that can be exploited in different ways on distributed-memory, massively parallel processors (MPP) machines, according to the ratio between the number of particles N and the number of (virtual) processors p available: 1. p ~ O (N 2 ) ) one processor per binary interaction; 2. p ~ O (N)

Reference-contexts: status in a ring which is cshifted N 1 times in order to pass the status to every other particle, accumulating the forces acting onto each particle (the last cshift would correspond to self-interaction, therefore it is skipped); this technique is also called `digital orrery' in the Thinking Machine parlance <ref> [8] </ref>. Case 3 corresponds to a coarse-grained parallelism with fewer processors, exploiting a spatial decomposition of the simulation box. It is feasible only for short-range forces, otherwise the efficiency is severely limited by the communications.

Reference-contexts: It is feasible only for short-range forces, otherwise the efficiency is severely limited by the communications. The scheme have been described elsewhere, a detailed explanation of its implementation on the CM-200 is in <ref> [9] </ref>. In both cases 2 and 3 it is possible to exploit Newton's third law cutting the force calculations by half, keeping track of the accumulated forces on an auxiliary array. <p> Clearly this could be carried over for more and more neigbors, eventually hitting the load-balancing or the communications limit. It is interesting to note here that the `particle-coloring' algorithm devised by <ref> [9] </ref> to save further interactions, have efficiencies 0 4.3 Bonded terms strategies Some more considerations are necessary to apply case 3 to polyatomic molecules.

We tested as intramolecular potential an harmonic one, with the parameters used in reference <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> This is to be compared with previous MTS schemes which can have drifts many hundred times higher <ref> [12] </ref>. The time steps used were t = 1 fs for the `slow' and t f = 0.1 fs for the `fast' forces, which gives a fluctuation of the total energy of approximately 1% of the fluctuation in the total potential energy, as commonly required.

Reference-contexts: We have found that the Maxwellian shu*e technique thermalise each degree of freedom at room temperature within 2 ps only. This technique consists in updating the velocities of all atoms with a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at the desired temperature every few time steps <ref> [14] </ref> (in our case, every 100 time steps of 1 fs).
