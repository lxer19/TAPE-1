Abstract: Virtual Trees (VTs) are source-rooted trees in ATM networks in which VCs originating at the source but going to different destinations can share some of the bandwidth pre-allocated to the VT, thus providing an additional multiplexing advantage over Virtual Paths (VPs). We propose two fast bandwidth allocation algorithms for both VTs and VPs that are approximate in the sense that they do not always yield optimal configurations. We describe the results of a simulation study which shows that Virtual Tree configurations have almost 40% lower cost than corresponding Virtual Path configurations. Applications of this work to dynamic routing schemes for battlefield wireless networks are outlined.

Reference-contexts: The Virtual Path concept provides several advantages such as allowing simpler network architectures, eliminating the need for call-by-call routing resulting in very short connection setup times, and allowing easier implementation of dynamic bandwidth allocation schemes <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]. In our previous work, we have extended this concept of Virtual Paths to propose a new technique called Virtual Trees that can be used for bandwidth allocation in ATM networks [3], [4].

In a Virtual Path, different Virtual Channels may share the bandwidth of the VP resulting in better multiplexing of the traffic than if the network allocated bandwidth individually for each VC <ref> [2] </ref>. Because of this multiplexing effect, a smaller amount of bandwidth may be allocated to the VP than the sum of the bandwidths of all VCs traversing it. Put another way, the Equivalent Bandwidth required by each VC decreases as more traffic is multiplexed on the same VP.

Reference-contexts: In our previous work, we have extended this concept of Virtual Paths to propose a new technique called Virtual Trees that can be used for bandwidth allocation in ATM networks <ref> [3] </ref>, [4]. A Virtual Tree (VT) corresponds to pre-allocated bandwidth along a set of links in the network that form a tree rooted at a source node and leading to various destinations. <p> There are several proposed algorithms that deal with the problem of finding such configurations [5], [6] given predicted traffic patterns between source-destination pairs and capacity constraints for the network links. We have previously proposed a bandwidth allocation model for Virtual Trees <ref> [3] </ref> that yields optimal VT configurations in a similar manner to VP configurations. One of the main difficulties in using these optimization models is that determining optimal configurations is an NP-Hard problem [7]. <p> Other desirable quality of service measures are delay and delay jitter, but these are harder to use in computing equivalent bandwidth. We have proposed a new technique called Virtual Trees (VTs) to be used in a manner similar to the way Virtual Paths are currently used [4], <ref> [3] </ref>. In VTs, there is pre-defined bandwidth available for use by a given source node, just as in VPs. <p> We have presented in <ref> [3] </ref> an optimization model that yields such a VT configuration. It has been shown that the problem of determining optimal configurations for Virtual Paths is NP-Hard [7]. Clearly, the algorithm to solve the optimization model for Virtual Trees is at least as hard.

Reference-contexts: In doing so, it is useful to refer to the term equivalent bandwidth which is the amount of bandwidth necessary to accommodate the aggregate traffic of a set of K bursty sources while complying with a specific quality of service <ref> [8] </ref>. The quality of service may be measured in terms of the buffer overflow probability or the cell loss probability. Other desirable quality of service measures are delay and delay jitter, but these are harder to use in computing equivalent bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: This again represents a 40% improvement for Virtual Trees over Virtual Paths. APPLICATION TO WIRELESS BATTLEFIELD NETWORKS Recently, Virtual Trees have been proposed to be used in two different contexts in wireless networks for managing handoff between mobile terminals and base stations. Acampora and Naghshineh <ref> [9] </ref> use a tree called a Virtual Connection Tree to modify existing VCs when a mobile node is handed off to a new base station.

Reference-contexts: However, their tree is not rooted at the source like our tree is and also uses distinct paths from the root to the base stations, thus not taking advantage of multiplexing over overlapping links. Veeraraghavan et al. <ref> [10] </ref> use a Virtual Sink Tree to find paths to a given destination. A Sink Tree is rooted at the destination instead of the source, and takes advantage of multiplexing over common links, 261 Fig. 3.

Reference-contexts: However, there are similar advantages in wireless networks of using source concatenation of packets flowing to different destinations. The MIL-STD-188-220A suite of protocols <ref> [11] </ref> being developed for Combat Net Radio (CNR) for digitized battlefields uses source concatenation at both the data link and physical layers.
