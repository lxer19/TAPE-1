Abstract: Random independent sets in graphs arise, for example, in statistical physics, in the hard-core model of a gas. A new rapidly mixing Markov chain for independent sets is defined in this paper. We show that it is rapidly mixing for a wider range of values of the parameter than the Luby-Vigoda chain, the best previously known. Moreover the new chain is apparently more rapidly mixing than the Luby-Vigoda chain for larger values of (unless the maximum degree of the graph is 4). An extension of the chain to independent sets in hypergraphs is described. This chain gives an efficient method for approximately counting the number of independent sets of hypergraphs with maximum degree two, or with maximum degree three and maximum edge size three. Finally, we describe a method which allows one, under certain circumstances, to deduce the rapid mixing of one Markov chain from the rapid mixing of another, with the same state space and stationary distribution. This method is applied to two Markov chains for independent sets, a simple insert/delete chain and the new chain, to show that the insert/delete chain is rapidly mixing for a much wider range of values of than was previously known.

Reference-contexts: The total variation distance of the Markov chain from at time t, with initial state x, is defined by d TV (P t 1 X jP t (x; y) (y)j: Following Aldous <ref> [1] </ref>, let t x (") denote the least value T such that d TV (P t x ; ) " for all t T . The mixing time of M, denoted by t ("), is defined by t (") = max ft x (") : x 2 g. <p> One such method is coupling. A coupling for M is a stochastic process (X t ; Y t ) on fi such that each of (X t ), (Y t ), considered marginally, is a faithful copy of M. The Coupling Lemma (see for example, Aldous <ref> [1] </ref>) states that the total variation distance of M at time t is bounded above by Prob [X t 6= Y t ], the probability that the process has not coupled. The difficulty in applying the Coupling Lemma lies in obtaining an upper bound for this probability.

Luby and Vigoda used the coupling method to establish the rapid mixing of their chain. <p> Luby and Vigoda used the coupling method to establish the rapid mixing of their chain. Here we state tighter bounds on the mixing time of the Luby-Vigoda chain which can be established using the path coupling method <ref> [3] </ref>. Then a new Markov chain for independent sets is defined which is an improvement on the Luby-Vigoda chain in two areas. The new chain is rapidly mixing for a wider range of values of than the Luby-Vigoda chain. <p> The difficulty in applying the Coupling Lemma lies in obtaining an upper bound for this probability. In the path coupling method, introduced by Bubley and Dyer <ref> [3] </ref> , one need only define and analyse a coupling on a subset S of fi . Choosing 3 the set S carefully can considerably simplify the arguments involved in proving rapid mixing by coupling. The path coupling method is described in the next theorem, taken from [9].

Reference-contexts: Now consider the problem of counting independent sets in hypergraphs with maxi mum degree 3 and maximum edge size 3. We now sketch a proof that counting independent sets in graphs of maximum degree 3 is #P -complete (for full details see <ref> [10] </ref>). Theorem 4.2 Let #INDEPENDENT-SETS (3) denote the following counting problem. An instance is a graph with maximum degree three and the problem is to calculate the number of independent sets in that graph. Then #INDEPENDENT-SETS (3) is #P - complete. Sketch of proof. <p> This disproves the (admittedly rather unlikely) conjecture that the counting problem #3-3MON is #P -complete because of the possible presence of edges of size two.

Reference-contexts: The two main tasks are evaluating the partition function and sampling according to the probability distribution . Both of these problems can be solved using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method wherever a rapidly mixing Markov chain for independent sets is available (see, for example <ref> [13] </ref>). The simplest Markov chain for independent sets is the so called insert/delete chain. This chain was only known to be rapidly mixing for small values of . A slightly more complicated chain was proposed by Luby and Vigoda [15]. <p> For 3 the tasks of approximately evaluating Z () and approximately sampling from I (G) according to can be performed using a rapidly mixing Markov chain with state space I (G) and stationary distribution . For a description of how this can be achieved, see for example <ref> [13] </ref>. The simplest Markov chain on I (G) which converges to the stationary distribution is the so-called insert/delete chain. <p> An independent set in L () corresponds to a matching in : that is, a set of edges no two of which are adjacent. The Markov chain M (I (G)) defined above corresponds almost exactly to the Markov chain on matchings described in <ref> [13, p. 495] </ref>. We conclude this section by comparing our improved upper bounds for the mixing time of the Luby-Vigoda chain LV (I (G)) and the upper bounds for the mixing time of the new chain M (I (G)), as given in Theorems 2.3, 3.1 respectively.
