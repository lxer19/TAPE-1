Abstract: More and more firms are marching to the drumbeat of Business Process Reengineering (BPR) and Workflow Management (WFM). This trend exposes the need for techniques for the construction and analysis of business procedures. In this paper we focus on a class of Petri nets suitable for the representation, validation and verification of these procedures. We will show that the correctness of a procedure represented by such a Petri net can be verified in polynomial time. Based on this result we provide a comprehensive set of transformation rules which can be used to construct and modify correct procedures.

Reference-contexts: This property is called the soundness property. In this paper we present a technique to verify this property in polynomial time. This technique is based on the rich theory developed for free-choice Petri nets (cf. Best <ref> [6] </ref>, Desel and Esparza [12]). BP-nets have some interesting properties. <p> Definition 6 (Free-choice) A Petri net is a free-choice Petri net iff, for every two places p 1 and p 2 either . p 1 * " p 2 */ D ; or p 1 * D p 2 *. Free-choice Petri nets have been studied extensively (cf. Best <ref> [6] </ref>, Desel and Es-parza [12, 11, 13], Hack [14]) because they seem to be a good compromise between expressive power and analyzability. It is a class of Petri nets for which strong theoretical results and efficient analysis techniques exist.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, the places i and o are not in P X . Therefore, P X is also a trap of P N . In state ni there are no tokens in trap P X . By using the Home marking theorem (cf. Best, Desel and Esparza <ref> [7] </ref>), we deduce that ni is not a home marking of .P N ; ni/. However, state i is a home marking of .P N ; i/ and ni is also a home marking of .P N ; ni/.

Reference-contexts: The complexity of the algorithm to construct the cov--erability graph can be worse than primitive recursive space. Even for free-choice Petri nets the reachability problem is known to be EXPSPACE-hard (cf. Cheng, Esparza and Palsberg <ref> [9] </ref>). Therefore, any `brute-force approach' to check soundness is bound to be intractable. Fortunately, the problem of deciding whether a given BP-net is sound is tractable. In the remainder of this section, we present a technique to decide soundness in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: It is not difficult to map a procedure onto a Petri net. As it turns out, we can even restrict ourselves to a subclass of Petri nets. Representatives of this class are called Business-Procedure nets (BP-nets). A BP-net is a free-choice Petri net (Desel and Esparza <ref> [12] </ref>) with two special places: i and o. These places are used to mark the begin and the end of a procedure, see figure 1. The tasks are modeled by transitions and the partial ordering of tasks is modeled by places connecting these transitions. <p> This property is called the soundness property. In this paper we present a technique to verify this property in polynomial time. This technique is based on the rich theory developed for free-choice Petri nets (cf. Best [6], Desel and Esparza <ref> [12] </ref>). BP-nets have some interesting properties. <p> Free-choice Petri nets have been studied extensively (cf. Best [6], Desel and Es-parza <ref> [12, 11, 13] </ref>, Hack [14]) because they seem to be a good compromise between expressive power and analyzability. It is a class of Petri nets for which strong theoretical results and efficient analysis techniques exist. <p> Therefore .P N ; i/ is deadlock-free. Since .P N ; i/ is a deadlock-free, bounded, strongly connected, free-choice Petri net, we deduce that .P N ; i/ is live (see theorem 4.31 11 in Desel and Esparza <ref> [12] </ref>). P N is a so-called well-formed net. Since every well--formed free-choice Petri net has a positive place-invariant, we deduce that P N is conservative. fl Theorem 1 A BP-net P N is sound if and only if .P N ; i/ is live and conservative. Proof. <p> Corollary 1 A BP-net P N is sound if and only if .P N ; i/ is live and bounded. Proof. A live free-choice Petri net is bounded iff it is conservative (cf. Desel and Esparza <ref> [12] </ref>). fl Perhaps surprisingly, the verification of the soundness property boils down to checking whether the extended Petri net is live and bounded! As a direct result of the Rank theorem ([8, 12]), it is possible to decide liveness and boundedness in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: Since then the use and study of Petri nets has increased considerably. For a review of the history of Petri nets and an extensive bibliography the reader is referred to Murata <ref> [17] </ref>. The classical Petri net is a directed bipartite graph with two node types called places and transitions. The nodes are connected via directed arcs. Connections between two nodes of the same type are not allowed. Places are represented by circles and transitions by rectangles. <p> The soundness property is a property which relates to the dynamics of a BP-net. Therefore, the coverability graph (Peterson [18], Murata <ref> [17] </ref>) seems to be an obvious technique to check whether the BP-net is sound. Figure 3 shows the coverability graph which corresponds to the Petri net shown in figure 2 (the initial state is i).
