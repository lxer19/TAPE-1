Reference-contexts: Some attempts at cylinder-individual control have also been made [11]. There is yet another line of development in the area of adaptive air-fuel ratio control <ref> [21, 20, 1, 13, 12] </ref>. At first, a constant gain extended Kalman filter was developed and implemented on a single-cylinder research engine [13, 12]. The control scheme included an integrator that could be reset to speed up the slow integration in the feedback loop. <p> The control scheme included an integrator that could be reset to speed up the slow integration in the feedback loop. Feedback control relied on the UEGO sensor. Next, the linear sensor was replaced by a series production sensor by embedding a nonlinear model of the sensor in the observer <ref> [1] </ref>. The idea of integral control via bias estimation was given up, and the integral action was separated from the observer structure. This work was extended to the case of a multi-cylinder engine by incorporating further adaptive features in the feedforward part of the control scheme [21, 20].

Particularly the dynamic behaviour of fuel deposits in the intake system has been a much studied problem. In [44], for example, perturbations to the fuel injection time are correlated with the torque response to identify a model with two parameters. A more sophisticated model is proposed in [52].

Most of the software tools that were used in robust control design are available from the -Analysis and Synthesis Toolbox <ref> [5] </ref>, which could serve as a more practical introduction to robust control. 3.1 Fundamentals 3.1.1 State-Space Systems In this thesis, we always deal with systems in state-space form. <p> Linear fractional transformations can be applied to constant matrices, dynamic systems, or, more generally, to matrices that are varying with time or frequency, see the data formats of the -Analysis and Synthesis Toolbox <ref> [5] </ref> for more details. In addition to feedback interconnections of systems, many systems themselves admit representations via linear fractional transformations, for example, multi-dimensional polynomial or rational functions, state-space realisations of parameter-dependent or uncertain systems, etc.

Reference-contexts: A number of observer-based control configurations have been applied to the problem of air-fuel ratio control. In all cases, the air charge in the cylinder is estimated, either in terms of manifold pressure and engine speed [35] or in terms of volumetric efficiency 10 Introduction <ref> [53, 6] </ref>. In the simplest case, the fuel injection time is calculated by evaluating an inverted model of the process of fuel injection [11, 30, 27]. <p> Generally, experimental results are demonstrated in fixed operating points for constant engine speed. The importance of the delays inherent in the system is emphasised in [27]. Moreover, it is claimed in <ref> [6, 26] </ref> that with the approach described therein a dynamic compensation for the fuel injection is not necessary under warm operating conditions for the most part of the operating envelope, if only the estimates are corrected for the delay in the timing of the fuel injection. <p> these parameters are fixed, so we use a simple phenomenological model, cf. [2]: " m F cyl = # " m F inj : (2.30) The parameter can be related to a combined diffusive and convective process [50], but in practice the model parameters are obtained from system identification experiments <ref> [6, 11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Typically, they also rely on a wide-range UEGO sensor. In this thesis, the problem of transient air-fuel ratio control is treated as a disturbance rejection problem. As a consequence, an electronic throttle is not necessary. Initially, engine models for control system design were developed in continuous time <ref> [40, 14, 39] </ref>. Still they were all mean value models which described the engine behaviour in terms of characteristic values over an engine cycle [28].

Reference-contexts: An even simpler way was found in recent years to replace a number of PI controllers with a single nonlinear controller <ref> [15] </ref>. In sliding mode control the control problem is formulated in terms of a sliding manifold, which is designed to give global Lyapunov stability. However, in order to determine the control calculations, it is necessary to differentiate the stability condition and to solve for the control inputs by dynamic inversion.

Reference-contexts: Typically, mean value engine models may be accurate to within 2 or 3% in steady state, but the accuracy in dynamics may only be 10% <ref> [29] </ref>. With such demanding requirements for control it is in any case questionable, whether state-of-the-art engine models are sufficiently accurate for the task. In the design process, the closed-loop behaviour was also sensitive to the order reduction of the feedforward controller, and special care was taken to eliminate such effects.

Reference-contexts: The classical approach to air-fuel ratio control was to design simple PI controllers in fixed operating points and to schedule the controller gains across the operating envelope <ref> [36] </ref>. For the analysis of the closed-loop behaviour in the frequency domain, the nonlinear characteristic of the EGO sensor was represented by a describing function. <p> If engines were operated in steady state only, such a control scheme would be completely sufficient. In order to increase the bandwidth of the control system, the use of a Smith predictor was suggested in <ref> [36] </ref> to compensate the delays inherent in the engine operation. An even simpler way was found in recent years to replace a number of PI controllers with a single nonlinear controller [15]. <p> As a matter of fact, the calibration effort is reduced 8 Introduction Figure 1.4: Electronic Engine Con trol 1.3 Background 9 significantly with this approach, but several assumptions in the derivation of the controller are very critical. Just as in the case of <ref> [36] </ref>, there is no great potential for transient control with feedback only. Yet another alternative with the same scope are neural nets [37, 49].
