Abstract: The development of any design support system (DSS) is complex. It depends on the task being supported and the organization that is going to use it including its present design practices. This paper describes the initial steps in developing a DSS for marine propeller design based on the process carried out at HSVA (Hamburg Ship Model Basin). We follow a structured approach for this development. We outline the approach in detail and describe the execution of its first steps. We emphasize the need to carefully structure the design task into simpler subtasks and map them initially to computational tasks and only subsequently to implementated modules. The initial mapping has been missing from previous reports on DSSs for propeller design. We identify some of these computational tasks, present a high level view of the DSS' architecture, and discuss our approach to implement it.

Reference-contexts: The motivation was to investigate the possibility of improving the propeller design process by incorporating expertise accumulated over many years of experience in a DSS. We adapt an approach to building DSS previously used for bridge design (Reich <ref> [1] </ref>). The new method consists of four steps, Fig.1, where each step gradually introduces more structure into the problem until appropriate computational support methods are identified for subsequent implementation: Reich 2 1.

Reference-contexts: Improved response time. Improved reliability since once computer tools are built, they always perform the same. A decision support system must be developed carefully to ensure that the underlying assumptions (e.g., propeller charts) and their accuracy is maintained within the support system (Subrahmanian et al. <ref> [2] </ref>). This will allow designers to make correct thoughtful choices and thus use the system effectively. PREVIOUS WORK ON PROPELLER DESIGN KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS Haimov et al. [3], Petrov et al. [4] described the development of a propeller design knowledge-based system (KBS) at the Bulgarian Ship Hydrodynamic Centre (BSHC).

They arrived at a detailed six-stage process that includes the preliminary and detailed design, analysis, manufacturing, test, and documentation. Haimov et al. <ref> [3] </ref> further elaborated this task analysis by specifying the attributes that describe a propeller and the activities related to it. Both papers continued to describe a prototype architecture for a propeller design KBS integrated with a database and analyses tools. The prototype system was named PrKBS (Propeller Knowledge-based System).

Reference-contexts: Certainly, there are differences in the heuristics employed and the models and actual test data available to these experts. Moreover, our approach tries to carry out the development process systematically, while justifying the methods and tools we select. More recently Dai et al. <ref> [5] </ref>, Dai and Hambric [6] incorporated propeller-design knowledge of the David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) in a combined artificial intelligence/numerical optimization shell. The system called PADS (propeller automated design system) employed KBS technology for representing heuristic preliminary design knowledge and genetic algorithms (GA) for the detailed optimization.

Reference-contexts: This is taken as a semi-elliptical distribution. The computation yields then the optimal radial distribution of the circulation. These results are directly used for a 3-d lifting-surface program. The lifting-surface code was developed at MIT by Kerwin and Lee <ref> [7] </ref>, and yields as output the radial distribution of profile camber and pitch. This whole step is rather straight-forward `number-crunching' involving little human intervention. Opportunities for incorporating AI methods: None.

Reference-contexts: A preliminary study on the subject by Neocleous and Schizas <ref> [8] </ref> is being replicated and extended by us. The second task is critical for selecting the best stock propeller. A selection is influenced by previous experience, constraints, and general heuristic knowledge. Case-based reasoning (CBR) (Kolodner [9]), or some other traditional selection method can be used to perform this task.

Fig.3 shows the control loop of the two reasoning methods. Rule-base reasoning is the more familiar but CBR is not more complex. Building it involves coding previous experiences and organizing them with indices.
