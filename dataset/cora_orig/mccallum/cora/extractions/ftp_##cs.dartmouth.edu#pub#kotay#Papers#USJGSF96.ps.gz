Abstract: We wish to navigate across complicated three-dimensional metal web structures. We describe a robot that can propel itself on surfaces oriented around arbitrary directions in three-space. This robot is an inchworm-like robot and its design is simple, modular, and flexible. We present a description of the robot architecture, describe our experimental results, and discuss our research agenda.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we describe the inchworm robot we have built and discuss our results and future plans. 2 Previous Work Our work draws on previous experiences with navigation algorithms [Lat91], designing biologically-inspired robots, and designing minimalist robot systems [DJR96]. Related work on climbing robots include <ref> [Nis92, HNT91, CdP89] </ref>. Nishi [Nis92] describes a biped walking robot that uses a suction device for attachment and is capable of linear motions and surface transitions.

Reference-contexts: However, our robot requires a ferrous surface while the robots proposed in [Nis92, HNT91] use suction cups and thus do not have this dependency. Related work on the mechanical analysis of inchworm robots and climbing robots includes <ref> [FS96, KM94, CG91] </ref>. 3 The Inchworm Architecture The inchworm robot is a light linear structure made of four links. Three joints connect adjacent links providing three degrees of freedom. These joints allow the inchworm to extend and flex. The end links are the robot's two feet (see Figure 1).
