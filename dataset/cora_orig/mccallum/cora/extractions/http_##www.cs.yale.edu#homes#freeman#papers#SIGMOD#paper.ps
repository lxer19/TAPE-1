Title: Lifestreams: A Storage Model for Personal Data

Abstract: Conventional software systems, such as those based on the "desktop metaphor," are ill-equipped to manage the electronic information and events of the typical computer user. We introduce a new metaphor, Lifestreams, for dynamically organizing a user's personal workspace. Lifestreams uses a simple organizational metaphor, a time-ordered stream of documents, as an underlying storage system. Stream filters are used to organize, monitor and summarize information for the user. Combined, they provide a system that subsumes many separate desktop applications. This paper describes the Lifestreams model and our prototype system.

Reference-contexts: Substreams are related to a "views" in relational databases [5]. "Triggers" are related to future documents in Lifestreams (in Lifestreams, the trigger occurs when the creation date of the document slides into the past). There are also connections between Lifestreams and temporal databases [18], temporal logic <ref> [1] </ref>, and sequence database systems [16] where time and/or logical sequences play a crucial role in the system. Our most immediate gain potential from database work is in efficient handling of large document collections.

Reference-contexts: The three portions of the stream, past, present, and future, mirror information categorization in user studies [12], <ref> [2] </ref>. The "present" portion of the stream holds "working documents;" this is also typically where new documents are created and where incoming documents are placed.

Reference-contexts: Our current implementation only provides a single-threaded server (and thus a single point of access). While we've found server performance reasonable for a small number of users, clearly a multi-server and multi-threaded approach present a more scalable architecture. Our previous work in parallel computing has explored these areas <ref> [3] </ref>, but there is work still to be done in the integration of these techniques with basic information retrieval and database functionality.

Reference-contexts: Like a diary, a stream documents work, correspondence and transactions. 2 Although historical context can be crucial in an organiza-tional setting <ref> [4] </ref>, most current systems do little to track when, where, and why documents are created and deleted. The three portions of the stream, past, present, and future, mirror information categorization in user studies [12], [2].

Reference-contexts: Lifestreams also has much in common with database systems. Substreams are related to a "views" in relational databases <ref> [5] </ref>. "Triggers" are related to future documents in Lifestreams (in Lifestreams, the trigger occurs when the creation date of the document slides into the past).

Reference-contexts: Users are forced either to use location on their graphical desktops as reminding cues or to use add-on applications such as calendar managers. We have argued that the former is a mere coping strategy (for lack of a better method) <ref> [6] </ref>, while the latter could clearly be improved if operating systems helped. 6. Personal data should be accessible anywhere and compatibility should be automatic. Computers will eventually be used not as independent data storage devices, but as "viewports" to data stored and maintained on the Net.

Finally, Lifestreams always displays the time in the upper right hand corner of the interface.

Reference-contexts: We were able to solve both of these problems with Lifestreams. We developed a system similar to "warm lists" <ref> [11] </ref>, whereby a daemon watches each user's bookmark file, and each time a new bookmark is added the same bookmark is added to Lifestreams as a new "URL document." The effect of opening a URL document in Lifestreams is that our web browser comes to the foreground and attempts to connect

Reference-contexts: we use substreams to organize documents, why bother with the underlying time-based ordering? For several reasons: time is a natural guide to experience; it is the attribute that comes closest to a universal skeleton-key for stored experience (Malone, for example, suggests the utility of time-based organization in his early studies <ref> [13] </ref>.) The stream adds historical context to a document collection; all documents eventually become read-only (in the past, set in stone for history), and the stream preserves the order and method of their creation.
