Affiliation: German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH)  
Abstract: This paper describes ongoing work on the evaluation of the NLP components of the core engine of smes (Saarbrucker Message Extraction System), which consists of a tokenizer, an efficient and robust German morphology, a part-of-speech (POS) tagger, a shallow parsing module, a linguistic knowledge base and an output construction component. Currently the morphology, the tagger and a parsing module (NP grammar) are under evaluation, at distinct degrees of progress. We present the methodology used and the results obtained so far.

Reference-contexts: The testing of distinct parameterization of the tagger is on the way <ref> (Becker, 1998) </ref>. First results on the basis of small-scale experiments are very promising and a considerable improvement of the performance can be expected. But reliable results can be presented only after a large-scale experiment covering the whole reference corpus has been carried out.

Reference-contexts: In this context we are also evaluating the use of an adapted version of the unsupervised Brill tagger <ref> (Brill, 1995) </ref> for German to support the semiautomatic POS tagging of reference corpora. 3. Evaluation design In a former project the COSMA (Cooperative Schedule 1 See http://www.dfki.de/lt/projects/paradime-e.html. <p> The output of MORPHIX++ consists of a list of all possible readings, where each reading is uniformely represented as a triple of the form &lt;STEM,INFLECTION,POS&gt;. The Brill Tagger Ambiguous readings delivered by MOR PHIX++ are disambiguated wrt. POS using an adapted version of Brill's unsupervised tagger <ref> (Brill 1995) </ref> for German, which is fully integrated in the system architecture of smes 6 . The integrated BRILL tagger consists of a learning component and an application component. Within smes the learning material for the tagger consists of the lexical mark-up of texts provided by MORPHIX++.

Reference-contexts: The design of the lexicon allows for structured extensions. So for example, information about sub-categorization frames extracted from the Sardic lexical data base <ref> (see Buchholz, 1996) </ref> developed at the DFKI has been recently integrated into the verb lexicon. The system now has 11998 verbs with a total of 30042 subcategorization frames at its disposal. The output construction component An output construction component is using fragment combination patterns to define linguistically head-modifier constructions.

Reference-contexts: Information is available under http://dylan.ucd.ie/DiET/. 5 MORPHIX++ is based on MORPHIX <ref> (Finkler and Neumann, 1988) </ref>. 6 First experiments done with the Brill's unsupervised tagger within smes were very promising and Neumann et al. (1997) reported already a tagging accuracy as high as 91.4%. those rules are applied to the morphologically analysed input texts.

Reference-contexts: For this we will adapt another evaluation strategy and go there for a blind scientific asses-ment of system output, under black box conditions, looking for some synergy with the research work done on evaluation of IE systems within the MUC initiative <ref> (sse Grishman and Sundheim 1996) </ref>. 8.

The evaluation study of smes as the analysis component of this application <ref> (see Klein et al., 1997) </ref> revealed important findings which influenced the evaluation design of the components of smes for the PARADIME project: Setting The evaluation of the final linguistic output of smes made it difficult to identify and localize the system's internal deficiencies.

Reference-contexts: We are trying to make the morpho-syntactically annotated reference corpus reusable for other projects and we defined amongst others a mapping to the Stuttgart-Tubingen Tag-Set (STTS), which is widely acknowledged in the German speaking Computational Linguistics community <ref> (see Thielen and Schiller, 1996) </ref>. The validated part of the corpus is currently being tagged with structural information, including agreement. We started with the nominal phrases, considering both the phrasal level and the internal structure in terms of head-modifier relations.
