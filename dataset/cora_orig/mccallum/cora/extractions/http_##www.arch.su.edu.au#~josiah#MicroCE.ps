Abstract: Most computer-based design tools assume designers work with a well defined problem. However, this assumption has been challenged by current research. The explorative aspect of design, especially during conceptual design, is not fully addressed. This paper introduces a model for problem-design exploration, and how this model can be implemented using the genetic algorithm (GA) paradigm. The basic GA, which does not support our exploration model, evaluates individuals from a population of design solutions with an unchanged fitness function. This approach to evaluation implements search with a prefixed goal. Modifications to the basic GA are required to support exploration. Two approaches to implement a coevolving GA are presented and discussed in this paper: one in which the fitness function is represented within the genotype, and a second in which the fitness function is modelled as a separately evolving population of genotypes.

Specifically, CoGA1 is considered for the representation of adapting design prototypes (Alem and Maher, 1994); the representation of the "best optimum" beam design <ref> (Gero, Louis and Kundu, 1994) </ref>; and landscape design in the CYCLOPS program (Navinchandra, 1991).

Reference-contexts: In fact mutation plays a secondary role in the operation of GAs because the frequency of mutation to obtain good results in empirical GAs studies is on the order of one mutation per thousand bit transfers <ref> (Goldberg 1989) </ref>. Mutation has the potential to make small changes to a design concept, rather than a crossover process that makes large changes. We do not employ mutation in our co - evolutionary model of design.

Reference-contexts: The application of GAs to design include the solution to the truss design problem. The ten - 5 member truss problem <ref> (Goldberg and Samtani, 1986) </ref> aims to find the optimal weight of each member for a given predetermined configuration, such that the whole structure is stable and has a minimum weight. The configuration and the fitness function remains unchanged throughout the GA process.

Reference-contexts: This application of a genetic algorithm shows how the representation of the genotype determines the level at which the search occurs, in this case the search included a search for a configuration. However, the goal as defined by the fitness function remains to be the minimum weight configuration. SAGA <ref> (Harvey, 1992) </ref>, Species Adaptation Genetic Algorithms, allows the genotype to change in length as well as content so that species can emerge. He suggests that the notion of a search space is a metaphor when the question of "Where in this whole search space is the optimum?" is asked.

Reference-contexts: Evolutionary systems provide a mechanism for modelling change, however, they assume the goal is fixed. Allowing the goals to change over time, as well as the solution space, can be modelled as a co - evolutionary system. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) <ref> (Holland, 1962) </ref> provide an alternative to traditional search techniques by adapting mechanisms found in genetics. <p> A CoEvolutionary Process for Explorative Design Artificial evolutionary systems have been developed by John Holland <ref> (Holland 1962) </ref> whose goals have been twofold : 1. to abstract and explain the adaptive processes of natural systems and 2. to design artificial software systems that retain the important mechanisms of natural systems.

Reference-contexts: Is a solution that satisfies more criteria necessarily better than a solution that satisfies fewer but all relevant criteria? One approach to allow solutions that satisfy fewer criteria to be selected is to use a modified roulette <ref> (Michalewics, 1992) </ref> to determine the selected individuals. In a modified roulette, the number of criteria used to evaluate the solution could be used in the first round of selections, followed by a selection based on the fitness value of the solution.

The problem domain is landscape design. A hypothetical scenario is used for the design process. The scenario allows new designs to be explored by relaxing constraints and by making tradeoffs among objectives. New criteria can sometimes emerge.

Reference-contexts: The use of an evolutionary system in which the genotypes represent alternative problem definitions and alternative solutions provides the basis for the coevolution of problem space and solution space. 1.1 Exploration in Design Since design has been categorised as a problem solving activity <ref> (Simon, 1969) </ref>, design is treated as a search of the solution space for a result. This idea has dominated the direction of artificial intelligence in design for some time. However, the validity of this hypothesis has been queried by recent work. <p> Another definition of "exploration" is offered by Gero (1993) that: ".. Exploration in design can be characterised as a process which creates new design state spaces or modifies existing design state spaces..." This definition extends the "state space" concept of search <ref> (Simon, 1969) </ref>, so that the state space is changed during exploration. This definition implies that the solutions in the given or predefined state space are insufficient for exploration. Gero continues to suggest that ".. exploration precedes search and it, effectively, converts one formulation of the design problem into another ..
