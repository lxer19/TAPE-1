Abstract: We analyze the deformation of an isotropic, homogeneous circular membrane due to a uniform static pressure applied to one side. The solution is obtained as a perturbation expansion in terms of the pressure. In our analysis the stress is approximated by taking only terms linear in the Euler strain, and thus the analysis applies only to deformations that have small strain. It does include nonlinear geometric effects since the strain is a nonlinear function of the deformation gradient. This theory does not include bending effects, which is reasonable in most paper and film applications.

Reference-contexts: Other researchers have analyzed the deformation of paper by one of two methods. Early work assumed the shape of the deformed surface was a spherical cap <ref> [1] </ref>, [9], and [12]. This shape was used because it simplified the analysis and seemed reasonable based on previous work [3]. Recently, Suhling [10] has found that the shape of the deformation associated with this geometry is not spherical, but more nearly parabolic.

Reference-contexts: The sole limitations of this analysis are that bending effects are negligible and the strains are small.

These are the equations for the first significant terms we obtain in section 4. Analytical methods for obtaining the solution as a power series were presented by Henky [8] and analyzed by Dickey [4].

Reference-contexts: Comparison with Experiments. In this section we apply the results of the analysis to compare with experimental results. For the first comparison we use the data obtained in tests conducted by the U.S. Navy on the deflection of steel plates <ref> [5] </ref>. We compare our results with experiments using steel disks of radius 10 inches and either one-eighth or one-sixteenth of an inch thick. <p> Also, the tests show that the steel was essentially isotropic for small deformations, but was orthotropic for plastic deformations. There are several qualitative agreements that can be made immediately. Several of the figures in <ref> [5] </ref> show that the pressure is proportional to the cube of the center deflection. Selected values that show good agreement are given in Table 3, showing the results for special treatment steel (STS). <p> For higher pressures, the center deflection was larger than that predicted by this analysis, reflecting either the limited validity of the approximation from the perturbation analysis, the plastic behavior of the material, or both. It is also reported in <ref> [5] </ref> that the strain at several points on the disk is proportional to the square of the center deflection (Fig. 31 of [5]). <p> It is also reported in <ref> [5] </ref> that the strain at several points on the disk is proportional to the square of the center deflection (Fig. 31 of [5]).

In this section we address the determination of the stress tensor T as a function of the deformation gradient F; and material properties. By invariance to the observer, see <ref> [6] </ref>, T has the form T = F ~ T F T where ~ T is some tensor function of F T F: We also have that T vanishes when F T F = I; i.e., there is no stress when there is no deformation. <p> higher order terms, we have ~ T = ~ T 1 (E) + O (kEk 2 ) where ~ T 1 () is a linear mapping of the material strain tensor E to the stress tensor ~ T : Since ~ T 1 is linear, by invariance of observer, see <ref> [6] </ref>, ~ T 1 must have the form ~ T 1 = 2E + tr (E)I (3:1) where and are the Lame constants for the two-dimensional surface.
