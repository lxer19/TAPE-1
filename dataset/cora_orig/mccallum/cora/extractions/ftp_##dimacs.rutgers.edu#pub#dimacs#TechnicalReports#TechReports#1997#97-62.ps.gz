Reference-contexts: Since f is continuous we may (by taking subsequences n times) select a sequence w (1); w (2); : : : of weight vectors so that f (w (t)) ! x and each w (t) i tends to a limit u i in the compact interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> as t ! 1. Let B (for "big") be the set of nodes i for which u i = 1 and S := fi : u i = 0g. <p> In statistical mechanics T r is sometimes called the r-branching "Cayley tree" or "Bethe lattice". Baxter <ref> [1] </ref> makes a subtle distinction between the Cayley tree and the Bethe lattice, by declaring that statistical properties of the latter are to be determined by averaging only over those sites in a finite r-ary tree which are far from the leaves.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the hard-core lattice gas model studied e.g. by Dobrushin [5] and Van den Berg and Steif <ref> [2] </ref> strictly forbids configurations in which adjacent sites are both occupied. <p> Thus Hom (G; H) is essentially the set of independent subsets of the graph G. This constraint graph is precisely the one in effect for the hard-core lattice gas model of <ref> [2] </ref>. We shall be studying probability distributions on Hom (G; H). When G is finite there is a very useful and natural class of such measures, sometimes called "multiplicative" measures, defined as follows by positive reals attached to the nodes of H. <p> The hard constraint is that particles may not be too close together; in the model of Dobrushin [5] and Van den Berg and Steif <ref> [2] </ref>, this takes the form of forbidding occupation of two neighboring sites (typically in a cubical grid). Thus, from the graph-theoretic point of view, a configuration is legal iff its occupied sites are an independent set of the lattice.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the hard-core lattice gas model studied e.g. by Dobrushin [5] and Van den Berg and Steif [2] strictly forbids configurations in which adjacent sites are both occupied. Our framework generalizes the gas model above, as well as the symmetric nearest-neighbor systems of Burton and Steif <ref> [4] </ref>, but is still a very special case within the general study of Gibbs measures introduced by Dobrushin [5] and Lanford and Ruelle [10].

Reference-contexts: In the classical (ferromagnetic) Ising model, adjacent particles are discouraged from having opposing spins, since such opposition increases the energy of a configuration, making it a less likely state; this is a "soft" constraint. In contrast, the hard-core lattice gas model studied e.g. by Dobrushin <ref> [5] </ref> and Van den Berg and Steif [2] strictly forbids configurations in which adjacent sites are both occupied. <p> Our framework generalizes the gas model above, as well as the symmetric nearest-neighbor systems of Burton and Steif [4], but is still a very special case within the general study of Gibbs measures introduced by Dobrushin <ref> [5] </ref> and Lanford and Ruelle [10]. <p> Note that even the measure which is concentrated at a single instance of such a 2-neighbor coloring is a Gibbs measure. Gibbs measures do exist for any G, H and , and indeed in far more general circum stances. Following is a theorem of Dobrushin <ref> [5] </ref>, specialized to our framework. We give a proof here, as it is quite easy, and the ideas and notation employed therein will be useful later. <p> The hard constraint is that particles may not be too close together; in the model of Dobrushin <ref> [5] </ref> and Van den Berg and Steif [2], this takes the form of forbidding occupation of two neighboring sites (typically in a cubical grid). Thus, from the graph-theoretic point of view, a configuration is legal iff its occupied sites are an independent set of the lattice.

Reference-contexts: If x 2 S were not in the range of g t , then the map obtained by composing g t with projection from x to @S would be a retraction of S to @S, contradicting Brouwer's Fixed-Point Theorem (see, for instance, Dugundji <ref> [6] </ref>, Chapter XVI.2). Thus each g t is a surjection. Now, given any 2 ^ S, and any sequence t k tending to 0, choose points w (k) 2 ^ S such that g t k (w (k) ) = .

Reference-contexts: Here the connection between Gibbs measures and branching random walks facilitates analysis, and indeed quantitative analysis of the Ising model and various generalizations has been made on the Bethe lattice (see e.g. <ref> [14, 8, 7] </ref>). When G is a regular tree, for any H and any set of activities on the nodes of H, certain well-behaved measures on the space of homomorphisms from G to H correspond precisely to branching, or "tree-indexed", random walks on H.

Our interest in this special case stems only partly from a desire to explore the notion of hard constraint; we also aspire to combine techniques from graph theory and combinatorics with the traditional methods of statistical mechanics, with the object of obtaining some relatively tangible phase transitions.

Reference-contexts: We will make use of the following lemma, which is a straightforward consequence of the multi-dimensional Mean Value Theorem (see, for instance, <ref> [11] </ref>, Theorem 12.2). Lemma 7.3 Let E be an open convex set in IR n , and let : E ! IR m be a function whose components 1 ; : : : ; m are differentiable on E.

Reference-contexts: The general problem of determining whether there is more than one Gibbs measure for a given set of "specifications" is a central problem of statistical mechanics, often called the DLR problem after Dobrushin, Lanford and Ruelle (see e.g. <ref> [12] </ref>). The term "phase transition" is often associated with the existence of multiple Gibbs measures, so that a statistical physicist might say that the subject of this article is phase transitions for hard-constraint systems on the Bethe lattice. There is no universal agreement about the exact meaning of phase transition.

Reference-contexts: Let A = fa ij g be the adjacency matrix of H, and let B = fb ij g where b ij := i a ij . It follows from the Perron-Frobenius Theorem (see, e.g., <ref> [13] </ref>) that B has a positive left eigenvector w which is unique up to a constant multiple; say w B = cw. But then, for any node i of H, w i = (w A) i i w i = c so w is a valid set of weights.
