Abstract: Data warehouses and OLAP engines are expected to be widely available in the near future. The data in data warehouses has been cleansed, integrated, and preprocessed, and infrastructures have been built surrounding data warehouses for efficient data analysis. Therefore, data warehouses or OLAP databases are expected to be a major platform for data mining in the future. We discuss the issues related to efficient and effective data mining in large data warehouses and/or data marts, including the desired architectures for an integrated on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and on-line analytical mining (OLAM) system, the expected features of OLAM, and how to implement such a system effectively.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction With recent developments of data warehouse and OLAP technology <ref> [5] </ref>, it is expected that a tremendous amount of data will be integrated, preprocessed, and stored in large data warehouses. Currently, most of the data warehouses are being used for summarization-based, multi-dimensional, on-line analytical processing.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, highly modularized design and standard APIs will be important for systematic development of OLAM systems and for developing, testing, and sharing data mining modules across multiple platforms and systems. For example, OLEDB for OLAP [18] and MDAPI <ref> [7] </ref>, by Microsoft and OLAP Council respectively, could be important initiatives towards standardization of data warehouse APIs not only for OLAP but also for mining in data cubes. It is also interesting to develop sharable visualization tool packages, especially some Java-based, platform independent knowledge visualization tools. 2.

High quality of data in data warehouses. Most data mining tools need to work on integrated, consistent, and cleaned data, which requires costly data cleaning, data transformation, and data integration as preprocessing steps <ref> [8] </ref>. A data warehouse constructed by such preprocessing serves as a valuable source of high quality of data for OLAP as well as for data mining. Notice that data mining may also serve as a valuable tool for data cleaning and data integration as well [8]. 2. <p> data integration as preprocessing steps <ref> [8] </ref>.

Comprehensive information processing and data analysis infrastructures have been or will be systematically constructed surrounding data warehouses, which include accessing, integration, consolidation, and transformation of multiple, heterogeneous databases, ODBC/OLEDB connections, Web-accessing and service facilities, reporting and OLAP analysis tools, etc. <p> There have been many studies on cube-based data mining including concept description [12], classification [16], association [15], prediction [6], clustering [2], etc. Cube-based mining may inherit the spirit of relational or transactional data mining methods, such as <ref> [3, 8] </ref>, but may explore many distinct features of cube-based multidimensional optimization.

Reference-contexts: Among many different paradigms and architectures of data mining systems, On-Line Analytical Mining (OLAM) (also called OLAP mining), which integrates on-line analytical processing (OLAP) with data mining and mining knowledge in multi-dimensional databases, is a promising direction <ref> [9] </ref> for the following reasons. fl Research was supported in part by a research grant and a CRD grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, a grant NCE:IRIS/Precarn from the Networks of Centres of Excellence of Canada, and grants from B.C.

We have been studying and implementing OLAM mechanisms in the DBMiner system <ref> [10] </ref>. Many expected features and methods discussed in this paper are being added incrementally and tested in the system.

Reference-contexts: It is prudent to make the best use of the available infrastructures rather than constructing everything from scratch. 3. OLAP-based exploratory data analysis. Effective data mining needs exploratory data analysis <ref> [14] </ref>. A user will often want to traverse through a database, select portions of relevant data, analyze them at different granularities, and present knowledge/results in different forms.

Reference-contexts: mining, a technique has been developed to first collect the candidates which "potentially" pass the minimum support threshold by certain rough spatial evaluation, such as using minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs), and only those which pass the rough test will be further examined using a more expensive spatial computa tion algorithm <ref> [17] </ref>. 5. Layer-shared mining with data cubes. Since each dimension of a data cube represents an organized layer of concepts, data mining can be performing by first examining the high levels of abstraction and then progressively deepening the mining process towards lower levels of abstraction.

Reference-contexts: This requires mining not only be performed with a limited scope of data, confined by queries and/or constraints, but also adopt efficient, constraint-based data mining algorithms. For example, many constraints involving set containments and/or aggregate functions can be pushed deeply into the association rule mining process <ref> [19] </ref>. Such constraint-based mining should be explored in many other data mining tasks. 4. Progressive refinement of data mining quality. There is a wide spectrum of data mining algorithms: some are fast and scalable but may not be of as high quality as some relatively expensive ones.
