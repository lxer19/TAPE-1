Title: A Physically Based Mesh Generation Algorithm: Applications in Computational Medicine

Abstract: The process of generating a finite element mesh is accelerated by integrating physical and geometrical constraints into the initial mesh. By beginning with a near-optimal initial mesh, fewer iterations of refinement are needed to obtain mesh convergence. We apply this algorithm to large-scale bioelectric field problems involving the complex geometries of the human body.

Reference-contexts: Introduction One class of important applications in computational medicine is volume conductor problems which arise in electrocardiography and electroencephalography. To solve such problems, one first discretizes the physical geometry into elements, and then applies a finite element (FE) analysis to approximate the bioelectric fields throughout the discretized geometry <ref> [1] </ref>. Next, an error analysis is performed to find elements which need refinement. Additional elements are introduced and the process continues in an iterative fashion until some a priori convergence criteria is reached.

Reference-contexts: Effectively, it must be composed of small patches in the areas of high gradient and maintain the integrity of all boundaries. To generate a grid with these properties, we "morph" or interpolate between the shapes of internal source boundaries and external insulating boundaries <ref> [2] </ref>. Morphing provides the geometric characteristics of the mesh, and the rate of the morph controls the density of the mesh. The intermediate interpolated shapes are resampled in space and "time" to provide the actual mesh points.

Reference-contexts: The intermediate interpolated shapes are resampled in space and "time" to provide the actual mesh points. For models with simple topologies, this method produces results similar to mapping methods for grid generation <ref> [3] </ref>. However, as we will demonstrate, the morphing method handles domains with complex topologies more gracefully. Methods As an initial testbed, we have constructed an algorithm to generate meshes from segmented MR images.

Reference-contexts: A curve in two-dimensional space may be represented in several different ways. These representations can be divided into three classes: parametric, explicit, and implicit <ref> [4] </ref>. For this application, we will exploit the properties of the implicit representation in order to perform shape interpolation.
