Title: Random Field Ising Model  
Author: Markus Dittrich 
Date: May 15, 1998  
Abstract: This paper gives an introduction to the Random Field Ising Model (RFIM). Since its first discussion in the paper by Imry and Ma [1] there has been great interest in this model, since Ising or Ising-like systems in random fields are a good representation of a large number of impure materials. These show features that can not be understood by studying ideal systems (i.e. Ising model). There are a lot of interesting topics related to the RFIM e.g. the stability of the ferromagnetic phase and lower critical dimension d l , interface properties, order of the phase transition, scaling laws, renormalisation group treatment and crossover phenomena. We will then more specifically discuss the 3d RFIM that is currently under strong investigation, in particular the problem of characterizing the phase transition. Since diluted antiferromagnets are a convenient probe for studying random fields in an experimentally controlable way (and have been shown to belong to the same static critical behaviour universality class) they will be discussed in some detail. Experimental data will be presented to compare with the theoretical predictions made.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Before I start discussing the RFIM I would like to warn the reader right at the beginning, especially if he plans to go deeper into the subject. The RFIM has first been proposed about twenty years ago by Imry and Ma <ref> [1] </ref> and up to the present day, even though a lot of progress has been made, many of its features are either not yet understood or there are different opinions about what the actual physical properties are. <p> As mentioned above, the RFIM was first discussed in 1975 in a paper by Imry and Ma <ref> [1] </ref> and is currently under strong theoretical and experimental investigation. The experimental progress in the RFIM, however, came not before it was recognized that dilute antiferromagnets in homogeneous fields are ideal experimental probes to study these systems. We will discuss this in a later section. <p> In the rest of the paper I try to work out what is new about the RFIM, i.e. what properties are different from those of the well known pure Ising model. 2 Stability of ferromagnetic phase This important topic was first addressed in <ref> [1] </ref>. We know that the Ising model with Hamiltonian given by equation 1 and H = 0 exhibits long range order for d &gt; 1, or in other words it has a lower critical dimension d l = 1.

Reference-contexts: One can see that the ZFC peaks exhibit symmetric logarithmic behaviour over a range of jtj that increases with the applied field. The logarithmic divergence in the RF case implies ff = 0. Figure 5 shows recent data (from <ref> [9] </ref>) for the specific heat, taken for Fe 0:93 Zn 0:07 F 2 . In the right part of figure 5 the phonon contribution has 15 already been subtracted. The inset shows the FC data that is much more rounded due to frozen in finite size metastable clusters.

Reference-contexts: In the case d = 2, it is not a priori obvious, but it has been shown <ref> [10] </ref> that there exists an instability for d = 2 due to the roughness of the domain wall surface (see next section) so that there is no long range order in two dimensions. The lower critical dimension therefore changes to d l = 2.

Reference-contexts: There might be stronger instabilties that we will neglect in the following. In addition, there are other complications that we have not taken into account in our considerations, e.g. * domains within domains ! it can be shown that they are rare for d &gt; 2 <ref> [14] </ref> * there generally exist a large number of different contours for a domain of size R ! it can be shown that they all basically include the same volume and random fields and that with probability one there is no contour enclosing a random field gain that is larger than

Reference-contexts: No mechanism was known for easily generating fields in a controlled way that coupled to the order parameter with uncorrelated randomness on the scale of the crystal lattice spacing. This changed in 1979 when Fishman and Aharony <ref> [16] </ref> proposed a physical realisation of such a mechanism. They showed that an external uniform field applied to an anisotropic antiferromagnet with random exchange coupling will generate random fields coupling to the antiferromagnetic order parameter (staggered magnetisation).

Reference-contexts: Using equation 15 we obtain the following relation for our exponent - This has in fact already been proven for a number of random field systems by Schwartz and Soffer <ref> [17] </ref>. We see that there is a drastic change in the scaling behavior due to random fields. We know that in the pure system there are only two independent exponents which are related through the scaling laws.
