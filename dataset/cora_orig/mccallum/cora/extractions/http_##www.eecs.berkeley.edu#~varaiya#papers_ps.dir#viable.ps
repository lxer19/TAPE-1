Abstract: Hybrid systems are continuous variable, continuous time systems with a phased operation. Within each phase the system evolves continuously according to the dynamical law of that phase; when an event occurs, the system makes a transition from one phase to the next. In this paper, we study hybrid systems with nondeterministic discrete and continuous behaviors. We use nondeterministic finite automata to model the discrete behavior and state dependent differential inclusions to model the continuous behavior. By viability we mean the system's ability to take an infinite number of discrete transitions. Viability can be used to express safety and fairness properties over the system's state trajectories. To ensure viability, the system's evolution must be restricted so that discrete transitions occur within specific subsets of their enabling conditions. Following Aubin [3], we call these subsets the system's viability kernel. We give results pertaining to certain continuity properties of the viability kernel, we give conditions under which the viability kernel can be computed in a finite number of steps, and we synthesize a hybrid controller that yields all viable trajectories.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the viable control theory described by us is an approach to synthesize controllers that yield close to optimal behavior in a robust manner. 2 The Hybrid Automaton Model The hybrid automaton model given below is a generalization of the models recently introduced in literature (see Alur et. al. <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, and Puri et. al. [10]). A hybrid transition system is a tuple H = (Q; R ; ; E; ): Q is the finite set of discrete states and R n is the set of continuous states. is the finite set of discrete events. <p> Example 2. Consider a hybrid system consisting of a single discrete state q and a single self-loop edge e. This is shown in Figure 3. The continuous state space is R. The dynamics in q are given as _x = 0. X e = <ref> [1; 1] </ref> and r e (x) = 2x. Then, N k (X H ) = [ 1 2 k ] and X fl = f0g. Thus, 8k (N k (X H ) 6= X fl ). 2 Fig. 3. N k (X H ) 6= X fl for any k. <p> Thus, the condition of Lemma 7 is sufficient but not necessary. Example 3. Consider the hybrid system H shown in Figure 4. Then Fig. 4. A sample hybrid system. X H = (<ref> [1; 1] </ref>; [1; 1]) T ; 1 ; 2 X fl = N (X H ): 6 To see this, endow the space E fi E fi with the topology of pointwise convergence with the discrete topology on E. By Tychonoff's Theorem [7], this space is compact since E is finite.

Reference-contexts: In section 5 we define the 0-lag nonblocking control strategy. In section 6 we give the hybrid controller synthesis and the conditions under which it yields this strategy.

In the latter setting, a system is said to be viable if its state remains in a specified subset, called the viability set, of the state space|i.e., the viability set must remain invariant under the system dynamics. <p> First we introduce some notation.
