Abstract: Two approaches have been used to balance the cost of generating effective tests for ICs and the need to increase the ICs' quality level. The first approach favors using high-level fault models to reduce test generation costs at the expense of test quality, and the second approach favors the use of low-level, technology-specific fault models to increase defect coverage but lead to unacceptably high test generation costs. In this report we (1) present the results of simulations of complete single stuck-at test sets against a low-level model of bridge defects showing that an unacceptably high percentage of such defects are not detected by the complete stuck-at test sets; (2) show how low-level bridge fault models can be incorporated into high-level test generation; and (3) describe our system for generating effective tests for bridge faults and report on its performance.

Reference-contexts: That is, the resistive model of the transistors predict an output voltage always being between 2 and 3 Volts when the bridged nodes are being driven to different logic values. Possible solutions are to employ IDDQ testing <ref> [Ack83] </ref>, apply more accurate circuit simulation of faults, detect the bridge as a delay fault, or redesign the cells so that a discrepancy is guaranteed for at least one input combination for each cell.

Reference-contexts: Note that the transistor strength model used in the COSMOS fault simulator cannot model this fault correctly by assigning any combination of strengths to the eight transistors. Bridger uses the resistive model for conducting transistors that was suggested by Acken <ref> [Ack88] </ref> and later by Storey [SM90].

Reference-contexts: In addition to providing the weighted fault list, this version of Carafe provides a gate level netlist for Nemesis and a list of fault types to Bridger. To evaluate Carafe's performance we ran it on the ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits collected by Brglez and Fujiwara <ref> [BF85] </ref>. The standard-cell layouts we used for the circuits were provided by MCNC. This version of Carafe's performance at extracting the realistic bridging faults of the MCNC cells on a Sparcstation 1+ is shown in Table 3.1.

Reference-contexts: Test pattern generation time and the number of untestable faults is much less using IDDQ testing but this has to be traded off with the fact that the application of test vectors for IDDQ testing is slower than for logic level testing <ref> [Cra87] </ref>. We also plan on integrating the testing for breaks on the interconnection lines, and the testing for defects within the cells to Carafe and Nemesis.

Reference-contexts: If the yield is 75%, the test set must detect 99.93% of the defects. Recent evidence shows that many defects are not detected by test sets that detect all single stuck-at faults (hereafter called complete SSF test sets) in some circuits <ref> [FS88, SM90, PRM90] </ref>. The studies reported by Ferguson and Shen, and Storey and Maly consisted of defect simulations to determine which circuit-level defects were probable, followed by a fault simulation to find the defect coverage [FS88, SM90]. <p> The studies reported by Ferguson and Shen, and Storey and Maly consisted of defect simulations to determine which circuit-level defects were probable, followed by a fault simulation to find the defect coverage <ref> [FS88, SM90] </ref>. The study by Pancholy, et al., involved fabricating easily diagnosable integrated circuits, testing them with a diagnostic test set, and applying a complete SSF test set to the faulty ICs. <p> Such a defect in the physical layer could be caused by a particle of dust on the metal mask or in the photoresist used to shape the metal layer. For a more complete description of the determination of realistic faults see <ref> [FS88] </ref>. Carafe finds which bridges are possible by considering the range of probable spot defect sizes for each layer being considered and finding all nodes that are within that distance or closer to each other in that layer.

Reference-contexts: The logic function caused by the bridge faults was obtained using a Spice simulation. The figure shows that two PMOS transistors in parallel are stronger than the NMOS transistors in series for NAND gates in the CMOS3 standard cell library <ref> [Hei88] </ref>, but a single PMOS transistor is not. Note that the transistor strength model used in the COSMOS fault simulator cannot model this fault correctly by assigning any combination of strengths to the eight transistors.

Reference-contexts: The program that performs this task is Nemesis. The interfaces between these programs are shown in Figure 3.1. 3.1 Carafe A version of Carafe (Circuit and ReAlistic Fault Extractor) is used to find the probable bridge faults between signal lines in the circuit <ref> [Jee90] </ref>. Carafe determines which bridge faults are possible by simulating the results of spot defects on the physical layout of the circuit. Defects are modeled as changes in the electrical behavior of small spots on the physical layers of the IC.

Reference-contexts: Second, it applies a Boolean satisfiability algorithm to find a solution to the resulting formula. Any solution for the formula is a test that detects the fault <ref> [Lar92] </ref>. In order to generate tests for bridge faults, three routines were added to Nemesis and three routines were modified in Nemesis.

Reference-contexts: McCluskey and Buelow have shown a simple relationship between the defect coverage of a test set, the yield of the manufacturing process, and the quality level of the circuits that passed the test set assuming that defects are independently distributed on the chip <ref> [MB88] </ref>. Table 3 from McCluskey and Buelow's paper shows that to obtain the relatively modest quality level of 200 DPM in a circuit with a 90% yield requires that the test set detect 99.8% of the manufacturing defects.

Reference-contexts: The remainder of this report is concerned with the detection of bridge faults between signal lines connecting the standard cells only. Bridges in the interconnect layers are much more common than breaks in the interconnect layers for many fabrication processes <ref> [MTCC87] </ref>.

A System for Detecting Realistic Bridge Faults Test structures can be used to estimate the defect density of many types of spot defects on the IC <ref> [MTCC87] </ref>. Carafe uses this knowledge to estimate the probability that if a bridge fault occurs, how likely it is. One of Carafe's inputs is a file that describes the defect density and the distribution of defect sizes for each layer.
