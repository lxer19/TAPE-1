Title: Face Recognition Under Varying Pose

Abstract: Researchers in computer vision and pattern recognition have worked on automatic techniques for recognizing human faces for the last 20 years. While some systems, especially template-based ones, have been quite successful on expressionless, frontal views of faces with controlled lighting, not much work has taken face recognizers beyond these narrow imaging conditions. Our goal is to build a face recognizer that works under varying pose, the difficult part of which is to handle face rotations in depth. Building on successful template-based systems, our basic approach is to represent faces with templates from multiple model views that cover different poses from the viewing sphere. To recognize a novel view, the recog-nizer locates the eyes and nose features, uses these locations to geometrically register the input with model views, and then uses correlation on model templates to find the best match in the data base of people. Our system has achieved a recognition rate of 98% on a data base of 62 people containing 10 testing and 15 modeling views per person.

Reference-contexts: Pictorial approaches, representing faces by using filtered images of model faces, include template-based systems ([2], [6], [13], [7], and [5]), systems using principal components analysis to derive a pictorial "face space" ([15], [20], <ref> [1] </ref>, [9]), and connectionist approaches ([16], [11], [10], [21], and [12]). [18] explores an interesting hybrid representation that combines the geometrical and pictorial approaches, representing faces as elastic graphs of local textural features. <p> As example invariant representations, filtering the face image with a bandpass filter like the Laplacian provides some invariance to lighting, and shift invariance can be provided by using the Fourier transform magni-tude <ref> [1] </ref> or autocorrelation [17]. The face can be normalized for translation, scale, and image-plane rotation by finding at least two facial features usually the eyes in existing systems and using these features to register model and input representations.

Reference-contexts: The second part of the geometrical alignment step attempts to compensate for any small remaining geometrical differences due to rotation, scale, or expression. A dense set of pixelwise correspondence between the affine transformed input and the model is computed using optical flow <ref> [3] </ref>. Given this dense set of correspondences, the affine transformed input can be brought into pixel-level correspondence with the model by applying a 2D warp operation driven by the optical flow.

Reference-contexts: A branch at any level in the search tree is pruned if the template correlation values are not above a level-dependent threshold. Space limitations in these proceedings prevent a more detailed presentation; for details, see <ref> [4] </ref>. To evaluate the feature finder, the system was run on all 1550 images in the data base, the 15 modeling and 10 testing images of each of the 62 people. <p> Since our current implementation of the pose estimator can only distinguish between looking left and looking right (see <ref> [4] </ref>), the poses selected by the recognizer for comparison are either the left three columns or right three columns of figure 1. In the future a more refined pose estimate will allow the recognizer to further winnow down the number of model poses it needs to test for each person.

Reference-contexts: There are two main approaches to input representation, a geometrical approach that uses the spatial configuration of facial features, and a pictorial approach that uses an image-based representation. Feature-based systems ([14], [9], <ref> [6] </ref>, and [8]) locate a set of facial features (e.g. corners of the eyes and mouth, sides of the face and nose, nostrils) and then capture the spatial configuration in feature vector whose dimensions typically include measurements like distances, angles, and curvatures. <p> Pictorial approaches, representing faces by using filtered images of model faces, include template-based systems ([2], <ref> [6] </ref>, [13], [7], and [5]), systems using principal components analysis to derive a pictorial "face space" ([15], [20], [1], [9]), and connectionist approaches ([16], [11], [10], [21], and [12]). [18] explores an interesting hybrid representation that combines the geometrical and pictorial approaches, representing faces as elastic graphs of local textural features. <p> What distinguishes our approach from these techniques will be a wider allowed variation in viewpoint. Overall, while face recognition systems have been successful (the template-based systems in [2] and <ref> [6] </ref> achieved 100% recognition on a data base of over 40 people), most recognition systems work with frontal views, no expressions, and controlled lighting. Our goal is to build a face recognizer that works under varying pose, the difficult part of which is to handle face rotations in depth. <p> Using fewer exemplars decreases the running time but also reduces system flexibility and recognition performance. 4 Face recognition using multiple views As mentioned in the introduction, template-based face recognizers have been quite successful on frontal views of the face ([2], <ref> [6] </ref>). Our goal is to extend template-based systems to handle varying pose, notably facial rotations in depth. Our approach is view-based, representing faces with templates from many images that cover the viewing sphere. <p> Best performance was had from dx+dy, mag, and lap, with dx+dy yielding the best recognition rate at 98.7%. Preprocessing with the gradient magnitude performs nearly as well, a result in agreement with the preprocessing experiments of <ref> [6] </ref>. Given that the original grey levels lead to the lower rate of 94.5%, our results indicate that preprocessing the image with a differential operator gives the system a performance advantage. <p> The intermediate scale performs the best, a result in agreement with Brunelli and Poggio <ref> [6] </ref>. For preprocessing, separate correlations on the x and y components of the gradient were computed and then summed (dx+dy). In a related line of research, we plan to address the problem of recognizing a person's face under varying pose when only one view of the person is available.

Reference-contexts: The key new component will be an example-based learning system that uses many images of prototype faces undergoing changes in pose to "learn" what it means to rotate a face (see <ref> [19] </ref>). The system will apply this knowledge to synthesize new "virtual" views of the person's face. Overall, we have demonstrated in this paper that template-based face recognition systems can be extended in a straightforward way to handle the problem of varying pose.
