Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) <ref> [1] </ref> is a promising technique to utilize the enormous bandwidth of the optical fiber. Multiple wavelength-division multiplexed channels can be operated in a single fiber simultaneously; however, a fundamental requirement in fiber-optic communication is that these channels operate at different wavelengths.

The use of wavelength to route data is referred to as wavelength routing, and a network which employs this technique is known as a wavelength-routed network <ref> [2] </ref>. Such a network consists of wavelength-routing switches (or routing nodes) which are interconnected by optical fibers. Some routing nodes (referred to as cross-connects) are attached to access stations where data from several end-users could be multiplexed on to a single WDM channel.

In order to transfer data from one access station to another, a connection needs to be set up at the optical layer similar to the case in a circuit-switched telephone network.

A continuous wave (CW) signal at the desired output wavelength ( c ) is modulated by the gain variation so that it carries the same information as the original input signal. <p> The input signal and the CW signal can be launched either co- or counterdirectional into the SOA. The XGM scheme gives a wavelength-converted signal that is inverted compared to the input signal.

All-optical wavelength conversion: In this method, the optical signal is allowed to remain in the optical domain throughout the conversion process.

Reference-contexts: A possible architecture of such a wavelength-convertible switching node is 7 the dedicated wavelength convertible switch (see Fig. 9, from <ref> [24] </ref>). In this architecture, each wavelength along each output link in a switch has a dedicated wavelength converter, i.e., an M fi M switch in an N -wavelength system requires M fi N converters. <p> However, the dedicated wavelength-convertible switch is not very cost-efficient since all of the wavelength converters may not be required all the time [25]. An effective method to cut costs is to share the converters. Two architectures have been proposed for switches sharing converters <ref> [24] </ref>. <p> When opto-electronic wavelength conversion is used, the functionality of the wavelength converter can be performed at the access stations instead of at the switches. The share-with-local switch architecture proposed in <ref> [24] </ref> (see Fig. 11) and the simplified network access station architecture proposed in [26] (see Fig. 12) fall under this category. 3 Network Design, Control and Management Issues 3.1 Network Design Network designs must evolve to incorporate wavelength conversion effectively. <p> Designs of switch architectures have been proposed (see Section 2.2) which allow sharing of converters among the various signals at a switch. It has been shown in <ref> [24] </ref> that the performance of such a network saturates when the number of converters at a switch increases beyond a certain threshold. An interesting problem is to quantify the dependence of this threshold on the routing algorithm used and the blocking probability desired. 3. <p> This is the wavelength-continuity constraint described in Section 1. This routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem, or variants of it, has been studied earlier [32, 33, 34] for networks without wavelength conversion. Dynamic routing algorithms have been proposed for use in a wavelength-convertible network <ref> [24, 35] </ref>. Algorithms have also been studied which use a fixed path or deterministic routing [36]. In such a scheme, there is a fixed path between every source-destination pair in the network. <p> deliver almost all of the performance improvement offered by an ideal full-range converter. 4.2.4 "Minimal" wavelength conversion in WDM rings [45] In addition to reducing the overall blocking probability, wavelength converters can improve the fairness performance by allowing many long-distance lightpaths, which would have been blocked otherwise, to be established <ref> [24] </ref>. In this paper [45], the authors define the Unfairness 20 Factor as the ratio of the average blocking on the longest path to the blocking on the shortest path.

However, the dedicated wavelength-convertible switch is not very cost-efficient since all of the wavelength converters may not be required all the time <ref> [25] </ref>. An effective method to cut costs is to share the converters. Two architectures have been proposed for switches sharing converters [24]. <p> An interesting question which has not been answered thoroughly is where (optimally?) to place these few converters in an arbitrary network and what is the likely upgrade-path towards full-fledged convertibility? A heuristic technique for the placement of these sparse converters in an all-optical network is presented in <ref> [25] </ref>. 2. Sharing of converters: Even among the switches capable of wavelength conversion, it may not be cost-effective to equip all the output ports of a switch with this capability.

However, to make the analysis of the network without wavelength conversion tractable, the approach in <ref> [40] </ref> makes an approximation by assuming Poisson arrivals at the links in this case also. The network blocking probabilities can be obtained by solving the set of coupled nonlinear equations called Erlang's map. <p> An analytical model for evaluating the path blocking performance of such networks is also presented and is shown to be accurate for a variety of network topologies. The model improves on the one in <ref> [40] </ref> by relaxing the independence assumptions on the loads and wavelength occupancy probabilities of the links.
