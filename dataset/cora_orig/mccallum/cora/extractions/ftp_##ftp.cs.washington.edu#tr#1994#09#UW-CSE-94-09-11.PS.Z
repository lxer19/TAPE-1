Reference-contexts: Although wavelets have their roots in approximation theory [6] and signal processing [15], they have recently been applied to many problems in computer graphics. These graphics applications include image editing <ref> [1] </ref> and compression [7], automatic level-of-detail control for editing and rendering curves and surfaces [9, 11, 14], surface reconstruction from contours [16], and fast methods for solving simulation problems in global illumination [3, 12, 19] and animation [13]. <p> + c 2 1 (x) + c 2 2 (x) + c 2 3 (x): A more graphical representation is I (x) = 8 fi + 1 fi Note that the coefficients c 2 0 ; : : : ; c 2 3 are just the four original pixel values <ref> [8; 4; 1; 3] </ref>. <p> For i = 0; : : : ; k, and for r = 1; : : :; d, let 3 N 0 ( 0 otherwise N r x x i N r1 x i+r+1 x N r1 The endpoint-interpolating B-splines of degree d on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> result when the first and last d + 1 knots are set to 0 and 1, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Each of these is a generalization to two dimensions of the one-dimensional wavelet transform described in Section 2.1. Note that a multidimensional wavelet transform is frequently referred to in the literature as a wavelet decomposition. To obtain the standard decomposition <ref> [2] </ref> of an image, we first apply the one-dimensional wavelet transform to each row of pixel values. This operation gives us an average value along with detail coefficients for each row. <p> The standard decomposition of an image gives coefficients for a basis formed by the standard construction <ref> [2] </ref> of a two-dimensional basis. Similarly, the non-standard decomposition gives coefficients for the non-standard construction of basis functions. The standard construction of a two-dimensional wavelet basis consists of all possible tensor products of one-dimensional basis functions.

Finkelstein and Salesin [9] have developed a collection of wavelets for the cubic case, and Chui and Quak <ref> [5] </ref> present constructions for 22 arbitrary degree. Although the derivations for arbitrary degree are too involved to present here, in Appendix B we give the synthesis filters for the piecewise-constant (Haar), linear, quadratic, and cubic cases. <p> The rich theory of B-splines can be used to develop expressions for the entries of the refinement matrix P j (see Chui and Quak <ref> [5] </ref> for details). The columns of P j are sparse, reflecting the fact that the B-spline basis functions are locally supported. The first and last d columns of P j are relatively complicated, but the remaining (interior) columns are shifted versions of column d+1. <p> The basic idea is to construct Q j+1 a column at a time. The matrices in Appendix B reveal a simple structure for the locations of non-zero entries; the values are determined by solving the linear system of constraints implied by Equation (11). Chui and Quak <ref> [5] </ref> use a slightly different characterization based on derivative and interpolation properties of B-splines. 5.4 B-spline filter bank At this point, we have completed the steps in designing a multiresolution analysis.

Reference-contexts: Regardless of whether the function of interest is an image, a curve, or a surface, wavelets provide an elegant technique for representing the levels of detail present. Although wavelets have their roots in approximation theory <ref> [6] </ref> and signal processing [15], they have recently been applied to many problems in computer graphics. <p> Wavelets that are both locally supported and orthonormal (other than Haar wavelets) were thought to be impossible until Daubechies' ground-breaking work showing that certain families of spaces V j actually do admit orthonormal wavelets of small support <ref> [6] </ref>. 5 Spline wavelets Until now, the only specific wavelet basis we have considered is the Haar basis.

The approach presented here is only introductory; for a more complete treatment of wavelet image compression, see the article by DeVore et al. <ref> [7] </ref>. 3.1 Compression The goal of compression is to express an initial set of data using some smaller set of data, either with or without a loss of information. <p> One could also imagine running a more sophisticated constrained optimization procedure whose goal is to select the minimum number of coefficients subject to the error bound. DeVore et al. <ref> [7] </ref> suggest that the L 1 norm is best suited to the task of image compression. Rather than repeat their results, we refer the interested reader to their article.

We could, for example, require the columns of Q j+1 to be sparse, and further require a minimal number of consecutive non-zeros. This approach is taken by Finkelstein and Salesin <ref> [9] </ref> in their construction of cubic spline wavelets. This same approach was used to construct the wavelets summarized in Appendix B. The basic idea is to construct Q j+1 a column at a time. <p> The resulting banded system can be solved in linear time using LU decomposition [17]. 6 Application II: Multiresolution curves and surfaces Our second application of wavelets in computer graphics is that of curve design and editing, as described in detail by Finkelstein and Salesin <ref> [9] </ref>. Their multiresolution curves are built from a wavelet basis for endpoint-interpolating cubic B-splines, which we discussed in the previous section.

Reference-contexts: [h j1 j j1 i] = 0: (4) Substituting Equation (2) into Equation (4) yields [h j1 j j i] Q j = 0: (5) The columns of Q j must therefore form a basis for the null space of [h j1 j j i] (see Golub and Van Loan <ref> [10] </ref> for a discussion of null spaces). There are a multitude of bases for the null space of a matrix, implying that there are many different wavelet bases for a given space W j .

The original formulation of multiresolution analysis is applicable to functions defined on the infinite real line. Following Lounsbery et al. <ref> [14] </ref>, we generalize the theory to functions defined on a bounded interval by making use of block matrices instead of convolution filters. Section 5 introduces smooth wavelets based on bounded-interval B-splines. <p> For example, in at different levels of detail. (a) (b) (c) (d) scale (d). Multiresolution analysis can be further generalized to surfaces of arbitrary topology by defining wavelets on subdivision surfaces, as described by Lounsbery et al. <ref> [14] </ref>. This method allows any polyhedral object to be decomposed into scaling function and wavelet coefficients. Then a compression scheme similar to that presented for images in Section 3 can be used to display the object at various levels of detail simply by leaving out small wavelet coefficients.
