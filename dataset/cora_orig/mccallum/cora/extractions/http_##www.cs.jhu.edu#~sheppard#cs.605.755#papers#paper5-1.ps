Date: 3.1 Introduction  
Abstract: Evolutionary Algorithms are often presented as general purpose search methods. Yet, we also know that no search method is better than another over all possible problems and that in fact there is often a good deal of problem specific information involved in the choice of problem representation and search operators. In this paper we explore some very general properties of representations as they relate to neighborhood search methods. In particular, we looked at the expected number of local optima under a neighborhood search operator when averaged overall possible representations. The number of local optima under a neighborhood search operator for standard Binary and standard binary reflected Gray codes is developed and explored as one measure of problem complexity. We also relate number of local optima to another metric, , designed to provide one measure of complexity with respect to a simple genetic algorithm. Choosing a good representation is a vital component of solving any search problem. However, choosing a good representation for a problem is as difficult as choosing a good search algorithm for a problem. Wolpert and Macready's (1995) No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem proves that no search algorithm is better than any other over all possible discrete functions. Radcliffe and Surry (1995) extend these notions to also cover the idea that all representations are equivalent when their behavior is considered on average over all possible functions. To understand these results, we first outline some of the simple assumptions behind this theorem. First, assume the optimization problem is discrete; this describes all combinatorial optimization problems-and really all optimization problems being solved on computers since computers have finite precision. Second, we ignore the fact that we can resample points in the space. The "No Free Lunch" result can be stated as follows:

Reference-contexts: Empirically, Gray coding usually results in better performance than using a standard Binary coding when applying various forms of genetic algorithms and neighborhood search algorithm using common test functions (Caruana and Schaffer, 1988; Mathias and Whitley, 1994a; 1994b). It has long been known that Gray coding removes Hamming cliffs <ref> (Caruana and Schaffer, 1988) </ref>. A Hamming cliff corresponds to a pair of numbers in numeric/integer space whose bit representations are complementary. Thus in a four bit space, 7 and 8 are adjacent in numeric space but their representations as bit strings are 0111 and 1000.

Reference-contexts: But it is easy to prove that for all represenations of functions in F defined over L bits, Gray always induces fewer minima that Binary over the set of functions with a single optimum <ref> (for a proof, see Whitley and Rana, 1997) </ref>. For problems with encodings up to 6 bits we can also prove that Binary induces fewer minima over worst-case problems when compared against Gray. By worst-case, we mean problems that have N/2 minima in a search space of N points.
