Title: The Online Transportation Problem  
Author: Bala Kalyanasundaram Kirk R. Pruhs 
Note: O(1)-competitive under this assumption.  
Abstract: We study the online transportation problem under the assumption that the adversary has only half as many servers at each site as the online algorithm. We show that the greedy algorithm is fi(min(m; log C))- competitive under this assumption, where m is the number of server sites, and C is the total number of servers. We then present an algorithm Balance, which is a simple modification of the greedy algorithm, that is
