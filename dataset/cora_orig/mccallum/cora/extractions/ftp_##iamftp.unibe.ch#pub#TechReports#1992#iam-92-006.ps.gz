Abstract: In this paper we present a novel technique for rapidly partitioning surfaces in range images into planar patches. Essential for our segmentation method is the observation that, in a scan line, the points belonging to a planar surface form a straight line segment. On the other hand, all points on a straight line segment surely belong to the same planar surface. Based on this observation, we first divide each scan line into straight line segments and subsequently consider only the set of line segments of all scan lines as segmentation primitives. We have developed a simple link-based data structure to efficiently represent line segments and their neighborhood relationship. The principle of our segmentation method is region growing. Three neighboring line segments satisfying an optimality criterion are selected as a seed region, and then a growing is carried out around the seed region. We use a noise variance estimation to automatically set some thresholds so that the algorithm can adapt to the noise conditions of different range images. The proposed algorithm has been tested on real range images acquired by two different range sensors. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is fast and robust.

Reference-contexts: From this discussion, we define the optimality measure of a seed region candidate as 1 [ i6=j jm i jjm j j X n i n j ] + 0:5 (13) which falls into the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. In summary, we compute for each seed region candidate the optimality measure defined in (13), and select the candidate with the largest optimality value as the seed region for the growing process. Here some comments on Pavlidis' algorithm [22] are adequate. <p> As a matter of fact, we have not paid special attention to efficiency in our current implementation. The Median filter and the splitting algorithm for line segment extraction, for instance, were directly implemented. The Median filtering could be done more efficiently <ref> [1, 19] </ref>. We could also use the faster pseudo-Median filter [24]. Moveover, there are more efficient ways for the iterative splitting [5, 9, 10]. Thus, our implementation could be further speeded up.

Reference-contexts: The development of advanced computer vision systems involves improvements in both data acquisition technology and algorithmic approaches. One advance in data acquisition is the development of direct and effective indirect range imaging techniques <ref> [2, 13, 18] </ref>. Raw range images in their full dimensionality, however, are just a list of numbers, and can not directly support high-level scene interpretation processes without some type of perceptional organization. One way of perceptional organization is the segmentation of range images into surface patches.

Reference-contexts: Roughly speaking, the segmentation algorithms known in the literature can be classified into general and dedicated approaches. In a general approach, only general knowledge about surfaces is used to compute a complete segmentation and reconstruction. The algorithm proposed by Besl <ref> [3] </ref>, for instance, assumes only that the range data may be interpreted as noisy samples of a piecewise-smooth surface. On the contrary, dedicated approaches search for particular structures in range data, such as planes, cylinders, cones or solids of revolution.

We could also use the faster pseudo-Median filter [24]. Moveover, there are more efficient ways for the iterative splitting <ref> [5, 9, 10] </ref>. Thus, our implementation could be further speeded up. A closer look at Table 1 reveals that a large portion (65% or even more) of the run time is devoted to the Median filtering and the computation of RMSE. The actual segmentation takes merely a few seconds.

Reference-contexts: For a synthetic 128 fi 128 cube image, a segmentation time of about 2 minutes has been reported on a HP9000 computer. Among the numerous clustering algorithms, the adaptive distance dynamic clusters algorithm (ADDC) <ref> [6] </ref> is of particular interest to the problem of partitioning range images into planar regions. ADDC is a "crisp" (hard) clustering algorithm specially designed to search for clusters that lie in subspaces (such as lines or (hyper)planes) of the original feature space.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that the simple splitting method of Duda and Hart produces sometimes superfluous line segments. Pavlidis and Horowitz [21] tried to solve this problem by introducing a merge step. As stated in <ref> [7] </ref>, however, this algorithm is computationally much more expensive. For complex curves, it produces sometimes worse results than the simple splitting method.

Reference-contexts: We use the classical splitting algorithm proposed by Duda and Hart <ref> [8] </ref>. It splits a curve into two parts at the point most distant from the chord between the two end-points of the curve whenever this maximal distance is greater than some preset threshold. The algorithm proceeds recursively until the curve can not be divided further.

Reference-contexts: Real range images suffer from sensor noise. Before the actual segmentation takes place, it would be advantageous 6 to reduce the noise level of an image while preserving edge information. The Median filter turned out to be a good candidate for this purpose <ref> [11] </ref>. Thus, we use the Median filter on a 3 fi 3 neighborhood as a standard preprocessing step. The first step of the algorithm is the partition of each scan line into straight line segments.

Reference-contexts: If this is planar, then it is used as a seed to grow to the boundary of the planar region. In [20], the split-and-merge paradigm by Horowitz and Pavlidis <ref> [12] </ref> has been extended from greylevel to range imagery. The approach in [28] is an enhanced version of the split-and-merge technique. It differs from the approach in [20] in a number of ways. <p> Examples are the methods described in <ref> [12, 20, 28] </ref>. As a drawback, the quadtree structure often results in some false region boundaries. In [25], the authors used another data structure of a more geometric nature, namely the Delaunay triangulation defined by a set of triangles tessellating the image domain.

Reference-contexts: In any clustering algorithm, two important aspects have to be considered, namely the feature space in which the clustering takes place, and a strategy for partitioning the feature space into clusters without a priori information about the actual number of clusters. In <ref> [14] </ref>, the authors define the feature vector of a pixel (x; y) to be the parameters of the facet model z = fi 0 +fi 1 x+fi 2 y +fi 3 x 2 +fi 4 xy + fi 5 y 2 in a small local (2L + 1) fi (2L + <p> Even with this reduced data dimension, a segmentation time of 70 (ADDC) and 600 (FADDC) seconds has been reported on a Sun Sparcstation. Despite the computational expense, the (F)ADDC algorithm 3 has some advantages over other clustering algorithms, such as that in <ref> [14] </ref>. As the clustering in (F)ADDC proceeds in the original image space, there is no need for the computation of feature vectors from the range image. Since no feature vectors need to be extracted, discontinuity poses no problem, and the resulting segmentation is very sharp.

Reference-contexts: If we define the feature space to be the range image itself, then the clusters found by ADDC correspond to planar regions. In <ref> [15] </ref>, ADDC has been extended to the fuzzy case (FADDC), and a compatible cluster merging technique has been proposed to find the optimum number of clusters. Unfortunately, this special clustering algorithm is computationally very expensive. It has been tested on two 200 fi 200 range images from ERIM.

Reference-contexts: Since no feature vectors need to be extracted, discontinuity poses no problem, and the resulting segmentation is very sharp. Finally, the mapping from clusters back into the image domain and the subsequent analysis is no more necessary. The approach in <ref> [17] </ref> is quite different from other techniques known in the literature. It is based on the observation that the first-order polynomials which determine the planar surfaces in a range image satisfy the Laplace equation. The segmentation is solved by a relaxation process.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that the simple splitting method of Duda and Hart produces sometimes superfluous line segments. Pavlidis and Horowitz <ref> [21] </ref> tried to solve this problem by introducing a merge step. As stated in [7], however, this algorithm is computationally much more expensive. For complex curves, it produces sometimes worse results than the simple splitting method.

Reference-contexts: Together with a simple optimality measure for seed region extraction and a simple test for growing decisions, the use of line segments makes our algorithm very fast. The idea of scan line grouping is not new. In fact, Pavlidis <ref> [22] </ref> has proposed a similar approach and applied it to the segmentation of images from a scanning electron microscope. <p> This approach, however, requires a good initial guess of the break points. It is also necessary to estimate the number of line segments J , at least for a few of the scan lines. In <ref> [22] </ref>, an estimate of J was obtained through experimental tests on a few scan lines. A subsequent grouping phase merges line segments into larger regions. Two neighboring line segments are merged if the absolute difference between their slopes is smaller than a threshold. <p> It differs from his method in a number of ways. First, we use a much simpler method for partitioning the scan lines into straight line segments. Secondly, we extract optimal seed regions for the growing process. Moreover, the similarity criterion for two line segments used in <ref> [22] </ref> is not feasible and sufficient for our application. Therefore, we will give a modified similarity measure. Finally, we introduce a postprocessing step to get clean edges between regions. This paper is organized as follows. The next section gives an overview of the algorithm. <p> Hence, we use the algorithm of Duda and Hart without any merging. Consequently, 8 our scan line partition method is much simpler than that of Pavlidis <ref> [22] </ref>. However, this simple method does work well as the experimental results in section 7 show. <p> In summary, we compute for each seed region candidate the optimality measure defined in (13), and select the candidate with the largest optimality value as the seed region for the growing process. Here some comments on Pavlidis' algorithm <ref> [22] </ref> are adequate. In his algorithm, two neighboring line segments are merged if the absolute difference between their slopes is smaller than a threshold. As stated above, however, slope is not an appropriate metric for direct comparison. Thus, the simple similarity test of Pavlidis is not feasible for our application.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the investigation of special properties of 1 As a matter of fact, the x-coordinates and the data of the points at the end of the line segments provide the basis for a powerful method of image compression <ref> [23] </ref>. Our interest here, however, lies not in efficient storage and transmission of pictorial information but in an image representation which allows a fast segmentation. 20 line segments enables us to formulate the simple optimality measure in (13) for seed region extraction and the growing criterion in (16).
