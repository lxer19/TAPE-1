Abstract: We are concerned with the complexity of 2mth order elliptic two-point boundary-value problems Lu = f. Previous work on the complexity of these problems has generally assumed that we had partial information about the right-hand side f and complete information about the coefficients of L, often making unrealistic assumptions about the smoothness of the coefficients of L. In this paper, we study problems in which f has r derivatives in the L p -sense and for L having the usual divergence form with a i;j being r i;j -times continuously differentiable. We find that if continuous information is permissible, then the "-complexity is proportional to (1=") 1=(~r+m) , where and show that a finite element method (fem) is optimal. If only standard information (consisting of function and/or derivative evaluations) is available, we find that the complexity is proportional to (1=") 1=r min , where r min = minf r; min and we show that a modified fem (which uses only function evaluations, and not derivatives) is optimal.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we investigate these topics. As usual, we consider elliptic operators L in divergence form Lv = 0i;jm We now assume that each coefficient a i;j being r i;j -times continuously differentiable, and that f has r derivatives in the L p -sense, where p 2 <ref> [2; 1] </ref>. We first consider the case of continuous information. Let ~r = minf r; min 0i;jm Then the following results hold: * The "-complexity is proportional to (1=") 1=(~r+m) . * If k 2m + ~r 1, then a fem of degree k is optimal. <p> j, the coefficient a i;j of the operator L A is bounded in the C r i;j sense, i.e., Roughly speaking, A 2 A if (2.1) is a two-point elliptic boundary value problem, the only novelty being that we require a "uniformity condition." We next let r m, p 2 <ref> [2; 1] </ref>, and M &gt; 0 be given parameters. <p> Choose z 2 C 1 (I) satisfying support z I 0 ; z 0; D (l 1 ) z)(x 1 ) = = D (l ~n ) z)(x ~n ) = 0; I 0 (5.5) where C is independent of n, see, e.g., <ref> [1, pp. 301-304] </ref>. Define the matrix ~ A (z) by (4.11), as in the proof of Theorem 4.1.

Reference-contexts: The operator S is nonlinear. However, S ([f ; A]) depends nonlinearly only on A, i.e., for any fixed A, the operator S ([; A]) is a linear operator. Hence we may use the generalized Lax-Milgram Lemma ([2, pg. 112], <ref> [5, pg. 310] </ref>) to see that for any [f ; A] 2 F , there exists a unique solution u 2 H m 0 (I) to (2.2). Hence, the solution operator S is well-defined. Next, we need to define information for our problem.

Reference-contexts: We close this Introduction by outlining the structure of the rest of this paper. In Section 2, we give a precise definition of the class of problems to be studied. In Section 3 we briefly recall the standard general techniques from <ref> [6] </ref> that will be useful in what follows. In Section 4, we establish our results for continuous information. Finally, in Section 5, we prove the results for standard information. 2. <p> Some general remarks Recall that the goal of this paper is to find the complexity of our class of two-point boundary-value problems, as well as optimal algorithms, for the classes of continuous and standard information. We do this by applying the standard techniques described in, e.g., <ref> [6, Chapter 4] </ref>, which we outline here for convenience. First, we determine a lower bound on the complexity. We do this as follows. For information N , let denote the radius of information, i.e., the minimal error among algorithms using N .

Reference-contexts: Moreover, it is generally assumed that these coefficients are as smooth as necessary; they are often assumed to even be infinitely differentiable. Under these assumptions, the complexity of such problems has long been well-known (see, e.g., <ref> [7, Chapter 5] </ref>). To be specific, suppose that we This research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation under Grant CCR-95-00850. measure error in the energy norm.
