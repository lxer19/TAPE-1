Reference-contexts: Representing curl (vorticity), which is itself a vector field with additional physical meaning, can be achieved by a cylindrical icon with candystriping to indicate both the direction and magnitude of vorticity. 1.5 Quantification In the quest for interrogative visualization <ref> [Baj88] </ref>, in which the user can not only see the data, but navigate and query for increased understanding, the ability to quantify and perform volumetric measurements is vital. Another challenge to visualization is to give quantitative information concerning time dependent studies and time-varying structures (e.g. flow).

Scalar attributes are handled by incorporating them into the energy function.

Errors incurred from local retriangulation are not propagated to the simplified mesh, hence there is no global error control.
