Abstract: We consider a discrete model for asynchronous circuits and show that, under very mild restrictions, this model excludes the existence of glitch-free arbiters. This result contradicts a long standing conjecture that the nonexistence of glitch-free arbiters is due to the continuous nature of such circuits.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We consider a fundamental problem in the theory of asynchronous circuits, namely the construction of arbiter circuits; see, for example, Chaney and Molnar [4], Hurtado and Elliot [6], Marino [8], Lamport [7], Black <ref> [1] </ref>, and Udding [13]. Of particular interest in the design of arbiter circuits is the so-called "glitch" phenomenon: An arbiter circuit may take an arbitrarily long time to adjust the values of its outputs in response to changes in the values of its inputs. <p> Such flip-flops are commonly used in the construction of 4 more elaborate arbiter circuits; for example, see the circuits given in <ref> [1] </ref> and [8]. Theorem 1: There are glitch-prone arbiters. Proof: We show that the R-S flip-flop shown in Figure 1 is a delay-unbounded, unstable arbiter. This circuit is defined by the following set of actions (the actions are labeled for convenience).

Reference-contexts: A history whose first state is the initial state is called an initialized history. 2 Our model of a circuit is discrete. Discrete models of asynchronous circuits date back to the work of Miller [10], and have been used more recently 3 by Martin <ref> [9] </ref> and by Chandy and Misra [3]. A defense of such models is presented later in Section 6.3. <p> The design 15 of a given circuit can then be formally checked by proving that the required specification is satisfied. Such an approach has been used by Martin, for example, to construct verifiably correct VLSI chips <ref> [9] </ref>. Some of the perceived inadequacies of the discrete model can be dismissed. The glitch phenomenon is a case in point.

Reference-contexts: The glitch phenomenon usually manifests itself when the asynchronous inputs of an arbiter change value at approximately the same time, thereby forcing the arbiter to "choose" between two or more assignments to its outputs. It has been shown by Vosbury [14] and by Palais and Lamport <ref> [11] </ref> that the glitch phenomenon is inherent in arbiter circuits. These proofs are based on a continuous model of asynchronous circuits. In fact, Palais and Lamport state that a proof of this result must be based on a continuous model. <p> of circuits, we have shown that the discrete model is adequate in this respect, provided the atomicity of a circuit is carefully defined. 7 Concluding Remarks Palais and Lamport state that a proof of the existence of the glitch phenomenon "must be based upon some continuity assumption" concerning asynchronous circuits <ref> [11] </ref>. We have shown that such a proof can, in fact, be based upon a discrete model of a circuit, provided very mild restrictions are placed on the atomic actions of a circuit. Our results point out the importance of atomicity when defining a discrete model of a circuit. <p> We are also thankful to Jim Burns for suggesting several improvements in the presentation, and for bringing reference [7] to our attention, and to Nick Pippenger for bringing references <ref> [11] </ref> and [14] to our attention.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, if each wire output is the input of at most one gate, then oscillating behavior cannot be prevented. Proofs that are based on the more acceptable continuous models seem to obscure these important points. According to Seitz <ref> [12] </ref>, it is necessary in the design of self-timed circuits to place restrictions on when the value of the input of an action can change; such restrictions are called domain constraints.
