Reference-contexts: We used both generalized-profile search methods and hmm search methods to evaluate each of the models. We constructed two profiles using existing profile-construction methods: Profile-3d and Profile-333. The same construction technique was used for both, but Profile-3d started from a structural alignment of seven globins <ref> [Bashford et al., 1987] </ref>, while Profile-333 started from a multiple alignment of 333 randomly chosen globins that was produced automatically using ClustalW [Thompson et al., 1994a]. The set of sequences included one of the two-domain globins (GLB ASCSU), two of the flavohemoproteins (FHP YEAST and HMPA VIBPA), and five fragments.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the disjointness definition applied by the method for finding multiple best alignments between sequence pairs, this definition includes two adjustable parameters (the ends of the protected region) conferring remarkable flexibility to the motif search method (for a discussion of biological examples, see <ref> [Bucher and Bairoch, 1994] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The 676 sequences include a few unusual sequences, and exclude a few sequences that others may consider globins. Table 3 lists the unusual sequences. In previous studies of this kind (for example, <ref> [Gribskov et al., 1987, Krogh et al., 1994] </ref>), the globin-recognition problem was treated as a sequence classification problem. However, such an approach simplifies the underlying biological problem since globin folding units, like most other protein structural domains, occasionally occur as multiple copies in the same polypeptide chain.

Reference-contexts: The sequences in the alignments were weighted with the method of [Sibbald and Argos, 1990]. The match tables were created with a 10 log 10 - scaled blosum-45 matrix <ref> [Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992] </ref>, and position-specific gap weights were created using parameters recommended in [Luthy et al., 1994]. The initiation and termination scores were set to zero, except for the ones that need to be 1 to get semiglobal alignment (see Table 2).

Reference-contexts: The generic algorithm is relatively slow, requiring recomputation of the entire path matrix for each accepted alignment, but the sequence analysis literature provides many hints how to speed up this process. For example, for the no-common-pair disjointness definition, <ref> [Huang and Miller, 1991] </ref> contains a efficient algorithm not requiring storage of the entire path matrix. A similar time- and space-efficient solution for the prosite disjointness definition has been developed, and will be described in a subsequent paper.

Reference-contexts: If the constraints are not met, the generalized profile can have some rather non-intuitive behavior, preferring incomplete matches to complete ones, to avoid the low external scores. Note that profiles constructed from linear hmms, such as those constructed by SAM <ref> [Hughey and Krogh, 1995] </ref>, will have 1 for all initiation scores except in position 0 and for all termination scores except in position m, because the corresponding edges do not exist (equivalently, have probability zero) in SAM's hmms. <p> The parallel tests performed with the hmm search algorithm have to classify sequences, since the SAM package <ref> [Hughey and Krogh, 1995] </ref> used does not have the ability to report multiple alignments. <p> These sequences have not been counted in choosing the highest scoring non-globin, but are listed in the table as false positives. * SAM does a poorer job in finding fragments than searches using generalized profiles. This difference comes from a difference in alignment modes. The SAM package <ref> [Hughey and Krogh, 1995] </ref> used for linear hmm search supports only the family and domain models introduced by Krogh [Krogh et al., 1994], which represent special cases of the more general model proposed in Section 4 of this article.

Reference-contexts: Generalized profiles are equivalent to a class of hidden Markov models 12 background distribution specified by the insert state N I with a geometric length distribution specified by the probability p 0 . z T <ref> [Milosavljevic and Jurka, 1993] </ref>. Of course, this test relies on using a reasonable null model, which is not always available. Before we can construct an equivalent hidden Markov Model for a generalized profile, we need to know what null model was used for the generalized profile.

Reference-contexts: This section outlines the algorithm used in prosite to generate reasonable sets. The methods for finding alignment sets for motif search are adapted from efficient algorithms for finding multiple best local alignments between two sequences (for a review, see <ref> [Pearson and Miller, 1992] </ref>). The basic algorithm for finding multiple disjoint alignments is an iterative procedure that adds one alignment to the set on each iteration.

Reference-contexts: The same construction technique was used for both, but Profile-3d started from a structural alignment of seven globins [Bashford et al., 1987], while Profile-333 started from a multiple alignment of 333 randomly chosen globins that was produced automatically using ClustalW <ref> [Thompson et al., 1994a] </ref>. The set of sequences included one of the two-domain globins (GLB ASCSU), two of the flavohemoproteins (FHP YEAST and HMPA VIBPA), and five fragments. The multiple alignments were directly converted to generalized profiles using the current method used for constructing prosite profiles.

Reference-contexts: The standard disjointness test used in prosite represents an adaptation of the problem of finding multiple non-intersecting best local alignments between two sequences formulated by <ref> [Waterman and Eggert, 1987] </ref>. The basic idea of disjointness is that the profile matches two separate parts of the sequence independently. The particular disjointness definition used in prosite declares a range of match positions, including intervening insert positions, as a protected region of the profile. <p> 2. remove from the path matrix all edges that are parts of non-disjoint alignments. (See Appendix A for explanation of the path matrix and calculation of optimal alignments.) This algorithm is applicable to variety of disjointness definitions including the standard definition used in prosite and the no-common-pair definition introduced in <ref> [Waterman and Eggert, 1987] </ref>. Implementation of the basic methods is simple, requiring only two modifications to the algorithm used to compute the optimal alignment score.
