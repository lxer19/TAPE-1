Abstract: The algebra isomorphism between M 4 (R) and HH, where H is the algebra of quaternions, has unexpected computational payoff: it helps construct an orthogonal similarity that 2fi2 block-diagonalizes a 4fi4 symmetric matrix. Replacing plane rotations with these more powerful 4 fi 4 rotations leads to a quaternion-Jacobi method in which the `weight' of 4 elements (in a 2 fi 2 block) is transferred all at once onto the diagonal. Quadratic convergence sets in sooner, and the new method requires at least one fewer sweep than plane-Jacobi methods. An analogue of the sorting angle for plane rotations is developed for these 4 fi 4 rotations.

Reference-contexts: What then is the best way to carry out this task? Among the many schemes to be evaluated are several iterative techniques and one direct method due to Bojanczyk and Lutoborski <ref> [2] </ref>, that gives closed form formulae for the eigenvectors of a 3 fi 3 symmetric matrix. A matrix representation of Q can be obtained analogously. However, we shall see in x12 that in practise block diagonalization suffices, so Q need never be computed. 10.

Reference-contexts: The Quaternions. Recently, Derek Hacon <ref> [10] </ref> showed that one can use quaternions to construct an orthogonal similarity transformation which will directly reduce any given 4 fi 4 skew-symmetric matrix to its real Schur (2 fi 2 block diagonal) form, and thereby obtain a Jacobi-type algorithm for n fi n skew-symmetric matrices. <p> The Skew-Symmetric Algorithm. We have everything we need to outline how Hacon's method <ref> [10] </ref> for transforming a 4 fi 4 skew-symmetric matrix K directly into its real Schur form works. By Proposition 3, there exist pure quaternions p; q such that K = p 1 + 1 q. Let R = x y 2 SO (4). <p> Then R KR t = xpx 1 + 1 yqy: By Proposition 4b, all that remains is to find two 3-dimensional rotations: (x x) to rotate the 3-vector p into the i-direction and (y y) to rotate the 3-vector q into the i-direction. Hacon <ref> [10] </ref> shows that taking x = j jpj ip j jqj iq (15) achieves this goal.
