Title: ABSTRACT  
Note: 1.0 Introduction  
Abstract: While numerous power optimization techniques have been proposed at all levels of design pr ocess abstractions for electronic components, until now, power minimization in mixed mechanical-electronic subsystems, such as disks, has not been addressed. We propose a conceptually simple, but realistic power consumption model for disk drives. The core of the paper ar e heuristics for optimization of power consumption in several common har d real-time disk-based design systems. We show how to coor dinate tasks scheduling and their disk data assignment, in or der to minimize power consumption in both electr onic and mechanical components of used disks. Extensive experimental results indicate significant power reduction. Magnetic disks are the de-facto standard for providing nonvolatile high volume memory capacity in modern computer systems. Disks provide superior tradeoff with respect to common design metric such as cost, memory capacity, latency, data input-output bandwidth and reliability in comparison with all other alternatives. Until recently, disks have been used mainly in general purpose computing systems. However, convergence of several application and technological trends resulted in the rapidly increasing importance of massive storage in application specific systems. There is rapid growth in applications such as internet-based servers (e.g. world wide web), video-on-demand, interactive television, and video c o n f e r e n c i n g , a l l o f w h i c h h a v e a s d o m i n a t i n g components large volume data management. At the same time technological trends indicate that key design metrics of modern and future application specific designs, such as speed, power, and weight, are dominated by massive storage elements. Most often, magnetic disk is already a bottleneck in current application specific computer and communication systems. Another equally pronounced consequence of the current application and technological trends is increasing importance of power minimization. Our main strategic objective is to give impetus for research and development of synthesis and compilation techniques for design of massive storage-based application specific systems. We have three main technical goals in this paper: 1. To establish an accurate, but computationally efficient, performance and power consumption mod

The task scheduling and disk assignment problem employs a reiterative heuristic which repeatedly solves the task scheduling problem and the disk assignment problem separately using their TSP and SA heuristics until no improvement is achieved. The heuristic is described using the following pseudo-code: Generate a random disk assignment.
