Title: Applying Case Retrieval Nets to Diagnostic Tasks in Technical Domains  
Author: Mario Lenz Hans-Dieter Burkhard and Sven Bruckner ; 
Keyword: Technical diagnosis, case retrieval, memory structures

Abstract: This paper presents Objectdirected Case Retrieval Nets, a memory model developed for an application of Case-Based Reasoning to the task of technical diagnosis. The key idea is to store cases, i.e. observed symptoms and diagnoses, in a network and to enhance this network with an object model encoding knowledge about the devices in the application domain.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore the extension of the OCRN with rules will be examined. Different types of rules and their integration with the case-based reasoning approach of OCRNs will be considered, e.g. completion-rules (cf. <ref> [2] </ref>), constraints and user-interaction-rules. The third branch which will be followed will be the improvement of the user-interaction. In particular, the use of user-profiles and resource-adaptive systems will be investigated.

Reference-contexts: However, this knowledge does not suffice for a model-based approach and hence we decided to apply CBR enhanced by an object model. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the basic ideas of Case Retrieval Nets while not really going into details about this model (cf. <ref> [5, 9] </ref> for broader investigations). In Section 3 the focus is set on applications in the area of technical diagnosis and an extended model of CRNs especially suitable for this task is introduced.

Reference-contexts: As an alternative memory model we have developed the model of Case Retrieval Nets (CRNs <ref> [9] </ref>), which are particularly suitable for analytic CBR tasks, such as classification, diagnosis, and decision support ([6, 8]). <p> However, this knowledge does not suffice for a model-based approach and hence we decided to apply CBR enhanced by an object model.

These may represent any basic knowledge item, such as a particular attribute-value-pair or an observable symptom.

Reference-contexts: If some stations are found one can compare them to select the nearest. Otherwise, i.e. if there was no station, one will extend the scope (e.g. consider neighboring quadrants, too) until at least one station is contained in it. The method of Lazy Propagation of Similarity as introduced in <ref> [10] </ref> formalizes this idea and allows to further reduce the retrieval effort without loosing completeness 4 .

Reference-contexts: Basically, this means that no case will be discarded during the retrieval process which would have been retrieved, for example, by using a flat search through the case base. For a more formal definition cf. <ref> [14, p.160] </ref> Fig. 2.

Reference-contexts: This has led to a number of sophisticated techniques for this subtask, as for example indexing techniques ([11]); kd-trees ([14, 15]); the "Fish-and-Sink" approach ([12]); the Crash memory model ([3]); and Knowledge-directed Spreading Activation (KDSA, <ref> [16] </ref>). As an alternative memory model we have developed the model of Case Retrieval Nets (CRNs [9]), which are particularly suitable for analytic CBR tasks, such as classification, diagnosis, and decision support ([6, 8]).
