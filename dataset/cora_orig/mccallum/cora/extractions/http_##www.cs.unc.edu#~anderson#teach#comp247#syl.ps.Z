Abstract: Goals of the course: To present fundamental algorithms and impossibility results from the concurrent programming literature, and to cover techniques for formally specifying and verifying concurrent systems. Both message-passing and shared-memory models of concurrency will be considered. At the end of the course, students will have a general knowledge of the concurrent programming literature, and will be able to develop new concurrent algorithms and verify their correctness. Perhaps the most important skill to be developed is the ability to intuitively "see" how or why a concurrent program works (a skill most students probably take for granted when it comes to sequential programs). Prerequisites: Comp 203 (Parallel and Distributed Computing) and Comp 204 (Software Design and Implementation). If you haven't had both prerequisites and would like to take the class anyway, please see me. Students who took Comp 204 in the fall and are currently taking Comp 203 in the spring are welcome to enroll in Comp 247. Take-home assignments will be given approximately once a month. These assignments are required to be individual efforts. In addition, students will be required to investigate a research topic of their choosing in some depth, and to write a research paper or survey paper on that topic. Students will also be required to present a talk on their research topic. You are advised to see me early and often with regard to your choice of a topic (the "good" topics sometimes go fast). Topics related to your research area are especially encouraged. To be eligible for a grade of H, you must regularly participate in class discussions. To this end, you are strongly advised to read papers before they are discussed in class. Text: The primary "text" will be research papers (see list below). Students are required to pay a fee of $20 for copies of papers and class notes. This fee should be paid to my secretary Madelyn Mann (SN318). You must pay this fee in order to receive a final grade in the class. We will also use the following book.
