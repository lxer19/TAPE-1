Abstract: A network of Wilson-Cowan oscillators is constructed, and its emergent properties of synchronization and desynchronization are investigated by both computer simulation and formal analysis. The network is a two-dimensional matrix, where each oscillator is coupled only to its neighbors. We show analytically that a chain of locally coupled oscillators (the piece-wise linear approximation to the Wilson-Cowan oscillator) synchronizes, and present a technique to rapidly entrain finite numbers of oscillators. The coupling strengths change on a fast time scale based on a Hebbian rule. A global separator is introduced which receives input from and sends feedback to each oscillator in the matrix. The global separator is used to desynchronize different oscillator groups. Unlike many other models, the properties of this network emerge from local connections, that preserve spatial relationships among components, and are critical for encoding Gestalt principles of feature grouping. The ability to synchronize and desynchronize oscillator groups within this network offers a promising approach for pattern segmentation and figure/ground segregation based on oscillatory correlation.

Reference-contexts: Each oscillator operates simultaneously with all the others, and computations are based only on connections and oscillations, both of which are particularly feasible for VLSI chip implementation (for an actual chip implementation exploring phase locking see <ref> [3] </ref>). It also provides an elegant representation for real time processing. Given the enormous amount of information processing required by sensory processing, a parallel architecture and the potential for VLSI implementation are both very desirable qualities.

Reference-contexts: But the phase model does not exhibit the rich variety of behaviors that other, more complex nonlinear oscillators, have when locally coupled. For the so called Brusselator, a model of chemical oscillation, stable states can arise or disappear, depending on initial conditions and the coupling strength <ref> [7] </ref>. Moreover, if the ratio of the coupling strengths is explored, period doubling bifurcations and chaos can develop [55]. Neu [49] gives a general result describing synchrony for locally coupled oscillators, but it is obtained by taking a continuum limit, and requiring that some of the oscillators be initially synchronized.

Reference-contexts: This concludes the proof. The reported time for a human subject to identify a single object is estimated to be less than 100 ms. <ref> [9] </ref>. If oscillatory correlation is used by the brain, synchrony must be achieved before identification takes place. Experimental evidence from the cat visual cortex shows that synchrony is achieved quickly, within 25-50 ms., or 1-2 cycles in 40 Hz oscillations [30]. These experimental results emphasize the importance of fast synchrony.

Reference-contexts: Because of the neurophysiological importance of the W-C equations, several 3 authors have examined their mathematical properties [22,39,5,23,12]. Of particular relevance is a study by Cairns et al. <ref> [12] </ref>, which indicates that synchronization is possible with these equations. Despite extensive studies on W-C oscillators, it remains unclear to what extent a locally coupled network can exhibit global synchrony, and whether desynchronization can be achieved in different regions of the network, useful in many contexts.

Reference-contexts: Phase oscillators are generally defined as (3.1) where is the phase of the oscillator, is its intrinsic frequency. is the coupling strength between the and the oscillators, and is a periodic function. For phase oscillators with local diffusive coupling, and identical intrinsic frequencies, the in-phase solution is asymptotically stable <ref> [14] </ref>. But the phase model does not exhibit the rich variety of behaviors that other, more complex nonlinear oscillators, have when locally coupled. For the so called Brusselator, a model of chemical oscillation, stable states can arise or disappear, depending on initial conditions and the coupling strength [7].

Reference-contexts: In performing desynchronization, GS may accomplish a task that is fundamental to attention. GS also has structural similarities to a proposed neural attentional mechanism. Crick <ref> [15] </ref> suggested that the reticular complex of the thalamus may control attention, in part because it has connections both to and from many regions of the cortex. Thus, the reticular complex of the thalamus may have inuence over widely separated sensory processing regions.

Reference-contexts: The amplitudes of the variables symbolize the proportion of each population of neurons that is active. We use these equations because they represent neuronal groups, which may be the basic processing units in the brain <ref> [18] </ref>. In our model, each oscillator is analogous to a basic element in a sensory field, and responds only to the presence of stimulus. The W-C equations have a large number of parameters, which allow for a wide range of dynamics.

Oscillations have also been explored in associative recall networks [11,69,1]. With its computational properties plus the support of biological evidence, this model may offer a general approach to pattern segmentation and figure/ground segregation. Acknowledgments.

Reference-contexts: While some of these models demonstrate synchronization with local couplings [41,57,66,61], most rely on long range connections to achieve entrainment, since global connectivity can readily result in synchrony (see <ref> [29] </ref> for specific conditions). It has been argued that local connections may play a fundamental role in pattern segmentation, because global couplings lack topological mappings [59,67].

Singer, Eds. Weinheim: VC Henry Verlangsgesellschaft, </editor> <year> 1991. </year>
Reference-contexts: If oscillatory correlation is used by the brain, synchrony must be achieved before identification takes place. Experimental evidence from the cat visual cortex shows that synchrony is achieved quickly, within 25-50 ms., or 1-2 cycles in 40 Hz oscillations <ref> [30] </ref>. These experimental results emphasize the importance of fast synchrony. From practical considerations synchrony must also be achieved quickly in order to deal with a rapidly changing environment. In this model we can control the rate of synchrony by increasing the coupling strength.

Reference-contexts: The model retains information of spatial relationships through local coupling, and does not suffer from the problems of accidental synchrony through the use of a global separator to segregate objects. Although we have not attempted to simulate the experimental findings of Gray et al. <ref> [31] </ref>, the network is neurally plausible. The W-C equations represent the activities of neural groups, and local excitatory connections are consistent with lateral connections widely seen in the brain [38]. The global separator may be viewed as part of an attentional mechanism.

Reference-contexts: Desynchronization As discussed previously, a method of desynchronization is necessary for minimizing the possibility of accidental synchrony. Several models [54,64] have methods of desynchronization, but it is not clear how these models perform with more than two objects. In Hansel and Sompolinsky <ref> [33] </ref>, noise in a chaotic system is used to desynchronize objects, but noise can also lead to synchronizing objects. Hence this is not a reliable method of distinguishing multiple objects. In order to reliably desynchronize multiple objects, independent oscillations in an oscillator network cannot be permitted.

Reference-contexts: In many models synchronization is achieved, but the issue of desynchronization is not addressed. Objects in these models oscillate independently of one another. This independence allows for the possibility of accidental synchrony <ref> [36] </ref>. Accidental synchrony occurs when two or more objects are incorrectly grouped together because they have the same, or indistinguishable, phases. The probability that two objects are wrongly grouped can be substantial however, when one considers that synchrony is rarely perfect.

Reference-contexts: In our model desynchronization of multiple objects is accomplished with a Global Separator (GS), which receives input from the entire network, and feeds back to all oscillators. These global connections to and from GS make this architecture resemble that of the comparator model <ref> [37] </ref>. The comparator model uses long range connections to and from a comparator, a unit which commonly computes the average phase of all oscillators, to achieve synchrony. This architecture, however, phase locks every oscillator. Desynchronization then becomes problematic.

Reference-contexts: Different objects are represented by different groups whose oscillations are desynchronized from each other. Following Terman and Wang [61], we refer to this form of temporal correlation as oscillatory correlation. Given that brain waves are widespread in EEG recordings <ref> [38] </ref>, and the ubiquitous nature of the 40 Hz oscillations, it is possible for the brain to use oscillatory correlation as a method of solving the binding problem. <p> Although we have not attempted to simulate the experimental findings of Gray et al. [31], the network is neurally plausible. The W-C equations represent the activities of neural groups, and local excitatory connections are consistent with lateral connections widely seen in the brain <ref> [38] </ref>. The global separator may be viewed as part of an attentional mechanism. Experiments conducted by Treisman and Gelade [62] suggest that if an object has several features, a correct conjunction of those features relies on attention.

Reference-contexts: Thus any spatially separate object can be segmented, independent of its similarity to other objects in other features. That spatial segmentation is fundamental to perceptual processes is supported by the work of Keele et al. <ref> [40] </ref>, who show that spatial location is a basic cue for feature binding. Aside from explaining what may occur in the brain, oscillatory correlation offers a unique approach to the engineering of pattern segmentation, figure/ground segregation, and feature binding.

Reference-contexts: This limitation seems consistent with the well-known psychological result that humans have a fundamental bound on the number of objects that can be held in their attentional span <ref> [44] </ref>.

As expected, the system is robust for small amounts of noise, but cannot tolerate very large quantities.

Reference-contexts: The method described above can group many oscillators to within a small distance of one another, and therefore within a small distance of the in-phase solution. Because we have not shown that the actual W-C oscillators synchronize, a variational analysis <ref> [46] </ref> is appropriate. In this analysis all the variables are perturbed by a small amount from a known solution, in this case, the synchronous solution. The perturbations are assumed to be sufficiently small so that their first order approximations are valid.

Reference-contexts: This is because noise by itself can cause the nullclines to intersect and thus interfere with the mechanism we use to synchronize oscillators. The amount of noise the system can tolerate increases with the size of the coupling strength. We used the numerical ODE solvers found in <ref> [50] </ref> to conduct the above simulations. An adaptive Runga-Kutta method was used for most of the simulations reported. The Bulrisch-Stoer method was later used to confirm the numerical results. The network had the same dynamics with either of the integration methods.

Reference-contexts: Namely if the temporal average of activity, , is greater than the threshold, or if otherwise. With (2.4) in place, only neighboring excited oscillators will be effectively coupled. This is an implicit encoding of the Gestalt principle of connectedness <ref> [51] </ref>. With scalar diffusive coupling, the Hebbian rule defined above would destabilize the synchronous solution. To understand how the instability arises, consider three excited oscillators arranged in a row, and each with the same values of activities, i.e. , and .

Reference-contexts: But their simulations involve a small system and no analysis is made. It is also unknown how their results extend to more than two objects. In the model of Schillen and Knig <ref> [54] </ref>, the phases of two different objects are anti-correlated by desynchronizing connections between the objects. These desynchronizing connections are short range however, and two objects can oscillate independently if separated by a large enough distance.

Reference-contexts: For example, other layers can be introduced to code different features, with connections between layers used for binding various relationships. Motion sensitive layers, for instance, can be introduced as a potential method for segmentation based on direction of motion (see <ref> [59] </ref>). The network can be extended to handle gray level input also. Dynamic couplings between excited neighboring oscillators could then be based on the contrast in the gray level of the stimulus.

Reference-contexts: In this 2 scheme, each segment (object) is represented by a group of oscillators that are synchronized (phase-locked). Different objects are represented by different groups whose oscillations are desynchronized from each other. Following Terman and Wang <ref> [61] </ref>, we refer to this form of temporal correlation as oscillatory correlation. Given that brain waves are widespread in EEG recordings [38], and the ubiquitous nature of the 40 Hz oscillations, it is possible for the brain to use oscillatory correlation as a method of solving the binding problem. <p> Though this greatly reduces the chance of accidentally aligning the phases of two different objects, it does so at the cost of substantially increasing the computational time. There are few models that incorporate a method of desynchronization. Terman and Wang <ref> [61] </ref> give a rigorous analysis of desynchronization in coupled relaxation oscillators. However, relaxation oscillators have two time scales and are based on models of single cell voltages, so the analysis of Terman and Wang may not be applicable to the widely used W-C oscillators. <p> We also present a mechanism for desynchroni-zation, which can segment up to 9 spatially separate objects. Our mechanism requires only a basic control of speed through a single region of the limit cycle, so it too can be transferred to other oscillator models (see also <ref> [61] </ref>). The matrix analysis we have done for a chain of oscillators can be extended to analyze higher dimensional oscillator lattices. We conjecture that synchrony can also be achieved in more than two dimensions, with only a positive coupling strength.

Reference-contexts: The W-C equations represent the activities of neural groups, and local excitatory connections are consistent with lateral connections widely seen in the brain [38]. The global separator may be viewed as part of an attentional mechanism. Experiments conducted by Treisman and Gelade <ref> [62] </ref> suggest that if an object has several features, a correct conjunction of those features relies on attention. Thus, if feature binding is achieved through oscillatory correlation, the attentive mechanism may serve to synchronize features into a coherent object, as well as segment different objects.

Reference-contexts: However, relaxation oscillators have two time scales and are based on models of single cell voltages, so the analysis of Terman and Wang may not be applicable to the widely used W-C oscillators. In the simulations of von der Malsburg and Buhmann <ref> [64] </ref>, an approximation to the W-C equations is used, and a global inhibitor desynchronizes two segments, each corresponding to a group of fully connected oscillators. But their simulations involve a small system and no analysis is made. It is also unknown how their results extend to more than two objects.

Reference-contexts: How these features are correctly bound together to form objects is known as the feature binding problem. Theoretical considerations of brain functions suggest temporal correlations as a representational framework for perceptual grouping [45,63,2]. In the correlation theory of von der Malsburg and Schneider <ref> [65] </ref>, features are linked through temporal correlations in the firing patterns of different neurons. A natural implementation of temporal correlation is the use of neural oscillators, whereby each oscillator represents some feature (maybe just a picture element, or a pixel) of an object.

Reference-contexts: It also provides an elegant representation for real time processing. Given the enormous amount of information processing required by sensory processing, a parallel architecture and the potential for VLSI implementation are both very desirable qualities. Perceptual tasks involving neural oscillations have also been observed in audition [26,43, see Wang <ref> [68] </ref> for a model] and olfaction [25]. Oscillations have also been explored in associative recall networks [11,69,1]. With its computational properties plus the support of biological evidence, this model may offer a general approach to pattern segmentation and figure/ground segregation. Acknowledgments.

Reference-contexts: The W-C equations have a large number of parameters, which allow for a wide range of dynamics. These equations have been used widely in modelling various brain processes [24,5,41,10], in creating oscillatory recall networks <ref> [69] </ref>, and in exploring the binding problem [35,64,67]. Because of the neurophysiological importance of the W-C equations, several 3 authors have examined their mathematical properties [22,39,5,23,12]. Of particular relevance is a study by Cairns et al. [12], which indicates that synchronization is possible with these equations.

Reference-contexts: Because this spatial information is necessary for object recognition and segmentation, it must be preserved as effectively and as simply as possible. The use of local couplings is one method of maintaining such spatial relationships. In this paper, we study a network of locally coupled Wilson-Cowan (W-C) oscillators <ref> [70] </ref>. In particular, we investigate the properties of synchronization and desynchronization in such networks. Each oscillator is a two variable system of ordinary differential equations, and represents an interacting population of excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
