Reference-contexts: with uncertainties is also addressed here) collisions between the robot and objects unsuccessful operations (eg the lost of an object during its transport by the robot gripper) actions of external agents On the last years there is a trend in the direction of the implementation of reactive systems ([Georgeff-87], [Kaelbling-88], <ref> [Firby-89] </ref>). 2. SYSTEM OVERVIEW Sensing performs an important role on Assembly Robotics, either in the description of the current situation or in the monitoring of the task execution. Computer Vision is used to represent the current description of the objects to be handled during the assembly.

Reference-contexts: HANDEY [Lozano-Perez-89] includes a sensory system and performs grasping and regrasping operations for pick and place problems. The absence of reasoning about action is the main drawback of this system. An interesting system, created by Hutchinson and Kak, is SPAR <ref> [Hutchinson-90] </ref> using a three-level hierarchy with operational, geometric and uncertainty-reduction goals. SPAR is able to perform sensing operations during execution and to generate error-recovery plans. It does not include any subsystem to detect the positions and orientations of objects and the collision avoidance is not considered in SPAR.

Reference-contexts: The need to generate online plans rapidly has led to the search for more efficient algorithms. Many systems have been designed and implemented to solve the specific problem of Assembly Robotics. Let us focus our attention in just a few of them. HANDEY <ref> [Lozano-Perez-89] </ref> includes a sensory system and performs grasping and regrasping operations for pick and place problems. The absence of reasoning about action is the main drawback of this system. An interesting system, created by Hutchinson and Kak, is SPAR [Hutchinson-90] using a three-level hierarchy with operational, geometric and uncertainty-reduction goals.

Reference-contexts: Unexpected situations or exceptions, derived or not from the mismatch between the initial world description and the reality, must be treated. Therefore reactivity is also an important behavior in the framework of Intelligent Robotic Systems. The first system involving planning ideas was GPS <ref> [Newell-63] </ref>. Domain Independent Planning Systems of the seventies ([Fikes-72],[Newell-63],[Sacerdoti-74],[Sacerdoti-77],[Tate-77]) gave an important contribution to the theoretical foundations of automatic generation of plans. The Blocks World has been chosen as the favourite testbed to experiment planning. However, Assembly Robotics is a much more complex testbed.

Reference-contexts: The results of this agent have the following format: position (ObjectName, StableState,X,Y,Z,Orientation). It is very important to pay attention to some problems related with the output of VISION agent. Firstly, the generation of a high level plan requires the knowledge about symbolic relationships and constraints between objects <ref> [Ramos-89] </ref>. For these planners the information about stacking, insertions and obstructions between objects is more important than their locations given by VISION. World Description agent (WD) has been introduced to overcome this gap. This agent converts the numerical output of VISION into the appropriate set of symbolic relationships and constraints.
