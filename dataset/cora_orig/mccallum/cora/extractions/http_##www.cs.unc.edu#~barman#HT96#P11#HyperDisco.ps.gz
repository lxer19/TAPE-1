Abstract: This paper describes the HyperDisco approach to open hypermedia systems. HyperDisco provides an extensible object-oriented hypermedia platform supporting inter-tool linking, computation, concurrency control, notification control, version control, access control, query and search, and various other features. The present work has two main objectives: 1) to provide a platform to integrate existing and future distributed heterogeneous tools and data formats and 2) to provide a platform to extend integrated tools to handle multiple collaborating users and multiple versions of shared artifacts. The paper presents important dimensions of hypermedia platforms that helped to formulate the goals for HyperDisco, the HyperDisco prototype, and two integration examples to illustrate the distinctive features of the HyperDisco approach.

Reference-contexts: We have seen a rapidly growing interest in the design, development and deployment of open hyperme-dia platforms such as Sun's Link Service [13], Microcosm [2, 3], Proxhy [8], Multicard [14], DHM [4, 5], Hyperform [19], SP3 [9], and Chimera <ref> [1] </ref>. An open hypermedia platform supports inter-tool linking as a means of integrating distributed heterogeneous tools and data formats. System developers are supplied with an open system architecture including a link service and a storage subsystem typically referred to as a hyperbase management system (HBMS). <p> The link server category (Microcosm [2, 3], Proxhy [8], Multicard [14], Sun's Link Service [13] and Chimera <ref> [1] </ref>) makes the assumption that participating tools use other information repositories to store their documents and only use the hypermedia platform to store and retrieve connectivity information. This latter type of platform includes a link database instead of a HBMS. HyperDisco belongs to the open hyperbase category.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, information is stored in different formats and located in distributed heterogeneous information repositories. The lack of integration among tools and the information maintained by the tools has been identified as a major problem inherent in the current generation of computing environments <ref> [2, 11, 12] </ref>. Hypermedia linking provides a powerful solution to integration in existing and future computing environments, both with regard to the integration of different tools and the integration of different data formats and data exchange. <p> We have seen a rapidly growing interest in the design, development and deployment of open hyperme-dia platforms such as Sun's Link Service [13], Microcosm <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, Proxhy [8], Multicard [14], DHM [4, 5], Hyperform [19], SP3 [9], and Chimera [1]. An open hypermedia platform supports inter-tool linking as a means of integrating distributed heterogeneous tools and data formats. <p> The open hyperbase category (DHM [4, 5] and SP3 [9]) in-cludes a HBMS supporting a full hypermedia data model capable of providing storage to hypermedia tools as well as providing storage of connectivity information to third-party tools. The link server category (Microcosm <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, Proxhy [8], Multicard [14], Sun's Link Service [13] and Chimera [1]) makes the assumption that participating tools use other information repositories to store their documents and only use the hypermedia platform to store and retrieve connectivity information. <p> Most open hypermedia platforms provide a single integration model that all tools must adhere to. For example, Microcosm provides a simple integration model providing keyword (local and generic) and positional (specific) links <ref> [2] </ref>. Microcosm places a strong emphasis on computation and separation of connectivity information from documents (links are stored in linkbases). Users interact with "viewers".

Like Microcosm, HyperDisco supports different means for integrating heterogeneous third-party tools at different levels of participation. In the examples described in Section 4, Emacs was partially integrated with Hy-perDisco by a combination of source code adaptation and macro extension.

Reference-contexts: Composites are either static or dynamic (computed). A static composite contains a list of component OIDs, while a dynamic composite contains a script (query) evaluating to a list of component OIDs. Different composite sub-types are supported such as virtual composites capable of storing transient results of (structural) queries <ref> [6] </ref> and structured collections. The Component class (and thus its three subclasses: Node, Link and Composite) provides support for collaboration, query and search, and version and access control: Collaboration Support. HyperDisco provides short database transactions combined with user-controlled locking [20].

Reference-contexts: In this way, participating tools can extend and tailor the data model by adding new methods and specializing existing methods. All instances in HyperDisco have a unique object identifier (OID). Anchors (inspired by Dexter <ref> [7] </ref>) simply contain a value that specifies some location, region, item, or substructure within a component. If the anchor value is empty, the anchor is a whole-component anchor [4]. The smallest sharable unit in the model is an attribute. Components are collections of attributes.

Scalability. <p> A fully integrated tool must be able to communicate storage requests to HyperDisco and respond to hypermedia events. Fully integrated tools can bypass the integration model layer and communicate directly with the data model layer when making storage requests, like in the SP3 system <ref> [9] </ref>. In the partial integration case, the exact information exchanged depends on the chosen model of integration. The model must specify a way to uniquely identify the appropriate link in a follow-link request. <p> The open hyperbase category (DHM [4, 5] and SP3 <ref> [9] </ref>) in-cludes a HBMS supporting a full hypermedia data model capable of providing storage to hypermedia tools as well as providing storage of connectivity information to third-party tools.

Reference-contexts: The latter task is divided into two subtasks: specializing the integration model and specializing the data model of HyperDisco to provide the necessary services. In this section, we describe two tests on the integration and extension of a small selection of tools supporting authoring: a textual editor (GNU Emacs <ref> [16] </ref>), a document processing system (L A T E X), a dvi display tool (Xdvi), a conversion script (dvips), a postscript display tool (PageView) and a printer script. In the first test, we used an Anchor Link integration model to integrate the selected set of tools.
