Title: Genetic operators, the fitness landscape and the traveling salesman problem

Abstract: Edge Recombination and Maximal Preservative Crossover (MPX) are two operators developed to preserve edge information for the Traveling Salesman Problem. Manderick et al. introduced the notion of a fitness landscape to measure the fitness correlation between parents and offspring under different recombination operators. The work on the fitness landscape is extended by studying the interrelationship between the fitness landscape, operator failure rates (in terms of non-inherited edges) and the effect of operator failure on tour length. The use of local improvement operators is also examined.
