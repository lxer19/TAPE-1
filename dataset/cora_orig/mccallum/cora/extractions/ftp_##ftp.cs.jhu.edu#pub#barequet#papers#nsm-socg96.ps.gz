Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The problem of finding a full or a partial match between three-dimensional objects attracted considerable attention in the literature during the past decade. We omit here a review of the existing literature and refer the reader to the two comprehensive surveys <ref> [BJ, CD] </ref>, and to a companion paper [BS]. We are given two sets of points representing two respective objects in 3-space, and expected to be spread more or less uniformly on the boundary of the corresponding objects or in the volumes that they occupy.

[KSSS] and by Schwartz and Sharir [SS]. It builds upon an earlier algorithm that we have developed in <ref> [BS] </ref>. The new algorithm is based on the use of directed footprints, whereas the preceding algorithm used undirected footprints. Our algorithm does not depend on any correspondence between the two sets of input data points or on the existence of any predetermined features of the objects. <p> clearly visible at the top of the figure. (a) First dataset (b) Second dataset (c) Superpositioned datasets (d) 3D voting table Table 1 summarizes the performance of our implementation on the three examples described above. (The correct solution of the car example was not known; expected solution was taken from <ref> [BS] </ref>.) All the time measurements were taken on an IBM RS6000/41T workstation.
