Abstract: Most previous works on the interconnect design are based on a simple model which assumes that interconnection delay of a net is proportional to the total wirelength of the net. Such delay model becomes less and less realistic as the fabrication technology reaches submicron device dimensions and gigahertz frequency. In this paper, we study the interconnect design problem under a distributed RC model, and present efficient solutions to interconnect topology design and wiresizing problems for performance optimization. We study the impact of technology factors on the interconnect designs and present general formulations of the interconnect topology design and wiresizing problems. We show that interconnect topology optimization can be achieved by computing optimal generalized rectilinear Steiner arborescences and we present an efficient algorithm which yields optimal or near-optimal solutions. We reveal several important properties of optimal wire width assignments and present a polynomial time optimal wiresizing algorithm. Extensive experimental results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms other routing methods for high-performance IC and MCM designs. Our interconnect designs reduce the interconnection delays by up to

Reference-contexts: However, as the technology advances to smaller device dimensions, according to the CMOS scaling rule <ref> [1] </ref>, driver resistance decreases while wire resistance increases, which leads to a significant reduction of the resistance ratio. In this case, t 2 (T ) and t 3 (T ) can no longer be ignored in the design of new generation VLSI circuits.

Reference-contexts: Most previous works on this problem are based on a simplistic linear delay model of wirelength minimization, and many global routing algorithms based on the Steiner tree formulation have been proposed, such as <ref> [12, 2] </ref>. Although these methods produce good results in terms of wirelength minimization, they cannot achieve performance optimization in the design of high-speed ICs and MCMs. Moreover, uniform wire width has been used for the connections of most signal nets in the conventional routing methods.

Reference-contexts: Section 5.1 - 5.3 show the improvement achieved by the A-tree algorithm, the wiresizing algorithms, and the A-tree + Wiresizing algorithms, and Section 5.4 shows the impact of resistance ratio and transistor sizing. The results in Section 5.1 - 5.3 are based on a typical MCM technology <ref> [5] </ref> as shown in Table 4. We tested our algorithms on signal nets of 4, 8, and 16 sinks. For each net size, 100 nets were generated on a 100mm x 100 mm routing region for the MCM technology. The grid resolution is 25 m per unit-grid-length.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As the VLSI fabrication technology reaches submicron device dimension and gigahertz frequency, interconnection delay has become the dominant factor in determining circuit speed <ref> [6, 16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Very little is known about proper wiresizing for delay optimization. There is a strong need for systematic studies in the interconnect topology design and wiresizing problems for delay optimization in high-performance system designs. However, limited progress has been reported in the literature for the performance-driven interconnect design problem. In <ref> [7] </ref>, net priorities are determined based on static timing analysis; nets with high priorities are processed earlier using fewer feedthroughs. In [11], a hierarchical approach to timing-driven routing was outlined. In [13], a timing-driven global router based on the A* heuristic search algorithm was proposed in building-block designs.

Reference-contexts: There are several reasons that we choose this delay model: (i) Although this model is simpler than the commonly used Elmore delay model <ref> [8] </ref> for distributed RC circuits, it still captures the distributed nature of the circuit; (ii) It gives an accurate upper bound of signal delay at every node and correlates very well with the Elmore delay [15]; (iii) It is much easier to use for interconnect design optimization since it gives a

Reference-contexts: Moreover, none of these algorithms study the impact of wiresizing on interconnect delay minimization.

Reference-contexts: Definition 1 A rectilinear Steiner tree T is called an A-tree if every path connecting the source N 0 and any node p on the tree is a shortest path. Notice that A-trees are generalization of the rectilinear Steiner arborescences studied in <ref> [14] </ref>. <p> Without loss of generality, we consider only the case when all the sinks are restricted to the first quadrant (i.e. when the A-tree becomes an arborescence). There are several well established results regarding arborescences 8 in the literature. In particular, Rao, et al. <ref> [14] </ref> presented a number of fundamental properties of the rectilinear Steiner arborescence problem. Besides, most of the discussions on arborescences are also applicable to the general A-trees. <p> in each quadrant satisfying specific boundary conditions, and selecting the best topology among all possible combinations of tree topologies considered, we can use an arborescence algorithm to construct general A-trees, and the overall complexity of the new algorithm is O (n 2 ) times that of the original arborescence algorithm <ref> [14] </ref>. Hence, we focus on solving the rectilinear Steiner arborescence problem from now on. Unless explicitly specified, we will assume that the source N 0 is located at (0; 0), and all other sinks have nonnegative x- and y-coordinates. <p> In this case, we need to perform a heuristic move a move that may not be optimal. In this paper, we will use the following two heuristic moves suggested by Rao et al. <ref> [14] </ref>. 1.

Reference-contexts: Although wiresizing was used by Fisher and Kung [9] in H-tree clock routing, the general wiresizing problem for arbitrary routing topology has not been well studied before. In this paper, we study the interconnect design problem under a distributed RC delay model developed by Rubinstein, Penfield and Horowitz <ref> [15] </ref>.

In this paper, we use a distributed RC delay model developed by Rubinstein, Penfield, and Horowitz <ref> [15] </ref>. Given a distributed RC circuit, the signal delay at a node is computed as follows: t = all nodes k R k C k (1) where R k is the resistance between the source and the node k and C k is capacitance at the node k. <p> delay model: (i) Although this model is simpler than the commonly used Elmore delay model [8] for distributed RC circuits, it still captures the distributed nature of the circuit; (ii) It gives an accurate upper bound of signal delay at every node and correlates very well with the Elmore delay <ref> [15] </ref>; (iii) It is much easier to use for interconnect design optimization since it gives a uniform upper bound of the delay at every node.

Reference-contexts: Although Equations 4-7 are obtained from a distributed RC delay model, the impact of resistance ratio on interconnection design is true for distributed RLC delay model as well.

Reference-contexts: If node k is a sink, then C k is the loading capacitance at the node. If there is a via at node k, it can also be formulated by adding some extra capacitance at the node <ref> [18] </ref>, which reflects the distributed nature of interconnection delay. For simplicity, we assume that C k is non-zero only when node k is a sink, but wire capacitance C 0 is present at every node. <p> The average delay of each net is obtained by averaging the signal delay at every sink using the two-pole circuit simulator developed by Zhou et al. <ref> [18] </ref>. Extensive experimental results have shown that the two-pole simulator is comparable to SPICE in terms of delay simulation, but runs much faster [18]. <p> The average delay of each net is obtained by averaging the signal delay at every sink using the two-pole circuit simulator developed by Zhou et al. <ref> [18] </ref>.
