Abstract: This paper presents a study of the statistical characteristics and multiplexing of Variable-Bit-Rate (VBR) MPEG-coded video streams. Our results are based on 23 minutes of video obtained from the entertainment movie, The Wizard of Oz. The experimental setup which was used to capture, digitize, and compress the video stream is described. Although the study is conducted at the frame level (as opposed to the slice level), it is observed that the inter-frame correlation structure for the frame-size sequence involves complicated forms of pseudo-periodicity that are mainly affected by the compression pattern of the sequence. A simple model for an MPEG traffic source is developed in which frames are generated according to the compression pattern of the original captured video stream. The number of cells per frame is fitted by a lognormal distribution. Simulations are used to study the performance of an ATM multiplexer for MPEG streams.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the output of a video codec is a VBR stream. Unlike conventional data networks, ATM networks provide efficient support for VBR traffic. Several traffic models have been proposed to characterize compressed video streams (see <ref> [1] </ref> for a survey). The parameters of these models were obtained by matching certain statistical characteristics of an actual video sequence and the model under consideration. Particular emphasis was on matching the mean, variance, and more importantly the correlation structure of the bits-per-frame sequence.

Reference-contexts: Particular emphasis was on matching the mean, variance, and more importantly the correlation structure of the bits-per-frame sequence. Correlations arise naturally in compressed video traffic and their patterns are largely determined by the type of video (e.g., videophone, motion-picture, teleconferencing) as well as by the compression algorithm used. In <ref> [2] </ref>, the authors used a 10-second long sequence of video (from a videophone) to develop their traffic models. A two-hour DCT-compressed sequence (with no motion compensation) for the movie Star Wars was described in [3]. <p> The other type of correlations result from inter-frame compression which exploits the temporal redundancy in the data. Previous researchers who investigated the correlation structure of video streams observed a negative exponential shape for the inter-frame autocorrelation function <ref> [2, 8, 4, 7] </ref>. In MPEG, the three modes of compression are employed in a periodic fashion on a frame-by-frame basis (defined by the compression pattern), which produce persistent periodicity in the inter-frame autocorrelation structure.

We assume that the cells-per-frame sequence of a video stream is a stationary stochastic process. This assumption is used to generate multiple streams of video from the captured frame-size trace. Following the approach of Heyman et al. <ref> [4] </ref>, the trace is arranged as a circular list by connecting its ends. For each video source (in trace-driven simulations only), the first frame is randomly selected from the list and the remaining frames follow it according to the sequential order of the list.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, individual frames may be coded as I, P, or B frames (intra-frame, predictive, or bidirectional, respectively). The I frames use DCT while the B and P frames use motion compensation to compress the video stream. Details of the MPEG standard can be found elsewhere (see <ref> [6] </ref>). The pattern and other important parameters used to encode our sample are shown in Table 1.

Reference-contexts: The first type is the result of intra-frame compression provided through DCT coding. In this case, correlations appear when the VBR sequence is studied at a smaller level than a frame, such as a slice-level <ref> [7] </ref> (a slice is taken here as a horizontal strip in an image). A pseudo-periodic intra-frame correlation structure was observed in [7] when the sequence was studied at a slice-level.
