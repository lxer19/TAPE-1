Abstract: We have developed a computer system for modeling mechanical physiological behavior in an interactive, 3D virtual environment. Such an environment can be used to facilitate exploration of cardiopulmonary physiology, particularly in situations that are difficult to reproduce clinically. We integrate 3D deformable body dynamics with new, formal models of (scalar) cardiorespiratory physiology, associating the scalar physiological variables and parameters with corresponding 3D anatomy. Our approach is amenable to modeling patient-specific circumstances in two ways. First, using CT scan data, we apply semiautomatic methods for extracting and reconstructing the anatomy to use in our simulations. Second, our scalar models are defined in terms of clinically-measurable, patient-specific parameters. This paper describes our approach, problems we have encountered, and a sample of results showing normal breathing and acute effects of pneumothoraces.

Reference-contexts: Modeling realistic, 3D anatomy is currently in the domain of `anatomical atlases,' such as the many efforts involving the Visible Human Project <ref> [1] </ref>. These projects have reconstructed actual patient images to present static models that can be viewed from arbitrary angles and cross-sections. Any `physiology' typically implies they have labeled the parts or given more detailed descriptions. Recently, there has been great interest focused on endoscopic simulation and other minimally-invasive procedures.

Reference-contexts: Recently, there has been great interest focused on endoscopic simulation and other minimally-invasive procedures. These programs are mostly developed for very specific procedures and do not let the user explore consequences of incorrect actions. Emerson et al <ref> [2] </ref> have compiled an extensive bibliography on virtual reality in medicine. There are a number of patient simulation programs derived from complex mathematical models, with current commercial products mainly for anesthesia training [6, 10]. These approaches rely on more sophisticated mathematical models for physiological systems than the surgical simulators.

Reference-contexts: The reconstructed versions of these data sets became the boundary conditions for our 3D simulation. Using 2D deformable contours (`snakes') in a program developed by colleagues at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, we segmented the images. Once we recovered the shapes, we used public-domain software by Hoppe <ref> [3] </ref> to reduce their resolution. This was a necessary step because the original shapes were too detailed computationally for our use. (a) (b) (c) Fig. 1.

Reference-contexts: The physical analog for the model we have implemented is illustrated in Fig. 2. It consists of two lungs, the mediastinum, the rib cage, the diaphragm, the abdomen, and the common junction (explained in <ref> [4] </ref>). We also provide for bilateral intrapleural spaces of non-zero volume changes to model pneumothoraces. In the physical analog, the chest wall components are represented as (massless) disks that move within a conceptual cylinder. <p> As a first approximation, we model the mediastinum and its contents computationally as an elastic membrane. an elastic membrane. We solve the system of ordinary differential equations corresponding to Fig. 2 explicitly over time using conventional numerical methods. The equations are derived completely from the diagram|see <ref> [4] </ref> for details. We currently model the passive elements as viscoelastic.

Reference-contexts: Generally, these systems use a simple mechanics model with a single degree of freedom chest wall (described in <ref> [5] </ref>). This can be expanded to have multiple lung compartments, but one cannot investigate the effects of different muscle recruitments or anomalies within the chest wall. <p> The structures with kinematics are updated with linear interpolation. The structures with dynamics are viscoelastic spring-mass systems, updated with the Newto-nian equation of motion P f = ma (described in <ref> [5] </ref>). The rib cage, diaphragm, and mediastinum are modeled with kinematics. Their displacements are interpolated based on the values of pressure and volume variables with which they are associated.

Reference-contexts: We compute the damping coefficient d from k by assuming that the lung parenchyma is roughly critically damped (d = k=sqrt (2)). 4.3 Scalar Modeling Respiratory Mechanics We developed our ventilation model by extending the work of Primiano <ref> [7] </ref>. The physical analog for the model we have implemented is illustrated in Fig. 2. It consists of two lungs, the mediastinum, the rib cage, the diaphragm, the abdomen, and the common junction (explained in [4]). We also provide for bilateral intrapleural spaces of non-zero volume changes to model pneumothoraces.

Reference-contexts: Cardiovascular Mechanics To simulate basic cardiovascular mechanics, we adapted Rideout's PF-1 model <ref> [8] </ref> which incorporates linear and non-linear (time-varying ventricular-compliance) elements. Our model has five segments for the systemic circulation, five for the pulmonary circulation, and four heart chambers.

Reference-contexts: The surface of the vessels is modeled as a deformable mesh. The Lungs For small lung volume changes about an operating point, such as tidal breathing, the lung acts like an isotropic solid, i.e., it expands equally in all directions. This is true regardless of the operating point <ref> [9] </ref>. The behavior is most likely due to the expansion of the alveoli. For large volume changes, the lung cannot be modeled as an isotropic solid, because large changes involve changes in airway dimensions in addition to alveoli expansion.
