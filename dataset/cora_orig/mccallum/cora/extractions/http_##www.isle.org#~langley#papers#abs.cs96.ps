Abstract: In this paper we review the benefits of abstract computational models of cognition and present one such model of behavior in a flight-control domain. The model's central assumptions are that differences among subjects are due to differences in sensing skills, and that the main form of learning involves updating statistics to distinguish relevant from irrelevant features. We report an implementation of this abstract model of sensory learning, along with a system that searches the space of parameter settings in order to fit the model to observations. We compare the sensory-learning framework to an alternative based on the power law, finding that the latter fits the data slightly better but that it requires many more parameters. Many cognitive scientists view this progression as a positive development, leading toward what Newell (1990) has called unified theories of cognition. Nevertheless, computational models still require developers to introduce many assumptions, many not central to their theories, before they can produce behaviors and predictions. Moreover, features of models that developers do hold central are often not the source of their models' ability to explain psychological data. One example comes from Richman and Simon (1989), who argue that connectionist and discrimination-network explanations of word-recognition findings are due not to these models' core assumptions of parallel versus sequential processing, but from the way both models structure the task.

Reference-contexts: A Model of Unskilled Sensing Our approach to modeling human behavior in the Phoenix domain builds on the Icarus architecture <ref> (Langley, 1996) </ref>, in which the basic unit of knowledge is the qualitative state. Each state S specifies a set of conditions that must hold for S to be active, along with optional information about actions to be performed during S, the effects of these actions, and likely successor states.

Reference-contexts: This approach to content-oriented abstract models might even let one distinguish between classes of knowledge, such as functional and structural <ref> (e.g., Stroulia & Goel, 1992) </ref>, given these classes have different implications for subject's behavior. Concluding Remarks In this paper we reviewed an approach to cognitive simulation that Ohlsson and Jewett (1995) have called abstract models.
