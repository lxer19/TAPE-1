Reference-contexts: The 2 constraints are necessary to maintain throughput while guarding against contention in the transform memory. This problem bears semblance to the System of Distinct Representatives (SDR) problem <ref> [24] </ref> that arises in combinatorial matching theory, only here we are given the SDRs (each row can be considered to be an SDR) and asked to implicitly construct the family of subsets. No known polynomial algorithm exists; in fact it is unknown if this problem is always solvable.

Reference-contexts: No artificial constraints are imposed on the video object - for example, that it has to be rectangular in shape or non-overlapping with other objects. Considerable efforts have been vested in single user compositing systems. Kamata et al. at Fujitsu <ref> [8] </ref> and Katseff et al. at AT&T [9] have described hardware systems for opaque overlapping of rectangular video objects; Pixel Semiconductor [10] has introduced a two-chip set offering similar functionality.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we describe two new architectures that represent cost-effective solutions for multi-user compositing, yet retain enough exibility to realize the variety of applications described. 2.0 Problem Definition The class of compositing functions is very rich. The VideoStation <ref> [11] </ref>, for example, can handle antialiasing, transparency, and arbitrarily shaped objects. <p> The compositing computation itself is also distributed onto M*N processor. A frame buffer and a processor are paired up to form a module, one module per source per user. This scheme is architecturally equivalent to giving a Vid-eoStation <ref> [11] </ref> to each user, since the VideoStation follows precisely this paradigm. 1. Single-port memory is assumed. Current multi-port memories are too small to implement video frame buffers, and are not in themselves an extensible solution for multiple users.

Reference-contexts: The throughput varies from user to user depending on the resolution and refresh rate of each users display. The latency bound is more relaxed (lip-sync delays of up to 100ms are tolerable for videoconferencing <ref> [18] </ref>) and often common to all users. Although different users and sources generally have different image formats and resolutions, we can perform rate conversion for each source (frame dropping/repeating and up/down sampling) such that all inputs have identical atom and frame rates. <p> Source contention or user contention appears unavoidable because, as we show later, it is impossible to perform multi-source, multi-user compositing without some form of source or user buffering. 3.0 Memory Efficient Strategies One multi-user compositing scheme has been suggested by Lukacs <ref> [18] </ref>. In this approach, none of the user streams are buffered, so user contention does not exist.

Reference-contexts: An atom is a pel if we composite in the spatial domain, or a block of Discrete Cosine Transform coefficients if we composite in the DCT domain [15][16][17]. To support objects of arbitrary shape, we assume each atom in a stream has a one-bit alpha value <ref> [23] </ref> to indicate if the atom is visible or not.
