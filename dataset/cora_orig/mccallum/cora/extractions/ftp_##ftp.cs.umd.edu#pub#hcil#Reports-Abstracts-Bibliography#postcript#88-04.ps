Abstract: A study comparing the speed, accuracy, and user satisfaction of three different touchscreen strategies was performed. The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate the merits of the more intricate touch strategies that are possible on touchscreens that return a continuous stream of touch data. The results showed that a touch strategy providing continuous feedback until a selection was confirmed had fewer errors than other touch strategies. The implications of the results for touchscreens containing small, densely-packed targets are discussed. Sparks of Innovation in Human-Computer Interaction,

Reference-contexts: There were no significant differences between these two particular strategies in task completion time or number of errors. We also have recently become aware of other attempts to create a takeoff strategy <ref> (Eller, 1987) </ref>. The characteristics of the touch strategies we used in this experiment are: l.Land-On: cursor is directly under the finger only the position of the first impact with the screen is used a selection is made upon first impact if a target exists at that location 2.

Reference-contexts: This highlighting gave the user even more feedback as to what would be selected should the finger be removed from the touchscreen. A related experiment used an infrared touchscreen that could register multiple touches <ref> (Murphy, 1986) </ref>. Seven touch strategies were tested in the experiment. The subjects were to select from 60 targets which were 3/4 inch square and displayed in a grid that was six high by ten wide.

Reference-contexts: However, widespread use of touchscreens has been limited by the high error rates shown in many studies, lack of precision, fatigue in arm motion, and concern for screen smudging <ref> (Ostroff & Shneiderman, Pickering, 1986) </ref>. Common touchscreen applications include information kiosks at airports or shopping malls, educational games, and exhibits at museums and amusement parks. The simplicity of touchscreen usage is attractive for novices and the durability of touchscreens is favored by designers.
