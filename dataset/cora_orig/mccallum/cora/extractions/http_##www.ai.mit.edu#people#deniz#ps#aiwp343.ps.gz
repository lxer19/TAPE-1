Abstract: I would have liked to start this paper by first presenting a coherent model of human memory. After describing the functional components of the model and the structural components of the model, I would review the studies that provide evidence for each component and the interrelations between the components. After several sleepless nights, I gave up on this dream. And I decided that it was not my fault. The main reason why it is not my fault is that if such a coherent model was deducible from the data collected so far, one of the many intelligent people who devoted life times on this ideal would have come up with it. Unfortunately the data is sketchy. It highlights a few pieces here, and a few pieces there. Not only are the connections between different findings poorly understood, in most cases the interpretation of a single finding is still under debate. Given this picture, my review could mirror nothing but the sketchy character of the available data.

Reference-contexts: Ambros-Ingerson and colleagues worked on a simulation of the olfactory learning in rabbits using the same principles as Gluck and Thompson <ref> [Ambros-Ingerson et al., 1990] </ref>. They modeled layers I and II of the olfactory paleocortex, as connected to its primary input structure, olfactory bulb.

Reference-contexts: The predominant approach to long term memory in this era had been the associative interference theory, which emphasized the importance of relatively automatic and passive formation of stimulus-response bonds. Studies against this hypothesis were seen from time to time such as the work of the British psychologist Frederic Bartlett <ref> [Bartlett, 1932] </ref>. Bartlett proposed schemas organized mental structures as the key element in remembering. He emphasized that memory is a process of active reconstruction rather than a mere revival of previous experience.

Reference-contexts: Different systems have different physical organization of the neurons and different input and output relationships, but the same learning principles may apply to them in general. Barto and Jordan proposed a novel learning algorithm for neural networks that might be biologically more plausible than the standard back propagation <ref> [Barto and Jordan, 1987] </ref>. The standard algorithm for learning in artificial neural networks involves comparing the output of the network with the desired output, and propagating the gradient of the error backwards through the connections to make the network gradually approach the desired setting.

Reference-contexts: Some authors have suggested that the mechanism of LTP is enhanced neurotransmit-ter release, others that it is increased postsynaptic sen sitivity to transmitter, and still others believe that both maybe the case. Bekkers and Stevens report a molecular mechanism that behaves similarly via a pre-synaptic mechanism <ref> [Bekkers and Stevens, 1990] </ref>. Their analysis of the statistical properties of synaptic transmission, before and after the induction of long term potentiation, suggest that expression of LTP largely arises in a presy-naptic mechanism an increased probability of transmitter release.

Reference-contexts: Finally, Hebb hypothesized that any cell assembly could be excited by others. So particular thoughts could occur in the absence of the original event they correspond to. This was the basis for thought and ideation. The work by Bliss, Gardner-Medwin and Ltmo demonstrated the phenomenon of long term potentiation <ref> [Bliss and Lomo, 1973] </ref>. They electrically stimulated perforant path fibers to the dentate area of the hippocampal formation of rabbits. They measured the magnitude of the response of cells that are known to receive projections from the stimulation area using mi-croelectrodes.

Reference-contexts: He also distinguished between what he called primary memory, one that endured for a very brief time, and secondary memory, "the knowledge of a former state of mind after it has already once dropped from the consciousness". It is surprising that, not until 1958 <ref> [Broadbent, 1958] </ref>were separate short-term and long-term memories specifically postulated. Although a number of scientists had been collecting data and theorizing about memory, it is not unfair to 1 say that Hermann Ebbinghaus set the stage for a cen-tury long sequence of studies for the analysis of memory.

Reference-contexts: The ability to articulate words is learnt in childhood. In his classic work, Broca commented "Is it not, after all, a kind of memory, and those who have lost it have lost, not the memory for words, but the memory of the procedures required for articulating words" <ref> [Broca, 1861] </ref>. Ewald Hering, in his famous 1870 lecture at the Vi-enna Academy of Sciences emphasized the role of memory in cognition as a unifying force that holds the self together [Hering, 1920]. He proposed the concept of an "organic memory" involved in heredity, development, and habit.

Reference-contexts: This probably shows that damage to brain regions in addition to those damaged in amnesia must occur at relatively early stages of the Alzheimer's disease. Buckner and colleagues analyzed PET scans of subjects during explicit and implicit memory retrieval tasks <ref> [Buckner, 1995] </ref>. The three different tasks they gave the subjects were explicit recall of previously presented study words, implicit priming effects without intentional recall and a baseline task of retrieval of information from a general knowledge store. Many activations were found to be consistent across experiments.

Reference-contexts: He proposed the concept of an "organic memory" involved in heredity, development, and habit. William Carpenter, in one of the earliest treatises on physiological psychology <ref> [Carpenter, 1874] </ref>, argued that motor memory or habit should be distinguished from recollection of personal experiences. The famous American psychologist William James, in his 1890 classic "Principles of Psychology" [James, 1890] treated memory and habit in separate chapters.

Reference-contexts: He showed nearly normal improvement from session to session. He could be trained to acquire perceptual skills, such as reading of briefly presented words, or mirror reading. Cohen and Corkin showed a similar result on the Tower of Hanoi puzzle in 1981 <ref> [Cohen and Corkin, 1981] </ref>. This is a qualitatively different result, since the puzzle involves mental operations beyond just motor coordination or simple perception. H. M. was able to learn the procedures necessary to perform this cognitive skill, even though he did not have any declarative memory of performing the task.

Reference-contexts: H. M. had a normal learning curve for this task. On later days, even though he denied having performed the task previously, he retained his skill. Corkin trained H. M. on various other manual tracking and coordination tasks <ref> [Corkin, 1968] </ref>. He showed nearly normal improvement from session to session. He could be trained to acquire perceptual skills, such as reading of briefly presented words, or mirror reading. Cohen and Corkin showed a similar result on the Tower of Hanoi puzzle in 1981 [Cohen and Corkin, 1981].

Reference-contexts: After the operation, H. M. experienced a severe anterograde memory impairment that persisted to this day. Having been studied for more than 40 years, H. M. can be considered the single patient that has provided the largest collection of data to the students of memory <ref> [Corkin, 1984] </ref> [Milner, 1968]. H. M.'s syndrome is surprisingly isolated. His impairment is mostly limited to his inability to register new facts in his long term memory. His IQ is above average. His perceptual abilities are normal except his odor 4 discrimination.

Reference-contexts: ablations interfere with a variety of learning and memory tasks, that hippocampus contains place units (Hebb's cognitive map of the external world), and it was involved primarily in learning tasks that rely heav ily on spatial cues. [O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978]. 8 A more recent review by Eichenbaum and col-leagues <ref> [Eichenbaum et al., 1992] </ref>, addresses four questions about the hippocampus: What is the fundamental nature of memory supported by the hippocampal system, what is the contribution of the hippocampus itself among closely related structures to memory, how is information encoded by the activity of hippocampal neurons, and does hippocampus actually store

Reference-contexts: Ebbinghaus still is regarded as the father of the cognitive science of memory. At the turn of the century, Freud published his much debated theories on psychoanalysis <ref> [Freud, 1900] </ref>. Although much of what he had said is dismissed because of being unscientific, and never mentioned in the contemporary cognitive science courses, he did have interesting hypotheses about the workings of the mind. Memory played quite an important role in his psychoanalytic theory.

Reference-contexts: The study suggests that the activity of these neurons represent the intent to make eye movements of specific direction and magnitude. Funahashi and colleagues showed that the dorsolateral prefrontal area (Area 46) contains a structure that codes the spatial locations of stimuli <ref> [Funahashi et al., 1989] </ref>. This area is very close to the frontal eye fields (Area 8), which play a critical role in planned sequences of eye movements. The area Funahashi studied is spatially organized and has precise connections to the regions of the parietal lobe studied by Gnadt and Andersen.

Reference-contexts: However, in this section, I will review the current findings about the architecture of memory. Fuster and Jervey showed that temporal lobe structures that are involved in encoding visual information during perception are also involved in storing that information <ref> [Fuster and Jervey, 1982] </ref>. This clearly suggests that different types of information are stored differently. If perceptual structures also serve to store information, properties of memory function must be understood within the context of the perceptual function.

Reference-contexts: The other type cuts across content domains, such as unitary faculties of memory, judgment, perception and so forth. Gall commented that "Perception and memory are only attributes common to the fundamental faculties, but not the fundamental faculties themselves" <ref> [Gall, 1835] </ref>. Spurzheim elaborated Gall's ideas and argued that each mental faculty has a separate memory, relying on observations of within individual variations in memory abilities [Spurzheim, 1834].

Reference-contexts: Hawkins and Kandel described a different mechanism that does not depend on simultaneous events in pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons, but rather rely on neurochemical events within the sending neuron. Gluck and Thompson studied the phenomena in Alyp-sia using a computational model <ref> [Gluck and Thompson, 1987] </ref>. They developed a computational model of the neural substrates of elementary associative learning, using the neural circuits known to govern classical conditioning of the withdrawal response of Alypsia.

Reference-contexts: Gnadt and Andersen showed that memory representations used to guide eye movements are represented at least in part in posterior parietal cortical areas that are used in motor control <ref> [Gnadt and Andersen, 1988] </ref>. They performed studies in the rhesus monkey during tasks which required saccadic eye movements to remembered target locations in the dark.

W., editor, Synaptic plasticity. </editor> <publisher> Guil-ford Press. </publisher>
Reference-contexts: In an extensive set of experiments by Greenough and his colleagues it has been shown that when animals are trained for specific tasks or exposed to specific environments there are changes in the dendrites of neurons <ref> [Greenough and Chang, 1985] </ref>. Greenough has shown that an increase in the number of dendrites is accompanied by an increase in the number of synapses, which might account for functional changes. In addition, the quality of the synapses, new or old, are known to change in long term potentiation.

Reference-contexts: Studies on simple animals to discover the neural underpinnings of learning has made significant contributions to our understanding of the mechanisms of memory. Hawkins and Kandel suggested that higher forms of learning may be based on the mechanisms of simple forms of habituation, sensitization and conditioning <ref> [Hawkins and Kandel, 1984] </ref>. Studies on the invertebrate Aplysia showed that the siphon withdrawal reflex in this animal is an extension of the mechanism underlying sensitization.

Reference-contexts: Since this review is focused on the neu-roscience, I will not dive into any more detail of the pure cognitive approach. One last bit of history I would like to go into before I close the section is the work of Hebb <ref> [Hebb, 1949] </ref>. Hebb went a step further from the behavioral data and developed a theory of the neurological basis of short-term and long-term memory in his classical book "Organization of Behavior". He invented Hebbian learning rule that models the change in a neural network by repeated experience.

Reference-contexts: It seems plausible that these changes occur in the systems that process the original information. Kolb discusses three questions that need to be answered if this theory happens to be true <ref> [Kolb and Whishaw, 1990a] </ref>. The first concern is that neurons in the lower levels of processing, such as primary visual cortex, should not change much, otherwise the information sent to higher areas would be radically different.

Reference-contexts: In 1950 he concluded that "it is not possible to demonstrate the isolated localization of a memory trace anywhere in the nervous system. Limited regions may be essential for learning or retention of a particular activity, but ... the engram is represented throughout the region" <ref> [Lashley, 1950] </ref>. Ironically, only three years later a neurosurgeon named William Scoville made one of the most influential discoveries of neuropsychology. He removed the hippocampus bilaterally from patient H. M. to cure his epilepsy and unexpectedly created the most famous and most studied subject of amnesia in history.

Reference-contexts: Associationist approach was finally taken over by organization theory and related cognitive approaches that highlighted the active and constructive nature of the mnemonic processes after the work of researchers such as Tulving [Tulving, 1962] and Mandler <ref> [Mandler, 1968] </ref>. Until very recently, the cognitive science of memory have been largely developed independent of the neuroscience perspective, and researchers have done little to connect their theories to neural matter.

Reference-contexts: His work still remains the best attempt to combine the principles of psychological reality and the facts of neuroscience. 3 Cells In his much cited work Marr stressed the idea that psychological phenomena can be understood at multiple levels of analysis <ref> [Marr, 1982] </ref>. He separated what is computed, how it is computed and the level of implementation from each other. Although this distinction clarified the way of thinking in some domains, it did not help too much in others.

Reference-contexts: He removed the hippocampus bilaterally from patient H. M. to cure his epilepsy and unexpectedly created the most famous and most studied subject of amnesia in history. In the meanwhile studies in the cognitive science of memory were independently pursued by researchers such as Miller <ref> [Miller, 1956] </ref> and Sperling [Sperling, 1960]. These researchers concentrated on short term memory, and were influenced by the Ebbinghausian tradition at the methodological level.

Reference-contexts: For example he knows what an astronaut is, a public figure named Kennedy was assassinated and what rock music is. Although H. M.'s general knowledge is meager, it is not completely void. H. M. has been tested on different maze learning tasks <ref> [Milner, 1970] </ref>. These are typically tasks in which the subjects tries to learn a path on a board with his fingers. He failed to acquire to correct route even after extensive testing.

Reference-contexts: The interactions between these regions are still speculative. However several models have started to emerge from animal and human studies. Mishkin outlined the architecture of an entire memory system based on findings from animal studies <ref> [Mishkin, 1982] </ref>. He theorized about the possible role of the hippocampus and related structures in a model of interacting components. Mishkin postulates that coded representations of stimuli are stored in the higher-order sensory areas of the cortex whenever stimulus activation of these areas also triggers a cortico-limbo-thalamo-cortical circuit.

Reference-contexts: During the delay, a substantial contingent of cells showed increased, sustained, and in some cases, color-dependent discharge. Fuster and Jervey propose that these cells are engaged in temporary retention of the sample stimulus. Miyashita and Chang performed a similar study using complex visual stimuli <ref> [Miyashita and Chang, 1988] </ref>. They found a group of shape-selective neurons in an anterior ventral part of the temporal cortex of monkeys that exhibit sustained activity during the delay period of a visual short term memory task.

Reference-contexts: A large body of animal research since then showed that hippocampal ablations interfere with a variety of learning and memory tasks, that hippocampus contains place units (Hebb's cognitive map of the external world), and it was involved primarily in learning tasks that rely heav ily on spatial cues. <ref> [O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978] </ref>. 8 A more recent review by Eichenbaum and col-leagues [Eichenbaum et al., 1992], addresses four questions about the hippocampus: What is the fundamental nature of memory supported by the hippocampal system, what is the contribution of the hippocampus itself among closely related structures to memory, how is

Reference-contexts: It is seen in chronic alcoholics and thought to be due to lack of vitamin B1. The disease results in degeneration of medial thalamus, mamillary bodies and generalized cerebral atrophy. Symptoms appear within a few days. Sanders and Warrington describe six major symptoms in their seminal paper on Korsakoff <ref> [Sanders and Warrington, 1971] </ref>. Anterograde amnesia, general retrograde amnesia (unlike temporal lobe patients), confabulation (making up plausible stories for past events), lack of insight (they are typically unaware of their defect), and apathy. Most of these symptoms are clearly in contrast with temporal lobe patients like H. M.

Reference-contexts: M. show a rather different kind of dichotomy; explicit vs implicit memory. Explicit memories can be accessed to guide multiple types of behavior and can rise to consciousness, whereas implicit memories are tied to specific contexts and cannot be accessed deliberately or detected except in special circumstances. Schacter <ref> [Schacter, 1987] </ref>, gives a nice review of the implicit memory research. Savings during relearning, effects of subliminally encoded stimuli, learning and conditioning without awareness, repetition priming effects and findings on amnesic patients like H. M. are some of the evidence for implicit memory.

Reference-contexts: Savings during relearning, effects of subliminally encoded stimuli, learning and conditioning without awareness, repetition priming effects and findings on amnesic patients like H. M. are some of the evidence for implicit memory. Shimamura and colleagues studied the effects of word priming in dementia and amnesia <ref> [Shimamura et al., 1987] </ref>. They tested both word completion priming and verbal memory ability in patients with Alzheimer's disease, patients with Korsakoff's syndrome, and patients with Hunting-ton's disease. Alzheimer's disease causes amnesia because of the degeneration of corticolimbic connections which isolate the hippocampal formation from the rest of the neocortex.

Reference-contexts: He removed the hippocampus bilaterally from patient H. M. to cure his epilepsy and unexpectedly created the most famous and most studied subject of amnesia in history. In the meanwhile studies in the cognitive science of memory were independently pursued by researchers such as Miller [Miller, 1956] and Sperling <ref> [Sperling, 1960] </ref>. These researchers concentrated on short term memory, and were influenced by the Ebbinghausian tradition at the methodological level. The predominant approach to long term memory in this era had been the associative interference theory, which emphasized the importance of relatively automatic and passive formation of stimulus-response bonds.

Reference-contexts: Gall commented that "Perception and memory are only attributes common to the fundamental faculties, but not the fundamental faculties themselves" [Gall, 1835]. Spurzheim elaborated Gall's ideas and argued that each mental faculty has a separate memory, relying on observations of within individual variations in memory abilities <ref> [Spurzheim, 1834] </ref>. Next comes the path breaking studies of physicians Broca and Wernicke on the language areas of the brain based on the studies of patients with brain lesions. Although these studies were influential for neuropsychol-ogy in general, they also have relevance as evidence for different faculties of memory.

C. </address>
Reference-contexts: Squire revised Mishkin's model based on the more recent evidence that emphasizes the role of the entorhi-nal and related cortex and de-emphasizes the role of the amygdala <ref> [Squire, 1989] </ref>. The entorhinal cortex is the gateway to the hippocampus, and receives input from all of the perceptual systems. Many of its neurons respond selectively to stimuli in multiple sensory modalities. Thus architecturally it has a unique location that would support combining inputs from various sensory modalities.

Reference-contexts: Thus it is vague on the question of retrograde amnesia. In an experiment by Sutherland and Arnold, rats were trained to find a hidden location in the Morris Water Task <ref> [Sutherland and Arnold, 1987] </ref>. The animals were then kept in their cages for 1, 4, 8 or 12 weeks before producing hippocampal damage in different groups. All groups were tested two weeks after the surgery.

Reference-contexts: This suggests that information acquired during active behavior may be re-expressed in hippocampal circuits during sleep, possibly supporting memory consolidation. It is interesting to note the rapid evolution of the role assigned to the hippocampus in the last half a century <ref> [Swanson, 1983] </ref>. The first hypothesis was the notion that the hippocampus has a primarily olfactory function. It was called the rhinencephalon or "smell brain".

Reference-contexts: Associationist approach was finally taken over by organization theory and related cognitive approaches that highlighted the active and constructive nature of the mnemonic processes after the work of researchers such as Tulving <ref> [Tulving, 1962] </ref> and Mandler [Mandler, 1968]. Until very recently, the cognitive science of memory have been largely developed independent of the neuroscience perspective, and researchers have done little to connect their theories to neural matter.

Reference-contexts: This experiment suggests that hippocam-pus is transiently involved in the memory storage process and that other structures maintain the permanent memories. Recent work by Wilson and McNaughton hints at interesting possibilities for the role of the hippocampus in consolidation <ref> [Wilson and McNaughton, 1994] </ref>. They developed a technique by which they can record simultaneously from about a hundred neurons in a rat hip-pocampus.
