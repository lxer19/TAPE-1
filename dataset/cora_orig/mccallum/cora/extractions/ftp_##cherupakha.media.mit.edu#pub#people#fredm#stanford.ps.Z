Abstract: The LEGO Robot Design Competition at the Mas-sachusetts Institute of Technology is a hands-on, project-based workshop class for undergraduates developed to excite students about robotic technology as they build a competitive autonomous robot of their own design. This paper analyzes two aspects of the technology created for the workshop: the robotic contest specifications and the hardware and software control technology created for the students' use. The goal is to illuminate the iterative process of designing the workshop class, which led to lessons about educational technology, classroom culture, and its impact on students' learning. The results of this work include recommendations about structuring design problems for students, features of educational technology for maximizing students' learning, and thoughts on the role of design in engineering education. Each year since 1991, over one hundred and fifty undergraduates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have participated in the LEGO Robot Design Competition, an experimental workshop class based on the central activity of building a fully functional autonomous robot. This paper focuses specifically on an analysis of the technology created for the workshop, and lessons about effectively structuring materials and problem spaces for students' design work.

Reference-contexts: We did not require students to know soldering skills, circuit design, mechanical design, or a particular programming language in order to be participants. These skills would be learned as needed during the progress of their robotic design work. Borrowing the terminology of Abelson and Sussman <ref> [1] </ref>, I call the level of functionality provided by our control hardware (for example) a layer of abstraction. By this I mean that the control insulates the user from lower-level issues of implementationthe electronic circuit design, for examplerather than suggesting that there is something abstract about the hardware.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, academic design teaching is often predicated on a top-down model of the design process, in which needs are analyzed, constraints are determined, and an optimization process used to guide the solution (see for example <ref> [2] </ref>). While professional designer use these practices, there is growing evidence that this is not the preferred working style for many designers.

Reference-contexts: Donald Schon, the design theorist, studies the work of professional designers from a variety of fields, including engineering. Schon characterizes design as a conversation with the materials of the situation <ref> [7] </ref>: There are more variableskinds of possible moves, norms, and interrelationships of these than can be represented in a finite model. Because of this complexity, the designer's moves tend, happily or unhappily, to produce consequences other than those intended.

Reference-contexts: While professional designer use these practices, there is growing evidence that this is not the preferred working style for many designers. For example, Turkle and Papert <ref> [8] </ref> revive Levi-Strauss' term bricolage to describe a bottom-up method of designing software: While hierarchy and abstraction are valued by the structured programmers' planner's heuristic, bricoleur programmers prefer negotiation and re arrangment of their materials.
