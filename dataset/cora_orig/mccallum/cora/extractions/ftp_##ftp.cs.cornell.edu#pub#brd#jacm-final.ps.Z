Title: Kinodynamic Motion Planning  
Author: Bruce Donald Patrick Xavier John Canny John Reif 
Abstract: Kinodynamic planning attempts to solve a robot motion problem subject to simultaneous kinematic and dynamics constraints. In the general problem, given a robot system, we must find a minimal-time trajectory that goes from a start position and velocity to a goal position and velocity while avoiding obstacles by a safety margin and respecting constraints on velocity and acceleration. We consider the simplified case of a point mass under Newtonian mechanics, together with velocity and acceleration bounds. The point must be flown from a start to a goal, amidst polyhedral obstacles in 2D or 3D. While exact solutions to this problem are not known, we provide the first provably good approximation algorithm, and show that it runs in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The kinodynamic planning problem is to synthesize a robot motion subject to simultaneous kinematic constraints, such as avoiding obstacles, and dynamics constraints, such as 5 An early version of this work appeared as <ref> [CDRX] </ref> 6 This paper describes research done in the Computer Science Robotics Laboratory at Cornell University. Support for our robotics research is provided in part by the National Science Foundation under grants No. IRI-8802390, IRI-9000532 and Presidential Young Investigator award No. <p> They include dynamics laws and bounds on velocity, acceleration, and applied force. Strictly kinodynamic constraints are obstacle-dependent constraints that govern configuration and its time-derivatives but do not fall into either of the previous categories. 7 It was first observed in <ref> [CDRX] </ref> that the methods of Canny and Reif [CR] can be extended to demon strate N P-hardness. For a complete proof see [Xa]. 2 An example of such a constraint is a speed-dependent obstacle-avoidance margin. A con-straint is a kinodynamic constraint if it belongs to one of the above categories.

A con-straint is a kinodynamic constraint if it belongs to one of the above categories. <p> Specifically, neither method necessarily finds a solution that is spatially close to the optimal path, but merely one that has a length (time) that is not too much longer than the optimal length (time). In fact, the results of <ref> [CR] </ref> imply that finding a path that is position-space close to the shortest path, or even one that is homotopic to the optimal is N P-hard. These above results can be extended to a rigid, non-rotating robot whose geometry is given by a union R of convex polyhedra. <p> We provide the first polynomial-time algorithm. The polyhedral Euclidean shortest path problem can be viewed as a version of optimal kinodynamic planning with the acceleration bound a set equal to infinity. This observation may be used to extend the results of <ref> [CR] </ref> to show that in 3D, optimal kinodynamic planning is N P-hard. In other work, O'Dunlaing [O] provides an exact algorithm for one-dimensional kinodynamic planning. These methods may extend to the 2- and 3D cases as well.
