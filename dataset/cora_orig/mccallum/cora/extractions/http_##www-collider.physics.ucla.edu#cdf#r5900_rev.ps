Abstract: We report on results of tests of the 16-channel Hamamatsu R5900-M16 photomultiplier tube for gain uniformity and stability, pixel uniformity, linearity, cross-talk, and quantum efficiency. These parameters are essential to our application; i.e., the read out of signals which are generated by the passage of ionizing particles through the scin

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The development of highly segmented scintillator-based detectors has helped drive the development of fast multianode photomultiplier tubes. The CDF experiment <ref> [1] </ref> is building replacement plug calorimeters which contain scintillating strip detectors at electromagnetic shower maximum. The fine pitch (5 mm) of the shower maximum detector will allow identification of electromagnetic showers and measurement of their spatial positions [2].

Reference-contexts: The CDF experiment [1] is building replacement plug calorimeters which contain scintillating strip detectors at electromagnetic shower maximum. The fine pitch (5 mm) of the shower maximum detector will allow identification of electromagnetic showers and measurement of their spatial positions <ref> [2] </ref>. The shower maximum detector is read out using wavelength shifting (WLS) fibers which are 1 mm in diameter. In total there are 6400 strips to be read out, with limited space available for the photon readout. <p> The tubes were tested in two locations. Most of the tests described here were performed at UCLA. The UCLA test stand was developed originally to test MAPMT's for the CDF plug upgrade <ref> [2] </ref> and for the SDC detector at the SSC [8]. It is shown schematically in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: In total there are 6400 strips to be read out, with limited space available for the photon readout. The possibility of using mul-tianode photomultiplier tubes (MAPMT's) for the photon readout of electromagnetic shower maximum detectors is one we have been investigating for several years <ref> [3] </ref>. The first generation of tubes, such as the Hamamatsu 4135A, are plagued by high channel to channel cross-talk and limited dynamic range [4].

Both tubes use a metal channel plate dynode structure [6], and have greatly improved performance compared to the previous generations of tubes. The cost per channel and the superior channel to channel gain uniformity drove the selection of the R5900-M16 tube as the choice for the photon readout of the CDF shower maximum detector.

Reference-contexts: It is shown schematically in Figure 1. The tube to be tested is mounted within a dark box on a stand on an optical table, and is connected via RG-174 coaxial cables which pass through the dark box wall to 5 LRS 2249 CAMAC ADC modules <ref> [9] </ref>, which are used to digitize the signals. Light signals are delivered to the MAPMT face via a 1 mm diameter plastic optical fiber. This fiber, which is identical to the fibers used in the CDF upgraded plug calorimeter, is a polystyrene core multiclad type manufactured by Kuraray [10].

Reference-contexts: Light signals are delivered to the MAPMT face via a 1 mm diameter plastic optical fiber. This fiber, which is identical to the fibers used in the CDF upgraded plug calorimeter, is a polystyrene core multiclad type manufactured by Kuraray <ref> [10] </ref>. For tests using pulsed light the fiber is illuminated at one end by a green LED with an emission peak of 560 nm. The LED is driven by a 70 ns wide variable-height voltage from a pulse generator, which produces a light pulse with a duration of 100 ns. <p> The relative quantum efficiencies were thus measured using the actual wavelength spectrum expected from the shower maximum detector. The scintillating tile is a square tile of SCSN-38 <ref> [10] </ref>, with an embedded WLS fiber. The waveshifter in the fiber is Y11, at a concentration of 350 ppm, with an emission spectrum peaked at 500 nm. Scintillation light is generated by exposing the tile to an Ru-106 beta emitter.
