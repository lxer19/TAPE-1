Abstract: CSCW (Computer Supported Cooperative Work) is an idea that was demonstrated as early as in the 1960s by Engelbart's pioneering work on the On-Line System (NLS) [Eng75a], which offered computer-supported conferencing. Since that time, a variety of CSCW applications have been developed at several research laboratories and universities. Education is an inherently cooperative activity involving at least one teacher and pupil. 1 In this paper, we connect the two fields together by taking the reader on a tour of CSCW applications and investigating their use in education. It can be argued that these two themes are not distinct. In a broad sense, every CSCW application supports education since any group process involves teaching and learning. However, in this paper, we will use education to refer to a learning and teaching process supported by formal educational institutions such as schools and universities. Our discussion will be based more on hypothesis rather than real experience to allow us to investigate the breadth of CSCW applications, few of which have been used together for education or other purposes. See [Sci87a] for a specific CSCW application designed and used for education. See [Ell91a, Ols90a] for previous surveys on CSCW applications and [Bae93a] for a collection of papers and in-depth commentaries on CSCW applications. To make our discussion concrete, we will give several scenarios based on the example of a graduate operating systems course the author has taught. It is a lab-based course and gives students hands-on experience with designing, implementing, and experimenting with the Xinu operating system [Com84a]. Teaching assistants manage lab sections and help students with their programming assignments. The assignments are designed collaboratively by the professor and teaching assistants. Students can ask the instructors detailed questions during special office hours and short questions whenever the latter are free. Moreover, they can work in groups on some of these assignments. This collaborative task is currently carried out at a single location. In the remaining discussion, we will investigate how CSCW applications could be used to allow it to be carried out at geographically dispersed sites. We assume a new hypothetical course taught at two different universities. The course is managed by one professor, located at one of the universities, and two teaching assistants, one at each university. One of them supervises the Tuesday lab section and the other one supervises the Wednesday lab section. Each of these lab sections has students from both universities who use different physical labs located at their universities to perform their assignments. 333333333333333333333333333333333333

Reference-contexts: The specific CSCW applications we consider are video walls [Abe90a], media space [Har90a], the Liveboard [Elr92a], the Cognoter [Ste87a], the PREP coauthoring system [Neu90a], shared window systems [Lau90a], the FLECSE collaborative software development environment [Dew93a], the GROVE outline editor <ref> [Ell91a] </ref>, the TeleConf audio conferencing system [Rie92a], shared awareness spaces [Dou92a, Man91a], the Information Lens [Mal87a], the Coordinator [Flo88a], computational mail [Bor92a], and a voting tool [Dew93a]. <p> The team members also use Liveboards, Cognoter, and PREP to to produce project reports. In addition, they use the GROVE outline editor <ref> [Ell91a] </ref> to collaboratively refine outlines for these reports. Questions and Answers As in the original course, students and instructors use electronic mail and the telephone to ask and answer questions. In addition, they use TeleConf [Rie92a] to hold audio conferences with the instructors.

Reference-contexts: We show how these applications can be used to facilitate both intra- and inter- site cooperation. The specific CSCW applications we consider are video walls [Abe90a], media space [Har90a], the Liveboard <ref> [Elr92a] </ref>, the Cognoter [Ste87a], the PREP coauthoring system [Neu90a], shared window systems [Lau90a], the FLECSE collaborative software development environment [Dew93a], the GROVE outline editor [Ell91a], the TeleConf audio conferencing system [Rie92a], shared awareness spaces [Dou92a, Man91a], the Information Lens [Mal87a], the Coordinator [Flo88a], computational mail [Bor92a], and a voting tool [Dew93a]. <p> The audio endpoints are speakers and microphones that cover each classroom. Experience at Xerox shows that is is possible to use current technology to establish usable video walls connecting two geographically dispersed sites. The two classrooms are also equipped with Liveboards <ref> [Elr92a] </ref> connected to each other. Liveboards are large pen-based public computer displays controlled by conventional workstations. They can be connected to each other via a network and used in a shared mode. They currently support several applications including the SlideShow and Whiteboard applications.

In our discussion, we assume that each of these applications is cost-effective and works well for the purpose for which it has been designed. <p> In addition, they use the GROVE outline editor [Ell91a] to collaboratively refine outlines for these reports. Questions and Answers As in the original course, students and instructors use electronic mail and the telephone to ask and answer questions. In addition, they use TeleConf <ref> [Rie92a] </ref> to hold audio conferences with the instructors. TeleConf uses the audio capabilities of the participants' workstations to provide computer-controlled conferencing. During office hours of the instructors, the concurrency control method used is moderated floor control.

Reference-contexts: We show how these applications can be used to facilitate both intra- and inter- site cooperation. The specific CSCW applications we consider are video walls [Abe90a], media space [Har90a], the Liveboard [Elr92a], the Cognoter <ref> [Ste87a] </ref>, the PREP coauthoring system [Neu90a], shared window systems [Lau90a], the FLECSE collaborative software development environment [Dew93a], the GROVE outline editor [Ell91a], the TeleConf audio conferencing system [Rie92a], shared awareness spaces [Dou92a, Man91a], the Information Lens [Mal87a], the Coordinator [Flo88a], computational mail [Bor92a], and a voting tool [Dew93a]. <p> In the distributed course, the same process is followed using collaborative applications. The first phase is facilitated using Liveboards and the Cognoter application <ref> [Ste87a] </ref>. The Cog-noter allows users to collaboratively brainstorm, organize, and evaluate ideas for the assignments. In the brainstorming phase, the participants propose various ideas for the assignment; in the organizing phase, they collect related ideas into possible assignments; and in the evaluation phase, they evaluate the different assignments.

Reference-contexts: The importance of computer support for coordination increases as the number of sites increases. Moreover, in our scenario, we maintained the human agents used in the original course. There is considerable interest in inves-tigating how human instructors can be replaced by tutoring software <ref> [Rad92a, Ade92a, Ste92a] </ref>. Again, the role of computer support for shared software increases when software is used for tutoring students, since such support can allow students to collaboratively learn from the software.
