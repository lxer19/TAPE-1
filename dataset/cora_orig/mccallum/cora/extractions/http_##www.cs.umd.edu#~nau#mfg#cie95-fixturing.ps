Abstract: For machined parts, setup time is a major component of the total time required to manufacture a machined part from a stock. If the number of setups and hence setup time can be reduced, this will not only decrease the manufacturing time, but will also ensure better machining accuracy, require fewer work-holding devices and increase machine usage time. To achieve any improvement in setup time, first we need to estimate the setup time accurately. In this paper we propose a methodology to estimate the setup time for machining prismatic parts in a three axis vertical machining center. We concurrently consider three major factors for estimating the number of setups, namely|the precedence constraints among machining operations, the feasibility of work holding using vise clamping, and the availability of datum faces for locating the workpiece on the machine table during machining on a 3 axis vertical machining center.

Reference-contexts: These precedence constraints are shown in More generally, we consider precedence constraints coming from accessibility considerations and from preferred manufacturing practices (such as those enumerated in <ref> [1, 3] </ref>). Here are some examples: 1. If the accessibility volume of a feature f 0 intersects with the removal volume of feature f , then f has to be ma chined before f 0 . 2.

As pointed out by Chang <ref> [2] </ref>, in most approaches for setup planning and fixture design, the two tasks are done sequentially: first a set of machining operations are found which would be machined in a setup and then fixture planning is performed.

Reference-contexts: Precedence Constraints For a given part, the machining operations usually cannot be performed in any arbitrary order [7]. Geometric and technological constraints will require that certain operations be performed before or after other operations. These precedence constraints among machining operations play an important role in setup time estimation. AMPS <ref> [3] </ref> uses heuristic techniques to determine precedence constraints among features. A number of rules based on machining practices have been defined and are used to determine precedence constraints among pairs of features. This approach allows for strict and loose constraints. <p> Setup planning involves determining the various setups in which the part will be machined. While advances have been made in automated fixture design, existing research has mainly focused on designing new fixtures for a given geometry. Chang <ref> [3] </ref> presented comprehensive conditions for holding the workpiece in a vise. These conditions are based on the intermediate workpiece geometry and are sufficient for successfully clamping the workpiece. <p> These precedence constraints are shown in More generally, we consider precedence constraints coming from accessibility considerations and from preferred manufacturing practices (such as those enumerated in <ref> [1, 3] </ref>). Here are some examples: 1. If the accessibility volume of a feature f 0 intersects with the removal volume of feature f , then f has to be ma chined before f 0 . 2.

Fixturability and Setup Planning To ensure successful machining, each intermediate workpiece shape should be fixturable. <p> A primary feature for a given part P and stock S is a machining feature that is minimal with respect to S and maximal with respect to P . Figure 4 shows an example; for a detailed definition the reader is referred to <ref> [6, 8] </ref>. Given a part P and stock S, we will let F denote the set of all primary features for P and S. In [5, 16], we describe an algorithm that, given P and S, will automatically find F .

Reference-contexts: This approach allows for strict and loose constraints. Strict constraints cannot be violated, while loose constraints can| but at a detriment to ensuring good machining practice. The machining features in this approach are allowed to have multiple approach directions and may have conditional precedence constraints. The Machinist system <ref> [10] </ref> is capable of handling the precedences that arise because of setup considerations. In this system, precedences are generated by examining the setup interactions among machining features.

Reference-contexts: If that is not possible we will discard any setup sequence which will require us to machine that workpiece from the given direction. Kanumury et al. gave details about the need and procedure of probing in their article <ref> [11] </ref>. At Step 5c of the procedure Find-Best-Setup-Time described in Section 5.1 we check the workpiece for feasibility of probing it for locating on a machine table. The procedure Workpiece-Probe returns true if it is feasible to probe the workpiece and returns false otherwise.

INTRODUCTION As design activities determine most of the life cycle cost of a product <ref> [18] </ref>, early detection of any production related problem will save time and money in the long run. In particular, if the manufacturability of a part can be estimated early in the design stage, this can help in avoiding costly modifications to design later in the production cycle.

Reference-contexts: In Analyze-Design and several of its subroutines, t s is the setup time required for each setup. In this paper, t s is the setup time for a flat jaw vise, which we take to be 2 minutes <ref> [20] </ref>. After completion of Analyze-Design, T is the minimum setup time over all of the FBMs. <p> Thus, the formula for setup time estimation is given by setup time = n X t si where t si is the time associated with the i th setup. The actual value of t si depends on the part size, weight, geometry and the setup method. Wilson's handbook <ref> [20] </ref> gives data for a variety of setup procedures. We assume that the parts are small in size which can be moved and reoriented manually by one person during the machining process.
