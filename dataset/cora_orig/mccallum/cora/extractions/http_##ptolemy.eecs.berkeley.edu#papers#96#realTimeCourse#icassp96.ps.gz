Abstract: We are developing a sophomore course to serve as a first course in electrical engineering. The course focuses on discrete-time systems. Its goal is to give students an intuitive understanding of concepts such as sinusoids, frequency domain, sampling, aliasing, and quantization. In the laboratory, students build simulations and real-time systems to test these ideas. By using a combination of high-level and DSP assembly languages, the students experiment with a variety of views into the representation, design, and implementation of systems. The students are exposed to a digital style of implementation based on programming both desktop and embedded processors.

In the laboratory, the students leverage their previous laboratories on real-time tone generation to build a system that generates touch tones, i.e., a dual-tone modulated-frequency (DTMF) system <ref> [3, 9] </ref>. We also have them recognize the presence of a '1' digit in real time. The second lecture is on binary frequency shift keying (BFSK) and its use in digital modems. We introduce the issue of matched filtering for this binary case.

After giving examples of sampled data in their daily lives, we introduce sampled signals by way of computer music <ref> [7] </ref>. We begin by discussing sinusoidal models for pure tones. By playing tones, the students hear the effect of changing magnitude, frequency, and phase on individual tones and on a sum of tones. In the next lecture, we present sampling and aliasing.

Pre-requisites We require that the students take an introductory class on programming paradigms <ref> [11] </ref> (which uses Lisp) as well as a C or C++ programming class. This programming background makes it easier for the students to pick up the MAT-LAB language syntax and programming with arrays. The background in C helps them in learning the DSP assembly language.
