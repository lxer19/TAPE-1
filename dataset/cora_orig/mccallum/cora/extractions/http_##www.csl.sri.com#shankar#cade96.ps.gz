Abstract: Decision procedures are increasingly being employed for deciding or simplifying propositional combinations of ground equalities involving uninterpreted function symbols, linear arithmetic, arrays, and other theories. Two approaches for constructing decision procedures for combinations of ground theories were pioneered in the late seventies. In the approach of Nelson and Oppen, decision procedures for two disjoint theories are combined by introducing variables to name subterms and iteratively propagating any deduced equalities between variables from one theory to another. Shostak employs a different approach that works far more efficiently in practice. He uses an optimized implementation of the congruence closure procedure for ground equality over uninterpreted function symbols to combine theories that are canonizable and algebraically solvable. Many useful theories have these properties. Shostak's algorithm is subtle and complex and his description of this procedure is lacking in rigor. We present, for the first time, a careful development and clarification of Shostak's procedure that corrects several mistakes in Shostak's original presentation. Our analysis serves as a useful basis for the implementation, extension, and further optimization of Shostak's decision procedure.

The main efficiency drawback to Nelson-Oppen's approach is that each theory has much of the same notion of equality resulting in duplicated effort. Shostak [18] takes a different approach by restricting his attention to can-onizable and algebraically solvable theories.

Reference-contexts: The Nelson-Oppen procedure is used in Eves [4], the Stanford Pascal Verifier [8], and SDVS [3]. Shostak <ref> [18] </ref> used a different approach that merges the simplifiers for individual theories into a single procedure based on congruence closure. Shostak's decision procedure is at the core of systems such as Ehdm [2] and PVS [13]. <p> In practice, Shostak's procedure is more efficient than that of Nelson and Op-pen (see Crocker [5]). Despite its significance, a rigorous analysis of Shostak's procedure has been lacking. Further, all published accounts of Shostak's method are flawed: the most often-cited paper <ref> [18] </ref> contains two important flaws in the description of the algorithm, while other sources, such as technical reports, contain the same as well as other flaws. <p> The main efficiency drawback to Nelson-Oppen's approach is that each theory has much of the same notion of equality resulting in duplicated effort. Shostak <ref> [18] </ref> takes a different approach by restricting his attention to can-onizable and algebraically solvable theories. A theory is canonizable if there is a canonizer such that for any pure equality a = b is provable in the theory (i.e., ` a = b) if and only if (a) = (b). <p> Shostak shows how real and integer linear arithmetic, the convex theory of lists, and monadic set theory are some examples of canonizable and algebraically solvable theories. Shostak <ref> [18] </ref> also shows how the canonizers and solvers for several pairwise disjoint theories can be combined into a single canonizer and solver for the combined theory. <p> That is, in the purely uninterpreted case f ind returns the canonical representative of a term given the uninterpreted equalites already processed. In the purely interpreted case returns the canonical representative of a term in the terms 3 Much of the theory and notation in this section comes from <ref> [18] </ref> 9 interpreted theory. Shostak's procedure is a method for combining these two canonical forms. <p> The set of equations will have a model iff solve never returns false for a processed equation. Thus whenever an equation is equivalent to false solve must report the contradiction. We now give pseudocode for Shostak's procedure for combining decision procedures <ref> [18] </ref> with the flaws corrected. The main differences with the procedure in Section 3 are that: 10 1. In Sh, Process1 is used to apply Merge to a list of pairs of terms returned by solve. 2. In Process1 , equalities are solved using solve before Merge is invoked. <p> Discrepancies in Shostak's Original Procedure. There are two actual bugs in the pseudocode presented in the paper <ref> [18] </ref>. The most egregious is in the procedure Merge. The condition f ind (u) 6= u should actually be f ind (u) = u. Shostak's 13 earlier technical report [19] does not contain this bug but has other discrepan-cies. <p> Shostak's 13 earlier technical report [19] does not contain this bug but has other discrepan-cies. The second bug is that the output to solve needs to be canonized just in case solve creates new variables and new terms that need to be introduced into the use data structure. Shostak <ref> [18] </ref> states that the use data structure is maintained so that the sig's are unique. This is incorrect and such an "optimization" can result in an incompleteness. The solver for cons, car , and cdr given by Shostak is also buggy. Performance Comparisons.
