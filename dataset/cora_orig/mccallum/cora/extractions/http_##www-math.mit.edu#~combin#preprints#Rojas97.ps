Title: On the Average Number of Real Roots of Certain Random Sparse Polynomial Systems 1  
Author: J. Maurice Rojas 
Date: 00, 19xx  
Note: Lectures in Applied Mathematics Volume  
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to Sueli Rocha do Nascimento. Abstract. We derive an explicit formula for the expected number of real roots of certain random sparse polynomial systems. We propose (and use) a probability measure which is natural in the sense that it is invariant under a natural G-action on the space of roots, where G is a product of orthogonal groups. Our formula arose from an effort (now an ongoing project with J.-P. Dedieu) to generalize the recent condition number theorems of Shub and Smale to sparse polynomial systems and compactifications other than projective space.

Reference-contexts: Main Theorem 1 follows from Main Theorem 2 after partitioning (R fl ) n into orthants and performing a routine multivariable integration. Main Theorem 2, after an algebraic trick, follows from a beautiful integral formula due to Edelman and Kostlan <ref> [EK95] </ref>. Our proofs are detailed in the next section.

Reference-contexts: In particular, lim n!1 n = d 2 . Our example complements another result where all the variances are 1 [EK95]. When d = 1, both of these results merge and we have a randomized version of the generalized eigenvalue problem. (This special case was discovered earlier in <ref> [EKS94] </ref>.) Finally, for our randomized matrix polynomial problem, Corollary 1 implies that the concentration of real eigenpairs is uniform on P n1 R fiP 1 2. Proofs of Our Main Theorems We will first prove Main Theorem 2.

The product of orthogonal groups G := O (n 1 + 1)fi fiO (n k + 1) acts naturally (and isometrically) on X and we thus obtain the following corollary of Main Theorem 2. Corollary 1.

Reference-contexts: Our notion of sparsity is to specify supports. This idea is natural in the sense that if one specifies the support of a polynomial then one can omit as many monomial terms as one likes. It is also important to note that our ap proach complements that of Khovanskii <ref> [Kho91] </ref>, who has found amazing results and conjectures in terms of solely the number of monomial terms in a polynomial. Remark 2. Working with Newton polytopes is already more precise than working with total degree.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction One may wonder if the recent advances in toric variety techniques, e.g., convex geometric formulae for the number of complex roots of a polynomial system [Ber75, LW96, RW96, HS96, Roj96], can be used to refine Shub and Smale's recent work <ref> [SS2] </ref> on the number of real roots of a random polynomial system. We answer this question in the affirmative for a particular family of sparse polynomial systems and formulate a conjectural answer for more general sparse systems. <p> Then for E as in Main Theorem 1, M L (E) = Vol L (P ). Remark 8. Note that the k = 1 portion of the standard case yields a special case of the following formula due to Shub and Smale <ref> [SS2] </ref>: N (E) = p Q d i when L = Z n and, for all i, the Newton polytope of f i is the standard n-simplex uniformly scaled by a factor of d i . <p> Main Theorem 1 thus complements their result. (That our distribution specializes to theirs is very easy to verify.) Convex geometry was not mentioned in <ref> [SS2] </ref>, so it is even more of a coincidence that N (E) = p the multilinearity of M L ()) in the case they considered. <p> Remark 10. One can in fact derive the above corollary without resorting to Main Theorem 2. Shub and Smale did this for the case described in Remark 8 and this was how they derived their O (n+1)-invariant measure <ref> [SS2] </ref>. For more general E it is somewhat unclear if any sort of natural group in-variance can be maintained. However, following the notation of Remarks 4 and 5, the generalization where one replaces ffi j by d ij 2 N preserves G-invariance and is currently under investigation. <p> This is ongoing work with J.-P.

Reference-contexts: It then becomes clear that exp B : (R fl ) n ! Z has exactly 2 even (B) analytic inverses, and these inverses differ only by coordinate reflections. Remark 14. Techniques of this sort are developed further in <ref> [Stu91, PS94, IR95] </ref> in connection with a conjectural combinatorial upper bound on the number of isolated roots in (R fl ) n of a general non-random sparse polynomial system. The underlying framework is the theory of toric varieties and some excellent references for this theory are [KKMS73, Oda88, Ful93].

Reference-contexts: Note also that the power of disappears iff there is at most one odd n j . Remark 7. Let M (E) denote the (unnormalized) n-dimensional mixed volume <ref> [Ber75, Oda88, Roj94, DGH96, VGC96, EC95] </ref> of the convex hulls of the E i . Then it easily follows from the results of [Ber75] that for general E, the expected number of roots of F in (C fl ) n is exactly M (E) [Roj94].
