Reference-contexts: Aliasing errors arise if interpolant sample rays intersect different objects, or miss specular highlights, or differ by greater than * relative error etc. More details are available on how to detect and handle aliasing problems in <ref> [1] </ref>. When the ray tracer builds interpolants it tests that each of the 16 sample rays satisfies all the aliasing tests.
