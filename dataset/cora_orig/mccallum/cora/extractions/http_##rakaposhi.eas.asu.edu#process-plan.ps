Abstract: Process planning involves producing machining plans for manufacturing mechanical parts. It requires satisfying a variety of hard and soft geometric, kinematic, tolerance based and economic constraints. Most existing approaches to automating process planning involve doing a global search for a process plan that is optimal with respect to a pre-specified objective function. Such approaches suffer from two important limitations. First, the search space for process plans is too large to facilitate an efficient systematic search. Second and perhaps more important, the evaluation metrics for process plans are very much context dependent, and it is rarely the case that an accurate optimality metric is available a priori. To overcome these limitations, in this paper we propose an iterative framework that continuously searches for a better plan based on interaction with the user. The search is modeled as hill-climbing with the objective function changing as a result of interaction. We will discuss how the approch can be implemented within ASUFTB, a modern feature-based manufacturing system. fl Batchu (batchu@asu.edu) and Kambhampati (rao@asu.edu) are with Computer Science department, Hirode (hirode@enuxsa.eas.asu.edu) and Shah (jshah@asuvax.eas.asu.edu) are with Mechanical Engineering department.

Reference-contexts: how does the planner decide which part of the plan to modify? (iii) what is the space of modifications that is allowed? and (iv) how are the modifications carried out? In the rest of this paper, we will address these issues in the context of the ASU Feature Testbed (ASUFTB) <ref> [4] </ref>, a feature based 1 on the current optimality criteria. Apply the most promising of these repairs and show it to user. If the user is not satisfied with the current plan he would criticize it and his criticism is incorporated into the current plan. <p> There may be more than one way to perform this mapping, thus there can be more than one machining plan. 4 The ASU features test bed (ASUFTB) Shah et al. have developed a system called ASUFTB <ref> [4] </ref> which systematically enumerates alternative features and machining interpretations for an object and these interpretations can 3 right they are represented in a tree form be used to systematically enumerate all candidate machining plans. Some of the characteristics of ASUFTB which are useful to our discussion are listed below. 1. <p> In Figure 3, R is represented by means of dotted lines. This R is decomposed into minimum convex cells, called atomic cells (Figure 3) using a method called halfspace partitioning <ref> [4] </ref>. A plane cuts the space into two half spaces. Half space can thus be fully characterized with a plane and a direction associated with its normal.
