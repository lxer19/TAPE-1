Abstract: This talk is intended to give a survey on the existing literature on the decoding of algebraic-geometric codes. Although the motivation originally was to find an efficient decoding algorithm for algebraic-geometric codes, the latest results give algorithms which can be explained purely in terms of linear algebra. We will treat the following subjects: 1. The decoding problem

Reference-contexts: This line of reasoning for BCH codes was done for the first time by Peterson [43] in 1960 and independently by Arimoto <ref> [1] </ref> in 1961. Later improvements were found on the minimum distance of cyclic codes, known as the Hartmann-Tzeng, Roos and van Lint-Wilson bounds, see [35].

Reference-contexts: Then (A; B) is a t-error correcting pair for (l; h). Another way to decode these classical Goppa codes is by means of solving the so called key equation with Euclid's algorithm or the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm <ref> [2, 36] </ref> in the ring of polynomials F q e [X]. We return to that in section 5. <p> The sequence of solutions in the Euclidean algorihm is replaced by an algorithm giving the so called subresultant sequence, see Porter [44] and Shen [51, 54]. 18 6 Improvements of the complexity It is not before one has decoding algorithms as fast as Euclid's algorithm or the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm <ref> [2, 36] </ref> solving the key equation, that AG codes will be implemented for practical purposes. For polynomials in one variable division with rest gives Euclid's algorithm. Buch-berger's algorithm [6] computing Grobner bases is a generalization of this to polynomials in several variables.

Reference-contexts: So one considers minimum distance decoding with preprocessing (MDDP), but also this problem turns out to be hard, see Bruck and Naor <ref> [5] </ref>. If C is a linear code of minimum distance d and y a word of distance at most b (d 1)=2c to C, then the nearest codeword is unique.

Reference-contexts: There are some introductory works on the subject, see [24, 32, 33, 34].

Reference-contexts: The coset decoding is done in several steps where the dimension of the subcode drops by one in every step. The whole setup is also used by Feng and Rao in another paper <ref> [17] </ref> to get an improved lower bound on the minimum distance of AG codes in case the redundancy is between g and 2g. Furthermore it can be explained in terms of linear algebra only as we will do in the following. <p> Theorem 4.4 If a code has a t-error correcting array, then it has a decoding algorithm of complexity O (n 3 ) which corrects t errors.

Reference-contexts: Sakata [47, 48] gave a generalization of the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm to several variables. Using Sakata's ideas Justesen, Larsen, Elbrond Jensen and Hoholdt [27] could improve the complexity of their algorithm for codes on plane curves from O (n 3 ) to O (n 7=3 ).

[27] following Sakata, Shen [53, 54] obtained the same complexity for codes on Hermitian curves using Porter's algorithm.

Reference-contexts: the invention of Goppa of AG codes and the work of Tsfasman, Vladut and Zink [60], who proved that there exists curves over finite fields with many points, giving asymptotically good codes, at the beginning of the eighties, it took some time before Justesen, Larsen, Elbrond Jensen, Havemose and Hoholdt <ref> [26] </ref> found at the end of the eighties a generalization of Peterson's algorithm for AG codes on plane curves. This 11 was generalized to arbitrary curves by Skorobogatov and Vladut [55]. Independently Krachkovskii proved the same result, but his work was only published as a preprint in Russian [30]. <p> With the modified algorithm (d fl 1)=2 s errors can be decoded <ref> [26, 28, 9] </ref>, where s is the so called Clifford defect, see Duursma [9].

The thesis of Porter contained some mistakes but these were corrected in [45].

Reference-contexts: There are some introductory works on the subject, see [24, 32, 33, 34]. For a selfcontained treatment on algebraic curves over finite fields we recommend the first chapters of the books of Chevalley [8] or Moreno <ref> [38] </ref>. This suffices to understand the papers concerning the decoding of algebraic-geometric codes. For a more thourough treatment of algebraic curves and their codes we mention the book of Tsfasman and Vladut [59] and the forthcomming book of Stichtenoth [57].

Reference-contexts: Feng, Rao and Duursma gave another solution to the problem of finding an efficient explicit algorithm which decodes up to half the designed minimum distance. Their work on majority coset decoding is treated in the next section. Any linear code is representable by means of a curve, see <ref> [42] </ref>. This is a nice mathematical result, but from a pratical coding point of view it puts matters upside down. If we want to construct good codes we have gained nothing by this knowledge.

Reference-contexts: This line of reasoning for BCH codes was done for the first time by Peterson <ref> [43] </ref> in 1960 and independently by Arimoto [1] in 1961.

Reference-contexts: The restriction that the number of points on the curve is greater than n remains. 5 Decoding algebraic-geometric codes by solving the key equation Around the same time as Justesen et al. [26], Porter <ref> [44] </ref> found another decoding algorithm, which is a generalization of solving the key equation of classical Goppa codes by Euclid's algorithm in the ring of polynomials in one variable.

Reference-contexts: The thesis of Porter contained some mistakes but these were corrected in <ref> [45] </ref>. Ehrhard [13, 14] also showed that the results of Porter are correct, moreover he proved the equivalence of the modified algorithm and the decoding by solving the key equation.

Reference-contexts: It is a counting argument to show that certain divisors exist, but in order to find these divisors explicitly one has to know quite a lot about the Jacobian and not much is known for this purpose. Rotillon and Thiong Ly <ref> [46] </ref> considered the problem of finding these divisors for the Klein quartic, and Le Brigand [31] for hyperelliptic curves. Carbonne and Thiong Ly [7] found for some curves the minimal u such that the above procedure works. First Ehrhard [13] considered divisors F i of the form lP j .
