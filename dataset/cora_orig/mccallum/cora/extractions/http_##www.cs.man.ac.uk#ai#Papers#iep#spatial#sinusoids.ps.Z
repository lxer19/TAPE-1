Abstract: This paper investigates the use of the sinusoidal transform to represent convex regions of the plane. Formulae are derived for the determination of various geometrical features and relations in terms of sinusoidal transforms and their Fourier descriptors. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a periodic function to be the sinusoidal transform of a convex region are derived. Sinusoidal Fourier descriptors are shown to compare favourably with other shape-representation schemes based on Fourier descriptors.

Reference-contexts: For example, Zahn and Roskies [11] investigate the boundary function OE fl (s) which gives (a normalized version of) the tangent angle at any point of the contour as a function of the normalized arc-length to that point from a fixed starting point. Granlund <ref> [2] </ref>, Persoon and Fu [6] and Lin and Hwang [4] consider instead the boundary functions X (s) and Y (s) giving the Cartesian coordinates of any point of the contour as a function of the normalized arc-length to that point from a fixed starting point. <p> Moreover, it is unclear that geometrical features can be as simply extracted from this boundary function as is the case for the sinusoidal transform; and the characterization of the class of periodic functions representing simple, closed curves (i.e. curves enclosing well-defined regions) is not given. Granlund <ref> [2] </ref> considers instead the boundary functions X (s) and Y (s) giving the Cartesian coordinates of any point of the contour as a function of the normalized arc-length to that point from a fixed starting point.

Reference-contexts: And Kiryati and Maydan <ref> [3] </ref> analyse the boundary function r (OE) such that (r (OE); OE) are the polar coordinates of the contour points relative to an origin within the region. <p> We suggest that the sinusoidal transform compares favourably in this respect with other representation schemes based on Fourier descriptors in the literature. For example, Kiryati and Maydan <ref> [3] </ref> derive comparable formulae based on the Fourier descriptors of the polar representation function, including expressions for the centroid of a region. However, the polar scheme suffers from serious drawbacks. For one thing, the expressions concerning perimeter length are much less satisfactory than their sinusoidal counterparts.

Reference-contexts: This method of representing convex regions is essentially equivalent to the `rotating callipers' method (Toussaint [9]) and to the well-studied and widely-applied Hough- and Radon transforms (see, for example, Leavers <ref> [5] </ref>). According to this method, a convex region of the plane can be represented by rotating it around the origin and plotting the height (the y-coordinate) of its highest and lowest points over time. Figure 1 shows some convex regions of the plane and their corresponding representations.

Reference-contexts: Exactly which geometric features of regions can be read off from their representations in terms of Fourier coefficients depends on the type of boundary function used. In this paper, we investigate what happens when we take the boundary function to be the sinusoidal transform (Pratt <ref> [7] </ref>). This method of representing convex regions is essentially equivalent to the `rotating callipers' method (Toussaint [9]) and to the well-studied and widely-applied Hough- and Radon transforms (see, for example, Leavers [5]).

Reference-contexts: Geometrically, if we imagine S and T rotating together about the origin, the crossing points occur at times when their corresponding lines of support are horizontal.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 shows some convex regions of the plane and their corresponding representations. Spatial representation schemes based on similar geometrical ideas have also been proposed as models of spatial representation in animal brains (Touretzky, Redish and Wan <ref> [10] </ref>). However, our concern in this paper is not to apply, or even to recommend, the sinusoidal transform, but rather, to establish its properties. The plan of the paper is as follows. We begin by introducing the sinusoidal transform, explaining its most basic properties.
