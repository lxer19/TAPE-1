Title: Evolving nonTrivial Behaviors on Real Robots: an Autonomous Robot that Picks up Objects

Abstract: Recently, a new approach that involves a form of simulated evolution has been proposed for the building of autonomous robots. However, it is still not clear if this approach may be adequate to face real life problems. In this paper we show how control systems that perform a nontrivial sequence of behaviors can be obtained with this methodology by carefully designing the conditions in which the evolutionary process operates. In the experiment described in the paper, a mobile robot is trained to locate, recognize, and grasp a target object. The controller of the robot has been evolved in simulation and then downloaded and tested on the real robot.

Reference-contexts: In all of the work described neural networks were used in order to implement the controller with the exception of Colombetti and Dorigo <ref> (Colombetti and Dorigo, 1992) </ref> who used a classifier system. This work clearly shows that evolutionary robotics is a very active and promising new field of research. However, it is also clear that real life problems require system able to produce behaviors significantly more complex than those described above.

The obtained control system was then downloaded on the robot and tested in the real environment. In this section we will describe the robot, the environment of the robot, and the simulator. <p> Given this successful performance it did not seemed necessary to continue the evolutionary process in the real environment in order to allow individuals to adapt to the differences between the simulated and the real environment, as we did in our previous work <ref> (see Nolfi, Floreano, Miglino, and Mondada, 1994) </ref>. 6 Discussion We were able to evolve neural controllers for a Khepera robot that can perform a relatively complex task.

Reference-contexts: Evolutionary Robotics approaches are based on the genetic algorithm technique <ref> (Holland, 1975) </ref>. An initial population of different "genotypes" each codifying the control system (and possibly the morphology) of a robot are created randomly.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Work in Artificial Life <ref> (see Langton, 1989) </ref> has introduced new techniques for developing creatures living and behaving in a variety of environments. More recently, there have been several attempts to apply Artificial Life techniques to the design of mobile robots.

Reference-contexts: When the evolutionary process was conducted partially or totally on the real robot in some cases the evaluation process was conducted automatically, i.e., without requiring an external support (Floreano and Mondada, 1994; Nolfi, Floreano, Miglino, and Mondada, 1994) while in other cases performance were evaluated by human observers <ref> (Lewis, Fagg and Sodium, 1992) </ref>. In all of the work described neural networks were used in order to implement the controller with the exception of Colombetti and Dorigo (Colombetti and Dorigo, 1992) who used a classifier system.
