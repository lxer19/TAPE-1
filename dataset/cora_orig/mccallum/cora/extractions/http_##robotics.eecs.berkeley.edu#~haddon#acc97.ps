Title: Evaluation of AHS Throughput Using SmartCap  
Author: John A. Haddon 
Address: Berkeley, California 94720  
Affiliation: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences University of California at Berkeley  
Abstract: This paper presents a method for analysis of automated highway throughput for AHS designs, including those with platooning. Simulation results are presented which show that increased information leads to higher throughput, and that a platooning design will have higher throughput than any individual vehicle design.

Reference-contexts: In many cases, this will simply be the product of the space with the simulation time step (typically 20s), but, in some cases, the space that an activity requires varies with time. (For detailed calculations of spacetime for various activities, see <ref> [1] </ref>.) Working upstream, SmartCap calculates the space-time made available by vehicles from the previous section, how many vehicles from the previous section may move into the current section, and then the velocity in the previous section. For more details on the SmartCap model, see [2] and [3].

Reference-contexts: This concept is designated IVRRA, for Individual Vehicle, Range, Rate and Acceleration information. 2.2. Platooning It has been suggested (see <ref> [4] </ref>) that great throughput benefits can be achieved by having groups of cars (called platoons) drive extremely close together (with only 1-2m between vehicles), with large distances separating platoons.

Reference-contexts: Although the difference between the individual vehicle concepts are relatively minor, it is clear that with a higher level of information, the throughput can also be increased. Currently, the design requires that only free agents (single car platoons) can change lanes. It has recently been suggested <ref> [5] </ref> that relaxing this assumption may lead to an increase in both safety and throughput. The proposed design would allow cars to change lanes onto the end of a platoon.
