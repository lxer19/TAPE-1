Abstract: In this paper we describe an interactive symbolic-numeric interface framework (editor) to the ELLPACK partial differential equation (PDE) system for building PDE solvers for a much broader range of applications. The domain of applicability of ELLPACK and its parallel version (//ELLPACK) is restricted to second order linear elliptic boundary value problems. This editor allows the specification of nonlinear initial and boundary value PDE problems. The editor applies hybrid symbolic-numeric techniques at the PDE problem level to automatically reduce them to a sequence of linear elliptic PDEs. The result of this preprocessing is recorded in the form of an ELLPACK program. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the functionality and applicability of this interface framework, and the efficiency of the underlying solution methods.

Reference-contexts: Another problem is the inability of computer algebra systems to generate and manipulate numeric code conveniently is another difficulty. This problem is partially handled by code generation systems such as GENCRAY and GEN-TRAN <ref> (Gates, 1986) </ref>, but more work needs to be done to allow convenient manipulation of numeric code inside computer algebra systems.

Reference-contexts: Even though the //ELLPACK control program is in a very high level language, it is quite long in typical applications, of the order of several hundred lines. The resulting Fortran control program is much longer still.

Reference-contexts: The solvers are built out of an extensive library of modules that correspond to the various phases of the numerical processes for these types of PDE problems. A detailed description of the ELLPACK system for sequential machines is given in <ref> (Rice and Boisvert, 1985) </ref>. The system is currently being extended to accommodate PDE problems which may be nonlinear, second order in space and parabolic or hyperbolic in time. The extension also includes facilities to specify or select pairs of parallel algorithms and architectures. <p> The //ELLPACK system already has a natural interface to MAXIMA and //ELLPACK and now implements two of the most often used nonlinear approaches, the Picard and Newton's iterations. Their formulation at the PDE problem level has appeared in <ref> (Rice and Boisvert, 1985) </ref>. For completeness, we present it here. 2.1.1.
