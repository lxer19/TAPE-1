Reference-contexts: Normative decision theory states that the sequence of actions which maximizes the overall utility is the one that should be chosen. These techniques have been used in many real-life planning situations including managing quality of computing services [60], siting waste facilities [69], energy system development [73], and many others <ref> [1, 10] </ref>. Decision theory provides many techniques for the elicitation of single-attribute utilities and attribute weights for multiattribute decision models.

Reference-contexts: Research is also underway to develop metalevel knowledge acquisition tools, tools that will generate knowledge acquisition tools for a particular application domain [46, 56]. An interesting recent knowledge acquisition technique exploits the use of knowledge maintenance <ref> [7] </ref>. De-flned broadly, knowledge maintenance is the addition, deletion, or modiflcation of knowledge in the knowledge base. <p> mention the key idea provided by the technique toward my proposed preference acquisition technique. 2.2.1 Ripple Down Rules Ripple down rules is a knowledge acquisition technique based on knowledge maintenance which adds or modifles a rule in the knowledge base whenever the expert system makes an inadequate or incorrect recommendation <ref> [7] </ref>. A key philosophical idea underlying the system is that experts never provide knowledge about how they reach a particular judgment, instead they provide a justiflcation of why the judgment is correct, and this justiflcation usually depends on the context of the case.

Reference-contexts: Three-dimensional (3-D) displays of dose distributions are di-cult to interpret and 3-D dose distributions have led to data overload [45]. To help combat this data overload, radiation physicists have developed ways of summarizing the dose display in the form of dose-volume histograms (DVH) <ref> [11] </ref>, and radiation biologists have developed quantitative models which use the DVH to compute the Tumor Control Probability (TCP) for target volumes [21] and the Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP) for normal tissues [39].

Reference-contexts: Multiattribute weight elicitation techniques include ranking, direct rating, ratio estimation, and swing weights which require numerical estimation [14], cross-attribute indifierence and cross-attribute strength of preference which require indifierence or strength of preference judgments comparing at least two attributes <ref> [13, 38] </ref>, and analytic hierarchy process which requires pairwise strength of preference judgments [62]. Clinical decision analysis has been well-studied and has been shown to handle efiectively the problems faced in routine medical decision making [35, 50, 68, 75]. <p> This is inconsistent because it implies that issue i is more important than issue i c which is not true since issue i c is the most critical issue. The methodology described above is a variant of the trade-ofi technique or the cross-attribute indifierence technique for constructing attribute weights <ref> [13, 38] </ref>. This methodology can be applied to difierent patient categories. As in the case of the utility functions, I will use the same three tumor sites, and will elicit the weights from the radiation oncologists from whom I will elicit utility functions.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, preference acquisition is performed by identifying the objectives of the decision, structuring the decision problem, and eliciting the desirability of the various outcomes <ref> [16] </ref>. The main problem with preference acquisition is that it asks the decision maker to consider hypothetical situations which may never occur in practice, making it very hard for the decision maker to express a true preference.

Compared to knowledge acquisition, fewer researchers are working on preference acquisition. Thus there are many classes of decision-support systems for which e-cient and accurate preference acquisition techniques have not been developed. <p> be updated whenever the recommendation of the decision-support system does not agree with the recommendation of the decision maker. 2.2.2 Simulated Decision Scenarios Simulated decision scenarios is a preference acquisition technique which infers the preference model of the decision maker based on the decisions made by him/her on simulated decisions <ref> [18] </ref>. This technique applies to the class of decision-support systems which have a preference model and an environmental or process model which predicts the outcome of a decision alternative. The method comprises of three phases.

Reference-contexts: To highlight the importance of the problem, Feigenbaum coined the phrase knowledge acquisition bottleneck, an expression that has now become cliche <ref> [19] </ref>. Traditionally, knowledge acquisition is performed by direct questioning of the expert, by interpretation of verbal protocols created by asking an expert to think aloud while working on real or simulated problems, by ethnographic methods which involves observing the expert directly in the workplace, and other methods [22].

The issue associated with each target volume was treatment failure. In order to obtain its probability, I used the TCP model by Goitein <ref> [21] </ref>, which computes the probability that the tumor is eradicated. The issue associated with each of the normal tissues appearing in the treatment fleld was the occurrence of a radiation-induced clinical complication.

In a recent review article, Musen has identifled some of the causes of the knowledge acquisition bottleneck [47]. The flrst reason is that the knowledge that experts use has become tacit. Due to repeated practice, they can perform actions without being aware of the knowledge they are using.

Reference-contexts: For such non-trivial decision problems, it is di-cult to assign a single utility to each outcome; so an outcome is divided into a number of meaningful component attributes which contribute to the overall utility of the outcome. The resulting model is called a multiattribute decision model <ref> [36, 74] </ref>. The utility of each component attribute is assessed as in the single-attribute case. The decision maker's preferences are obtained in terms of attributes weights which signify the trade-ofis that he is willing to make among these attributes. <p> Standard gamble based techniques, such as variable probability method and variable certainty equivalent which require indifierence between a gamble and a sure outcome, are used to elicit the utility of outcomes in decision problems involving uncertainty <ref> [36, 59] </ref>. <p> I will use proxy attributes in order to elicit the utility functions. A proxy attribute is one that reects the degree to which an associated objective is met but does not directly measure the objective <ref> [36] </ref>. The proxy attribute will be the probability of a bad outcome for the issue. This probability will come from TCP and NTCP models which compute the tumor control probability or the normal tissue complication probability based on the dose distribution in and other radiobiological characteristics of the tissue. <p> However it is appropriate in this case as it matches the objective for the issue which is to minimize the chance of a bad outcome. Also instances of such attributes have been used by Keeney and Raifia <ref> [36] </ref> where they use the probability of death as a possible attribute in a hypothetical medical decision problem (pp. 40, 53-55). The utility function will be described in more detail in the Section 4.1. Difierent issues have difierent levels of morbidity. <p> I have presented an intuitive development of the multiplicative multiattribute model. I will now relate this model to the theoretical multiplicative multiattribute model as described in the standard textbooks <ref> [36, 74] </ref>. The standard multiplicative model is expressed as: 1 + wF = i=1 where the model has n attributes, F is the aggregate utility, u i is the utility of attribute i, w i is its weight (0 w i 1) and w is the interaction parameter.

The weight indicated the clinical relevance of an issue. A weight of 0 meant the issue was irrelevant, and 1 meant it was important.

Reference-contexts: In a recent review article, Musen has identifled some of the causes of the knowledge acquisition bottleneck <ref> [47] </ref>. The flrst reason is that the knowledge that experts use has become tacit. Due to repeated practice, they can perform actions without being aware of the knowledge they are using.

Reference-contexts: Finally, because 3-D planning is not constrained to using radiotherapy beam arrangements that adhere to a co-planar geometry about the transverse patient axis, there is a much larger number of possible solutions to the planning problem. Consequently, the issue of plan optimization has gained renewed interest <ref> [20,43, 49] </ref>. Ideally the 3-D planning system should be able to optimize the treatment plan automatically, or at least semi-automatically, with user guidance. To do this, the computer must calculate a large number of difierent plans, compare them, and determine which is the best.

Reference-contexts: The goal of radiation treatment is to irradiate uniformly all target volumes to their prescribed doses, and at the same time, to minimize radiation induced damage to the nearby healthy normal tissues <ref> [51] </ref>. Treatment planning then involves designing a set of beams which satisfy the treatment goal as closely as possible. The ideal treatment plan would deliver all of the prescribed dose to the target volumes while simultaneously delivering little or no radiation to the adjacent normal tissues.
