Reference-contexts: If the mobile client has a limited energy source (e.g. standard battery cells), energy is a very precious resource and needs to be conserved <ref> [2, 14] </ref>. In the scenario just described, suppose the clients know the sequence of data items. If, in addition, the length of the data items were fixed, the variance of the rotation length would be zero and the mean rotational latency would be reduced to R=2.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The delivery of data over wireless media is rapidly becoming an important and expanding application area. It seems likely that the use of various wireless media, such as paging, FM subcarrier, cellular data, and PCS wireless networks <ref> [3] </ref>, will continue to increase for delivery of a wide variety of data applications. Applications in the realm of personal information services, such as the delivery of periodically updated news, weather, stock, traffic, and sports information to mobile users, appear to be poised for explosive growth and widespread proliferation.

Reference-contexts: FM subcarrier communication can potentially provide higher bandwidth and full-duplex communication, although currently most systems are used in low-bandwidth simplex mode. Cellular data communication typically provides full-duplex communication, with a low to moderate bandwidth. PCS systems such as Bellcore's WACS <ref> [4] </ref> typically provide full-duplex services and data rates up to around 32 kbps. We omit further details of the architecture of the server and of the communication network. Each broadcast period consists of a preamble, a pattern of zero or more bits known to the clients and used for synchronization. <p> Consider a system in which transmissions to clients are divided into time slots. For example, in Bellcore's WACS proposal <ref> [4] </ref> for a PCS system, transmissions to clients are divided into time slots, with eight time slots per 2.5 msec frame; each time slot is nominally capable of carrying user data at the rate of 32 kbps.

Reference-contexts: Thus the server may change the data layout in response to the pattern of data writes by the information provider. (This is in contrast to the situation considered in previous work <ref> [14, 5] </ref> where the data layout is changed in response to the pattern of data reads by the clients; we will consider this in the next section also.) For example, if a data item is changing rapidly the server may write it multiple times during a single rotation. 4 Changing data <p> In that case, it may be possible to improve the performance of the airdisk system by exploiting this client interest information. For example, it is likely that some items will be more popular (i.e., of interest to more clients) than others. Imielinski et al [14] and Chiueh <ref> [5] </ref> have referred to these popular items as hot spots, by analogy with hot spots in magnetic disks, and Chiueh has essentially proposed replicating hot spots on each airdisk rotation in order to minimize the mean access time. <p> We first consider the situation in which there is no index on the airdisk (as assumed in <ref> [5] </ref>), and then consider the situation where there is an index (as assumed in [14].) Note that in the first situation client energy consumption may be high since the client has to read the airdisk all the time, while in the second situation more wireless bandwidth is consumed for the index.

Reference-contexts: For magnetic disks such operations are sometimes carried out in order to overcome the I/O performance bottleneck presented by magnetic disks in parallel computing. For example, del Rosario et al <ref> [6] </ref> describe compiler techniques to detect different data access patterns in different phases of a parallel program; they then show how changing the data layout between two phases of a parallel program can significantly improve overall performance.

Reference-contexts: Given a graph G = (V; E) with vertex set V and edges E, find a one-to-one function f : V ! f1; 2; :::; jV jg such that X max (f (u); f (v)) is minimized. The proof is omitted here for brevity; it is given in <ref> [8] </ref>. 2 Note that for the special case where every client is only interested in one item on every rotation, data layout problem 2 can be solved trivially by ordering the items in descending order of popularity, i.e., items with the most client interest first. <p> This paper describes work which is in progress. Several issues have been related to airdisks and airRAID which deserve further study and which we are currently pursuing <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We use airdisk access time as a measure of performance. (We also briefly discuss issues of energy consumption at the mobile client.) We model two problems of determining the optimal broadcast scheduling (i.e., airdisk data layout) in graph-theoretical terms and show that they are NP-complete <ref> [10] </ref>, i.e., computationally intractable. We are currently investigating sub-optimal heuristics for these problems. In sec. 5 we consider the problem of obtaining information about data access patterns in a wireless mobile environment, and discuss several alternative solutions.

Reference-contexts: We use the airdisk model to borrow the solution to this problem used for magnetic disks, i.e., to improve performance via parallelism while maintaining availability via redundancy, as in the Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) approach <ref> [13, 11] </ref> which is in successful and widespread use.

A magnetic disk consists of a set of circular platters, each of which rotates under a read/write head which can move radially across the platter surface. Typically, only a single platter can be read or written at a time. The platter is divided radially into sectors. <p> Magnetic disk arrays have been proposed since the 1980s as a way of using multiple magnetic disks operating in parallel to improve aggregate I/O performance of computer systems <ref> [13, 11] </ref>. Disk array systems, commonly known as Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID), are now offered in the product lines of most major computer manufacturers, and have enjoyed tremendous commercial success and applicability in high-performance workstations and supercomputers.

Reference-contexts: The mean rotational latency for a client accessing a given data item from such an airdisk, if the airdisk has mean rotation length R and variance s, is R + 2R proof. The proof follows directly from the "residual life paradox" described in Kleinrock <ref> [12] </ref>. We sketch the underlying intuition here. Assume that a client begins reading the airdisk at at an arbitrary point of time, and is interested in item x. On average, item x will appear every R seconds. <p> Thus the mean rotational latency experienced by the client will be more than R=2. (For the derivation of the formula, see <ref> [12] </ref>.) Note that only if all the items were of the same length, and the rotation length were R for every rotation (i.e., zero variance), would the mean latency be R=2. 2 The mean rotational latency affects not only the access time experienced by the user, but also affects the energy

Reference-contexts: A significant amount of attention has been paid to the development of wireless data protocols for the various wireless communication media mentioned above. Recently, Imielinski et al <ref> [14] </ref> have considered the problem of retrieving data using an index, as is commonly done for magnetic disks, where both the data and the index are broadcast periodically over a wireless medium. <p> It might seem that the average rotational latency for a client which is reading data from the disk is R=2, and in fact this value has sometimes been used in previous work on periodic wireless data broadcast <ref> [14] </ref>. However, it can be shown that mean rotational latency depends not only upon the mean rotation length but also on its variance. <p> If the mobile client has a limited energy source (e.g. standard battery cells), energy is a very precious resource and needs to be conserved <ref> [2, 14] </ref>. In the scenario just described, suppose the clients know the sequence of data items. If, in addition, the length of the data items were fixed, the variance of the rotation length would be zero and the mean rotational latency would be reduced to R=2. <p> Thus the server may change the data layout in response to the pattern of data writes by the information provider.

Reference-contexts: If an uplink channel exists it is shared amongst the clients by means of ALOHA or Ethernet-type contention protocols, or using TDMA, FDMA, or CDMA multiplexing <ref> [15] </ref>. The clients can use the uplink channel to send read or write requests to the server. The server responds to read and write requests by modifying the stream of data items sent in subsequent broadcast periods. <p> Thus the server cannot know which clients received the information correctly and which did not. The server inserts forward error correction <ref> [15] </ref> encoding into the data written onto the airdisk, and typically periodically re-broadcasts the data even if it has not been updated by the information provider. The architecture and details of the communications system depend upon the technology used.
