Abstract: We present a new global optimization approach for solving exactly or inexactly constrained distance geometry problems. Distance geometry problems are concerned with determining spatial structures from measurements of internal distances. They arise in the structural interpretation of nuclear magnetic resonance data and in the prediction of protein structure. These problems can be naturally formulated as global optimization problems which generally are large and difficult. The global optimization method that we present is related to our previous stochastic/perturbation global optimization methods for finding minimum energy configurations, but has several key differences that are important to its success. Our computational results show that the method readily solves a set of artificial problems introduced by More and Wu that have up to 343 atoms. On a set of considerably more difficult protein fragment problems introduced by Hendrickson, the method solves all the problems with up to 377 atoms exactly, and finds nearly exact solution for all the remaining problems which have up to 777 atoms. These preliminary results indicate that this approach has very good promise for helping to solve distance geometry problems.

Reference-contexts: A large number of such methods for solving distance geometry problems have been proposed, such as Crippen and Havel [6], Havel [8], Hendrickson <ref> [9] </ref>, Glunt, Hayden, Raydan [7], and More and Wu [12, 13]. The method we present in this paper is based on the stochastic/perturbation global optimization approach [4, 2, 3, 5] with several new features. <p> Both the selection of small dimensional subproblems and some other important algo 2 rithmic features are specific to the distance geometry problem. We experimented with our algorithm on More and Wu's artificial problems [12] and on the protein fragment problems from Hendrickson <ref> [9] </ref>. For the artificial problems, even our first phase can find the exact solutions with great success. For the protein fragment problems, which are considerably more difficult, we have found the exact solutions solutions for problems with up to 377 atoms (1131 parameters). <p> In practice, lower and upper bounds on distances are specified instead of exact distances. Therefore our algorithm is intended to deal with both exact and inexact distance geometry problems. For the larger protein problems of Hendrickson <ref> [9] </ref>, with up to 777 atoms (2331 parameters), our algorithm has found approximate solutions with maximum relative error of distance at most 0.04. These computational successes on problems of considerable size appear to indicate that our algorithm is a powerful tool for solving distance geometry problems. <p> Also there are huge numbers of local minimizers for the functions (2.4) and (2.5), which makes it very challenging to locate the basin of attraction of the global minimizer. It can be shown that function (2.5) has an exponential number of local minimizers <ref> [9] </ref>. The another important aspect is that most distance geometry problems are large and contain hundreds or more atoms. Thus even the calculation of a local minimizer makes heavy demands on the computer time. <p> Most of the previous work by chemists on the distance geometry problems depends on the intrinsic properties of the chemical structure of solutions. Often, these methods use special heuristics based on chemical properties to generate initial configurations, and then perform local optimizations. The method of Hendrickson <ref> [9] </ref> is of particular interest to this paper because the more difficult test problems that we use are taken from that paper. Hen-drickson's method also utilizes chemical structure information. <p> coincides with this idea and yields an algorithm that can be tailored to find reasonable configurations. 4 Experimental Results We have run our algorithm on a set of artificial distance geometry problems from More and Wu [12, 13], and on a set of protein fragment test problems generated by Hendrickson <ref> [9] </ref>. In all of these problems, we are given the exact distances. In order to have both exactly and inexactly constrained problems for function (2.4), we used l 2 i;j (1 *); u 2 i;j (1 + *) with values of epsilon that are given later. <p> We then proceeded to a set of significantly more difficult test problems. These problems are generated by Hendrickson <ref> [9] </ref> from the bovine pancreatic ribonuclease, a typical, rather small protein containing 124 amino acids. <p> More and Wu [13] tested their method on the smallest of these problems, using function (2.4), and reported success for the values * = 0.10, 0.06, 0.04, 0.02, but not below. For each of the twelve problems of Hendrickson <ref> [9] </ref>, we applied the Phase 2 repeatedly to the function (2.4) with decreasing * until * = 0. In our runs, we usually chose the values * = 0.10, 0.06, 0.04, 0.02, 0.01, 0.00 used by More and Wu [13].

Reference-contexts: Most of our test problems are large, with hundreds or thousands of atoms. Therefore in our implementation, we used the limited memory BFGS algorithm <ref> [11] </ref> to perform the full dimensional local minimizations, whereas the small-scale local minimizations within the small-scale global optimization step used the standard BFGS method. All the experiments were conducted on an Intel Paragon multiprocessor.

Work of this type includes the multistart method and More and Wu's continuation approach <ref> [12, 13] </ref>.

In all of these problems, we are given the exact distances. <p> All the experiments were conducted on an Intel Paragon multiprocessor. In the artificial distance geometry problems from <ref> [12, 13] </ref>, the molecule has m = s 3 atoms located in the three-dimensional lattice f (i 1 ; i 2 ; i 3 ) : 0 i 1 &lt; s; 0 i 2 &lt; s; 0 i 3 &lt; sg for some integer s 1. <p> (s 3 ; s 2 ) where 3 s 7, starting from the domain space B = fx 2 R 3m : 0 (x i ) k s 1; i = 1; ; m; k = 1; 2; 3g and the domain 2B. (These are the same problems reported in <ref> [12, 13] </ref>.) One-atom moves were used in step 1b. The numerical results are presented in Table 4.1, where # fval, #gval and #global are the number of function and gradient evaluations, the global solutions out of the total minimizers, respectively. <p> In our experience, problems that can already be solved in Phase 1 are not particularly difficult global optimization problems. Note also that Phase 1 is in some sense similar to the multistart algorithm except for the one-atom or two-atom steps. Compared to the multistart results in <ref> [12] </ref>, the phase 1 works quite well in this context. We also ran the same artificial problems using the exact version of function (2.4), i.e. with * = 0. The Phase 1 results for these runs are given in Table 4.2. Again, one-atom moves were used in step 1b. <p> For function (2.4), more than half the local minimizations find the global minimizer. These results show that Algorithm 3.1 is very successful on these artificial problems. A comparison with the efficiency of the method of More and Wu <ref> [12, 13] </ref> is difficult in part because they do not give costs in the second of these papers, but mainly because smoothing is a very useful technique that makes problems easier to solve, but has not been used in our algorithm. <p> A second possible direction is to use a buildup approach, where one finds (approximate) solutions to subsets of the problem on the way to solving the full problem. The third, and perhaps most intriguing direction, is to combine a smoothing approach like that of More and Wu <ref> [12, 13] </ref> with our stochastic/perturbation global optimization technique. Our recent research in protein folding has shown that this combination has great potential.
