Abstract: A class of interior-point trust-region algorithms for infinite-dimensional nonlinear optimization subject to pointwise bounds in L p -Banach spaces, 2 p 1, is formulated and analyzed. The problem formulation is motivated by optimal control problems with L p -controls and pointwise control constraints. The interior-point trust-region algorithms are generalizations of those recently introduced by Coleman and Li (SIAM J. Optim., 6 (1996), pp. 418-445) for finite-dimensional problems. Many of the generalizations derived in this paper are also important in the finite-dimensional context. They lead to a better understanding of the method and to considerable improvements in their performance. All first- and second-order global convergence results known for trust-region methods in the finite-dimensional setting are extended to the infinite-dimensional framework of this paper. 1. Introduction. This paper is concerned with the development and analysis

ULBRICH, AND M. HEINKENSCHLOSS setting the affine-scaled trust-region fk^sk p k g no longer enjoys the property of reflecting the distance to the bounding box constraints. Therefore we will allow for a very general class of trust-region scalings in our analysis. See also <ref> [11] </ref>. Since, as mentioned above, the term diag (rf k )J k in the Hessian ^ M k plays the crucial role in this affine-scaling interior-point all convergence results in [6] remain valid. <p> Before we do this, we give two examples of proper choices for d. The first choice d = d I is motivated by the scaling matrices used in [6] (see (1)). Except for points x with g (u)(x) = 0 it equals those used in [6] and <ref> [11] </ref>: d I (u)(x) = &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; u (x) a (x) if g (u)(x) &gt; 0 or b (x) u (x) if g (u)(x) &lt; 0 or (9) The slight modification in comparison to (1) will enable us to establish the valuable relation (16) without a nondegeneracy assumption. <p> Examples for w k are w k = d r k which yields a ball in the ^s-variables, and w k = 1 which leads to a ball in the s-variables. Both choices satisfy (W) if (D3) holds. See also <ref> [11] </ref>. The functions d r k and d 1 k are only well defined if u k 2 B ffi . Therefore, the condition u k + d r k ^s k 2 B ffi on the trial iterate is essential. <p> However, it is important to remark that the bound constraints do not need to be strictly enforced when computing ^s k . For example, in the finite-dimensional algorithms in [6], <ref> [11] </ref>, an approximate solution of min ^ k (^s) subject to k ^w k ^sk p k is computed and then scaled by t k &gt; 0 so that u k + t k d r k ^s k 2 B ffi . <p> If k 3 then choose k+1 2 [fl 2 k ; fl 3 k ]. 16 M.

See, e.g., the problems studied by Burger, Pogu [3], Kelley, Sachs [14], and Tian, Dunn <ref> [20] </ref>. The algorithms in this paper are extensions of the interior-point trust-region algorithms for bound constrained problems in IR N introduced by Coleman and Li [6]. <p> This will be done in x 3. The infinite-dimensional problem setting in this paper is similar to the ones in [12], [14], [15], <ref> [20] </ref>. The general structure of the interior-point trust-region algorithms presented here is closely related to the finite-dimensional algorithms in [6]. However, the statement and analysis of the algorithm in the infinite-dimensional context is more delicate and has motivated generalizations and extensions which are also relevant in the finite-dimensional context. <p> The conditions (A1)-(A4) limit the optimal control problems that fit into this framework. However, a large and important class of optimal control problems with L p -controls satisfy these conditions. For example, the conditions imposed in [12, p. 1270], <ref> [20, p. 517] </ref> to study the convergence of the gradient projection method GLOBAL CONVERGENCE OF TRUST-REGION INTERIOR-POINT METHODS 7 imply our assumptions (A1), (A2), and (A4). The assumption (A3) can be enforced by additional requirements on the functions and S used in [12], [20]. <p> The assumption (A3) can be enforced by additional requirements on the functions and S used in [12], <ref> [20] </ref>. The boundary control problems for a nonlinear heat equation in [3] and in [14], [15] also satisfy the assumptions (A1)-(A4). See [22]. 3. Necessary optimality conditions and affine scaling.

In contrast to the results in <ref> [21] </ref>, our convergence analysis is also applicable to objective functions that are merely differentiable on a Banach space L p (), p 2 (2; 1], which reduces the differentiability requirements substantially compared to the L 2 -Hilbert space framework. <p> Furthermore, for the problem class under consideration our convergence results are more comprehensive than the ones in <ref> [21] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the convergence results proven in this paper extend all the finite-dimensional ones stated in [17], [18], [19] to our infinite-dimensional context with bound constraints. In the follow up paper <ref> [22] </ref> we present a local convergence analysis of a superlinearly convergent affine-scaling interior-point Newton method GLOBAL CONVERGENCE OF TRUST-REGION INTERIOR-POINT METHODS 3 which is based on equation (13) and prove under appropriate assumptions that in a neighborhood of the solution the generated trial steps are accepted by our trust-region algorithms. <p> This extension to the finite-dimensional method, which was originally motivated by the function space framework, has also led to significant improvements of the finite-dimensional algorithm applied to some standard test problems, not obtained from the discretization of optimal control problems. See <ref> [22] </ref>. Trust-region methods for infinite-dimensional problems like (P) have also been investigated by Kelley, Sachs [15] and Toint [21]. In both papers the constraints are handled by projections. The paper [21] considers trust-region algorithms for minimization on closed convex bounded sets in Hilbert space. <p> These convergence results extend all the known convergence results for trust-region methods in finite dimensions to the infinite-dimensional setting of this paper. The local convergence analysis of these algorithms is given in the follow up paper <ref> [22] </ref>, which also contains numerical examples illustrating the theoretical findings of this paper. 2. Review of the finite-dimensional algorithm and infinite-dimensional problem setting. We briefly review the main ingredients of the affine-scaling interior- point trust-region method introduced in [6]. We refer to that paper for more details. <p> It is also worth mentioning that in our context an approximate solution ^s k of (5) satisfying (6) can be easily obtained by applying any descent method which starts minimization at ^s = 0 along the steepest descent direction ^g k . Moreover, we show in <ref> [22] </ref> that near an optimizer satisfying suitable sufficiency conditions admissible trial steps can be obtained from unconstrained minimizers of ^ k by pointwise projection onto B. Here our flexibility in the choice of the trust-region scaling will prove to be valuable. <p> The assumption (A3) can be enforced by additional requirements on the functions and S used in [12], [20]. The boundary control problems for a nonlinear heat equation in [3] and in [14], [15] also satisfy the assumptions (A1)-(A4). See <ref> [22] </ref>. 3. Necessary optimality conditions and affine scaling. The problem under consideration belongs to the class of cone constrained optimization problems in Banach space for which optimality conditions are available (cf. [16]). <p> Here d 0 i is as in (12). Note that the remainder term for d I g does not tend to zero near the sign-change of g (u " ) in contrast to d II g. In fact, it follows from our investigations in <ref> [22] </ref> that kd II (u)g (u) d II (u)g (u) (d 0 II (u)r 2 f (u))(u u)k q = o (ku uk 1 ) for u 2 B, 1 q 1, and u satisfying (O1), (O2), if g : B V ! V is locally Lip- schitz at u and <p> Our example admits the choice q = 1. 1 The advantages of the improved smoothness will be seen in the local convergence analysis <ref> [22] </ref>. 12 M. ULBRICH, S. ULBRICH, AND M. HEINKENSCHLOSS Fig. 1. Smoothness properties of the scaling functions d I (u) and d II (u) 4.2. New coordinates and symmetrization. <p> The trust-region serves as a tool for globalization. Therefore, more general trust-region scalings can be admitted, as long as they satisfy (W) below. This freedom in the scaling of the trust-region will be important for the infinite-dimensional local convergence analysis of this method. See <ref> [22] </ref>. <p> Similar techniques also apply in the infinite-dimensional framework. Practical choices for the infinite- dimensional algorithm will be discussed in <ref> [22] </ref>. 4.5. Cauchy decrease for the trial steps. An algorithm which is based on the iterative approximate solution of subproblem (18) can be expected to converge to a local solution of (P) only if the trial steps s k produce a sufficiently large decrease of k . <p> This is new also from the finite-dimensional viewpoint. Numerical results for optimal control problems governed by a nonlinear parabolic PDE which prove the efficiency of our algorithms can be found in the forthcoming paper <ref> [22] </ref>. Furthermore, we present therein results for finite-dimensional standard test-examples compiled in [8] which verify that a combination of the findings in this work and [22] yield improvements also for finite-dimensional problems. <p> results for optimal control problems governed by a nonlinear parabolic PDE which prove the efficiency of our algorithms can be found in the forthcoming paper <ref> [22] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Dennis, Heinkenschloss, Vicente [10], and Heinkenschloss, Vicente [13] extend these methods to solve a class of finite-dimensional constrained optimization problems with bound constraints on parts of the variables. See also Vicente <ref> [23] </ref>. The interior-point trust-region methods in [6] are based on the reformulation of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) necessary optimality conditions as a system of nonlinear equations using a diagonal matrix D. <p> The analysis performed in this paper allows for a greater variety of choices for the affine scaling matrix and the scaling of the trust-region than those presented previously in [6], [11]. Our convergence analysis is more comprehensive than the ones in [5], [6], [11], <ref> [23] </ref>. In particular, we adapt techniques proposed in Shultz, Schnabel, and Byrd [18] to prove that under mild assumptions every accumulation point satisfies the second-order necessary optimality conditions. <p> If k 3 then choose k+1 2 [fl 2 k ; fl 3 k ]. 16 M.
