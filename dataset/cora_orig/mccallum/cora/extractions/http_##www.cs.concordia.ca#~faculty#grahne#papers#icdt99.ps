Abstract: The foundational homomorphism techniques introduced by Chandra and Merlin for testing containment of conjunctive queries have recently attracted renewed interest due to their central role in information integration applications. We show that generalizations of the classical tableau representation of conjunctive queries are useful for computing query answers in information integration systems where information sources are modeled as views defined on a virtual global schema. We consider a general situation where sources may or may not be known to be correct and complete. We characterize the set of answers to a global query and give algorithms to compute a finite representation of this possibly infinite set, as well as its certain and possible approximations. We show how to rewrite a global query in terms of the sources in two special cases, and show that one of these is equivalent to the Information Manifold rewriting of Levy et al.

Reference-contexts: Next, we study the complexity of conjunctive query evaluation. We show that consistency is coNP-complete in general, but consistency and query evaluation become polynomial when we have only sound or only complete sources. These results extend and generalize earlier ones of Abiteboul and Duschka <ref> [AD98] </ref>. Finally, in Section 4 we show how to rewrite a query on the global schema in terms of the sources, in two cases: when all sources are sound and the certain semantics is of interest, and when all sources are complete and the possible semantics is sought. <p> If S contains both sound and complete sources the problem of testing whether whether a given tuple t is in Q fl (S) is coNP-complete. As an aside we note that Theorem 5.1 in <ref> [AD98] </ref> falls out as a special case of Theorem 8. If S contains only sound or only complete sources query evaluation becomes tractable. Theorem 9. <p> In a recent paper <ref> [AD98] </ref>, Abiteboul and Duschka study the special case in which all sources are sound, or all sources are sound and complete, but do not formulate the more general problem. On the other hand, they consider more general view definitions and queries than conjunctive ones.

Reference-contexts: A global database is a standard multirelational database. We then introduce database templates, a tool for representing sets of global databases. Finally, we define the concept of source collections, modeling a set of sources that we want to amalgamate.

Reference-contexts: In order to finitely represent infinite sets of databases, we introduce templates, and show how to associate with each set of source instances a template that characterizes all databases represented by the sources. A template is a vector of consisting of tableaux <ref> [ASU79] </ref> and a set of constraints. Our constraints are related to the egd's of Beeri and Vardi [BV81]. In Section 3 we present our results. First we give a syntactic characterization of consistent sets of sources in terms of their templates.

Note also that the constraint can encode the pure closed world assumption.

Reference-contexts: The template resulting from the query evaluation will have the empty constraint. It is clear that we thus loose some information. However, the query result will be coinitially equivalent to the desired one. Two sets of databases are coinitial if the have the same set of minimal elements (see <ref> [IL84] </ref>). The coinitiality relation will be denoted . Our extended semantics now has the following correctness property: Theorem 5. rep ( b Q (T )) Q (rep (T )); where the query on the right-hand side is evaluated pointwise.

Reference-contexts: The idea of sources as views on the global schema goes back to the GMAP project [TSI94]. It was subsequently popularized by the Information Manifold project [LRO96,LM*95], which introduced the query algorithm that we characterize in this paper.

Finally, we mention two special cases: Suppose the global database consists of one relation, and all sources are defined by projections.

Reference-contexts: We show that the all-sound, certain-answer rewriting is equivalent to (although different from) the Information Manifold rewriting described by Levy et al. in <ref> [LM*95] </ref> without any formal justification. In fact, this was the original motivation for our work: providing semantics for the mysterious Information Manifold algorithm. 2 The Model In this section we first introduce global databases. A global database is a standard multirelational database. <p> We have seen that rew 1 (Q) is a "sound and complete" rewriting of a query Q with respect to the certain answer on a collection of open views. It turns out that rew 1 (Q) is equivalent to a rewriting technique used in the Information Manifold project <ref> [LM*95] </ref>. <p> However, the following result -indicating that there is little chance of getting rid of the global query size in the exponent- follows easily from <ref> [LM*95] </ref>.

The work of Motro <ref> [Mot97] </ref> is close in spirit and motivation to ours; however, Motro assumes the existence of a "real world" global database instead of modeling the uncertainty in the sources by associating a set of databases with them; this makes it difficult to give precise meaning to his ideas. <p> Acknowledgments We thank NSERC, IRIS and Concordia FRDP for their support, and Anthony Tomasic for pointing out Motro's work <ref> [Mot97] </ref>.
