Abstract: Previous researchers have explored various methods of deriving edge information from luminance derivatives, color contrast, depth information, and textural patterns. However, no single one of these methods is sufficient for detecting all of the contour information that humans perceive. This thesis will be concerned with combining various existing methods of edge identification into a perceptual contour identifier, and the demonstration that the combination of these methods leads to improved contour processing on real-world images.

Reference-contexts: This thesis work will be performed at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory under the direction of Prof. Lynn Andrea Stein. The system will be implemented in LISP on an upper-torso humanoid robot called Cog <ref> [BS93] </ref>. Cog provides an active, binocular, foveated visual system which is suitable for studying contours. The active visual system will allow for eye and head motion for object tracking.

Reference-contexts: To differentiate between perceptual and physical properties, I will use the word "edge" to denote the result of a processing stage on a single physical property, such as those found from normal "edge detection" techniques like the Canny operator <ref> [Can83] </ref>. The word "contour" will refer to the high-level perceptual feature that distinguishes between areas of similarity. <p> Both tasks will rely upon the same basic perceptual contour code with different back-end applications. We will use the physical characteristics from a Canny operator <ref> [Can83] </ref>, Guy and Medioni's point field detectors [GM94], a disparity estimator, and a textural processor. These edge detection methods will then by combined into a single contour identifier.

Reference-contexts: There have been a variety of techniques developed by computational researchers to deal with the problem of illusory contours. Guy and Medioni suggest using point extension fields to extend and complete line segments <ref> [GM94] </ref>. Their work has shown some capacity for recovering illusory contour information from figures such as the Kanizsa triangle and square. Kass, Witkin, and Terzopoulous have used active splines, or "snakes," for a variety of imaging tasks [KWT87]. <p> Both tasks will rely upon the same basic perceptual contour code with different back-end applications. We will use the physical characteristics from a Canny operator [Can83], Guy and Medioni's point field detectors <ref> [GM94] </ref>, a disparity estimator, and a textural processor. These edge detection methods will then by combined into a single contour identifier. The perceptual contours will be used to identify and segment objects from the background. 1 Once objects have been identified, each of the two tasks can operate independently.

Reference-contexts: Even for fields with equal absolute intensity (equal luminance), the color content of that field can determine a contour. With three different types of frequency selective retinal cells, it is not surprising that color is a strong contour 3 <ref> [Gol89] </ref>. determiner. Computational work on "color edge detection" has also given us a variety of techniques for determining color gradients. 2.3 Contours from Retinal Disparity Another strong physical feature that can greatly effect the perception of a contour is the perceived depth of a surface. <p> One-fourth of each circle contains a different orientation of the same texture pattern. In some cases, as in the left circle, texture creates a very striking perceptual contour. While in other cases, as in the right circle, the effect is more subdued. For more detailed information, see [Jul75]. 4 <ref> [Gol89] </ref>. 2.5 Illusory contours Contours can also be formed in regions where no strong physical properties denote them. These types of illusory contours give strong evidence that contours are perceptual and not physical features.

Allusory contours are effects that are context sensitive, and require previous experience to determine the perceptual features of the image. For example, take the well known photograph of a dalmation by R. C. James (see Figure 4).
