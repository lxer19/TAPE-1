Abstract: Given the rapid growth of WWW traffic and the emerging use of the WWW for commercial use, studying access patterns is an important first step in understanding network implications and in designing future generations of WWW servers. We describe Avatar, a virtual reality system for real-time analysis and mapping of WWW server accesses to their point of geographic origin on various projections of the Earth.

Reference-contexts: On the globe or its projection, data can be displayed either as arcs between source and destination or as stacked bars. The former can be used to display communication traffic <ref> [1] </ref>, with the thickness, height, and color of the arc representing specific data 2 The topology is from the reduced USGS ETOP05 database (http://www.usgs.gov/data/cartographic/). 4 attributes. Stacked bars convey information through three mechanisms: position, height, and color bands. <p> Displays such as those in Figure 6 provide the metaphor for interactive query and display of data correlations. 7 Related Work Our work draws on a large body techniques for visualization of network data in the geographic domain. Notable examples include Becker et al's <ref> [1] </ref> techniques for displaying communication traffic, and Cox's [4] animation of NSFNET traffic. Both show network connections by drawing links between nodes and show in 7 bound traffic by assigning traffic volume to a range of colors. <p> We have found that the geographic display metaphor has provided new insights into the dynamic of traffic patterns and provides a model for development of a WWW server control center, similar to that in network operations <ref> [1] </ref>.

We also thank Thomas Kwan for his work on the data retrieval system.

Reference-contexts: The SDDF records are sent via UDP sockets to the Avatar virtual reality software. Avatar then renders the data in the NCSA CAVE <ref> [5] </ref>, an unencumbered environment for immersive data analysis. In the following section, we describe the data immersion software in detail. 4 Avatar Virtual Reality System Avatar is a virtual reality framework, built on the Pablo performance analysis toolkit [11], that supports multiple metaphors for display of dynamic data [12].
