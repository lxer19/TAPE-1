Abstract: This paper compares the retrieval effectiveness of a lattice-structured hypertext of indexing information (hyperindex) against a faceted hierarchical thesaurus. The former is shown to be at least as effective as the latter using formal criteria employed in an experimental setting. In addition, the automatic derivation of so called index expressions from titles is also elucidated. From these index expressions it is shown how the hyperindex can be generated.

Reference-contexts: In this work, the notion of the predictability of a disclosure system is introduced, but is informally defined. A basis of a formal definition of predictability can be found in the notion of a logical decision <ref> [Bla90] </ref>. This notion can be explained in terms of the hyperindex: At each focus the searcher can refine, enlarge or perform a beamdown operation on the focus.

Reference-contexts: Some searchers using the catalogue system of a slides library (slibrary) were having problems finding relevant slides using the existing hierarchical classification system. It was then decided to build a hypertext of indexing information a hyperindex <ref> [Bru90] </ref>, to allow structured browsing through the catalogue. The question then arose as to whether the hyper-index indeed offered any improvement on the disclosure of the information in the catalogue. <p> Also, for those searchers who have no clear notion of their information need, an index is often helpful to clarify this need. A hyperindex is an index organized in the form of a hypertext. This form of index is formally introduced in <ref> [Bru90] </ref> where it is presented in the framework of a two level hypermedia architecture [BvdW90b]. The hyperindex forms the top level of the architecture. It is a hypertext of index terms which index the underlying hyperbase. <p> Start 4 disciples 4 Jesus 4 proclamation 4 resurrection resurrection 4 proclamation of resurrection 4 resurrection of Jesus 5 Start resurrection of Jesus 4 proclamation of resurrection of Jesus 5 resurrection 5 Jesus ? The index terms in the hyperindex have the form of so called index expressions <ref> [Bru90] </ref> [BvdW90a]. In contrast to keywords or term phrases index expressions have a structure (see figure 5). This figure also shows that the relationships between terms are also modelled. These relationships are termed connectors, or operators, which are basically restricted to prepositions. <p> This aspect of a disclosure system is referred to its collocation. Collocation is informally introduced by Craven [Cra86]. A formalization of collocation can be found in <ref> [Bru90] </ref>.

The hyperindex forms the top level of the architecture. It is a hypertext of index terms which index the underlying hyperbase. The feature of the hyperindex is its structure which provides the opportunity to browse through the index terms in an organized fashion. <p> When an index term is found which describes the information need, the objects characterized by this index term can be retrieved and examined. Navigating through the hyperindex and retrieving information in the above way has been coined Query By Navigation <ref> [BvdW90b] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In these tests we will also look at the collocation of the hyperindex. We are also developing a logic based information disclosure machine based on index expressions <ref> [BvdW91b, BvdW91a] </ref>. That the hyperindex can be built automatically can be considered as both advantageous and disadvantageous. It is advantageous because manual indexing is laborious and time consuming task which can be error prone.

Reference-contexts: Such a choice is an example of a logical decision. Logical decisions are also involved in browsing thesauri <ref> [CD90] </ref>. While searching a faceted hierarchical thesaurus such as iconclass, a choice must be made between the available subfacets. Predictability can now be formalized in the following way: The predictability of a disclosure system is inversely proportional to the number of logical decisions necessary to find a target descriptor.

In our case the logging was intended to record actions corresponding to a logical decision of the searcher. Other possibilities for logging have also been employed. For example, in <ref> [CE89] </ref> the time the searcher spent at each focus was recorded. The log file for each Hyperindex user consisted of recordings of the following events: Selecting a term in the Finder, Refining or Enlarging the current focus or a beamdown, i.e. retrieval of the slides characterized by the current focus.

Reference-contexts: Derivation of Index Expressions from Title De scriptions Titles are very often in a form which is amenable to an almost direct translation to an index expression. (Earlier work in this area was done by Craven regarding the automatic derivation of linked-phrase indexes (an index expression variant) from document titles <ref> [Cra86] </ref>). Note, however, that headings will not always be content revealing. Sometimes they are used for structural organization, for example, the heading Introduction. In the context of the slides library, some titles do not relate the subject matter of the associated art object. <p> In these studies criteria such as search time, number of pages turned, were used to assess the browseability of subject indexes. These criteria were then were further developed in relation to judging navigation in online subject indexes <ref> [Cra86] </ref>. In this work, the notion of the predictability of a disclosure system is introduced, but is informally defined. A basis of a formal definition of predictability can be found in the notion of a logical decision [Bla90]. <p> It is therefore important that relevant descriptors be near each other in the disclosure system so that when the searcher finds a relevant descriptor, other relevant descriptors are also found. This aspect of a disclosure system is referred to its collocation. Collocation is informally introduced by Craven <ref> [Cra86] </ref>. A formalization of collocation can be found in [Bru90].

Reference-contexts: Such descriptors tend to have higher precision and lower recall <ref> [Sal89] </ref>. It is therefore not surprising that the precision of both disclosure systems was generally high. 5.3.2 Recall Problems occurred with both systems regarding recall. With regard to iconclass queries 2,3,4 and 8 demonstrated low average recall.
