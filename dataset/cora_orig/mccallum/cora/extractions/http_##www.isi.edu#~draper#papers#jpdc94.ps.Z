The models of [9, 15] are the only previous works which address wormhole routing. However, other models have addressed virtual cut-through routing <ref> [2] </ref>. In this paper, we present a relatively simple model for performance evaluation of wormhole routing in unidirectional k-ary n-cubes. Its simplicity results from its basis on well-known queuing theory principles.

Reference-contexts: The present generation of multicomputers are able to reduce hardware communication overheads of first-generation machines by over two orders of magnitude by employing innovative routing techniques based on virtual cut-through [13] or its blocking variant, wormhole routing <ref> [3, 6] </ref>. Wormhole routing is a pipelined, circuit-switching mechanism that is being used in several multicomputers such as the Symult 2010, NCube 2 and iWarp [17, 21]. <p> Consequently, its performance degrades rapidly as the message traffic increases beyond some level as a high percentage of the messages get blocked before they can reach their destination. The other drawback of a blocking technique is the possibility of deadlock if the routing scheme is not appropriately constrained <ref> [6] </ref>. Several techniques have been suggested and/or implemented which augment the basic wormhole routing scheme to achieve performance improvements while maintaining a simple implementation of a routing element. For example, the links connecting the nodes to routing elements in the iWarp machine have a higher bandwidth than network channels [17]. <p> Several adaptive wormhole routing algorithms have been proposed to improve message latency and network utilization in torus 3 interconnection networks [4]. A good introduction to various aspects of wormhole routing can be found in [18]. With such a diversity of schemes for augmenting the basic wormhole routing formulation of <ref> [6] </ref>, a need for a robust analytical model has developed. Such a model would be useful for performance evaluation of existing schemes as well as for indicating where extra resources could be added to improve performance. <p> The RE contains one flit buffer for each incoming network virtual channel, where a virtual 5 channel is merely a logical channel and multiple virtual channels may share the same physical channel. Virtual channels were first introduced for providing deadlock-free routing in k-ary n-cubes <ref> [6] </ref>. The PE is assumed to have infinite buffer space for queuing up messages for the injection channel and receiving messages from the ejection channel. 2.2 Flow Control Flow control within the network is based on wormhole routing. <p> A slight augmentation must be made to implement deadlock-free routing in general k-ary n-cubes. Notice that deadlock cycles can occur within a dimension in k-ary n-cubes due to the wraparound channels. As suggested by <ref> [6] </ref>, virtual channels are used to transform these cycles into spirals. All but two channels in a unidimensional cycle are broken up into pairs of virtual channels (refer to Figure 2). A virtual channel pair is implemented by time-multiplexing onto the associated physical channel.

Reference-contexts: This purpose of this addition is to remove any bottleneck that is imposed by these channels. The Torus Routing Chip (TRC) contains output queues which have a 4-flit capacity <ref> [7] </ref>. While only one flit buffer per channel is needed to implement wormhole routing, the output queues allow the time spent in waiting for a channel to be overlapped with the time spent in traversing another channel. Therefore, message latencies are reduced.

Reference-contexts: While only one flit buffer per channel is needed to implement wormhole routing, the output queues allow the time spent in waiting for a channel to be overlapped with the time spent in traversing another channel. Therefore, message latencies are reduced. Another suggested alternative is virtual channel flow control <ref> [10] </ref>. In this scheme, there are several parallel flit buffers (virtual channels) allocated for each physical channel, where the virtual channels are time-multiplexed onto the physical channel. This scheme reduces contention for resources and, thus, supports a greater throughput. <p> Thus, a greater performance improvement results by adding extra resources to the network channels rather than the injection/ejection channels. Such a philosophy is exhibited in schemes like virtual channel flow control <ref> [10] </ref> and MECA [11]. To substantiate the arguments stated above, we conducted another set of experiments 19 in which the injection (ejection) channels are capable of sourcing (sinking) the traffic on up to n output (input) channels of the RE simultaneously.

However, the blocking nature of wormhole routing leads to a differentiation among channels in different dimensions when e-cube routing is used <ref> [15] </ref>. This is because a message that blocks when trying to traverse an ith dimension channel may occupy some higher dimension channel but will not be using any lower dimension channel at that time.

Known as Burke's theorem <ref> [16] </ref>, this property holds for M/M/1 queuing systems. Since this property does not hold for M/G/1 queuing systems, we later use correction factors to rectify. We first derive the message arrival rate for channels in a general k-ary n-cube and simplify the expression for binary hypercubes.
