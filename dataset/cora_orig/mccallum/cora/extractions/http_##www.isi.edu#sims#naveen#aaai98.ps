Abstract: The Web is based on a browsing paradigm that makes it difficult to retrieve and integrate data from multiple sites. Today, the only way to do this is to build specialized applications, which are time-consuming to develop and difficult to maintain. We are addressing this problem by creating the technology and tools for rapidly constructing information agents that extract, query, and integrate data from web sources. Our approach is based on a simple, uniform representation that makes it efficient to integrate multiple sources. Instead of building specialized algorithms for handling Web sources, we have developed methods for mapping Web sources into this uniform representation. This approach builds on work from knowledge representation, machine learning and automated planning. The resulting system, called Ariadne, makes it fast and cheap to build new information agents that access existing web sources. Ariadne also makes it easy to maintain these agents and incorporate new sources as they become available.

Reference-contexts: The SIMS query planner (Knoblock 1995), based on UC-POP <ref> (Barrett et al. 1993) </ref>, was designed primarily for database applications. But whereas database applications typically involve only a small number of databases, web applications can involve accessing many pages. Therefore we needed an approach capable of efficiently constructing larger query plans.

Reference-contexts: Discussion There are many examples of impressive AI systems based on relatively simple representational schemes. In the realm of planning, recent examples include SAT-plan (Kautz and Selman 1996) and Graph-plan <ref> (Blum and Furst 1995) </ref>; the former employs a propositional CSP approach, the latter, a graph-based search. In machine learning, propositional learning schemes (e.g., decision trees) have been dominant.

Reference-contexts: Currently, mapping tables and functions must be created manually, but we are developing a semi-automated method for building mapping tables and functions by analyzing the underlying data in advance. The basic idea is to use Information Retrieval techniques to provide an initial mapping (e.g., <ref> (Cohen 1997) </ref>), and then use additional data in the sources to resolve any remaining ambiguities via statistical learning methods (e.g., (Huang and Russell 1997)).

Reference-contexts: Related Work There is large body of relevant literation on information integration (Wiederhold 1996), but the most closely related work focuses specifically on the problems of information integration on the Web, such as Information Manifold (Levy et al. 1996), Occam (Kwok and Weld 1996), Infomaster <ref> (Genesereth et al. 1997) </ref>, and InfoSleuth (Bayardo Jr. et al. 1997). These systems focus on a variety of issues, including the problems of representing and selecting a relevant set of sources to answer a query, handling binding patterns, and resolving discrepancies among sources.

Reference-contexts: The focus of all of these systems are on building wrappers for semi-structured sources. The systems either take a template-based specification of a source, as in <ref> (Hammer et al. 1997) </ref>, or learn the structure of the source by example and then compile a wrapper that provides access to the source, as in (Kushmerick 1997). Our work on inducing wrappers takes the latter approach.

The induction method is not only very general, but is also integrated into the larger Ariadne development system so that the learned wrappers can be used directly by the query planner.

Reference-contexts: To move to the Web, we only needed one extension to the basic representation, which was the inclusion of "binding patterns" <ref> (Kwok and Weld 1996) </ref>. That is, unlike database sources, web sources may have input/output constraints (e.g., a stock quote server requires a ticker symbol in order to retrieve a stock quote). This is a minor extension that is naturally handled by the source selection algorithm and planning operators. <p> Related Work There is large body of relevant literation on information integration (Wiederhold 1996), but the most closely related work focuses specifically on the problems of information integration on the Web, such as Information Manifold (Levy et al. 1996), Occam <ref> (Kwok and Weld 1996) </ref>, Infomaster (Genesereth et al. 1997), and InfoSleuth (Bayardo Jr. et al. 1997).
