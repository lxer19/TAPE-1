Reference-contexts: We then examine subject performance on a simple physics problemsolving task, looking at high-level data (total latency, correctness, etc.) as well as low-level data (visual scans, key presses, etc.). We also present a model developed under the ACT-R framework <ref> (Anderson, 1993) </ref> which succeeds in predicting much of the experimental data collected. We conclude by discussing related work and the implications of our work for other research in analogy. <p> In the remaining sections, we address how production system architectures can help achieve these goals. 2. The Production Rule Approach to Analogy 2.1. Overview of Production System Architectures In recent decades, several major cognitive architectures based on production rules have emerged; among others, ACT-R <ref> (Anderson, 1993) </ref>, Soar (Laird, Newell, & Rosenbloom, 1987; Newell, 1990), CAPS (Just & Carpenter, 1992), and EPIC (Kieras & Meyer, 1995a) have enjoyed some success in the modeling world. Though their particular implementations differ, these architectures have several common goals.

Reference-contexts: work in a broad range of areas, including human-computer interaction (John, Vera, & Newell, 1991; Kieras, Wood, & Meyer, 1995b), natural language comprehension (Just & Carpenter, 1992; Lehman, Lewis, & Newell, 1991), working memory and memory span (Anderson & Matessa, in press; Anderson, Reder, & Lebire, in press), visual attention <ref> (Anderson, Matessa, & Douglass, 1995) </ref>, robotic planning and execution (Laird & Rosenbloom, 1990), reasoning (Polk & Newell, 1995), strategy selection (Lovett & Anderson, 1995), and mathematical problem solving (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, & Pelletier, 1995). <p> natural language comprehension (Just & Carpenter, 1992; Lehman, Lewis, & Newell, 1991), working memory and memory span (Anderson & Matessa, in press; Anderson, Reder, & Lebire, in press), visual attention (Anderson, Matessa, & Douglass, 1995), robotic planning and execution (Laird & Rosenbloom, 1990), reasoning (Polk & Newell, 1995), strategy selection <ref> (Lovett & Anderson, 1995) </ref>, and mathematical problem solving (Anderson, Corbett, Koedinger, & Pelletier, 1995).

Reference-contexts: Another key element of analogical reasoning is the retrieval of an appropriate source analog for mapping. The source may constitute some mental structure stored in memory <ref> (e.g., Anderson & Thompson, 1989) </ref>, or may come from the external world in another form, such as written text (e.g., VanLehn & Jones, 1993). Successful retrieval proves to be extremely difficult for humans in certain situations, as has been manifested in several experiments using a hint/no-hint paradigm. <p> However, models for analogical tasks all share a specific set of productions that implement analogy. In other words, the common thread that binds models of analogical tasks is the presence of these analogy productions. Production rule models already incorporate this idea for other common processes <ref> (see Singley & Anderson, 1989) </ref>; for instance, two models that require adding numbers could use the same productions to implement addition. <p> Presumably, many of the rules (for scanning, typing, etc.) are in place at the onset of the task. However, we could argue that the task invokes the creation of certain specialized productions that act as schemata for problem solving <ref> (see Anderson & Thompson, 1989) </ref>. This crucial issue is beyond the scope of this model; much further analysis of the task would be required to determine how and when such rules are created. Second, there may be other strategies which subjects utilize when first attempting the task. <p> Thus superficial similarities can affect both the mapping process that produces a schema (our research) and the use of the schema (Rosss research). Anderson (1993) has discussed the creation of schematic ACT-R productions as a result of analogy <ref> (see also Anderson & Thompson, 1989) </ref>. ACT-Rs socalled analogy mechanism builds new productions that map a subgoal to another subgoal using an example from declarative memory. The analogy mechanism and our analogical framework both involve what might be called analogy, but they operate on very different levels.

Reference-contexts: For example, Keane et al. (1994) presented empirical data for subjects performance on the attribute mapping task. They compared their empirical data to the predictions of three analogical theories: SME <ref> (Falkenhainer, Forbus, & Gentner, 1989) </ref>, ACME (Holyoak & Thagard, 1989a), and their own IAM. Since none of the theories make predictions about directly observable quantities like latency, Keane et al. compared the theories by relating subjects total time for completion to the number of mappings generated by the models. <p> Though the comparison works well in this context, this metric may not generalize well to other theories; in fact, even within the paper, the authors noted a caveat when applying the metric to the Structure Mapping Engine <ref> (Falkenhainer et al., 1989) </ref>. Production system architectures can help address such problems. Since most architectures have a limited-capacity memory built into the system, any analogy model developed in the architecture must necessarily deal with working memory constraints.

Production system models of analogy do not have these limitations, as evidenced in the simple physics and people-piece models. 7.2. Other Related Work Rosss work (1989) discusses the effects of superficial similarities when analogizing.

Reference-contexts: Table 1 shows the equations used for each topic; the first three equations are of equal complexity, while the others range in difficulty from fairly easy to fairly difficult. All topics and equations were taken from a standard physics textbook <ref> (Halliday & Resnick, 1988) </ref>, massaged in some cases to fit the task, but still mathematically correct. Subjects were to type their answers as instantiated equations, without simplifying; for example, they were to type answers such as 3*6/2, instead of simplifying this quantity and entering 9. <p> Materials. We designed eight sets of five simple physics problems, where each set dealt with a different topic (as shown in Table 1). The equations were adapted from those in a standard introductory physics textbook <ref> (Halliday & Resnick, 1988) </ref> and simplified to use only basic arithmetic operations. For each topic, we created a sample problem and five test problems. The sample problems solution comprised a step with the variables and operators, and a step where the variables were replaced with their corresponding values.

Reference-contexts: Such predictions could be made by ACT-Rs strength learning mechanism, as we have seen with respect to the simple physics learning model in Figure 4. Another analogy mechanism, the Incremental Analogy Machine (IAM), centers on an incremental mapping strategy from source to target <ref> (Keane et al., 1994) </ref>. IAM addresses working memory constraints by incrementally mapping parts of the source to parts of the target. The algorithm operates in six steps. First, a seed group, or group of predicates with the most higher-order connectivity, is selected from the base domain.

Reference-contexts: Different strategies can be used for both domainspecific and analogical skills. Thus, production systems allow for multiple implementations of the analogy process and can decide between them probabilistically. Certain architectures also allow for erroneous firings of productions that mimic systematic errors in problem solving, another source of subject variability <ref> (e.g., Lebire, Anderson, & Reder, 1994) </ref>. Such techniques provide methods of generating different traces for each run, such that one run represents the actions of one simulated individual. Of course, a modeler can easily derive aggregate results for the model by averaging traces from multiple stochastic runs.

Reference-contexts: We can also examine the total latency per set of five problems. The solid lines in Figure 4 show the average time (in seconds) taken by subjects to complete sets one through eight. The first three points manifest the beginnings of the familiar power learning curve <ref> (Newell & Rosenbloom, 1981) </ref>; recall that the problems in these sets have the same complexity, each having an equation with two variables and one operator. Subjects here were both familiarizing themselves with the system and honing their analogy skills as they pertain to these problems.

Reference-contexts: Representation is pervasive in the analogy process, and though we sometimes label it as the first subprocess of analogy <ref> (e.g., Reeves & Weisberg, 1994) </ref>, we may more appropriately think of it as a precondition for successful analogizing. Another key element of analogical reasoning is the retrieval of an appropriate source analog for mapping.

Reference-contexts: However, models for analogical tasks all share a specific set of productions that implement analogy. In other words, the common thread that binds models of analogical tasks is the presence of these analogy productions. Production rule models already incorporate this idea for other common processes <ref> (see Singley & Anderson, 1989) </ref>; for instance, two models that require adding numbers could use the same productions to implement addition.

Reference-contexts: Another key element of analogical reasoning is the retrieval of an appropriate source analog for mapping. The source may constitute some mental structure stored in memory (e.g., Anderson & Thompson, 1989), or may come from the external world in another form, such as written text <ref> (e.g., VanLehn & Jones, 1993) </ref>. Successful retrieval proves to be extremely difficult for humans in certain situations, as has been manifested in several experiments using a hint/no-hint paradigm.

Reference-contexts: Researchers have found that people use different strategies when analogizing (e.g., Chi, Feltovich, & Glaser, 1981; Novick, 1988; Spellman & Holyoak, 1993; Whitely & Barnes, 1979) and can adapt these strategies during learning <ref> (e.g., Zhu & Simon, 1987) </ref>. Existing theories that define a single deterministic mechanism to implement analogy can account for some variability, to the extent that the theory expresses the differences in terms of the problem representation.
