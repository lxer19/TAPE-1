Reference-contexts: Introduction There is growing interest in teaching real world problem-solving tasks using computer-based intelligent apprenticeship environments in which students learn by doing <ref> (Gott, 1989) </ref>. Such skills typically involve complex chains of hidden reasoning and one goal of an apprenticeship environment is to help externalize the cognitive processes that usually take place only mentally.

Reference-contexts: Although many have argued that reflective interactions can be an important part of the learning process, there has been no systematic attempt to develop a model of the type of dialogue that will facilitate learning through reflection. Experience with the Sherlock system <ref> (Lesgold et al., 1992) </ref>, an intelligent apprenticeship environment that trains avionics technicians to troubleshoot complex electronic devices, has shown that building a system to participate in reflective dialogues in a complex domain poses a difficult challenge. A rudimentary rfu facility has been implemented in Sherlock.

Reference-contexts: To tackle this problem, we have begun a detailed linguistic analysis of the explanations in our corpus. From a pilot study, we have reason to hypothesize that marker selection is influenced by the intentional and informational relations <ref> (Moore and Pollack, 1992) </ref> between text segments, the topic structure of the text, the size of the segments being related, and the embedding of relations in the hierarchical structure of the text.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm computes similarity of student actions based on a set of features that were derived from a cognitive task analysis aimed at identifying the factors that expert avionics tutors use in assessing student's troubleshooting actions <ref> (Pokorny and Gott, 1990) </ref>. We found that human tutors explicitly referred to a prior justification (as in Figure 2) in 73% of the cases identified by the cbr algorithm.
