Abstract: Many commonly used time-frequency distributions are members of Cohen's class. This class is defined for continuous signals and since time-frequency distributions in Cohen's class are quadratic, the formulation for discrete signals is not straightforward. Cohen's class can be derived as the class of all quadratic time-frequency distributions that are covariant to time shifts and frequency shifts. In this paper we extend this method to three types of discrete signals to derive what we will call the discrete Cohen's classes. The properties of the discrete Cohen's classes differ from those of the original Cohen's class. To illustrate these properties we also provide explicit relationships between the classical Wigner distribution and the discrete Cohen's classes.

Reference-contexts: Note that the kernels are defined on a hexagonal sampling grid as indicated above. The kernels corresponding to the spectrogram, Born-Jordan, Rihaczek, Page, and Levin distributions are all direct discretizations of the corresponding kernels for Cohen's class TFDs <ref> [2, 3, 37] </ref>. The binomial kernel [40] satisfies many desirable properties of TFDs and the recursive structure also allows the implementation of fast algorithms. The type II Cohen's class also provide the framework for the discrete formulation of the cone kernel [34].

Reference-contexts: In addition we suspect that applications of TFDs such as spectrogram decomposition [36, 39] and signal synthesis [50, 44, 46] will be more robust for the type II Cohen's class than they are for the type I Cohen's class. Boashash <ref> [18] </ref> has created a class of discrete TFDs for type II signals called Generalized Discrete Time-Frequency Distributions (GDTFDs). While the implementation of this method is slightly simpler conceptually since all functions are defined on rectangular grids, there are many disadvantages to this method.

Reference-contexts: IV Type II Cohen's Class The above proof for the type I Cohen's class extends directly to form the type II Cohen's class, which is identical to the class of AF-GDTFDs <ref> [26] </ref>. The AF-GDTFDs were known to be covariant to time and frequency shifts, but it was not known until this point that the AF-GDTFDs include all type II TFDs that are covariant to time and frequency shifts. <p> An unusual feature of R II x (n; m) and (n; m) is that they are only defined when fn m 2 ; mg 2 ZZ, resulting in a hexagonal sampling grid. The class of AF-GDTFDs were originally presented <ref> [26] </ref> in the form of equation 4b however 5 this notation is somewhat cumbersome due to the hexagonal sampling. The forms in equations 4a and 4c arrive naturally from the derivation and provide a more elegant notation. <p> In [41] we present an alternative definition of the type I (classical) Wigner distribution that generalizes straightforwardly to all four signal types. Under this definition we have shown that the type II Wigner distribution does not exist. For this reason the type II quasi-Wigner distribution was created <ref> [26] </ref>. The type II quasi-Wigner distribution provides very little smoothing so is, in a sense, "close" to a Wigner 6 distribution. 3 The type II quasi-Wigner distribution will be useful for illustrating the properties of the type II Cohen's class. <p> kernel by ~ (n; m), then it is straightforward to see that we are computing the exact same distribution: C II X X ~ R II fi fi fi n2ZZ However, if we reverse the order of the summations, then we can express TFDs in the type II 3 In <ref> [26] </ref> this distribution was called, without justification, a discrete Wigner distribution, we have chosen to call it a quasi-Wigner distribution because it is "close", but it is not the real thing. 7 Cohen's class in terms of a time-sampled, type I Wigner distribution: 4 C II x (n; !) fl n <p> Due to the extreme smoothing nature of the type II spectrogram, it is difficult to find an example where all six components would be visible. 10 IV-D Additional Properties When the class of AF-GDTFDs was originally presented by Jeong and Williams <ref> [26] </ref>, they also derived kernel constraints for the distributions to satisfy many desirable properties: realness, positivity, time shift covariance, frequency shift covariance, time marginals, frequency marginals, finite time support, finite frequency support, instantaneous frequency, and group delay.

However in [26] the kernel constraints for the group delay, instantaneous frequency, and finite frequency support properties are incorrect. We have investigated this in greater detail and provided corrections in [38] but must be omitted here due to space limitations.

Reference-contexts: This form makes it clear that the spectrogram is a member of Cohen's class, and that, under certain constraints, elements of Cohen's class can be decomposed into weighted sums of spectrograms [36]. The cross terms in the Wigner distribution <ref> [37] </ref> satisfy the following properties: * cross terms are centered exactly between two auto terms, * if two auto terms are separated in frequency by ! , then the rate of oscillation of the cross term in the time direction is ! , and * if two auto terms are separated <p> Note that the kernels are defined on a hexagonal sampling grid as indicated above.

Here, we will briefly investigate the kernel constraints for the finite frequency support property and Moyal's formula. <p> The proof is straightforward and is presented in <ref> [38] </ref>. Examples of TFDs that satisfy this constraint are the type II Rihaczek, Page, and Levin distributions. IV-E Aliasing The above analysis provides an explicit mechanism for understanding the properties of distributions in the type II Cohen's class. <p> However, the following properties of TFDs in the type II Cohen's class: * there exist distributions that satisfy Moyal's formula (and thus can reconstruct the signal to within a constant phase <ref> [46, 38] </ref>), * the extra terms do not prevent the time and frequency marginals from being satisfied, * the extra terms always exist, even when the signal is severely oversampled, * the extra terms behave like cross terms with regard to their location and attenuation, * the extra terms are necessary <p> For more details see <ref> [38] </ref>. Three examples of modified kernels in the time-frequency plane, P (n; k), are shown in Figure 7 The first corresponds to the type IV binomial distribution, the second corresponds to the type IV quasi-Wigner distribution, and the third corresponds to a type IV spectrogram with a Hanning window. <p> The configuration of the auto terms and cross terms for a two component signal is depicted in Figure 3. Note that all of these cross terms are necessary for a type IV TFD to satisfy the time and frequency shift covariance properties <ref> [38] </ref>. We will not develop the rate of oscillation of the cross terms in the time and frequency directions and the attenuation properties since they are a direct extension of the type II Cohen's class outlined above. <p> Other alternatives for the instantaneous frequency and group delay properties could have been considered, as was done for the type II Cohen's class in <ref> [38] </ref>. VI-D Examples We now prevent several examples to illustrate the properties of the type IV Cohen's class. We will use the three of the type IV distributions mentioned above. The first is a type IV spectrogram with a Hanning window. <p> The GDTFDs and their relationships with the type I and type II Cohen's classes are examined in much greater detail in <ref> [38] </ref>. Given the above, the Cohen's classes seem preferable to the GDTFDs. VIII Conclusions The most well known known and most often used TFDs are those in Cohen's class.

Reference-contexts: h fl (n 2 n) e j!(n 1 n 2 ) This form makes it clear that the type II spectrogram is a member of the type II Cohen's class and that elements in the type II Cohen's class can be decomposed into a weighted sum of type II spectrograms <ref> [39] </ref>. IV-A Distributions in the Type II Cohen's Class In Table 2 we present the kernels of several time-frequency distributions in Cohen's class. The kernels are formulated in the time-lag plane, since this form of the kernel is discrete in both variables. <p> In contrast to the type I Cohen's class, it is very straightforward to accurately compute type II, III, and IV TFDs. In addition we suspect that applications of TFDs such as spectrogram decomposition <ref> [36, 39] </ref> and signal synthesis [50, 44, 46] will be more robust for the type II Cohen's class than they are for the type I Cohen's class. Boashash [18] has created a class of discrete TFDs for type II signals called Generalized Discrete Time-Frequency Distributions (GDTFDs).

Reference-contexts: Note that the kernels are defined on a hexagonal sampling grid as indicated above. The kernels corresponding to the spectrogram, Born-Jordan, Rihaczek, Page, and Levin distributions are all direct discretizations of the corresponding kernels for Cohen's class TFDs [2, 3, 37]. The binomial kernel <ref> [40] </ref> satisfies many desirable properties of TFDs and the recursive structure also allows the implementation of fast algorithms. The type II Cohen's class also provide the framework for the discrete formulation of the cone kernel [34].

Reference-contexts: Discretization methods [20, 22, 21, 33] have failed to produce a satisfactory type II Wigner distribution since they require the signal to be oversampled by a factor of two. In <ref> [41] </ref> we present an alternative definition of the type I (classical) Wigner distribution that generalizes straightforwardly to all four signal types. Under this definition we have shown that the type II Wigner distribution does not exist. For this reason the type II quasi-Wigner distribution was created [26]. <p> For example the type IV Rihaczek distribution can be expressed as: RD IV We have also generalized the binomial distribution to the type IV Cohen's class, but we have not included the kernel in Table 4 since it has a complicated form. As mentioned above, in <ref> [41] </ref> we presented an alternative definition of the classical Wigner distribution that extends easily to the three types of discrete signals. Surprisingly, under this definition, the type IV Wigner distribution exists only for signals with an odd length period.

Reference-contexts: However, since the frequency variable of type II Cohen's class TFD is periodic, the finite frequency support property is not well defined!

Reference-contexts: While the type I Cohen's class is very interesting theoretically, it is not always clear how to accurately compute these distributions. For example, the Cho-Williams distribution <ref> [49] </ref> is often cited in the literature, but the kernel, as defined in the ambiguity plane, is not band-limited and does not have compact support. In addition, the kernel does not have a closed form in the time-frequency plane.
