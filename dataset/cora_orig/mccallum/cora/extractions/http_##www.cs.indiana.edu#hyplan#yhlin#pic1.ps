Abstract: Many large image databases are springing up as cheap optical technology finally lets users store large numbers of images. The database community has few solutions to the problem of finding one image, picture, or face out of a million. We present a solution which is simple, intuitive, and permits image-based searching on a large database by selection.

Reference-contexts: The police sketch artist faces such a holistic problem. A witness has a vague recollection of a suspect's appearance, but has no good way to formalize the individual components in a query format. Caldwell and Johnston <ref> [3] </ref> address this problem by asking the user to rate how closely each of several candidate images resembles the suspect; the user acts as the fitness function for the GA. Such a system is still tedious to use, however; a user must typically rank several hundred faces before convergance.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction When designing interfaces for image databases, current database ideology suggests query-based interfaces expressed in SQL or similar languages (e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>.) We believe this approach is not well suited to typical use. Query-based interfaces are hard for most non-experts to use, and wearying even for experts.

Reference-contexts: Query-based interfaces are hard for most non-experts to use, and wearying even for experts. Users must possess knowledge about the domain of the database, the functionality of the retrieval system, and the classification scheme employed by the database; even experienced users may have difficulty constructing effective queries <ref> [6] </ref>. Further, the interface programmer has to deal with complicated interface design or language issues.

Reference-contexts: A file with mostly upper-case letters may be old indeed. Layout: A file containing formatted text, such as a report, may be readily recognizable from the general structure of the text of the front page; a thumbnail sketch <ref> [9] </ref> may prove useful. If such a scheme were in widespread use, or if it could be made user-dependent, say by the user supplying a file of important keywords, then it would be a handy tool to roam around the net with.

Reference-contexts: We contend simple microfeature analysis will prove sufficient to be useful within some domains like eyeballs, while expert-guided analysis may be necessary for complex domains like insects; however, 6 Pic1 is still useful on constructed domains even without this analysis. More sophisticated data modeling methods (e.g. <ref> [11] </ref>) could also be employed.

Reference-contexts: This is what's missing from most databases. Lacking distance metrics, database queries have to be exact. Essentially, a user has to already know the database and how it's organized to use other methods. Existing databases with distance metrics (e.g. <ref> [12] </ref>) generally exploit similarities in specific fields to permit approximate matches, but still require explicit queries. 8 4.

Reference-contexts: Despite the presence of a grid, a organizing the set by 1 dimension seems a reasonable simplifying assumption; the grid can display the sorted images with a Cantor sequence, keeping similar images close together. The set of points could be so ordered with projection (e.g. <ref> [20] </ref>.) In addition to simple selection, the user interface should permit the user to specify meta-information about the searching process.

Reference-contexts: Pic1's search process proceeds by presentation of examples from the database rather than by specifying abstract qualitites about desired records; this derives from RABBIT <ref> [21] </ref>, which uses retrieval by reformulation to teach the user about the classification structure of the database.

Reference-contexts: Such a system is still tedious to use, however; a user must typically rank several hundred faces before convergance. Some significant work has been done on addressing this problem with regard to faces; the CAFIIR system <ref> [22] </ref>, for example, organizes images of faces through feature analysis and permits flexible retrieval in a variety of methods, including query-by-example and evolutionary browsing. To date, systems have not typically attempted to generalize beyond restricted domains like frontal views of faces. 5 Pic1's Advantages Pic1 has four main advantages: 1. <p> useful dimensions of variation within images (as opposed to, say, Medieval castles, which would be very difficult to do.) An effective system, of course, would also permit more classical queries based on patient name, disease classification, or other data in a hybrid fashion, similarly to the hybrid describe by Wu <ref> [22] </ref>. 6.5 Other applications The possibilities for a Pic1-like naviation tool are vast; some other uses include: * Satellite and military reconnaissance * Career counseling * Navigation * Choosing a pet, date, house, or car * Identifying a tree, bug, rock, cloud, architectural style, painting: : : 7 Alternative Mechanisms *
