Title: ReAligner: A Program for Refining DNA Sequence  
Author: Multi-Alignments Eric L. Anson and Eugene W. Myers 
Keyword: fragment assembly, round-robin realignment, multiple alignment, consensus score/sequence.  
Abstract: We present a round-robin realignment algorithm that improves a potentially crude initial alignment of an assembled collection of DNA sequence fragments, as might, for example, be output by a typical fragment assembly program. The algorithm uses a weighted combination of two scoring schemes to achieve superior multi-alignments, and employs a banded dynamic programming variation to achieve a running time that is linear in the amount of sequence in the data set. We demonstrate that the algorithm improves upon the alignments produced by other assembly programs in a series of empirical experiments on simulated data. Finally, we present a pair of programs embodying the algorithms that are available from the Web site ftp://ftp.cs.arizona.edu/realigner.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we arrived at a round-robin algorithm which we present in detail in this paper. Like the hidden Markov model, it also has the virtue of using the entire multi-alignment to derive each refinement. The iterative technique was first introduced in the context of aligning sequences of proteins <ref> [2] </ref>. Our realization of the round 4 robin algorithm iteratively aligns each sequence with the multiple alignment of the remaining sequences. Thus the algorithm is comparatively efficient since it is just a series of pairwise alignments where one sequence is ordinary and the other is a multi-alignment.

Reference-contexts: In some cases this score improves while the number of miscalls remains roughly the same. What is happening in these case is that the alignment improves the evidence that the given consensus symbol is indeed correct, in say, the sense of the Church-Waterman statistic <ref> [3] </ref>. For example, in Figure 8 a portion of a CAP2 multi-alignment at left was improved by ReAligner to the portion at right.

Reference-contexts: What makes this possible is that the dynamic programming algorithm for aligning two sequences can be made to work when one or both of the input sequences is itself a multi-alignment. This strategy can be traced to a 1984 paper of Waterman and Perlwitz 3 <ref> [10] </ref>, and has been implemented, with numerous variations on the basic theme, by many investigators, e.g., [5, 9, 4, 6].
