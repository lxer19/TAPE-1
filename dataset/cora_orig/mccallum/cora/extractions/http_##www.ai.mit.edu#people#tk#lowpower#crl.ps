Abstract: As clock and logic speeds increase, the power requirement of CMOS circuits are rapidly becoming a major concern in the design of personal information systems and large computers. In this paper we present a practical implementation of a new CMOS logic family, Charge Recovery Logic (CRL), with a power dissipation that falls with the square of the operating frequency, as opposed to the linear drop of conventional CMOS circuits. We show that such power saving is achieved with moderate increases in area and circuit complexity. The technique relies on constructing an explicitly reversible pipelined logic gate, where the information necessary to recover the energy used to compute a value is provided by computing its logical inverse. Information necessary to uncompute the inverse is available from the subsequent inverse logic stage. Depending on the Q of available inductors, we anticipate energy savings of over 99% per logic operation for logic which is clocked sufficiently slowly.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In principle, a computing engine need not dissipate any energy, as shown in the work of Landauer, Bennett, and Feynman [8] <ref> [1] </ref> [3]. Although these authors approach the problem from different disciplines and use different physical as well as theoretical models, they all conclude that the transfer of energy through a dissipative medium dissipates arbitrarily small amounts of energy if this transfer is made sufficiently slowly.

Reference-contexts: The third is due to the switch-ing current which is caused by both N-Channel and P-Channel devices being simultaneously ON for a brief time during a swing of V dd 2V T <ref> [2] </ref>. We can approximate this switching dissipation by V dd fi 2 2R V dd 2V T fi 2RC which for a typical V dd = 4V T simplifies to 1 4 CV 2 dd . As V dd drops below 2V T this switching dissipation becomes negligible.

Admittedly, the above solution is more of theoretical than practical interest. If reversibility needs to be broken, that is, when information loss cannot be avoided, then some dissipation will occur for every lost bit of information.

Reference-contexts: It is this observation that is the core of a number of proposals to construct low power electronic computing engines. By low power, or non-dissipative, we mean that the energy per computational step can be made arbitrarily small by spreading the computation over a longer period. Fredkin and Toffoli <ref> [4] </ref> demonstrated one realization of a low power universal gate using conservative logic. In conservative logic, the information content as well as the number of 1's and 0's are conserved throughout the computation. One property of a computation using conservative logic is the production of unwanted intermediate outputs.

Reference-contexts: One property of a computation using conservative logic is the production of unwanted intermediate outputs. Unfortunately, discarding these outputs results in energy dissipation. Recycling it however, does not. It is this operation of recycling that requires the use of reversible logic <ref> [5] </ref>. The CMOS gate proposed by Fredkin and Toffoli could not be easily integrated, however, as it requires the use of inductors internal to the computational network. The sizes and numbers of these inductors are well beyond what can be easily accommodated on a silicon substrate. <p> With this topology, we can proceed without any dissipation by continually supplying delayed copies of the input to the pipeline at the inverse input on the far right.

Reference-contexts: The authors having successfully fabricated and op 2 erated numerous circuits using this style still warned of the importance of device sizing to achieve enough bootstrapping for proper operation. More recently, Koller and Athas <ref> [7] </ref> proposed a form of dual rail logic that achieved adiabatic switching. Not using reversibility, they were unable to completely remove the power dissipation of their latches and commented that "to return the energy to the power supply without dissipating it, we must remember which output line we are charging.

Reference-contexts: At liquid nitrogen temperatures, the mobility of carriers in MOS devices increases 4 times under low field conditions and 1.7 times under high field conditions. Operating under both high and low field conditions, the measured mobility increase in conventional CMOS 15 averages to about 2.5 times <ref> [9] </ref>. In contrast, CRL operation is by design limited to low field operation and would therefore retain the full benefit of 4 times mobility increase at LNT. 8 Reliability The reliability of CRL circuits should be excellent.
