Abstract: In recent years, the Chaos Project at the University of Washington has analyzed and simulated a dozen routing algorithms. Three new routing algorithms have been invented; of these, the chaotic routing algorithm (a.k.a. Chaos) has been the most successful. Although the Chaos router was developed for multicomputer routing, the project has recently directed its attention towards the application of Chaos technology to LAN switching. The present task is to implement a gigabit LAN called ChaosLAN, based on a centralized switch (hub) and high speed serial links to workstations. The switch itself is a fully-populated two-dimensional torus network of Chaos routers. The host adapter is Digital's PCI Pamette card. To evaluate the performance of ChaosLAN, we are supporting the Global Memory System (GMS), a type of distributed virtual memory also developed at UW. We also describe an application involving real-time haptic rendering used in a surgical simulator. This work may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part for any commercial purpose.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The case for a high-performance local area network for the construction of a parallel computer using a network of workstations (NOW) is well understood <ref> [1] </ref>. One goal is to provide a scalable platform for parallel programs using low-cost workstations or PCs, comparable in performance to that of a multiprocessor system but at far lower cost.

Generally, it delivers higher throughput than its competitors with similarly low latency. <p> If all goes well, we expect to have an operational system by the end of the year. At time of publication we do not have any performance measurements available for ChaosLAN. Results of simulation studies are available on the Chaos routing algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> and the Cranium network interface [5]. Some variables not captured by prior simulation studies on chaotic routing are the effects of the PCI bus implementation and the operating system on overall system performance. Both factors are expected to have a significant impact on the performance of ChaosLAN.

Reference-contexts: Adaptivity also complicates the re-assembly of packets at the receiver, because packets can overtake one another due to internal congestion, and cause packets to arrive in a different order than they were injected into the network. Hardware assistance for re-assembly of non-ordered packets has been studied extensively <ref> [4] </ref> and an inexpensive, streamlined host adapter to interface with an adaptive network has been proposed by McKenzie [5]. Although the Chaos router was developed for multicomputer routing, the project has recently directed its attention towards applying Chaos technology to LAN switching. <p> To be successful, the network interface circuit in the host adapter must provide user programs with low latency access. The implementation of the Pamette network interface circuit is based on the Cranium network interface architecture <ref> [4, 5] </ref>, a low latency interface framework that also provides compatibility with adaptive routers such as Chaos. Providing a low-latency, low-overhead solution requires two important features. The first requirement is to bypass the operating system and provide direct application program access to the network wherever possible. <p> The host adapter notifies the host processor when all packets for a given DMA channel have arrived. The following is a brief overview of how direct application access is implemented in the host adapter. (Also see the documents on Cranium <ref> [4, 5] </ref> for a more detailed description.) The host adapter must act on behalf of the operating system to check arguments in message commands coming from the application program, to prevent buggy or malicious user programs from crashing the operating system, for instance.

Reference-contexts: We chose PCI as the peripheral bus standard due to its wide availability across IBM PC compatibles, Power Macintoshes and Unix-based workstations. To ex MERL-TR-97-08 July 1997 6 pedite the construction of the host adapter card, we are basing it on Digital Equipment Corporation's PCI Pamette card <ref> [7] </ref>. Figure 3 shows an overview of the Pamette. It contains five Xilinx logic cell arrays or LCAs, more generically known as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). One FPGA, called the PCILCA or PIF, provides an interface with the PCI bus.

Reference-contexts: The physical link protocol is based on the Fibre Channel physical interface (FC-PH), an ANSI standard for gigabit serial interconnection <ref> [8] </ref>. While the physical transfer protocols are the same as specified in the Fibre Channel standard, a custom protocol is used for higher levels. The specification of FC-PH describes three different layers, called FC-0, FC-1 and FC-2, representing the physical medium, the parallel-to-serial conversion and packet framing, respectively.

Reference-contexts: The serial bit rates are specified at 1062.5 Mbit/s, 531.25 Mbit/s and 265.625 Mbit/s. FC-1, the protocol for parallel to serial encode and decode, is based on an 8b/10b coding scheme patented by IBM <ref> [9] </ref>. Eight bits of message data are converted into 10 bits of serial data using multiple codings. To improve the reliability of the link, the encoder chooses an encoding on a byte-by-byte basis over long byte strings that best equalizes the total number of high and low bits sent.

GMS is based on the idea of paging over the network to idle workstations instead of to local disk. As network bandwidth approaches the bandwidth of a locally attached disk, paging over the network becomes the faster solution once the communication latency becomes sufficiently low.

Reference-contexts: The effect is that the haptic input device cannot plug directly into the compute server due to cable length limitations. The solution is to drive the haptic device off a local workstation and communicate with the compute server over a LAN. constructed at MERL A Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory <ref> [12] </ref>. The haptic input device is the PHANToM from SensAble Devices. The position of the PHANToM stylus in 3-space is captured by a local workstation. The local workstation performs haptic rendering and a remote compute server performs graphics rendering.

Their measurements demonstrate that PCI performance results vary considerably across different implementations.
