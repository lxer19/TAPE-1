Abstract: We describe a repository of data for the testing of numerical algorithms and mathematical software for matrix computations. The repository is designed to accommodate both dense and sparse matrices, as well as software to generate matrices. It has been seeded with the well-known Harwell-Boeing sparse matrix collection. The raw data files have been augmented with an integrated World Wide Web interface which describes the matrices in the collection quantitatively and visually. For example, each matrix has a Web page which details its attributes, graphically depicts its sparsity pattern, and provides access to the matrix itself in several formats. In addition, a search mechanism is included which allows retrieval of matrices based on a variety of attributes, such as type and size, as well as through free-text search in abstracts. The URL is http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/.

Reference-contexts: For sparse matrices the Harwell-Boeing Sparse Matrix Collection has served this purpose exceptionally well for some time. Release I of that collection <ref> (Duff, Grimes and Lewis, 1989) </ref> contains nearly 300 matrices of order 9 to 35,558 from a variety of applications. One of the difficulties with such collections is that their size and diversity makes them unwieldy to manage and use effectively. <p> A value may be continued onto successive lines by placing a TAB as the first character on each additional line. Attributes may appear in any order. Many of the attributes represented in the database correspond to information provided in the Harwell-Boeing report <ref> (Duff, Grimes and Lewis, 1989) </ref>. Table 1 lists the attributes currently represented in the Matrix database; Figure 1 provides an example entry. <p> Details of the format are provided in <ref> (Duff, Grimes and Lewis, 1989) </ref>. The format has several advantages. First, it includes a detailed header with a variety of descriptive information, such as matrix labels, type, order, number of nonzeros, etc.

Reference-contexts: In the final section, we outline plans for extending this service to dense matrices and matrix generation software, as well as ideas for use of new WWW technologies such as Java <ref> (Flanagan, 1996) </ref> to enhance its the usefulness. 3 A MATRIX META-DATABASE As a collection of test problems becomes large and diverse it becomes increasingly important to have effective tools for finding problems which have particular characteristics of interest. <p> Such a service could provide access to proprietary matrix generators (with author permission of the authors). * Executable WWW Content. A third option is to provide the matrix generator as executable WWW content such as provided by Java <ref> (Flanagan, 1996) </ref>. In this case, the generator is downloaded to the user's WWW browser, where it queries the user for values of its parameters, and then executes on the user's local machine.

Reference-contexts: Most of these, and others, are computed by tools such as the INFOFUN routine of SPARSKIT <ref> (Saad, 1994) </ref>. Since such data might only be of limited value in searching we have not included it in our database.
