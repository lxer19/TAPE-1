Title: Stylistic Variation in an Information Retrieval Experiment  
Author: Jussi Karlgren 
Address: New York University  
Affiliation: Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences  
Abstract: Texts exhibit considerable stylistic variation. This paper reports an experiment where a corpus of documents (N= 75 000) is analyzed using various simple stylistic metrics. A subset (n = 1000) of the corpus has been previously assessed to be relevant for answering given information retrieval queries. The experiment shows that this subset differs significantly from the rest of the corpus in terms of the stylistic metrics studied.

Reference-contexts: Word statistics word length, long word counts, type/token ratios as a measure of terminological complexity have often been paired with sentence length to produce readability scores and recently to study variation in various varieties of language, as well as perform genre discrimination <ref> [1, 2, 8, 9] </ref>. Table 1 contains a summary of the simple statistics. Relevant texts, besides being longer, also have longer sentences. The differences between relevant and non-relevant are significant in a Mann Whitney test on a 95% confidence level for all statistics except average word length.

Reference-contexts: sizes of the sets. 4.1 Simple statistics: Sentence Length and Word Statistics A simple word count reveals that relevant texts on the average are longer than other texts - which also has been observed, pointed out, and utilized by the very successful Cornell research group at the latest TREC conference <ref> [3] </ref>. Word statistics word length, long word counts, type/token ratios as a measure of terminological complexity have often been paired with sentence length to produce readability scores and recently to study variation in various varieties of language, as well as perform genre discrimination [1, 2, 8, 9].

Reference-contexts: Average number of tiles ratios. Sentence length as used above is one such method, although arguably a blunt one what syntactic constructions are complex in themselves, and when they are evidence of complexity in an already complex subject matter is a matter of contention <ref> [4] </ref>. As a somewhat deeper approximation of clause complexity, we will look at the average depth of output trees from a robust parser built for information retrieval purposes [12].

Reference-contexts: These assessments the relevance judgements are used in this experiment to categorize the entire corpus. Given a query, the corpus has three types of document: relevant texts, not relevant texts, and not judged (i.e. not retrieved) texts <ref> [6] </ref>. In this experiment, if a text was judged relevant for any query at all in the test set we will consider the text relevant. For this experiment, a part of the TREC test corpus was selected: 74 516 Wall Street Journal articles from years the 1990, 1991, and 1992.

Reference-contexts: Running a subtopic segmentation algorithm over a number of texts 3 produces the expected result. For the experiment we ran a system - TextTiles which cuts up a text into tiles, tentative subtopic segments <ref> [7] </ref>. For the purposes of the experiment, only the number of tiles were retained.

Reference-contexts: The difference is better than 95% significant by Mann Whitney U for the larger number of documents, for the long texts the risk of random results is around 10%. 4.2 Syntactic complexity Syntactic complexity is a dimension which exhibits considerable variation between genres <ref> [10, 11] </ref>. Indeed, most stylistic measures heretofore have been attempts to find shortcuts for measuring syntactic complexity along with lexical complexity as measured by word length and type-token 3 This experiment ran on a smaller corpus of only relevant and non-relevant documents.

Reference-contexts: As a somewhat deeper approximation of clause complexity, we will look at the average depth of output trees from a robust parser built for information retrieval purposes <ref> [12] </ref>. The parser was set to skip parsing after a timeout threshold, and when it does so, it notes it has done so in the parse tree. These skip marks were counted again, as an indication of clausal complexity.

Reference-contexts: The focus will be on stylistic variation based on the specific genres or functional styles that occur in a daily newspaper as opposed to individual styles <ref> [13] </ref>. Especially, the experiment investigates how the variation relates to the usefulness of texts in a large scale information retrieval experiment.
