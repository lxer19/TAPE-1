Abstract: We define and study a high-level language for describing actions that extends the language A introduced by Gelfond and Lifschitz. The new language, AR 0 , allows us to describe actions with indirect effects (ramifications) and simple forms of nondeterminism. A translation from AR 0 into a formalism based on circumscription is proved to be sound and com plete.

Reference-contexts: In [ Kartha, 1993 ] , the methods for formalizing action in classical logic proposed in [ Pednault, 1989 ] and [ Reiter, 1991 ] , as well as the use of circumscription in <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> , are described as translations from A, and the soundness and completeness theorems for these translations are stated. <p> In Section 6, the language A from [ Gelfond and Lifs-chitz, 1993 ] is embedded into AR 0 . In Section 7, we use the ideas of <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> to define a translation from AR 0 into the formalism of nested abnormality theories [ Lifschitz, 1995 ] . This formalism is based on circumscription, and permits nested applications of the circumscription operator. <p> A, has models in the sense of AR 0 (with * as the the only executable string of actions). 7 Translating from AR 0 into Circumscription In this section, we use AR 0 to study the range of applicability of the approach to representing actions by circumscriptive theories developed in <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> . Baker's method is applied in [ Lifschitz, 1991 ] to a class of reasoning problems characterized in terms of their syntactic form, and in [ Kartha, 1993 ] to the problems expressible in A. <p> According to the existence of situations principle, for any assignment of values to fluents, there normally exists a situation in which every fluent takes the assigned value. Recognizing the role of this principle was a major contribution of <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> . Constraints represent exceptions to this default. For instance, the constraint Holds (Walking ; s) Holds (Alive; s) (14) shows that there is no situation in which Walking is true and Alive is false. <p> Similarly, in the nested abnormality theory fiD, the translations of the value propositions form a separate group of axioms that is not placed in the range of any circumscriptions. The use of nested abnormality theories, instead of conjunctions of circumscriptions as in <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> and [ Lifschitz, 1991 ] , leads to a simpler and more natural presentation of Baker's method. Moreover, the use of conjunctions of circumscriptions along the lines of that earlier work does not seem to lead to satisfactory results when actions can be nondeterministic.

In [ Thielscher, 1993 ] , the language A is related to the ideas of [ Sandewall, 1992 ] .

Reference-contexts: In the same spirit, A is translated into abductive logic programming in [ Dung, 1993 ] and <ref> [ Denecker and De Schreye, 1993 ] </ref> , and into equational logic programming in [ Thielscher, 1994 ] . <p> In many ways, however, the expressive possibilities of this language are limited. This has led to the development of a few enhancements of A. Dung [1993] proposed a "relational" version of A, in which fluents and actions may have arguments. In <ref> [ Denecker and De Schreye, 1993 ] </ref> and [ Thielscher, 1994 ] , dialects of A are outlined in which one can describe actions with nondeterministic effects. Baral and Gelfond [1993] extend A by an operator for the concurrent execution of a set of actions.

Reference-contexts: The claim that such a method is adequate turns then into a mathematically verifiable property of the corresponding translation. Competing methods can be compared by comparing the high-level languages to which they are applicable. In <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1993 ] </ref> , for instance, a new method for representing actions in logic programming is specified as a translation from a subset of A into a logic programming language, and the translation is proved to be sound relative to the semantics of A. <p> Thus in AR 0 , as in classical logic, definitional extensions are conservative. 6 Relation to A We claimed in Section 3 that the language A from <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1993 ] </ref> can be viewed as a subset of AR 0 . Now this assertion can be given a precise meaning.

Reference-contexts: preconditions"|the conditions that need to be satisfied in order for an action to affect a specific fluent| but also "action preconditions," which, if violated, make the execution of an action impossible. 1 In AR 0 , we can specify a "coordinate frame" in the space of situations, as suggested in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1990 ] </ref> ; the com-monsense law of inertia applies only to the fluents that belong to the frame. Finally, the effects of the actions described in AR 0 can be nondeterministic. The syntax of the new action language is described in Section 2. <p> In the first model, the action of inserting the card cannot be executed. Example 2: Nonframe Fluents. There are two switches and a light; the light is on only when the switches are both on or both off <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1990 ] </ref> . This system can be described using three propositional flu-ents Switch1, Switch2 and Light ; only the first two belong to the frame. There are two action names, Toggle1 and Toggle2 .

Reference-contexts: A 1 ^ : : : ^ A n with C 1 ; : : : ; C m allowed to vary; we denote this circumscription by CIRC [A 1 ^ : : : ^ A n ; Ab; C 1 ; : : :; C m ]: (13) (See <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1993a ] </ref> for the definition of the circumscription operator.) Unfortunately, this is not general enough for the purpose of representing defaults, and "prioritized circumscription" is proposed in [ Mc-Carthy, 1986 ] as a more general representation tool.

Reference-contexts: Baral and Gelfond [1993] extend A by an operator for the concurrent execution of a set of actions. The dialect of A defined in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1993b ] </ref> provides symbols for time intervals. This paper addresses yet another limitation of A|its inability to represent domain constraints. In A, any combination of fluent values represents a possible state of the system. The extension of A presented below is, in this respect, different.

Reference-contexts: This is what one would intuitively expect, because an additional value proposition in a domain description expresses merely an additional assumption about the "trajectory" under consideration. The observation made above is a "restricted mono-tonicity property" in the sense of <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1993c ] </ref> . Propositions of all four types play the role of postulates, and value propositions play the role of sentences, assertions and parameters. A similar fact about the language A is stated in [ Lifschitz, 1993c ] as Proposition 3. 5 Two Theorems about Domain Descriptions In this <p> The observation made above is a "restricted mono-tonicity property" in the sense of <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1993c ] </ref> . Propositions of all four types play the role of postulates, and value propositions play the role of sentences, assertions and parameters. A similar fact about the language A is stated in [ Lifschitz, 1993c ] as Proposition 3. 5 Two Theorems about Domain Descriptions In this section, we show how two ideas familiar from classical logic|the "replacement property" and the notion of an explicit definition|can be applied to the language AR 0 . 5.1 Replacement Let T be a set of constraints.

Reference-contexts: In Section 6, the language A from [ Gelfond and Lifs-chitz, 1993 ] is embedded into AR 0 . In Section 7, we use the ideas of [ Baker, 1991 ] to define a translation from AR 0 into the formalism of nested abnormality theories <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1995 ] </ref> . This formalism is based on circumscription, and permits nested applications of the circumscription operator. In this framework, Baker's approach to the frame problem can be presented in a particularly simple form. At the end of the section, a soundness and completeness theorem is stated. <p> We restrict attention to finite domain descriptions, that is, to domain descriptions with finitely many flu-ents, actions and propositions. 7.1 Nested Abnormality Theories The formalism of nested abnormality theories is introduced in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1995 ] </ref> . Its use is demonstrated there by recasting several familiar applications of circumscription in its framework|inheritance hierarchies, the domain closure assumption, and the causal minimization approach to the frame problem. <p> The syntax of simple abnormality theories is defined in such a way that Ab may even have different arities in different blocks. We turn now to the formal treatment of the subject. The definitions below are reproduced from <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1995 ] </ref> . Consider a language L of classical logic which may have variables of several sorts and higher-order variables. We assume that L does not include Ab among its symbols.
