Reference-contexts: Under the assumption that the empirical energy function models the folded state of a protein exactly, the tertiary structure represented by the global minimum of this function will be the native state of the protein. According to Abagyan 8 and Argos this can not be assumed <ref> [AA92] </ref>. Their belief is that the current empirical potential energy functions do not resemble the actual folded state closely enough. Therefore, global optimization methods should create many minimizers, instead of just one (the global minimum).

Reference-contexts: The state of the protein corresponding to this global minimum is believed to be the native state we are looking for <ref> [Aba93] </ref>. This approach is much cheaper than the laboratory approaches, since it does not require any expensive technology. Instead, it simulates the folding process. It is also much faster, so many more trials can be done. <p> Research is still going on in order to account for these limitations. 3.3 Global Optimization Methods According to Abagyan, global optimization methods have the largest potential to solve the protein folding problem <ref> [Aba93] </ref>. Given an empirical energy function, global optimization methods try to find the global minimum of this function.

Reference-contexts: First we describe the parallelism in the first phase of the algorithm, after which we describe the parallelism in the second phase. We do not describe parallelism in general; the reader is referred to the wealth of literature that is available on this topic (see for example [GL88] [LER92] <ref> [AG94] </ref>). In the next sections we discuss differences between the sequential execution and the parallel execution. It should be noted that since the algorithm is based on random sampling, two different runs can produce different results. Therefore, if we talk about differences between algorithms, we abstract from this fact.

Reference-contexts: The protein folding problem is defined in <ref> [Anf73] </ref> as the problem of finding the native state of a protein in its normal physiological milieu. As in the cluster problems, this is believed to be a unique state.

Reference-contexts: This tertiary structure is the final folded state in which the protein resides. It is believed that a protein first folds some regions into secondary structure, after which it folds these regions into its final tertiary structure <ref> [Bal89] </ref>. Research is still going on in determining whether a protein folds through a single sequential pathway [Cre88], or whether there is no unique folding pathway [SK90]. It has even been proposed that a protein folds like humans solve a jigsaw puzzle, with multiple routes to a single solution [HD85].

Reference-contexts: It differs from AMBER and CHARMM in the sense that a lot of the terms that can vary in these two energy functions, are rigid in ECEPP. AMBER, developed by Weiner et al [WKNC86], and CHARMM, developed by Brooks et al <ref> [BBO + 83] </ref>, are very similar with only slight differences in the energy terms. For the research described in this thesis, we have used the CHARMM potential energy function. The CHARMM potential energy function is based on separable internal coordinate terms and pairwise nonbonded interaction terms. <p> However, the main part of the algorithm is written in the programming language C. The code to evaluate the potential energy of a protein was supplied to us by Teresa Head-Gordon, and is the potential energy evaluation routine of the CHARMM package <ref> [BBO + 83] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The Water problem is to find the native state of a group of water molecules, whose potential energy is given by a sum of energy terms between pairs of water molecules. A global optimization approach to this problem has been described in <ref> [BDE + 93] </ref> and [Old93]. 3 Characteristic of both the Lennard-Jones and the Water problem is that their potential energy functions have lots of local minimizers, many near the global minimum. <p> In the last section we describe how its parallel implementation influences the algorithm. 4.1 The Lennard-Jones And The Water Algorithms The basis for our new global optimization algorithm is formed by the algorithms developed for the Lennard-Jones problem [BES92] and the Water problem <ref> [BDE + 93] </ref> [Old93]. These algorithms are reviewed briefly in this section. The Lennard-Jones and the Water problem are very similar. Both problems have a potential energy function that is partial separable. <p> Algorithm 4.1 outlines the framework of the global optimization algorithm in terms of the Water problem. Eventually, the best minimizer in the list of full-dimensional local minimizers should be the global minimum. This algorithm has been implemented on a parallel machine, and is exhaustively described in <ref> [BDE + 93] </ref> and [Old93]. 4.2 Outline Of The New Algorithm If we take a look at the protein folding problem, it becomes clear that the Water algorithm as it is can not be applied. The main reason is the chain structure of a protein.

Reference-contexts: The Lennard-Jones problem is to find the native state of a group of identical atoms, whose potential energy is given by the sum of pairwise Lennard-Jones potentials. Global optimization approaches to solve this problem have been explored by many researchers, including <ref> [BES92] </ref>, [Xue94], and [Nor87].

Reference-contexts: appears to take too much time to be a serious candidate for finding the native state of larger proteins. 3.4 Alternative Methods Besides the prediction and global optimization methods, research efforts towards solving the protein folding problem over the past years have resulted in a wide variety of approaches [BHW87] <ref> [BG85] </ref> [PS87] [GLSW92] [HGSA91]. Although some of these methods seem to be promising, researchers have paid more attention to two other types of methods. The first type combines a smart initial protein building phase with an energy minimization phase.

Reference-contexts: Recent work in the build-minimization area has focused on applying a Monte Carlo chain growth technique [LS87] <ref> [BGOV93] </ref> [Vel] to build the initial conformations before minimization. The conformation is built atom by atom or amino acid by amino acid, thereby placing the atom or amino acid with a certain probability at a certain position. This probability can be assigned any distribution. <p> The best minimizer we found for the protein of size 10 is in a perfect ff-helical shape, which is in accordance with the results presented in [WC90] and the predictions made in [Vel] and <ref> [BGOV93] </ref>. For the protein of size 20, our results are in agreement with [WC90] and [BGOV93]. Despite the fact that the second phase does not improve over the first phase, the protein of size 30 is not in its global minimum yet. <p> The best minimizer we found for the protein of size 10 is in a perfect ff-helical shape, which is in accordance with the results presented in [WC90] and the predictions made in [Vel] and <ref> [BGOV93] </ref>.

Despite the fact that the second phase does not improve over the first phase, the protein of size 30 is not in its global minimum yet. If we examine the structure found, it turns out that the ends of the conformation are not in their most favorable position.

Reference-contexts: conformations will be of great importance for biomedicine: in designing novel proteins, in decoding the genetic information obtained by the Human Genome Project, in designing new drugs, and in trying to understand the structures and functions of the thousands of proteins that are being discovered every day in biotechnology labs <ref> [CD93] </ref>. Currently, the native state of a protein (i.e., the unique three-dimensional folded structure) can not be predicted from its primary structure. Although biophysicists are able to build new proteins, i.e., build a sequence of amino-acids, a newly constructed protein immediately folds into its native state. <p> Therefore, finding the global minimum, and consequently the native state, is a very hard problem. 2.3 The Protein Folding Problem A problem that is closely related to the cluster problems mentioned above, is the problem that will be addressed in this thesis: the protein folding problem <ref> [CD93] </ref> [Ric91]. The protein folding problem is defined in [Anf73] as the problem of finding the native state of a protein in its normal physiological milieu. As in the cluster problems, this is believed to be a unique state. <p> If the energy is higher, the new configuration is accepted with a certain |low| probability. This process is analogous to the Simulated Annealing process (see 3.3.1). The lattice based search method was pioneered by Chan and Dill <ref> [CD93] </ref> and it was refined by Skolnick and Kolinski [SK90] [SK91]. They report some good results. However, as O'Toole and Panagiotopoulos point out [OP92], the results obtained by Skolnick and Kolinski are obtained by biasing the objective function to have certain residues take on certain conformations.

However, the memory in the KSR is treated as being global: every processor has access to all memory.

Reference-contexts: We have done preliminary tests using this approach and the results encourage us to continue pursuing this approach. A second approach is to use smoothing <ref> [CSW91] </ref> [CSW94]. The original potential energy function contains many local minima. Smoothing tries to limit the search space by defining a sequence of functions, each function more `smooth' than the previous one.

Reference-contexts: For proteins, the speculation is that the potential energy function has at least 3 n local minima, n being the number of free variables [LS87] [WCMS88]. Therefore, the protein folding problem belongs to the class of NP-hard problems <ref> [CSW94] </ref>. <p> We have done preliminary tests using this approach and the results encourage us to continue pursuing this approach.

Reference-contexts: This point is called a local minimizer. Many algorithms have been developed to solve this problem (see <ref> [DS83] </ref>). However, a nonlinear function can have many local minimizers in its domain D. Finding the lowest minimizer among these local minimizers is the objective of global optimization.

Reference-contexts: Hopefully, one of the structures after local minimization |specifically, the one with the lowest potential energy| will be the structure of the native state. Many secondary structure prediction methods have been developed (see <ref> [Fas89] </ref>). One of the oldest and best known algorithms is the Chou & Fasman algorithm. Recently, neural networks have been used to predict the secondary structure of a protein.

Reference-contexts: Poly (58-Ala) is the most interesting case. Weili and Cui [WC90], using their simulated annealing algorithm, find ff-helical structures for poly (L-Ala) up to 80 amino-acids. However, Head-Gordon and Stillinger <ref> [HGS92] </ref> show that for poly (58-Ala) a lower minimizer exists: two parallel ff-helices, connected by a fi-bend. The best minimizer we have found, after 250 iterations of the second phase of our algorithm, has this particular shape.

The values of the free dihedral angles of the proteins of size 3 and 5 are equal to the ones listed in <ref> [HGSA91] </ref>. The best minimizer we found for the protein of size 10 is in a perfect ff-helical shape, which is in accordance with the results presented in [WC90] and the predictions made in [Vel] and [BGOV93].

Reference-contexts: The limited accuracy of the predictions is believed to be due to the relatively small number of proteins from which the conformational parameters are calculated. Also, secondary structure might be influenced by the tertiary structure, which is not taken into account at all in this method <ref> [HK89] </ref>. Despite its limitations, the method is very popular and widely used. Many improvements, which we will not discuss here, have been proposed and implemented. <p> A subset of these was used to train the network; the rest were used to test the network. This resulted in a performance of about 64 percent correct predictions. Based on these experiments, various other neural networks were tried <ref> [HK89] </ref> [KCL90] [SLX92], but none of them was able to substantially improve the performance. This seems to be due to the same reasons as the Chou & Fasman algorithm: the limited size of the training set and the influence of tertiary structure on secondary structure.

Reference-contexts: However, some methods are applicable to larger problems. The best known are simulated annealing and the genetic algorithm. We will describe both algorithms in greater detail below. 3.3.1 Simulated Annealing Simulated Annealing, first reported by Kirkpatrick et al <ref> [KGV83] </ref>, is based on a connection between statistical mechanics and the process of crystallization. If a physical system is melted and then cooled slowly, the entire arrangement can be made to produce the most stable (crystalline) arrangement, and not get trapped in a local minimum [WC90].

It should be noted that since the algorithm is based on random sampling, two different runs can produce different results. Therefore, if we talk about differences between algorithms, we abstract from this fact.

Reference-contexts: Of course the success of these methods depends completely on how well the initial protein conformations cover the complete conformational space. Which local minimization technique is used does not significantly influence the results. Many techniques have been used for building the initial conformations, among which are random creation <ref> [Lev83] </ref>, tree searching [LS88], and dynamic programming [VD90]. However, as soon as larger proteins are addressed, these methods do not perform as well, due to either the randomness of the technique (the first method), or the fact that the search space becomes too large (the latter two methods).

Reference-contexts: The best function value then presumably will be the global minimizer. Le Grand and Merz applied this technique to the protein folding problem, using the AMBER potential energy function <ref> [LM92] </ref>. The technique produced the correct results for a protein with 9 amino acids. It also produced very low minimizers for a protein with 5 amino acids, however, these were not obtained consistently.

Reference-contexts: Apart from that, the potential energy function is known to have many local minimizers and finding the global minimizer among those is a challenging problem. For proteins, the speculation is that the potential energy function has at least 3 n local minima, n being the number of free variables <ref> [LS87] </ref> [WCMS88]. Therefore, the protein folding problem belongs to the class of NP-hard problems [CSW94]. <p> Recent work in the build-minimization area has focused on applying a Monte Carlo chain growth technique <ref> [LS87] </ref> [BGOV93] [Vel] to build the initial conformations before minimization. The conformation is built atom by atom or amino acid by amino acid, thereby placing the atom or amino acid with a certain probability at a certain position. This probability can be assigned any distribution.

Reference-contexts: Which local minimization technique is used does not significantly influence the results. Many techniques have been used for building the initial conformations, among which are random creation [Lev83], tree searching <ref> [LS88] </ref>, and dynamic programming [VD90]. However, as soon as larger proteins are addressed, these methods do not perform as well, due to either the randomness of the technique (the first method), or the fact that the search space becomes too large (the latter two methods).

Reference-contexts: The Water problem is to find the native state of a group of water molecules, whose potential energy is given by a sum of energy terms between pairs of water molecules. A global optimization approach to this problem has been described in [BDE + 93] and <ref> [Old93] </ref>. 3 Characteristic of both the Lennard-Jones and the Water problem is that their potential energy functions have lots of local minimizers, many near the global minimum. <p> In the last section we describe how its parallel implementation influences the algorithm. 4.1 The Lennard-Jones And The Water Algorithms The basis for our new global optimization algorithm is formed by the algorithms developed for the Lennard-Jones problem [BES92] and the Water problem [BDE + 93] <ref> [Old93] </ref>. These algorithms are reviewed briefly in this section. The Lennard-Jones and the Water problem are very similar. Both problems have a potential energy function that is partial separable. <p> Eventually, the best minimizer in the list of full-dimensional local minimizers should be the global minimum. This algorithm has been implemented on a parallel machine, and is exhaustively described in [BDE + 93] and <ref> [Old93] </ref>. 4.2 Outline Of The New Algorithm If we take a look at the protein folding problem, it becomes clear that the Water algorithm as it is can not be applied. The main reason is the chain structure of a protein.

However, as O'Toole and Panagiotopoulos point out <ref> [OP92] </ref>, the results obtained by Skolnick and Kolinski are obtained by biasing the objective function to have certain residues take on certain conformations.

Reference-contexts: Our algorithm has not been designed with this specific parallel machine in mind. Instead, we have tried not to be bound to a particular machine at all. Therefore, we have chosen to let processes communicate through the P4 communications library (version 1.3 <ref> [P4] </ref>). This is a library that is portable across many different parallel (super)computers. Our implementation of the new algorithm should therefore be easy to adapt to new computers. Some parts of the algorithm are implemented in the programming language FORTRAN.

Reference-contexts: Both algorithms are concerned only with the classification of the secondary structure of each amino acid in the protein, and will be discussed briefly below. 3.2.1 The Chou & Fasman Algorithm The Chou & Fasman algorithm <ref> [PF89] </ref> is a statistical algorithm. Using X-ray crystallograhic technology, Chou and Fasman examined structures of a number of proteins in their native states, and tabulated the number of occurrences of a given amino acid in an ff-helix, a fi-sheet, and random coil. <p> These conformational parameters are essentially measures of a given amino acid's preference to be found in ff-helix, fi-sheet, or random coil. Based on these parameters, Chou and Fasman formulated a set of empirical rules for predicting protein structure (page 394, <ref> [PF89] </ref>). Using these rules, one is able to predict the secondary 7 structure of a protein with an accuracy of about 50 percent. The limited accuracy of the predictions is believed to be due to the relatively small number of proteins from which the conformational parameters are calculated.

Reference-contexts: to take too much time to be a serious candidate for finding the native state of larger proteins. 3.4 Alternative Methods Besides the prediction and global optimization methods, research efforts towards solving the protein folding problem over the past years have resulted in a wide variety of approaches [BHW87] [BG85] <ref> [PS87] </ref> [GLSW92] [HGSA91]. Although some of these methods seem to be promising, researchers have paid more attention to two other types of methods. The first type combines a smart initial protein building phase with an energy minimization phase.

Reference-contexts: If the training set is a representative subset of the total set, the network is expected to behave correctly for cases that were not included in the training set as well. Qian and Sejnowski <ref> [QS88] </ref> were among the first to use a neural network to predict the secondary structure of a protein. Their neural network consists of 17 input units, 40 hidden units, and 3 output units. Each output unit represents one of the possible secondary structures: ff-helix, fi-sheet, or random coil.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, finding the global minimum, and consequently the native state, is a very hard problem. 2.3 The Protein Folding Problem A problem that is closely related to the cluster problems mentioned above, is the problem that will be addressed in this thesis: the protein folding problem [CD93] <ref> [Ric91] </ref>. The protein folding problem is defined in [Anf73] as the problem of finding the native state of a protein in its normal physiological milieu. As in the cluster problems, this is believed to be a unique state. <p> The backbone is the same for each amino acid, whereas each of the amino acids has a unique side chain. The amino acid sequence of a protein is called its primary structure. Remarkably, this primary structure defines the native or folded state of the protein completely <ref> [Ric91] </ref>. However, the rules according to which the protein folds are not discovered yet, and are often referred to as `the second half of the genetic code', which implies that the problem of finding these rules is a very hard problem.

We will not go into the details of this process. For an excellent description the reader is referred to <ref> [SES89] </ref> and [SS92]. After the small scale global optimization, each process in the group, including the foreman, keeps on doing full-dimensional local minimizations until no more small scale global minimizers need to be polished. Each worker then sends the results of the full-dimensional local minimization to the foreman.

Reference-contexts: Research is still going on in determining whether a protein folds through a single sequential pathway [Cre88], or whether there is no unique folding pathway <ref> [SK90] </ref>. It has even been proposed that a protein folds like humans solve a jigsaw puzzle, with multiple routes to a single solution [HD85]. <p> If the energy is higher, the new configuration is accepted with a certain |low| probability. This process is analogous to the Simulated Annealing process (see 3.3.1). The lattice based search method was pioneered by Chan and Dill [CD93] and it was refined by Skolnick and Kolinski <ref> [SK90] </ref> [SK91]. They report some good results.

Reference-contexts: A subset of these was used to train the network; the rest were used to test the network. This resulted in a performance of about 64 percent correct predictions. Based on these experiments, various other neural networks were tried [HK89] [KCL90] <ref> [SLX92] </ref>, but none of them was able to substantially improve the performance. This seems to be due to the same reasons as the Chou & Fasman algorithm: the limited size of the training set and the influence of tertiary structure on secondary structure.

For the protein of size 20, our results are in agreement with [WC90] and [BGOV93]. Despite the fact that the second phase does not improve over the first phase, the protein of size 30 is not in its global minimum yet.

Reference-contexts: The best known build-minimization method is the one developed by Vasquez and Scheraga <ref> [VS85] </ref>. They build their initial protein conformations using a simple buildup procedure. Starting with the conformations of individual amino acids, they build dipeptides (a structure consisting of two amino acids) by combining the best individual conformational states.

Reference-contexts: If a physical system is melted and then cooled slowly, the entire arrangement can be made to produce the most stable (crystalline) arrangement, and not get trapped in a local minimum <ref> [WC90] </ref>. Given the function to optimize, and initial values for the free variables, simulated annealing starts at a high |artificial| temperature. While cooling the temperature slowly, it repeatedly chooses a subset of the free variables and changes these variables by random numbers. <p> Throughout this process, the temperature becomes lower and lower, until eventually the variables do not change anymore. Then, the function is presumably at its global minimum. This approach has been used by Wilson and co-workers to find the native state of several proteins [WCMS88] <ref> [WC90] </ref>. Their results are quite encouraging. They are able to find the native state of most of the smaller proteins (2 to 10 amino acids), using the AMBER potential energy function. <p> The values of the free dihedral angles of the proteins of size 3 and 5 are equal to the ones listed in [HGSA91]. The best minimizer we found for the protein of size 10 is in a perfect ff-helical shape, which is in accordance with the results presented in <ref> [WC90] </ref> and the predictions made in [Vel] and [BGOV93].

Despite the fact that the second phase does not improve over the first phase, the protein of size 30 is not in its global minimum yet. <p> The resulting minimizer is a perfect ff-helix. The ends of the conformation are in a correct shape as well, no extra work needs to be done there. <ref> [WC90] </ref> reports that they found most of their best conformation to be in ff-helical shape, which is a clear indication that the whole protein in the native state should be in this shape. <p> Their algorithm was not able to find the native state; however, our algorithm shows that the native state of poly (40-Ala) is purely ff-helical. Poly (58-Ala) is the most interesting case. Weili and Cui <ref> [WC90] </ref>, using their simulated annealing algorithm, find ff-helical structures for poly (L-Ala) up to 80 amino-acids. However, Head-Gordon and Stillinger [HGS92] show that for poly (58-Ala) a lower minimizer exists: two parallel ff-helices, connected by a fi-bend.
