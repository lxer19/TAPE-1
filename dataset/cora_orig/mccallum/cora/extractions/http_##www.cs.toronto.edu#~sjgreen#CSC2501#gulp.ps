Reference-contexts: As such, UBG is not a theory of grammar but rather a formalism in which theories of grammar can be expressed. Such theories include functional unification grammar, lexical-functional grammar <ref> (Kaplan and Bresnan 1982) </ref>, generalized phrase structure grammar (Gazdar et al. 1986), head-driven phrase structure grammar (Pollard and Sag 1987, 1994), and others. UBGs use context-free grammar rules in which the nonterminal symbols are accompanied by sets of features.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, the cut (!) interferes with order-independence by blocking alternatives that would otherwise succeed. More commonplace predicates such as write, is, and == lack order-independence because they behave differently depending on whether their arguments are instantiated at the time of execution. Colmerauer's Prolog II <ref> (Giannesini et al. 1986) </ref> avoids some of these difficulties by allowing the programmer to postpone tests until a variable becomes instantiated, whenever that may be. 2.7 Building structures and moving data Declarative unification-based rules do more than just pass information up and down the tree.

Reference-contexts: The index of the verb's subject (arg1) is that of the NP mentioned in this rule. 28 Other rules do comparable amounts of work, and space precludes explaining them in detail here. <ref> (See Johnson and Klein 1985, 1986 for further explanation.) </ref> By unifying appropriate in and out features, the rules perform a complex computation in an order-independent way. 4.4 Left-corner parsing GULP is not tied to Prolog's built-in DCG parser. It can be used with any other parser implemented in Prolog.
