Abstract: Many robot applications require mobility in constrained spaces and a high degree of flexibility. This paper describes the development of an autonomous serpentine robot. This robot is a 12 degree of freedom, untethered, hyper-redundant planar robot, named Kaa. Experiments were conducted in its application to mobility tasks that would be useful in locomotion among parallel pipe structures similar to those found in industrial plants. Kaa utilizes a behavior control system. Unlike classical approaches, that decompose the control system functionally, behavior control approaches decompose the control system by task. This control scheme requires very little computation; Kaa uses two 8-bit, 1 MIP microprocessors with a total of 36 Kbytes of memory. Only simple tactile sensing is employed; the distances between objects in the environment and the robot are neither implicitly modeled nor explicitly sensed by the robot. The behavior control system developed allowed this robot to reliably perform complex autonomous mobility and manipulation tasks with limited computation and sensing resources. There are many applications for robots where a high degree of flexibility is desirable. While a manipulator arm requires only six degrees of freedom to reach any point in a workspace, there is little or no choice with respect to the position each joint occupies in space. This limitation decreases the usefulness of such a device in the presence of many obstacles or in a confined work space. An ideal manipulator consisting of a string of a virtually infinite number of degrees of freedom of zero diameter would avoid this limitation. Many practical hyper-redundant robots have been proposed and In many cases there are practical problems that render serpentine designs of limited use. In some implementations, one end of the robot is stationary, limiting the reach of these robots to a sphere with the radius equal to the fully extended length of the robot. Also, due to the redundant nature of the serpentine design, the inverse kinematics of the robot are non-determinate and solutions to specific problems can be complex. In almost all cases the systems are not autonomous, they carry neither power nor computer control on board. Our interest in serpentine robots stemmed from the specific application of the external inspection of pipes that commonly occur in industrial plants. A typical pipe structure is shown in figure 1. Such a structure is characterized by pipes arranged with narrow irregular, indeterminate spacing that cannot be readily modeled. Often there are numerous layers of such pipes. In case of one heat exchanger used inside a nuclear power plant, there were 1024, 1 pipes spaced less than 3 apart (center to center). However, there is some regularity to these structures which can be exploited. For example, all the pipes have an essentially circular cross-section and many are arranged parallel to each other in a planar fashion. Such structures are typically inspected manually. Traditional manipulators are not suitable for this inspection task as they suffer from the same limitations as humans with respect to reach.

In Kaa, a simple set of behaviors implements a robust grasping action. Objects of various sizes and shapes and at various positions along the arm can be grasped. Each joint is controlled by a set of processes.
