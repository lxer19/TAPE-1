Abstract: An implicit premise of existing routing methods is that the routing topology must correspond to a tree (i.e., it does not contain cycles). In this paper we investigate the consequences of abandoning this basic axiom, and instead we allow routing topologies that correspond to arbitrary graphs (i.e., where cycles are allowed). We show that non-tree routing can significantly improve signal propagation delay, reduce signal skew, and afford increased reliability with respect to open faults that may be caused by manufacturing defects and electro-migration. Simulations on uniformly-distributed nets indicate that depending on net size and technology parameters, our non-tree routing construction reduces maximum sourse-sink SPICE delay by an average of up to 62%, and reduces signal skew by an average of up to 63%, as compared with Steiner routing. Moreover, up to 77% of the total wirelength in non-trees can tolerate an open fault without disconnecting the circuit.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recent advances in VLSI technology have steadily improved chip packing densities. As feature sizes decrease, device switching speeds tend to increase; however, thinner wires have higher resistance, causing signal propagation delay through the interconnect to increase <ref> [1] </ref>. Thus, interconnection delay has a greater impact on circuit speed, being responsible for up to 70% of the clock cycle in the design of dense, high-performance circuits [19]. In light of this trend, performance-driven routing has become central to the design of leading-edge digital systems [14].

Reference-contexts: Because of its relatively simple form, Elmore delay can be calculated in O (k) time [18]. However, while the basic Elmore delay model outlined above applies only to tree topologies, Chan and Karplus have extended it to RC meshes <ref> [7] </ref>. Their method partitions the graph into a spanning tree and a set of m additional edges, then adds the extra edges back, updating the Elmore delay at each step. This increases the time complexity of the Elmore delay calculation to O (k m). <p> This increases the time complexity of the Elmore delay calculation to O (k m). We use this method of delay calculation for general RC meshes in our approximation heuristic for the ORG problem (note that the work of <ref> [7] </ref> proposes a delay estimator but does not give a specific routing method). Although the ORG problem formulation seeks to optimize delay, our solution below has additional benefits as well. <p> Steiner points are allowed as junctures in the routing, in order to afford further opportunity for both delay and wirelength optimization, and we use the delay estimation method of <ref> [7] </ref> to guide our search inside the inner loop of this construction. <p> We ran trials on sets of 100 random nets for each of several net sizes, with pin locations uniformly distributed in a square layout region. Although internally the LDRG method uses the extension of the Elmore delay formula to graphs <ref> [7] </ref>, for greater accuracy and realism, we used SPICE3e2 [17] to evaluate the performance of the actual routings produced by LDRG. 5 We used SPICE parameters that are representative of typical MOSIS 0:8, 1:2 and 2:0 CMOS IC processes, as well as a typical MCM technology (see Table 1).

Reference-contexts: For example, routings produced by our algorithm also have substantially reduced skew (i.e., maximum difference in signal propagation delay between any two terminals), which is important since a large signal skew diminishes the system performance <ref> [8] </ref>. Moreover, non-tree routings produced by our method afford circuit reliability in the sense that they are able to tolerate open faults due to manufacturing defects and electro-migration.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, we would like to compute and optimize delay according to the complete physical attributes of the circuit. To this end, we could use the circuit simulator SPICE <ref> [17] </ref>, which is generally regarded as the best available tool for obtaining a precise, complete measure of interconnect delay. 3 Unfortunately, SPICE delay is too computationally prohibitive to evaluate during the routing phase of layout, and we are thus compelled to seek other alternatives. <p> We ran trials on sets of 100 random nets for each of several net sizes, with pin locations uniformly distributed in a square layout region.
