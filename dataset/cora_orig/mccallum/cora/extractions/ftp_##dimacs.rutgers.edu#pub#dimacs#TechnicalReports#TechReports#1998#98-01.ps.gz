Reference-contexts: Thus, among the maximal elements of M 000 n we can find e.g. B n of size 2 n , and the maximum independent sets of T n , which are known from coding theory (see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>) to be of size 3 n1 (an easy example being I = f (x 1 ; :::; x n )j P n Hence the maximal elements of M 000 n are not all of the same size.

Reference-contexts: Our claim, i.e. jV 1 j jV 2 j, will follow by Hall's theorem (see <ref> [2] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: In fact, there are several possible ways of associating hypergraphs to a Hamming space, each of which could be a matroid (for definitions see e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>.) Let us define M 0 n as the family of sets I T n contained in a minimal generator G I. <p> More directly, we can see that the closure operation does not satisfy the closure axioms of a matroidal system (see e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>), see e.g. the example in Figure 3. 6.2 Switching and alike Let G be a generator and L = fx; y; zg be a line in T n .
