Abstract: This paper presents three new results concerning credit-based ow control for ATM networks: (1) a simple and robust credit update protocol (CUP) suited for relatively inexpensive hardware/ software implementation; (2) automatic adaptation of credit buffer allocation for virtual circuits (VCs) sharing the same buffer pool; (3) use of credit-based ow control to improve the effectiveness of statistical multiplexing in minimizing switch memory. These results have been substantiated by analysis, simulation and implementation.

Reference-contexts: This switch will be operational in fall 1994. 2. Why Per VC Link-by-Link Flow Control? The Flow-Controlled Virtual Connections (FCVC) approach [11], using per VC, link-by-link ow control, is different from other proposals on congestion control (see, e.g., <ref> [2, 8, 15] </ref>). Our interest in FCVC is primarily due to its effectiveness in maximizing network utilization, controlling congestion, and implementing best-effort or ABR services. 2.1. Maximizing Network Utilization FCVC provides effective means of using fill-in traffic to maximize network utilization, as depicted in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: Measurements have shown that data [6, 13] and video [7] traffic often exhibit large bandwidth variations even over time intervals as small as 10 milliseconds. With the emergence of very high-bandwidth traffic sources such as high-speed host computers with 800-Mbps HIPPI network <ref> [3] </ref> interfaces, networks will experience further increases in load uctuations [10]. To utilize slack bandwidth in the presence of highly bursty traffic, fast congestion feedback is necessary.

Reference-contexts: In the fill-in process, various scheduling policies can be employed. For example, high-priority best-effort traffic can be used in the fill in before the low-priority one. For effective traffic fill in, fast congestion feedback for individual VCs is needed.

Reference-contexts: With the emergence of very high-bandwidth traffic sources such as high-speed host computers with 800-Mbps HIPPI network [3] interfaces, networks will experience further increases in load uctuations <ref> [10] </ref>. To utilize slack bandwidth in the presence of highly bursty traffic, fast congestion feedback is necessary. To illustrate the need of fast feedback or ow control for effective fill in, consider a simple case of maximizing the utilization of a link. <p> Performance simulation [12] has confirmed the effectiveness of FCVC in filling in traffic, and thus in maximizing network utilization. 2.2. Controlling Congestion Another reason for FCVC is congestion control. For high-speed networks, in addition to highly bursty traffic mentioned above, there is the problem of increased mismatches in bandwidth <ref> [10] </ref>. When the peak speed of links increases in a network, so may bandwidth mismatches in the network. For example, when a 1-Gbps link is added to a network which includes a 10-Mbps Ethernet, there will be two orders of magnitude difference in their speeds.

Reference-contexts: Any one user would be able to acquire as much network resources as are available at any given moment, and all users compete equally for the available bandwidth. An efficient way of implementing ow-controlled ATM networks is through the use of credit-based, per VC, link-by-link ow control <ref> [11] </ref>. This paper gives several new results related to the credit-based ow control. All the VCs are assumed to be under best-effort or ABR services, unless stated otherwise. The organization of the paper is as follows: First, motivations for per VC, link-by-link ow control are given. <p> Page 2 of 14 Mbps ports, currently under joint development by BNR and Harvard.

Let B VC = Targeted average bandwidth of the VC over time RTT, expressed as a percentage of the link bandwidth 1 (4) Then it can be shown <ref> [11] </ref> that to prevent data and credit underow, it suffices to choose N3 to be: N3 = B VC By increasing the N3 value, the VC can transport data cells at a proportionally higher bandwidth. (Section 6 shows how the N3 value of a VC can adapt automatically to the actual <p> value of a VC can adapt automatically to the actual bandwidth usage of the VC.) Because the new Credit_Balance is computed by subtracting the number of in-ight cells, E, from the received credit, there is no need for the receiver to reserve a buffer space (called the N1 zone in <ref> [11] </ref>) to hold these cells. The method is thus named N23 as it only needs buffer space for the N2 and N3 zones.

Reference-contexts: The cost of retransmit-ting dropped packets increases with both the bandwidth and size of the network, such that on nationwide gigabit networks the penalty is very high. By using link-by-link ow control, FCVC implements the required feedback at the fastest possible speed.

Reference-contexts: Under heavy congestion, when many VCs are congested, cells will be lost. This is illustrated by the conceptual load-loss curves <ref> [18] </ref> of Figure 11. While ow control with the full amount of memory to guarantee zero cell loss has an ideal load-loss curve, with reduced memory using statistical multiplexing there is still a large region of the load-loss curve which gives efficient operation.
