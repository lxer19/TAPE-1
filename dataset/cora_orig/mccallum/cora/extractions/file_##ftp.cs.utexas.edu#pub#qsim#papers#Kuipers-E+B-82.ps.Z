Abstract: The "Map in the Head" metaphor states that knowledge of large-scale space is isomorphic to the information stored in a graphical map: That is, corresponding operations are used to store and retrieve information. The purpose of this essay is to look carefully at the "Map in the Head" metaphor to see the limits of its applicability. There are two types of experimental results that are difficult to accommodate within this metaphor. First, instead of being integrated into a single map, spatial knowledge can fall into disconnected components, with little or no relation between the components. Second, knowledge of routes (and other spatial facts) may be represented asymmetrically, so that a route can be followed in one direction but not in the other. The first set of results leads us to replace the simple "Map in the Head" with a more complex and sophisticated metaphor including separate metrical and topological components. The second set of results suggests that even the more sophisticated "Map in the Head" is built from computational structures that occasionally reveal their nonmaplike properties. A computational model is presented for assimilating observations gathered during travel, first into a description of the particular route, then into representations for the topological and metrical features of the environment. fl The research described here was performed in part while the author was at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Support for the laboratory's artificial intelligence research is provided in part by the Advanced Research Project Agency of the Department of Defense under Office of Naval Research contract N00014-75-C-0643.

Reference-contexts: The reader may be able to recall similar effects, particularly on infrequently traveled or newly learned routes. Since this effect can be observed in route-learning experiments where the landmarks are equally visible from all directions <ref> (Hazen et al., 1978) </ref>, it Kuipers, Environment and Behavior 14: 202-220, 1982 9 cannot be explained by the "accidental" circumstance that key landmarks might be obscured when traveling in the reverse direction. Rather, the irreversibility of routes reflects fundamental properties of the way humans access stored information.

Reference-contexts: The attentive traveler, concentrating on the construction of a complete route description, is the exception rather than the rule. In general, com-monsense knowledge such as the cognitive spatial description functions in the background of many other processes that freely interrupt and disrupt its successful operation <ref> (Kuipers, 1979a) </ref>. Under these circumstances, the route description will frequently consist only of associations of the first kind (view ! action). <p> A given knowledge representation can be analyzed to determine which states of partial knowledge it supports, what resources are required to change from one to another, and hence how well it supports graceful degradation or graceful improvement <ref> (Kuipers, 1979a, 1979b) </ref>. Since there is great survival value in adequate performance under resource limitations, we can derive useful insights into the structure of human knowledge representations by considering these properties.

Reference-contexts: This interpretation gains support from developmental studies (Hardwick et al.,1976; Hart and Moore,1973; Hazel et al.,1978; Kosslyn et al.,1974; Piaget et al.,1960; Siegel and White, 1975) and from studies of individual differences <ref> (Lynch, 1960) </ref>, which encounter individuals or stages in which most spatial information consists of topological relations.

Reference-contexts: The atlas might even contain sheets drawn at different scales, so that the locations of points on one sheet can represent metrical relations between other entire sheets <ref> (cf. McDermott, 1980) </ref>. This view of the cognitive spatial description predicts two different kinds of distortions on sketch maps: those reflecting distortions within a particular sheet and those reflecting a distorted relationship between sheets. <p> As part of the cognitive spatial description, this proposal would require a description for each relative-position vector, whose parts would include a distance, a direction, and the frame of reference <ref> (cf. McDermott, 1980) </ref>. From a separately motivated study of mental imagery, Kosslyn and Shwartz (1977) propose representing relative positions by placing points on an internal two-dimensional array with a restricted scanning process. The frame of reference is implicit in the array.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a network of places and paths, linked by topological relations of connection and order, can be created from the sequence of views and actions. Problem-solving procedures, using well-known techniques for searching networks <ref> (Nilsson, 1980) </ref>, can use this network to solve route-finding problems.

Reference-contexts: But the sequence was usually correct, the map was rarely torn and sewn back together in another order. This continuity is necessary if the image is to be of any value [Lynch, 1960: 87]. The strict "Map in the Head" theorist <ref> (e.g., Tobler, 1975) </ref> interprets this observation to mean that the mapping between the inner and the outer geometry leaves topological relations invariant.

Reference-contexts: Experimental psychologists have also focused their attention almost uniformly on the "maplike" properties of the cognitive spatial description. Early Kuipers, Environment and Behavior 14: 202-220, 1982 5 work explicitly proposed that spatial knowledge consisted of an "imaginary map" (Trowbridge, 1913) or "field map" <ref> (Tolman, 1948) </ref> of the environment. Since the ethnographic work of Lynch (1960) in urban planning, and the developmental research of Piaget et al. (1960), many authors have recognized a distinction within the cognitive spatial description between "route maps" and "survey maps" as different types of spatial knowledge.
