Title: Spectral Techniques for Expander Codes  
Author: John D. Lafferty Daniel N. Rockmore 
Abstract: This paper introduces methods based on generalized Fourier analysis for working with a class of error-correcting codes constructed in terms of Cayley graphs. Our work is motivated by the recent results of Sipser and Spielman [15] showing graph expansion to be essential for efficient decoding of certain low-density parity-check codes. They leave open the problem of sub-quadratic encoding for this class of codes, and it is this problem that we address. We show that when the codes are constructed in terms of Cayley graphs, the symmetry of the graphs can be exploited by using the representation theory of the underlying group to devise a sub-quadratic encoding algorithm that, in the case where the group is PSL 2 (Z=qZ), requires O(n 4=3 ) operations, where n = O(q 3 ) is the block length. Our results indicate that this new class of codes may combine many of the strengths of two of the most powerful and successful, but previously disparate areas of coding theory: the class of cyclic codes where the rich algebraic structure yields a large collection of techniques for finding and manipulating the codes, and the class of low-density parity-check codes which have simple and efficient decoding algorithms and good asymptotic properties.

Reference-contexts: The applicability of representation theory is not fully recognized, and in particular, the hybrid polynomial/abelian Fourier transform method that is adopted in this paper does not seem to extend readily to more general groups. Alon et al. <ref> [1] </ref> use the explicit Ramanujan graphs of PSL 2 (Z=qZ) to construct low rate codes that are not directly related to the Cayley codes we use here.

Reference-contexts: In this paper the difficulties of working in the time domain, even for the simplest example of the dihedral group, are apparent. Representation theory is not proposed as an essential tool. The article of Beth <ref> [2] </ref> is one of the first to consider efficient Fourier transform algorithms for nonabelian groups, and the paper also suggests the connection with coding. Much is now known about the complexities of various groups, and understanding of the relevant algorithms is just now beginning to mature.

Reference-contexts: These algorithms often have similar complexities, but Fourier analysis can sometimes be used to obtain more efficient algorithms, and the intuition developed in the frequency domain is often quite powerful. An instructive example is the proof of the BCH bound using Fourier analysis <ref> [3] </ref>. It will be useful to recall the basic spectral techniques, since our generalized methods parallel them.

Reference-contexts: The use of random Cayley graphs|that is, graphs constructed by choosing random generators for the group|removes some of the restrictions on block length and subcode size that the explicit codes impose. As we showed in <ref> [5] </ref>, the expansion of a Cayley graph can be estimated efficiently by using Fourier analysis to calculate its spectrum. The spectral methods that we present here for this new class of low-density Cayley codes can be seen as generalized versions of spectral techniques for classical cyclic codes. <p> In particular, spectrum ((G; A)) = h [ spectrum This is the basic fact that we used in <ref> [5, 6] </ref> to investigate expanders for this group, and it is also the key idea behind our use of spectral methods for codes. <p> The analysis for the initialization stage is similar. For the group PSL 2 (Z=qZ), the irreducible representations occur as O (q) matrices of size O (q); see <ref> [5] </ref>. Thus, the encoding of be () takes O (q 4 ) operations, and using the results of [12], we have the same complexity for Fourier inversion. <p> Sketch of proof: Let the matrices s u = 0 1 0 1 be a fixed set of coset representatives of BnSL 2 (Z=qZ), which we identify with P 1 (F q ). In <ref> [5] </ref> we constructed the principal series representations of SL 2 (Z=qZ) by in ducing characters from B, and expressing these matri ces in terms of their action on fs u g. <p> Thus, c ffi A ( ) has non-zero entries precisely where the adjacency matrix of (P 1 (F q ); A) is non-zero; we refer to <ref> [5] </ref> for details. If (PSL 2 (Z=qZ); A) is a good expander, then (P 1 (F q ); A) is also a good expander since its spectral gap is at least as large.

Reference-contexts: These spectral expander codes emerge after choosing suitable bases for the representations. The group PSL 2 (Z=qZ) is central to our work because explicit expander codes can be constructed using the explicit Ramanujan graphs that are known for this group, and our previous work <ref> [6] </ref> indicates that random Cay-ley graphs for this group are good expanders. The use of random Cayley graphs|that is, graphs constructed by choosing random generators for the group|removes some of the restrictions on block length and subcode size that the explicit codes impose. <p> In particular, spectrum ((G; A)) = h [ spectrum This is the basic fact that we used in <ref> [5, 6] </ref> to investigate expanders for this group, and it is also the key idea behind our use of spectral methods for codes.

Reference-contexts: For arbitrary G, in many cases fast algorithms still exist, and in particular, for the projective special linear group PSL 2 (Z=qZ), recent work shows that we can accomplish both forward and inverse Fourier transforms in O (q 4 ) operations <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> The analysis for the initialization stage is similar.

The results of [16] go further and construct both linear time encodable and decodable codes by combining expander codes with encoding circuits based on superconcentrators; however the resulting codes have much weaker error correction properties. <p> Since these codes are attractive primarily for large block lengths, the quadratic encoding cost appears to make them impractical for many applications. The methods of <ref> [15] </ref>, however, use only the expansion properties of the explicit constructions. These graphs have additional structure since they are Cayley graphs of certain non-abelian groups. <p> We use a standard computational model in which a single multiplication and addition over F has unit cost. 2.3 Expanders and Cayley codes The construction of expander codes in <ref> [15] </ref> uses the same basic approach as [18], and results in a class of codes closely related to Gallager's low-density parity-check codes [4]. <p> The following theorem is a simple consequence of the definition of expansion <ref> [15] </ref>. Theorem 1 Let n;c;d be a (c; d)-regular bipartite on n vertices, with c &lt; d, and let S d be an error-correcting code of block length d, with relative minimum distance * and rate r. <p> As will be evident, our methods apply to both vertex codes C V (G; A; S) and edge codes C E (G; A; S). The explicit expander codes of <ref> [15] </ref> are constructed using Cayley graphs of the projective special linear group. The graphs used are the explicit family of expander graphs (the so-called Ramanujan graphs) constructed by Lubotzky, Phillips, and Sarnak [8], and independently by Margulis [11]. <p> 1)=2, then we have chords b G 0 ; b G 1 ; :::; b G ` ; b G 1 ; :::; b G ` for some `. 3.2 The algorithm We will now describe the encoding algorithm in some detail for Cayley edge codes since the results of <ref> [15] </ref> are obtained for this class. We fix a Cayley graph = (G; A). For an edge function f 2 E (F), we will let f (i) : G ! F denote the function f (i) (g) = f ((g; s 1 i g)). <p> Further improvements in FFT al gorithms for PSL 2 (Z=qZ) may well lead to a reduced complexity for this algorithm. 3.3 Systematic encoding The encoding algorithm we have outlined above for Cayley codes is nonsystematic. When used together with the time domain decoding procedure developed in <ref> [15] </ref>, this means that although the codeword c 2 E (F) may be decoded from the received vector in O (n) operations (or O (n log n) in the logarithmic cost model), the original information symbols can be recovered only after then taking a Fourier transform of c and reading off <p> Thus, the relations (7) define a spectral domain expander code, where the subcode may vary with each constraint. Remark 8 The existence of an analogous basis for the discrete series representations would show that the time domain decoding algorithm for expander codes studied in <ref> [15] </ref> can be carried out in the frequency domain, independently for each representation.
