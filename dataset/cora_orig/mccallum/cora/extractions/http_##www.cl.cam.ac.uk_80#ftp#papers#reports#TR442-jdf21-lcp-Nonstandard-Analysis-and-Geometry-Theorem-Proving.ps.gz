Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Isaac Newton's Philosophi Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy <ref> [1] </ref>), or Principia as it is usually called, was first published in 1687 and set much of the foundations of modern science. We now know that Newton's view of the world was only approximate but the laws and proofs he developed are still relevant and used in our everyday world.

Reference-contexts: In Newton's time, however, geometrical proofs were very much the norm. It follows that some of the lemmas of the Principia can be proved using just Euclidean geometry and we do so using our formalisation in Isabelle <ref> [2] </ref> of GTP rules proposed by Chou et al. [3, 4]. According to De Gandt [5] many of Newton's propositions and lemmas, however, do go beyond the boundaries of traditional Euclidean geometry in important respects such as the presence of motion and the admission of the infinitely small.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, 1 the style of his proofs is notoriously convoluted due to the use of a repetitive, connected prose. Whiteside <ref> [6] </ref> notes the following: I do not deny that this hallowed ikon of scientific history is far from easy to read. . . we must suffer the crudities of the text as Newton resigned it to us when we seek to master the the Principia's complex mathematical content.

Reference-contexts: Below we shall describe how we used the concept of the infinitesimal from Nonstandard Analysis (NSA) <ref> [7] </ref> to help formalise the notion of infinitely small geometric quantities. Our initial aim is to study the geometric proofs of the Principia and investigate ways of mechanising them. We want to use some of the methods already developed for GTP in our own proofs.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, as mentioned previously, geometric theorems and lemmas that hold at the infinitesimal level do not necessarily hold in general and we now have tools to prove them. 4 A Formalisation of Geometry in Isabelle There exist efficient techniques for GTP| many of which, though extremely powerful, are highly algebraic <ref> [8] </ref>. These have been developed mostly for automated proofs, which are usually long and extremely difficult to understand. They consist mostly of a series of algebraic manipulations of polynomials that could not be farther from the the style of reasoning employed by Newton. <p> This represents a return to the original and more traditional ways of geometry theorem proving that had been superseded by the more powerful algebraic methods based mainly on Wu's characteristic set method <ref> [8] </ref> and the Grobner basis method [15]. Unfortunately there are several drawbacks associated with the use of these algebraic techniques: they are com-putationally intensive and produce long proofs that do not have clear geometric meaning since they are manipulations of polynomials obtained by coordinatisa-tion of points in the diagrams.

Reference-contexts: of Chou's lemmas [3, 4] obtained through the combination of various rules and used to help the automatic search have been verified in Isabelle. 11 6.3 Problem Solving in Mechanics There has been some interest in the past in problem solving in mechanics in the GTP community where, interestingly, Wu <ref> [9] </ref> algebraically proved Newton's Laws of Gravitation and even, with somewhat more difficulty, automatically derived them from Kepler's Laws (which Newton actually proved in the Principia). There is also Novak, who implemented several systems to do problem solving in classical physics with the help of diagrams [16].

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 (Kepler's law of Equal Areas) for an example 2 3 Introducing the Infinitesimal For a long time, the mathematical community has had a strong aversion to the notion of an infinitesimal (Bishop Berkeley <ref> [10] </ref> wrote a famous and vitriolic attack). This was historically due to the incorrect and informal use of infinitesi-mals in the development of the calculus.

Reference-contexts: Notions of finite and infinite numbers are also defined and we have proved many algebraic properties about them as well. We follow the definitions and mechanically-proved the theorems given in section 1A of Keisler <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Definition 3.2 x; y 2 R fl are said to be infinitely close , x y if jx yj is infinitesimal. It is easily proved that x is an infinitesimal if and only if x 0 and that we have defined an equivalence relation above. Ballantyne and Bledsoe <ref> [12] </ref> observe: The relation now solves the problem Leibnitz encountered in that he was forced to make his infinitesimals simultaneously equal and different from zero. If one replaces the identity relation with the relation then all is well. <p> Ballantyne and Bledsoe <ref> [12] </ref> implemented a prover using nonstandard techniques in the late seventies. Their work basically involved substituting any theorem in the reals R by its analogous in the extended reals R fl and proving it in this new setting.

Suppes and Chuaqui [13] have proposed a framework for doing proofs in NSA and Bedrax has implemented a prototype for a simplified version of Suppes-Chuaqui system called Infmal <ref> [14] </ref>. Infmal is implemented in Common Lisp and contains the various axioms (logical, algebraic and infinitesimal) required by the deduction system and extensions to the usual arithmetic operations. Unfortunately, Infmal is a simple experiment and though interactive is rather limited in the proofs it can carry out.
