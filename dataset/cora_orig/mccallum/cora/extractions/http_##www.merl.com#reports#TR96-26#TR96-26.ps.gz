Reference-contexts: But it is not to be and he falls on his face, defeated. As the song finishes, the table struts away without so much as a backwards glance. 3 Tools Our particular approach to automated motion synthesis is described in detail elsewhere <ref> [1] </ref>. Here we consider only the inputs required by our system. One input comprised the physical models for the characters. For the end table we used a compact, symmetric mass-spring lattice. The chair was modeled by adding a back and supporting springs to the top of the cube.
