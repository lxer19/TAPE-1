Title: An Instructor's Assistant for Team-Training in dynamic multi-agent virtual worlds.

Abstract: Teams of people operating in highly dynamic, multi-agent environments must learn to deal with rapid and unpredictable turns of events. Simulation-based training environments inhabited by synthetic agents can be effective in providing realistic but safe settings in which to develop the skills these environments require. However such training environments present a problem for the instructor who must evaluate and control rapidly evolving training sessions. We address the instructors' problem with a pedagogical agent called the PuppetMaster. The PuppetMaster manages a network of spy agents that report on the activities in the simulation in order to provide the instructor with an interpretation and situation-specific analysis of student behavior. The approach used to model student teams is to structure the state space into an abstract situation-based model of behavior that supports interpretation in the face of missing information about agent's actions and goals.

Reference-contexts: This presents a problem for approaches to pedagogical agents and intelligent tutoring that attempt to model students based on detailed plan matching (e.g., [12]), model tracing (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>) or plan recognition (e.g., [5]) based on a step-by-step analysis of actions.

Model tracing <ref> [1] </ref> differs somewhat from this approach in that a production system is used as a cognitive model of the method and the events generated by its execution behavior are matched to the student's behavior.

Reference-contexts: The various entities interacting in this simulation environment can include teams of students in tank simulators as well as synthetic forces (semi-autonomous forces) generated by software such as the ModSAF (Modular Semi-Autonomous Forces) program <ref> [2] </ref>. 3 In a typical platoon exercise, there are four tank simulators, each manned by four students, and approximately fifty synthetic forces.

Reference-contexts: In creating these environments, considerable effort is often expended so that the simulated world more faithfully mirrors the real world in which the acquired skill must be employed. This concern for the fidelity of the training simulation has a long standing tradition (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>). Training teams of people to operate in dynamic multi-agent settings presents special challenges, however. The concern for fidelity has led to training environments that are in turn very dynamic.

Our work is somewhat more loosely related to plan recognition (e.g., <ref> [13, 5] </ref> and agent tracking (e.g., [15]). Plan recognition involves inferring an agent's unknown plan based on their actions. Our pedagogical agent work differs in several ways. The intent is not to infer a plan. We have knowledge of the abstract plan.

Reference-contexts: We are studying the implications of applying situation spaces to more complex teams of students where individual students would be best modeled as distinct situation spaces.
