Abstract: This paper describes algorithms for the animation of men and women performing three dynamic athletic behaviors: running, bicycling, and vaulting. We animate these behaviors using control algorithms that cause a physically realistic model to perform the desired maneuver. For example, control algorithms allow the simulated humans to maintain balance while moving their arms, to run or bicycle at a variety of speeds, and to perform a handspring vault. Algorithms for group behaviors allow a number of simulated bicyclists to ride as a group while avoiding simple patterns of obstacles. We add secondary motion to the animations with spring-mass simulations of clothing driven by the rigid-body motion of the simulated human. For each simulation, we compare the computed motion to that of humans performing similar maneuvers both qualitatively through the comparison of real and simulated video images and quantitatively through the comparison of simulated and biomechanical data.

Reference-contexts: Many researchers in computer graphics have explored the difficult problems inherent in animating human motion. The Jack system developed at the University of Pennsylvania contains kinematic and dynamic models of humans based on biomechanical data <ref> [1] </ref>. It allows the interactive positioning of the body and has several built-in behaviors including balance, reaching and grasping, and walking and running behaviors that use generalizations of motion capture data [18].

Reference-contexts: The errors for the constraints are the relative accelerations, velocities, and positions of one body with respect to the other. The constraints are stabilized using Baumgarte stabilization <ref> [2] </ref>. Running Running is a cyclic behavior in which the legs swing fore and aft and provide support for the body in alternation. Because the legs perform different functions during the phases of the locomotion cycle, the muscles are used for different control actions at different times in the cycle.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, computational resources and an incomplete understanding of physical processes restrict the size and types of the passive systems that we are able to simulate. Several methods for physically based animation of cloth have been described in the literature ([7], [22], <ref> [3] </ref>, and [34]). Carignan [7] implemented a system that uses the motion of a kinematic human walker developed by Laurent [19] to drive the action of the cloth. Our approach is similar to that described by Terzopoulos and Fleischer [34].

Reference-contexts: The algorithm for group behaviors computes a desired position for each individual by averaging the location and velocity of its visible neighbors, a desired group velocity, and a desired position with respect to the visible obstacles. The details of this computation are presented in Brogan and Hodgins <ref> [4] </ref>. This desired position is then used as an input to the control algorithm for the bicyclist. The desired position is known only to the individual bicyclist and his navigational intent is communicated to the other cyclists only through their observation of his actions.

Reference-contexts: However, choreographing an animation with many bicyclists or runners would be difficult because the animator must ensure that they do not run into each other while moving as a group and avoiding obstacles. Building on Reynolds <ref> [29] </ref>, we implemented an algorithm that allows bicyclists to move as a group and to avoid simple configurations of obstacles on the terrain. The performance of the algorithm for a simulation of a bike race on a hill is shown in figure 5.

The points of contact between the feet and the ground, the bicycle wheels and the ground, and the gymnast's hands and the vault are modeled using constraints.

Similarly, the motion of splashing water is driven by the motion of a platform diver when it impacts the water ([24] and <ref> [35] </ref>). Ideally, all objects that do not have active control could be implemented in this fashion. Unfortunately, computational resources and an incomplete understanding of physical processes restrict the size and types of the passive systems that we are able to simulate.
