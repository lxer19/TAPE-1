Gersho, </author> <title> Efficient bit allocation for an arbitrary set of quantizers, </title> <journal> IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, </journal> <volume> vol. 36, no. 9, </volume> <pages> pp. 1445-1453, </pages> <month> Sept. </month> <year> 1988. </year>
Reference-contexts: The analyses yield necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality that lead to efficient bit-allocation algorithms. In Section 8, we describe an implementation of these algorithms within a software MPEG-2 encoder and present simulation results. 2 Previous Work Shoham and Gersho <ref> [1] </ref> have examined the budget-constrained bit-allocation problem in the context of a discrete set of independent quantizers. A bit-allocation algorithm based upon Lagrangian minimization is presented as a more efficient alternative to a well-known dynamic programming solution based upon the Viterbi Algorithm [2, 3]. <p> For a sequence of N pictures, we define N corresponding bit-production models ff 1 ; f 2 ; : : : ; f N g that map nominal quantization scale to bits: b i = f i (q i ), where f i : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 7! [l i ; u i ], with 0 l i &lt; u i . (We number pictures in encoding order and not temporal display order.) We require the models to have the following properties: 1. f i (0) = u i , 3. f i is continuous and <p> From these conditions, it follows that f i is invertible with q i = g i (b i ), where g i = f 1 i and g i : [l i ; u i ] 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. We note that g i is also continuous and monotonically decreasing. Although monotonicity does not always hold in practice, it is a generally accepted assumption. <p> In this section, we briefly describe their algorithm and show how it can be readily extended to perform lexicographic minimization. 10.1 Dynamic Programming The dynamic programming algorithm described in [45] is based on the Viterbi Algorithm described in <ref> [1] </ref> for solving the budget-constrained bit-allocation problem. To handle the additional buffer constraints, the buffer fullness is recorded at each state instead of the total number of bits used so far; for CBR coding, the number of bits used can be determined from the buffer fullness.

Reference-contexts: Although it only solves the simple budget-constrained allocation problem, this work lays the foundation for much of the ensuing work on optimal bit allocation. Optimal budget-constrained bit allocation in a dependent-coding setting is examined in <ref> [4] </ref>. A 5 parametric rate-distortion model is proposed for intraframe coding and forward predictive coding. The model has an exponential form and is motivated by theoretical rate-distortion results for stationary Gaussian sources.

Reference-contexts: However, they do not refine the minimax solutions to further minimize the second highest distortion, and so on. The minimax solution is obtained by equating the distortion among pictures. Budget-constrained minimax bit allocation for dependent coding is also considered in <ref> [5] </ref>. The authors provide a minimax solution by first showing how to find a minimum-rate solution given a maximum distortion and then using a bisection search to find the maximum distortion corresponding to the desired rate.

Reference-contexts: However, the bisection search is not guaranteed to converge in a finite number of iterations. The problem of optimal bit allocation in a buffered video coder is first presented in <ref> [6] </ref>. The authors consider video coding with CBR buffer constraints and formulate bit allocation as an integer-programming problem. They assume a finite set of quantization scales, an integral number of coded bits, and independent coding. The problem is optimally solved using a dynamic programming algorithm based upon the Viterbi Algorithm. <p> The problem is optimally solved using a dynamic programming algorithm based upon the Viterbi Algorithm. Heuristic methods based upon Lagrangian minimization and other ad-hoc techniques are proposed to provide more efficient, but sub-optimal, solutions. The discrete optimization framework of <ref> [6] </ref> is extended in [7] to handle dependent coding. Except for a simple illustrative case, computing an optimal bit allocation under the dependent framework requires time and space exponential in the number of coding units. A heuristic pruning technique is proposed to reduce the number of states considered. <p> A heuristic pruning technique is proposed to reduce the number of states considered. However, the effectiveness of the heuristic depends upon the rate-distortion characteristics of the source. The work in <ref> [6] </ref> is further extended in [8] to include transmission over a variable-bit-rate channel 6 with delay constraints. Besides buffer and delay constraints, the authors also consider constraints imposed by several policing mechanisms proposed for ATM networks. <p> As with hybrid rate control, reverse dynamic programming can be used to speed up the reallocation. 8.6 Related Work Several heuristic methods have been proposed in <ref> [6] </ref> to reduce the complexity as compared to an optimal bit allocation based on the Viterbi algorithm. A Lagrangian optimization technique is applied to recompute an allocation incrementally for each picture, similar to the technique described in Section 8.3.2.

Reference-contexts: In the construction of the trellis used by the Viterbi Algorithm, states that violate the various constraints are discarded. Unlike our framework, there is no explicit constraint on the total number of bits used. Joint control of encoder and channel rate is also considered in <ref> [9] </ref>. Instead of considering global optimality, this work focuses on real-time control algorithms. An algorithm is proposed that separates rate control into a "short-term" process and a "long-term" process. The long-term rate control sets a base quantization scale Q s called the sequence quantization parameter.

Reference-contexts: Short-term rate control is applied when the upper bound on encoder rate needs to be enforced. Several methods are proposed for performing short-term rate control. In <ref> [10] </ref>, a model relating bits, distortion, and quantization scale is derived for block-transform video coders. Assuming a stationary Gaussian process, the authors derive a bit-production model containing transcendental functions. The model is applied to control the frame rate of motion-JPEG and H.261 video coders. <p> In essence, this method implements limited lookahead with a sliding window, similar to the technique described in Section 8.5. The authors also describe the heuristic of recomputing a allocation only when the buffer reaches predefined threshold levels. In <ref> [10] </ref>, a bit-production model is derived for block-transform coders based on rate-distortion theory and assuming a stationary Gaussian process. The model is applied for VBR coding with motion JPEG and H.261 coders.

Reference-contexts: In this way, the nominal quantization parameter Q would correspond directly to the perceived distortion and can serve as the object for optimization.

Where quantization noise is less noticeable, such as in highly-textured regions, we can use a larger value for ff I than regions where quantization noise is more noticeable, such as in relatively uniform areas.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we consider constraints on the number of bits produced for each picture that follow from analysis of the VBV.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, given that the maximum Q i is minimized, we want the second largest Q i to be as small as possible, and so on. This is referred to as lexicographic optimality or lexicographic minimax in the literature (e.g., <ref> [30] </ref>). We define a sorted permutation DEC on Q s such that for DEC (Q s ) = hq j 1 ; q j 2 ; : : : ; q j N i, we have q j 1 q j 2 q j N .

Reference-contexts: We conclude that s has the same allocation as any optimal allocation, and therefore the optimal allocation is unique. 2 Detailed proofs of Lemma 2 and Theorem 1 can be found in <ref> [31] </ref>. 4.2 Related Work Conditions similar to the switching conditions of Theorem 1 have been described in [32] for optimal buffered bit allocation under a minimum sum-distortion criterion and assuming independent convex rate-distortion functions. <p> Similarly, if G i;j &gt; x k+1 , the operating point must lie between two control points with higher indices. Since there are a fixed number of control points, we can compute G i;j in constant time with linear-time preprocessing. 8.2.3 Piecewise-Hyperbolic Model In earlier experiments <ref> [43, 31] </ref>, we found that the linear-spline model gave consistently better results than the simple hyperbolic model. This is because the linear-spline model has more parameters and can better approximate a picture's rate-distortion characteristics over a wider range of quantization.

Reference-contexts: We conclude that s has the same allocation as any optimal allocation, and therefore the optimal allocation is unique. 2 Detailed proofs of Lemma 2 and Theorem 1 can be found in [31]. 4.2 Related Work Conditions similar to the switching conditions of Theorem 1 have been described in <ref> [32] </ref> for optimal buffered bit allocation under a minimum sum-distortion criterion and assuming independent convex rate-distortion functions. In this work, the Lagrange multiplier method is used to find a bit allocation that is optimal within a convex-hull approximation.

Reference-contexts: In this work, the Lagrange multiplier method is used to find a bit allocation that is optimal within a convex-hull approximation. The optimal vector of Lagrange multipliers consists of constant-valued segments that increase (decrease, respectively) only when the decoder buffer is full (empty, respectively). In <ref> [33, 34] </ref>, the theory of majorization [35] is applied to reduce the variability in transmission rate for stored video. <p> By plotting transmitted bits versus time, we can view a transmission schedule as a curve in 2D space. Buffering constraints are manifested as rectilinear barriers. As shown in <ref> [33] </ref>, an optimally smooth transmission schedule follows the shortest path that does not cross the barriers. A lexicographically-optimal bit allocation does not have such a simple geometric interpretation since the relationship between the nominal quantization scale and rate is non-linear.

Conditions analogous to the switching conditions of Theorem 1 exist in the rate smoothing context <ref> [34] </ref>: the decoder buffer must be full when there is an increase in the transmission rate and empty when there is a decrease. To apply the linear-time algorithm to lexicographic bit allocation, we equate a constant-bit-rate (constant-slope) segment in the rate-smoothing problem with a constant-Q segment in the bit-allocation problem.

Reference-contexts: The optimal vector of Lagrange multipliers consists of constant-valued segments that increase (decrease, respectively) only when the decoder buffer is full (empty, respectively). In [33, 34], the theory of majorization <ref> [35] </ref> is applied to reduce the variability in transmission rate for stored video. In this setting, the problem is to determine a feasible transmission schedule by which a pre-compressed video bitstream can be transmitted over a communications channel to the decoder without underflowing or overflowing the decoder buffer.

Reference-contexts: Examples of other functional forms for f i with a closed-form solution for G i;j can be found in <ref> [36] </ref>. Of course, we need to insure that the models are monotonically decreasing. Since VBV verification and constant-Q calculation can be done in constant time with linear-time preprocessing, computing Top k and Bot k takes O (k) time.

Reference-contexts: This is especially critical in storage applications, where the storage capacity, and not the transfer rate, is the limiting factor. Another important application of VBR video coding is for multiplexing multiple video bitstreams over a CBR channel <ref> [38] </ref>. In this application, statistical properties of the multiple video sequences may allow more VBR bitstreams with a given peak rate R to be multiplexed onto the channel than CBR bitstreams coded at a constant rate of R.

We implemented the lexicographic rate-control algorithms within the software encoder provided by the MPEG-2 Simulation Group <ref> [39] </ref>. The piecewise-hyperbolic model of Section 8.2.3 is used in conjunction with the non-linear quantizer scale of MPEG-2.

Reference-contexts: Lin, Ortega, and Kuo [41] have proposed using cubic-spline interpolation models of rate and distortion in conjunction with a gradient-based rate-control algorithm <ref> [42] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, if G i;j &gt; x k+1 , the operating point must lie between two control points with higher indices. Since there are a fixed number of control points, we can compute G i;j in constant time with linear-time preprocessing. 8.2.3 Piecewise-Hyperbolic Model In earlier experiments <ref> [43, 31] </ref>, we found that the linear-spline model gave consistently better results than the simple hyperbolic model. This is because the linear-spline model has more parameters and can better approximate a picture's rate-distortion characteristics over a wider range of quantization.
