Reference-contexts: These codes were called canonical by Goppa [5, section 10]. For every effective divisor A there exists a divisor G with support disjoint from the support of D, which is equivalent with D + A, by the independance of valuations <ref> [1] </ref>. But it is not true that for every divisor G of degree at least n there exists an effective divisor A such that G is equivalent to D + A. Lemma 2.10 Let G be equivalent with D + A, for some effective divisor A.

Reference-contexts: In fact the gonality is equal to m 1, which follows from Namba [12] in characteristic zero, and Homma [6] in general. Coppens <ref> [2] </ref> considered the gonality of plane curves with nodes. If the field of constants is algebraically closed, then t (X ) b (g + 3)=2c, by Brill-Noether theory, and equality holds for a general curve. The above inequality is not true over a finite field, as the following example shows.

Reference-contexts: Let G be a divisor on X of degree m. The code C L (D; G) is defined as the image of L (G) in F n q , under the evaluation map f 7! (f (P 1 ); : : : ; f (P n )). Goppa <ref> [5] </ref> showed that the functional code C L (D; G) has dimension at least m + 1 g and minimum distance at least n m in case m &lt; n. If moreover m &gt; 2g 2, then the dimension is equal to m + 1 g. <p> The number t (X ) is the minimal degree of a map from the curve to the projective line, also called the gonality of the curve. This was proved by Goppa <ref> [5, section 10] </ref> in the case a = 0, he called such codes canonical. It is easily seen that t (X ) N=(q + 1), where N is the number of rational points of the curve X . <p> Note that C L (D; G) = C (D; K A), for some canonical divisor K [18, Corollary 2.6]. So abundant codes of abundance zero are also of the form C (D; K), where K is a canonical divisor. These codes were called canonical by Goppa <ref> [5, section 10] </ref>. For every effective divisor A there exists a divisor G with support disjoint from the support of D, which is equivalent with D + A, by the independance of valuations [1]. <p> If moreover n + a &gt; 2g 2, then k = n + a g. Proof The special case a = 0 is treated by Goppa <ref> [5, section 10] </ref>. The statement about the minimum distance follows directly from Lemma 2.10 and 2.2. <p> Proposition 4.2 If there exists a curve over F q of genus g and gonality t with N rational points, then g log q ( i=0 N j where e = b (t 1)=2c. Proof This result is due to Goppa <ref> [5, section 10] </ref>. There exists an [N; k; d] code such that k N g and d t.

Reference-contexts: In this way we get a map from the curve to the projective line of degree at most m 1, so the gonality is at most m 1. In fact the gonality is equal to m 1, which follows from Namba [12] in characteristic zero, and Homma <ref> [6] </ref> in general. Coppens [2] considered the gonality of plane curves with nodes. If the field of constants is algebraically closed, then t (X ) b (g + 3)=2c, by Brill-Noether theory, and equality holds for a general curve.

Reference-contexts: This gives a contradiction with the definition of the gonality of X . 2 Corollary 2.3 t g + 1: Proof Over a finite field there exists a divisor of degree g + 1, see <ref> [11, Theorem 3.2] </ref>, and such a divisor has dimension at least 2, by the Riemann-Roch Theorem. Now the claim follows from Lemma 2.2. 2 Corollary 2.4 If X has a rational point and deg (E) t 1, then l (E) deg (E) + 2 t. <p> Definition 2.13 We call t the abundant designed minimum distance, and denote it by d A . Example 2.14 A specific case of an abundant code is studied in [14, Proposition 15]. There it is shown that the binary [7,4,3] Hamming code is canonical, see also <ref> [11, 5.7.1] </ref>. The curve used is a smooth plane curve of degree 4, hence of genus 3, which goes through all the 7 rational points of the projective plane.

Reference-contexts: In the corners, where the graphs of R TV Z and R GV meet, Vladut made a slight improvement, moreover he showed that there are codes, comming from curves, with parameters lying on the maximum of the above mentioned bounds, see [21, 3.4.11]. Later Pellikaan, Shen and van Wee <ref> [14] </ref> proved that every linear code can be represented with a curve, but if one imposes the condition m &lt; n, then long binary algebraic-geometric codes have information rate at most 1 2 . <p> If G is an abundant divisor, then the code C L (D; G) is called abundant. Remark 2.9 The name abundant refers to the fact that the degree of such divisors is at least n, whereas in Goppa's bound one assumes m &lt; n. In <ref> [14, Proposition 11] </ref> it is proved that binary AG codes (i.e. binary codes of the form C L (D; G) such that m &lt; n) of length longer than 13 have information rate smaller than 1=2. <p> Definition 2.13 We call t the abundant designed minimum distance, and denote it by d A .

Reference-contexts: Note that C L (D; G) = C (D; K A), for some canonical divisor K <ref> [18, Corollary 2.6] </ref>. So abundant codes of abundance zero are also of the form C (D; K), where K is a canonical divisor. These codes were called canonical by Goppa [5, section 10]. <p> It is known that every functional code C L (D; G) is also a residue code, i.e. of the form C (D; G 0 ), where G 0 = K + D G, for some canonical divisor K, see <ref> [18, Corollary 2.6] </ref>. Now we discuss the decoding of C (D; G).

Reference-contexts: If m &lt; n, then the Goppa designed minimum distance d G is equal to n m. If m &lt; n and m is a multiple of r or m n q, then the true minimum distance of C m is equal to d G , see Stichtenoth <ref> [19, Theorem 4] </ref>. Yang and Kumar [24] and Xing [23] proved that C m has minimum distance at most n m + t, in case m &lt; n and m = rs + t and 0 t r 1. <p> Furthermore the divisor r 3 P 1 is equivalent with D, see [20] or <ref> [19] </ref>. Thus if m n, then G m is an abundant divisor of abundance m n. Therefore C n+a is an [r 3 ; r 3 + a r (r 1)=2; r a] code for all 0 a &lt; r, by Theorem 2.11. <p> Example 5.4 The code C (D; mP 1 ) on the Hermitian curve over F q , where q = r 2 , has Goppa designed minimum distance m r 2 + r + 2. It follows from work of Tiersma [20], in case q is even, and Stichtenoth <ref> [19] </ref> for arbitrary q, that C (D; mP 1 ) is the dual of C m which is equal to C r 3 +r 2 r2m . Suppose m r (3r 1)=2 2. Let e = b (m r (3r 5)=2)=2c. Suppose r e 1 &gt; 2.

Reference-contexts: Yang and Kumar [24] and Xing [23] proved that C m has minimum distance at most n m + t, in case m &lt; n and m = rs + t and 0 t r 1. Furthermore the divisor r 3 P 1 is equivalent with D, see <ref> [20] </ref> or [19]. Thus if m n, then G m is an abundant divisor of abundance m n. Therefore C n+a is an [r 3 ; r 3 + a r (r 1)=2; r a] code for all 0 a &lt; r, by Theorem 2.11. <p> Hence A is effective. Example 5.4 The code C (D; mP 1 ) on the Hermitian curve over F q , where q = r 2 , has Goppa designed minimum distance m r 2 + r + 2. It follows from work of Tiersma <ref> [20] </ref>, in case q is even, and Stichtenoth [19] for arbitrary q, that C (D; mP 1 ) is the dual of C m which is equal to C r 3 +r 2 r2m .

Reference-contexts: Tsfasman, Vladut, Zink and Ihara showed that modular curves have many rational points with respect to the genus, if q is a square, that is to say N ( p q 1)g, see <ref> [21, 4.1.52] </ref>.

Later Pellikaan, Shen and van Wee [14] proved that every linear code can be represented with a curve, but if one imposes the condition m &lt; n, then long binary algebraic-geometric codes have information rate at most 1 2 . <p> We discuss upper bounds of the gonality in section 4, using upper bounds for the parameters of codes. We will give an application to the error correcting capacity of some codes in section 5. We use the book of Tsfasman and Vladut <ref> [21] </ref> as a reference, but our notation is different. <p> It follows from the work of Tsfasman, Vladut, Zink and Ihara, see <ref> [21] </ref>, that fl q = 1=( p q 1). <p> The A-bound is always below the GV-bound, and for 0 ffi &lt; q p q + 2, the A-bound is above the TVZ-bound. It is not difficult to show that the codes obtained by Katsman and Tsfasman <ref> [21, 3.4.23] </ref>, using subfield subcodes of algebraic-geometric codes, are always better than the A-bound. <p> Let X 2 m be the modular curve over F p , p a prime, as defined in <ref> [21, 4.1.50] </ref>. <p> has at least 2 m3 (p 1) rational points over F q , where q = p 2 , and genus 2 m3 + 1 ffi m , where ffi m is equal to 3:2 m=22 in case m is even, and 2 (m1)=2 in case m is odd, see <ref> [21, 4.1.59] </ref>. So the gonality of the curve is at least 2 m3 ( p q 1)=(q + 1), by Proposition 2.7. The divisor 2 m4 1 has dimension 2 and degree 2 m4 , see [21, 4.1.60]. <p> So the gonality of the curve is at least 2 m3 ( p q 1)=(q + 1), by Proposition 2.7. The divisor 2 m4 1 has dimension 2 and degree 2 m4 , see <ref> [21, 4.1.60] </ref>. So the go-nality of the curve is at most 2 m4 , which is asymptotically of the size g=2, see Remark 2.5. <p> (N; d) q N =V q (N; e); - 1 3 ffi 5 R R A - 1 1 1 8 ffi 2 5 R R A - 1 3 2 15 ffi 3 51 R R A - 1 2 3 24 ffi 4 52 R R A see <ref> [21, 1.1.41] </ref>. Hence V q (N; e) q Nk q g . Taking the q-logarithm gives the desired result. 2 Proposition 4.3 Let = (q 1)=q. Let n and N be positive integers such that n N . <p> If we use a sequence of modular curves, then we get a sequence of codes with information rate R p fl q , and relative minimum distance ffi 1 fl q , see <ref> [21] </ref>. In particular for q = 9 we get fl 9 = 1=2; R p ffi 1=2. But the Plokin bound gives the upper bound R 1 ffiq=(q 1) for such a sequence, so in the above case, we get R 7=16, which is a contradiction. <p> The second inequality follows from Proposition 2.7 and the existence of curves with N ( p q 1)g rational points whenever q is a square, see <ref> [21] </ref>. 2 Remark 4.8 The asymptotic Hamming bound gives H q (ffi=2) fl, if ffi and fl are the asymptotic relative distance and relative genus of a sequence of curves. <p> so this gives not an improvement of the bound q 1. 5 An application to decoding The dual of the functional code C L (D; G) is the residue code C (D; G), which is the image of the residue map from (G D) to F n q , see <ref> [21] </ref>, and is an [n,k,d] code such that k n m + g 1 and d m 2g + 2, if m &gt; 2g 2. If morover m &lt; n, then k = n m + g 1. <p> Let F be a divisor such that F has disjoint support with D and furthermore 1. dim (L (F )) &gt; e 3. d (C L (D; G)) + d (C (D; G)) &gt; n Then one can decode e errors with F , see [7], [16] and <ref> [21, 3.3] </ref>. There always exists such a divisor F if e = b (d G 1 g)=2c. <p> Remark 5.6 The function ff pol dec;lin q (ffi) of asymptotic good linear codes with a polynomial construction and polynomial contructable decoding algorithm, is bounded below by the Skorobogatov-Vladut-bound R SV (ffi) = 1 2fl q ffi, see <ref> [21, Theorem 3.4.34] </ref>. We have the following improvement. Proposition 5.7 ff pol dec;lin Proof This follows immediately from Proposition 5.2 and Remark 5.3, whenever ffi 2 q . For arbitrary ffi it is proved by Ehrhard [4], see also Remark 5.1. 2

Ehrhard [4] showed that one can decode b (d G 1 g + t)=2c errors with t + 1 divisors, given explicitly.

Reference-contexts: If m &lt; n and m is a multiple of r or m n q, then the true minimum distance of C m is equal to d G , see Stichtenoth [19, Theorem 4]. Yang and Kumar [24] and Xing <ref> [23] </ref> proved that C m has minimum distance at most n m + t, in case m &lt; n and m = rs + t and 0 t r 1. Furthermore the divisor r 3 P 1 is equivalent with D, see [20] or [19]. <p> We also get as a result that the codes C m have at least minimum distance r, for all n r m &lt; n, by Remark 2.13. Yang and Kumar [24] and Xing <ref> [23] </ref> proved that in fact equality holds. Definition 2.16 Let w = (w 1 ; : : : ; w l ) be an l-tuple of positive integers such that w 1 : : : w l .
