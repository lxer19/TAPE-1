Reference-contexts: One class of the manufacturing errors which have been exhaustively studied is that of stuck-at faults. Several techniques have been invented for generating test patterns to detect such type of errors as in <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] </ref>. The diagnosis is made by the use of data bases containing observation-diagnosis pairs. These data bases are normally created by fault simulation. In the case of design error diagnosis, only the correct behaviour is known, but not the correct circuit structure.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand equation solving is much more complex than the methods based on test patterns. Another solution, which is presented here, is to make use of ternary test patterns. These patterns were used in <ref> [6] </ref>, where the theoretical foundations of the formal verification using 3-value simulation were established. Under the application of these patterns the internal signal values are extracted easily, and can then be exploited for the diagnosis. <p> Second, they can be used also for the diagnosis and error localisation under certain error hypotheses. The main concept used is the concept of partial ordering of ternary vectors according to their information content. This concept has been presented in <ref> [6] </ref> and it states that for the ternary values f'0','1','X'g 0 X 0 &lt; 0 0 0 , 0 X 0 &lt; 0 1 0 . 0 0 0 and 0 1 0 are the normal Boolean values and 0 X 0 means 'shouldn't care'.

Reference-contexts: thus reduced to the generation of the weakest test patterns set that produce a fully defined value ( 0 0 0 or 0 1 0 ) at the circuit output. 2.1 Pattern generation based on AND/OR graphs This method is based on the representation of logic circuits by AND/OR graphs <ref> [7] </ref>. Every node in the graph is considered as a Boolean relation between some circuit signals, and the whole graph represents the set of relations imposed by the circuit structure and the gates functions. <p> If XOR and XNOR gates are used in the circuit, they are not subject to be erroneous. These assumptions will be a little bit relaxed, as will be discussed later. 4.1 Which error hypothesis to select first It was proved in <ref> [7] </ref> that, if the error hypothesis is HYP-1, then the EDP's will belong either to the ON-SET or the OFF-SET of the implementation, but not to both of them. Thus if the simulation results shows the existence of EDP's in the two sets, the hypothesis HYP-1 is excluded. <p> these results. 15 ON-SET OFF-SET Error Hypotheses p p HYP-0 then HYP-2 p - HYP-1 then HYP-2 then HYP-0 - HYP-1 then HYP-2 then HYP-0 Table 4.1: Order of considered error hypothesis 4.2 The diagnostic routines The diagnostic routines presented in this report are an extension of those presented in <ref> [7] </ref>. A theorem was presented there for determining the exact location of an inverter error in fanout-free circuits, however this theorem could unfortunately not be applied to non fanout-free circuits. Other techniques were also presented for the diagnosis of gate errors by exploiting the EDP's.

Reference-contexts: Thus if the simulation results shows the existence of EDP's in the two sets, the hypothesis HYP-1 is excluded. The problem is then to decide which hypothesis will be considered first. Based on the statistic study presented in <ref> [8] </ref> it was found that the inverter errors happen more frequently than the gate errors, and thus HYP-0 is considered before HYP-2.

Reference-contexts: The source of error is due to the use of a wrong component type, an extra component, a missing component, or a wrong connection. Very little has been published in the design error diagnosis domain. The first paper found in this subject is that of Berger <ref> [9] </ref>, where an algorithm was presented to find errors in fanout-free combinational networks. This restriction limits its application to very simple, non practical circuits. Odawara [10] used the incompatible test patterns to find 3 the error location.

This restriction limits its application to very simple, non practical circuits. Odawara <ref> [10] </ref> used the incompatible test patterns to find 3 the error location. These incompatible patterns produce different outputs when they are applied to the specification and the implementation. His method does not specify precisely the error location, but it specifies an area in which the error can be found.

Reference-contexts: The error is assumed to be somewhere in the cone of influence of this gate. Practically, this gate is almost found near the circuit output, and the proposed area includes a large part of the circuit. Another method was presented in <ref> [11] </ref>, for finding also the area in which the error can be found. The circuit functional description is divided into several sub functions, and the verification is made individually for sub-circuits corresponding to these sub functions.

Reference-contexts: The experimental results were shown only for inverter errors, but nothing was mentioned about its applicability to other error types, nor about the size of the suspected area. Madre <ref> [12] </ref> presented an automated system for the diagnosis and rectification of logic circuits. This system is based on the theorem prover PRIAM, and its equation solving capabilities.

Reference-contexts: The experimental results showed its application only to two circuits, namely, a 32-bit adder and an ALU. In the two cases, this method could not find a single error candidate (3 candidates in the first case, and 12 in the second). Another technique was presented in <ref> [13] </ref>. Starting from incompatible test patterns, other patterns called IPLDE (Input Patterns for Locating Design Errors) are generated. These patterns were used to reason about the incompatibility. The practical results showed that the number of error candidates presented by this method is large even for small circuits.

Reference-contexts: Starting from incompatible test patterns, other patterns called IPLDE (Input Patterns for Locating Design Errors) are generated. These patterns were used to reason about the incompatibility. The practical results showed that the number of error candidates presented by this method is large even for small circuits. Chung <ref> [14] </ref> specified the error zone as the intersection of all the cones of influence of the erroneous outputs. For each path in this cone, an error equation is found. These error equations are then used to find the error.
