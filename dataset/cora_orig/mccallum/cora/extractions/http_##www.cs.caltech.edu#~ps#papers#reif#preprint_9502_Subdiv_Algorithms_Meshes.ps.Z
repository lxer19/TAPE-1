Abstract: Some New Results on Subdivision Algorithms Abstract. We present a unified approach to subdivision algorithms for meshes of arbitrary topology admitting a rigorous analysis of the generated limit surfaces. A generalized sufficient criterion for generating tangent plane continuous surfaces is provided. In particular, it applies to complex eigenvalues and also shows that the so-called double dominant eigenvalue condition, which was supposed to be indispensable so far, is not substantial. In this paper we give a review of the approach provided in [6, 7] and generalize the results obtained there. It turns out that the so-called double dominant eigenvalue condition, which was supposed to be indispensable so far, is not substantial. Roughly speaking, this condition can be replaced by requiring the fourth eigenvalue to be smaller than the third one. In particular, this result applies to the case of a pair of complex conjugate dominant eigenvalues. The fact that all subdivision algorithms discussed so far reveal a double dominant eigenvalue is merely a consequence of the inherent symmetry of theses schemes and not a prerequisite for smoothness. Let X be a parametrically smooth spline surface consisting of quadrilateral patches x j ; j 2 J; with a single n-sided hole. For convenience, we shall assume that X is an infinite surface with the n-sided hole as its only boundary in order to avoid a formal discussion of the outer boundary of the surface. The parameter space := ! fi J consists of #J copies of the for Meshes of Arbitrary Topology
