Abstract: A new laser-based optical sensor system that provides hazard detection for planetary rovers is presented. The sensor can support safe travel at speeds up to 12cm/second for large (1m) rovers in full sunlight on Earth or Mars. This is at least a 5 times improvement over the sensor aboard NASA's Mars Pathfinder rover. The system overcomes limitations in the older design that require image differencing to detect a laser stripe in full sun. The new system ensures the projected laser light is detectable in a single image, eliminating the requirement for additional difference images. The improvement is significant since any reduction in image gathering or processing time provides for faster rover motion. The savings are even more important in the case of a Mars rover since power and radiation-hardening requirements lead to severely constrained computational resources. The paper includes a thorough discussion of design details and tradeoffs for optical hazard sensing that will benefit future efforts in this area.

Reference-contexts: The design could be extended in several ways. At present, a primary bottleneck in processing is image acquisition. Future incorporation of an Active Pixel Sensor (APS) will reduce this overhead significantly <ref> [9] </ref>. An additional row of beams aimed down at a steeper angle will provide close-in hazard detection and allow for the case when the system must look over a hill as the rover approaches the top. Also the system will be integrated with stereo vision in a hybrid system.
