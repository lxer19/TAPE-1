Reference-contexts: finally in section 4 some concluding remarks on the current status of the CEDER-project and further plans for the project are given. 2 The CEDER-Method The CEDER-Method is based on the philosophy that erroneous and inexpedient design decisions must be found as early as possible in the development process (cf. <ref> [Boehm88] </ref>). Hereby errors can be corrected earlier with a decrease in development costs as a consequence. To achieve this the CEDER-Method contains a notation for the description of the design suited for analysis. Hereby design errors can be found before the implementation of the system has been started.

Reference-contexts: The method has certain similarities to Jacksons System Development (JSD)[Jackson83], but the notation is based on ideas from the ISO standard LOTOS [ISO8807] and a draft BSI standard for META IV, the specification language of VDM <ref> [BSIVDM90] </ref>. In the CEDER-project the CEDER-Method is being refined for industrial use, and tools supporting a designer in the use of CEDER is being developed.

Reference-contexts: In this way the decisions made by the designer about the dependencies are taken stepwise and the syntax of expressions support this stepwise process of decisions. The notation used in this stage is described in detail in <ref> [Larsen90] </ref>. First the partial ordering of in-events are described. Such partial orderings describe the order in which the in-events are treated by the system. <p> Here it should be noticed that there is a formal difference between the semantics of the "|" operator used in event expressions and the "[]" operator used in expanded event sequences. For a (formal) definition of these operators consult <ref> [Larsen90] </ref>.
