Title: DMQL: A Data Mining Query Language for Relational Databases

Abstract: The emerging data mining tools and systems lead naturally to the demand of a powerful data mining query language, on top of which many interactive and flexible graphical user interfaces can be developed. This motivates us to design a data mining query language, DMQL, for mining different kinds of knowledge in relational databases. Portions of the proposed DMQL language have been implemented in our DBMiner system for interactive mining of multiple-level knowledge in relational databases.

Reference-contexts: Significance threshold. It indicates that there should exist at least some reasonably substantial evidence (support) of a pattern in the data set in order to warrant its presentation. In mining association rules, this threshold is called the minimum support <ref> [1] </ref>, and the patterns passing this support threshold are called large (or frequent) data items; whereas in mining characteristic rules, it is called noise threshold [7], and the patterns which cannot pass this threshold are treated as noise. 3 2. Rule confidence threshold. <p> Rule confidence threshold. It indicates that the probability of B under condition of A in rule A ! B, i.e., P robfBjAg, must pass this threshold to make sure that the implication relationship is reasonably strong <ref> [1] </ref>. 3. Rule redundancy threshold. It indicates that the rules to be presented are not similar to those already there [19]. <p> find association rules related to gpa, birth place, address from student where major = "cs" and birth place = "Canada" with support threshold = 0.05 with confidence threshold = 0.7 This query will first collect the relevant set of data and then execute an association mining algorithm, 4 such as <ref> [1] </ref> or [8], to find a set of interesting association rules. The support and confidence thresholds are specified (otherwise using default values) for mining strong rules. 2 4 Specification of concept hierarchies Concept hierarchy (or lattice) provides useful background knowledge for expressing data mining results in concise, high-level terms. <p> It is reasonably easy to design a data mining language for data mining in relational databases. It is a great challenge to design languages for knowledge mining in other kinds of databases, such as transaction databases <ref> [1] </ref>, object-oriented databases [10], spatial databases [13], multimedia databases, legacy databases, global information systems [22], etc. With the emerging activities for data mining in these databases, the design of data mining languages for such mining tasks may become an important issue in future research.

Reference-contexts: Besides mining characteristic, discriminant, classification, and association rules, DMQL needs to specify primitives for other data mining tasks, including data clustering [15, 4, 23], and mining data evolution rules or sequential patterns <ref> [2] </ref>, deviation rules [16], rules characterized by some specific patterns [18, 6], etc. It is necessary to work out such language primitives for effective communication with a data mining system.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, with the availability of concept hierarchies, knowledge can be expressed at different levels of abstractions. Interactive mining should facilitate the discovered knowledge to be viewed at different concept levels and from different angles. This can be accomplished by transforming data mining results conveniently with "roll-up" and "drill-down" operations <ref> [11] </ref>. Notice that roll-up can be done by climbing up the concept hierarchy of an attribute or dropping some attribute (s); whereas drill-down by stepping down the concept hierarchy of an attribute or adding some attributes.

Reference-contexts: Such tasks should be accomplished conveniently by a graphical user interface although they can be specified (but not so conveniently) using DMQL language primitives. For interactive refining of data mining results, one should display the results using rule visualization tools <ref> [12] </ref> or in different output forms, including generalized relations, projected statistical tables, bar charts, pie charts, curves, surfaces, quantitative rules, etc. This process may be helped by report writers or graphical display softwares.
