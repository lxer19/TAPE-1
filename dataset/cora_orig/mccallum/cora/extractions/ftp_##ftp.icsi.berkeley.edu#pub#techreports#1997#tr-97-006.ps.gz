Abstract: ion and Decomposition Abstract With the emergence of distributed computing and the increasing trend towards the reuse of geographic data, a new generation of geographic information systems (GIS) is currently being specified. The key characteristics of these open GIS are modularity and extensibility, and they are composed of existing software systems such as database management systems, traditional GIS, statistics packages and simulation models. They can be defined in terms of generic frameworks which facilitate both information exchange between participating systems and the addition of new functionalities. Even though the idea of defining open GISs is not new, it is crucial that the steps necessary to design such a complex system be clearly decomposed. In this paper, we propose a layer decomposition for the design of an open GIS. Each layer corresponds to a different level of abstraction, starting with the application or user level down to the invocation of systems services. In addition, each such level can be specified by the same set of concepts: data, operation and session (DOS model). The metadata needed for the interaction between levels is indispensable to achieve openness. We believe that the clear definition of such a framework will greatly facilitate open GIS design. in Open GIS

Reference-contexts: An important step towards open geographic information systems are distributed maps built according to the browser / server paradigm of the World-Wide Web, i.e. HTTP. The MapGuide System <ref> [Aut96] </ref> is a recent product which even supports overlay of maps from different databases or zooming into attribute data. The lightweight client approach requires to perform all operations on the server site. Only operations on maps are supported. The application protocol between clients and server is proprietary.

Reference-contexts: There is still no difference between systems, hence the repository where data may come from is not relevant. (Geographic) data is represented according to a virtual data model not detailed here. Extensions to geographic types of <ref> [BNPS94] </ref> or [PAGM96] and of course of data warehouses [Wid95] (see below) are well-suited for this purpose. The data model at this level must be general enough to take many representations into account. It is fundamental that each object manipulated by the enduser be unique.

Reference-contexts: The idea is to use standards or well-known mechanisms to implement each level. For instance, some features of an intermediate level can be implemented using a database system, while at lower levels they could be implemented with, e.g., CORBA <ref> [Cor92] </ref> and system calls. A second interesting point is that each level of abstraction is described by the same set of concepts: data and operations considered at this level, and sessions, which expresses how operations relate to each other. We shall refer to this 3-component concept as the DOS model.

Reference-contexts: However, in GIS, consistency problems arise less frequently than in transactional systems where updates happen very often. Complementary in a way to the DWH because it deals with distributed software (methods) is the MMM project <ref> [GMS + 96] </ref>, which allows the remote access of software modules on the WWW. Our proposal, which is an extension of [VS94], is concerned with conceptual design issues.
