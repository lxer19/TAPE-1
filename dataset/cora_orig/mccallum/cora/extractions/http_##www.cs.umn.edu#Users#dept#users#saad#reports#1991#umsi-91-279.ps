Abstract: We present a variant of the GMRES algorithm which allows changes in the preconditioning at every step. There are many possible applications of the new algorithm some of which are briefly discussed. In particular, a result of the flexibility of the new variant is that any iterative method can be used as a preconditioner. For example, the standard GMRES algorithm itself can be used as a preconditioner, as can CGNR (or CGNE) the conjugate gradient method applied to the normal equations. However, the more appealing utilization of the method is in conjunction with relaxation techniques, possibly multi-level techniques. The possibility of changing preconditioners may be exploited to develop efficient iterative methods and to enhance robustness. A few numerical experiments are reported to illustrate this fact.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. Krylov subspace techniques have increasingly been viewed as general purpose iterative methods, especially since the popularization of preconditioning techniques <ref> [2] </ref> in the mid 70's. Although iterative methods lack the robustness of direct methods, they are effective for the large class of problems arising from partial differential equations of the elliptic type.

Reference-contexts: We have compared the following methods. 1. A standard ILU (0) preconditioned GMRES (m) iteration with m = 20 direc tion vectors. 2. The CGNR iteration (Conjugate Gradient Normal equations) using an ILQ preconditioner with level-of-fill equal to 5; see <ref> [3] </ref> for details on these pre-conditioners. The idea of ILQ is to perform an incomplete Gram-Schmidt factorization on the rows of A. The normal equations are preconditioned using this factorization and the Conjugate Gradient method (CGNR version) is used to solve these equations. 3.

Reference-contexts: In this situation, the single step SSOR preconditioner and the ILU preconditioning may perform very poorly. However, our experience is that if a higher level-of-fill ILU or a multiple step SSOR (or SOR) pre-conditioner is used then the preconditioned method can perform rather well <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> A few other advantages are discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>. Thus, we wish to be able to apply an arbitrary number of SOR or SSOR steps in the preconditioning phase, for example, in order to solve the preconditioning system M y = v to a given tolerance. <p> This is not too desirable for a CG-type solver. However, we found that when using multiple steps, SOR is often more economical than SSOR as a preconditioner. We will not discuss these applications here but refer the reader to the paper <ref> [4] </ref>. Rather, we would like to demonstrate the flexibility of FGMRES by simply combining it with other iterative methods to improve its robustness. We are particularly interested in combinations with CGNR, and with the standard GMRES itself.

Reference-contexts: If not one can attempt another possible iterative method/preconditioner and switch periodically if necessary. It is desirable to be able to switch within the outer iteration instead of restarting. For the GMRES algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>, this can be accomplished with the help of a rather simple modification of the standard algorithm, referred to as the Flexible GMRES (FGMRES) which is presented in this paper. <p> An important property of FGMRES is that it satisfies the residual norm minimization property over the preconditioned Krylov subspace just as in the standard GMRES algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. For motivation, we mention that there are cases in which relaxation type precon-ditioners are more attractive than the usual ILU preconditioners. These include the case in which a red-black ordering is used. In this situation, the single step SSOR preconditioner and the ILU preconditioning may perform very poorly. <p> Instead, it is easy to show that the following equality takes place AZ m = V m+1 H m :(1) This replaces the simpler relation (AM 1 )V m = V m+1 H m which holds for the standard preconditioned GMRES <ref> [5] </ref>. Following [5] we will denote by H m the m fi m matrix obtained from H m by deleting its last row and by ^v j+1 the vector w obtained at the end of step 2-b of the algorithm, i.e.,, the vector obtained before normalizing w to get v j+1 <p> Instead, it is easy to show that the following equality takes place AZ m = V m+1 H m :(1) This replaces the simpler relation (AM 1 )V m = V m+1 H m which holds for the standard preconditioned GMRES <ref> [5] </ref>.

This is because the subspace of approximants is no longer a standard Krylov subspace and we have no isomorphism with the space of polynomials. However, the optimalty property of Proposition 2.1 can be exploited in some specific situations.

For an example of (3) see the recent work by Tezduyar and co-authors <ref> [6] </ref> in which two types of preconditioners are alternatively applied at each FGMRES step to mix the effects of "local" and "global" interactions. Tezduyar et al. reported good performance with this procedure, much better than using either of the two preconditioners by itself.
