Reference-contexts: Theorem 4 implies that the length of S is at most O (n). Consequently, jEj 4k 3 O (n) = O (n): 2 It remains to prove Lemmas 5 and 6. 2.3 Proof of Lemma 5 We apply a simple greedy algorithm <ref> [1] </ref> which, for given integer l 1 and finite sequence A, returns an l-regular subsequence B (A; l) of A. In the first step, an auxilliary sequence B is taken empty.

Reference-contexts: Pach, Sharokhi, and Szegedy [10] proved that any geometric graph on n vertices with no k pairwise crossing edges contains at most O (n log 2k4 n) edges (k 3). This bound was improved to O (n log 2k6 n) in <ref> [2] </ref> (k 3) (thus, in particular, to O (n) for k = 3). For k 4 we further improve this bound to O (n log n). Theorem 3 Let k 3 be a constant.

Reference-contexts: It is well-known <ref> [3] </ref> (and not difficult to prove) that any 2-regular sequence over an n-element alphabet containing no alternating subsequence of length 4 has length at most 2n 1. In the proof of Theorem 1 we apply the following related result. <p> Proof. The part of P S (G) corresponding to I (v i )"D (G) is a Davenport-Schinzel sequence of order 2 on m i integers (i.e., it contains no alternating subsequence of length 4). As we have already mentioned in Section 2.1, it is well-known <ref> [3] </ref> that the length of such a sequence is at most 2m i 1. 2 Thus, the length of D (G) (and also of P S (G)) is at most 2n (] of maximal intervals I (v i )) 2n 3; a contradiction.

Reference-contexts: Lemma 5 easily follows from Claim 7 (with j = m) and from the pigeon-hole principle. 2 2.4 Proof of Lemma 6 In the proof of Lemma 6 we apply the folowing easy consequence of Dilworth's theorem <ref> [4] </ref>. Theorem 8 If the union of three partial orderings on a set I of size at least (k 1) 3 + 1 is a linear ordering on I, then at least one of the partial orderings contains a chain of length k. - 5 - Proof.

Reference-contexts: These bounds follow from the upper bound d k n (1=d k exponential in k) in Theorem 4, which can be obtained from the proof of Theorem 4 in <ref> [6] </ref>. However, it is possible that the bound in Theorem 4 can be improved to e k n, where 1=e k is polynomial in k. <p> It is well-known [3] (and not difficult to prove) that any 2-regular sequence over an n-element alphabet containing no alternating subsequence of length 4 has length at most 2n 1.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A geometric graph is a graph G = (V; E) drawn in the plane so that the vertex set V consists of points in general position and the edge set E consists of straight line segments between points of V . See <ref> [9] </ref> for a survey of results about geometric graphs. Two edges of a geometric graph are said to be parallel , if they are opposite sides of a convex quadrilateral. Two edges cross, if their relative interiors intersect.

Reference-contexts: A related question is how many edges can be contained in a geometric graph with no k pairwise crossing edges. For k = 2, Euler's formula gives the upper bound 3n 6 (n 3). Pach, Sharokhi, and Szegedy <ref> [10] </ref> proved that any geometric graph on n vertices with no k pairwise crossing edges contains at most O (n log 2k4 n) edges (k 3). This bound was improved to O (n log 2k6 n) in [2] (k 3) (thus, in particular, to O (n) for k = 3).
