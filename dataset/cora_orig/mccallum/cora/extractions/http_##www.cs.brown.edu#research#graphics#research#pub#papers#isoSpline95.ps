Abstract: We present a method for approximating an isosurface with a smooth parametric representation. From the isosurface we first produce a patch mesh, a description of how many surface patches there are and how they are connected. We then create a smooth surface from the patch mesh.

Reference-contexts: Sculpting with a 3D paint brush produces very free-form objects but the surfaces are "warbly", in part due to the difficulty of controlling and reading a 3D input device. Very little work exists on converting any but algebraic implicit surfaces to a parametric representation. If the surface is tessellated <ref> [Blo88] </ref> [LC87] then the problem can be viewed as one of fitting a smooth surface to a set of data points. In [HDD + 94] a technique is presented that produces a C 1 surface from unorganized points, but this surface does not have a parametric representation.

Parametric surfaces (e.g., B-splines) provide good detail control, but creating topologically arbitrary surfaces with them is difficult. <p> Parametric surfaces (e.g., B-splines) provide good detail control, but creating topologically arbitrary surfaces with them is difficult. We propose a modeling paradigm wherein an artist creates a sketch of an object using a 3D paint program such as Sculpt <ref> [GH91] </ref> from which a smooth parametric representation of an isosurface is constructed, at some level of fidelity. Further adjustment of the surface detail is accomplished using the parametric representation. In order to produce a parametric model from an isosurface we must first determine a patch mesh. <p> The latter are usually constructed from real world data (e.g., medical resonance imaging scans) but in <ref> [GH91] </ref> the data set is created using a 3D version of a paint brush. Blobby models produce very smooth surfaces but their geometry is somewhat limited by the shapes of the underlying skeletons.

Reference-contexts: Very little work exists on converting any but algebraic implicit surfaces to a parametric representation. If the surface is tessellated [Blo88] [LC87] then the problem can be viewed as one of fitting a smooth surface to a set of data points. In <ref> [HDD + 94] </ref> a technique is presented that produces a C 1 surface from unorganized points, but this surface does not have a parametric representation. A different approach is to use the tessellation as a patch mesh, with one patch for each polygon in the tessellation.

Reference-contexts: If we examine one of these planes and all of the edges lying in that plane, we see that the edges form closed loops, i.e. chains <ref> [Lef49] </ref>. We call these loops isothetic chains because the loop lies in a single plane.

Reference-contexts: If we associate with each face in the patch mesh a total absolute Gaussian curvature <ref> [MP77] </ref>, we can require that the aggregate absolute Gaussian curvature of any patch not exceed a certain threshold. This prevents the removal of chains which pass through areas of high curvature. 10 Remarks The algorithm presented here produces a parametric surface which is an approximation of the isosurface.
