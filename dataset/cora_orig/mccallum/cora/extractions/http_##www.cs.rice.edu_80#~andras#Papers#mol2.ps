Title: The generative power of feature geometry  
Author: Andras Kornai 
Affiliation: CSLI, Stanford University  
Abstract: The paper presents a formalization of the common structure underlying different proposals concerning the geometry of phonological features. Using the concepts and tools of elementary set theory, lattice theory, and the theory of independent boolean algebras, a metatheory of autoseg-mental feature structure is developed. This metatheory enables us to compare contemporary autosegmental phonology to the now abandoned "standard" phonology and to the historically important Pan . ini-type phonology as well, and to investigate the restrictions on the use of features in phonological theory.
