Abstract: We present an overview of a best-effort transport protocol that supports conferencing with digital audio and video across interconnected packet switched networks. The protocol delivers the highest quality conference service possible given the current load in the network. Quality is defined in terms of synchronization between audio and video, the number of frames played out of order, and the end-to-end latency in the conference. High quality conference are realized through four transport and display mechanisms and a real-time implementation of these mechanisms that integrates operating system services ( e.g., scheduling and resource allocation, and device management) with network communication services (e.g., transport protocols). In concert these mechanisms dynamically adapt the conference frame rate to the bandwidth available in the network, minimize the latency in the displayed streams while avoiding discontinuities, and provide quasi-reliable delivery of audio frames.

Reference-contexts: Our work demonstrates empirically that it is possible to establish and maintain high-fidelity conferences across congested packetswitched networks without requiring special services from the network such as admission control, jitter control [3], resource reservation <ref> [1] </ref>, or isochronous transmission. While such services are clearly useful and important, they equally clearly come at an additional cost; be it the installation of new wiring or other network hardware, the modification of routing software at all network interconnection points, or a reduction in the total bandwidth available conferences.

Reference-contexts: Factors such as the lengths of the hardware audio and video pipelines, the latency in the operating system and network influence latency in our environment. Our protocol endeavors to ensure an end-to-end (acquisition to display) latency of no more 250 ms <ref> [2] </ref>. Our approach to latency management is described in [7]. Jitter control is required to minimize the number of discontinuities in the displayed audio and video streams. The actual requirements for allowable discontinuities differ dramatically between audio and video.

Reference-contexts: Through the use of a real-time operating system that provides computation and communication services specifically tailored to the needs of applications that process continuous-time media streams such as digital audio and video <ref> [4] </ref>, we can closely control the processing of audio/video frames on a transmitting workstation to ensure that frames progress from acquisition and compression hardware to the network interface with minimal jitter.

Reference-contexts: For audio and video acquisition and display we use IBM-Intel ActionMedia 750 hardware and IBM PS/2 workstations. The PS/2s run a real-time operating system we have developed (YARTOS <ref> [5] </ref>) and support UDP/IP. The network configuration used for experiments consists of two 16 megabit token rings interconnected by a series of 10 megabit ethernets.

Reference-contexts: The frame times are used by the transport layer to compute deadlines for transmitting packets, and to intelligently combine audio and video data into network packets. Packets are scheduled at the network interface using a deadline-based scheduling algorithm <ref> [6] </ref>. 5 The application controlling the audio and video generation processes invoke an asynchronous transmit operation whenever an audio or video frame has been generated. Outgoing frames are queued in the transport system. The protocol manages separate queues for audio and video frames.
