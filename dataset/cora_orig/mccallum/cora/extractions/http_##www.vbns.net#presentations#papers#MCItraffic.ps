Abstract: An abridged version of this paper appears in IEEE Network, November/December 1997. Abstract The Internet is rapidly growing in number of users, traffic levels, and topological complexity. At the same time it is increasingly driven by economic competition. These developments render the chara cterization of network usage and workloads more diff icult, and yet more critical. Few recent studies have been published reporting Internet backbone traffic usage and characteristics. At MCI, we have impl emented a high-performance, low-cost monitoring sy stem that can capture traffic and perform analyses. We have deployed this monitoring tool on OC-3 trunks within internetMCIs backbone and also within the NSF-sponsored vBNS. This paper presents observations on the patterns and characteristics of wide-area Internet traffic, as recorded by MCIs OC-3 traffic monitors. We report on measurements from two OC-3 trunks in MCIs commercial Internet backbone over two time ranges (24-hour and 7-day) in the presence of up to 240,000 flows. We reveal the characteristics of the traffic in terms of packet sizes, flow duration, vo lume, and percentage composition by protocol and a pplication, as well as patterns seen over the two time scales.

Reference-contexts: In its role as the network service provider for the National Science Foundations (NSF's) very-high-speed Bac kbone Network Service (vBNS) project, MCI has developed an OC3-based traffic monitor, known as OC3MON <ref> [ACTW97] </ref>. This publicly-available tool facilitates measurement and analysis of highspeed OC3 trunks that carry hundreds of thousands of simultaneous flows. In this paper, we report on traffic measurements taken from two locations on internetMCIs commercial bac kbone.

Reference-contexts: We characterize the traffic in terms of the IP protocols and applications present, the packet sizes seen, and the properties of the various flows observed. Our measurements confirm the continuation of the trend observed by earlier studies <ref> [BC94] </ref> whereby the Web has grown to be the largest single application on the Internet. 3 Description of the OC3 Monitor In this se ction, we briefly describe OC3MON, our special-purpose OC3-rate monitoring and analysis platform, developed in a collaboration between MCIs vBNS Engineering and NLANR.

Reference-contexts: A number of comprehensive studies have been published over the years as the Internet has evolved from the original ARPANET [Kleinrock76] to todays multi-provider commercial environment. Under its centralized administration, the NSFNET, from 1988-1995, provided a single Internet backbone with accessible measurement points. Traffic studies from this era include <ref> [CPB93] </ref>, which investigated detailed NNstat and SNMP NSFNET data in May 1992 and earlier, presenting a range of traffic characteristics on what was at the time a T1 backbone. Application usage was reported as being dominated by FTP, SMTP, NNTP, DNS, Telnet, and a growing amount of other traffic.

Reference-contexts: Any flow for which the monitor has not seen a packet within the last 64 seconds is consi dered to be an expired flow. This flow definition was proposed in <ref> [Claffy96] </ref>. A flow for which a packet was seen within the last second is co nsidered to be an active flow. The monitor reports statistics based on expired flows whenever polled by a collector.

Reference-contexts: We note that a more efficient encapsulation, such as VC Based Multiplexing <ref> [Heinanen93] </ref>, that allows 40-byte packets to be carried by a single ATM cell would significantly improve IP-over-ATM efficiency. VC Based Multiplexing would improve ATMs bitefficiency to 84.47% for the packet size data presented here.

Reference-contexts: In the case of ATM, we assume LLC/SNAP encapsulation and the use of AAL5 framing, which are in prevalent use on the Internet today. The results, shown in Table 1, are similar to those r eported by Tony Li for FIX-West packet traces <ref> [Li97] </ref>. We see that, as expected, SONET (at 94% bitefficiency) is more efficient than ATM (at 80%).

Some schemes, including Tag Switching, base the optimization of flows on IP routing information or some administrative procedure. <p> It is important to note that the above results are dependent on how a flow is defined. Previous studies have defined a flow based solely on IP source and de stination addresses and a timeout value <ref> [NLM96] </ref>, in contrast to our more restrictive definition of a flow, which includes protocol and port numbers. Fu rther aggregation of traffic into flows could be examined by defining a flow based on source and destination network, CIDR block, or Autonomous System (AS) number.

Reference-contexts: Many TCP implementations that do not impl ement Path MTU Discovery use either 512 or 536 bytes as the default Maximum Segment Size (MSS) for nonlocal IP destinations, yielding a 552-byte or 576-byte packet size <ref> [Stevens94] </ref>. A Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) size of 1500 bytes is characteristic of Ethernet-attached hosts. shows that almost 75% of the packets are smaller than the typical TCP MSS of 552 bytes. Nearly half of the packets are 40 to 44 bytes in length.
