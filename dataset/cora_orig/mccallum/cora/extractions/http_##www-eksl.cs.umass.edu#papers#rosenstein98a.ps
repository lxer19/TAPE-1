Abstract: This paper describes a way of extracting concepts from streams of sensor readings. In particular, we demonstrate the value of attractor reconstruction techniques for transforming time series into clusters of points. These clusters, in turn, represent perceptual categories with predictive value to the agent/environment system. We also discuss the relationship between categories and concepts, with particular emphasis on class membership and predictive inference.

Reference-contexts: Introduction This research is part of an effort to explain how senso-rimotor agents develop symbolic, conceptual thought, as every human child does. As in <ref> (Cohen et al. 1996) </ref> we are trying to "grow" an intelligent agent from minimal beginnings by having it interact with a complex environment. One problem with such projects is the transformation of streams of sensor data into symbolic concepts, cf. the symbol grounding problem (Harnad 1990).

Reference-contexts: But before any agent can make use of concepts, it must first discover the pertinent categories. One general technique for discovering categories is to form clusters of points in a suitable space. This was the basis of Elman's work on learning lexical classes from word co-occurrence statistics <ref> (Elman 1990) </ref>. El-man first trained a recurrent neural network to predict successive words in a long input string. This then set the stage for hierarchical clustering of the hidden-unit activation space, where the result was groups of words that coincide with classes like noun-food or verb-percept.

Hence, the focus of this paper is an unsupervised learning mechanism for extracting concepts from time series of sensor readings. Concepts are abstractions of experience that confer a predictive ability for new situations.

Reference-contexts: Concepts and Clusters As shown earlier in Figure 1, there is a close relationship between concepts and categories. Indeed, "there is nothing more basic than categorization to our thought, perception, action, and speech" <ref> (Lakoff 1984) </ref>. But before any agent can make use of concepts, it must first discover the pertinent categories. One general technique for discovering categories is to form clusters of points in a suitable space. <p> The point of this example is that a solution was found through interaction with the world.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, Omlin and Giles described a way to identify clusters in a network's hidden-unit space, with each cluster representing a node in an associated finite-state machine <ref> (Omlin & Giles 1996) </ref>. Our approach to clustering works directly from delay coordinates and proceeds with no prior training. For the pursuit/avoidance simulator, we begin with the first observed interaction and immediately create a cluster consisting of this lone experience.

A similar definition follows from the influential work of Rosch involving categories and their abstractions, called prototypes <ref> (Rosch & Lloyd 1978) </ref>. <p> Each prototype is simply the average object-distance time series formed from all interactions that make up a given cluster. (Strictly speaking, a prototype consists of m delay coordinates, although we show the entire time series to illustrate distinctive patterns.) This implementation is entirely consistent with Rosch's work on prototypes <ref> (Rosch & Lloyd 1978) </ref>, and also serves two practical purposes: as a way for testing cluster similarity, and as a way for understanding the meaning of a cluster. 50, with similarity threshold s = 0:2, embedding dimension m = 5, and embedding delay J = 1.

Reference-contexts: Activity Maps Our previous approach to concept discovery was based on representations of dynamics called activity maps <ref> (Rosenstein et al. 1997) </ref>. In keeping with the functional view of concepts in Figure 1, we also made the distinction between two types of activity maps: behavior maps for recognizing agent behaviors such as crash or kiss, and interaction maps for predicting outcomes such as contact or no-contact. <p> With the pursuit/avoidance simulator, this library of activity maps proved sufficient for recognizing the participants of a new trial and for predicting a contact or no-contact outcome. Table 1 illustrates the performance of the recognition algorithm in <ref> (Rosenstein et al. 1997) </ref>. Interestingly, this confusion table demonstrates the misinterpretation of the various behaviors. For example, 66% of the time the algorithm confused kiss with one of the crash movement strategies, yet rarely mistook kiss for one of the avoid types.

Reference-contexts: In this work we make use of an attractor reconstruction technique called the method of delays or delay-space embedding. Takens proved that the method of delays provides a means for mapping a time series to a topologically equivalent spatial representation (an embedding) of an underlying dynamical system <ref> (Takens 1981) </ref>. This mapping is accomplished by forming an m-dimensional vector of delay coordinates, X T where fx 1 ; x 2 ; :::; x n g is the n-point time series, m is called the embedding dimension, and J is the embedding delay.
