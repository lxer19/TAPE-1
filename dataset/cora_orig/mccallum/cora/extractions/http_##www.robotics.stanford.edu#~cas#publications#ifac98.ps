Abstract: Cooperative mobile manipulation capabilities are key to new applications of robotics in space, underwater, construction, and the service environments. This article discusses the ongoing effort at Stanford University for the development of mobile manipulation capabilities to aid humans in a variety of material handling tasks. The work presented in this paper focuses on the extension of the Augmented Object and the Virtual Linkage models for fixed base manipulation, to mobile cooperative manipulation systems. We propose a new decentralized control structure for cooperative tasks which is suitable to the more autonomous nature of mobile systems and prove its efficacy in simulation.

Reference-contexts: The implementation of this decentralized control structure has been successfully proven in simulation and results are presented here. In order to provide an experimental testbed for the integration of the above mobile manipulation strategies, we have designed and built two holonomic mobile manipulator platforms <ref> (Khatib et al., 1997) </ref> (Pin and S.M., 1994), SAMM (Stanford Assistant Mobile Manipulator), shown in Figure 1. The aim of the SAMM project is to develop a mobile "robotic assistant" to aid humans in a variety of operations involving transportation and manipulation of materials. 2. <p> In such a decentralized control scheme, each robot makes decisions and closes its own control loop based on its local sensory information and that received from other platforms. In the proposed decentralized control structure <ref> (Khatib et al., 1997) </ref>, the object level specifications of the task are transformed into individual tasks for each of the cooperative robots. Local feedback control loops are then developed at each grasp point.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION A central issue in mobile manipulation is cooperative operations between multiple vehicle/arm systems (Uchiyama and Dauchez, 1988)(Adams et al., 1995). Such systems are usually characterized by a large degree of actuator force redundancy. Our approach to controlling such systems is based on two models: The augmented object <ref> (Khatib, 1987b) </ref>(Khatib, 1987a) and virtual linkage (Williams and Khatib, 1993). The augmented object describes the system's closed-chain dynamics and allows for motion control specification of the entire system at the object level.

Reference-contexts: Such systems are usually characterized by a large degree of actuator force redundancy. Our approach to controlling such systems is based on two models: The augmented object (Khatib, 1987b)(Khatib, 1987a) and virtual linkage <ref> (Williams and Khatib, 1993) </ref>. The augmented object describes the system's closed-chain dynamics and allows for motion control specification of the entire system at the object level. The virtual linkage model makes use of the system's actuator force redundancy to allow for the characterization and control of object internal forces. <p> F also has the same additive property shown above for fl (x), (x; _ x) and p (x). Object manipulation requires accurate control of internal forces. We have proposed the virtual linkage <ref> (Williams and Khatib, 1993) </ref>, as a model of object internal forces associated with multi-grasp manipulation. <p> Local feedback control loops are then developed at each grasp point. The task transformation and the design of the local controllers are accomplished in consistency with the augmented object and virtual linkage models, (Khatib, 1987a) and <ref> (Williams and Khatib, 1993) </ref>. The overall structure is shown in point is f i = f motion;i + f force;i : (14) The control vectors, f motion;i , are designed so that the combined motion of the various grasp points results in the desired motion at the object operational point. <p> The kinematic structure of the virtual linkage consists of a linear actuated joint joining the two grasp points to model internal tension stresses, and actuated spherical joints at each grasp point to resist internal moments, as described in <ref> (Williams and Khatib, 1993) </ref>. track a cubic spline for both motion and internal forces for each manipulator (both internal moments are controlled to remain at zero). The broken lines show the desired trajectory and the solid lines the actual response.
