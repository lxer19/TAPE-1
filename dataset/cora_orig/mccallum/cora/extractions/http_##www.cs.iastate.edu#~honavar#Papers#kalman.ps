Title: Is the Hippocampus a Kalman Filter?

Abstract: Growing evidence suggests that the hippocampal formation functions as a relational (or episodic) memory, and on tasks of a spatial nature, it serves as a place learning and recognition system. In this paper we develop a computational characterization of the hippocampal formation pertaining to spatial learning and localization, and show that the information processing posited for this structure closely matches an engineering tool for probabilistic spatial localization of robots: the Kalman filter. Based on this parallel, we derive expressions for information integration, propagation of covariances, and near-optimal update rules for the localization performed by our computational model.

The HF itself consists of the dentate gyrus (Dg), and regions CA3 and CA1 of Ammon's horn, as shown in Figure 1. formation. <p> Sb also receives input from the EC and projects to the pre- and para-subiculum, the deep layers of the EC, and to the hypothalamus, septum, anterior thalamus and cingulate cortex. Back-projections also exist from the EC to the cortical areas and the septum <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. At the cellular level, the HF of the rat contains spatially responsive cells, primarily place cells that fire maximally when the rat is in a particular portion of its environment. <p> For instance, Buzsaki has suggested that CA3 cells in the rat hippocampus temporarily store information during exploratory behavior (by means of their recurrent collaterals), and during consolidation, i.e. when the rat rests, they discharge in temporally-correlated bursts thereby potentiating the CA1 cells <ref> [2] </ref>. It is interesting to note that the consolidation phase offers possibilities for the propagation (if not the computation) of state updates and covariances. 11

Reference-contexts: Hip-pocampal lesions have also been found to produce severe deficits in the ability of rodents to traverse complex mazes (cf. appendix of <ref> [3] </ref>). This lesion data, along with neuro-anatomical and cellular studies, has led to the hypothesis that the hippocampal formation (HF) functions as a relational or episodic memory by forming associations between spatio-temporally contiguous events or sensory inputs. <p> At the cellular level, the HF of the rat contains spatially responsive cells, primarily place cells that fire maximally when the rat is in a particular portion of its environment. Since their discovery in 1971 <ref> [3] </ref>, several key properties of place cells and their firing fields have been identified through systematic experiments. For instance, it is now known that place fields are learned quickly when the animal is introduced into a new environment.

Reference-contexts: The CA1 layer too, contains place cells. However, since place cells continue to fire in the dark and are silent when the motor system is restrained, there appears to be motor system involvement in place cell firing. Further, since animals (particularly rodents) commonly use dead-reckoning for goal-directed spatial navigation <ref> [13] </ref>, it appears that place cell firing is linked to the animal's dead-reckoning mechanism. Based on this intuition we suggest that the CA1 cells associate the place code produced in the CA3 layer with the current position estimate of the animal derived from its path-integration system.

This has led to many probabilistic localization approaches for mobile robots.

One such localization tool is the Kalman filter (KF) [14], which maintains a stochastic spatial map, propagates sensory and motion uncertainties, and under certain conditions, provides optimal update rules for combining uncertain information <ref> [15] </ref>. The KF technique for robot localization maintains a stochastic map of the robot's environment at each discrete time-step k (called the state vector x k ), which includes an estimate of the robot's current position and possibly the estimated positions of other landmarks in the robot's environment. <p> Fortunately, we can extend our model to elegantly make such distinctions based on the Mahalanobis distance <ref> [15] </ref>. Mahalanobis distance computes the difference between predicted and observed values and normalizes them by their covari-ance. This distance measure has a 2 distribution with q degrees of freedom where q is the rank of the covariance matrix.
