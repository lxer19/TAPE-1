Abstract: Engineering problem solving requires both domain knowledge and an understanding of how to apply that knowledge. While much of the recent work in qualitative physics has focused on building reusable domain theories, there has been little attention paid to representing the control knowledge necessary for applying these models. This paper shows how qualitative representations and compositional modeling can be used to create control knowledge for solving engineering problems. This control knowledge includes modeling assumptions, plans and preferences. We describe an implemented system, called TPS (Thermodynamics Problem Solver) that illustrates the utility of these ideas in the domain of engineering thermodynamics. TPS to date has solved over 30 problems, and its solutions are similar to those of experts. We argue that our control vocabulary can be extended to most engineering problem solving domains, and employed in a wide variety of problem solving architectures.

SCHISM constructs a control volume by following a piece-of-stuff around the cycle. TPS uses initial state, the process and the final state of the substance to form control volumes. A separate control volume is created for each device examined.

Reference-contexts: Control knowledge can be encoded by a domain expert as a part of domain knowledge or the control knowledge can be learned through solving problems by identifying paths that lead to failure or success. Chunking (Laird, Rosenbloom and Newell, 1986), EBL <ref> (Dejong, 1986) </ref> and generating abstract plans (Knoblock, 1994) are strategies for automatically generating control knowledge through solving problems. Since these systems do not re-represent their domain knowledge, fundamental concepts of the domain that are not initially identified cannot be learned.

Reference-contexts: The plan given in Figure 6 directs the problem solver to fix the phase of the substance, which is needed in order to figure out which equations may be appropriate. 6. The Architecture of TPS TPS uses the suggestion architecture <ref> (Forbus & de Kleer, 1993) </ref> to solve problems. A problem is provided in the form of some initial assertions and a goal. 8 A central controller selects what goal to work on next.

Reference-contexts: Other research has created formalizations of engineering thermodynamics that are much broader, but still lack the control knowledge needed for capturing the efficiency and flexibility of human experts. For instance, CyclePad <ref> (Forbus & Whalley, 1994) </ref> contains enough qualitative and quantitative domain knowledge to carry out numerical steady-state analyses of continuous-flow systems. However, it also is excessive in its computations, sometimes solving hundreds of equations that it doesnt need to. <p> We have used compositional modeling (Falkenhainer & Forbus, 1991) for representing the thermodynamics knowledge in TPS. Our thermodynamics domain model is based on the model used in CyclePad <ref> (Forbus & Whalley, 1994) </ref>. It is organized around processes and pure substances which are transformed by processes. A process is an instantiation of a physical process, such as heating or cooling, or a combination of basic processes, where energy is transformed form one form to another. <p> An expert solution uses the minimal number of equations with no backtracking. The solution in twice) and two table-lookups to solve the problem. We compare these results to CyclePad and TPS results. CyclePad <ref> (Forbus & Whalley, 1994) </ref> solves thermodynamics problems using unconstrained forward chaining. TPS domain knowledge is based on CyclePads domain knowledge which has been provided by Forbus and Whalley. Although CyclePad can solve problems very fast, it solves a lot more equations then needed.

Reference-contexts: To completely cover such problems two additional extensions are needed. TPS currently cannot read or produce graphs when solving problems. We are planning on integrating TPS with SKETCHY <ref> (Pisan, 1995) </ref> to enable TPS to solve problems that require interpreting graphs and diagrams. Another avenue of research is incorporating qualitative simulation as one of TPS plans. Qualitative simulation can be used to 13 explore possible scenarios for problems where device behavior is ambiguous.

While SCHISM pioneered some useful ideas (e.g., heuristics for choosing good control volumes), both its domain knowledge and control knowledge were too limited to solve more than a handful of examples.
