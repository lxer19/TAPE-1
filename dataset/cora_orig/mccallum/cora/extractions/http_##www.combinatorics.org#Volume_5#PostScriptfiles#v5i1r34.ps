Abstract: Let V and W be n-dimensional vector spaces over GF (2). A mapping Q : V ! W is called crooked if it satisfies the following three properties: Q(0) = 0; Q(x) + Q(y) + Q(z) + Q(x + y + z) 6= 0 for any three distinct x; y; z; Q(x) + Q(y) + Q(z) + Q(x + a) + Q(y + a) + Q(z + a) 6= 0 if a 6= 0 (x; y; z arbitrary). We show that every crooked function gives rise to a distance regular graph of diameter 3 having = 0 and = 2 which is a cover of the complete graph. Our approach is a generalization of a recent construction found by de Caen, Mathon, and Moorhouse. We study graph-theoretical properties of the resulting graphs, including their automorphisms. Also we demonstrate a connection between crooked functions and bent functions.

Reference-contexts: Thus we get the examples constructed by de Caen et al. in <ref> [dCMM] </ref>. Actually, these are the only examples of crooked functions known at present. In particular, it is unknown if there exist crooked functions which don't come from a bilinear multiplication. <p> The proposition is proved. 2 We call graphs obtained from a crooked function by the above construction crooked graphs. Now we shall study structural properties of crooked graphs. We shall follow the lines of <ref> [dCMM] </ref> as far as possible; many of the arguments from that paper can be applied to our more general situation almost unchanged. It is evident that equivalent crooked functions give rise to isomorphic graphs; linear transformations of V and W result only in renaming the fibres, and vertices in fibres. <p> It is evident that equivalent crooked functions give rise to isomorphic graphs; linear transformations of V and W result only in renaming the fibres, and vertices in fibres. Let G = G Q be a crooked graph. Obviously, the parition of vertices into fibres is uniquely determined. Following <ref> [dCMM] </ref>, call a set of four fibres a quad iff their union contains a subgraph isomorphic to the 3-cube. As the graph induced on any four quads has valency 3, the 3-cube must be one of its connected components. <p> An easy calculation shows that they indeed form a quad of type (i). The last two claims of the proposition are taken unchanged from <ref> [dCMM, Lemma 2.6] </ref>. 2 Note that the quads inside a half determine on the fibres in this half the structure of an affine space; and the affine structures determined in this way on the two halves are identical, which means that we can consider them as a single affine structure on

Reference-contexts: A Kerdock code is a subcode of RM 2 , and with the above assumption it contains RM 1 . It has (length, size, minimum distance) parameters (2 n ; 2 2n ; 2 n1 2 n=21 ) | see <ref> [CvL, Chapter 12] </ref>, for example. <p> the electronic journal of combinatorics 5 (1998), #R34 9 Finally, the characteristic vectors of affine subspaces of dimension 3 generate the Reed-Muller code RM (n; n 3) the dimension of which is equal to 0 + n ! n 3 = 2 n 1 n n ! (see, for example, <ref> [CvL, Chapter 12] </ref>). A function Q 2 C is uniquely determined by n functions Q i : V ! GF (2), the coordinates of the values with respect to a basis of W .

Reference-contexts: Let A = AutG. The mappings s fl : (a; i; ff) ! (a; i; ff + fl), fl 2 W , are automorphisms of G, and comprise the whole kernel of the action of A on the fibres (see <ref> [GH, Lemma 7.3] </ref>); so the affine structure on each fibre is also uniquely determined.

Reference-contexts: Therefore n must be odd, and also the second equality of the proposition is proved. A similar argument proves the first equality. 2 As the sizes of the sets in Proposition 3 suggest, crooked functions are closely related to quadrics, or more generally to Rothaus' bent functions <ref> [R] </ref>, which we now explore. <p> Thus c Q a consists of four copies of the bent function Q a j U , except that the copy on U + a has been inverted (recall that Qj U and Qj U+a are complementary). Then c Q a is a bent function on W | see <ref> [R] </ref>, for example. So given a crooked function Q we can construct a closed quasibent Kerdock set fQ a g, and we'd like to extend these functions to form a closed bent Kerdock set the electronic journal of combinatorics 5 (1998), #R34 7 f c Q a g.
