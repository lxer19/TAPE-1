Abstract: An experimental information management system is developed to monitor system data for a network of workstations, a heterogeneous computing environment consisting of more than a hundred machines. The information system is designed to help system administration and research activities by managing system configurations and keeping track of system load history. It uses Informix database to store all the data and provide general SQL access. We integrated the information system with the existing system monitor to support system load visualization.

Reference-contexts: There are other ways to obtain the same plots. For example, a user can right-click the background of Netwreak and select Plot. Then, he/she can manually type in the name of any host or cluster depending what he/she wants to visualize. 6. Related Work Anderson, Goto, and Patterson <ref> [1] </ref> developed a system diagnostic console for the Networks of Workstations (NOW) to gather system usage data such as load, CPU, and memory on a single or a cluster of machines. Currently, the data is being discarded once it is being collected and displayed to the diagnostic console.

Reference-contexts: We extended the functionality of the NOW system monitor by setting up a database which will store previous load information into the database so that the data can be queried for future reference. UNIX Host Administration (UHA) system <ref> [2] </ref> also implemented a 7 data model in a database that tracks hardware and software configuration, users, and accounts. The system is developed to simplify common administrative tasks and improve the efficiency and integrity of processes that track users, accounts, and equipment in a scientific computing environment.
