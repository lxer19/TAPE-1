Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A number of interesting problems in computer vision and robotics involve finding the "optimal" rotation matrix in the set of rigid rotations SO (3) = fR 2 IR 3fi3 : R t R = I; det (R) = 1g <ref> [GO89, Hor90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Note that the process described above is almost identical to the procedure employed in standard Newtonian minimization algorithms <ref> [JS83] </ref>, the only real difference is that at each iteration of this procedure the quadratic approximation and the minimization step are expressed in terms of a local parameter system rather than a global one. <p> It can be shown that in a Euclidean parameter space, standard Newtonian minimization algorithms exhibit quadratic convergence when provided with a starting point sufficiently close to a minimum <ref> [JS83] </ref>. Steven Smith was able to show that the algorithm described above will also exhibit quadratic convergence on Riemannian manifolds like SO (3) [Smi93]. 2 An Example Consider the objective function given in equation (5).

Reference-contexts: Our solution is to forgo the global parameterization approach in favor of an atlas of local parameterizations. That is, at every point R 0 on the manifold SO (3) we construct a continuous, 2 A notable exception to this generalization is the work of Nadas <ref> [Nad78] </ref>. 1 invertible differentiable mapping between a neighborhood of R 0 on the manifold and an open set in IR 3 as shown in equation (2).

Reference-contexts: The general approach described above is identical to the one proposed recently by Steven Smith <ref> [Smi93] </ref> in his work on minimization on Riemanninan manifolds. However, this paper deals specifically with the special case of SO (3) and closely related manifolds rather than the more general problem discussed in Smith's thesis. <p> Steven Smith was able to show that the algorithm described above will also exhibit quadratic convergence on Riemannian manifolds like SO (3) <ref> [Smi93] </ref>. 2 An Example Consider the objective function given in equation (5). The maximum of this objective function corresponds to the rotation matrix that bring the vectors u i and v i into their best alignment.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the Lie group SO (3) is not isomorphic to the vector space IR 3 <ref> [Stu64] </ref>. This means that all of these global parameterizations will exhibit singularities or other anomalies at various points in the parameter space. These anomalies can cause serious problems for gradient based minimization procedures.

Reference-contexts: It may be possible to apply similar techniques to other Lie groups by taking advantage of their exponential operators. All of the parameterizations described in this paper have been successfully implemented as part of an actual structure from motion algorithm described in <ref> [TK94] </ref>. In this application, minimization based on the "standard" global parameterizations failed to converge in some situations, whereas the presented method never encounters the singularity issues that plagued these global parameterizations.
