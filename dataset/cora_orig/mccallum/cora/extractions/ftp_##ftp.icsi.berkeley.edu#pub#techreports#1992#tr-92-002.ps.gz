Reference-contexts: In this paper, these and similar ideas of handling inconsistent constraints are analyzed. In particular, we investigate the applicability of approaches in nonmonotonic reasoning to formalize different forms of constraint relaxation. The idea of distinguishing soft and hard constraints bears some resemblance to recent approaches of formalizing default reasoning <ref> [2, 11] </ref> where defaults are represented as standard first order formulas. To achieve the desired behavior of default reasoning, inconsistencies in the set of premises are resolved by disregarding some formulas (defaults) considered to be less important than others. <p> Constraint networks are extended by different orderings containing information about what to do in cases of inconsistencies. We discuss three such orderings. The first one is an ordering on maximal consistent subsets of the constraints and is a direct adaptation of the preferred subtheory approach in <ref> [2] </ref>. The next, more general approach introduces an ordering on the solutions of maximal consistent subsets of the constraints. The third further generalization admits arbitrary subsets of the constraints, not just maximal 1 ones. <p> Section 5 concludes. 2 Background In this section, we will introduce the basic notation and definitions underlying our treatment of inconsistent constraint networks. We will first present the standard constraint terminology restricting ourselves to finite constraint networks. We then reconsider the notion of preferred subtheories as defined in <ref> [2] </ref>. This approach to default reasoning will be used repeatedly in the next sections. <p> In this case, N 0 will be called a relaxation substitute of N . In the next section, we will discuss various ways of defining such substitutes. We will next define the nonmonotonic formalism used in the next sections to formalize reasoning with inconsistent constraints, Brewka's preferred subtheory approach <ref> [2] </ref>, which generalizes earlier work of [11]. This approach is based on an ordering of the maximally consistent subsets (subtheories) of a set of premises. <p> A formula p is weakly (strongly) provable from T iff it is provable from at least one (all) of the &lt;-minimal elements of Sub (T ). In <ref> [2] </ref>, various ways of generating the ordering of the subtheories from orderings of the premises of a given theory are investigated. For instance, it is shown that Poole's framework for default reasoning can be obtained by defining the preferred subtheories to be those containing a distinguished set of facts. <p> = S 1 [ : : : [ S n is a preferred subtheory of P iff for all i (1 i n) the set S 1 [ : : : [ S i is a maximally consistent subset of P 1 [ : : : [ P i . <ref> [2] </ref> contains a further generalization to arbitrary partial orderings of the premises. This extension is rather straightforward and will not be discussed in the present paper. <p> As mentioned before, <ref> [2] </ref> also describes a more general approach based on partial orderings of the premises instead of reliability levels. It uses total linearizations of the partial orderings. Its application to constraints is similar to the one above and will be omitted here.

It therefore seems appropriate to introduce a new notion of constraints where constraints are partial orderings on value assignments. <p> We therefore have to investigate other ways of representing orderings. One particularly convenient way of expressing priority orderings in constraint networks, is to introduce some kind of metric (see also <ref> [7] </ref>). We can, for instance, specify the quality of a value assignment by using integers interpreted as penalties, indicating the degree to which a particular value assignment violates the constraint.

Reference-contexts: In figure 2, we show a relaxed version for the room painting example with additional variables and the corresponding functional description. Standard constraint satisfaction algorithms like the one in <ref> [8] </ref> can be applied to the new constraint network. If all variables v c j have the value 0, we have found a solution where no constraint in the original problem is violated.

This definition leaves open how to define the ordering on the maximally consistent subsets. A solution in the spirit of <ref> [11] </ref> might distinguish between two classes of constraints: the hard constraints that have to be satisfied and the soft constraints that are only satisfied if possible. We will describe a more general approach here, which applies the ideas of level default theories as described in the last section.
