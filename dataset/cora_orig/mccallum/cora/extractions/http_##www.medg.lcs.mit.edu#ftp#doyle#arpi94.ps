Abstract: Major military operations and other large-scale activities naturally involve competitions for resources that must be managed effectively to ensure overall success. Since plan revisions may change the resource demands of the activity, the relevant competitions for resources involve computational resources (time, database control, etc.) as well as the more obvious non-computational resources (fuel, aircraft, etc.). Ideally, these conflicting demands should be resolved rationally in the sense of decision theory and economics. We determine rational allocations over the full range of resources by using an artificial market economy (implemented as RECON, the Reasoning ECONomy) to determine prices or trading ratios among resources. We represent tasks and goals as resource-endowed consumers and computational methods, informational resources, and reasoning procedures as resource-transforming producers. We then use the information provided by such problem-oriented market economies to guide search, planning, and revision procedures that automatically extend and revise the market structure itself, e.g., to include markets for solutions to new tasks and subtasks. This permits the market information to guide the choices of whether to revise plans, and which portions to revise if revisions are warranted.

Reference-contexts: Even in those efforts, the focus is on optimizing the non-computational properties of the plan without regard to the computational resources required to do so. Work by Russell and Wefald [28, 29] and others <ref> [1, 7, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] </ref> on rational allocation of computational effort in search has complemented this work on planning by studying optimal allocation of computation time in search, primarily in the simpler domain of game-playing search.

Reference-contexts: The specific mechanisms investigated to date, however, do not distinguish well the variety of computational resources and goals of interest. Our students Ronald Bodkin and Michael Frank investigated several ideas in rational guidance of search, developing some new search methods <ref> [2] </ref> and exposing severe problems with the assumptions underlying extant rational search procedures [16, 17]. While work on qualitative logics of preference goes back some time in philosophical logic [32, 33], work on the problem in artificial intelligence seems to originate with our contributions [39, 13].

Reference-contexts: In contrast, it is difficult, at least within traditional organizational structures, to recognize the need for a market in strategies to repair a transportation plan upon the closure of an airfield <ref> [4] </ref>, much less to identify the organizational agents that might appropriately enter into such a market. In consequence, traditional approaches to organizing large scale activities mix market and other mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: The early notion of contract net of Davis and Smith <ref> [5] </ref>, for example, appealed to market metaphors (i.e., bidding for contracts) without providing means for using prices in its protocols, and the "society of mind" theory of Minsky [27] takes a broad but informal view of mental structure and activity that subsumes market activity and many other forms of interaction.

Reference-contexts: Improving the choices of traditional planners has usually been viewed as a problem of bringing more knowledge to bear on the individual choices of methods for achieving each task <ref> [6] </ref>, and this has proved difficult as increasing complexity of the activity requires taking a larger and larger perspective in these choices. <p> To observe the system's behavior and perform preliminary tests of the implementation, we took the AMORD pattern-directed procedure system <ref> [6] </ref> and replaced its traditional RMS with MRMS. We also replaced AMORD's first-in, first-out queue of procedure invocations with the RECON producer-scheduling mechanism, and redescribed AMORD goals and methods in terms of computation consumers and producers.

Work by Russell and Wefald [28, 29] and others <ref> [1, 7, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] </ref> on rational allocation of computational effort in search has complemented this work on planning by studying optimal allocation of computation time in search, primarily in the simpler domain of game-playing search.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the primary means used to guide the planning and replanning process have been purely structural (how many goals achieved) or probabilistic (how likely the goals are achieved). Recent efforts on decision-theoretic planning and acting <ref> [8, 9, 11, 19, 31, 37] </ref> have attempted to employ utility information, but most planning methods in use remain fairly insensitive to this information.

Reference-contexts: Automatic planning systems supply means for making these identifications. Typical automatic planners take a set of tasks or goals and expand or refine the set by identifying methods for achieving some of these tasks or goals <ref> [9] </ref>. Now in fact, most planning systems do not stop there, but also search through different choices of which methods to use to achieve which goals, until a complete set of goals and corresponding methods is obtained that provides a comprehensive plan for achieving the initial goals. <p> Consequently, the primary means used to guide the planning and replanning process have been purely structural (how many goals achieved) or probabilistic (how likely the goals are achieved). Recent efforts on decision-theoretic planning and acting <ref> [8, 9, 11, 19, 31, 37] </ref> have attempted to employ utility information, but most planning methods in use remain fairly insensitive to this information.

Reference-contexts: MRMS reorganizes the operations of a traditional RMS <ref> [10] </ref> into local revisions that are done only upon determination of need, rather than the automatic and global revisions performed by traditional reason maintenance systems [14]. <p> Work on a related problem, that of constructing multiattribute utility functions that model important types of planning goals, has also been under investigation by Haddawy and Hanks [18, 19]. Most treatments of reason maintenance have followed the original <ref> [10] </ref> in performing complete updates, and theories of reasoned revisions have followed in making this sometimes impractical assumption. Our mathematical work on reasoned assumptions [12] provides a better understanding the properties of MRMS and more general reason maintenance systems that perform piecemeal revisions of their information.

Reference-contexts: In the first place, numeric utility functions are too specific: the foundations of decision theory and economics start with qualitative preference orders, and many different utility functions can represent the same preference order <ref> [30] </ref>. Thus a utility function may convey more information than is really there. In the second place, while utility functions make some optimization procedures convenient, they tend to make specification and elucidation of preferences difficult.

Work on a related problem, that of constructing multiattribute utility functions that model important types of planning goals, has also been under investigation by Haddawy and Hanks [18, 19].

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, it appears that many important decisions can be made simply on the basis of dominance arguments expressed completely qualitatively, so this approach should permit important decision-making and planning to proceed even without numeric utilities. Wellman <ref> [37] </ref> has developed the probabilistic version of this idea into a dominance-guided 7 planning procedure that plans "up to tradeoffs" in his terminology, meaning it constructs plans that are optimal as far as the qualitative probabilistic information is concerned, and we expect an even more robust planning procedure could be constructed <p> Consequently, the primary means used to guide the planning and replanning process have been purely structural (how many goals achieved) or probabilistic (how likely the goals are achieved). Recent efforts on decision-theoretic planning and acting <ref> [8, 9, 11, 19, 31, 37] </ref> have attempted to employ utility information, but most planning methods in use remain fairly insensitive to this information. Even in those efforts, the focus is on optimizing the non-computational properties of the plan without regard to the computational resources required to do so.

Reference-contexts: But the true flowering of computational markets has occurred only recently, mainly with the WALRAS computational economy developed by Wellman <ref> [38] </ref>. Designed to make use of the main ideas of theoretical economics about markets, WALRAS provides a general mechanism for implementing markets in arbitrary sets of goods, traded by arbitrary consuming and producing agents. <p> Our preliminary implementation of RECON is built in CLOS on top of Wellman's WALRAS artificial economy <ref> [38] </ref>. WALRAS provides the basic market notions of consumer and producer agents, goods, and auctions for these goods. Each consumer and producer enters into a subset of the auctions. Consumers are endowed (possess) bundles of various goods, and enter into the auctions for each of the goods in their endowment. <p> The more substantive recent efforts of Waldspurger and others [35] have focussed on allocating single goods, namely processor time in a distributed operating system. Wellman's WALRAS system <ref> [38] </ref>, upon which our current implementation is based, constitutes the first general and substantial use of market notions, providing a computational mechanism for finding overall equilibria of multi-good, multi-agent markets.

Reference-contexts: Toward this end, we have developed a qualitative logic of preference ceteris paribus or preference "other things equal" <ref> [13, 15, 39] </ref> in collaboration with Michael Wellman. The most common representation used or assumed for preference information is that of numerical utility functions. These have the advantage of offering complete comparisions of the relative desirability of all alternatives and of applying numerical optimization procedures in decision making. <p> While work on qualitative logics of preference goes back some time in philosophical logic [32, 33], work on the problem in artificial intelligence seems to originate with our contributions <ref> [39, 13] </ref>. However, this work has its roots in Wellman's earlier work on decomposition of multiattribute 8 utility functions [36], which we also further developed in [40].

Reference-contexts: language for encoding preference information would include quantitative representations as well, and we are working toward a preference language that spans the spectrum from completely qualitative representations like our language of comparative preference to ordinary numeric utility functions, including intermediate representations of multiattribute utility functions such as subutility composition trees <ref> [40] </ref>, the standard forms of multiattribute utility functions [25], and their application to expressing different types of planning goals [18, 19]. 6 Related work Work on distributed AI has made use of market notions for about a decade, but these uses have been more suggestive than substantive until very recently [26]. <p> However, this work has its roots in Wellman's earlier work on decomposition of multiattribute 8 utility functions [36], which we also further developed in <ref> [40] </ref>.
