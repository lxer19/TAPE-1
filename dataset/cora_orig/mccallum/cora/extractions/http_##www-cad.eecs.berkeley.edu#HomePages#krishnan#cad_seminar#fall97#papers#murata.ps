Abstract: The first and the most critical stage in VLSI layout design is the placement, the background of which is the rectangle packing problem: Given many rectangular modules of arbitrary size, place them without overlapping on a layer in the smallest bounding rectangle. Since the variety of the packing is infinite (two-dimensionally continuous) many, the key issue for successful optimization is in the introduction of a P-admissible solution space, which is a finite set of solutions at least one of which is optimal. This paper proposes such a solution space where each packing is represented by a pair of module name sequences. Searching this space by simulated annealing, hundreds of modules could be successfully packed as demonstrated. Combining a conventional wiring method, the biggest MCNC benchmark ami49 is challenged.

Reference-contexts: A packing of six modules is shown in Fig.1. It has been known that the decision problem [RP (H,W): Given a base-rectangle with height H and width W , determine if a given set M of modules can be packed] is NP-complete <ref> [1] </ref>. The decision version of our packing problem is [RP (A): Given a base-rectangle with area A, determine if a given set M of modules can be packed].

Reference-contexts: Therefore, our problem RP is harder than RP (A), so NP-hard. Since the height and width of modules are continuous real numbers, RP is not simply a combinatorial optimization problem.

Reference-contexts: The solution space that satisfies the above four requirements is called P-admissible. The reasons for (1),(3) and (4) are obvious. That for (2) is: most heuristics pick up one solution after another along the neighboring structure defined on the space <ref> [4] </ref>, consulting with the difference of evaluations (gain) to the previous solution. Therefore, if infeasible solutions are included, the continuity will be destroyed and the convergence to a feasible solution is not guaranteed.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, if infeasible solutions are included, the continuity will be destroyed and the convergence to a feasible solution is not guaranteed. A practically known solution space is the one derived from slicing floorplan proposed by Otten <ref> [5] </ref> and others. Because it satisfies (1), (2) and (3), and also because it has "safe routing" merit for channel routers [6], several optimization heuristics are applied for the space, and one of the most successful approaches uses simulated annealing [7].

The largest MCNC building-block benchmark is successfully placed by simulated annealing in about 30 minutes (Fig.9). This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a mapping from a given packing to a pair of module name sequences is given, to show that an optimal solution is included. <p> Similarly, left to, above, below relations between two modules are defined.

If x 0 2 M aa (x), then x 0 is right to x in . <p> T is the sum of wiring width and wiring space (obtained from a design rule set). We use following formulae to estimate the final chip width W 0 and height H 0 , which is the one proposed in <ref> [10] </ref>. W 0 = W + T H i2N W i The second term of each formula estimates the amount of increase in one direction owing to the wires, assuming all wires are uniformly distributed in the final chip. <p> In our system, this code for orientation and a sequence-pair are put together into a simulated annealing process, which runs in a similar fashon as rectangle packing optimization. The process searches the solution space of size (m!) 2 8 m . The point which is not mentioned in <ref> [10] </ref> is how the location of each individual module is calculated. After the best evaluated code is obtained, coordinates of each module is determined as follows.
