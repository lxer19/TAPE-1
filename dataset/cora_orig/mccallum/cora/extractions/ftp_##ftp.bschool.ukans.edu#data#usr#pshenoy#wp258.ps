Abstract: The main objectives of this note are to point out some strengths and some limitations of Kirkwoods algebraic method for decision problems, and to propose a modification to address the limitations. The modification is based on the valuation network technique, and it enables us to better relate Kirkwoods method to the graphical techniques of valuation networks and influence diagrams. Recently, Kirkwood [1993] has proposed an algebraic method for representing and solving large decision problems. The algebraic method is motivated by the need to avoid the exponential growth of decision tree representation in problems with many variables. Except for the compact tabular representation, Kirkwoods method follows closely the method of decision trees. The main objectives of this note are to point out some strengths and some limitations of Kirkwoods method, and to propose a modification of Kirkwoods method. Our motivation in proposing the modification is twofold. First, the limitations of Kirkwoods method are overcome by the modification. Second, while it is clear how Kirkwoods method relates to the decision tree technique, it is not obvious how Kirkwoods method relates to other graphical techniques such as influence diagrams [Howard and Matheson 1981] and valuation networks [Shenoy 1992]. The proposed modification is based on the valuation network representation technique, which is related to the influence diagram technique. Hence the proposed modification helps to better relate Kirkwoods method to valuation networks and influence diagrams. In Kirkwoods method, a decision problem is represented by a table having a row for each value of a decision variable and for each value of a chance variable in the problem. Thus the algebraic representation is compact as in the cases of influence diagrams and valuation networks. This is the main strength of Kirkwoods representation when compared with decision trees. In a decision problem with many variables, it is computationally intractable to represent the problem as a decision tree.
