Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recent advances in computing and communication technologies have made it feasible to design high performance, scalable multimedia servers which can provide a wide range of services to a large number of clients over high speed networks <ref> [1] </ref>. Due to the immensity of the sizes and the data transfer requirements of multimedia objects, such multimedia servers will undeniably be founded on large disk arrays. <p> Specif ically, if b r 1 ; b r N denote the number of media blocks required to be accessed from the disks during round r, then 8j 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref> : b r j 0 where j 0 = (j + k) mod N .

Reference-contexts: Most of the existing analytical as well as simulation models for analyzing the performance of synchronous and asynchronous arrays have presumed conventional workload (i.e., successive retrieval requests generated by the same process are assumed to be independent of each other) <ref> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] </ref>. On the contrary, since digital audio and video playback is inherently sequential, the set of disks accessed by a retrieval request is related to the one accessed by the previous request from the same client. <p> A media block is the unit of data interleaving among disks, and denotes the maximum amount of logically contiguous data that is stored on a single disk (this has also been referred to as the striping unit in the literature <ref> [2] </ref>). Successive media blocks are stored on consecutive disks in the array. Due to the periodic nature of media playback, a multimedia server can service multiple clients simultaneously by proceeding in rounds.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, since media streams may be encoded using variable rate compression techniques, the amount of information retrieved from the server during each round may vary from one client to another. Although several media compression algorithms have been proposed in the recent past <ref> [8] </ref>, very little work has been done in developing techniques for efficient retrieval of compressed multimedia objects from disk arrays.

Reference-contexts: We refer to a continuously recorded sequence of audio samples or video frames as a strand. A multimedia server can organize the storage of such media strands on a disk array in terms of fixed size media blocks <ref> [9] </ref>. A media block is the unit of data interleaving among disks, and denotes the maximum amount of logically contiguous data that is stored on a single disk (this has also been referred to as the striping unit in the literature [2]). <p> However, since new clients can be admitted for service by a multimedia server only at round boundaries <ref> [9] </ref>, increasing the duration of a round significantly increases the response time.
