Abstract: Many applications of knowledge discovery require the knowledge to be consistent with data. Examples include discovering rules for query optimization, database integration, decision support, etc. However, databases usually change over time and make machine-discovered knowledge inconsistent with data. Useful knowledge should be robust against database changes so that it is unlikely to become inconsistent after database changes. This paper defines this notion of robustness, describes how to estimate the robustness of Horn-clause rules in closed-world databases, and describes how the robustness estimation can be applied in rule discovery systems.

Reference-contexts: The probability that the outcome of the next experiment will be C can be estimated as r + 1 . A detailed description and a proof of the Laplace law can be found in <ref> (Howson & Urbach 1988) </ref>. The Laplace R1: ?latitude 35.89 ( geoloc ( , ,?country,?latitude, ) ^ ?country = "Malta". T1: One of the existing tuples of geoloc with its ?country = "Malta" is updated such that its ?latitude &lt; 35.89.

Reference-contexts: Many systems are now able to generate a set of Horn-clause rules from relational data. These systems include inductive logic programming systems (Lavrac & Dzeroski 1994; Raedt & Bruynooghe 1993), and systems that discover rules for semantic query optimization <ref> (Hsu & Knoblock 1994) </ref>. Instead of generating desired rules in one run, we propose to use these existing algorithms to generate rules, and then use a rule pruning algorithm to prune a rule so that it is highly robust and applicable (short).

Reference-contexts: We generalize them into a set of three transaction templates illustrated in Table 4. For a relational rule such as R2, the invalidating transactions are divided into another four general classes different from those for range rules. The complete templates are presented in detail in <ref> (Hsu & Knoblock 1996a) </ref>. These two sets of templates are sufficient for any Horn-clause rules on relational data. From the transaction templates, we can derive the templates of the equations to compute robustness estimation for each class of rules. <p> In those cases, our estimation templates will be instantiated into a small number of approximate estimates. As a result, the complexity of applying our templates for robustness estimation is always proportional to the length of rules <ref> (Hsu & Knoblock 1996a) </ref>. Empirical Demonstration We estimated the robustness of the sample rules on the database as shown in Table 1. This database stores information on a transportation logistic planning domain with twenty relations. Here, we extract a subset of the data with five relations for our experiment.

Reference-contexts: Table 1 shows the schema of an example database with five relations and their attributes. Table 1 also shows some Horn-clause rules describing the data. We adopt standard Prolog terminology and semantics as defined in <ref> (Lloyd 1987) </ref> in our discussion of rules. In addition, we refer to literals on database relations as database literals (e.g., seaport ( ,?glc cd,?storage, , , )) and literals on built-in relations as built-in literals (e.g., ?latitude 35.89). We distinguish two classes of rules.

Reference-contexts: The robustness of r in accessible states from the current state d is defined as Robust (rjd) = Pr (:tjd) = 1 Pr (tjd). This definition of robustness is analogous in spirit to the notion of accessibility and the possible worlds semantics in modal logic <ref> (Ramsay 1988) </ref>. If the only way to change database states is by transactions, and all transactions are equally probable to be performed, then the two definitions of robustness are equivalent.
