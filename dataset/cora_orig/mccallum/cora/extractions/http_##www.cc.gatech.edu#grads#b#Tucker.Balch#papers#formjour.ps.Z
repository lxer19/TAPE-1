Abstract: New reactive behaviors that implement formations in multi-robot teams are presented and evaluated. The formation behaviors are integrated with other navigational behaviors to enable a robotic team to reach navigational goals, avoid hazards and simultaneously remain in formation. The behaviors are implemented in simulation, on robots in the laboratory and aboard DARPA's HMMWV-based Unmanned Ground Vehicles. The technique has been integrated with the Autonomous Robot Architecture (AuRA) and the UGV Demo II architecture. The results demonstrate the value of various types of formations in autonomous, human-led and communications-restricted applications, and their appropriateness in different types of task environments.

Reference-contexts: An additional background schema, noise, serves as a form of reactive "grease", dealing with some of the problems endemic to purely reactive navigational methods such as local maxima, minima and cyclic behavior <ref> [1] </ref>. Each schema generates a vector representing the desired behavioral response (direction and magnitude of movement) given the current sensory stimuli provided by the environment. A gain value is used to indicate the relative importance of the individual behaviors. <p> The gains and other schema parameters used for the experimental simulations reported in this article are listed in Table I. The Appendix contains information on the specific computation of the individual schemas used in this research. See <ref> [1] </ref> for a complete discussion of the computational basis of motor schema-based navigation. Once the desired formation position is known, the maintain-formation motor schema generates a movement vector towards it.

Reference-contexts: A formation expert software tool was developed and integrated into the UGV Demo II architecture which provides the operator a graphical user-interface for the selection of formation types and parameters. This rule-based system drew both on the recommendations of military personnel and doctrine as presented in U.S. Army manuals <ref> [3] </ref>. The operator uses this tool to determine what formations fit the task confronting him. Performance in these tests was limited by a communications system that induced up to 7 seconds of latency in robot to robot position reports.

Reference-contexts: If it is very far off heading, the robot will quickly fall out of position either laterally, fore-aft or both. A technique used by pilots for aircraft formation <ref> [9] </ref> is well suited for this task: positioning is decomposed into fore-aft and side-side corrections. Fore-aft corrections are made by adjusting speed only, while lateral corrections are made by adjusting heading only. Each correction is applied independently.

Reference-contexts: A behavior may actually cast several votes for separate headings at once, where the votes are spread about a central angle with a Gaussian distribution. In speed voting, the lowest speed vote always wins. Details on the mathematical formation of the arbitration process are available in <ref> [11] </ref>. One strength of the formation behaviors lies in their ability to be easily reformulated for this and other alternate behavior-based coordination methods. As in the case of motor schema-based robots, the UGVs must simultaneously navigate to a goal position, avoid collisions with hazards and remain in formation.

Reference-contexts: This same discussion applies to when there are multiple corridors in front of the robots or other similar conditions. A. Motor Schema Results in Simulation Results were generated using Georgia Tech's MissionLab robot simulation environment <ref> [12] </ref>. MissionLab 1 runs on Unix machines (SunOS and Linux) using the X11 graphical windowing system. The simulation environment is a 1000 by 1000 meter two dimensional field upon which various sizes and distributions of circular obstacles can be scattered.
