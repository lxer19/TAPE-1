Abstract: The deployment of gigabit networks and broadband services has started to support multimedia applications, however, these gigabit networks are rarely saturated since only a few applications are able to stress the network. We consider a future scenario where the use of multimedia applications, such as audio and video teleconferencing in a multi-user environment, is expected to grow rapidly. Therefore, both customers and network providers, need to foresee the performance and behavior of the network and the applications in this scenario. From the customer's point of view, it is important to develop procedures to perform traffic measurements and to be able to test the local ATM equipment. In this paper we propose a method to introduce heavy load into an ATM switch and at the User Network Interface (UNI) for studying the performance and forecast evolved scenarios. In the experiments we use local equipment (ATM switch and workstations), local network management applications and diagnostics software. The emulated load is generated in a workstation, introduced into the ATM switch and intensified by replicating and re-circulating the cells. The method presented is an easy and affordable way for performance testing and an alternative to traffic modeling. Several experiments have been performed and the measurements obtained are presented.

Reference-contexts: Permanent VPs are used because signaling is not yet implemented by manufacturers and the testbed participants use equipment from different vendors. However, signaling will be available in the future implementing the ATM Forum UNI 3.1 <ref> [ATMF-UNI] </ref>. Because of PVC table limitations within the switch of the service provider each site can only connect up to four workstations. These may be connected either directly or through a local ATM switch.

Reference-contexts: Port 15 is connected to the ATM network UNI provided by the carrier using a single-mode fiber. Figure 2 presents this scenario. The Network Management Application (NMA) for the SynOptics switch [NMA] is an extension to the SunNet Manager [SNMRF], [SNMUR], [SNMPG], and uses the Connection Management Services application <ref> [CMS] </ref>. NMA allows to setup the connections for the ATM switch, both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint, to measure the bandwidth used and buffer occupancy for each port, and to retrieve the cell counters of transmitted, received, and dropped cells per each port and VC.

Reference-contexts: The network offers an access rate of 155 Mbps. (SONET OC-3c) and the service provided is on a best effort basis; hence there are no QoS guarantees.

The "Classical IP over ATM" approach defined in [RFC1577] is used. Also, [RFC1483] and [RFC1626] will be followed.

Reference-contexts: TCP traffic between local hosts The last experiment intends to measure the throughput of a TCP connection between workstations 1 and 2 when cell losses occur in between. A simulation study of TCP connections over ATM that share one output link on an ATM switch has been presented in <ref> [ROFL94] </ref>. They show the effective throughput for different packet lengths and switch buffer sizes. The effective throughput drops to very low values (of about 30%) for small switch buffers and long packets. <p> In order to get correct results, we have to adjust the TCP timers as suggested in <ref> [ROFL94] </ref> and we cannot vary the switch buffer size. For this experiment a bulk TCP transfer is setup between workstations 1 and 2. In this first case we use standard TCP without modifying the timers and with a buffer of 64 Kbytes and a packet length of 8192 bytes.
