Abstract: We specify a model-theoretic semantics for defaults in terminological logics using Shoham's framework of preference semantics. The semantics contains specificity as a precedence criteria between defaults and yields a disjunctive skepticism in case of non-resolvable conflicts. The primary aim of the semantics is the default entailment of descriptions. We indicate, however, several possibilities of an extension towards default subsumption. To establish a connection between the semantics and the actual computation of inferences we introduce the syntactic notions of default spaces and conflicts. We show that they provide a sound though not complete syntactic characterization of default entailment. We also sketch the integration of an additional precedence criterion, namely anteriority, and give a fixed-point characterization of preferential entail ment.

Reference-contexts: Thus, even though the concept 8 r:c 1 is not subsumed by c 1 itself, it contains c 1 embedded in a quantificational restriction. To deal with this issue, rule application can be either restricted to explicitly mentioned role-rillers like in CLASSIC. It seems that the results presented in <ref> [Baader, Hollunder 92] </ref> and [Donini et al. 92] can be used to specify a semantics for this conception of rules (Peter Patel-Schneider, personal communication). Alternatively, rules can be applied to embedded concepts as specified in [Schild 89] an implemented in BACK. <p> Though there is no object-name denoting this filler we get the expected D-entailment, since we use the domain D and not the object-names themselves to determine the exceptions. We thus avoid skolemization on the sematic level and the severe problems investigated in <ref> [Baader, Hollunder 92] </ref>. d E 1 ffi 1 : c 1 ; c 2 M 2 : c 2 fdg To deal with the problem on a syntactic level we propose the following lifting strategy: Definition 9 Let ffi 1 , ffi 2 be any defaults. ffi 2 is directly lifted <p> There is another source of incompleteness, however, namely lifting. In order to remedy this shortcoming we would have to characterize a lifting-completion for a set of defaults. Alternatively, we could integrate some kind of skolemization. Due to the arguments presented in Sec tion 3.2 and <ref> [Baader, Hollunder 92] </ref>, however, we think this will be a rather non-trivial task. We think that our syntactic characterization has some justification on its own: it is comparatively easy and complies with the semantics in case of binary, transitive conflicts.

Reference-contexts: Thus exceptions refer to the individuals of the underlying domain. Furthermore, we assume the usual Unique Name Assumption, reflected in the stipulation that interpretation functions I map object-names injectively into D. We thus compare what Bossu and Siegel call discriminant models <ref> [Bossu, Siegel 85] </ref>. We now define exceptions and fulfillers of defaults: Definition 3 Let ffi be any default and M any structure with domain D.

Reference-contexts: To avoid this problem the semantics of rules can be weakened as shown in [Schild 89]. Thus, the TL-systems BACK [Quantz, Kindermann 90] and CLASSIC <ref> [Brachman et al. 91] </ref> treat rules not as material implications but as forward-chaining rules. LOOM [MacGregor 91], on the other hand, treats rules (though not defaults) as material implications, and we think that this is the intuitively correct interpretation.

Reference-contexts: It corresponds to an aggregation of the precedence relation between exceptional defaults. This kind of aggregation is called elitism aggregation in <ref> [Cayrol et al. 92] </ref> and proved to yield a partial pre-ordering provided that the underlying precedence relation is bounded, i.e. has no infinite strictly increasing chains. This is clearly the case in the context of TL if we consider finitely many defaults and finite domains. <p> The essential difference comes from the particular handling of lifted default links. 6 It is easy to show that the definition of anteriority-preference is monotonic wrt to the anteriority pre-ordering between defaults. Thus extending the anteriority relation diminishes the number of preferred models. See <ref> [Cayrol et al. 92] </ref> for details on this point. Definition 26 A set E of TL-formulas is a default extension of G and D iff E is a maximal consistent set of TL-formulas containing G verifying the following closure conditions : 1. <p> Resulting default extensions then can be shown to be anteriority preferred, in a sense similar to the definition of anteriority preference between models (knowledge sets are considered instead of models). The proof relies upon general results stated in <ref> [Cayrol et al. 92] </ref>. The problem of computing default extensions on a given anteriority stratum still remains, however.

Reference-contexts: In other words, if M 2 contains an exception which is no exception in M 1 this exception must be justified by being an exception at a preceded default. Note that exception-preference captures the classical minimization principle of Circumscription, namely the minimization of the extensions of abnormality predicates <ref> [McCarthy 86, Gelfond et al. 89] </ref>. Our exception preference indeed minimizes the exception sets. Proposition 1 Let G be any set of TL-formulas, M 1 and M 2 any discriminant models of G over the same domain D, and D any set of Defaults.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, entailment of descriptions can be reduced to entailment of subsumption. From an implementation oriented perspective, however, special algorithms are needed for processing different types of queries in order to guarantee efficient performance (confer, for example, <ref> [Kindermann 90] </ref> for the issue of retrieval). Definitions, descriptions, and rules can only be used to model strict knowledge about a domain. In most applications, however, arises the need to model rules that are not strict but allow for exceptions. <p> As a consequence, a simple forward-chaining algorithm testing which premises of rules are subsumers of a concept and then adding there conclusions is incomplete (it misses contraposition, for example). To avoid this problem the semantics of rules can be weakened as shown in [Schild 89].

We think that the 2 The revision task is related to the general problem of revising descriptions. Kindermann has investigated this problem in <ref> [Kindermann 92] </ref>. framework of terminological logics provides specificity as a straightforward criterion for conflict resolution. In order to define this notion we start with a definition of defaults: Definition 1 A default ffi has the form c 1 ; c 2 where c 1 and c 2 are arbitrary concepts.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, each definition imposes stronger conditions on redundancy than its predecessor. The last definition corresponds to Morreau's definition of default entailment and has some desirable logical properties (e.g., monotonicity) <ref> [Morreau 92] </ref>. We suppose, however, that the strong restrictions imposed by it will hardly yield any redundancies at all. We make no choice for a particular definition of redundancy in this paper. Rather we indicate the relevant aspects for redundancy. <p> :: c 1 u :c 2 6j= fffi 1 g o :: c 3 o :: c 1 u :c 2 j= fffi 1 ;ffi 2 ;ffi 3 g o :: c 3 Morreau uses this example to distinguish between theories that view defaults as inference tickets and normalcy theories <ref> [Morreau 92] </ref>. Obviously, our theory belongs to the former group. Another important issue for redundancy is the precedence relation between defaults. Thus, adding a default will have consequences, if it precedes some other default.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, we will focus on inferences on the object level, whereas much literature has stressed default consequences on the terminological level (e.g., <ref> [Padgham 89] </ref>). Note that, because of their rule-format, defaults inherit all the problems inherent in rules, in particular the problem of disjunction and the lifting problem.

Reference-contexts: Note that, because of their rule-format, defaults inherit all the problems inherent in rules, in particular the problem of disjunction and the lifting problem. We will deal with these issues in detail in Section 3. 1 This format of defaults in terminological logics was first proposed by Pfahringer in <ref> [Pfahringer 89] </ref>. Our conception of defaults has rather drastic consequences for the status of conflicts in TR-systems. In the current BACK-system conflicting information is simply rejected.

Reference-contexts: Sub-sumption between concepts can be lifted to subsumption between quantified concepts (cf. <ref> [Royer, Quantz 92] </ref>): c 1 v c 2 j= 8r : c 1 v 8r : c 2 c 1 v c 2 j= nr : c 2 v nr : c 1 The exchange of c 1 and c 2 in the last entailment is due to n being a <p> v 8r : c 2 c 1 v c 2 j= nr : c 2 v nr : c 1 The exchange of c 1 and c 2 in the last entailment is due to n being a M ON # quantifier, whereas 8 and n are M ON" (cf. <ref> [Quantz 92] </ref>). This is important since algorithms have to expand the concepts when computing consequences of rules. Thus, even though the concept 8 r:c 1 is not subsumed by c 1 itself, it contains c 1 embedded in a quantificational restriction. <p> It might turn out that complex conflicts which can be constructed in theory do not occur frequently in practical applications and that hence incomplete algorithms are useful enough. Moreover an investigation on the usability of defaults in machine translations <ref> [Schmitz, Quantz 92] </ref>, has shown that in this application defaults should be seen as constraints rather than inference rules. Instead of applying defaults and resolving conflicts the system should return the defaults violated by certain descriptions.
