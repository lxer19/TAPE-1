Reference-contexts: To our knowledge, advance reservation services are not available within any of the existing or proposed schemes for real-time communication (see for example <ref> [1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11] </ref>). This paper presents a scheme for advance reservations of real-time connections. It is organized in the following manner. Section 2 discusses the service requirements for advance reservations. <p> The service model in the existing proposals and realizations of real-time communication services, including that in the Tenet Suite 1 <ref> [1] </ref>, assumes that real-time channels are requested fl Now with Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica, Universita degli Studi di Napoli "Federico II", Napoli, Italy.

Reference-contexts: Our measurements show that this overhead is usually less than 1 ms per server on a 12 SPECmarks (SPEC 92int) SUN SS IPC <ref> [2] </ref>. We also see, in the second graph, that the acceptance rate decreases slightly as we increase the time granularity. However, this lower acceptance rate may be due to the assumptions made in the simulations that the start times are completely random within a small time interval.

Reference-contexts: This complication can be avoided, and the establishment of immediate channels still kept as fast as possible, by separating the two types of channels so that the admission tests for a new channel only take into account the channels of its type in each server. Resource partitioning <ref> [5, 7] </ref> a service the Tenet Suite 2 will offer network managers, is an almost perfect solution for this problem. The immediate partition treats any new request exactly as described in [6].

Reference-contexts: This disadvantage is a very serious one, so serious that we believe it cannot be ignored. In our design, immediate channels will normally be created with an indefinite duration. In the establishment of immediate channels, which in the scheme described in <ref> [6] </ref> only considers the situation at the time the request is made, we must now look at all the future situations as well: Figure 1 shows a case in which no immediate channel can be created at time t 1 even though the resource in question is fully available at that <p> Resource partitioning [5, 7] a service the Tenet Suite 2 will offer network managers, is an almost perfect solution for this problem. The immediate partition treats any new request exactly as described in <ref> [6] </ref>. The advance partition must instead use a different mechanism (to be presented below) to test new requests for admission.

The partition-based solution raises, however, a problem: each resource has to be allocated statically to each partition, and this may cause inefficiencies due to resource fragmentation <ref> [7] </ref> and, worse, to poor allocation decisions; one of the two partitions for a resource may be saturated while the other is almost empty.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents a scheme for advance reservations of real-time connections. It is organized in the following manner. Section 2 discusses the service requirements for advance reservations. In Section 3, we describe the distributed advance reservations mechanisms we have designed for, and are implementing in, the Tenet Suite 2 <ref> [8] </ref>. Our mechanisms, however, should be easily portable to other approaches and protocols for real-time communication. <p> A multicast real-time channel ("channel") is characterized in the Tenet Scheme 2 by a quadruple of traffic parameters and, for each destination, a quadruple of QoS parameters <ref> [8] </ref>. When a client wants to set up a channel, it invokes the Real-Time Channel Administration Protocol (RCAP) and passes to it suitable identifiers for the source and the destinations, as well as the source's traffic parameters and each destination's QoS parameters.
