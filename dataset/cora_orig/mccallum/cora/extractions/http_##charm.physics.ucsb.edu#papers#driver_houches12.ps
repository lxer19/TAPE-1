Reference-contexts: The CLEO II and ARGUS measurements are averaged over the B 0 and B , while the LEP measurements are averaged over the b hadrons produced in Z ! b b. Full references to these measurements are given in Ref. <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> Table 11 lists the values of B SL obtained from the ARGUS, CLEO II dilepton analyses, as well as those measured at LEP. In computing the LEP average, I assumed <ref> [2] </ref> a common systematic of 0:25% (ab solute). The discrepancy between (4S) and LEP measurements is not very large, but the LEP results have always been systematically somewhat higher, even though the presence of b baryons should very slightly decrease the semileptonic branching fraction.

Reference-contexts: All B branching fractions in the table are from CLEO [101,102,5,108]. Recent world averages for B semileptonic branching fractions are given in Drell [103]. The D ! K (fl) e- branching fractions are taken from the Particle Data Book <ref> [4] </ref>, and the D ! e- and D ! e- branching fractions are my averages based on CLEO, E653, E791, E687, and Mark III measurements. <p> One more significant figure is quoted in the references, and a detailed breakdown of contributions to the uncertainties is given. The uncertainties are somewhat correlated due to common D and D fl branching fractions. The J= K (fl) branching fractions are from the 1997 Particle Data Book <ref> [4] </ref>. All confidence levels are at 90%.

Reference-contexts: The CLEO II measurement <ref> [5] </ref> of B ! ` and B ! ` is unusual in that it relies on the very good solid-angle coverage (her-meticity) of the detector to associate the neutrino momentum with the missing momentum in the event: (E -; p -) = (jp miss j; p miss ); (7.90) where p <p> For the vector modes, the fine cross-hatch shows the ! vector cross-feed and the single hatch shows the vector ! vector cross-feed.

Reference-contexts: Lingel, Skwarnicki, and Smith [138] have written a review of rare decays from an experimental perspective; recent theoretical reviews include those by Buras and Fleischer <ref> [12] </ref> and Ali [139]. In this section, we consider three types of rare decays: * Hadronic decays resulting from b ! u transitions. <p> The dominant contribution is expected to arise from the t-quark intermediate state, but effects from the c quark are not necessarily negligible. Buras and Fleischer <ref> [12] </ref> discuss this point in detail. The gluonic penguins are of interest not only as one-loop processes, but also because they are relevant to studies of CP violation. <p> There has been a heroic theoretical effort to calculate the standard-model prediction to next-to-leading order in QCD; this work involved many groups and was completed in 1996. A review with references is given by Buras and Fleischer <ref> [12] </ref>. At the same time, there have been intensive experimental investigations. Currently the branching fraction for the exclusive decay B ! K fl fl has been mea Heavy-Quark Physics and CP Violation 165 Fig. 68. The decay B ! K 0 has a penguin contribution (left). <p> In these lectures, however, I will only be able to scratch the surface of the subject.

In the standard model, these amplitudes are completely dominated by the box diagrams with t t.

Reference-contexts: case: experimental or theoretical? * What can we learn from the semileptonic branching fraction (as opposed to the semileptonic rate)? Are the values of the semileptonic branching fractions in B and D decay understood?

Dynamics of semileptonic decay I will begin with a qualitative picture of the dynamics of the semilep-tonic decay M !

D fl ` decays, which we have generated using HQET-based form-factor parameters given by Neubert <ref> [36] </ref>. (These predicted values are quite similar to those measured by CLEO [49]; this measurement is discussed below in the section on exclusive semileptonic decays.)

Two papers by Isgur and Wise [56,57] played a major role in synthesizing and extending this development, and they are among the most frequently cited papers in particle physics over the last few years.

Reference-contexts: The primary lepton spectrum is usually described by models, and the uncertainty in the predicted shapes produces the dominant uncertainty in the measurement. For this reason, we turn to an alternative measurement technique for measuring B SL . The ARGUS collaboration <ref> [77] </ref> introduced a method, based on charge correlations in dilepton events, that allows one to separate the contributions of primary and secondary leptons without relying on model-dependent shapes.

Reference-contexts: The ARGUS collaboration [77] introduced a method, based on charge correlations in dilepton events, that allows one to separate the contributions of primary and secondary leptons without relying on model-dependent shapes. This technique, which has now been used by CLEO <ref> [78] </ref> as well, substantially reduces the need for models in the determination of B SL . The first step is to require that one lepton (the "tagging lepton") have high momentum, so that it must nearly always be primary.

Reference-contexts: In the following discussion, I will present results for B ! D` and B ! D fl ` more or less in parallel, since the form factors for these modes are related in HQET, and both are used to extract jV cb j. CLEO II analysis <ref> [101] </ref>. This measurement used a technique in which the momentum of the neutrino is estimated from the missing momentum in the event. One can then compute E and the beam-energy constrained B mass for each candidate, as discussed in Sec. 4 (Eq. 4.1 and Eq. 4.2). <p> From Ref. <ref> [101] </ref>. We have already seen the mild w dependence of the B ! D` form factor in Fig. 27. Experimentally, there is very little sensitivity to any w dependence beyond the linear term of the Taylor expansion of the form factor about the zero-recoil point. <p> The agreement among these values is reasonably good, indicating that at the low values of q 2 (fast recoil) at which these hadronic decays occur, factorization provides a good description of the process. The data for the comparison with B ! D` are taken from the CLEO <ref> [101] </ref>, while the B ! D fl ` - comparison is made using combined CLEO and ARGUS data compiled in Browder et al. [112].

In reality, the D fl+ ` sample is (87 4)% pure, and the D 0 ` is (75 5)% pure, so these distributions are fit simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: A model is needed to account for possible feed-down contributions from various D flfl ` modes. In spite of these complications, ALEPH achieves a very good systematic error on these measurements: t B 0 = (1:61 0:07 0:04) ps and t B = (1:58 0:09 0:04) ps. DEL-PHI <ref> [132] </ref> reports a very precise result t (B 0 ) = (1:5320:0410:040) ps based on a study of B 0 ! D fl+ X` decays. Their measurement uses a method in which the D fl+ ! D 0 + decay is reconstructed inclusively, leading to a sample of 3500 decays.

Reference-contexts: In hadron colliders, however, a sufficiently large number of B mesons is produced for decays to final states with J= 's to provide a competitive method for measuring lifetimes. Figure 62 shows the reconstructed B + mass from CDF <ref> [133] </ref> for the final states J= K + , J= K fl+ , (2S)K + , and (2S)K fl+ .

Reference-contexts: Because charm particles have Cabibbo-favored c ! s decays, however, rare modes tend to have smaller branching fractions, and it is more difficult to achieve a comparable sensitivity to exotic processes than it is in B decays.

Reference-contexts: In CLEO, the dE=dx separation between kaons and pions at this momentum is only 1:7. Until recently, both CLEO and the LEP experiments have only been able to report measurements of the sum of the two modes. Table 24 lists a set of new CLEO II measurements <ref> [140] </ref>, based on a sample of 3.3 million B B pairs, of B ! , B ! K, and B ! KK modes in various charge states. <p> E is the detection efficiency. The errors on B are statistical, fit systematics, and efficiency systematics respectively.

Reference-contexts: A number of other rare B decay modes have now been observed. The most striking are B + ! 0 K + and B 0 ! 0 K 0 ; whose branching fractions <ref> [141] </ref> are listed in Table 25.

Reference-contexts: The famous CP T theorem states that all relativistic quantum-field theories must possess symmetry under the combined CP T operation, so that CP violation implies a compensating T violation. Both effects have now been observed in neutral K decays <ref> [148] </ref>, while no CP T violation is seen. CP violation was discovered [149] at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) in 1964, well before there was a theoretical framework, let alone a prediction, to guide experimentalists.

CP violation and cosmology In 1967, Sakharov <ref> [162] </ref> noted that CP violation has an important connection to cosmology, because it is one of three conditions necessary to generate an asymmetry between the number of baryons and antibaryons in the universe and therefore to explain the preponderance of matter over antimatter that we observe today.

Reference-contexts: T. D. Lee has presented <ref> [165] </ref> some interesting observations regarding the charge asymmetry in Eq. 9.97. Before meeting each other, the representatives of two civilizations from different parts of the universe decide that it would be prudent to determine whether their definitions of matter and antimatter were the same.

These experiments measure the time dependence of mixing (Eq. 9.106) using high-precision vertex detectors to measure the B decay distance, which is then converted into the proper decay 202 J.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the contribution from (4S) ! B + B decays must be accounted for. Nevertheless, this method has produced precise results, and it was the method used by ARGUS for the discovery of B 0 B 0 mixing <ref> [167] </ref>. We will see in the following section that when a B 0 and B 0 are produced at the (4S), their time evolution is correlated: until one or the other particle decays, their oscillations cannot produce a B 0 B 0 or B 0 B 0 system.

Reference-contexts: A useful summary of the statistical requirements of the CP asymmetry measurements using the interference between mixing and decay has been presented by Cassel <ref> [168] </ref>.
