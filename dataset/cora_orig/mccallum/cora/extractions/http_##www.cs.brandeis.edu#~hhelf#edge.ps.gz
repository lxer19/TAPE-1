Reference-contexts: Until now, there was no other board for which the probabilities of all local patterns were known. Many experiments and some important partial results <ref> [1] </ref> had shown that, as already stated, the probabilities of patterns in the Aztec diamond depend on location. This qualitative difference between the Aztec diamond and the rectangular board made the former as worthy of analysis as the latter.

Reference-contexts: At the end it will become clear that this assumption involves no loss of generality. One of our tools for attacking the special case d 0 &gt; 0, d 1 &gt; 0 will be the EKLP Lemma, a classical result in <ref> [3] </ref> which we will soon explain. First of all, we must define two kinds of subsets of the Aztec diamond. They will be our intermediate objects of study. Definition 2. <p> We will now be able to prove the following by induction. The proof in <ref> [3] </ref> does not use Lemma 3 explicitly. 18 Lemma 2 (EKLP Lemma).

Reference-contexts: a pattern removed, divided by the number of tilings of the board. 4 order 4, as a board order 4, as a graph of Aztec diamond of order (side) 20 of Aztec diamond of order 40 5 of Aztec diamond of order 60 of Aztec diamond of order 80 Kasteleyn <ref> [5] </ref> showed that the number of tilings of a board can be expressed as the absolute value of a determinant with half as many rows as there are squares in the board.

Reference-contexts: In random tilings of the Aztec diamond, we usually find brick-wall patterns outside the inscribed circles, and more complicated behavior inside the circle. (See figures 9 to 13.) The probabilities of local patterns in a rectangular board were computed recently <ref> [6] </ref>. Until now, there was no other board for which the probabilities of all local patterns were known. Many experiments and some important partial results [1] had shown that, as already stated, the probabilities of patterns in the Aztec diamond depend on location. <p> The main result of this work is an expression for the probability of any local pattern in a random tiling of the Aztec diamond. The expression is a determinant of size proportional to the number of squares in the pattern, just like Kenyon's expression <ref> [6] </ref> for the probabilities in the rectangural board, Main Result 1.
