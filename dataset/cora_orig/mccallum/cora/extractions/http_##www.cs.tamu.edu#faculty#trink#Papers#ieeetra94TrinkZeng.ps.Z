Abstract: Planning the motion of bodies in contact requires a model of contact mechanics in order to predict sliding, rolling, and jamming. Such a model typically assumes that the bodies are rigid and that tangential forces at the contacts obey Coulomb's law. Though, usually assumed to be constant, the static and dynamic coefficients of friction vary in space and time and are difficult to measure accurately. In this paper, we study a quasistatic, multi-rigid-body model for planar systems, in which the coefficients of friction are treated as independent variables. Our analysis yields inequalities defining regions in the space of friction coefficients for which a particular contact mode (i.e., a particular combination of sliding, rolling, or separating at the contacts) is feasible. The geometrical interpretation of these inequalities leads to a simple graphical technique to test contact mode feasibility. This technique is then used to generate a nontrivial example in which several contact modes are simultaneously feasible. Despite model ambiguity, there are factors which argue in favor of using a quasistatic, rigid-body model. This point is highlighted by the successful application of our results to the planning of two manipulation tasks.

The formulation given above is a generalization of their result to cases with more contacts and relates system stability directly to joint efforts. This is an advantage, because joint efforts are directly controllable in manipulator. 4.5 Regions in -Space for Modes 4S, 5S, ...

Reference-contexts: If the bodies are assumed rigid and the friction forces obey Coulomb's Law, then the motion of the system cannot always be uniquely predicted (see for example see <ref> [2, 13, 24] </ref>). If, on the other hand, the bodies are assumed to be compliant, then the motion of the system and the contact forces can always be uniquely predicted [11, 43]. This feature is desirable when it comes to simulation and planning. <p> This results in a system of differential algebraic equations and inequalities in the contact forces and the accelerations of the bodies (for example, see <ref> [2, 13, 37] </ref>). Next one differentiates the nonpenetration constraints twice with respect to time to write them in terms of the system's unknown accelerations. <p> For example, the three-dimensional, frictionless, quasistatic problem may be formulated as a linear program [41], while the analogous dynamic problem cannot. It can be formulated as a positive definite linear complementarity problem or equivalent positive definite quadratic program <ref> [2] </ref>. In the frictional case with sliding and rolling contacts, both problems become significantly more difficult to solve. <p> An example of a quasistatic problem with multiple solutions is discussed in Subsection 4.3. The predominant approach to dealing with model inconsistencies has been to ignore them, since they appear to be quite rare <ref> [2, 31] </ref>. Indeterminacies are more common and have 4 been dealt with in manipulation planning by delimiting all such situations and then avoiding them [7].

Reference-contexts: The predominant approach to dealing with model inconsistencies has been to ignore them, since they appear to be quite rare [2, 31]. Indeterminacies are more common and have 4 been dealt with in manipulation planning by delimiting all such situations and then avoiding them <ref> [7] </ref>.

Also, Erdmann stated (on page 251 of <ref> [7] </ref>) ...when the edges of the individual friction cones which comprise a composite friction cone are not coplanar, then a variety of reaction forces can arise in response to an applied force. Effectively, the distribution of reaction forces among the points of contact is indeterminate.

Reference-contexts: If the bodies are assumed rigid and the friction forces obey Coulomb's Law, then the motion of the system cannot always be uniquely predicted (see for example see <ref> [2, 13, 24] </ref>). If, on the other hand, the bodies are assumed to be compliant, then the motion of the system and the contact forces can always be uniquely predicted [11, 43].

Next one differentiates the nonpenetration constraints twice with respect to time to write them in terms of the system's unknown accelerations. <p> Parameter uncertainty exaggerates this problem. The models can also be inconsistent even when the kinematic constraints by themselves are not. For example, a rigid rod in one-point contact with a rigid table can have zero, one, two, or three finite force solutions under the dynamic model <ref> [13] </ref> and no solution at all in the quasistatic case. An example of a quasistatic problem with multiple solutions is discussed in Subsection 4.3. The predominant approach to dealing with model inconsistencies has been to ignore them, since they appear to be quite rare [2, 31].

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the resulting motion is ambiguous. However, we warn the reader that nonuniqueness in the contact force distribution does not necessarily imply nonuniqueness in the system motion. For example, the acceleration of frictionless systems are unique even when the contact force distribution is not <ref> [14] </ref>). Rajan, Burridge, and Schwartz studied and classified the indeterminate dynamic planar motion of a single rigid body in contact with two fixed rigid "walls" [31] (Note that in this paper, the "walls" can move and there can be any number of them).

Reference-contexts: In this section, we derive conditions necessary to meet these utility conditions. However, we recognize that the second condition, namely, that the contact forces and joint efforts can be uniquely determined, is overly restrictive in some situations (e.g., Lynch's stable pushing work <ref> [15] </ref>). Therefore, at the end of this subsection, we will indicate how to relax this condition. Consider first the velocity kinematic relationships corresponding to a given contact mode (equation (13)).

The problem he studied was to push a part (called a "slider") on a horizontal plane in such a way as to maintain sticking contact with the pusher at two points.

Reference-contexts: Examples of unstable system productively analyzed through a quasistatic model are Mason's and Peshkin's early work on planar pushing with one contact <ref> [18, 27] </ref>. We classify such pushing actions as unstable, because as the slider is pushed, it does not maintain its relative position with respect to the pusher. Nonetheless, such problems can benefit from quasistatic analysis, because friction effects dominate inertial forces.

Reference-contexts: These conditions are analogous to the form closure 2 conditions derived by Nguyen <ref> [22] </ref> for static planar grasps. However, because the three contacts are sliding, there are only have three constraining unisense wrenches. Therefore, form closure is impossible.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, a quasistatic, planar, multi-rigid-body model allowing sliding and rolling at multiple frictional contacts is explored. Since the coefficients of friction in real systems are sensitive to load and difficult to control factors, such as dirt and moisture in the contact interfaces <ref> [23] </ref>, the quasistatic model is studied with particular attention paid to gross variations in its solutions as a function of the coefficients of friction at the contacts. The friction model can be viewed as Coulomb's Law with friction coefficients varying in space and time.

Reference-contexts: The dynamic problem becomes a nonlinear complementarity problem [25], while the quasistatic problem takes the form of an uncoupled nonlinear complementarity problem (achieving this form requires a straight forward extension of the formulation given in <ref> [26] </ref>). 2.2 Model Indeterminacy and Inconsistency The dynamic and quasistatic models discussed above both suffer from indeterminacy in motion prediction, i.e., they can admit several contact modes for a given state and input even when all physical and geometric parameters are known precisely. Parameter uncertainty exaggerates this problem. <p> In planning applications, the amount of time to examine one system configuration should be considerably smaller than this. Therefore, we are currently developing a new algorithm based on the bilinear programming algorithm presented in <ref> [26] </ref>. With this algorithm, we found one solution to each of several test problems with n c = 3 + jt I j = 20 in several cpu seconds.

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, the quasistatic result was important, because it defined the boundary between applied wrenches that would cause acceleration into the hole and those that would cause jamming. An example of a dynamically stable system gainfully analyzed through a quasistatic model is Peshkin's fence layout planning for conveyor-belt parts-orienting systems <ref> [28] </ref>. In this sort of system, a part will typically develop two sliding or one rolling contact with a fence. Thus it is only possible to balance a two-dimensional subset of the three-dimensional space of wrenches that could be applied to the part by the conveyor belt.

Reference-contexts: The resulting region is shown in Figure 13. These bounds were used to generate a torque control trajectory for a prototype system with teflon coated surfaces.

Reference-contexts: However, because the three contacts are sliding, there are only have three constraining unisense wrenches. Therefore, form closure is impossible. Instead, the contacts are maintained by the action of the external wrench; the situation referred to as "force closure" by Reuleaux <ref> [33] </ref> and Salisbury [35]. and embodied in inequalities (35) and (36). It requires knowledge of the lines of action and the directions of the contact forces, which are known assuming that the joint velocity vector, _ , the coefficients of friction 3 , and the contact geometry are known.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the dynamic model is sensitive to the magnitudes of the velocity variables. In an approximate cell-decomposition approach the space of velocity variables must be discretized. While this discretization does not necessarily have to be fine <ref> [34] </ref>, some discretization that captures the system's sensitivity to velocity must be used. A second discretization of the velocity space is implied by the dependence of the contact 2 forces on relative velocities at the contacts. <p> Then, having generated a path based on a quasistatic model, an appropriate execution speed for the path can be determined by using a dynamic model and dynamic time-scaling techniques similar to those applied in [30] and <ref> [34] </ref>. In this paper, a quasistatic, planar, multi-rigid-body model allowing sliding and rolling at multiple frictional contacts is explored.

Reference-contexts: The vector c i is known as the wrench intensity vector <ref> [35] </ref> of the i th contact. The wrench matrix, W i , transforms the i th contact force into the world frame. <p> However, because the three contacts are sliding, there are only have three constraining unisense wrenches. Therefore, form closure is impossible. Instead, the contacts are maintained by the action of the external wrench; the situation referred to as "force closure" by Reuleaux [33] and Salisbury <ref> [35] </ref>. and embodied in inequalities (35) and (36). It requires knowledge of the lines of action and the directions of the contact forces, which are known assuming that the joint velocity vector, _ , the coefficients of friction 3 , and the contact geometry are known.

Reference-contexts: This results in a system of differential algebraic equations and inequalities in the contact forces and the accelerations of the bodies (for example, see <ref> [2, 13, 37] </ref>). Next one differentiates the nonpenetration constraints twice with respect to time to write them in terms of the system's unknown accelerations.

Reference-contexts: He found that for insertion to proceed quasistatically, the external force (applied by the manipulator to the peg) had to pass through the point of intersection of the contact forces applied by the hole <ref> [38] </ref>. Since control errors and uncertainty make the application of such a force impossible, Simunovic up-graded his model to a dynamic one to determine his main result; a recipe for choosing the direction and line of action of the applied force to guarantee acceleration into the hole.

Reference-contexts: The conjecture, which motivates our definition of model utility, is that as the applied wrench is varied within the set, the contact force distribution changes to maintain equilibrium. This sort of quasistatic behavior has been observed and exploited in several previous studies. In one study by Trinkle and Hunter <ref> [39] </ref>, a polygon was to be reoriented within a simple planar hand. In every configuration comprising the plan, the contact forces could balance a three-dimensional set of likely external wrenches, thereby making the plan robust to uncertainty in the position of the center of mass of the workpiece. <p> The fixed "palm" is connected to two single-link fingers whose revolute joints can be either position-or torque-controlled. In <ref> [39] </ref>, we discussed an automatic planner for this system, which found coordinated joint torque and position trajectories to manipulate the workpiece from the initial grasp to the goal grasp. <p> This plan, which was generated under the frictionless assumption, consisted of three compliant motion segments of type 4S, each of which could be executed by position-controlling one joint while torque-controlling the other. It was shown in <ref> [39] </ref> that the controlled torque merely needed to lie within loose bounds to guarantee successful manipulation.

Reference-contexts: In every configuration comprising the plan, the contact forces could balance a three-dimensional set of likely external wrenches, thereby making the plan robust to uncertainty in the position of the center of mass of the workpiece. No significant dynamic behavior was observed in experiments <ref> [40] </ref>. The same characteristics were present in earlier work done by Trinkle on how to lift a part off of a table top without causing excessive contact forces between the part and the table top [42]. Lynch's work on stable quasistatic pushing [16], provides a second example. <p> The resulting region is shown in Figure 13. These bounds were used to generate a torque control trajectory for a prototype system with teflon coated surfaces. The trajectory was successfully executed (see [32] <ref> [40] </ref> for details). It was observed that the 4S and R2S contact modes occurred as predicted.

Reference-contexts: The abovementioned fundamental difference between the quasistatic and dynamic multi-rigid-body models manifests itself in the problem formulations and applicable solution techniques. For example, the three-dimensional, frictionless, quasistatic problem may be formulated as a linear program <ref> [41] </ref>, while the analogous dynamic problem cannot. It can be formulated as a positive definite linear complementarity problem or equivalent positive definite quadratic program [2]. In the frictional case with sliding and rolling contacts, both problems become significantly more difficult to solve.

The problem he studied was to push a part (called a "slider") on a horizontal plane in such a way as to maintain sticking contact with the pusher at two points.

Reference-contexts: If, on the other hand, the bodies are assumed to be compliant, then the motion of the system and the contact forces can always be uniquely predicted <ref> [11, 43] </ref>. This feature is desirable when it comes to simulation and planning. However, predictions rely on estimates of the effective compliance and friction coefficients at each contact.

Examples of unstable system productively analyzed through a quasistatic model are Mason's and Peshkin's early work on planar pushing with one contact [18, 27]. We classify such pushing actions as unstable, because as the slider is pushed, it does not maintain its relative position with respect to the pusher.

Reference-contexts: In addition, equilibrium is possible when the input velocities, J i _ , are set to zero. Inequalities (35) and (36) embody the feasibility of the equilibrium and Coulomb constraints given the presumed contact mode. As pointed out by Zeng <ref> [45] </ref>, they also have a simple graphical interpretation which we paraphrase as follows: Corollary 1 Assume that there are n c contacts, n c 3. Consider a set of three contacts and assume that the kinematic velocity constraints implied by the sliding of those three contacts are satisfied.
