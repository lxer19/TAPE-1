Abstract: We present an approach for identifying the occluding contour and determining its sidedness using an active (i.e., moving) observer. It is based on the non-stationarity property of the visible rim: When the observer's viewpoint is changed, the visible rim is a collection of curves that slide, rigidly or non-rigidly, over the surface. We show that the observer can deterministically choose three views on the tangent plane of selected surface points to distinguish such curves from stationary surface curves (i.e., surface markings). Our approach demonstrates that the occluding contour can be identified directly, i.e., without first computing surface shape (distance and curvature).

Our goal is to exploit the non-stationarity of the visible rim to identify the occluding contour. This operation requires a correspondence between points on the surface at different viewpoints, and between points in images. We use the epipolar plane correspondences <ref> [3, 5, 6] </ref> for this purpose. In particular, suppose the observer's viewing direction changes according to ~(t) on a motion plane with normal n E . This motion defines a family of planes parallel to the observer's motion plane called the epipolar planes. <p> To improve tracking performance and reduce errors in the computation of kq ~qk we are also implementing a system for tracking curves rather than points. 8 Concluding Remarks We are currently studying how this strategy can be used to derive more robust estimates of surface curvature. Cipolla and Blake <ref> [3] </ref> have shown that curvature estimates based on rate of parallax measurements are insensitive to observer acceleration and rotational velocity. In general, these estimates require surface markings to be identified in the vicinity of the occluding contour.

This set depends on the shape of the surface and the observer's viewpoint and is a rich source of both quantitative and qualitative surface information <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. <p> The occluding contour is the projection of the visible rim on the image plane. The occluding contour and the visible rim each consist of a collection of open and closed smooth curves for almost all viewpoints of the observer <ref> [4] </ref>. The shape and position of the visible rim depends on the shape of S and the observer's viewpoint. This is the fundamental difference between visible rim curves and surface markings; the surface position of the curves corresponding to such markings is independent of the observer's viewpoint.

Reference-contexts: diamonds correspond to the points defining the three affine basis vectors. in general, persist for large viewing direction changes; however, if at least four tangency points are visible during the observer's motion (not necessarily the same ones throughout), one can use an approach similar to that of Tomasi and Kanade <ref> [19] </ref> to handle occlusions. To improve tracking performance and reduce errors in the computation of kq ~qk we are also implementing a system for tracking curves rather than points. 8 Concluding Remarks We are currently studying how this strategy can be used to derive more robust estimates of surface curvature.
