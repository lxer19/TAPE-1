Abstract: We present experimental results of applying the strategy to designing heuristics for the problem of constructing a maximum independent set of a given graph. The heuristic designed by database learning is compared with the best general-purpose heuristic for the problem.

Reference-contexts: Additional experiments with RB were conducted in order to test the rate of learning of the method on class G (n; 0:5). The results are presented in plots. All experiments were performed on a Sun Ultra 2, Model 2200. 5.1 Selecting the target. It is known ([4], <ref> [5] </ref>, [8]) that the expected size of the maximum independent set in G (n; 0:5) is 2 log 2 n. Thus, the size of the maximal independent set increases by one when the number of vertices increases roughly by a factor of p 2.
