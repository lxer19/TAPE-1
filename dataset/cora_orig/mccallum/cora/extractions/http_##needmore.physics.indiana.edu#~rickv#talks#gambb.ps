Abstract: The fraction of bb events in hadronic Z 0 decays has been measured from the yield of leptons in the data samples collected by OPAL in 1990 and 1991. A sample enriched in events containing Z 0 ! bb decays was obtained by requiring the presence of an electron or muon with high momentum and high momentum component transverse to the associated hadronic jet. After accounting for backgrounds and acceptances, a value of

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The partial decay widths of the Z 0 via the different quark and lepton channels are predicted in the Standard Model. The leptonic partial widths and the total hadronic width have been measured with about 1% precision at LEP <ref> [1] </ref> and are in good agreement with prediction. The decay widths to quarks, on the other hand, are measured with much larger errors. For b quarks, the partial decay width, (Z 0 ! bb), has been measured with typically 10% precision [2-8]. <p> The measurement is completely limited by systematic errors. This result supersedes previous published OPAL measurements of b b . Together with the OPAL measurement of the hadronic width of the Z 0 , had = 1738 12 MeV <ref> [1] </ref>, this result gives a value of b b = 382 22 MeV: The result is in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction for b b = had . The ZFITTER program [22], with the latest OPAL Z 0 lineshape parameters [1], predicts b b = had = 0:217 for <p> Z 0 , had = 1738 12 MeV <ref> [1] </ref>, this result gives a value of b b = 382 22 MeV: The result is in good agreement with the Standard Model prediction for b b = had . The ZFITTER program [22], with the latest OPAL Z 0 lineshape parameters [1], predicts b b = had = 0:217 for a top quark mass of 150 GeV/c 2 , a Higgs boson mass of 300 GeV/c 2 , and ff s = 0:12.

Reference-contexts: These difficulties can be avoided using double tagging techniques [7], but such measurements are statistically limited at present. This analysis used the data collected by the OPAL experiment in 1990 and 1991, considering both electrons and muons. It supersedes the previously published measurements <ref> [2, 3] </ref> based on 1990 OPAL data. Various improvements in understanding the data have been made, and the treatment of systematic uncertainties improved. <p> The transverse momentum, p t , of a lepton candidate was determined relative to the axis of the jet containing it. 5 Electron Identification and Backgrounds Selection Requirements The electron identification requirements closely followed those used in a previous publication <ref> [2] </ref>. Charged tracks reconstructed in the central detector were considered as electron candidates in the kinematic and geometrical region defined by * p &gt; 2 GeV/c, p t &gt; 0:8 GeV/c and jcos j &lt; 0:7, where p is the reconstructed lepton momentum. <p> Tracks passing these cuts were extrapolated to the lead-glass calorimeter after demanding that at least three hits in the z-chambers were associated to the track to improve the track pointing resolution in . This and the remaining electron identification criteria have been motivated in detail elsewhere <ref> [2] </ref>. The electromagnetic energy included in the cluster associated to the track and contained in the lead-glass blocks with centres lying within a 30 mrad cone around the extrapolated track was found. This energy, E cone , was required to satisfy * 0:7 &lt; E cone =p &lt; 1:4. <p> It was then demanded that * N 3 The sum E cone + E was denoted E cone2 in the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref>. 7 where N dE=dx is a normalized dE/dx value defined as N [dE/dx (dE/dx) 0 ] ; (dE/dx) 0 being the average dE/dx for electrons, about 10 keV/cm, and (dE/dx) an estimate of the resolution on dE/dx for the candidate track assuming that the track is an electron. <p> This procedure differs from that adopted in the previous publication <ref> [2] </ref> where the CLEO measurements of the b ! ` and b ! c ! ` branching ratios were used. Use of branching ratio measurements made in (4S) decays in this analysis leads to additional uncertainties due to the admixture of B s and fl b particles at LEP.

Reference-contexts: This results in a reduced dependence of the Z 0 ! bb decay width on the top quark mass. Precise measurements of this decay width would therefore be a way to test the Standard Model with less sensitivity to the uncertainty on the top mass <ref> [9] </ref>. Leptons with high momentum and large momentum component transverse to jets are a well established signature for b quarks. A large fraction of such leptons are expected to come from semileptonic decays of b hadrons, because of the relatively large mass and hard fragmentation of the b quark.

Reference-contexts: The most precise measurements of the branching ratios B have been made at lower energy experiments in (4S) decays. The results <ref> [10] </ref> from the CLEO Collaboration were taken, because the uncertainties in the momentum spectrum were explicitly considered. Section 7 explains how these results are treated for this analysis. 3 The OPAL Detector The OPAL detector has been described elsewhere [11], and only the components important for this analysis are reviewed. <p> The effects of different lepton spectra are important not only at LEP, but also in experiments at lower energies which make measurements of the semileptonic branching ratios. For this analysis the b ! ` and b ! c ! ` branching ratios measured by the CLEO Collaboration <ref> [10] </ref> were taken because they repeated their analysis with different decay spectra and quote the separate results explicitly. The measurements were made using decays of the (4S), which produce only B 0 and B + mesons. <p> The effect of uncertainties in the momentum spectrum of leptons from semileptonic c decays was also included. The spectra predicted by the ACCMM (with p F = 282 MeV/c, m s = 50 MeV/c 2 , from a fit <ref> [10] </ref> to DELCO data [26]) and ISGW models were considered. <p> Cascade decays b ! c ! ` require a more involved treatment, because reliable models do not exist for the inclusive b ! c decay. The b ! c ! ` spectra were derived <ref> [10] </ref> using a CLEO measurement of the momentum spectrum of D mesons reconstructed in B decays [27], folded with the ACCMM or ISGW predictions for the momentum spectrum of the lepton in the decaying c hadron rest frame. <p> For B (B 0 ,B + ! `) measured with electrons, the CLEO central result with the ACCMM model is (10.50.20.3)% <ref> [10] </ref>, an overall 3.4% relative error. While first measurements of the yields of semileptonically decaying B s and fl b hadrons have been made recently [29], their precision is not sufficient to be useful for this analysis without further constraints. <p> The CLEO measurement of the branching ratio product for B (b ! c ! e) with the ACCMM decay model is (9.70.80.6)% <ref> [10] </ref>, namely a 10.3% fractional error.

Reference-contexts: In addition, a silicon microvertex detector was installed inside the vertex detector for the 1991 data-taking period. The jet chamber, approximately 4 m long and 3.7 m in diameter, provides up to 159 space points per track, and measures the ionization energy loss of charged particles <ref> [12] </ref>. It is subdivided azimuthally into 24 sectors. The central tracking chambers are maintained at a gas pressure of four atmospheres in a pressure vessel, surrounded by a solenoidal coil providing a magnetic field of 0.435 T which is uniform within the volume of the central tracking chambers.

Reference-contexts: Hadronic Z 0 events were selected using an algorithm described elsewhere <ref> [13] </ref>, additionally requiring that there be at least seven charged tracks in each event. <p> The same criteria were applied to data and simulated two-photon events, and the modelling of the efficiency of identifying the other track as a muon was evaluated. Decays of the type Z 0 ! + were identified using a standard selection procedure described elsewhere <ref> [13] </ref>. This algorithm has an efficiency very close to 100% with very low backgrounds, resulting in negligible selection biases, so that both muons could be used to test the accuracy of the muon identification modelling.

Three main Monte Carlo samples were used for evaluating acceptances and backgrounds.

Simulated events were processed through the same reconstruction and selection algorithms as data from the detector. <p> The hadronization properties of all quark flavours were described by the Lund fragmentation function <ref> [14] </ref>. For b and c quarks a correction was evaluated to account for the different acceptances for the Lund and Peterson fragmentation functions. The same Monte Carlo samples were also used for determining changes in acceptances for different fragmentation and decay modelling parameters using a reweighting technique.

Compared to the DELCO data, the rest-frame momentum spectrum for c ! ` decays predicted by JETSET was found to be too soft, largely due to an excessive fraction of 4- and 5-body semileptonic D decays in the JETSET decay tables.

Reference-contexts: The measured product branching fractions for B s and fl b production and decay already made at LEP [29] can reduce this uncertainty slightly. Combining the measured numbers from OPAL and ALEPH, using B (fl c ! pK + )=(3.20.7)% and B (D s ! )=(2.80.5)% <ref> [31] </ref>, the branching ratio products f (b ! B s )B (B s ! D s `-X) = (1:6 0:5)% are obtained, where f (b ! B s ; fl b ) represents the probability that a b quark hadronizes into a hadron B s or fl b . <p> The ACCMM model is used to obtain the central result. The b ! J= ! ` Branching Ratio Combining the measured branching ratios for B 0 ; B + ! J= and J= ! ` + ` decays <ref> [31] </ref> gives for ` + ` and inclusively for leptons `: B (B 0 ; B + ! J= ! ` + ` ) = (0:07 0:01)% The unknown effect of B s and fl b decays is included by adding an additional 25% uncertainty to this branching ratio. <p> More sophisticated form-factor calculations [33] do not change this conclusion. Using the well-measured B (t ! e) = (17:9 0:3)% <ref> [31] </ref> gives B (b ! t ! `) = (0:5 0:2)%, where differences between measurements of B (b ! `) for different decay models have been neglected. These numbers are consistent with a recent measurement of the branching ratio for b ! t -t X by the ALEPH collaboration [34]. <p> The c ! ` Branching Ratio For semileptonic decays of c hadrons, the overall branching ratio is calculated considering the measured branching ratios and lifetimes of the separate hadron types. The semileptonic branching ratios and lifetimes of D 0 and D + mesons are well measured <ref> [31] </ref>, and the lifetimes of D s and fl c states are also known with better than 10% precision. If the semileptonic partial widths of all these c hadrons are assumed to be the same, the semileptonic branching ratios are just proportional to the particle lifetimes.

Reference-contexts: The b ! t ! ` Branching Ratio The branching ratio of b to t relative to b to e is predicted by the quark model <ref> [32] </ref> from phase space arguments. Allowing b and c quark masses to vary in the ranges 4.8-5.2 GeV/c 2 and 1.3-1.7 GeV/c 2 , respectively, gives a prediction for the relative t and e branching ratios of (2510)%. More sophisticated form-factor calculations [33] do not change this conclusion.

Using the well-measured B (t ! e) = (17:9 0:3)% [31] gives B (b ! t ! `) = (0:5 0:2)%, where differences between measurements of B (b ! `) for different decay models have been neglected.
