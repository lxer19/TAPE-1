Abstract: Over the past several years, there has been increasing interest in algorithms which automatically generate surface approximations. Such algorithms are especially useful in the field of computer graphics, where rendering time is a critical resource, and minimizing model complexity is essential. We present an efficient, robust algorithm for simplifying large models while maintaining a global bound on the approximation error introduced. This method makes use of two offset surfaces which surround the original surface, and within which we must perform our simplification. The algorithm takes as input a triangulated surface mesh, M , and a distance tolerance, *. It produces as output a new surface mesh ^ M which approximates M to within distance *. In addition, ^ M is a non-self-intersecting surface which shares the same topology as M . We show that this algorithm is efficient and robust enough to work with large models (at least tens of thousands of triangles). The simplification problem has been addressed recently in both the computer graphics literature and the computational geometry literature. Many of the earlier algorithms in the computer graphics literature provided no global bounds on the approximation error of the new mesh [Tur92, SZL92, RB93, HDD + 93]. A more recent wavelet approach can provide global error bounds, but the multi-resolution mesh generated by this approach is not fine-tuned for any any particular * bound. Also, the subdivision relationship between levels of detail limits the range of possible triangle shapes. Most of the work in the computational geometry literature has focused on the simplification of height fields and convex polytopes[Cla93, MS92, AS94]. In [AS94] Agarwal and Suri prove that the problem of finding optimal solutions, even for height fields, is NP-Hard. tween points on the original model and points on the simplified model [Var94]. This approach takes a greedy strategy over all possible mesh triangles to come within a factor ff(1+ln d) of the optimal. This approach is theoretically elegant, easy to automate for large numbers of objects (since it requires only one user-specifiable tolerance parameter that is easy to compute), and works well for small- to moderate-sized models. However, its complexity rises at least quadratically, making it prohibitive for large models. Our goal has been to extend that approach to work on large models consisting of hundreds of thousands of triangles in a robust manner while retaining all of the advantages of the former work. Additionally, we have extended that work to deal with bordered meshes and meshes with holes. We have been able to achieve this through a careful rethinking of the entire process as outlined in [Var94]. The result of this effort has been a new algorithm that can work with global error bounds on large-scale models, is robust, can be easily automated to handle large numbers of objects, and can handle meshs with holes and borders. Preliminary results show that it performs better than the current state-of-the-art wavelets-based method. We have been able to achieve this as follows. First, we have adapted the primarily global technique in [Var94] to take a more local approach. This reduces the complexity to close to linear making our algorithm feasible for large-scale models consisting of hundreds of thousands of triangles. Second, we have been able to remove the partitioning requirement of the offset volume as presented in [Var94]. This has enabled us to design a much more efficient and robust implementation. Third, we have introduced the idea of border tubes to correctly handle meshes with holes and borders. Finally, we suggest how we can achieve even better results by perturbing the original vertices by less than the global error bound of *. Our first step is to robustly compute a pair of non-self-intersecting *-offset surfaces of the original surface, one to either side of the original. We approximate these offset surfaces by triangular meshes whose elements correspond to the triangles of the original mesh. We move the vertices one at a time along their normal
