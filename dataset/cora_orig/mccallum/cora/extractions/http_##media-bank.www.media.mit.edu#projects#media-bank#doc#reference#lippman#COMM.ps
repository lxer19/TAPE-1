Abstract: This paper presents a design for a Media Bank that is a generalization of a video server. The bank is a distributed, evolutionary storage environment for audiovisual material accessed both sequentially and interactively. The idea is that information contained within it evolves both through use and through the analytical contributions of users. Every client is also a contributor to the bank.
