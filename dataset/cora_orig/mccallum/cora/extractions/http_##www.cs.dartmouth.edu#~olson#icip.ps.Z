Abstract: We present a new technique for image contrast enhancement via multiscale gradient transformation. In contrast to histogram-based techniques which aim to change the global statistical distribution of pixel intensities, we improve image contrast by modifying the modulus of the gradient image at multiple scales. In computation, a multiscale gradient representation of the image is generated by a wavelet transform (WT). Linear or nonlinear transformation is applied to multiscale gradients. A contrast-enhanced image is obtained from the transformed multiscale gradients by the inverse wavelet transform. Experimental results demonstrate two advantages of the new method: its flexibility to selectively enhance features of different sizes and ability to control noise magnification.

Reference-contexts: In many cases, low contrast can be considered as a result of nonuniform distribution of pixel intensities over the dynamic range of the display device. This idea underlines histogram-based contrast enhancement techniques which attempt to modify the intensity distribution of the image <ref> [1] </ref>. Another view of contrast problems relates them to the gradient of the image. Experience suggests a high correlation between the contrast of a grayscale image and the gradient magnitude in the neighborhood where the contrast is measured. Low-contrast often indicates flat gradient magnitudes, and vice verse. <p> Without loss of generality, we consider the normalized gradient magnitude, u j (x; y) = 2 j f (x; y)=(d max d min ): Clearly, u j takes its values in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. To enhance contrast, we seek a transformation that maps u j to v j on [0; 1]: where k j is a constant and g j () a function, both dependent on scale 2 j . <p> Without loss of generality, we consider the normalized gradient magnitude, u j (x; y) = 2 j f (x; y)=(d max d min ): Clearly, u j takes its values in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. To enhance contrast, we seek a transformation that maps u j to v j on [0; 1]: where k j is a constant and g j () a function, both dependent on scale 2 j . The angles of the multiscale gradients 2 j f (x; y) are preserved. <p> Therefore, we take g j to be a monotonic function on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. We consider two types of transformations. 3.1. Linear Transformation When the normalized gradient magnitude u j t 1, the over all contrast of the image is low. An effective transformation is linear stretching of the multiscale gradients. <p> We observe that while g 0 j (1) &lt; 1 on the entire defined ranges of a and b, g 0 j (0) may be greater or less than 1, depending on b. The maximum of g 0 j (x) on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> occurs at b=a, which is always greater than 1. 3.3. Transformation of Multiscale Edges The condition @g j =@u j 6= 0 confines g j (x) to monotonic functions on [0; 1]. <p> The maximum of g 0 j (x) on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> occurs at b=a, which is always greater than 1. 3.3.

Additional conditions must be satisfied for this function to be an admissible wavelet <ref> [2] </ref>. Grossmann [3] showed in one dimension that a complex Gaussian derivative of the first order is a such wavelet associated with a continuous WT.

Reference-contexts: THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED IN PART BY AN ARPA GRANT AND A CONTRACT FROM THE NAVAL SURFACE WARFARE CENTER. Furthermore, because edges are associated with gradients of large magnitudes, a multiscale edge representation may be built on the multiscale gradient representation, leading to a more compact representation <ref> [4] </ref>. In this paper, we develop a contrast enhancement technique using multiscale gradient representation generated by a WT. In addition to the computational efficiency that the WT provides, there are two other advantages to work in this framework. First, gradients provide more spatial information than histograms. <p> Additional conditions must be satisfied for this function to be an admissible wavelet [2].

These latter wavelets approximate the first-order derivative of a Gaussian and make it extremely efficient for computing multiscale gradients with dyadic WTs. Following Mallat and Zhong [4], we define two oriented wavelets as the partial derivatives of a smoothing function (x; y): @ (x; y) and 2 (x; y) = @y Assume an image is a differentiable two dimensional function f (x; y) 2 L 2 (R 2 ). <p> An efficient algorithm for computing multiscale gradients from discrete data is given in <ref> [4] </ref>. As an important feature of discrete WTs, for a J -level transform, we get the discrete multiscale gradients along with the smoothed image S 2 J f (x; y) at the coarsest scale 2 J . <p> A multiscale edge representation of f may be built from the multiscale gradient representation. More specifically, we can define multiscale edges as local maxima of gradi ent magnitudes along the gradient angles at each scale. Clearly, they are a subset of multiscale gradients. Mal-lat and Zhong <ref> [4] </ref> has shown that this subset along with S 2 J f (x; y) form an almost complete representation of f . 3. CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT In Section 1, we introduced an intuitive idea of gradient-based contrast enhancement based on the notion of increasing the magnitude of the image gradient. <p> Since multiscale gradients can be effectively reconstructed from the multiscale edges <ref> [4] </ref>, direct manipulation on the magnitudes of multiscale edges provides ultimate flexibility. There is virtually no constraint on the transfer function g j (x); the positions of the multiscale edges will always be preserved unless we decide to delete some of them for noise reduction.

Reference-contexts: For the transfer functions defined by Eqs. (7) and (8), similar results can be obtained by applying them to either the multiscale gradients or the multiscale edges. Algorithms for contrast enhancement using multiscale edge representation are detailed in <ref> [5] </ref>. Finally, we note that for using discrete WT representations, we need to update S 2 J f (x; y) so that it will be consistent with the transformed multiscale gradients or edges.
