Reference-contexts: In general, this produces more aggregates and requires more computing time. These matters will be treated in <ref> [2] </ref>. In section 2, fine grain aggregations for queueing networks with blocking are presented, and in section 3, numerical results are presented which verify that accurate approximations can be obtained using fine grain aggregation.

Reference-contexts: We present an outline of our results analyzing the following queueing network models with repetitive-service blocking: 1. Open tandem networks, arrivals at the first node. Comparison with results according to Caseau and Pujolle <ref> [3] </ref>. Their technique relies on a heuristic: the sevice rates k ; k = 1; : : : ; K; are augmented in order to take into account repeated services which are due to blocking. 2. Open tandem networks. Comparison with results according to Labetoulle and Pujolle [10].

Reference-contexts: Comparison of DA iteration with coarse, fine, and very fine aggregation for open networks with tandem, split, merge, and symmetrical topology. 5. Closed, cyclic networks. Comparison with results obtained by the technique of Frein and Dallery <ref> [4] </ref>. Their decomposition method can analyze closed cyclic networks with blocking-before-service policy which is equivalent to the repetitive service policy in these networks. 6. Comparison of the computing times for vector iteration and DA iteration, applied to a symmetrical topology with a large number of states. 7.

Reference-contexts: First, it satisfies the macro probabilities, R = A (); and secondly, maximizes the entropy. Thus, according to the product form theorem, see Kagan, Linnik, Rao <ref> [7, theorem 13.2.1, page 409] </ref>, this maximum entropy distribution (MED) is uniquely determined and has a product form, (z) = G k=1 3 where the ae k;z k &gt; 0 are some real numbers, r k (j) = G z2Z T C Y ae i;z i ; j = 0; :

Reference-contexts: Here, the blocking policy is a bit different, a rejected job clings to the next node (repetitive-service with fixed destination). In a tandem network both blocking policies are equivalent. 3. Open networks with various topologies. Comparison with results according to Kou-vatsos, Xenios and Denazis <ref> [9, 8] </ref>. Their algorithm is quite general, suited for open and closed queueing networks with repetitive-service blocking. Interarrival times and service times have general exponential distributions. The state probabilities are obtained by maximizing the entropy observing some reasonable constraints. 4.

Reference-contexts: This can be generalized for the case where Z T consists of the union of cartesian products, <ref> [14, section 3] </ref>. Another simple case where the state space is not necessarily rectangular are the state probabilities in product form queueing networks. Instead of calculating the steady state probabilities q of a Markov chain we determine an approximation p = D (R) where R = T (R) holds. <p> According to our experience, such conditions are fulfilled very often in Markov chains originating from performance or reliability models. We have not yet found any model which could not be treated with DA iteration although we tried many different models. In <ref> [14, section 3] </ref>, conditions are given under which this is possible. <p> Otherwise let t := t + 1 and goto step 1) Results: The macro probabilities R (t+1) , the MED parameters ae (t+1) , and the normalizing constant G (t+1) . 2 In <ref> [14] </ref> the DA product form theorem is proven: The equation R = T (R) has a solution.

But in [14] is proven that there is always an aggregation with only a small number of aggregates for which an approximating product form (2) exists which is as accurate as desired.
