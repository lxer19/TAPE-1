Reference-contexts: Interval-based temporal ontology is by now well established; see, for example, <ref> [1] </ref>. We use I; J to range over temporal intervals. One could do without this type-extension by regarding temporal intervals as ordinary entities of type e (e for entity).

Reference-contexts: In particular, we shall demonstrate how the correct truth-conditions are assigned to sentences (6) and (7). Our strategy will be to take the meaning of a temporal noun phrase to be a temporal generalized quantifier (TGQ), a natural extension of the classical generalized quantifier introduced in Barwise and Cooper <ref> [3] </ref>. A major advantage of our semantics is the elegant account for cascaded TPP modifications in sentences like (8) Mary kissed John during every meeting one day in January. We claim that these cascades are not handled correctly by existing approaches.

Reference-contexts: Most research to date on the formal semantics of temporal expressions in natural languages has focused on tense and aspect, 1 with relatively little research devoted to TPs. The locus classicus on the semantics of TPs is still Dowty <ref> [7] </ref>, though several partial accounts are often to be found in semantic theories whose main focus lies elsewhere. 2 The present account is motivated by two well-known observations, which, we claim, the literature to-date fails to treat adequately. <p> If is a phrase of syntactic category C, we use the notation [[ C ]] to denote its meaning. 5 This expedient was also proposed by Dowty <ref> [7] </ref>, p. 326. 3 3 The semantics of temporally-unmodified sentences This section sets the scene for the main contribution of the paper in section 4. <p> As we have seen, the TPPs must form a cascade, with the quantification in each TPP restricted to the intervals set up by the previous TPP. In this respect, we claim, our account is an improvement on that of Dowty <ref> [7] </ref>, pp. 328 ff. Although Dowty only sketches an account of how his proposed semantics might be extended to deal with multiple TPPs, it is clear that he requires the time within which the reported event is constrained to occur to satisfy a conjunction of conditions|one imposed by each TPP. <p> By constrast, (134) * John telephoned Mary every day in five weeks is blocked by our proposed modificand restrictions on in. (Analogous restrictions on combining in-adverbials with state-reporting verbs are slightly more complex, and are explained in section 5.) We note in passing that, unlike Dowty's account in <ref> [7] </ref>, pp. 332 ff., where for- and in-adverbials are taken to be of a different type to locative adverbials, our account gives a uniform treatment. Finally, we come to until. <p> given what has already been said, we have the meanings: (242) [[ ^ S John read while Mary slept]] 1 = [[ TPP while Mary slept]]( 2 [[ ^ S John read]] 1 ) 2 = 29 Thus, we take the modification to the semantics of in proposed by Dowty <ref> [7] </ref>, p. 335, for dealing with this problem, to be unnecessary. 30 An alternative account is possible, where a state is modelled by predicates taken to be true only at maximal intervals throughout which it holds, and the temporal quantification in the subordinate is taken to be the, not a.

Reference-contexts: We consider first TPPs with simple noun-phrase complements, passing to complements of other categories, and complements which are themselves modified by TPPs. The meaning derivations introduce some operations in the -calculus which are different to ordinary function application. In a companion paper <ref> [8] </ref>, we show how to derive the meaning of sentences containing TPPs using logical deduction within a glue-language, in the spirit of the syntax-semantics 3 Arguably, other complements are possible as well as in, e.g.

Reference-contexts: A lucid presentation of the formalism can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>. In the present paper, we use small capital font for the IL relations and constants corresponding to the obvious English words. For example, student (x) denotes the property picked out by the common noun student, and john denotes the person named by John.

Reference-contexts: For instance, in (166) When John arrived at the airport, he went to the check-in desk (167) ? When John drank his beer, he left the pub, the odd nature of (167) stems from the fact that the just-after reading is, for some reason, unavailable (see <ref> [10] </ref> for a discussion). However, these issues are orthogonal to the framework developed here. The temporal preposition whenever can also function like when, except that there is universal (rather than definite) quantification over events picked out by the complement sentence: (168) John telephoned Mary whenever Jane went to the station.

Reference-contexts: Mary telephoned John one Monday. However, the precise rules governing the use of covert TPPs are complex and dialect-dependent (varying, for instance, between US and British English), and probably cannot be entirely semantically motivated. 11 See Herskovits <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we are using state in a non-standard way. 7 The strategy of treating events and states differently in roughly this respect was argued for by Herweg in <ref> [12] </ref>. We identify time points with intervals of the form [t; t]. Whether a sentence is state-reporting or event-reporting depends on not only on the main verb, but also on the subject and verb-complements (see, for example, Krifka [18], Verkuyl [27], White [28]).

Reference-contexts: having a covert quantifier the, i.e., (86) [[ TPP in January]] = P I [the (J [January (J )^J I]; P )] and pseudo-applying it to the S-meaning (85), we obtain, after determination, the correct meaning (81). 9 For a discussion of the effect of PP-attachment on truth-conditions, see Hitzemann <ref> [15] </ref>. 13 In dealing with sentences (75)-(77), we pseudo-applied the TPP-meanings to an S-meaning, and only then applied determination to yield the final ^ S-meaning. But this policy fails for sentences with universal quantification within a TPP, such as (87) Mary kissed John every day.
