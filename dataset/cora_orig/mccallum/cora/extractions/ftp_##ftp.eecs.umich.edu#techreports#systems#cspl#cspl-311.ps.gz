Abstract: In this paper, turbo codes are investigated in a slow frequency-hopped spread spectrum (FH-SS) system with partial-band jamming. In addition, full-band thermal noise is present. The channel model is that of a partial-band jammer in which a fraction of the frequency band is jammed and the remaining fraction is unjammed. This paper focuses on the implemention and performance of a modified turbo decoder for this model. We refer to the knowledge that each transmitted bit is jammed as channel state information. We consider cases of known or unknown channel state and variable number of bits per hop. Our approach is to modify the calculation of branch transition probabilities inherent in the original turbo decoder. For the cases with no side information and multiple bits per hop, we iteratively calculate channel state estimates. Analytical bounds are derived and simulation is performed for noncoherent demodulation. The performance of turbo codes is compared with a Reed-Solomon and a concatenated code comprised of a convolutional inner code and Reed-Solomon outer code.

Reference-contexts: Turbo codes were considered for a coherent frequency-hop spread spectrum system with partial band interference in <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper, we investigate the performance of turbo codes in a noncoherent frequency-hop spread spectrum system with partial-band interference. The outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, the system model including details of the FH-SS model is described and turbo codes are briefly reviewed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Turbo codes are an exciting new channel coding scheme that achieve data communication at signal-to-noise ratios close to the Shannon limit. The results published in the inaugural paper by Berrou et al <ref> [3] </ref> were so good that they were met with much skepticism by the coding community. Since then, however, these results have been reproduced and even improved. Consequently, much of the present research is focused on applying turbo codes to different systems. <p> Finally, we discuss the potential of applying turbo codes to practical FH-SS systems in our conclusion of Section 7. 2 System Model 2.1 Transmitter As stated before, the turbo encoder is formed using two constituent codes. As in the original work by Berrou et al <ref> [3] </ref>, the constituent codes considered in this paper are recursive systematic convolutional codes. The turbo encoder is formed by concatenating the constituent codes in parallel and then separating the codes by an interleaver. A block diagram of the encoder is shown in Figure 1.

Because square-law combining is suboptimal, an upper bound on its performance will also be an upper bound to the performance of optimal decoding.

Reference-contexts: In this manner, joint decoding and phase tracking can be achieved. In order to gauge our results, we refer to the application of other coding methods to FH-SS systems. In particular, Pursley and Frank investigated the use of the Reed-Solomon code and the Reed-Solomon/convolutional concatenated code (RS-CC) in <ref> [6] </ref>. For the Reed-Solomon code with no inner code, they used a (32; 12) errors-only RS code with noncoherent reception and 27 codewords per packet. Thus, the code had rate 3=8 and the total number of information bits per packet was 1620. There were 135 binary symbols per dwell period.

Reference-contexts: Each MAP decoder has the approximate complexity of the Viterbi algorithm and this must be iterated several times. It is known that turbo code performance generally increases with interleaver or block length <ref> [8] </ref>. In fact, Berrou et al showed a bit error rate of 10 5 at 0:7 dB, but needed to use 18 decoding iterations and a block length of 65; 536 bits.

In packet data communications, the use of error correction codes plays a key role in achieving low packet error rates.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, at each point in time, the state of each component encoder is generally different due to the existence of the interleaver. To solve this problem, a helical interleaver <ref> [13] </ref> is considered. In short, a helical interleaver forces both encoders to end in the same state, thus allowing a sequence of M bits to terminate both trellises. The modulation considered is binary frequency shift keying (BFSK). The resultant signal is frequency hopped.
