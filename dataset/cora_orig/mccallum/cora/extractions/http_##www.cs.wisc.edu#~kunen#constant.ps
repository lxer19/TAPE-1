Abstract: Let X be a compact Hausdorff space and M a metric space. E 0 (X; M ) is the set of f 2 C(X; M ) such that there is a dense set of points x 2 X with f constant on some neighborhood of x. We describe some general classes of X for which E 0 (X; M ) is all of C(X; M ). These include fiNnN, any nowhere separable LOTS, and any X such that forcing with the open subsets of X does not add reals. In the case that M is a Banach space, we discuss the properties of E 0 (X; M ) as a normed linear space. We also build three first countable Eberlein compact spaces, F; G; H, with various E 0 properties. For all metric M , E 0 (F; M ) contains only the constant functions, and E 0 (G; M ) = C(G; M ). If M is the Hilbert cube or any infinite dimensional Banach space, E 0 (H; M ) 6= C(H; M ), but E 0 (H; M ) = C(H; M ) whenever M R n for some finite n. x0. Introduction. If X is a compact Hausdorff space and M is a metric space, let C(X; M ) be the space of all continuous functions from X into M . C(X; M ) is a metric space under the sup norm. C(X) denotes C(X; R), which is a (real) Banach algebra. Following [5, 6, 7, 13, 14], if f 2 C(X; M ), let f be the union of all open U X such that f is constant on U . Then, E 0 (X; M ) is the set of all f 2 C(X; M ) such that f is dense in X; these functions are called "locally constant on a dense set". E 0 (X) denotes E 0 (X; R). Clearly, E 0 (X) is a subalgebra of C(X) and contains all the constant functions. As Bernard and Sidney point out [6, 7, 14], if X is compact metric with no isolated points, then E 0 (X) is a proper dense subspace of C(X). In this paper, we study the two extreme situations: where E 0 (X) contains only the constant functions, and where E 0 (X) = C(X). In x5, we give some justification for studying these two extremes. A standard example of elementary analysis is a monotonic f 2 C([0; 1]) which does all its growing on a Cantor set; then f is a nonconstant function in E 0 ([0; 1]). More generally, for "many" X, E 0 (X) separates points in X, and hence (by the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem), is dense in C(X). Specifically,

Reference-contexts: We comment further on their work at the end of x3. x1. Cantor Sets. By a closed interval we mean any compact space homeomorphic to <ref> [0; 1] </ref> R. By a Cantor set we mean any space homeomorphic to the usual Cantor set in R; equivalently, homeomorphic to 2 ! , where 2 = f0; 1g has the discrete topology. The following lemma was used also in [13]. 1.1. Lemma. <p> If we deleted (3), then 1.2 would be immediate from 1.1, using the Axiom of Choice, without any assumption on X. But (3) says that we can choose the Cantor sets continuously. As stated, the Theorem requires X to be zero-dimensional. For example, suppose X = J = <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and we take f to be constant on the strip f (x; y) : jx yj &lt; 1 3 g. Then H must be disjoint from the strip, which is easily seen to contradict (3). Of course, (1) follows from (3). <p> However, if one does not care about disjointness, there is no advantage to using a disk, so [13] used an interval where we used D. The extra dimension in D lets us prove Lemma 2.2, which is easily seen to be false of <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Actually, when the K ff are disjoint, condition (2) above is redundant, since it follows from (3), but if the K ff are not disjoint, (2) is required to guarantee that L 2 is norm bounded. By iterating our construction, we now prove the following theorem. 2.5. Theorem. <p> If M contains a closed interval, then (2) implies (1). Proof. For (1) ! (2), fix f 2 E 0 (X; M ). We may assume M = f (X), whence M is compact. For each g : M ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, g ffi f is in E 0 (X; R) and hence constant, which implies that f is constant. <p> For a counter-example, let M be a Cantor set and let X be the cone over M . Then E 0 (X; M ) = C (X; M ) contains only constant functions. But X contains a regular closed Y homeomorphic to M fi <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and E 0 (Y; M ) 6= C (Y; M ). <p> In general, for a LOTS, (1) need not imply (4). A simple counter-example is X = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! , ordered lexically; (4) is refuted by f (x) = P n2! x n 2 n . One can replace [0; 1] by the Cantor set here to get a zero-dimensional LOTS, providing also a counter-example to (c) extending to (2) , (4). <p> In general, for a LOTS, (1) need not imply (4).

One can replace [0; 1] by the Cantor set here to get a zero-dimensional LOTS, providing also a counter-example to (c) extending to (2) , (4). The Stone space of an atomless probability algebra is a compact e.d. space which satisfies (1) but not (3). <p> Let F 0 be the collection of all zero or one point spaces.

Define F = S ffi2ON F ffi , where ON is the class of ordinals. <p> Of course, we need to know that such an M exists, but that follows by a theorem of Levshenko. There is a class of strongly infinite dimensional spaces which includes the Hilbert cube, <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! . Levshenko showed that if M is a strongly infinite dimensional compact metric space and ' 2 C (M; [0; 1]), then some ' 1 frg is strongly infinite dimensional (see [1]). This gives us the following lemma. 4.3. Lemma. <p> There is a class of strongly infinite dimensional spaces which includes the Hilbert cube, <ref> [0; 1] </ref> ! . Levshenko showed that if M is a strongly infinite dimensional compact metric space and ' 2 C (M; [0; 1]), then some ' 1 frg is strongly infinite dimensional (see [1]).

Proof. <p> There is a class of strongly infinite dimensional spaces which includes the Hilbert cube, [0; 1] ! . Levshenko showed that if M is a strongly infinite dimensional compact metric space and ' 2 C (M; [0; 1]), then some ' 1 frg is strongly infinite dimensional (see <ref> [1] </ref>). This gives us the following lemma. 4.3. Lemma. If M 2 F , then M is not strongly infinite dimensional. Proof. <p> To prove f 2 E 0 (X; M ), we fix a nonempty open U X, and we produce a nonempty open V U such that f is constant on V . Applying the definition of F ff , fix ' 2 C (M; <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) such that for each r 2 [0; 1] ' 1 frg 2 S ffi&lt;ff F ffi . <p> Applying the definition of F ff , fix ' 2 C (M; <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) such that for each r 2 [0; 1] ' 1 frg 2 S ffi&lt;ff F ffi . Then ' ffi f 2 C (X; R) = E 0 (X; R), so fix a nonempty open set W U such that ' ffi f has some constant value r on W . <p> Lemma. Suppose that M is compact metric and M = H [ K, where H; K are closed subsets of M and H; K 2 F . Then M 2 F . Proof. Since H is a closed G ffi , fix ' 2 C (M; <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) such that ' 1 f0g = H. Then, ' 1 f0g 2 F . For r &gt; 0, we have ' 1 frg K, so ' 1 frg 2 F by Lemma 4.4. So, ' 1 frg 2 F for each r 2 [0; 1], which implies that M <p> fix ' 2 C (M; <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) such that ' 1 f0g = H. Then, ' 1 f0g 2 F . For r &gt; 0, we have ' 1 frg K, so ' 1 frg 2 F by Lemma 4.4. So, ' 1 frg 2 F for each r 2 [0; 1], which implies that M 2 F . ffiffi ^ fl Call M nowhere in F iff M is nonempty and for each nonempty open V M , we have V =2 F . <p> Note that B (p; *) and its closure are computed in M , not K. Let N = B (p; *). Fix ' 2 C (N; <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) such that ' 1 f0g = N " K. Since B (p; *) " K is nonempty, N =2 F , so there must be some r 2 [0; 1] such that ' 1 frg =2 F . <p> Let N = B (p; *). Fix ' 2 C (N; <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) such that ' 1 f0g = N " K. Since B (p; *) " K is nonempty, N =2 F , so there must be some r 2 [0; 1] such that ' 1 frg =2 F . However, for r &gt; 0, ' 1 frg is compact and disjoint from K, so it is covered by a finite subfamily of U , and hence, as above, is in F . <p> Let J ff = X ff +r ff ~ b+ ~m ff . Then J ff is homeomorphic to X ff (via translation). Let X be the union of the J ff , together with all r ~ b for r 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Then X is norm bounded (by p 3), and is weakly closed, since any limit of points in distinct J ff must be of the form r ~ b; the existence of these limits also shows that the union of the J ff is dense in X. <p> If lh (s) = n, let D s be the set of vectors of the form ~v + P in r i ~e si , where ~v 2 K () and each jr i j 2 i . In particular, D () is homeomorphic to K fi <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. As in x2, the product with [1; 1] allows us to make the K ff disjoint subsets of D () . As before, if i n, then i+1 (D s ) = D si . <p> In particular, D () is homeomorphic to K fi <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. As in x2, the product with [1; 1] allows us to make the K ff disjoint subsets of D () . As before, if i n, then i+1 (D s ) = D si . <p> If X = L 2 , then Y is obtained by collapsing L 1 to a point. In these two cases, E 0 = E 0 (Y; M ), but this is not in general true. For example, let Q be any dense subset of <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and form X by attaching a copy of the L ! of x2 to each q 2 Q, where each copy goes off in some perpendicular direction. There is then a natural retraction, r : X ! [0; 1], and E 0 (X; R) consists of all functions of <p> For example, let Q be any dense subset of <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and form X by attaching a copy of the L ! of x2 to each q 2 Q, where each copy goes off in some perpendicular direction. There is then a natural retraction, r : X ! [0; 1], and E 0 (X; R) consists of all functions of the form f ffi r, where 20 f 2 C ([0; 1]; R). So, we may identify Y with [0; 1] and with r, and E 0 is C (Y; R), not E 0 (Y; R). <p> There is then a natural retraction, r : X ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and E 0 (X; R) consists of all functions of the form f ffi r, where 20 f 2 C ([0; 1]; R). So, we may identify Y with [0; 1] and with r, and E 0 is C (Y; R), not E 0 (Y; R). Third, we remark on some consequences of assuming that E C (X; M ) has the refinement property. <p> To obtain this situation, we shall focus on the dyadic rationals. Let D n = fj 2 n : 0 j 2 n g; so, D 0 = f0; 1g and D 1 = f0; 1 2 ; 1g. Inductively choose f n 2 C (X; <ref> [0; 1] </ref>) so that: 1. x 2 int (f 1 0 f1g). 2. f n is n-supported. 3. kf n+1 f n k 2 n . 4. f 1 n+1 fqg whenever q 2 D n . 5. f n (int (f 1 Let f = lim n f n .

The proof of the next Lemma is very similar in spirit to that of Theorem 2 of <ref> [14] </ref>, but we include it because at first sight, the proof as stated in [14] might appear to require some additional assumptions about E and X. <p> The proof of the next Lemma is very similar in spirit to that of Theorem 2 of <ref> [14] </ref>, but we include it because at first sight, the proof as stated in [14] might appear to require some additional assumptions about E and X. The two examples above of subspaces of C ([0; 1]; R) show that neither of the two components of "nice", "refinement property" and "disjoint summation property", is sufficient here. 5.2. Lemma.

Reference-contexts: This provides a counter-example to replacing (2) by (1) in either (b) or (c). Conditions (4), (fl), and (5) are equivalent to algebraic conditions on the Boolean algebra of regular open subsets of X (see <ref> [9, 15] </ref>); in particular, each condition holds for X iff it holds for the absolute of X.
