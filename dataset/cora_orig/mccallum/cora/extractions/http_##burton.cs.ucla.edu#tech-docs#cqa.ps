Abstract: This chapter proposes the use of the type abstraction hierarchy (TAH) as a framework for deriving cooperative query answers (CQA). The TAH integrates abstraction with the subsumption (is-a) and composition (part-of) semantics found in the type hierarchy. This framework provides a multi-level object representation that is an important aspect of cooperative query answering. Patterns, which specify one or more conditions on an object, are introduced as a small granularity structure with specific semantic information. Cooperative query answering uses the TAH and patterns to provide query relaxation, generalization and specialization. Relaxation can be explicitly controlled by the user, implicitly performed by the system, or both. An explanation system is also included to present the relaxation path as well as a nearness measure between the approximate answer and the exact answer. The operations required for CQA may be added to any conventional query language. As an example, we present CSQL, a cooperative extension of SQL used in the CoBase project at UCLA. Experimental results reveal that the proposed type abstraction hierarchy and relaxation control provide an organized structure for representing concepts at different knowledge levels in various domains, and offers a systematic and efficient method for cooperative query answering.

Reference-contexts: CoBase uses LOOM [15, 16] as knowledge representation and inference system and supports relational data bases (e.g. Oracle and Sybase) and LIM (the Loom Interface Module) [17, 10]. Access to distributed databases is made possible through SIMS, a transparent multi-database access layer <ref> [1] </ref>. The CoBase engine, written in LISP, controls query relaxation and modification based on the user-provided relaxation constructs, the type abstraction hierarchy, and direction from the relaxation manager.

Reference-contexts: To show this we introduce the notions of pattern and pattern instance. A pattern is defined on a type by specifying a condition <ref> [3] </ref>. For example, given the following schema definition, AA flight (departure airport, arrival airport, departure time, arrival time, flight#) conditions such as departure airport = "LAX", or departure time = "9am" define patterns on the type AA flight.
