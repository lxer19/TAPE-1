Reference-contexts: Many of these researchers have turned to ethological studies as a source for behaviors that are relevant in certain circumstances. Specific models used in reactive robotic systems have been quite varied including bird flocking, ant foraging, fish schooling, and cockroach escape, among others. One example involving toad detour behavior <ref> (Arbib and House, 1987) </ref> provided motivation and justification for the use of vector fields in reactive schema-based robot navigation (Arkin, 1990a). * Co-existence of parallel planning and execution systems (hybrid systems) Norman and Shallice (Norman and Shallice, 1986) have modeled the co-existence of two distinct systems concerned with controlling human behavior.

Reference-contexts: One excellent example is presented in <ref> (Arbib, 1972) </ref>. His model of action-oriented perception shows that what an agent needs to perceive is based upon its needs to act. This is a primary guiding principle in the design of reactive robots.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the strong coupling between action and perception is one of the hallmarks of purely reactive robotic systems. Neisser has further developed these ideas in the context of cognitive psychology (see <ref> (Arkin, 1990a) </ref> for a review of those aspects relevant to robotic systems). * Ethological studies A pressing question for reactive robotic system designers is just what behaviors are necessary or sufficient for a particular task and environment. <p> Specific models used in reactive robotic systems have been quite varied including bird flocking, ant foraging, fish schooling, and cockroach escape, among others. One example involving toad detour behavior (Arbib and House, 1987) provided motivation and justification for the use of vector fields in reactive schema-based robot navigation <ref> (Arkin, 1990a) </ref>. * Co-existence of parallel planning and execution systems (hybrid systems) Norman and Shallice (Norman and Shallice, 1986) have modeled the co-existence of two distinct systems concerned with controlling human behavior. One system models "automatic" behavior and is closely aligned with reactive systems.
