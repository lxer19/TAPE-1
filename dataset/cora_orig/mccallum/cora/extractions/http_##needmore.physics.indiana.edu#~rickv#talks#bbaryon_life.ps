Abstract: The average lifetime of b-flavoured baryons measured with the OPAL detector is updated to include data collected between 1990 and 1994 at LEP. Bottom-flavoured baryons that decay semileptonically and produce a fl baryon are identified through the correlation of the baryon number of the fl and the electric charge of the lepton. To measure the lifetime, the decay point of the b baryon is estimated by the fl-lepton vertex, and the observed distribution of decay lengths is fitted simultaneously in 874 right-sign and 384 wrong-sign combinations. In a separate method, the impact parameter distribution of the leptons is fitted in a subset of these data. When the two results are combined, taking correlations into account, the average b-baryon lifetime is found to be f(b ! fl b ) BR(fl b ! fl` -X) = (2:91 0:23 (stat:) 0:25 (syst:)) 10 3 ; where the symbol f(b ! fl b ) is the fraction of b quarks from Z 0 decays forming b baryons, fl b represents all b-flavoured baryons and ` is either an electron or a muon.

Reference-contexts: Because of the large mass of the b quark, the influence of the spectator quarks is thought to be small in b-hadron decays. As a result, lifetimes of the different weakly decaying b-flavoured hadrons are expected to be equal to within 10-20% <ref> [1] </ref>. The greatest variation is predicted for b baryons, which are expected to have shorter lifetimes than the B mesons since the non-spectator W-exchange diagram is helicity suppressed in mesons but not in baryons. <p> The other charge combinations ( fl-` and fl-` + ) are used to characterize and estimate the level of background. Only the ground-state b baryons fl 0 b (quark content: bud), ffi 0 b (bsu), ffi b (bss) are expected to decay weakly <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It is important to verify this prediction in the context of calculations invoking heavy quark mass expansions in the framework of QCD. Non-spectator effects will also influence the semileptonic branching ratio of b baryons. This branching ratio is expected to be smaller for b baryons than for B mesons <ref> [2] </ref>. Unfortunately, the measurement of the semileptonic branching ratio at LEP is complicated by the unknown total b-baryon production rate in Z 0 decays. <p> A form factor to describe the energy transfer from the b baryon to the c baryon in the semileptonic decay of the b baryon also needs to be included. Additional samples, which include the effects of a b-baryon decay form factor <ref> [2] </ref> calculated to first order in the inverse of the b quark mass, were also generated. <p> decay length method and 0:04 ps for the impact parameter method are taken as systematic errors. 6.3 b-Baryon Decay Model The enriched Monte Carlo events used to find the function g (y) for the decay length method and the underlying physics distributions for the impact parameter method employed theoretical predictions <ref> [2] </ref> for a form factor to describe the energy transfer from the b baryon to the c baryon in the semileptonic decay of the b baryon. <p> As described in Section 6.3, the effect of the fl b decay modelling was studied by using Monte Carlo samples to simulate different form factors. Differences in efficiencies between the central value using the form factor of Ref. <ref> [2] </ref> and those obtained by using an alternative theoretical form factor [27], or no form factor at all, were used to estimate a systematic error due to this source. The maximum observed difference in efficiency of 4:5% is assigned as the systematic uncertainty. <p> Typical theoretical estimates of BR (fl b ! fl + c ` -X) range from 2.45% <ref> [2] </ref> to 10-13% [27] indicating the strong need for a measurement of this branching ratio to allow the reliable extraction of f (b ! fl b ) from the measured product branching ratio.

Only those lepton tracks that have at least one hit in the silicon microvertex detector were used since the error on the impact parameter measurement benefits from this added high-precision tracking information. After this requirement a data sample of 604 right-sign and 248 wrong-sign fl-lepton combinations remains. <p> 6 compares this result to other OPAL measurements [7] of lifetimes of exclusive B mesons, to an OPAL lifetime measurement obtained from a sample of fl c - lepton combinations that provides a purer sample of fl 0 b decays [6], and to the OPAL inclusive b hadron lifetime measurement <ref> [4] </ref>. The presented result is consistent with results from other experiments [8] and is also more precise. When OPAL's fl 0 b lifetime measurement [6] is combined with the presented result, an average lifetime of 1:16 0:11 ps is found, where the error is the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: The correlation of a fl with a negatively-charged lepton or a fl with a positively-charged lepton can indicate the presence of a semileptonic b-baryon decay, as used by OPAL in Ref. <ref> [9] </ref>. The other charge combinations ( fl-` and fl-` + ) are used to characterize and estimate the level of background. Only the ground-state b baryons fl 0 b (quark content: bud), ffi 0 b (bsu), ffi b (bss) are expected to decay weakly [1]. <p> In addition to updating the decay length measurement to include 1993 and 1994 data, the analysis presented here also includes a lifetime measurement based on the impact parameters of the leptons from b-baryon semileptonic decay. This paper also updates the published OPAL product branching ratio measurement <ref> [9] </ref>, which was obtained with the data recorded in the years 1990 and 1991. The inclusion of data collected up to the end of 1994 represents an approximate threefold increase in overall statistics for the lifetime measurement, and a ninefold increase for the product branching ratio. <p> The result is consistent with that given above, but despite the smaller statistical error, the total error is larger due to the larger systematic uncertainties for the neural net selection efficiency. This combined result supersedes the previously published OPAL result <ref> [9] </ref> of (2:9 0:5 0:7) 10 3 which was based on only the 1990-1991 data. Repeating the present analysis on this earlier data set gives a result of (3:4 0:6 0:3) 10 3 . <p> This result supersedes the previously published OPAL result <ref> [9] </ref>, and is consistent with results from other experiments [8].

Reference-contexts: This analysis actually measures the average lifetime and product branching ratio of weakly decaying b baryons weighted by their different production rates in Z 0 decays, branching ratios, and detection efficiencies. OPAL's previous value <ref> [10] </ref> of 1:05 +0:23 0:20 0:08 ps for the average b-baryon lifetime was measured from data collected between 1990 and 1992 using the distribution of decay lengths between the primary event vertex and the vertex formed by the lepton and fl. <p> After these track quality requirements, approximately 3.61 million hadronic Z 0 decay events are selected. The identification of b-baryon decays using charge-correlated fl-lepton combinations closely follows the selection previously employed to measure the b-baryon lifetime <ref> [10] </ref>. High-momentum electrons or muons having large transverse momentum with respect to their associated jet are first identified, then fl baryons are reconstructed, and finally requirements are placed upon the combination of the lepton and fl. <p> For the lifetime measurement, electrons are identified using an artificial neural net algorithm (see reference [18] for a more complete description) that is more efficient than the electron identification used in the previous lifetime analysis <ref> [10] </ref> and includes the endcap regions of the OPAL detector. The network is of a feed-forward type and was trained on simulated events to identify electrons on the basis of 12 measured quantities from the central tracking chamber and the electromagnetic calorimeters. <p> In both cases, electron candidates identified as originating from photon conversions are rejected as outlined in Ref. [20]. Electron and muon candidates are further required to pass the track selection criteria of Ref. <ref> [10] </ref>. All charged tracks and those electromagnetic clusters not associated with a charged track are grouped into jets using the JADE algorithm with the E0 recombination scheme [21] that has the invariant mass-squared cut-off set to x min = 49 (GeV=c 2 ) 2 . <p> The 490 excess right-sign charge combinations are mainly attributed to b-baryon decays, compared to the 157 excess right-sign combinations of OPAL's previous lifetime analysis <ref> [10] </ref>. When the less efficient alternative electron identification algorithm is used, 268 right-sign fle , and 128 wrong-sign fle + combinations are selected for use in the product branching ratio analysis. <p> The modelling of the decay length distributions and the fit procedure are identical to that of the previous analysis <ref> [10] </ref> but are described here for completeness. Since the decay length distribution for the background processes is not expected to be significantly different for the right-sign and wrong-sign fl-lepton combinations, the wrong-sign sample is used to define the background shape in the right-sign sample. <p> Because the secondary vertex error ellipse is very much elongated in the direction of the lepton, the decay length is biased to shorter values. This bias of the decay length estimator was also observed and corrected for in OPAL's previous b-baryon lifetime paper <ref> [10] </ref>, but was not completely understood due to insufficient Monte Carlo statistics. Using the fitted functional form found from the fast Monte Carlo sample, the lifetime fitting procedure was modified to include a correction to the decay length for each event depending on the value of j lep jet j. <p> This result represents a substantial improvement over the previously published OPAL result of t = 1:05 +0:23 0:20 0:08 ps <ref> [10] </ref>.

The maximum variation in fitted lifetime between this sample and a sample with zero fl + c lifetime was 0.005 ps. The presence of the fl + c therefore does not result in a significant bias. <p> Using the ansatz: BR (B ! fl` X)=BR (B ! p` X) = BR (B ! flX)=BR (B ! pX); (13) and the measurements BR (B ! flX) = (4:0 0:5)%, and BR (B ! pX) = (8:0 0:5)% <ref> [22] </ref> as input parameters for a Monte Carlo simulation, an upper limit on the contribution of this background to 29 the right-sign sample is found to be 2.8%, and a correction of (1:4 1:4)% is applied to encompass the entire possible range. <p> By studying the dE/dx distributions in the general Monte Carlo sample, this misidentification probability was determined to be small. From Monte Carlo studies using the measurement of BR (B ! flpX) = (2:50:4)% <ref> [22] </ref>, the contribution to the fl signal is predicted to be of the order of 0.2 events, and for the fle signal it is even smaller. This background is therefore negligible. <p> This result supersedes the previously published OPAL result [9], and is consistent with results from other experiments [8]. Using the measured branching ratio BR (fl + c ! flX) = (35 11)% <ref> [22] </ref>, one obtains: f (b ! fl b ) BR (fl b ! fl + c ` -X) = (8:3 2:8) 10 3 , under the assumption that all semileptonically decaying b baryons decay into c baryons as an intermediate state, and that the c baryons have the same branching ratios

The effect of uncertainties in b-quark fragmentation for the determination of the total efficiency was studied by reweighting the Monte Carlo samples using different * b parameters of the Peterson fragmentation function <ref> [24] </ref> from that which was used for their generation.

Reference-contexts: These samples were produced using EURODEC routines <ref> [25] </ref> for fl + c decays with branching ratios adjusted to agree with measured values [26]. A form factor to describe the energy transfer from the b baryon to the c baryon in the semileptonic decay of the b baryon also needs to be included. <p> These variations should also encompass the effects of some fraction of decays proceeding through higher mass charm baryon states. In addition, the decay branching ratios for fl b and fl + c in the EURODEC <ref> [25] </ref> decay tables are varied, giving maximum lifetime shifts of 0.015 ps.

Reference-contexts: In addition, to estimate the sensitivity of the measurements to the b-baryon polarization, a `polarized' sample was created with the same form factor, assuming the longitudinal b-quark polarization of 94%, as predicted by the Standard Model, is completely transferred to the b baryon <ref> [27] </ref>. Other samples including only the ffi b baryon were used to assess the 6 of masses. <p> No measurements have been made of the form factor, so differences in fitted lifetimes observed between the functions used for the central lifetime value, and those obtained using an alternate theoretical form factor <ref> [27] </ref>, and those using no form factor, were used to estimate a systematic error due to this source. The maximum lifetime differences observed are 0.018 ps for the decay length method and 0.03 ps for the impact parameter method. <p> However, since it is expected that the fl b baryons produced in Z 0 decays are polarized to some degree <ref> [27] </ref>, separate underlying physics distributions are found for a longitudinal polarization of 0% and the maximum possible polarization of 94% as expected for b quarks in the Standard Model. <p> As described in Section 6.3, the effect of the fl b decay modelling was studied by using Monte Carlo samples to simulate different form factors. Differences in efficiencies between the central value using the form factor of Ref. [2] and those obtained by using an alternative theoretical form factor <ref> [27] </ref>, or no form factor at all, were used to estimate a systematic error due to this source. The maximum observed difference in efficiency of 4:5% is assigned as the systematic uncertainty. <p> Typical theoretical estimates of BR (fl b ! fl + c ` -X) range from 2.45% [2] to 10-13% <ref> [27] </ref> indicating the strong need for a measurement of this branching ratio to allow the reliable extraction of f (b ! fl b ) from the measured product branching ratio.

Reference-contexts: The overall coefficient of statistical correlation is found to be 0.56. 23 7.2 Calculation of Errors in Combination The weight given to each of the two measurements is such that the total relative error =t (statistical plus systematic error in quadrature) is minimized as outlined in Ref. <ref> [32] </ref>. The correlation coefficient of 0.56 is used to multiply the statistical errors in the off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix while the systematic errors in the same category of the two methods are conservatively taken to be fully correlated.

Reference-contexts: In the framework of string fragmentation and the "popcorn" model <ref> [33] </ref>, as implemented in the JETSET Monte Carlo program, it is expected that these backgrounds contribute differently to the right-sign and wrong-sign samples. Take as an example a b-baryon semileptonic decay fl b ! fl + c ` -X followed by fl + c ! flX. <p> The imbalances predicted by Monte Carlo studies are shown in Table 7. To study modelling effects, these background source Monte Carlo studies were repeated using the JETSET input parameters given in [34], corresponding to 0% popcorn and a 95% popcorn model parameter <ref> [33] </ref>. The popcorn parameter is the probability that mesons are produced between baryon pairs and therefore determines the degree of correlation between the baryon pairs and the momentum spectrum of fragmentation fl baryons.
