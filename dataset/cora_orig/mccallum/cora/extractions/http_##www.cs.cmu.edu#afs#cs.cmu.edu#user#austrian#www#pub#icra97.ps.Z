Abstract: Modeling dynamic human control strategy (HCS), or human skill through learning is becoming an increasingly popular paradigm in many different research areas, such as intelligent vehicle systems, virtual reality, and space robotics. Validating the fidelity of such models requires that we compare the dynamic trajectories generated by the HCS model in the control feedback loop to the original human control data. To this end, we have developed a stochastic similarity measure based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) analysis capable of comparing dynamic, multi-dimen-sional trajectories. In this paper, we first derive and demonstrate properties of the proposed similarity measure for stochastic systems. We then apply the similarity measure to real-time human driving data by comparing different control strategies for different individuals. Finally, we show that the similarity measure outperforms the more traditional Bayes classifier in correctly grouping driving data from the same individual.

Reference-contexts: For such processes, model errors can feed back on themselves to produce trajectories which are not characteristic of the source process or are even potentially unstable <ref> [1] </ref>. Yet, most learning approaches today, including feedforward neural networks, utilize some static error measure as a test of convergence for the learning algorithm. While this measure is very useful during training, it offers no guarantees, theoretical or otherwise, about the dynamic behavior of the resulting learned model.

Reference-contexts: Using discrete HMMs for analysis of real-valued signals requires that continuous-valued data be converted to discrete symbols through pre-processing and vector quantization (see Section 2.4 below). Thus, a discrete HMM is completely defined by the following triplet <ref> [2] </ref>, where is the probabilistic state transition matrix, is the output probability matrix with discrete output symbols , and is the n-length initial state probability distribution vector.

Reference-contexts: Instead of sinusoidal basis functions, the Walsh transform decomposes a signal based on the orthonormal Walsh functions <ref> [3] </ref>. Certain types of sharply discontinuous human control data are characterized more concisely through the Walsh PSD than the Fourier PSD [4]. For each dimension of the human control data, we partition the data into overlapping window frames, and perform either a short-time FFT or FWT on each frame.
