Abstract: During the past year our group has been developing HipNav, a system which helps surgeons determine optimal, patient-specific acetabular implant placement and accurately achieve the desired implant placement during surgery. HipNav includes three components: a pre-operative planner, a range of motion simulator, and an intra-operative tracking and guidance system. The goals of the current HipNav system are to: 1) reduce dislocations following total hip replacement surgery due to acetabular malposition; 2) determine and potentially increase the safe range of motion; 3) reduce wear debris resulting from impingement of the implants femoral neck with the acetabular rim; and 4) track in real-time the position of the pelvis and acetabulum during surgery. The original implementation of the HipNav system was a proof-of-concept prototype which was useful for demonstrating the efficacy of this technology in-vitro. As the HipNav system progressed towards a clinical implementation, our efforts focussed on several practical development and validation issues. This paper describes our experience transforming HipNav from a proof-of-concept prototype into a robust clinical system, with emphasis on technical development and validation. Despite the highly applied nature of this endeavor, many fundamental research issues exist. The benefits of tightly coupling fundamental research together with applied development in our work are discussed.

Femoral and acetabular implants in impingement, and X-Ray of dislocation. femoral implant acetabular implant pelvis femur several methods for presenting CT data to the surgeon, and for updating implant place-ment based upon surgeon input <ref> [1] </ref>. Once the surgeon has selected the implant placement and size, the range of motion simulator is used to determine the femoral positions (in terms of extension/flexion, abduction/adduction, and internal/external rotation) at which impingement would occur for the specific implant design and placement. <p> Extensive functionality and usability testing has been performed on all three components, and highlights of these activities are summarized below. Large-scale, pre-operative planner usability tests are currently being performed by our group <ref> [1] </ref>. The goal of these tests is to compare several competing user interface designs to determine the best design for accomplishing the HipNav pre-operative planning task. Evaluation criteria are task accuracy, task completion time, and subjective factors such as user fatigue and confusion. <p> In these experiments, test users are asked to reproduce particular acetabular implant orientations using the pre-operative planner, based upon a physical pelvic model and coupled implant which are presented to them. A complete description of this work appears in <ref> [1] </ref>. For the range of motion simulator, we have concentrated our validation efforts on functional testing [8].

In addition to these technical issues, there are many clinical research problems related to HipNav, including demonstration of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. It has been our experience that performing technical research together with system de-velopment in a tightly coupled manner has several advantages.

Reference-contexts: In certain cases, impingement may result in dislocation, as seen in the X-ray of Fig. 1. The HipNav system has been developed to permit accurate placement of the acetabular component during surgery <ref> [3] </ref>. HipNav includes three components: a pre-operative planner, a range of motion simulator, and an intra-operative tracking and guidance system. The pre-operative planner allows the surgeon to manually specify the position of the acetabular component within the pelvis based upon pre-operative CT images.

Reference-contexts: The goal of the process is to determine a registration transformation which best aligns the discrete points with the surface model. An initial estimate of this transformation is first determined using manually specified anatomical landmarks to perform corresponding point registration <ref> [6] </ref>. Once this initial estimate is determined, the surface-based registration algorithm described in [15] uses the pre and intra-operative data to refine the initial transformation estimate.

Reference-contexts: In HipNav and related systems, there are many factors which contribute to system accuracy <ref> [14] </ref>. During HipNav validation, we have studied registration accuracy, surface model generation accuracy, and tool calibration accuracy. In [14], we described a method for validating the accuracy of surface-based registration and the need for task-specific measures of registration accuracy. <p> In HipNav and related systems, there are many factors which contribute to system accuracy <ref> [14] </ref>.

In [14], we described a method for validating the accuracy of surface-based registration and the need for task-specific measures of registration accuracy. For the HipNav task, it can be shown that only orientation errors in registration are relevant to the implant placement task. <p> This is because the system only provides feedback regarding implant orientation. Implant position is determined by a reaming process during which HipNav is not currently used. We have validated the accuracy of HipNavs registration system using the techniques described in <ref> [14] </ref>. During the four cadaver trials which have been performed to date, registration orientation errors have varied between roughly 0.5 degrees and 1.5 degrees. <p> These issues include: Automatic generation of bone surface models from CT-images, and validation of the accuracy of these models. Optimization of registration accuracy as a function of the collected data [13], and subsequent validation of this accuracy <ref> [14] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An initial estimate of this transformation is first determined using manually specified anatomical landmarks to perform corresponding point registration [6]. Once this initial estimate is determined, the surface-based registration algorithm described in <ref> [15] </ref> uses the pre and intra-operative data to refine the initial transformation estimate. Once the location of the pelvis is determined via registration, navigational feedback can be provided to the surgeon on a television monitor, as seen in Fig. 7.

Reference-contexts: A limitation of some registration systems used in orthopaedics is the need for fiducial pins to be surgically implanted into bone before pre-operative images are acquired (e.g., see <ref> [16] </ref>). An alternative technique which has been applied by several groups including ours uses surface geometry to perform registration [2][5][9][12][13][15].
