Abstract: BIBWEB is a distributed collaborative tool for sharing bibliographic references over the Internet. The BIBWEB system supports collaborative authoring by providing a shared database which can be accessed via a Web browser or a command line interface. A set of utilities support seamless integration of BIBWEB with document processing packages including L A T E X and FrameMaker. This paper describes the design and implementation of the BIBWEB system focusing on architectural features to support storage and retrieval of bibliographic data in a wide-area network, powerful search queries, and scalability in the number of clients and the size of the database. The BIBWEB system has been used extensively during the last six months in the Real-Time Computing Lab at the University of Michi-gan. The paper also describes our experiences with this tool highlighting user interface and performance issues.

Reference-contexts: Collaborative authoring requires a more sophisticated search engine from a database system and a more elegant user interface. A recently developed free software for DOS and Windows, called BibDB <ref> [1] </ref>, also allows creating, maintaining, and updating literature references in a format compatible with BIBT E X. This package supports a point-and-click user interface. However, it is intended primarily as a personal bibliographic database on PCs.

Reference-contexts: This system has a command line interface and an experimental X application interface based on the XView toolkit. The refdbms system, however, requires a copy of the database to be maintained at each client site, using a weak replication protocol <ref> [2] </ref> to update the replicas. The design philosophy of the BIBWEB system differs with the refdbms system in that we believe that a relatively small number of replicas together with client workspaces which maintain cached bibliography entries achieve a more scalable design.

Reference-contexts: Finally, Section 6 discusses future work. 2 Design Goals and Related Work The design of the BIBWEB system was motivated by our experiences in the Real-Time Computing Lab with the BIBDB and refdbms <ref> [3] </ref> bibliographic database systems. Our research environment is primarily UNIX based with L A T E X and FrameMaker as the two dominant text processing systems.

Reference-contexts: The BIBWEB system consists of five major components: * The Bibserver is the front end to a commercial relational database system which stores the bibliographic entries. * An Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server along with CGI scripts <ref> [4] </ref> support a forms-based HTML user interface available to any client with a Web browser. * A collection of text-based utilities support a command line interface to the system and also allows interfacing the bibliographic database with existing document processing systems. * BibSQL is an SQL query generator which translates HTML

Reference-contexts: This system supports adding new entries, editing existing references, and searching for entries using unique citation keys or imprecise patterns. It also supports seamless integration of BIBWEB database with the L A T E X <ref> [7] </ref> and FrameMaker document processing packages. BIBWEB has been on line for the last six months. Extensive feedback from our user community has resulted in a number of enhancement to the system which deal with user interface and performance issues. <p> The bibliographic entries in the relational database are stored in the same format as the BIBT E X references. The BIBWEB graphical and command line user interfaces both support BIBT E X <ref> [7] </ref> format for references. The BIBT E X package, which is a companion to the L A T E X text processing system, provides bibliographic reference indexing and formatting.

Reference-contexts: An examination of last 100 research reports from RTCL revealed that a typical paper has three co-authors with an average of 25 bibliographical entries. The work reported in this paper was primarily motivated by our experiences in RTCL during the last four years with BIBDB <ref> [8] </ref> which provided a shared bibliographic database on UNIX platform accessible from remote clients. BIBDB had been extensively used in our lab during the last several years and it was considered a great success as it facilitated collaborative authoring of documents. Unfortunately, BIBDB became a victim of its own success. <p> The interac-tivity of these systems is limited to email which may take overnight to be processed. Other systems have provided front-end interfaces to textual BIBT E X databases ([5, 9]. As pointed out in <ref> [8] </ref>, this approach is useful for small personal databases where a linear search of a file is acceptable. Collaborative authoring requires a more sophisticated search engine from a database system and a more elegant user interface.

Reference-contexts: Third, most of the system was written from scratch in the Perl scripting language <ref> [10] </ref> and maintenance became a serious problem. As the integrity of the database was compromised, users started to maintain their own individual bibliographic databases. Usability of the BIBDB system which enhanced 1 collaborative authoring of documents eventually became the cause of its downfall.
