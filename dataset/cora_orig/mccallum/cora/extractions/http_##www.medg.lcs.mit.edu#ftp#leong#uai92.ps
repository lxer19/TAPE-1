Title: Abstract  
Abstract: Automated decision making is often complicated by the complexity of the knowledge involved. Much of this complexity arises from the context-sensitive variations of the underlying phenomena. We propose a framework for representing descriptive, context-sensitive knowledge. Our approach attempts to integrate categorical and uncertain knowledge in a network formalism. This paper outlines the basic representation constructs, examines their expressiveness and efficiency, and discusses the potential applications of the framework.

Reference-contexts: For simplicity, we shall omit the universal context in our notations in this paper. The tuple notation allows concepts to be chained to form a new concept, analogous to the role chaining notion in KL-ONE <ref> (Brachman and Schmolze 1985) </ref>. For instance, ((Color # Royal Elephant) # Thailand) is a concept. The chaining expression is associative, and the embedded parentheses are usually omitted.

Reference-contexts: Given a decision problem, dynamic decision modeling involves selecting a subset of concepts and relations from a knowledge base, and assembling them into a closed-world decision model, e.g., an inuence diagram <ref> (Breese, Gold-man and Wellman 1991) </ref>. Our analysis indicated that an appropriate knowledge base representation would be a network formalism integrating categorical or absolute knowledge and uncertain knowledge in a context-sensitive manner. We propose such a representation design in this paper.

Reference-contexts: In the specialization hierarchy, this definition is analogous to the idea of derivative subclassification in OWL <ref> (Hawkinson 1975) </ref>. The inferences supported in our framework are generalized to all other categorical relations defined as well. 6 SUPPORTING DECISION MAKING We have seen how the relevant information in the Royal Elephant Example can be adequately captured in our representation framework.

Reference-contexts: A partial network representation of the concept royal elephant is shown in Figure 2. Concept The rationale behind our design is discussed in detail in <ref> (Leong 1991a) </ref>. In essence, the different relations defined reect the characteristics of the knowledge involved in supporting dynamic decision modeling. The interactions capture behavioral relations with varying degrees of certainty among the concepts; these relations support the task of identifying information with varying degrees of significance in a particular situation. <p> The detailed definitions can be found in <ref> (Leong 1991a) </ref> and (Wellman 1990b). Table 1 depicts the four types of interactions defined between any two concepts c1 and c2: association, precedence, inuence, and cause/inhibition. Table 1: Types of Interactions Interactions with known temporal ordering can only be used to describe concepts that represent events in the world. <p> allows, for example, the following types of inferences to be drawn on the categorizations: Elephant is a kind of animal Teeth is a kind of organ We can conclude that: Teeth of elephant is a kind of organ of animal The detailed definition of such inferences is again documented in <ref> (Leong 1991a) </ref>. In the specialization hierarchy, this definition is analogous to the idea of derivative subclassification in OWL (Hawkinson 1975). <p> We have briey sketched how the framework supports the pro-cess with the Tourists Decision Problem example. In practice, we have also briey examined this issue by hand-building and hand-evaluating a small test knowledge base in the domain of opportunistic pulmonary infections with suspected AIDS <ref> (Leong 1991a) </ref>; the results are promising. Unfortunately, a rigorous evaluation is impossible until we have an implemented system, which is planned for the near future. We believe our representation framework is applicable in some other problem solving tasks as well.

Reference-contexts: In particular, network or graph representations are found to be very effective in expressing the variations and exceptions involved. There have been many efforts at integrating categorical or hierarchical knowledge with uncertain knowledge <ref> (Lin and Goebel 1990) </ref>(Saffiotti 1990)(Yen and Bonissone 1990). No existing framework, however, captures the essence of both, say, the inheritance graph of a specialization or IS A hierarchy, and the conditional dependency graph of a probabilistic network.

Reference-contexts: Hence, to automate the decision making process, there must be a general way to represent the context-sensitive variations of the relevant information. Research in path-based inheritance in hierarchical systems (Touretzky 1987) and uncertain reasoning with belief networks <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref> has shed some light on the characteristics and the complexities of a general framework for reasoning with context-sensitive knowledge.

Reference-contexts: The presence of conicting concept descriptions gives rise to the exceptions and multiple inheritance problems in inheritance, and the partial matching problem in recognition <ref> (Shastri 1989) </ref>. Since we assume our knowledge base is a fully established network of concept descriptions, we do not anticipate most of the difficulties that research in inheritance theory or default reasoning (Touretzky, Horty and Thomason 1987) encounters.

Reference-contexts: To balance between intuitive expressiveness and semantic precision, our definitions integrate a temporal ordering notion and a qualitative probabilistic interpretation. Each interaction in our framework has two components: temporal precedence, with known or unknown as values, and qualitative probabilistic inuence <ref> (Wellman 1990b) </ref>, with positive, negative, or unknown as values. Different additive combinations of these values allow us to express the behavioral relationships across a spectrum of uncertainty. The interpretations for the temporal precedence values are straightforward. <p> The detailed definitions can be found in (Leong 1991a) and <ref> (Wellman 1990b) </ref>. Table 1 depicts the four types of interactions defined between any two concepts c1 and c2: association, precedence, inuence, and cause/inhibition. Table 1: Types of Interactions Interactions with known temporal ordering can only be used to describe concepts that represent events in the world. <p> The operator is for combining interaction chains and the operator is for combining parallel interactions. The definitions are consistent with the operators for combining inuence chains and parallel inuences in qualitative probabilistic networks (QPNs). The corresponding operations are commutative, associative, and distributive, just like ordinary multiplication and addition <ref> (Wellman 1990b) </ref>. The tables are indexed from interaction entries in row then column, and the net interaction is read from their inter section. For example, ; .
