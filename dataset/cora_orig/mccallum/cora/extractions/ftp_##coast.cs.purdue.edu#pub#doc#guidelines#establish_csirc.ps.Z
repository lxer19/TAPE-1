Reference-contexts: Incident response is a process whereby incidents are identified, contained, and resolved. There are many issues and details involved in each of these steps; a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this guide. Readers are encouraged to examine [HOLBROOK91], <ref> [BRAND89] </ref>, and [SCHULTZ90] for discussion on incident response. This chapter concentrates on operational activities and issues that are generally involved in incident response, regardless of the type of incidents, computing environments, or organization. <p> Talk candidly with the public affairs office and ensure that they understand the technical issues, so that they may communicate more effectively and accurately with the press. False or misleading information may ultimately cause more damage to the agency's image than the incident itself <ref> [BRAND89] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Both teams have handled and resolved many incidents and regularly issue alerts concerning new vulnerabilities and software defects. Several other government and commercial organizations also created CSIRC efforts <ref> [DDN89] </ref>, [FEDELI91]. In 1990, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in conjunction with the CERT/CC, DOE's CIAC, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other agency response teams, organized a cooperative activity known as the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST).

Existing management structures could be used to bubble information up and down throughout the agency <ref> [FEDELI91] </ref>. This model may work well in certain environments, but could also result in some duplication of effort and prevent incidents from being handled in a timely manner. In summary, it is difficult to prescribe one best structure, as each agency has different requirements. <p> It is important that these agencies document the lessons learned in this process, so that other agencies and groups can gain from their experiences. Of particular use is <ref> [FEDELI91] </ref>, [SCHULTZ90], and [RFC1244]. ESTABLISHING A CSIRC 30 ESTABLISHING A CSIRC

Reference-contexts: Outbreaks of viruses or system penetrations appear in the press, causing embarrassment and possible loss of public confidence. These situations could cause agencies to face extreme expense in productivity, significant damage to their systems, loss of funds, and damage to their reputations <ref> [GAO89] </ref>. Clearly, agencies now need to take action prior to suffering the consequences of a serious computer security problem. 2.4 The CSIRC Concept A Computer Security Incident Response Capability is that part of a computer security effort that provides the capability to respond to computer security threats rapidly and effectively.

Reference-contexts: This approach results in a highly centralized CSIRC which is most feasible when the constituency is aligned along a centralized communications network. Several working models for centralized and distinct CSIRC activities exist <ref> [PETHIA90] </ref>, [SCHULTZ90]. In the case of the CERT/CC and DOE's CIAC, DARPA and DOE respectively have created new organizations as opposed to augmenting existing ones.

Reference-contexts: While many vendors' products contain some integrity-enhancing mechanisms, systems are more at risk to threats such as viruses and worms that target integrity and availability. The growth of networks now provides more freedom of range for malicious activity <ref> [QUARTERM90] </ref>. A networked system whose manager and users practice poor security poses significant threats to other systems on the network by enabling the spread of malicious software or by use as a springboard for malicious user activity.

Reference-contexts: Due to computer security requirements being driven in the past by concerns primarily with secrecy, most advances in computer security have been oriented towards protection of data confidentiality <ref> [RISK91] </ref> and not integrity or availability. However, threats such as computer viruses and worms are generally defeated by mechanisms for ensuring integrity and availability. While many vendors' products contain some integrity-enhancing mechanisms, systems are more at risk to threats such as viruses and worms that target integrity and availability.

Reference-contexts: Appropriate legal advisors need to review the charter and all other procedures in use by a CSIRC. 3.5.2 Components of a CSIRC Charter A CSIRC charter should include the following (or equivalent) sections to describe the purpose and scope of the effort <ref> [STEINBERG89] </ref>: 1. Executive Summary 2. Responsibilities 3. Methods 4. Reporting Structure and Staffing Executive Summary to quickly acquaint readers with the existence of the CSIRC, its overall scope of responsibilities, and other basic information. Responsibilities a description of what the CSIRC is and is not purporting to do.

Reference-contexts: The charter lists the requirements that the CSIRC must satisfy and lays out the boundaries or scope of the CSIRC effort. It should be made available to the agency for use as a reference. 3.5.1 Legal Issues in Determining a Charter <ref> [STEWART89] </ref> notes that CSIRC activity raises several legal issues, mostly involving liabilities that may be incurred as a result of intentional, reckless or negligent conduct on the part of the CSIRC that could cause injury to another party. 3 Even though a CSIRC is performing a useful service, it may be <p> incurred as a result of intentional, reckless or negligent conduct on the part of the CSIRC that could cause injury to another party. 3 Even though a CSIRC is performing a useful service, it may be liable to software vendors, users, or others if it performs its work negli 3 <ref> [STEWART89] </ref> is oriented towards those who would establish Computer Security Response Centers (CSRCs) for the Internet; it does not purport to provide definitive legal advice. <p> If these procedures are not established beforehand, embarrassing and potentially damaging situations could arise that may damage the agency's reputation and expose it to legal problems <ref> [STEWART89] </ref>. 4.3.1 Identifying the Existence of an Incident and its Scope Upon learning of a possible incident, a CSIRC needs to take steps to verify that the incident actually does exist. <p> The reports must be held confidential and reported to the proper vendor (s) in a timely manner. It may be useful to solicit the vendor's response and help when writing a report of the defect or vulnerability to the constituency <ref> [STEWART89] </ref>. <p> When writing about software defects or vulnerabilities, a CSIRC should avoid possible copyright, defamation, patent, or trade secret issues with the vendor (s) in question <ref> [STEWART89] </ref>. Value-neutral words should be chosen to describe the problems, such as "possible software defect" or "potential security vulnerability" as opposed to words that imply vendor negligence or guilt.
