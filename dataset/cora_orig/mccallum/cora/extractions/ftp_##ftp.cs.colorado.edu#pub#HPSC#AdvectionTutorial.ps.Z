Reference-contexts: The line going through point d is a characteristic. role in determining the characteristics of a solution. It is sometimes called the Courant number in recognition of the work by Courant, Friedrichs, and Lewy <ref> [Courant et al 67] </ref> in which the concept of stability was introduced.

Reference-contexts: The mathematical analysis of the algorithms we discuss requires an elementary knowledge of Fourier series. You may wish to read the Numerical Analysis Review <ref> [Fosdick & Jessup 95] </ref> to refresh your knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Since equation (25) is based on a finite difference approximation to the advection equation having an error that is second order in t we say that the accuracy of equation (25), and the Leapfrog algorithm, is second order. See the book by Richtmyer and Morton <ref> [Richtmyer & Morton 67, pages 67,68] </ref> for a more detailed explanation of "order of accuracy" of finite difference approximations to partial differential equations. Equation (25) requires values at two time levels, n and n 1, in order to compute the solution at the next time level, n + 1.

Reference-contexts: Another source with some results on amplification of amplitude and phase speed for different algorithms is given in a paper by Wen-Yih Sun <ref> [Sun 93] </ref>. A considerable amount of time was spent on the analysis of the algorithms because we believe the reader should understand not only what an algorithm does but why.
