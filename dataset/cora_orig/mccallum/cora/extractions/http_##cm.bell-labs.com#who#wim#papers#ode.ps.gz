Title: Wavelet Multiresolution Analyses adapted for the Fast Solution of Boundary Value Ordinary Differential Equations  
Author: Bjorn Jawerth Wim Sweldens 
Abstract: We present ideas on how to use wavelets in the solution of boundary value ordinary differential equations. Rather than using classical wavelets, we adapt their construction so that they become (bi)orthogonal with respect to the inner product defined by the operator. The stiffness matrix in a Galerkin method then becomes diagonal and can thus be trivially inverted. We show how one can construct an O(N ) algorithm for various constant and variable coefficient operators.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The purpose of this paper is to use wavelets in the solution of certain linear ordinary differential equations of the form L u (x) = f (x) for x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; where L = m X a j (x) D j ; and with appropriate boundary conditions on u (x) for x = 0; 1. Currently there exist two major solution techniques. <p> We now need to find an operator scaling function . The antiderivative of the original scaling function is not compactly supported and hence not suited. We instead construct the operator scaling function by taking the convolution of the original scaling function with the indicator function on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, = fl [0;1] ; and similar for the dual functions. We will show that these functions indeed generate a mul-tiresolution analysis. <p> Note also that if true, this property would make the use of wavelets superfluous. 4.1 Algorithm We will describe the algorithm in the case of periodic boundary conditions. This implies that the basis functions on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> are just the periodization of the basis functions on the real line. Let S = V n and consider the basis f n;l j 0 6 l &lt; 2 n g. <p> This requires the use of special boundary wavelets as described in <ref> [1] </ref>. With only a slight change of basis one can then incorporate Dirichlet, Neumann, mixed and periodic boundary conditions. The details of this construction go beyond the scope of this paper.

Reference-contexts: As a result, one does not 6 obtain a full diagonalization, but rather a decoupling of equations corresponding to different levels. Our idea is different from the technique presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. There wavelets are used to efficiently compute the inverse of the matrix that comes from a finite difference discretization. It is also shown that the wavelets provide a diagonal preconditioner which yields uniformly bounded condition numbers. In [12, 19] antiderivates of wavelets are used in a Galerkin method.

Reference-contexts: It is well understood by now that this can be solved with multiresolution techniques such as multigrid or hierarchical basis functions [11, 20]. Multiresolution finite element bases can provide preconditioners which result in a uniformly bounded condition number, see e.g. <ref> [3, 8, 16] </ref>. The convergence of the linear system is then independent of the problem size. The research presented here is motived by the question of how good wavelets are for the solution of ordinary differential equations.
