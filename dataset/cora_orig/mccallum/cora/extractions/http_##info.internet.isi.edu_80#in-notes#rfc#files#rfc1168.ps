Title: Working Group Request for Comments: A. DeSchon  INTERMAIL AND COMMERCIAL MAIL RELAY SERVICES STATUS OF THIS  
Author: Westine, DeSchon, Postel Ward [Page ] A. WestineNetwork J. Postel C. E. Ward USC/ISI 
Date: July 1990 1168  
Pubnum: MEMO  
Abstract: This RFC discusses the history and evolution of the Intermail and Commercial mail systems. The problems encountered in operating a store-and-forward mail relay between commercial systems such as Telemail, MCI Mail and Dialcom are also discussed. This RFC provides information for the Internet community, and does not specify any standard. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Reference-contexts: A major goal of the CMR project is to make the link between networks as transparent as possible, allowing Internet users to use off-the-shelf mail programs. Making commercial address formats fit the Internet standard is a major task <ref> [2] </ref>. Compatibility with Internet addressing standards is also a concern. <p> The colon is another example. Dialcom uses it as the delimiter between host and mailbox. However, the colon is a special character in the Internet mail standard <ref> [2] </ref>. Users can avoid this problem by using the SFH and placing the Dialcom address at the beginning of the message text. Although the CMR can accept addresses with colons, many Internet hosts and relays are unable to accept addresses that contain colons. <p> This can cause significant delays. Problems have also been caused by confusion about which hosts are mail relays between the Internet and other systems compatible with the Internet mail standard <ref> [2] </ref>. (e.g., BITNET, UUCP, and CSNET). When the CMR was implemented, a decision was made that the CMR would not keep track of these mail relays.

Reference-contexts: DESCRIPTION OF THE CMR SYSTEM The Multi-channel Memo Distribution Facility (MMDF) is used as the system mail software because of its notion of separating the mail queue into separate channels <ref> [5] </ref>. This makes it easy to dedicate a channel/queue combination to each commercial system. Internet mail comes in over the standard SMTP port, and the system parses the destination address, queuing the message in the proper outgoing queue.
