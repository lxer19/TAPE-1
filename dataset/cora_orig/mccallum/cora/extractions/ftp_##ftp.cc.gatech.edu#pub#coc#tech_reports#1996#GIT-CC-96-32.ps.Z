Abstract: TeD is a language designed mainly for modeling telecommunication networks. The TeD language specification is separated into two parts | (1) a meta language (2) an external language. The meta language specification is concerned with the high-level description of the structural and behavioral interfaces of various network elements. The external language specification is concerned with the detailed low-level description of the implementation of the structure and behavior of the network elements. The meta language, called MetaTeD, is described in this document (An external language specification, with C ++ as the external language, is described in a separate related document.).

Reference-contexts: Our basic approach towards the design of such a language was as follows. The analogous language for hardware/VLSI domain, namely, the VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL), was examined <ref> [1] </ref>. Several concepts were borrowed from VHDL and suitably modified to suit the telecommunication domain. Some VHDL concepts that are specific to the hardware domain were ignored, and new concepts appropriate to the telecommunication domain were added.
