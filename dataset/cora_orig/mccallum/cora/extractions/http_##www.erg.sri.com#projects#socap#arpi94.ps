Title: SOCAP: System for Operations Crisis Action Planning

Abstract: In this paper, we report on our past and recent experiences in applying an AI generative planning system, called System for Interactive Planning and Execution (SIPE-2), to the problem of generating crisis action operations plans in a joint military domain * . We describe our motivation for selecting a generative planner, the application itself (including the second Integrated Feasibility Demonstration, IFD-2) , and the lessons we learned in creating it. We also report on the applied research we performed to address the lessons learned in IFD-2. This involved integrating the generative planner with several complementary technologies that were available through the Planning Initiative (PI): a temporal reasoner, a case-based reasoner, and the capacity analysis component of a scheduling system. These technology integration experiments (TIEs) were executed within the Common Prototyping Environment (CPE). We discuss both the unique characteristics of each TIE and the general features that contributed to the success of each one. Finally, we discuss future work in the areas of new applications and further work on the scheduling system TIE.
