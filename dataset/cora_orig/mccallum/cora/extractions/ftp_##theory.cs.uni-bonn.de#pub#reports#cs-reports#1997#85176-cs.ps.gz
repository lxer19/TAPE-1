Abstract: The bandwidth problem is the problem of numbering the vertices of a given graph G such that the maximum difference between the numbers of adjacent vertices is minimal. The problem has a long and varied history and is known to be NP -hard Papadimitriou [Pa 76]. Recently for dense graphs a constant ratio approximation algorithm for this problem has been constructed in Karpinski, Wirtgen and Ze-likovsky [KWZ 97]. In this paper we prove that the bandwidth problem on the dense instances remains N P -hard.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The bandwidth problem on graphs has a very long and interesting history cf. <ref> [CCDG 82] </ref>. Formally the bandwidth minimization problem is defined as follows. Let G = (V; E) be a simple graph on n vertices. A numbering of G is a one-to-one mapping f : V ! f1; :::; ng.

Reference-contexts: The problem of finding the bandwidth of a graph is NP-hard [Pa 76], even for trees with maximum degree 3 <ref> [GGJK 78] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We start with the standard PARTITION problem: given a set A = f1; :::; ng and sizes s : A ! ZZ + the question is, whether there is a subset I A, such that P P i2AnI s (i)? The problem is N P -complete (cf. <ref> [GJ 79] </ref> [SP12]). <p> Theorem 8 ([ACP 87]) PARTIAL-k-TREE is N P -hard. Proof: (Sketch) Let G = (V; E) be a input graph of the N P -complete MINIMUM CUT LINEAR ARRANGEMENT (MCLA) problem (for the proof of N P - completeness see <ref> [GJ 79] </ref> [GT44]): given G and a positive integer k, does there exist a numbering f of V , such that c (f; G) = max jffu; vg 2 Ejf (u) j &lt; f (v)gj k We will construct a bipartite graph G 0 = (A _ [B; E 0 ).

Reference-contexts: A caterpillar is a special kind of a tree consisting of a simple chain, the body, with an arbitrary number of simple chains, the hairs, attached to the body by coalescing an endpoint of the added chain with a vertex of the body. In Karpinski, Wirtgen and Zelikovsky <ref> [KWZ 97] </ref> introduced a 3-approximation algorithm for everywhere ffi-dense graphs. Definition 1 ([AKK 95]) We call a graph G (everywhere) ffi-dense, if the minimum degree ffi (G) is at least ffin. We call it dense in average, if the number of edges is in (n 2 ). <p> We call it dense in average, if the number of edges is in (n 2 ). In this paper we show that the bandwidth problem on dense graphs is N P -hard, answering the question raised in <ref> [KWZ 97] </ref>. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a simple proof for the N P - hardness of the bandwidth problem for dense graphs in average.
