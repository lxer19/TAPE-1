Abstract: Recent incidents of unauthorized computer intrusion have brought about discussion of the ethics of breaking into computers. Some individuals have argued that as long as no significant damage results, break-ins may serve a useful purpose. Others counter with the expression that the break-ins are almost always harmful and wrong. This article lists and refutes many of the reasons given to justify computer intrusions. It is the author's contention that break-ins are ethical only in extreme situations, such as a life-critical emergency.

Reference-contexts: In the following discussion, I will assume that such conflicts are not the root cause of the break-ins; such situations should very rarely present themselves. 3 Motivations Individuals who break into computer systems or who write vandalware usually use one of a few rationalizations for their actions. (See, for example, <ref> [11] </ref> and the discussion in [12].) Most of these individuals would never think to walk down a street, trying every door to find one unlocked, then search through the drawers of the furniture inside.

Reference-contexts: Browsing through a system does not expose someone to the broad scope of theory and practice in computing, nor does it provide the critical feedback so important to a good education (cf. <ref> [15, 16] </ref>). Neither does writing a virus or worm program and releasing it into an unsupervised environment provide any proper educational experience. By analogy, stealing cars and joyriding does not provide one with an education in mechanical engineering, nor does pouring sugar in the gas tank.
