Abstract: The technique of Virtual Paths is used in ATM networks to perform bandwidth allocation for virtual circuits and to simplify setting up of virtual circuits in response to connection requests. In this paper, we describe a new technique called Virtual Trees that can be used for bandwidth allocation in ATM networks. A Virtual Tree corresponds to pre-allocated bandwidth along a set of links in the network that form a tree rooted at a source node and leading to various destinations. The use of Virtual Trees provides more flexibility to a source node in setting up a virtual circuit and results in smaller rejection probabilities for connection requests. Virtual Trees retain all the advantages of Virtual Paths but have a better performance potential. We present an optimization model for Bandwidth Allocation for Virtual Tree configurations and present the results of a simulation study comparing the performance of Virtual Trees with that of Virtual Paths.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a switching and multiplexing technique developed for Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN) networks that makes it possible to achieve the multiplexing of different kinds of traffic while providing individual quality of service guarantees for each traffic type <ref> [3, 12, 19] </ref>. The CCITT standard for the ATM Layer defines two types of connections: Virtual Channel (VC) connections and Virtual Path (VP) connections [3, 19]. <p> The CCITT standard for the ATM Layer defines two types of connections: Virtual Channel (VC) connections and Virtual Path (VP) connections <ref> [3, 19] </ref>. The concept of a Virtual Channel (VC) is similar to that of a virtual circuit in traditional networks, namely, a logical unidirectional association that defines a connection between a source and its destination.

Reference-contexts: The Virtual Path concept provides several advantages such as allowing simpler network architectures, eliminating the need for call-by-call routing and allowing easier implementation of dynamic bandwidth allocation schemes <ref> [4, 15, 16, 17] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We estimate that a linear cost function is good enough to make the analysis simpler and to provide a good abstraction of more realistic situations. In a network G, we can enumerate J = jB 0 B t 0 j spanning trees <ref> [5] </ref>, where B 0 is the incidence matrix of the network G minus a row (i.e., reduced incidence matrix). A spanning tree from G is denoted by T j , j = 1::J , which represents the j th tree from the set of trees enumerated from G.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm for call admission with Virtual Trees is described in more detail in <ref> [13] </ref>. It requires the access node to maintain the above information in appropriate data structures. All of the information needed to set up a VC is thus available locally at the access node, just as in VPs.

Reference-contexts: This takes the form of a tree rooted at the source node whence the name Virtual Tree. In a Virtual Path, different Virtual Channels may share the bandwidth of the VP resulting in better multiplexing of the traffic than if the network allocated bandwidth individually for each VC <ref> [14] </ref>. Because of this multiplexing effect, a smaller amount of bandwidth may be allocated to the VP than the sum of the bandwidths of all VCs traversing it. Put another way, the Equivalent Bandwidth required by each VC decreases as more traffic is multiplexed on the same VP.
