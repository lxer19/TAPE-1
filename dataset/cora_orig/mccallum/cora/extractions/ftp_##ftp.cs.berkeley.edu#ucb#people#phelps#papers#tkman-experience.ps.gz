Title: Two Years with TkMan: Lessons and Innovations Or, Everything I Needed to Know about Tcl/Tk

Abstract: Among Tcl/Tk applications, TkMan is unusual. Whereas Tcl was written to glue together C functions, TkMan is written entirely in Tcl. And TkMan is the beneficiary of years of battle testing by 1000s of users on every avor of UNIX. The extreme position created by the demands of this large, diverse audience and the (self-imposed) limitation of remaining strictly within Tcl brought to the fore a severe set of implementation issues, and provoked a variety of solutions ranging from general methods to a low-level bag of tricks with regard to speeding up Tcl scripts, exploiting Tcl as its own scripting language, configuring applications and interoperating with other tools. Although developed to meet these particular, extreme requirements, most of the resulting solutions can be broadly applied, and this paper shares this lore with the aim of helping other authors develop elegant, efficient and robust Tcl/Tk-based applications.

Reference-contexts: If one does not with to change Tcl semantics in this way, it is preferable to use the semantics-preserving tcl_cruncher <ref> [Dema] </ref>, which strips comments and reduces whitespace (wherever it appears) to a minimum. Reduce input size and command count TkMans external manual page filter (written in C) produces Tcl commands that insert the text, set tags for fonts and other presentation attributes, and set marks at page section heads.

Reference-contexts: One might think that writing at the Tcl level would automatically make the code portable across all platforms that support the Tcl interpreter. But environment differences thwart this ideal. In writing Expect <ref> [Libe94a] </ref>, its author lamented that he had to implement over 20 interfaces to handle ptys [Libe94b] to accomodate the differences among avors of UNIX.

Reference-contexts: The commands map better to objects in the application ontology, and the implementation of the intensional tkmandesc commands can change without affecting existing customization code. The tkmandesc layer made possible a user-transparent solution to a problem introduced with the full-text searching package Glimpse <ref> [Manb94] </ref>. Usually pages are indexed in their hierarchy so that Glimpse indexes, though small, can be shared and thereby ammortized across users. The question was where to index isolated directories not part of any hierarchy. For performance reasons, it would be better to index them as a group.

Reference-contexts: As an exercise, the current author rewrote this Xt/Xmu-based clock in Tcl/Tk. It took a mere 10% of the number of lines. On the other hand, the new clock, called tkchrom <ref> [Phel] </ref>, required one megabyte of supporting libraries to run! For small applications like this, shared libraries would be a great relief. If youre going to pay for it, you may as well use it. What can one do with a general purpose programing language in a clock? Reminders, unrestricted reminders.

Reference-contexts: Especially if it requires specific knowledge of the system, take this setting out of the Makefile and instead determine the correct value at application runt-ime if possible. This can also makes scripts portable across architectures. Better still, write a graphical installation tool such as found in exmh <ref> [Welc] </ref>, which can interrogate the environment at installation time. It still may be wise to defer some checks to application runtime, however, in order to dynamically customize the script for different machines and to catch changes in the environment since installation.
