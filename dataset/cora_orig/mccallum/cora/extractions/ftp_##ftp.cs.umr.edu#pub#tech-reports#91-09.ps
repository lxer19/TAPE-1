Abstract: This paper explores the use of Simulated Annealing as an optimization technique for the problem Composite Material Stock Cutting. The shapes are not constrained to be convex polygons or even regular shapes. However, due to the composite nature of the material, the orientation of the shapes on the stock is restricted. For placements of various shapes, we show how to determine a cost function, annealing parameters, and performance.

Reference-contexts: Determination of the initial temperature T, the decrement factor of T at each step (i.e. how T is updated) and the determining of thermal equilibrium is called the cooling schedule. Convergence with various cooling schedules has been proven <ref> [AaLa85] </ref>. Convergence at each temperature, or control parameter, means that the inner loop has reached thermal equilibrium. Convergence of the entire algorithm means that an optimum configuration, or cost value, has been reached. An exponentially long time may be required for convergence, depending on the size of the problem. <p> A small move is defined as a move that causes a small difference. Large moves at high temperatures allows the algorithm to avoid local minimum. 4.2 Cooling Schedule A summary of some effective cooling schedules is presented in <ref> [AaLa85] </ref>. The initial value of the control parameter T should be large enough to allow the algorithm to accept any new configurations regardless of the change in cost. Let the notation T i refer to the temperature at the i th iteration of the outer loop. <p> The time required for the inner loop to reach quasi-equilibrium is another parameter of the cooling schedule. There is a trade off between time and accuracy. Theory <ref> [AaLa85] </ref> says that for convergence, every state must be visited infinitely often. Obviously, in practical uses, this is not feasible. The length of the inner loop should be long enough to provide a good solution, but not so long as to provide little extra information for the time spent. <p> Therefore, some heuristic must be used to determine inner loop iterations. One common cooling schedule is described by van Laarhoven and Aarts <ref> [AaLa85] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The main difficulty is the maintenance of a global state S of the annealing process. This is further complicated by the desirability of using distributed memory multiprocessors or multicomputers <ref> [AtSe88] </ref> which have no single global picture of the state. We are currently working on multigrid methods for this problem. In an asynchronous multigrid, both the number of processors and the granularity change simultaneously during the problem solution.

Reference-contexts: The difficulty is in determining quickly the optimal decisions. Otherwise, the problem degrades into enumeration of the decisions and determining which is the best. This has exponential complexity. Studies of dynamic programming approaches to the stock cutting problem have been done by Beasley <ref> [Beas85a, - 4 - Beas85b] </ref>, Sarker [Sark85]. Another class of heuristics often used are tree-search methods. This method enumerates all possible solutions in a tree like organization. Many different tree organizations may exist for the solution space. Heuristics exist for finding the solution to the problem by traversing the tree.

Reference-contexts: It is difficult to determine which path to start on and once on a particular path, determining whether the path is worth traversing, i.e. lower costs possible or whether to proceed on a different path. Work has been done by Christofides and Whitlock <ref> [ChWh77] </ref>, Hinxman [Hinx80], and Beasley [Beas85a,Beas85b]. Another heuristic used is the iterative improvement method. Application of the method of iterative improvement requires the definition of a solution space, a cost function, and a set of moves that can be used to modify a solution.

The idea was derived from the algorithm by Metropolis [Metr53]. There is an analogy between a combinatorial optimization problem and the problem of determining the lowest-energy ground state of a physical system.

Reference-contexts: Annealing at several different granularities can utilize a coarse approximation at the high T and utilize a fine granularity at lower values of T. This structure yields a multigrid approach to the problem such as exploited in <ref> [FrMK90] </ref>. The problem structure is formulated as a pyramid as shown in Figure 15. - 46 - l = 1 creases by 4. - 47 - The second alternative is to appeal to parallel processing. The main difficulty is the maintenance of a global state S of the annealing process.

Reference-contexts: The stock cutting problem is an example of a large scale optimization problem. It is unlikely to be solved by an algorithm whose run time is bounded by a polynomial function. This is an example of an NP-hard problem <ref> [GaJo79] </ref>. This means that this problem requires a computing effort that increases exponentially with the problem size. Since the stock cutting problem is of practical importance, efficient approximation algorithms, namely, algorithms that do not produce optimal but rather close-to-optimal solutions, have been developed.

Reference-contexts: For large temperatures, the the second term of the above equation dominates. However, as the temperature decreases the first term will dominate. 3.3 Metropolis Algorithm It is sometimes difficult to work with ensembles of physical systems.

For a given temperature T, the Metropolis method is a way to sample states of the physical system with the Boltzmann distribution.
