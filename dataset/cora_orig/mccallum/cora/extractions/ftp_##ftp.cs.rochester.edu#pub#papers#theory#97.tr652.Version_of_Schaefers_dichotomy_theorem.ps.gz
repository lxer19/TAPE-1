Abstract: Gabriel Istrate The University of Rochester Computer Science Department Rochester, New York 14627 Technical Report 652 March 1997 Abstract We study the complexity of generalized satisfiability problem for formulas whose variables occur at most twice. We prove a dichotomy theorem for a special case of generalized satisfiability with constants and a sufficient condition, inspired by matching theory, for its polynomial time solvability.

Reference-contexts: Example 1 One important packing problem that satisfies the conditions of the previous corollary is packing by edges and triangles, the special case when the family F contains one triangle; it follows from <ref> [CHP82] </ref> that the there is a polynomial time algorithm for this problem. <p> Unfortunately we don't have a characterization of all relations that can be represented by triangles. Observation 4.5 The F -packing problem is known to be in P in several other cases: * When F is a finite family of hypomatchable graphs (see <ref> [CHP82] </ref>). * [LP93] contains a complete characterizations of graphs G for which the fGg-packing problem is in P. Most of these cases satisfy the "loop elimination" condition.

Reference-contexts: Therefore it is not surprising that Theorem 5.5 below can be proved using a variant of Edmonds' matching algorithm [LP86]. We will, however, avoid developing such an algorithm, using instead a reduction to a problem from <ref> [Cor88] </ref>. The polynomial time solvability of this problem was proved by a reduction to the problem of packing by edges and triangles. This motivates the definition of a general framework for reducing a generalized satisfiability problem to a packing problem. <p> Observation 5.7 Such an algorithm exists if every relation involved is symmetric and all members of its spectrum have the same parity: in this case the satisfiability problem can be easily interpreted as a generalized matching problem and the required fact is stated in <ref> [Cor88] </ref>. Definition 5.8 Let A be an assignment for S-formula . A flip of A is an assignment B that differs from A for exactly one variable.

Reference-contexts: Note, however, that the classification of hard/easy cases given by Schaefer's Dichotomy Theorem does not hold if we take such a restriction into consideration: kSAT is NP-complete for every k 3 but, as Kratochv il, Savicky and Tuza have shown <ref> [KST93] </ref>, it is solvable in polynomial time if every variable occurs at most b 2 k ek c times (see also [MR95]). In this paper we study a nontrivial instance of this problem, the case when every variable occurs at most twice. <p> Such a threshold value exists for kSAT , k 3, <ref> [KST93] </ref>, (although there is no formula for its location). A natural question is whether such a jump from trivial satisfiability to NP-completeness exists in all the cases when SAT (S) is NP-complete (that is if we can combine Tovey's theorem and Schaefer's Dichotomy theorem).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The notions of polynomial time solvability and NP-hardness provide rigorous definitions for the intuitive concepts of tractable (and intractable) problems. However, Ladner <ref> [Lad75] </ref> showed that, if P 6= NP, then there are problems that are neither in P nor NP-complete. Still, most versions of "natural" combinatorial problems fall into one of these two categories, and for some of them a complete characterization of easy/hard cases has been obtained.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the problem of deciding the satisfiability of an S 0 -formula with this additional property is reducible to the problem of deciding the existence of a perfect matching in a graph, which can be solved in polynomial time <ref> [LP86] </ref>. By a slightly different argument (that involves results in generalized matching theory) one can show that SAT (S 0 ; 2) 2 P. The previous construction shows that the complexity of SAT (S; 2) is related to the complexity of some problems in general matching theory. <p> The previous construction shows that the complexity of SAT (S; 2) is related to the complexity of some problems in general matching theory. Therefore it is not surprising that Theorem 5.5 below can be proved using a variant of Edmonds' matching algorithm <ref> [LP86] </ref>. We will, however, avoid developing such an algorithm, using instead a reduction to a problem from [Cor88]. The polynomial time solvability of this problem was proved by a reduction to the problem of packing by edges and triangles.
