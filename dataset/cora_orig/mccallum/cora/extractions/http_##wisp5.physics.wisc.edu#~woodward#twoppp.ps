Abstract: As part of its efforts to monitor and characterize periodic variations in the Io plasma torus, the Wisconsin Space Physics group acquired Fabry-Perot spectra of [S ii] 6716,6731 for a five-week period in 1988. Previous analysis (Woodward et al. 1994) showed periodicity, but, surprisingly, not at 10.2 hours|the persistent 3% sub-corotational period, often called System IV, reported in other long-term torus data sets. We show here that our 1988 data exhibit a quasiperiodic intensity variation at 10.2 hours, characterized by two distinct intensity enhancements which abruptly changed in relative magnitude during the observational run. We also present perpendicular ion temperature data from the same period, showing a periodic variation anticorrelated with intensity after the aforementioned abrupt change, but no significant periodicity beforehand. This non/anticorrelation appears to eliminate the possibility that a slowly moving magnetic field enhancement is responsible for the subcorotational periodicity. Considering these and other long-term data, we suggest that the various observed subcorotational features are not themselves responsible for the 3% subcorotational period, but rather are independent features modulated or otherwise affected by a permanent, global phenomenon

Reference-contexts: We regard it as the "typical" or "characteristic" temperature of the torus, or, more specifically, of the warm bright "ribbon" feature: images taken during the run show that there was very little [S ii] 6731 emission from the hot outer or (surprisingly) the cold inner torus <ref> (Woodward 1992) </ref>. - 4 - therefore, represents genuine periodic variation in the data.

Reference-contexts: We performed a careful periodicity analysis on our [S ii] 6731 intensity data, but found, to our surprise, that the data showed no periodic variation at 10.22 hours; instead, we found a statistically significant period of 10:14 0:06 h <ref> (Woodward et al. 1994) </ref>. During the course of analysis, we had noticed that the data could be described as organized in System IV if the first and last parts of the run were taken separately, but saw no reason so to separate the data. <p> The temperatures thus obtained are given in table 1; the intensities have been previously reported <ref> (Woodward et al. 1994) </ref>. <p> This analysis differs from that described in our earlier work <ref> (Woodward et al. 1994) </ref> in one respect: the determination of the "significance level" of the highest periodogram peak, i.e., the probability that the peak is not a result of random, normally-distributed noise. Previously, we found this probability from a formula due to Horne and Baliunas (1986). <p> and therefore excluded high-latitude emission, which makes up a larger fraction of the total emisson we see at higher temperatures than at lower.) The absence of an intensity/temperature 4 No significant System III period remains in this prewhitened periodogram, which is consistent with our earlier analysis of the full dataset <ref> (Woodward et al. 1994) </ref>. - 6 - anticorrelation in dataset A, however, shows that its dominant System IV feature is fundamentally different.
