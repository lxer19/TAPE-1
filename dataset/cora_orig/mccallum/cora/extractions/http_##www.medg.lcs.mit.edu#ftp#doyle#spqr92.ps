Abstract: Reset reproduction of two articles published in Computational Intelligence, Vol. 8, No. 2 (May 1992): Prolegomena to any future qualitative physics, pp. 187-209, and Epilegomenon, pp. 326-335.

Abstract We evaluate the success of the qualitative physics enterprise in automating expert reasoning about physical systems. The field has agreed, in essentials, upon a modeling language for dynamical systems, a representation for behavior, and an analysis method. The modeling language consists of generalized ordinary differential equations containing unspecified constants and monotonic functions; the behavioral representation decomposes the state space described by the equations into discrete cells; and the analysis method traces the transitory response using sign arithmetic and calculus. The field has developed several reasoners based on these choices over some fifteen years. We demonstrate that these reasoners exhibit severe limitations in comparison with experts and can analyze only a handful of simple systems. We trace the limitations to inappropriate assumptions about expert needs and methods. Experts ordinarily seek to determine asymptotic behavior rather than transient response, and use extensive mathematical knowledge and numerical analysis to derive this information. Standard mathematics provides complete qualitative understanding of many systems, including those addressed so far in qualitative physics. Preliminary evidence suggests that expert knowledge and reasoning methods can be automated directly, without restriction to the accepted language, representation and algorithm. We conclude that expert knowledge and methods provide the most promising basis for automating qualitative reasoning about physical systems.

Reference-contexts: estimate the number of successful SPQR analyses by surveying the 55 papers in the collection (Weld and de Kleer, 1990), which presents the state of the art through 1989. (We found no new analyses in the proceedings of AAAI-90.) We exclude examples presented without equations, such as the steam plant <ref> (Falkenhainer and Forbus, 1988) </ref>. Table 2 summarizes the results; the full list appears in Appendix A. Out of 37 examples, 30 reduce to three simple equations and 5 are purely algebraic, hence have no dynamics.

Reference-contexts: It can derive the asymptotic behavior only when every path through the transition graph leads to a fixed point (cf. <ref> (Iwasaki and Simon, 1986b) </ref>).

Some of 11 Sacks & Doyle the SPQR extensions can distinguish limit cycles from spiral fixed points, but only in a few special cases.

The transition graph does not specify whether the oscillations die out, remain constant, grow, or vary erratically <ref> (Kuipers, 1986) </ref>. The responsibility for this incompleteness rests with SPQR, since the equations imply that the oscillations die out. <p> Define an SPQR expression in x as M + (x), M (x), or any expression ff + fi, ff, fffi, 1=ff, M + (ff), or M (ff) in which ff and fi are SPQR expressions in x.

Reference-contexts: The others do not appear in the literature. The weakness of SPQR equations for analyzing dynamical systems does not mean that monotonic functions are useless. Monotonic relationships play an important role in analyzing some static situations, especially in deriving the stability of fixed points <ref> (Sacks, 1990b) </ref> and in decision analysis, where Wellman (1990) presents a useful, implemented theory of qualitative probabilistic networks based on monotonicity relationships. 3.3 Experts derive qualitative information by numerical analysis Experts make extensive, informed use of numerical analysis.

Reference-contexts: Periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic solutions yield simple loops, tori, and fractals. For example, Fig. 4 shows a phase diagram with two attracting limit cycles whose basins are separated by a repelling limit cycle. The corresponding equations model aeroelastic galloping of a square prism in a steady wind <ref> (Thompson and Stewart, 1986) </ref>. The diagram shows that the prism oscillates up and down and that the magnitude of oscillation jumps when the initial condition crosses the unstable limit cycle.

Reference-contexts: In the hands of experts, numerical analysis of typical ordinary differential equations takes only a few minutes on a scientific workstation. Although some tasks require greater effort, the main problem today is interpretation of the output, not computation speed (cf. <ref> (Truesdell, 1984) </ref>). 4 Mathematics and expert reasoning The preceding discussion shows that SPQR lacks the knowledge and methods that experts consider necessary for reasoning about physical systems, with the result that experts routinely understand many systems beyond the ken of SPQR. <p> not forget that the word "computer" always referred to a human up until the last few decades.) Even though experts now use computers to help extend their abilities to carry out numerical calculations, they must still rely on their underlying qualitative mathematical knowledge to know when to trust these calculations <ref> (Truesdell, 1984) </ref>. Let us consider some examples of practical concepts and methods from advanced mathematics. * One key question in design problems is whether some quantity (pressure in a boiler, say) remains bounded or can increase without limit, so that one can design the device to remain functional and safe.

Reference-contexts: In the hands of experts, numerical analysis of typical ordinary differential equations takes only a few minutes on a scientific workstation. Although some tasks require greater effort, the main problem today is interpretation of the output, not computation speed (cf. <ref> (Truesdell, 1984) </ref>). 4 Mathematics and expert reasoning The preceding discussion shows that SPQR lacks the knowledge and methods that experts consider necessary for reasoning about physical systems, with the result that experts routinely understand many systems beyond the ken of SPQR. <p> not forget that the word "computer" always referred to a human up until the last few decades.) Even though experts now use computers to help extend their abilities to carry out numerical calculations, they must still rely on their underlying qualitative mathematical knowledge to know when to trust these calculations <ref> (Truesdell, 1984) </ref>. Let us consider some examples of practical concepts and methods from advanced mathematics. * One key question in design problems is whether some quantity (pressure in a boiler, say) remains bounded or can increase without limit, so that one can design the device to remain functional and safe.
