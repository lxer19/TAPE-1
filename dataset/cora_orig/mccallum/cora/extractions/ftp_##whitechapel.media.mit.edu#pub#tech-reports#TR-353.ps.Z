Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 353 published in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence July 1997, vol 19, no 7, pp. 780-785 Abstract Pfinder is a real-time system for tracking people and interpreting thier behavior. It runs at 10Hz on a standard SGI Indy computer, and has performed reliably on thousands of people in many different physical locations. The system uses a multi-class statistical model of color and shape to obtain a 2-D representation of head and hands in a wide range of viewing conditions. Pfinder has been successfully used in a wide range of applications including wireless interfaces, video databases, and low-bandwidth coding.

Reference-contexts: The ability to find and follow people's head, hands, and body is therefore an important visual problem. To address this need we have developed a real-time system called Pfinder ("person finder") that substantially solves the problem for arbitrarily complex but single-person, fixed-camera situations. Use of image-to-image registration techniques <ref> [1, 10] </ref> as a preprocessing step allow Pfinder to function in the presence of camera rotation and zoom, but real-time performance cannot be achieved without special-purpose hardware.

Reference-contexts: However, in contrast to Pfinder these other systems all require accurate initialization and use local image features. Consequently, they have difficulty with occlusion and require massive computational resources. Functionally, our systems are perhaps most closely related to the work of Bichsel [3] and Baumberg and Hogg <ref> [2] </ref>. These systems segment the person from the background in real time using only a standard workstation. Their limitation is that they do not analyze the person's shape or internal features, but only the silhouette of the person.

Reference-contexts: Pfinder has been used as a real-time interface device for information, and performance spaces [18], video games [18], and a distributed virtual reality populated by artificial life <ref> [5] </ref>. It has also been used as a pre-processor for gesture recognition systems, including one that can recognize a forty-word subset of American Sign Language with near perfect accuracy [17]. <p> That is, K k is block-diagonal, with uncoupled spatial and spectral components. Each blob can also have a detailed representation of its shape and appearance, modeled as differences from the underlying blob statistics. The ability to efficiently compute compact representations of people's appearance is useful for low-bandwidth applications <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> To make a convincing 3-D world, the video must be placed correctly in the 3-D environment, that is, video of the person must be able to occlude, or be occluded by, the graphics <ref> [5] </ref>. The high level description of the user is also suitable for very-low bandwidth telepresence applications. On the remote end information about the user's head, hand, and feet position is used to drive an video avatar that represents the user in the scene [5]. <p> occlude, or be occluded by, the graphics <ref> [5] </ref>. The high level description of the user is also suitable for very-low bandwidth telepresence applications. On the remote end information about the user's head, hand, and feet position is used to drive an video avatar that represents the user in the scene [5]. One such avatar is illustrated in Fig. 3 (d). It is important to note that the avatars need not be an accurate representation of the user, or be human at all. 8 Hardware Pfinder is implemented on the SGI architecture using the VL (Video Library) interface.

Reference-contexts: person segmentation, tracking, and interpretation. 2 Background The notion of grouping atomic parts of a scene together to form blob-like entities based on proximity and visual appearance is a natural one, and has been of interest to visual scientists since the Gestalt psychologists studied grouping criteria early in this century <ref> [6] </ref>. In modern computer vision processing we seek to group image pixels together and to segment images based on visual coherence, but the features obtained from such efforts are usually taken to be the boundaries, or contours, of these regions rather than the regions themselves.

Reference-contexts: The central tracking and description algorithms, however, can equally well be applied to tracking vehicles or animals, and in fact we have done informal experiments in these areas. Pfinder is a descendant of the vision routines originally developed for the ALIVE system <ref> [9] </ref>, which performed person tracking but had no explicit model of the person and required a controlled background. <p> One such application is the Artificial Life IVE (ALIVE) system <ref> [9] </ref>. ALIVE utilizes Pfinder's support map polygon to define alpha values for video compositing (placing the user in a scene with some artificial life forms in real-time).
