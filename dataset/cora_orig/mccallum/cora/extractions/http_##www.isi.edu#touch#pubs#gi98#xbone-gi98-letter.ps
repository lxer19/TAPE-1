Title: Abstract: The X-Bone is a system for the rapid, automated deployment and management of overlay
Author: Joe Touch and Steve Hotz 
Affiliation: USC Information Sciences Institute  
Note: purposes. This document describes the architecture of the X-Bone. 1: Introduction FIGURE 1. Overlay networks  
Abstract: Overlay networks are increasingly becoming necessary for general infrastructure support, used for developing experimental protocols and for emulating dedicated networks over shared infrastructure, e.g., to support emergency services and disaster relief (Figure 1). They allow a set of shared resources to emulate several separate sets of dedicated resources, and allow new protocols and services to be developed in a safe and contained environment. Overlays also may provide reserved service, effectively a carpool lane for each overlays traffic. Additionally, overlay networks present a simplified network topology, so new protocols can be examined in controlled ways, without exposing the details of physical topology. The general use of overlays is hindered by the tedious and complicated nature of configuration and management. Current overlay networks are configured manually, often requiring out-of-band (i.e., telephone or e-mail) communication with human network managers. These managers are expected to oversee deployment, and avoid inefficiencies such as redundant traversals of the same links, or oversubscription of resources. Furthermore, there is no current framework in which to detect or avoid inter-overlay resource contention.

Reference-contexts: Overlay networks are composed of routing software installed at selected sites, connected by encapsulation tunnels [15] or direct links (Figure 1). Recent examples of overlays include the M-Bone for multicast IP [9] and the 6-Bone for IPv6 <ref> [1] </ref>. A single physical network can support multiple overlays, which can share both link and node resources. Today, deploying an overlay network is a manual process performed by human network managers. <p> The X-Bone also serves as a framework to coordinate and manage other new mechanisms (e.g. multiprotocol label switching [4]) within overlay networks. 6.1: Virtual networks The X-Bone is a direct descendant of the M-Bone [9] and its recent clone, the 6-Bone <ref> [1] </ref>. The M-Bone supports multicast IP by using routers that implement a superset of the IP routing algorithms used elsewhere in the Internet, and encapsulating otherwise incompatible multicast IP packet inside conventional IPv4 packets.

Reference-contexts: One of the earliest examples of overlay networking was the use of IP to support OSI/CNLP links [11]. In this system, the early Internet was used as a virtual network over which OSI network-level protocols were tested. MorphNet is similar to the X-Bone, although encompassing many levels of virtualization <ref> [2] </ref>. The X-Bone can be considered an IP version of MorphNet, but Mor-phNet focuses on the incorporation of heterogeneous systems of overlays at these different levels. The Metanet, proposed by Wroclawski at MIT, addresses the membership issues of the X-Bone [20].

Reference-contexts: Different applications on one host might each access different overlays, or a single application may access multiple overlays (Figure 6). Hosts on multiple overlays require multiple network addresses, which requires either multiple interfaces or multiple addresses for one interface. Hosts with multiple addresses are called multihomed <ref> [3] </ref>. Multihoming complicates packet addressing; packets sent out of the host must be stamped with a source address, and there is no convention for allowing applications to select that address.

Reference-contexts: The X-Bone can capitalize on, but does not rely on any of these developments to deploy immediately. The X-Bone also serves as a framework to coordinate and manage other new mechanisms (e.g. multiprotocol label switching <ref> [4] </ref>) within overlay networks. 6.1: Virtual networks The X-Bone is a direct descendant of the M-Bone [9] and its recent clone, the 6-Bone [1]. <p> Whereas VPNs suggest use of network address translators to deal with legacy address assignment, X-Bones inherent ability to rapidly choose and deploy virtual addresses affords an alternative solution to this problem. Multiprotocol Label Switching is an emerging IETF standard for simplified forwarding of layer 2 based on label swapping <ref> [4] </ref>. These mechanisms provide for more efficient tunneling of link-layer PDUs. The X-Bone will be able to manage and configure overlays using the MPLS interfaces.

Reference-contexts: In the X-Bone, application calls to gethostbyname (host1) can also be trapped in the OS or library, and replaced with geth-ostbynameenv (host1, environment (overlay_name)). The overlay can alternately be determined by state outside the application, such as user input or per-window environment variables <ref> [5] </ref>. The endpoint hosts require some combination of virtual addressing, multiple physical addresses, and policy routing 1 to allow them to participate in multiple overlays.

Reference-contexts: It provides manual configuration of a virtual net from a single remote site. The Supranet is the project most similar to the X-Bone; it is being developed in the CRATOS group at the Catholic University of Piacenza, Italy <ref> [6] </ref>. It focuses on optimizing the topology and resources of the virtual network to the physical network, and operates predominantly at the IP layer. In many ways, the X-Bone is the HTML to Supranets SGML; a simple subset designed to be rapidly deployed and evolved.

Reference-contexts: envisioned as the upper-level interface to a system that includes a variety of mechanisms, including Net-Script and NVN. 6.2: Other virtual networks Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) refer to the efforts to provide secure virtual private networks over public IP network infrastructure by combining tunneling mechanisms and mechanisms for IP security <ref> [8] </ref>. X-Bone will use the IP security framework in a similar manner to provide for secure overlay networks. X-Bone faces similar challenges with the use of private address spaces within the public infrastructure.

Reference-contexts: Xd will provide a similar tool to view the network topology of each overlay system. Xd also supports user monitoring and manipulation of the overlay (Figure 4). Similar topology display tools, e.g., GUILN <ref> [10] </ref>, are under development in the CAIRN project, but only for manual configuration, and for ATM networks. xd Manager Overlay router host Resource Daemon Resource Daemon link Resource Daemon Grab: All, N in K hops Reserve X Mbps of BW Select specific sites Select specific topology Select IP addresses ... <p> Turner and Mankin also propose virtual networks composed at the ATM level [18] for the CAIRN network, due to existing bandwidth allocation and enforcement at ATM switches.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the 6-Bone supports IPv6 by encapsulating IPv6 packets in IPv4, and providing IPv6 routing capability only at selected intermediate routers. One of the earliest examples of overlay networking was the use of IP to support OSI/CNLP links <ref> [11] </ref>. In this system, the early Internet was used as a virtual network over which OSI network-level protocols were tested. MorphNet is similar to the X-Bone, although encompassing many levels of virtualization [2].

Reference-contexts: Tunnels require the configuration of encapsulation and de-encapsulation mechanisms at each end of virtual link. Emerging tunnel management protocols for in-band control of the encapsulation parameters can be incorporated when available <ref> [12] </ref>. Hosts require configuration of addresses for virtual interfaces as well as environments within the host used to select the overlay (s) to which an application communicates.

Reference-contexts: The extent of the sharing is controlled by the API and configuration by the owner of each resource. In its initial deployment, the tool will be additionally constrained, e.g., to use only private IP addresses <ref> [13] </ref>, and to limit its access to router resources. The early systems will be deployed with a single, global encryption and authentication key, to avoid spoofing and intrusion. Initially, messages over both the single announcement channel and the per-overlay channels are authenticated via a single, global password.

Reference-contexts: Any application-level routing is, per se, an overlay on the conventional network-layer routing services. One recent example of application routing is distributed web cache proxy systems, such as ISIs LSAM <ref> [17] </ref> and UCLs CacheMesh [19]. In such systems, an client application contacts a primary proxy, which directs the request within a set of second-level proxies. This is equivalent to application-level routing, and acts as an overlay on the network-layer routing provided by TCP/IP and IP addresses of the proxies.
