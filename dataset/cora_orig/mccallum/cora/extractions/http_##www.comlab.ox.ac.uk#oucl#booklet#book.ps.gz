Reference-contexts: In this context correct means conforming to the IEEE Standard 754, and a big first step was to decide exactly what the specification required. The IEEE document is partly reliant on the meaning of natural language requirements; Geoff Barrett's recasting of the Standard into the Z specification language <ref> [1] </ref> is unambiguous and serves as the touchstone for the correctness of the T800 FPU. The microcode of the T800 FPU was documented in a restricted subset of occam.

Reference-contexts: The microcode of the T800 FPU was documented in a restricted subset of occam. Using the occam transformation system developed in Oxford <ref> [2] </ref>, David Shepherd demonstrated that this code was equivalent to a more naturally expressed occam program which had been shown to meet the Z specification.

Reference-contexts: The transformation system builds on the simple semantics of occam, as expressed by Bill Roscoe and Tony Hoare in <ref> [3] </ref>, allowing essentially mechanical proof that two programs like the specification of the FPU and the implementing microcode have the same effect. There is a very readable non-technical summary of this work in an article in New Scientist [4].
