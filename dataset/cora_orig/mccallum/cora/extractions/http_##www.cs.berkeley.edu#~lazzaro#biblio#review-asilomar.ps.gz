Reference-contexts: Likewise, several researchers over the previous decade have implemented computational models of biological auditory processing, with the goal of incorporating these models into a speech recognition system [9] <ref> [1] </ref>. These projects have shown the promise of the biological approach, sometimes showing clear performance advantages over traditional methods [15]. However, these algorithms are very computationally costly if run on serial digital computers. <p> These theorists note that the mean firing rate of most auditory fibers are saturated for loud sounds, leaving a small number of fibers to encode the sound. This fact is counterintuitive with practical experience and psychophysical experiments: louder sounds are easier to locate and understand than softer sounds <ref> [1] </ref>. These theorists have developed models of auditory processing that do not require a large dynamic range of mean-rate encoding. These models have inspired most of the integrated circuits that use silicon cochleas as components. <p> Another silicon system generates and displays a two-dimensional auto-correlation function, using CCD technology [12]. Other auditory algorithms use temporal correlation to compute new one-dimensional representations of audition. Several algorithms use temporal correlation for spectral enhancement, transforming the nonlinear frequency representation of Figure 1 into an amplitude-independent spectral representation <ref> [1] </ref>. A spectral enhancement algorithm of this nature has been recently implemented in analog VLSI [6]. Acknowledgements Thanks to R. Duda for an invitation to present this paper at Asilomar. Thanks to K.

The original publications of many of these systems are in the literature of neural networks and circuit design. <p> The resonant frequencies of the output taps are exponentially spaced over several orders of magnitude. The delay through the silicon cochleas increases exponentially down the structure; the cascade structure enforces a monotonic increase of filter delay. This cochlea circuit is used in a complete model of the auditory periphery <ref> [3] </ref>. In this chip, each silicon cochlea output connects to a circuit that models the signal processing that occurs during inner hair cell transduction. The output from this circuit is a unidirectional current; this output connects to a circuit that models spike generation of the spiral ganglion cells. <p> Figure 1 shows a frequency-domain characterization of silicon auditory-nerve fiber. This data was taken by presenting sinusoidal signals at different frequencies and amplitudes as input, and noting the average firing rate from a spiking output <ref> [3] </ref>. Note that the filter bandwidth asymmetrically increases with increasing amplitude; the high-frequency filter cutoff remains fairly stationary, but the low-frequency filter cutoff shifts dramatically downward.

Reference-contexts: The cochlea acts as a transducer, converting acoustic energy into the first neural representation of audition. The auditory nerve carries this representation to the brainstem; the nerve contains approximately 50,000 fibers. <ref> [16] </ref> includes a review of the structure and function of the cochlea. Sound processing begins in the outer and middle ear, where the resonant properties of the ear canal and outer ear gently shape the spectrum of the sound signal. <p> Computing the running cross-correlation function of the left and right cochlear representations, for many linearly-spaced correlation time delays, produces a two-dimensional correlation representation that encodes auditory localization information <ref> [16] </ref>. The cross-correlation of two cochlear representations, without any explicit time delays, also produces a two-dimensional representation that encodes auditory localization information [17]; this representation uses the implicit time delay of traveling-wave propagation on the basilar membrane of each cochlea.
