Abstract: This paper discusses a fundamental problem in text generation: how to select the content to communicate and how to present it in a coherent text. In this research, we set out to determine automatically the semantic content and the rhetorical structure of French instructional texts. To do so, we performed a corpus analysis in order to capture natural linguistic phenomena. From the corpus analysis we determined 9 semantic carriers typically communicated in instructional texts and 7 rhetorical relations used to present them. From this analysis, we then developed 2 sets of heuristics: content heuristics that determine what semantic carriers should be communicated in the text and presentation heuristics that determine how the semantic carriers should be organized rhetorically in order to create a coherent and natural text. These heuristics are based on 5 types of constraints: conceptual, semantic, rhetorical, pragmatic and intentional constraints. In order to verify these heuristics, we developed the spin system which performs all steps of text generation but focuses on the determination of the content and the rhetorical structures.

Reference-contexts: The problem is amplified by two phenomena: the lack of a canonical 30 form for the input and sometimes the output of a generation system and the difficulty to define the set of "correct" output <ref> [Walker, 1989, Bates et al., 1994] </ref>. We do not believe that a word-for-word comparison of a language generation theory's output and a "natural" text is an appropriate evaluation method.

Reference-contexts: To achieve this, it constructs a conceptual representation of the task using a nonlinear AI planner and a library of schemas of operators [Sacerdoti, 1977]. This technique is typically used in the generation of instructional texts (see for example, [Mellish, 1988], <ref> [Dale, 1992] </ref>, [Paris and Vander Linden, 1996a]) because the structure of the resulting plans is hierarchical, similarly to the structure of the text. The result of this step is a tree-like structure of operator schemas necessary to achieve the top-level request. <p> to validate our heuristics, we have thus followed two other more popular evaluation methods: a comparison with other instruction-generation systems and a global qualitative comparison of the generated texts with their "natural" counterparts. 6.1 Comparison with previous work Two previous research projects have built instructional text generators: [Mellish, 1988] and <ref> [Dale, 1992] </ref>'s epicure. We have thus taken their output texts and managed to reproduce them through spin.

Reference-contexts: Here, the outcome is promoted to the nucleus position of relation; while to observe is demoted to the satellite position. <ref> [Delin et al., 1994] </ref> note that in English, an outcome can be presented by a sequence, but this phenomenon has not been found in our French corpus.

Reference-contexts: This distinction between semantic and rhetoric concerns is much more important for us than the distinction between their processes, for example Moore and Paris [Moore and Paris, 1993] also separate these concerns by allowing both semantic and rhetorical operations in their planners. In <ref> [Delin et al., 1993] </ref>, it has been demonstrated that in multilingual instructions, the same information can be conveyed using different rhetorical structures depending on the language of communication. <p> Warnings and safety issues, that are required to be communicated in North-American instructions, may seem frivolous in another country where the culture and legislation is different. The number of preventions, for example, will therefore be influence by this factor. As to the structure of the texts, <ref> [Delin et al., 1993] </ref> have already noted that in multilingual instructions, the same content may be presented by different rhetorical means according to the language of communication. These very interesting issues remain to be investigated. Acknowledgment The work presented here is based on the first author's Ph.D. thesis.

Reference-contexts: These translations are almost always acceptable English instructions. On the other hand, other research have shown preferences in rhetorical relations according to the language studied <ref> [Delin et al., 1996] </ref>. Through the corpus analysis, we identified 9 meanings (which we call semantic carriers) and 7 rhetorical relations that are used to present them. Semantic carriers and rhetorical relations make up the larger part of instructional texts. <p> But some carriers refer to relations whose nucleus and satellite will be determined at the rhetorical level when the most appropriate relation is chosen. To define the semantic carriers, we have been inspired by the semantic relations of type generation, instance generation and enablement of [Goldman, 1970]. <ref> [Delin et al., 1996] </ref> show how these relations can be used as the basis for the generation of multilingual instructional texts. These relations, however, do not cover the range of semantic entities found in instructional texts; thus, we have developed more specific entities particular to this discourse genre.

Reference-contexts: MC-2 sequence is used if: semantic constraint: A material condition M C is to be communicated, and M C is not related to the operation it constrains by an enablement <ref> [Di Eugenio, 1993] </ref>. pragmatic constraint: M C is a modifiable condition. This is the case in (20). This phenomenon seems to apply both in French and in English. In fact, Vander Linden notes that conditions that specify a modifiable state are presented by a sequence [Vander Linden, 1993].

Reference-contexts: Tourner cette touche a droite et a gauche pour minimiser les parasites.

These mappings are an important problem that should be dealt within a text generator.

Reference-contexts: But some carriers refer to relations whose nucleus and satellite will be determined at the rhetorical level when the most appropriate relation is chosen. To define the semantic carriers, we have been inspired by the semantic relations of type generation, instance generation and enablement of <ref> [Goldman, 1970] </ref>. [Delin et al., 1996] show how these relations can be used as the basis for the generation of multilingual instructional texts. These relations, however, do not cover the range of semantic entities found in instructional texts; thus, we have developed more specific entities particular to this discourse genre. <p> For example, a required operation is defined as a semantic element that refers to a procedural aspect of the text, specifies an operation rather than a state, is mandatory, is performed individually and not in parallel with another operation, is not involved in an instance generation relation (as defined by <ref> [Goldman, 1970] </ref>) and refers to a positive operation (eg. Do A, rather than Don't do A). These criteria are generally sufficient to identify a semantic carrier, however, in some cases the context or knowledge of the reader is not sufficient to verify if a criterion is satisfied or not.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, our corpus analysis revealed a strong correlation between the textual genre (execution, hybrid or comprehension texts) and the grammatical form of rethorical relations; thus confirming <ref> [Hartley and Paris, 1996] </ref>'s results. Figure 10 shows the output of the grammatical structurer. The lexico-morphological selector takes over the grammatical structure and selects the lexemes to be used. The words are chosen (in the current implementation, a one-to-one correspondence exists between concepts and words) and declined.

Reference-contexts: More generally, many researchers have argued that within a unilingual environment the mapping between the semantic and the rhetorical levels is many-to-many <ref> [Moore and Pollack, 1992, Korelsky and Kittredge, 1993] </ref>. It thus becomes necessary to have linguistically motivated guidelines on how to organize a text's content; that is, how to map a semantic representation onto the most appropriate rhetorical structure.

Reference-contexts: If the procedure had a less precise goal (e.g. using a remote control) then each procedure was counted separately. Table 1 lists the texts of the corpus along with some textual, conceptual, lexical and typographical characteristics. References to the original texts are given in <ref> [Kosseim, 1995] </ref>. The corpus was divided into 3 classes according to the communicative goal of the texts. Execution texts are characterized by their simplicity and are aimed at an immediate execution. <p> For example, execution texts contain many less attributes but more required operations than comprehension texts. These results are not surprising, considering that an execution text tells what to do; while an comprehension text explains. More detail about the semantic analysis of our corpus can be found in <ref> [Kosseim, 1995] </ref>. Once a semantic element has been chosen, it may be expressed from a given point of view, but the mapping between these two levels is not direct as we showed in section 1. <p> The choice between a purpose, a result and a means does not seem to depend on cooccurrences of rhetorical relations but on whether the outcomes are desirable or not. <ref> [Kosseim, 1995] </ref> describe many examples that can be categorized by the following heuristics: OU-1 A result is always used if semantic constraint: An outcome OU is to be communicated. pragmatic constraint: OU specifies the reaction of a device. <p> We have thus taken their output texts and managed to reproduce them through spin. A comparison of both texts, presented in detail in <ref> [Kosseim, 1995] </ref>, shows that spin uses better content selection heuristics than that of Mellish and that it can generate comparable output to the one produced by Epicure in the domain of cooking recipes although it was not optimized for this application. <p> Recall that in the case of material conditions that pertain to the nature of a device, MC-3 suggests the use of a purpose or a -condition, but has no preference. spin thus picked randomly the relation of c-condition, which in our opinion sound very natural. <ref> [Kosseim, 1995] </ref> has analyzed two other texts that show that the output of spin is comparable to the ones found in the current instruction booklets. 33 6.3 Global evaluation of spin The most important contribution of spin is the explicit separation of two important questions in textual planning.

Reference-contexts: Instructional texts are characterized by stereotypical relations between parts of the text.

Semantic carriers identify the meaning of textual expressions 4 . They are called carriers because they are elements of meaning that are directly mapped onto the satellite of a RST relation <ref> [Mann and Thompson, 1988] </ref>. But some carriers refer to relations whose nucleus and satellite will be determined at the rhetorical level when the most appropriate relation is chosen.

Reference-contexts: Following <ref> [Mellish, 1988] </ref>, our aim is the define general rules for the generation of instructions in all domains, then particular rules for adapting the text to a specific domain and reader.

In drafter, the text planner determines the content to be included in the text as well as its rhetorical structure through <ref> [Moore and Paris, 1993] </ref>'s text planner. Similarly to spin's, drafter's text planner allows the same conceptual information to be presented through different rhetorical relations; but in addition drafter determines its choice according to the language of communication.

For Vander Linden, the most important RST relations are temporal sequence, precondition which we call c-condition, purpose, result and concurrence.

For Vander Linden, the most important RST relations are temporal sequence, precondition which we call c-condition, purpose, result and concurrence. <p> As defined by <ref> [Vander Linden, 1993] </ref>, a condition is modifiable if the agent must check it or perform an operation so that it becomes true. <p> This is the case in (20). This phenomenon seems to apply both in French and in English. In fact, Vander Linden notes that conditions that specify a modifiable state are presented by a sequence <ref> [Vander Linden, 1993] </ref>. He calls this phenomenon a rhetorical promotion. Indeed, what is considered a condition on an operation at the semantic level is promoted to a full-fledge agent-action at the rhetorical level. Instead of being presented as the satellite of a relation, it becomes a nucleus. <p> In English, the distinction is more obvious as a means is realized by a gerund; while the concurrency is realized without the preposition by but with a preposition like while, meanwhile, . . . <ref> [Vander Linden, 1993] </ref>. 4.2.7 Options Options can be presented in the text by: * A purpose (79 %): 23 (28) Tirer la roue et le pneu; pour vous aider , poussez fermement le flanc du pneu avec votre pied. <p> This process constructs an RST-like text representation. Figure 8 shows an example of semantic structure of the vcr text. Once the list of rhetorical relations selected, it must be reordered to take into account some cooccurrence constraints and to position the satellites in relation with their nucleus. Vander Linden <ref> [Vander Linden, 1993] </ref> has thoroughly studied this aspect in English and in our corpus, the relative position of the elements of a rhetoric relation seem to follow the same rules. This step finally adds appropriate punctuation signs between relations: each nucleus is presented in a single sentence.

Reference-contexts: The problem is amplified by two phenomena: the lack of a canonical 30 form for the input and sometimes the output of a generation system and the difficulty to define the set of "correct" output <ref> [Walker, 1989, Bates et al., 1994] </ref>. We do not believe that a word-for-word comparison of a language generation theory's output and a "natural" text is an appropriate evaluation method.
