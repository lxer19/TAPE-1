Abstract: In this paper we relate expressiveness of !-automata to their complexity. Expressiveness is related to the different subclasses of the !-regular languages that are accepted by automata that arise by restrictions on the acceptance conditions used. For example, different subclasses of the !-regular languages arise from identifying the !-languages with different classes and levels in the Borel hierarchy. Within the class of !-regular languages, Wagner and Kaminski identified a strict hierarchy of languages induced by restricting the number of pairs allowed in a deterministic Rabin automaton (DRA). Complexity relates to the smallest size automaton required to realize an !-regular language. Safra shows that there are !-regular languages for which deterministic Streett automata (DSA) are exponentially smaller than nondeterministic Buchi automata; in contrast, we show that for every DSA or DRA whose language is in class G ffi , there exists a DBA of size linear in the original automaton. We show in particular that the language of a DRA is in class G ffi if and only if the language can be realized as a DBA on the same transition structure as the DRA. We present a simple construction to transform a DRA with h pairs and n states to an equivalent DRA with O(n:h k ) states and k pairs (i.e. DR(n; h) ! DR(n:h k ; k)), where k is the Rabin Index (RI) of the language|the minimum number of pairs required to realize the language as a DRA. We also present a construction to translate a DSA into a minimum-pair DRA, achieving a transformation DS(n; h) ! DR(n:h k ; r), where k is the Streett index (SI), and r the RI of the language. We prove that it is NP-hard to determine the RI (SI) of a language specified by a DRA (DSA). However, for a DRA (DSA) with h pairs, determining whether the RI (SI) is h, or any constant c, is in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: It follows that for the class of languages realizable by DRA with a constant number of pairs (i.e. within a constant level in the Wagner/Kaminski hierarchy), the minimum pair automaton is polynomially related in size to any arbitrary equivalent deterministic automaton in this class. In <ref> [1] </ref> is an algorithm to yield a minimum-pair DRA with O (n h 4 2h 2 ) number of states|significantly worse than ours.

Reference-contexts: We restrict our attention to complete deterministic automata. Expressiveness is related to topological and structural properties of the languages. In the Cantor Topology [12], the !-regular languages have been identified with certain levels in the Borel hierarchy|wherein, the Safety languages <ref> [2, 12] </ref> correspond to the class F of closed sets, the !-regular languages in the class G ffi are exactly those accepted by DBA, and all the !-regular languages are contained within the class G ffi " F ffi [12, 13].

Reference-contexts: It is known that the language-emptiness problem for Buchi and Rabin automata is logspace complete for NLOGSPACE [12]. Also quadratic time algorithms are known for checking emptiness of Streett automata <ref> [3] </ref>. We address the complexity of the emptiness problem for automata with Boolean formulae. Theorem 9. For A = hT; i, where is a PBF, checking L (A) = ; is logspace complete for NLOGSPACE. <p> It can be shown that if is a PBF, the language is in G ffi . In contrast, the emptiness problem for automata with negative Boolean formulae is NP-complete (the proof is similar to that of Theorem 4.7 in <ref> [3] </ref> and is omitted for space). Theorem 10. For A = hT; i where is a NBF, checking L (A) = ; is NP-complete. 2.1 The Wagner/Kaminski Hierarchy From McNaughton's theorem [12], it follows that every !-regular language is recognized by a deterministic Muller automaton (DMA). <p> If the depth of the recursion is c, the automaton A 3 will have O (n:h c ) states and h + c pairs, and since RA language-emptiness is in polynomial time <ref> [3] </ref>, a polynomial time algorithm follows. The language of a DSA has SI h if there exists a negative chain of length h.

Reference-contexts: Within the class of !-regular languages, there is an infinite hierarchy of languages induced by restricting the number of pairs allowed in a DRA. Wagner [13] and independently Kaminski <ref> [5] </ref> showed that this hierarchy is strict, i.e. for every n there exists a language that cannot be realized by a DRA with fewer than n pairs. The minimum number of pairs required to realize a language as a DRA is called the Rabin index (RI) of the language. <p> Using this it can be shown that an !-regular language L = [ h i=1 (D i "C i ) where D i 2 G ffi and C i 2 F , are !-regular and F = G ffi . Wagner [13] and Kaminski <ref> [5] </ref> showed that: Lemma 11. L = [ h i=1 (D i " C i ),D i 2 G ffi , C i 2 F , L is accepted by a DRA with h pairs Definition 12. <p> For every !-regular language L, the least k such that L 2 Rn (k) is called the Rabin Index (RI) of the language. Clearly Rn (k 1) Rn (k). Wagner [13] and Kaminski <ref> [5] </ref> proved that: Theorem 13. For each k 2, Rn (k 1) Rn (k), i.e. Rn (k) n Rn (k 1) is non-empty. Wagner and Kaminski also gave a structural characterization of languages in Rn (k) by extending Landweber's characterization of DBA.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, there exists DSA whose languages lie in G ffi but cannot be realized as DBA on the same transition structure <ref> [6] </ref>; nevertheless we show that for every DSA whose language is in G ffi there exists a DBA whose size is linear in the size of the original DSA. We offer a simple construction to translate a DRA with h pairs to a DRA with a minimum number of pairs. <p> Basically, L (A 0 ) = L (A) [ L (hT; Si), where hT; Si is the DBA on T with final state set S. Rabin automata We defined the notion of a final state in Section 2. We showed in <ref> [6] </ref> how to determine in polynomial time if a state in a RA is final. Lemma 16. Given a DRA A, an accepting SCS C is superset closed if and only if C " F 6= ;, where F is the set of final states of the DRA. Proof.

Reference-contexts: However, for a DRA (DSA) with h pairs, determining whether the RI (SI) is h, or c, for any constant c, is in polynomial time. Our resolution of the complexity of determining the R/S Index of a language settles an open problem posed by Manna and Pnueli in <ref> [8] </ref> (page 383). Finally, we also provide a method for obtaining results similar to Wagner and Kaminski for other subclasses of !-regular languages. In particular, we show that the star-free !-regular sets also form an infinite hierarchy within the Wag-ner/Kaminski hierarchy. Section 2 presents our notation. <p> Alternately, the acceptance conditions can be specified by using a temporal logic such as Propositional Linear Temporal Logic, PLTL <ref> [8] </ref>. PLTL is expressively equivalent to the star-free !-regular sets. For example, the condition that q i is visited infinitely often could be stated with the formula = 23q i . We define a run r to be accepting provided r j= and L (A) = fjr j= g. <p> Lemma 30. If A = hT; L Q i and L Q is !-regular, then L (A) is !-regular. Lemma 31. If A= hT; L (F )i and L (F ) 2 Rn (n), then L (A) 2 Rn (n). We use these results to discuss wherePLTL <ref> [8] </ref> lies in the Wagner/Kaminski hierarchy. For a PLTL formula , we define L ( ) = fj j= g. Theorem 32. For each n, there is a PLTL formula such that L ( ) 2 Rn (n) n Rn (n 1). Proof.
