Abstract: This paper explores the relative utility of varying causal commitment in case-based planning. Earlier work has found that the strategy of least commitment in plan step ordering which is adopted by partial-order planners greatly improves a planner's ability to adapt a previous planning episode to a new problem-solving situation. This leads to the question as to whether strong causal commitment is also detrimental to case-based performance. In this paper we test planners which vary in their commitment to causal structure. We find that, in a complex realistic domain, delaying causal commitment does not in general improve generative planning performance but does improve case-based planning.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the flexible plan representations produced by partial-order planners provide a greater ability to adapt a previous planning episode to a new problem-solving situation. Der-SNLP (Derivational Systematic Nonlinear Planner) is a case-based planner based within SNLP <ref> [ 1; 18 ] </ref> . Unlike state-space total-order planners, SNLP's stored plans do not contain arbitrary inter-operator orderings which may cause a previous plan to fail in a new problem-solving context. <p> Section 5 summarizes the contributions of this paper and discusses some related work. 2 Tradeoffs of Strong Causal Commitment in CBP Earlier work has demonstrated that strong causal commitment can have varying effect on generative planning depending on the domain <ref> [ 13; 1; 23; 24 ] </ref> In particular, Veloso and Blythe [ 23 ] show that strong commitment to causal links can give SNLP a disadvantage over state-space planners. For example, consider the link repeat domain described in [ 23 ] and shown in Figure 4. <p> Since eager derivation replay does not alter the underlying planning strategy, but merely provides search control, the planner in replay mode inherits all of the properties of the underlying planner. For example, when based within SNLP, it is is complete, sound and systematic <ref> [ 18; 1 ] </ref> . Moreover, eager derivation replay may be implemented within a number of planning strategies. The basic framework remains unchanged. Only the content of the planning decisions contained in the derivation trace varies with the planner.

Reference-contexts: However, Der-SNLP was able to improve on this performance by slightly altering its replay strategy. So far we have tested commitment strategies of planners which either commit to particular plan constraints including plan steps, step orderings, or causal links or delay this commitment. Some planners such as GRAPH-PLAN <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> , SATPLAN [ 17; 16 ] , DESCARTES [ 10; 9 ] and UCPOP-D [ 15 ] avoid commitment to specific plan constraints by representing plans as disjunctions over these constraints.

Reference-contexts: Although a least commitment strategy as to step ordering is common to partial-order planners, including NOAH [ 20 ] , NONLIN [ 21 ] , SIPE [ 25 ] , UA [ 19 ] , and TWEAK <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> , these planners differ from SNLP on their level of commitment to causal structure. For example, UA [ 19 ] and TWEAK [ 3 ] do not form and protect specific causal links. <p> partial-order planners, including NOAH [ 20 ] , NONLIN [ 21 ] , SIPE [ 25 ] , UA [ 19 ] , and TWEAK <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> , these planners differ from SNLP on their level of commitment to causal structure. For example, UA [ 19 ] and TWEAK [ 3 ] do not form and protect specific causal links. Since causal links may have to be violated in a changing context, when a new problem contains extra goals, this leads to the question of whether relaxing commitment to causal links improves case-based performance. <p> When all goals have been achieved, it performs a solution extraction similar to DerSNLP+Soln. We call this planner DerTWEAK due to its underlying similarity to Chapman's TWEAK <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> . Other than the differences mentioned above, the planners have key routines in common (such as unification and operator selection) but vary on the type of planning decisions. For example, DerSNLP, DerNSNLP and Der-SNLP+Soln make two types of decisions: establishment and threat resolution.

Large scale domains also exhibit multiple linking opportunities. For example, the logistics transportation domain contains many options as to which plane and which route to take in transporting packages. <p> We tested the replay performance of planners which vary in their commitment to causal structure.

This domain is known to be difficult for causal link planners <ref> [ 23 ] </ref> . The result that DerSNLP did not improve significantly with replay in this domain is not surprising given that its strong commitments to causal links do not generalize between randomly-generated problems.
