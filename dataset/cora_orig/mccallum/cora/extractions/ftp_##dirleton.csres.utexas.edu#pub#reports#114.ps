Reference-contexts: This is merely a convention programs may be written in whatever typeface is desired and available. 2.10 Annotations -- New 1 Annotations allow the user to 2 define functions, constants and theorems in the ACL2 logic <ref> [Kaufmann 94] </ref>, 3 assert logical specifications for AVA functions, procedures, types, and statements, and 4 state axioms and purported theorems to be used in the analysis of programs. <p> The rules of 13.14, ``Freezing Rules'', prevent , at compile time, premature uses of other entities such as private types and deferred constants. 3.12 Annotation Declarations -- New 1Annotations allow the user to 2 define functions, constants and theorems in the ACL2 logic <ref> [Kaufmann 94] </ref>, 3 assert logical specifications for AVA functions, procedures, objects, and statements, 4 and state axioms and purported theorems to be used in the analysis of programs. 5One difficulty that the user may encounter is that expressions in ACL2 and AVA have different semantics.

Reference-contexts: The syntax was originally more similar to that of ANNA <ref> [Luckham 90] </ref>. As we faced the issue of providing a precise semantics for annotations in ACL2 they have evolved away from ANNA.
