Abstract: We present an architecture for a distributed tool service which operates over HTTP, the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web. This allows unmodified Web browsers to request tool executions from the server as well as making integration with existing systems easier. We describe Rivendell, a prototype implementation of the architecture described. This paper is based on work sponsored in part by Advanced Research Project Agency under [D]ARPA Order B128 monitored by Air Force Rome Lab F30602-94-C-0197. The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of the US government, DARPA or the Air Force.

Reference-contexts: such a way that a Scenario with an "Arch" type of "Intel/Windows" causes Rivendell to start a WinDD client running the Windows tool on behalf of the user. 13 crash, etc), the OzWeb server defaults to its original method of running tools directly for the user. 6 Related Work WebMake <ref> [1] </ref> uses a specialized set of Web documents, along with a modified World Wide Web browser to allow software development via HTTP. External tools can be invoked based on context transmitted from this specially modified client.

Reference-contexts: The HTTP specification provides methods for a client to request a document (GET) and send data (PUT) to a server. The documents are specified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators <ref> [2] </ref>) which are really just strings that request something from the HTTP server. The object requested may be an document or an image (as when a Web browser sends a request to an HTTP website server), or it may be a request for some service.

Reference-contexts: We can employ the World Wide Web's standard mechanism for capability augmentation: a new MIME type and MIME helper application. Every response from an HTTP server is tagged with a type tag, known as a MIME <ref> [3] </ref> type. Figure 3 shows an example response and its associated MIME type field. Every World Wide Web browser can be configured to start what is known as a Helper Application when it receives data with a certain MIME type.

OzWeb is an extended Web server which provides workflow, transaction management, object oriented data modeling and concurrency controls on top of distributed documents.

Reference-contexts: HTTP is chosen because it is a simple TCP/IP based request-response protocol, making it easy to "graft" onto existing systems (possibly using toolkits like libWWW <ref> [6] </ref> from the World Wide Web Consortium or ASHeS [12], the Application Specific HTTP Services toolkit from our research group). The HTTP specification provides methods for a client to request a document (GET) and send data (PUT) to a server.

Reference-contexts: The World Wide Web provides a unique platform for distributed tool services. The HTTP protocol <ref> [7] </ref>, the underlying protocol of the WWW, includes facilities which allow a client to request something from a server (the HTTP GET method). This request format can be generalized to allow a client to request a tool from a tool server "masquerading" as a Web server.

Reference-contexts: A tool server which connected to SoftBench would make it possible to more easily add non SoftBench-aware tools to the development system. Matchmaker <ref> [9] </ref> is a distributed computing interface specification language which allows a programmer to define RPC interfaces between remote processes. A multi-targeted compiler then generates C, Pascal, Lisp, or Ada code which implements the interfaces defined.

Reference-contexts: This requires either source code availability (to modify the tool to understand Field messages) or an existing API through which the capability can be added. There is little support for integrating other types of tools. Sun's ToolTalk <ref> [10] </ref> protocol allows applications from differing vendors to share information via a message bus type architecture. ToolTalk could conceivably be employed as another communication option via which users could request tools from a tool server.

Reference-contexts: The existing system must be able to connect to the tool server and request tools on behalf of the system's users, without their intervention. An HTTP, CORBA <ref> [13] </ref>, or RPC style interface would make integration easier.

Reference-contexts: Matchmaker [9] is a distributed computing interface specification language which allows a programmer to define RPC interfaces between remote processes. A multi-targeted compiler then generates C, Pascal, Lisp, or Ada code which implements the interfaces defined. Ockerbloom <ref> [14] </ref> proposes an alternative to MIME types, called Typed Object Model (TOM), that could conceivably be employed instead of a MIME extension to incorporate a Personal Tool Server into our architecture.

Reference-contexts: External tools can be invoked based on context transmitted from this specially modified client. Field <ref> [15] </ref> uses a message bus to incorporate tools into an integrated software development architecture. This requires either source code availability (to modify the tool to understand Field messages) or an existing API through which the capability can be added.

Reference-contexts: MTP, a previous tool execution effort in our lab, supports the execution of groupware and other multiuser tools as well as floor passing among multiple users of single-user tools using a utility such as XMove <ref> [16] </ref>. The latter can be used, for instance, to share an inherently single-user tool, such as the Emacs editor, among multiple users (taking turns). This functionality would be a useful addition to Rivendell.

Reference-contexts: Bob would not need to know that his request had been forwarded, it would be the responsibility of the tool server on nyserv to do this transparently. Rivendell has also been integrated with the WinDD software from Tektronix <ref> [17] </ref>. WinDD allows a user sitting at a UNIX workstation to remotely execute tools on a Windows NT Server machine, handling all display redirection on behalf of the user. WinDD employs special software, running on the UNIX workstation, to contact the Windows NT server.

Reference-contexts: ToolTalk could conceivably be employed as another communication option via which users could request tools from a tool server. Integration with Sun development tools would be made easier, since they support the integration of third-party software via the ToolTalk protocol. HP's SoftBench <ref> [18] </ref> framework, a tool-integration platform that provides an open, common set of communication and user interface services to all tools integrated with the SoftBench environment would also be a useful platform with which to integrate a tool services component.

Reference-contexts: Once this has been accomplished, Rivendell performs an HTTP PUT to upload into the foreign server the list of activities and scenarios it has been configured to know about. the configuration information from MTP <ref> [19] </ref>, a previous tool execution effort in our lab, which allowed for (among other things) specifying particular hosts where tools had to run. The MTP effort also considered shared groupware tools, one of the extensions we hope to make to Rivendell during our future work on the system.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of extensions we'd like to make to Rivendell. We'd like to integrate it with LDAP <ref> [20] </ref>, the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, an industry standard that allows for simple queries to be made to X.500 compliant directory servers.
