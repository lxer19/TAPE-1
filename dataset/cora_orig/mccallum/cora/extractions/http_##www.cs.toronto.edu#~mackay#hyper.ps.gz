Abstract: In discussions of coarse coding, previous results have suggested that the larger the overlap between receptive fields is made, the sharper the achievable hyperacuity becomes. This note moderates this view by giving for an array of noisy analog receptors the scaling laws for the best achievable hyperacuity as a function of increasing receptive field size.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The benefits and defects of coarse coding have been described in <ref> [1, Chapter 3] </ref>. The use of an array of receptors with large overlapping receptive fields makes it possible to achieve hyperacuity, that is, to achieve resolution sharper than the inter-receptor distance. <p> However this work and other publications, e.g. [2] 1 , have suggested that it is generally true that the larger the size of the receptive fields is made, the sharper the achievable hyperacuity becomes. This statement is correct for the binary noise-free neurons considered in <ref> [1] </ref>, but this note will show that it is not generally true for analog neurons with intrinsic noise. 2 Assumptions The same starting point and notation will be used as in [1]. <p> This statement is correct for the binary noise-free neurons considered in <ref> [1] </ref>, but this note will show that it is not generally true for analog neurons with intrinsic noise. 2 Assumptions The same starting point and notation will be used as in [1]. Consider an array of receptors having identical spherically symmetric receptive fields of characteristic radius r; the centres of these receptive fields are uniformly distributed with density n in a k-dimensional input space. <p> response of a single receptor is proportional to receptive field width r. a) A A A A A A - 6 y max b) j j j j j jQ j j j j j j Q j j j j j jQ - 6 y max The difference from <ref> [1] </ref> is that each receptor has an analog response with added noise. <p> receptor l with field centred on x l to a stimulus at x S is y l (x S ) = y max f jx S x l j j where N is additive noise, for example, gaussian with standard deviation , and f is a monotonic function with range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. I will assume that the amplitude of the noise is small compared with the dynamic range y max of the neuron, i.e. y max AE . <p> These combine to give oe = s= p 2 This oe Analog scales differently with increasing r and n from the oe Binary for binary noise-free neurons <ref> [1] </ref>: oe Binary r 1k : (2) Why binary neurons give a different result from analog neurons with noise.
