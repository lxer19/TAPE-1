Reference-contexts: Next, we discuss the algorithm implementation including several performance speedups. Finally, we discuss how the algorithm is embedded into a rail scheduling system and possible future extensions. 2 Problem formulation We use a subset of the "Z" notation for describing predicates and sets (c.f. <ref> [2] </ref>, Appendix A). It follows more or less the standard mathematical notation with the following peculiarities. 1 Thenumber of elements of a set S is denoted by #S . Pairs, triples, etc. are denoted by round brackets, e.g. (a; b; c). A uniform quantor notation, e.g.

Reference-contexts: The infrastructure constraints are created by means of the ExSpect system (see <ref> [3] </ref>, [4]). The ExSpect graphical editor is used to model the rail infrastructure by means of predefined building blocks. The ExSpect simulator is then used to create a file of infrastructure constraints. For details, see [7] The other constraints are added by means of ASCII files.

Reference-contexts: At the moment, the simplest form of scheduling has been chosen, i.e. constraint satisfaction. For some form of optimization, the necessary "penalty functions" were lacking. Our algorithm uses constraint propagation combined with backtracking (cf. <ref> [5] </ref>) to find a schedule satisfying an initial set of constraints. We start with describing the schedule requirements, leading to a mathematical description of the problem. Then we deduce some definitions and properties within the model framework. We continue by describing the rail scheduling algorithm.

Reference-contexts: This can be used to randomize the search and avoid a hard to detect dead end (c.f. <ref> [6] </ref>). 5 The propagation algorithm In the search algorithm, the assignment B M (X ) for a constraint set X : DC causes an expensive algorithm to be executed.

For details, see <ref> [7] </ref> The other constraints are added by means of ASCII files. There are (simple) absolute constraints, prescribing a time interval for the departure of a certain train and three types of relative constraints: departure-departure (DD), arrival-departure (AD) and arrival-arrival (AA).
