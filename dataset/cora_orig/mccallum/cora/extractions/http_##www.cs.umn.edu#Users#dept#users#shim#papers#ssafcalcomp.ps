Abstract: The authors would like to thank Dave Archer, Gary Delp, Larry Whitley and Walter Krapohl at IBM Rochester and Horst Truestedt, Edward Clausell, Richard Rolls, Michelle Tidwell and Howard Rankin at IBM Storage System Division for numerous discussions on the details of SSA. We also would like to thank Cort Fergusson, Mike Miller and Jim Coomes at Seagate Technology for providing us valuable information on FC-AL. January 6, 1997 DRAFT

Reference-contexts: The protocols that Fibre Channel supports include SCSI, Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI), High-Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI), Internet Protocol (IP). There is one FC-4 mapping protocol for each supported upper layer protocol. In Section III-A.2, we will describe one of the FC-4 protocols, Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI <ref> [3] </ref>. A.1 Fibre Channel Physical and Signaling Interface (FC-PH) 16 FC-PH defines three of Fibre Channel's functional layers, from FC-0 to FC-2. FC--0 (Physical Layer) specifies a variety of physical media, drivers and receivers for a wide range of transmission speeds.

Reference-contexts: It reserves full Fibre Channel bandwidth for dedicated Class 1 connections, but permit connectionless transmissions if bandwidth becomes available during idle Class 1 connections. FC-AL <ref> [4] </ref>, [5] is an enhancement to the Fibre Channel standards. It defines additional signals and control mechanism to support Fibre Channel for operating with the loop. In a loop topology, communicating devices share a loop interface which only supports one pair of nodes to communicate at a time.

Reference-contexts: Then we describe FC-AL in Section III-B. A. Fibre Channel Fibre Channel has five functional layers as shown in Figure 10. Among them, FC-0 to FC-2 are defined in Fibre Channel Physical and Signaling Interface (FC-PH) <ref> [7] </ref>. FC-3 (Common Services) is concerned with functions that span multiple N ports, including Striping (uses multiple N ports in parallel for their aggregate bandwidth), Hunt groups (allows more than one port to respond to the same alias address for higher efficiency), and Multi-cast (delivers information to multiple destination ports).

Reference-contexts: However, both of them have advantages and disadvantages. We believe that further studies are necessary to investigate the impact of their features on their performance for different applications. In a companion paper <ref> [8] </ref>, we have investigated the performance of both SSA and FC-AL under different types of traffic loads. The results not only allow us to understand their behavior but also can be used to effectively utilize the two technologies for potential applications.
