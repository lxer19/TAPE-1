Abstract: The main part of the S-CLE is an extensive Swedish grammar that is compiled into parsing and generation modules. The grammar formalism is a type of unification grammar loosely based on Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar (GPSG). The grammar is compiled and then parsed with a left-corner parser. Generation is performed using the Semantic-Head-Driven algorithm. Analysis turns sentences into "Quasi-Logical Form" (QLF), a logical-form representation, while generation works in the opposite direction. Intermediate stages include processing of morphology, syntax and semantics. For knowledge-base applications, a separate module can convert QLFs into conventional scoped logical forms. The current version of the system has a vocabulary of about 1900 words and covers a fairly broad range of possible grammatical constructions. Based on our experience in this project, we present in this paper detailed arguments to support the claim that customization of an English-language NLP system is a highly cost-effective way of constructing Swedish-language systems with corresponding functionality.
