Title: Users' Experience with ADIFOR  
Author: C. Bischof and A. Carle 
Date: February 1996  
Pubnum: 2.0  CRPC-TR96642  
Abstract: In July 1995, the ADIFOR 2.0 system for automatic differentiation of Fortran was made available to the academic and commercial communities via the World Wide Web. By January 1996, we had received and processed over one hundred requests for ADIFOR 2.0. In this paper, we describe some of the experiences of users of the system that should be interesting to developers of automatic differentiation tools.

It implements AD by using a source code transformation approach; that is, given a Fortran subroutine (or collection of subroutines) for a function f , ADIFOR produces Fortran 77 subroutines for the computation of the derivatives of this function.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing whether our insistence on receiving a signed license has scared away potential users of the software from even requesting it. Question: Did people read the manual <ref> [5] </ref>? Did they try the examples provided in the manual? Was it helpful? Answer : The majority of the users claimed to have looked primarily at the examples in the manual. Several commented that the examples were very useful, and several commented that they needed more examples.

Reference-contexts: In our experience, the interprocedural analysis phase of ADIFOR 2.0 processing is the most memory-consuming and time-consuming part of the process. The derivative code generated by ADIFOR 2.0 provides, as expected from the forward mode of AD <ref> [9] </ref>, the ability to compute directional derivatives. Instead of simply producing code to compute the Jacobian J, ADIFOR 2.0 produces code to compute J fl S, where the "seed matrix" S is initialized by the user.
