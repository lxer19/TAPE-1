Abstract: With the demand for multimedia and computational science applications, guaranteed performance communication services have become a necessary feature of future high-speed networks. These communications services should possess a high level of sophistication so that they can easily adapt the network to the wide variety of applications soon to be seen, thereby allowing the network to increase its availability and flexibility. Availability is the ability of the network to accommodate as many real-time clients as possible without violating any client's performance guarantees, while flexibility is the ability to adapt to changing network state and client demands in order to maintain the performance guarantees and quality of service promised to the client. Flexibility also refers to the ability of the network to easily increase the variety of real-time services that it offers. It is our contention that availability and flexibility can be enhanced in a network by providing the network with the ability to modify the performance parameters and/or the route of any guaranteed performance connection in the network without violating the previously made performance contracts. In this paper, we present a scheme for dynamically managing guaranteed performance service connections and experimental results to verify the correctness and usefulness of the scheme. The motivation for this scheme, Dynamic Connection Management (DCM), is discussed, and detailed descriptions of the DCM modification contracts and algorithms are provided. A survey of guaranteed performance services protocols, architectures, and routing algorithms are presented, together with their relevance to this work.

Reference-contexts: They are the plaNet routing algorithm, the scheme used by Codex, and a multicast routing scheme proposed by Kompella et al. The plaNet network is a high-speed packet switching network designed to support multiple classes of service <ref> [AhCh91] </ref>. The objective of the source routing technique used in plaNet is to minimize call blocking while ensuring low end-to-end delay. In plaNet only bandwidth is guaranteed by reservation, but delay is minimized as much as possible. <p> By load balancing among shortest paths, the load is distributed evenly among the links, and, when this is correctly done, this also tends to reduce call blocking. Results are provided in <ref> [AhCh91] </ref> to verify that these objectives are achieved. The routing algorithm used is a modified shortest path algorithm where the link weights are an increasing function of the link load (this promotes load balancing).

Reference-contexts: To accommodate the need for these real-time services, various protocols have been proposed that provide performance guarantees usually in terms of throughput, delay, delay jitter, and packet loss rate. Most of these protocols provide some subset of the performance spectrum specified above <ref> [AnHs90] </ref>, [Zhan90], [Topo90], with only one providing the entire spectrum [FeVe90a]. <p> The SCMP specifications include a CHANGE message that can be used to modify parameters but no formal descriptions are given of this "CHANGE" functionality, and no implementations have been reported in the literature. The Session Reservation Protocol (SRP) provides throughput and delay guarantees by reserving resources at each node <ref> [AnHS90] </ref>. The client is required to specify its traffic parameters using the DASH resource model. SRP creates sessions at each node, which represent reservations of a part of the capacity of a resource. These reservations are sufficient to guarantee the local throughput and delay requirements of the client.

Reference-contexts: Real-Time Network Routing (RTNR) is a decentralized routing technique developed by AT&T to provide routing for future dynamic class-of-service networks, which provide connections for voice, data, and wideband services on a shared transport network <ref> [AsCF91] </ref>. With RTNR, the source switch attempts to route an incoming call onto a direct trunk. If this direct trunk is not available, the switch attempts to find an available two-link route by first querying the destination switch 22 for the busy-idle status of all trunk groups connected to it.

Reference-contexts: The value of the congestion threshold can be varied to produce other scheme variations. In STR, usually the single-overflow scheme is used with a set non-zero value for the congestion threshold. Performance evaluations for combinations of these variants are given in [MaYa90]. Dynamic NonHierarchical Routing (DNHR) <ref> [Ash90a] </ref> was developed by AT&T and is a centralized, hybrid time-dependent and state-dependent route selection technique, where the time-dependent factor is determined by forecasted traffic patterns and the state-dependent factor is a response to network load variations.

Reference-contexts: This dynamic routing is only used in the case of network link failures and other unusual scenarios. DNHR has also been extended to provide state-dependent routing based on trunk status information. This new routing technique is called Trunk Status Map Routing (TSMR) <ref> [Ash90b] </ref>. The TSMR concept involves having an update of the number of idle trunks in each of the DNHR trunk groups sent to the centralized network database every T seconds.

Reference-contexts: Implementation. The Tenet scheme has been implemented as the Tenet protocol suite. These protocols decouple the control and data delivery algorithms. There are two control protocols, two transport layer data delivery protocols and one network layer data delivery protocol. The control protocols are the Real-Time Channel Administration Protocol (RCAP) <ref> [BaMa91] </ref> and the Real-Time Control Message Protocol (RTCMP). The two transport layer data delivery protocols are the Real-Time Message Transport Protocol (RTMP) and the Continuous Time Message Transport Protocol (CMTP) [WoMo91]. The network layer data delivery protocol is the Real-Time Internet Protocol (RTIP). 3.2. DCM Modification Contract.

Reference-contexts: Each supercomputer simulates a specific part of the experiment and passes its result, usually a large data set, to the other supercomputers, which use these results to continue their simulations <ref> [Catl92] </ref>.

The traffic characteristics and the performance requirements of these services are quite broad.

In this algorithm, the directed graph is constructed in the same manner as above. If the resultant route has a cost that is less than the delay bound, D, then the route is accepted and given to the administration algorithm.

Reference-contexts: A suitable update mechanism must be employed that reduces the resources consumed by update messages, yet provides useful, recent, and consistent state information. The mechanisms to be implemented and analyzed by simulation are Source-demand Routing - 29 - DCM Update Mechanism <ref> [EsRe92] </ref>, and incremental routing updates. The adoption of one of these mechanisms or the development of a more suitable mechanism should increase the efficiency of the routing algorithm. The channel establishment policy is a heuristic that can only be enhanced by constant observation.

Reference-contexts: In order to support increased availability and flexibility in a real-time integrated services packet-switching network, a Dynamic Connection Management (DCM) scheme has been developed. This scheme has been implemented in the context of the Tenet real-time protocol suite <ref> [FeBa92] </ref> and can be used to increase the availability and flexibility of real-time packet-switching networks. DCM achieves the goals of availability and flexibility by providing the network with two powerful capabilities.

Reference-contexts: These algorithms are based on the service disciplines at each switch; therefore, after the establishment phase, a priori end-to-end performance guarantees can be made to the client. The Tenet scheme is applicable to a heterogeneous internetworks running a variety of scheduling mechanisms <ref> [Ferr92] </ref>. C. Service discipline. The service discipline is of fundamental importance in the Tenet scheme as it ensures that the traffic and performance guarantees made to the client are satisified at run-time. Both the call admission and the resource reservation algorithms are based on it.

Reference-contexts: A real-time channel is a communication abstraction that defines a communication service with guaranteed traffic and performance parameters in a packet-switched network. The performance guarantees in the Tenet scheme are those of bounds on throughput, delay , delay jitter , and loss rate due to buffer overflows. In <ref> [FeVe90] </ref> it has been demonstrated that a connection-oriented network architecture with admission control and resource reservation is needed in order to offer a real-time service. <p> The schedulability resources also need to be reserved. Even without over-reservation of bandwidth resources it is possible to exceed the schedulability resource, as shown in <ref> [FeVe90] </ref>. A simple example of this is that of two packets with delay bounds of 5 units and service times of 3 units, which cannot be scheduled so that the delay bounds of both packets are met. Resource reservations are attempted during a round-trip establishment communication.

Dynamically Controlled Routing (DCR) <ref> [CaGa80] </ref> is a state-dependent routing method, developed by Bell-Northern Research, which uses centralized routing to determine the best routes, depending on the occupancy of the trunk groups. Each call is first offered the primary route. If this call is blocked, it is then offered to an alternate two-link route.

Reference-contexts: SRP does not employ any mechanisms for the dynamic management of sessions. The Asynchronous Time Sharing (ATS) approach provides a fixed menu of classes-of-services <ref> [LaPa91] </ref>. There are 4 classes of services. Three of the classes, Class I, II and III, transport user traffic while the fourth transports network management traffic. Class I traffic is characterized by zero percent contention 4 loss and an end-to-end delay distribution with a narrow spread.
