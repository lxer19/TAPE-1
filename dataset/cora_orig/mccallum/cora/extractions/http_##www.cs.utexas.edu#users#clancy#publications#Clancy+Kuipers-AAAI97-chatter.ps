Abstract: One of the major factors hindering the use of qualitative simulation techniques to reason about the behavior of complex dynamical systems is intractable branching due to a phenomenon called chatter. This paper presents two general abstraction techniques that solve the problem of chatter. Eliminating the problem of chatter significantly extends the range of models that can be tractably simulated using qualitative simulation. Chatter occurs when a variable's direction of change is constrained only by continuity within a region of the state space. This results in intractable, potentially infinite branching within the behavioral description due to irrelevant distinctions in the direction of change. While a number of techniques have been proposed to eliminate chatter, none of them provide a general solution that can eliminate all instances of chatter. Chatter box abstraction and dynamic chatter abstraction provide two such solutions to this problem. Both solutions eliminate chatter by abstracting the chattering region of the state space into a single qualitative state with an abstract direction of change. The algorithms differ in the manner in which they identify the chattering region of the state space.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes two solutions to the problem of chatter. The problem of event branching has been addressed by the model decomposition and simulation (DecSIM) algorithm <ref> (Clancy and Kuipers, 1997a) </ref>. DecSIM partitions the model into loosely coupled components and simulates the components independently to eliminate irrelevant distinctions between unrelated variables. Chatter branching is problematic due to the repetitive nature of the phenomenon. <p> Chatter is a major source of these distinctions. The techniques presented in this paper solve this problem. These techniques in combination with the DecSIM component simulation algorithm <ref> (Clancy and Kuipers, 1997a) </ref> significantly extend the range of models that can be tractably simulated using qualitative simulation thus supporting the application of qualitative simulation to tasks such as monitoring, diagnosis and design for complex, real-world systems.

Reference-contexts: If Flow-AB is not prevented from chattering by other constraints, it is free to chatter and must be identified as such within the current chatter box. A more detailed presentation of the algorithm is contained in <ref> (Clancy and Kuipers, 1997b) </ref>. Identifying the set of chattering variables The algorithm must determine if a variable v can chatter following the current time-interval state before a non-chattering distinction occurs. If such a variable exists, then the current state is contained within a chatter box.

Reference-contexts: Thus, ignore qdirs may result in over-abstraction and generate spurious behaviors. In addition, ignore qdirs often prevents the application HOD constraints to eliminate spurious behaviors and cannot be used to eliminate landmark chatter. DeCoste <ref> (DeCoste, 1994) </ref> addresses chatter when simulating Qualitative Process Theory models (For-bus, 1984) simply by ignoring distinctions in the direction of change when a unique value cannot be inferred via constraint propagation. He does not address the problem of landmark chatter nor does he provide an evaluation of this approach.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon tends to happen more often as the size of a model increases. While the techniques presented here have been developed as extensions to the QSIM algorithm, they could be applied in a similar manner to eliminate chatter from Qualitative Process Theory (QPT) models <ref> (Forbus, 1984) </ref>. Conclusions Recent discussions within the field of qualitative reasoning have questioned the usefulness of qualitative simulation when reasoning about the behavior of complex dynamical systems.

Reference-contexts: When possible, higher-order derivatives expressions are derived via algebraic manipulation of the constraints; otherwise, the operator must specify these expressions within the model. This technique, however, is not effective when an ambiguous evaluation of the HOD expression results or when an expression cannot be derived. Ignore qdirs <ref> (Fouche and Kuipers, 1991) </ref> eliminates chatter by ignoring distinctions in a variable's direction of change throughout the simulation. This technique requires the modeler to identify the chattering variables prior to the simulation. For many models, a variable's direction of change is ambiguous only within certain regions of the state space.

Reference-contexts: At times, some of these distinctions may be irrelevant to the current task and thus needlessly increase the complexity of the simulation. One of the major sources of irrelevant distinctions is a phenomenon called chatter <ref> (Kuipers, 1994) </ref>. Chatter occurs when the derivative of a variable is constrained only by continuity within a region of the state space. Within the simulation, the variable is free to alternate between increasing, steady, and decreasing with individual behaviors generated for different order-ings of these values. <p> Chatter and Qualitative Simulation Both of the algorithms presented have been developed as extensions to the QSIM simulation algorithm <ref> (Kuipers, 1994) </ref>. QSIM describes the behavior of a dynamical system via a tree of alternating time-interval and time-point states called a behavior tree. Each state specifies a qualitative magnitude and a direction of change (qdir) for each variable within the model.

Reference-contexts: While chattering behaviors may describe a real behavior of the system <ref> (Kuipers et. al., 1991) </ref>, a disjunctive enumeration of all possible combinations of values provides no information. Furthermore, this enumeration obscures other distinctions within the description and can result in an infinite simulation. <p> Eliminating this source of distinctions is essential if qualitative simulation is to be used to reason about complex dynamical systems. Previous Solutions Two previous methods have been developed for eliminating chatter within a QSIM behavior tree simulation. The higher order derivative (HOD) <ref> (Kuipers et. al., 1991) </ref> technique uses the second and third order derivatives of the chattering variables to determine a unique direction of change for unconstrained variables and eliminate spurious behaviors. <p> When possible, higher-order derivatives expressions are derived via algebraic manipulation of the constraints; otherwise, the operator must specify these expressions within the model. This technique, however, is not effective when an ambiguous evaluation of the HOD expression results or when an expression cannot be derived. Ignore qdirs <ref> (Fouche and Kuipers, 1991) </ref> eliminates chatter by ignoring distinctions in a variable's direction of change throughout the simulation. This technique requires the modeler to identify the chattering variables prior to the simulation. For many models, a variable's direction of change is ambiguous only within certain regions of the state space. <p> This algorithm is an extension of the algorithm used when deriving HOD expressions <ref> (Kuipers et. al., 1991) </ref>. If a potentially chattering variable is changing within a time-interval state, a focused envisionment 1 is used to explore the current region of the state space and determine which variables, if any, exhibit chatter.
