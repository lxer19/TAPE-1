Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) systems exploit user feedback by generating an optimal query with respect to a particular information need. Since obtaining an optimal query is an expensive process, the need for mechanisms to save and reuse past optimal queries for future queries is obvious. In this article, we propose the use of a query base, a set of persistent past optimal queries, and investigate similarity measures between queries. The query base can be used either to answer user queries or to formulate optimal queries. We justify the former case analytically and the latter case by experiment.

Reference-contexts: A similar stand for the view of queries was taken by Bollmann & Raghavan <ref> [2] </ref>. Particularly, through carefully studied counterexamples, they showed that it was misleading to consider documents and queries to be elements of the same space because notions of similarity, preference, linearity, and term independence that may prevail on documents do not necessarily carry over to queries and vice versa.

Reference-contexts: a 5-tuple S = (T; I; R; V; ff); where: T is a set of index terms; I is a set of documents; R is a set of queries; V is a positive real set; ff : RXI =) V is a retrieval function between a query and a document <ref> [3] </ref>. It is common in Information Retrieval (IR) systems to represent each document by means of index terms (also known as keywords or index words). They are extracted from either the body of a text or a surrogate text (e.g., abstract) through a process of indexing.

Das-Gupta has suggested the use of common terms to characterize the classes of queries <ref> [4] </ref>. G. S. Jung's Ph.D. work [8] however shows that clustering schemes based on query terms are doomed to fail. This case can partly be explained by the fact that queries tend to be short [15].

Reference-contexts: A second place where past optimal queries can be useful is during the process of formulating an optimal query by relevance judgments. For example, the persistent query to which a user query has the maximum similarity can be used as the initial vector in a steepest descent method <ref> [5] </ref>, adapted by S.K.M. Wong and his colleagues for optimization of queries [17; 18]. When such a persistent query is used as the initial vector in a steepest descent method, we believe that the steepest descent algorithm would take fewer iterations to converge. <p> For example, the cosine similarity, the inner product of two normalized vectors, is invariant to rotation and dilation, but is not invariant to translation and general linear transformations <ref> [5] </ref>. That is, it does not satisfy the second property of solution region. We explain this through an example. In Figure 1, an arbitrary solution region C is defined under the assumption that the query space is 2 -dimensional.

Reference-contexts: The resulting initial partition of the query collection is fed to the clustering program, which constitutes the second part. This program is an implementation of the iterative optimization method, which was adapted from Ismail & Kamel's ABF algorithm <ref> [6] </ref>. ABF algorithm iterates between DHB and DHF search techniques alternatively. In DHB algorithm, the clustering is based on breadth-first search, a query is reassigned to the cluster that yields the best improvement in the objective function.

Reference-contexts: Note that Q opt ; returned by the steepest descent algorithm, is not unique, and the region in which the optimal queries lie is called a solution region. Furthermore, the solution region C is convex cone <ref> [9] </ref>, that is, (1) Q 2 C =) kQ 2 C for all k &gt; 0; and A similarity function for query-to-query similarity should take those properties of the solution region into account.

Reference-contexts: To provide reasonable retrieval or optimal retrieval, researchers in the discipline of IR systems have introduced linear and inductive classifiers that use relevance feedback with respect to a retrieval output <ref> [13; 14; 15] </ref>. Note that an optimal query is defined to be a linear classifier that separates the documents judged relevant by a user from those judged nonrelevant, among a sample of documents examined by the user. <p> We also compare each case against the case where the vector sum of the user query and its maximum persistent query is used as the initial vector. 3.1 Design of the Experiment We use the Cranfield collection (1,400 documents and 225 queries) in our experiment <ref> [15] </ref>. A query base is constructed in three stages. The first stage is used to create three data files from a given collection such that they can be processed in next stages. The first two data files contain vector forms of queries and documents, respectively. <p> Das-Gupta has suggested the use of common terms to characterize the classes of queries [4]. G. S. Jung's Ph.D. work [8] however shows that clustering schemes based on query terms are doomed to fail. This case can partly be explained by the fact that queries tend to be short <ref> [15] </ref>. Furthermore, the terms of a query would not give reliable information unless the query is optimized. We are inclined to incorporate preference information into clustering queries, which is also consistent with the theoretical standpoint presented in previous section. <p> For example, the percentage of the pairs of user queries whose similarity values is less than 0.1 is 0.97. This case directly contradicts our basic premise that the similarity among users' needs is not a rare event. For other traditional document collections such as CISI and MED <ref> [15] </ref> we have obtained similar results to the one presented here. We plan to continue our experiment on a larger, more modern data set. Hence, the experiment described in this paper should be treated only as a preliminary test of our hypothesis. 4.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, one can use the formula s = (d + 1) 1 ; where s and d stand for similarity and dissimilarity, respectively, to transform a dissimilarity function into a similarity function <ref> [16] </ref>. We categorize similarity measures between queries into three groups. First categorization is called query-to-query. Similarity measures in that group such as the cosine similarity use only the query representations.
