Abstract: The Internet has traditionally relied on end-to-end congestion control performed at the transport layer by TCP. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of this approach to address the large number of flows and the large delay-bandwidth product scenarios typical of next generation Internets. We propose a link layer back-pressure flow control which can be applied to Internet backbones over ATM. More precisely, we use the ABR service and flow control and we turn routers into virtual sources (VSs) and virtual destinations (VDs) for the ABR control loop. We introduce a VS/VD "behavior" that implements a rate based back-pressure flow control and that addresses max-min fairness.

Reference-contexts: The IEFT Internet Integrated Services (ISS) working group is investigating new services and features to allow the Internet to transport multimedia traffic <ref> (Braden et al. 1994) </ref>. As a result, we are bound to experience an ever increasing demand for transmission resources, already a reality given the exponential growth of current Internet traffic.

Reference-contexts: Hence, actions to remedy congestion are only taken when congestion sets in. The associated reaction time is in the order of end-to-end round trip times (RTTs). Furthermore, it has been argued <ref> (Morris 1997) </ref> that TCP alone cannot fairly and effectively control a very large number of sessions, an increasingly frequent scenario in the Internet. Increasing the bandwidth available on backbone links and/or increasing buffering space on routers can help accommodate the traffic of a very large number of sessions (Morris 1997), but <p> been argued <ref> (Morris 1997) </ref> that TCP alone cannot fairly and effectively control a very large number of sessions, an increasingly frequent scenario in the Internet. Increasing the bandwidth available on backbone links and/or increasing buffering space on routers can help accommodate the traffic of a very large number of sessions (Morris 1997), but TCP sessions are not generally subjected to admission control. In this paper we describe a rate based back-pressure flow control that acts on the aggregate traffic between each pair of routers. <p> However, if the flow ad is responsible for the abuse of V C d , the flow bd is also penalized in the process and the TCP mechanism cannot selectively slow down the ad flow. Namely, TCP alone cannot ensure fairness <ref> (Morris 1997) </ref>. A number of other unfair TCP behaviors have been addressed in (Floyd et al. 1991, Floyd 1991). Hence, the best to alleviate the congestion on the router of Figure 1 and to avoid packet losses is to selectively back-pressure the flow ad . <p> Table 1 Packet loss and aggregate throughput.

Since ATM has been extensively used as a link layer for Internet backbones, and this trend is likely to persist for the near future, we address this congestion control problem in the IP over ATM scenario.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the response time is in the order of the RTT between the edge router and the point of congestion. Our flow control approach builds on the work in <ref> (Pazos et al. 1997) </ref>, where the use of the ATM ABR service was suggested for Internet backbones. Namely, the links interconnecting IP routers are ABR VCs, rather than the more conventional CBR or UBR VCs. <p> Finally, we use the ABR service on the VCs interconnecting the routers in Figure 2 where a Minimum Cell Rate (MCR) is allocated to implement bandwidth guarantees to the backbone traffic. This approach, as described in <ref> (Pazos et al. 1997) </ref>, improves ATM network utilization and throughput for the Internet traffic as compared to the more common approach of using the CBR service. 4 FLOW CONTROL APPROACH Let us now elaborate a little further on the congestion issue we are addressing in this paper. <p> Since ATM has been extensively used as a link layer for Internet backbones, and this trend is likely to persist for the near future, we address this congestion control problem in the IP over ATM scenario. Our approach follows the suggestions in <ref> (Pazos et al. 1997) </ref> to use the ABR service in the backbones and we define an appropriate Virtual Source and Virtual Destination behavior for the IP routers terminating the ABR control loop. Such approach effectively implements a back-pressure mechanism that addresses max-min fairness.

Reference-contexts: This is clearly a hard problem to solve unless an end-to-end rate based (or credit based) feedback mechanism such as the ABR flow control (ATM Forum 1996) is employed. However, since most WAN TCP sessions transfer only a few kilo-bytes of data <ref> (Paxson 1993) </ref>, and since convergence to the fair share of the available bandwidth may take a number of RTTs (Jain et al. 1996), the efficiency of the ABR flow control may be compromised.

The Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) approach proposed for IPv6 in (Floyd 1995) attempts to provide feedback control from the network layer (IP) to TCP. <p> Such binary feedback may reduce implementation complexity, but it is well known to lead to unfairness, oscillation, and slow response to congestion (An et al. 1997). Hence, many ABR flow control schemes employ explicit rate indication <ref> (ATM Forum 1996, Jain et al. 1996) </ref> or relative rate indications (Chiussi et al. 1997), as a means to solve or at least alleviate these problems. A Rate Based Back-pressure Flow Control for the Internet Challenges also arise in the transport of TCP traffic over ATM using the UBR service.

Hence, using ECN in the forward direction has the same problems as discussed in section 4.

Reference-contexts: The equivalent of ECN has also been proposed in ATM under the name of FECN (Forward ECN) for the flow control of ABR connections <ref> (Newman 1994) </ref>. In this case, the sources implement a multiplicative decrease of their sending rates upon congestion indication, and an additive increase when there is no congestion in the network.

Reference-contexts: The UBR traffic is not subjected to flow control at the ATM layer and cells are dropped when a congestion threshold is exceeded. In this scenario, the ATM switches usually employ Early Packet Discard (EPD) mechanisms <ref> (Romanow et al. 1994, Wu et al. 1997) </ref> to alleviated the source synchronization problem caused by tail dropping. Fairness problems also arise and selective dropping approaches such as the "Virtual Queueing" (Wu et al. 1997) address this issue.
