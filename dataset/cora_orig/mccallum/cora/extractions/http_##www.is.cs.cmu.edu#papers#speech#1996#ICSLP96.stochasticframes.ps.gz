Abstract: A stochastically based approach for the semantic analysis component of a natural spoken language system for the ATIS task has been developed. The semantic analyzer of the spoken language system already in use at LIMSI makes use of a rule-based case grammar. In this work, the system of rules for the semantic analysis is replaced with a relatively simple, first order Hidden Markov Model. The performance of the two approaches can be compared because they use identical semantic representations despite their rather different methods for meaning extraction. We use an evaluation methodology that assesses performance at different semantic levels, including the database response comparison used in the ARPA ATIS paradigm.

Reference-contexts: We use a multi-level evaluation methodology that assesses performance of the understanding module at different stages, i.e., the semantic representation at various levels of precision including the database response comparison adopted in the ATIS ARPA evaluation paradigm for natural language understanding systems <ref> [1] </ref>. This allows for a precise error analysis when evaluating the two approaches, so as to determine their relative strengths and weaknesses. Evaluation using the ATIS ARPA reference answers allows for comparison with previously reported results on the same data. 2. <p> Given that the rule-based understanding component is not error-free, the preliminary labels must be verified. In order to simplify this task, all semantic representations that have judged incorrect according to the database response evaluation <ref> [1] </ref> are flagged for manual correction. 5. MULTI-LEVEL EVALUATION A multi-level performance evaluation method is used to measure the performance of the understanding component at different stages. The ARPA ATIS paradigm [1] for the natural language systems evaluation was carried out on the SQL database response. <p> In order to simplify this task, all semantic representations that have judged incorrect according to the database response evaluation <ref> [1] </ref> are flagged for manual correction. 5. MULTI-LEVEL EVALUATION A multi-level performance evaluation method is used to measure the performance of the understanding component at different stages. The ARPA ATIS paradigm [1] for the natural language systems evaluation was carried out on the SQL database response. Even though the this paradigm allows comparison of results in the natural language processing community, it does not directly reflect the performance of the understanding component itself. <p> This measure may in fact be stricter than is necessary and a more appropriate evaluation may be to consider only errors on concepts and values, since these are relevant for database access.

Reference-contexts: Stochastic methods for speech understanding have already investigated in the BBN-HUM [8] and the AT&T-CHRONUS [6] systems. In this paper we present a strategy for semantic decoding in which a stochastic model replaces a rule-based analysis. The rule-based system was originally developed for L'ATIS <ref> [2] </ref>, a French language system for the Air Travel Information Services (ATIS) task. This component, based on a case grammar formalism [3], offers the advantage that it does not require verifying the correct syntactic structure of a query, but extracts its meaning using syntax as a constraint. <p> The robust parsing in CMU's PHOENIX system follows this strategy and applies a case grammar formalism [4]. L'ATIS, a spoken language understanding system for a French version of the ARPA ATIS task has been previously described <ref> [2] </ref>. Its spoken language understanding component is also based on a case grammar formalism [3] which detects domain-related concepts and instanciates the corresponding semantic structure using a set of constraints. <p> Such preprocessing is relatively easy in a limited task such as ATIS. However this type of analysis is rather domain-dependent and delicate to mainip-ulate. In order to carry out a systematic and exhaustive conceptual analysis, the preprocessing component in <ref> [2] </ref> has been extended and refined. The first step involves query simplification. The input is converted to lower case, numbers converted to digit strings and codes written as single words (a p slash eighty ) ap/80). Whenever possible, names are replaced by their database codes.

Reference-contexts: Parsing failures due to ungrammatical syntactic constructs may be reduced, if those portions containing important semantic information could be identified whilst ignoring the non-essential or redundant parts. The robust parsing in CMU's PHOENIX system follows this strategy and applies a case grammar formalism <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The semantic sequences can be derived from the case frame representation by aligning the concepts, case markers and constraining values. The semantic decoder, an ergodic bigram backoff HMM <ref> [5] </ref>, outputs the most likely semantic sequence given the unknown input query. Using the token-value pairs of the preprocessed query, the template matcher reconverts the semantic sequence into a semantic frame for use by the database access and response generation components. <p> As a result, the corpora are limited in size which is problematic for maximum likelihood estimators as they do not adequately model events that are rarely observed in the training data. In addition to back-off techniques <ref> [5] </ref>, one possible solution is to preprocess the data using a conceptual analysis. Unification of the input simplifies the work done during semantic analysis, but more importantly reduces the number of parameters and thus the model size. Such preprocessing is relatively easy in a limited task such as ATIS.

Reference-contexts: Proc. ICSLP 1996 Oct. 1996 1 In order to investigate language portability, the spoken language understanding component was ported to American English using the type A queries of the ARPA ATIS2 corpus for iterative rule development and testing <ref> [9] </ref>. The porting process consisted of translating and modifying the case grammar and the rules for response generation. Throughout development, the understanding component was iteratively evaluated in order to monitor the consistency of the changes. <p> Prior to training and testing the corpora were semantically annotated. The test data consist of the transcriptions of the 402 type A queries in February 1992 ATIS ARPA Benchmark test. The English rule-based understanding component of L'ATIS <ref> [9] </ref> was used to produce a semantic frame for each query and along with a preliminary sequential representation (Figure 2).
