Abstract: In analog system design, final verification in the presence of parasitic loading effects is crucial to guarantee functionality of the entire circuit. In this paper, we present a methodology for analog system verification in the presence of parasitics using behavioral simulation. When applied to a synthesized 10 bit D/A, our approach is accurate to 0.005 LSB compared with SPICE, while being several orders of magnitude faster.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We have proposed a constraint-driven, top-down design methodology for mixed-mode systems <ref> [1] </ref> that is supported by analog design tools. An integral part of such methodology is the complete verification of the synthesized circuit in the presence of parasitics due to routing, supply variations, and coupling. <p> In some design methodologies such as standard cell analog designs, designers verify each cell extensively by SPICE simulation. Yet, the final system of interconnected cells may fail due to interconnect parasitics or cell interactions. In contrast, our top-down design methodology <ref> [1] </ref> decomposes a system into its components, then the components into subcomponents using the same methodology until constraint-driven physical layout synthesis. In such a design environment, the key verification tasks are the verification of component functionality and the verification of the system after the components are routed in a system. <p> Furthermore, once the design is done, circuit yield can be computed by Monte Carlo integration over the distribution s. 4 Experimental results We verified an industrial strength 10 bit D/A <ref> [1] </ref> bottom-up from layout to system level performance on a DEC 5000/125. By using the adjoint technique for sensitivity analysis on the linearized chip-level interconnect network, we computed efficiently the INL performance sensitivity with respect to all chip level routing resistances.

Reference-contexts: Because parasitics degrade analog system performance, it is crucial to verify by simulation as completely as possible the circuit functionality in the presence of these second order effects. Existing design methodologies, manual or automatic <ref> [2, 3, 4] </ref>, use SPICE simulations to verify the final designs at the transistor level. Unfortunately, SPICE simulations often fail for larger systems due to non-convergence or unreasonable computational cost. For example, to simulate process variations of a circuit, designers traditionally use worst case analysis.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, designers simulate a subset of the process corners, but no general algorithm has been proposed for choosing the subset. Due to the difficulties, sevaral behavioral simulation approaches have been proposed earlier <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. Unfortunately, they do not take into account loading parasitics and must also use worst case analysis to compute process variation effects. In some design methodologies such as standard cell analog designs, designers verify each cell extensively by SPICE simulation.

Reference-contexts: Such prediction is consistent with data in [8]<ref> [9] </ref>. Although theories for mismatches in MOS transistors were developed in [9] based on spatial frequency, we propose here a new theory that can compute covariance of transistor parameters in large transistor arrays efficiently by using sensitivity analysis and matrix algebra. 3.2 From SPICE netlist to behavioral models We extract behavioral model parameters from netlist for each component using SPICE.

Reference-contexts: Definition 2 The output vector,t, of a D/A converter is an n-dimensional vector, where the i th component of t, t (i), is the output for input code i. In our previous work <ref> [10] </ref>, we approximate the distribution of t as a multivariate Gaussian distribution, t ~ normal ( t ; t ) (12) We compute the nominal values, t , by calculating the output current for every input code using a behavioral simulator which takes as input the deterministic mismatch, the output resistance,

Reference-contexts: Intuitively, Definition 5 means that we transform t using constants a and b such that the two end-points are ideal. In this case, we have adopted the more popular end-point method for linear error compensation <ref> [11] </ref>. The motivation behind the transformation is to compensate for the offset and gain errors before calculation of nonlin earity. In many applications, offset and gain errors are irrelevant as they do not contribute to distortion.

Reference-contexts: In other words, any realization of s must fall into a space spanned by r s independent basis vectors. A set of such independent basis vectors can be found by singular value decomposition <ref> [12] </ref> of s . Mathematically, s = U s cs U s (19) where U s is a 2 N x r s transformation matrix, cs is an r s x r s diagonal matrix, and r s is the rank of cs .
