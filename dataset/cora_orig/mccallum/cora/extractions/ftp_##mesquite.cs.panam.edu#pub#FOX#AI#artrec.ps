Reference-contexts: It is sufficient in speech recognition to infer the words from the input without inferring the meaning behind the input 2 (e.g. speech recognition) is a form of problem solving requiring abduction <ref> [2, 1, 22, 16, 9] </ref>. One can clearly define a perceptual problem as a form of abduction, that is, that given findings to the percepts (eyes, ears), an intelligent agent attempts to explain these inputs in terms of hypotheses related to those percepts.

Reference-contexts: We attempt to explain a spoken utterance in terms of the meaning behind the communication. Few researchers in abduction have actually implemented any perceptual recognition/understanding systems using an abductive strategy. However, many past speech recognition systems can be thought of as abductive (for instance Hearsay-II <ref> [3] </ref> or the more recent Sphinx system [13] can be thought of as implicitly abductive while not using an explicit abductive problem solving strategy).

Reference-contexts: Among the problems are that those of linearity and temporality which must be enforced when using phonemes. Syllables are based more on distinctive features, and while syllables also imply linearity and temporality between syllables, there is not as strong of a need to enforce these within the syllables. See <ref> [4] </ref> for more detail on this argument. 6 When the lexicon is expanded to include polysyllabic words, an addition level and an additional abducer will be used to generate word hypotheses to explain syllable hypotheses 4 Next, word hypotheses which account for the same temporal position of the utterance are made

Reference-contexts: However, because the task is to recognize speech and not understand it 2 , it is not necessary to implement a syntactic, semantic or pragmatic layer of knowledge. Abduction To implement the recognition system, we are using a strategy known as abduction. Abduction is inference to the best explanation <ref> [5, 12] </ref>. It is a form of problem solving in which findings are examined and explained in terms of domain hypotheses. Examples of abductive problem solving are clearly found in diagnosis, where disease or malfunction hypotheses are used to explain symptoms.

Reference-contexts: Early versions of this strategy can be found in the Red Blood Antibody Identification system [12], Pathex Liver Specialist [21] and TIPS [17]. The abductive strategy used here has been abstracted away from the medical domain and implemented in a problem solving tool called Peirce <ref> [7] </ref>. The system uses the abductive strategy of Peirce which is described in the following. The first step the abducer takes is to find confirmed hypotheses. These are hypotheses which are extremely well rated (or highly plausible).

Reference-contexts: However, such a requirement may cause a less than plausible explanation. It seems more reasonable to limit the composite hypothesis to what can be explained confidently rather than requiring full coverage <ref> [8] </ref>. This not only allows for a more plausible explanation overall, it makes the problem much less intractable. The following sections will describe how abduction can be used to solve the layered speech recognition problem described earlier.

Reference-contexts: Gestures are explained in terms of the monosyllabic words. A lexicon is used to generate word hypotheses based on the appearance and absence of necessary gestures. Jaw motion is used to determine word locations <ref> [23] </ref>. It is hypothesized that each jaw opening/closing is the utterance of a syllable. This is not strictly true, but does correlate well to the set of words (or syllables) used in our current lexicon.

Reference-contexts: Expansions to this system are planned; however, at present, the lexicon is very limited. The utterances used are of the form "Is it nine nine five pine street? No, its FIVE nine five pine street," where the capitalized word receives corrective emphasis <ref> [24] </ref>. Some of the utterances have a positive answer, "Yes its...". In such a case, no corrective emphasis appears because there is no word being corrected.
