Abstract: The companion paper "Geometric separator theorems" proved a large number of separator theorems about geometrical objects. We now find geometric separator theorems about geometrical graphs, and applications (mostly algorithmic) of them. N times, having 2N=3 sites inside and outside. II: Similar results for other geometrical graphs such as minimum matchings and traveling salesman tours, and in arbitrary dimensions. III: E-edge 2-connected torus (or Klein bottle) graphs, each of whose valencies and face sizes are 3, have a 1=3-2=3 separator with (4 + o(1)) p E vertices in the separator. The separator corresponds to a simple closed curve. IV: We exhibit V -vertex planar graphs such that any 1=3-2=3 separator must have cardinality 5V=2. V: We present the first subexponential algorithms for optimal traveling salesman tour and rectilinear Steiner tree of N points in d-space, d fixed. The runtime if d 2 is fixed is N O(N 11=d ) . The same runtime bound applies for finding a 1 + O(N p ) times optimal length Steiner tree in the Euclidean norm if p &gt; 0 is fixed. VI: Algorithm to determine all intersection relationships among N convex d-bodies with aspect ratios bounded by B. If a point of space can be in at most of the bodies (i.e. they are "-thick"), then the runtime is (log N + B d C)d O(d) N and the memory requirement is d O(d) N, where C is the amount of time required to test if two given objects intersect. VII: Solve linear systems whose graph structure is an intersection graph as in VI, in O([d 1=d BN 11=d ] ! ) time, ! &lt; 2:376. VIII: New data structure with O(log N) query time, O(N) space consumption, and O(N log N) build time, to support point location among N convex boundedly thick convex bodies of bounded aspect ratios in bounded dimension. IX: New algorithms for obstacle avoiding short paths among boundedly thick obstacles of bounded aspect ratio in the plane. E.g. this may be solved in preprocessing time O(N 3=2 log N) with storage O(N log N) and query time O(log N) to report a path 3:01 times longer than optimal (in the L 1 obstacle avoiding orems," we proved a large number of separator theorems 1 We use the same notation and basic definitions as there.

Reference-contexts: For N sites in 2D, the Delaunay triangulation edge-graph is planar and hence always has a graph-theoretic (2=3; p separator (cf. x5), but we argue that it need not have any separating circle. To do so, we exploit the fact <ref> [11] </ref> that the Delaunay triangulation of N sites in the plane, is the same as the convex hull of those N sites, stereographically projected onto a sphere in 3D. The separating circle is then going to correspond to a plane cutting the sphere and the convex hull.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore this separator may be found in O (V ) time. Surprisingly, it is possible to prove theorems of this sort by entirely geometrical methods. 5.1 Circles Spielman and Teng <ref> [29] </ref> observed that the Koebe circle theorem [17] states that any V -vertex planar graph may be embedded as V interior disjoint discs in the plane, such that two discs are tangent if and only if the two corresponding vertices were adjacent in the graph. <p> Hence from the 2D case of the Miller-Thurston sphere separator theorems above, we immediately obtain a (poly-time) (3=4; 1:83973 p V ) separator theorem for planar graphs <ref> [29] </ref>, and a (3=4; 1:90463 p V ) weighted separator theorem with arbitrary weights (summing to 1) on each vertex, edge, and/or face of a polyhedral planar graph.

Reference-contexts: graph has every edge length (in angular measure) &lt; q p 3V ), and such that every spherically convex region of area 4x, 0 &lt; x &lt; 1=2, x fixed, contains xV = p 12 + o (V ) points. (Such configurations may be constructed with, e.g., the techniques of <ref> [30] </ref>; one approximates the sphere by a sequence of developable surfaces on which are drawn equilateral triangle grids.) Now the result follows from the isoperimetric theorem on the sphere. 2 But, as we will now see, Djidjev's lower bound is improvable 6 in the range 0:08112 x 0:35759.
