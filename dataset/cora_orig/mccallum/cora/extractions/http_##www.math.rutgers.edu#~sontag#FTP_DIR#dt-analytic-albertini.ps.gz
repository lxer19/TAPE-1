Title: DISCRETE-TIME TRANSITIVITY AND ACCESSIBILITY: ANALYTIC SYSTEMS 1

Abstract: This paper studies the problem, and establishes the desired implication for analytic systems in several cases: (i) compact state space, (ii) under a Poisson stability condition, and (iii) in a generic sense. In addition, the paper studies accessibility properties of the "control sets" recently introduced in the context of dynamical systems studies. Finally, various examples and counterexamples are provided relating the various Lie algebras introduced in past work.

Reference-contexts: The extension to discrete-time of the results of Colonius and Kliemann depends critically on the better understanding of the forward accessibility properties of control sets, so we devote the last part of this paper to that goal. The reader is referred to the conference paper <ref> [1] </ref> for a detailed explanation of how the results in [2] can indeed be extended when applying the techniques developed here. 2 Basic Definitions In this paper we will deal with discrete-time nonlinear systems of the type (1) where x (t) 2 X and u (t) 2 U . <p> In fact we can find a one-dimensional, analytic system which is transitive but is neither forward nor backward accessible. One example of such a system is as follows. Consider the following system: x + = 1 + x + 2 with X = IR, U = <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, and where g (x) is the following function: g (x) = x It is easy to verify that jg 0 (x)j 1 for all x 2 IR. Moreover, g (x) = 0 if and only if x 2 ZZ n f0g. <p> The following example illustrates these facts. Example 6.4 Consider the discrete-time, analytic system with X = IR 2 ; U = <ref> [1; 1] </ref> 2 ; and equations: x + = x + 1 + 2 y + = y + v where g (x) is the function in (10). This system is invertible. <p> This system is invertible. In fact the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the map f u;v (x; y) is given by: 1 + 2 17 Since u 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>; j sin (y)j 1 and jg 0 (x)j 1, j 2 so the determinant is nonzero for all x, y. Moreover it is easy to verify that for each (u; v) 2 U , the map f u;v (; ) is bijective. <p> To prove (11), it is now sufficient to notice the following. For any fixed u 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> and any y 2 IR, the function x 7! x + 1 + 2 is invertible. Moreover h 1 (k + 1) = k for all k 1; independently of u and y. <p> However for discrete-time systems there are control sets D for which Core (D) is strictly contained in int D, as it is shown in the next example. Example 7.13 Let us consider the discrete-time, analytic system with X = IR 2 ; U = <ref> [1; 1] </ref> 2 ; and equations: x + = x + 1 + uy v g (x) where g (x) is the function in (10). This system is invertible. <p> This system is invertible. In fact the determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the map f u;v (x; y) is given by: 1 2 Since u; v 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>; and jg 0 (x)j 1, j 2 so the determinant is nonzero for all x, y. Moreover it is easy to verify that for each (u; v) 2 U , the map f u;v (; ) is bijective.

Reference-contexts: Recently, Colonius and Kliemann introduced the notion of control subsets of the state space of continuous-time systems. These are essentially sets where "almost reachability" 2 holds. Control sets have proved to be an extremely useful concept; in particular, in <ref> [2] </ref> these authors established an interesting relationship between such sets and chaotic behavior in subsets of an associated dynamical system. <p> The reader is referred to the conference paper [1] for a detailed explanation of how the results in <ref> [2] </ref> can indeed be extended when applying the techniques developed here. 2 Basic Definitions In this paper we will deal with discrete-time nonlinear systems of the type (1) where x (t) 2 X and u (t) 2 U . <p> dim L + (z 0 ) = 2 as desired. (4) Transitivity at z 0 is a consequence of (3) since dim L + (z 0 ) = 2 implies dim L (z 0 ) = 2. 7 Control Sets The next definition is a precise analogue of that in <ref> [2] </ref>, except that we make the assumption of nonempty interior. Definition 7.1 A set D X is called a precontrol set if D clos R (x) for all x 2 D and int D 6= ;.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper continues the study, initiated in <ref> [4] </ref>, of systems of the type x (t + 1) = f (x (t); u (t)) ; t = 0; 1; 2; : : : ; (1) where x and u take values in manifolds. <p> The smooth mapping f is assumed to be invertible on x for each fixed u, a restriction which models systems that arise when dealing with continuous-time plants under digital control. See <ref> [4] </ref> for further motivation for the study of such systems, and [9] for general definitions of systems. Given the system (1), one may introduce the reachable or forward-accessible set from a state x 0 , which we will denote by R (x 0 ). <p> In contrast, Property (C) may fail in discrete-time, even for systems obtained through the time-sampling of one-dimensional analytic continuous-time systems; see the examples in <ref> [4] </ref>. There are two known cases where (C) does hold: (a) When x 0 is an equilibrium point (and the system is analytic and the control-value set is connected); this is one of the main results in [4]. (b) If the map f is rational on states and controls; see [6]. <p> obtained through the time-sampling of one-dimensional analytic continuous-time systems; see the examples in <ref> [4] </ref>.

(b) If the map f is rational on states and controls; see [6]. <p> The most restrictive technical assumption to be made is that the system is invertible; this means that for each u 2 U the map f u = f (; u) : X ! X is a global diffeomorphism of X. Invertibility allows the application of the techniques in <ref> [4] </ref>; the assumption is satisfied when dealing with systems obtained by sampling a continuous time one. We will use f 1 u to denote the inverse of the map f u . <p> In Section 5.1 we make some further comments about this issue. 4 Certain Lie algebras of vector fields L; L + ; ; + were introduced in <ref> [4] </ref>, |see also [3] for previous work,| we repeat their definitions here for the convenience of the reader. <p> j dim L + (x) &lt; ng := fx j dim + (x) &lt; ng : Although well-defined always, the set B + L will be of interest only when the system is analytic. 5 2.2 Review of Main Known Facts With these notations, many of the results obtained in <ref> [4] </ref> can be visualized by the following diagram, where an arrow "A !

Choose n vector fields v 1 ; : : : ; v n in L such that fv 1 (y); : : : ; v n (y)g is a basis for L (y). As in the proof of Proposition 4.2 in <ref> [4] </ref>, we can assume that the v i 's involve Lie brackets of a finite numbers of vector fields of the form Ad k j u j , with k j 2 ZZ. <p> Theorem 2 Let be a discrete time, analytic, invertible system, and assume that the state space X is compact. Then, is transitive if and only if it is forward accessible. Proof. By <ref> [4] </ref>, Theorem 3, it will be enough to show that dim L + (x) = n for all x 2 X. <p> Proof. We will show (1) ! (2) ! (4) ! (3) ! (1). (1) ! (2) This is a consequence of Theorem 4 in <ref> [4] </ref>. (2) ! (4) Since the system is analytic, and X is connected it will be enough to show that there is at least one x with dim L + (x) = n, because the set where this property holds is either empty or open and dense. <p> The pointwise versions of <ref> [4] </ref>, Theorem 3, hold for these systems as follows. Lemma 6.1 Let be as above, and pick x 2 X. <p> Proof. (1) The necessary part follows from part (a) of Theorem 6 in <ref> [4] </ref>, so we will prove sufficiency. If is not forward accessible from x then f (x; u) must be independent of u. <p> ;:::;u 1 X + @ fi fi fi f 1 u k ;:::;u 1 ffif 1 u 0 ffif u 0 +v ffif u k ;:::;u 1 (x) = 0 15 which implies dim + (x) = 0. (2) The necessary part follows from part (b) of Theorem 6 in <ref> [4] </ref>. Sufficiency is a consequence of (1), since L + (x) + (x). Lemma 6.2 Let be a one-dimensional, discrete-time, invertible system, and pick any x 2 X so that is transitive from x. Then, either is forward accessible from x or is backward accessible from x. Proof.
