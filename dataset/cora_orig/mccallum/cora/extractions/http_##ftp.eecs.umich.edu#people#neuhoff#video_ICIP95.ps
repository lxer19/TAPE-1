Abstract: In this paper we present a simple frame-adaptative procedure for minimizing the total rate in classical block -based, motion-compensated lossless video coders. Our method can be applied to compress digital video for applications where no distortion is tolerated in the original video data. In motion-compensated video coding, motion vectors are used to improve the prediction of the current frame to be coded and must themselves be encoded with bits. In this work, we find an expression for the total rate of the current frame as a function of the number of bits allocated to the motion vectors. Then, we analytically derive the optimal motion bit allocations that minimize the total rate. We implement the video coder and present results on real video sequences, and discuss the potential applications of this work to the more interesting case of lossy video coding.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION We present a simple frame-adaptative procedure for minimizing the total rate in classical block-based, motion-compensated lossless video coders <ref> [1] </ref>. Our method can be applied to compress digital video for applications where no distortion is tolerated in the original video data, e.g., archiving and storing the original by the studio source, storing the original for post-processing, and storing or transmitting medical and military video data. <p> We used the minimum absolute difference method <ref> [1] </ref> to compute the motion vectors with subpixel accuracy, and the image blocks were of 8fi8 pixels. Also, the motion rates (8), (9), (10), were rounded to the nearest integer and were not allowed to be smaller than r T .

Reference-contexts: Our experimental results indicate that more advanced methods to encode the motion vectors <ref> [5] </ref> would only reduce the optimal total loss-less rate about 3 percent and hence the simple USQ choice is reasonable. The scalar quantizers have support [W; W ], where W is the expected maximum in-terframe displacement. But each has its own rate.

Reference-contexts: THE OPTIMAL BIT ALLOCATIONS To make an optimal rate allocation, i.e. to minimize the expression for R in (3), the encoder must be able to predict H ( ^p). To do this we assume that ^p (d) has a discrete Laplacian form <ref> [8] </ref> with variance oe 2 , and that oe is large enough that H ( ^p) log 2 2eoe: (4) As our estimate of oe 2 we choose oe 2 = P i=1 where E i is the energy of the difference between the ith block and the block in the <p> In our work real video frames are easily fitted to our fairly simple rate equation (7), from which optimal motion bit allocations are derived for the different modes of operation. Another interesting work is <ref> [8] </ref> where an entropy formula, similar to ours, is used to predict the rate of the difference frame encoder based on measurements of the difference frame energy, and then used to decide how to allocate motion bits in a hierarchical motion compensation scheme.
