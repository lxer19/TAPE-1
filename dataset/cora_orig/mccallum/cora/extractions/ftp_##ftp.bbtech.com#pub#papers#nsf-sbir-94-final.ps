Reference-contexts: Toward the end of Phase I, we began exploring the application of the ABI technology to real-world legacy systems. In a cooperative effort with Ford Motor Company, we are investigating the integration of legacy and reusable design engineering systems <ref> [1] </ref>. We expect this cooperation to expand in Phase II and beyond.

Reference-contexts: This language may be customized to the application or based on standard ontologies defined for the application domain. Researchers are currently working on developing domain ontologies that define sets of standard terms capturing relevant information from a particular area of expertise <ref> [2] </ref>. The ABI infrastructure provides hierarchical partitioning of the blackboard repository to correspond with the partitioning of the ontologies. Shared information on the blackboard must be represented in the defined shared language.

Reference-contexts: However, previous studies have shown that significant cost and quality savings are possible through the addition of collaborative functionality <ref> [3] </ref> and, in some domains, optimization of cost and quality is absolutely crucial to acceptance of the results.

Reference-contexts: TEAM was developed by Dr. Lander for her dissertation research at the University of Massachusetts <ref> [4] </ref>. It was built on top of an early, non-commercial implementation of the University of Massachusett's GBB system and was not intended as the basis for a commercial multiagent product.

Reference-contexts: This application, ABI-STEAM, performs parametric design of steam condensers using legacy components developed in the Mechanical Engineering Department at the University of Massachusetts <ref> [5] </ref>. Parametric design is a relatively simple form of engineering design in which the general form of an artifact to be designed is known but the designer must assign values to a set of variable parameters.

Reference-contexts: For example, the shared language used for storing data on the blackboards uses the full range of CLOS. This language is highly flexible and powerful and allows us to easily develop compliant interfaces for emerging standards for agent languages and protocols such as KIF/KQML [6,7] and CORBA <ref> [8] </ref>. 9 Summary of Accomplishments In summary, we have accomplished the following tasks in Phase I: * Defined a model for agent-based environments * Designed and implemented the objects, structures, and relationships in the agent model * Designed and implemented a prototype agent-encapsulation wrapper for legacy software systems * Designed a
