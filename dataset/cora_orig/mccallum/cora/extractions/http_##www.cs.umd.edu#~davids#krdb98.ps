Abstract: We are developing a system known as QUICK (for QUICK is a Universal Interface with Conceptual Knowledge) which provides simplified access to database systems. It allows users to develop applications and specify ad hoc queries without requiring them to understand the underlying schema. Users present high-level queries that specify only attributes to be selected and their constraints. In turn, QUICK infers corresponding SQL queries by using a knowledge construct called a context, which is derived from underlying conceptual schema. For most queries, the context provides enough information to insulate users from the underlying schema. The context does not contain sufficient knowledge to infer the corresponding SQL query from certain classes of high-level queries. Users must specify logical attributes and some of the joins already described by the schema. This paper identifies how relationship roles specified in the conceptual schema in conjunction with new knowledge representation constructs called pseudo-schemas and super-contexts can be exploited to generate reasonable queries on complex schemas for these classes of high-level queries. Both new constructs are automatically inferred from the original conceptual database schema. ____________________________ The copyright of this paper belongs to the paper's authors.

Reference-contexts: Automated Query Formulation Early approaches to solving this problem were explored in the development of the universal relation model [Kor84][Ley89][Ull89]. Unfortunately, the underlying representations used abstractions that are not typically used by database designers. Other approaches that use the more common entity-relationship (ER) models <ref> [Che76] </ref> either present a graphical user interface for selecting subgraphs which correspond to requests [Lie80][Zha83], or use universal relation concepts directly [Pah85][Wal84]. Others attempted to create automated query generators [Mar90], which resolve shortcomings of the universal relation model.

Reference-contexts: Thus, QUICK insulates the users from having to understand the semantics of the underlying database schema and from having to formulate complicated join clauses. QUICK accepts high-level queries expressed in the Universal SQL (USQL) language <ref> [Dia95] </ref>, which is a simplified version of SQL. The USQL interface requires users to specify only attributes and their constraints. Users do not have to specify table names and most join clauses described in the underlying conceptual schema.

Reference-contexts: Some commercial systems attempt to solve the same problem using ER constructs [Har98][Ora98]. All, however, still failed to provide the richness of expression needed for generalized queries. Problems with the previous systems were overcome by the development of QUICK <ref> [Sem94] </ref>, which is an intelligent data access system that simplifies the process of query formulation for application programmers and users that require an ad hoc query interface to a database. It extracts domain knowledge from a database conceptual schema and uses it to automatically formulate SQL queries from high-level queries.
