Reference-contexts: Further, the trade-off is such that in order to ensure tractable and complete reasoning, one must restrict the expressiveness of a knowledge representation language almost to the point of unuseability (except within restricted domains <ref> [Allen, 83, Bundy et. al, 1985] </ref>). The most common solution to this problem has been to combine fast, special purpose inference with a first-order logic theorem prover [Brachman et al., 83, Schubert et al., 83] or a weaker deduction system [Levesque, 84, Patel-Schneider, 85, Vilain, 85].

Reference-contexts: Accordingly we develop the syntax of ALL generally following the notation in <ref> [Apt, 88] </ref>. 5.2.1 Alphabets, Terms, and Propositions The language of access-limited logic consists of an alphabet and the formulas defined over it. The alphabet of an ALL consists of the following: 1. A countably infinite set of variables denoted v 1 ; v 2 ; . . . 2. <p> Thus P is the set of partitions of K. 4 Technical note: We often fail to distinguish between f and (f) (that is, between the fact f and the primitive path (f)), or between q and (q). 108 5.3.2 Substitutions We lift our notation for substitutions almost entirely from <ref> [Apt, 88] </ref> (with some modifications due to [Palamidessi, 89]). A substitution is a finite mapping from variables to terms: = fv 1 =t 1 ; . . . ; v n =t n g where v i (1 i n) are distinct variables. <p> We denote the most general relevant unifier of q 1 and q 2 as mgru (q 1 ; q 2 ). 5 It has been shown in <ref> [Apt, 88] </ref> that any propositions which are unifiable, have a most general relevant unifier. We also use some substitution notation specialized for the formalization of ALL. For a path ff let: fi ff = f j is a ground substitution ^dom () = vars (ff)g. <p> Thus before we prove Socratic Completeness we review some of the notation and results from Logic Programming. 5.5.1 Some Results From the Study of Logic Programming This section is essentially a summary of the relevant material in <ref> [Apt, 88] </ref>. A logic program consists of a set of program clauses of form: a b 1 ; . . . ; b n where a and b i (1 i n) are propositions 12 . <p> It is shown in <ref> [Apt, 88] </ref> that T P is monotonic. <p> Thus a and the b i can have a somewhat more general form than ALL propositions. 125 We abbreviate T P " n (;) by T P " n. Finally, the result we need for our completeness results below is found in the proof of theorem 3.25 in <ref> [Apt, 88] </ref>. For a ground proposition a and a logic program P : P j= a () a 2 T P " !: (5:27) 5.5.2 Mapping ALL Knowledge-Bases to Logic Programs In order to use this result we need a way to map ALL knowledge-bases to logic programs. <p> The meanings of the relations are thus restricted only by the contents of the knowledge-base (as in predicate calculus). The design of the inference mechanism in ALL has been heavily influenced by logic programming. The notation and results from the proof of the completeness of logic programming <ref> [Lloyd, 84, Apt, 88] </ref> have been used extensively in the completeness proofs for ALL. In a sense our use of access-paths is a strategy for ordering conjunctive queries and as such is related to the more elaborate approach given in [Smith & Genesereth, 85].

Reference-contexts: After Woods' influential "What's in a Link" paper [Woods, 75], many knowledge representation languages restricted the allowable relations to a small set which were given a precise syntax and semantics <ref> [Brachman, 79, Shapiro, 89] </ref>. Our approach in ALL is to define our semantics by "borrowing" the model theory of predicate calculus (by mapping ALL knowledge-bases to statements in predicate calculus and proving soundness and weakened completeness results) and to allow relations to be given any names.

Reference-contexts: One issue which has received little attention until recently is the issue of efficiency. Most proposals for default reasoning are computationally intractable, while in common sense reasoning, defaults seem to be used to speed up inference (see <ref> [Brachman, 90] </ref> p. 1090, and [Cadoli & Lenzerini, 90]). One possible application of the access limitations in Algernon (particularly the association of rules with sets of objects) is in the development of efficient approaches to default reasoning.

Reference-contexts: The most common solution to this problem has been to combine fast, special purpose inference with a first-order logic theorem prover <ref> [Brachman et al., 83, Schubert et al., 83] </ref> or a weaker deduction system [Levesque, 84, Patel-Schneider, 85, Vilain, 85]. The main problem with such systems is that though they answer some queries efficiently they mysterious fail on others (or never answer at all). <p> Past work has generally used the structure of the network only for special purpose reasoning (spreading activation, classification etc.), and has relied on a first-order logic theorem prover <ref> [Brachman et al., 83, Schubert et al., 83] </ref> or a weaker deduction system [Levesque, 84, Patel-Schneider, 85, Vilain, 85] for general reasoning. A notable exception to this generalization is the recent work of deHaan and Schubert [Schubert, 79, deHaan & Schubert, 86]. <p> Past work has made other divisions | e.g., the T-box and A-box of <ref> [Brachman et al., 83] </ref>. The second answer is that our goal is to develop a knowledge representation system with understandable inferential power. To this end, Socratic Completeness is a necessary (but not yet sufficient) property.

Reference-contexts: The problem of building a qualitative model of a complex system by selecting appropriate model fragments describing the objects in the system is an active area of research in the qualitative reasoning community <ref> [Falkenhainer and Forbus, 1988, Iwasaki, 90] </ref>. Some of the results of this work might eventually be applicable to the problem of selecting views of objects for default reasoning. <p> QPC should enable several types of research. First, it should enable research focusing on the representation and use of knowledge to choose the relevant objects and views of objects for answering specific question about complex situations <ref> [Falkenhainer and Forbus, 1988, Iwasaki, 90] </ref>. Second, it should enable research on the use of qualitative models to answer questions that go beyond the understanding compiled into the rules of a production system.

Reference-contexts: Arbitrary objects are intuitively the "x's" and "y's" in mathematical proofs (". . . consider an x, y and z such that x 2 + y 2 = z 2 . . ."). A full reformulation of first order logic using arbitrary objects has been worked out in <ref> [Fine, 85] </ref>. We expect future work on the expression of quantification in Algernon and ALL to be based on the theory of arbitrary objects. The full text of the Algernon solution to the sterilization example is given below. First we define representatives. <p> We expect to be able to formalize full quantification using the arbitrary objects of <ref> [Fine, 85] </ref>. The primary theoretical problem with mixed quantification, however, is that is it not clear what sorts of inference rules to allow.

QPC is of interest to the knowledge representation community primarily because it builds a bridge between a knowledge representation system and a qualitative simulator.

Some of the results of this work might eventually be applicable to the problem of selecting views of objects for default reasoning. <p> QPC should enable several types of research.

Second, it should enable research on the use of qualitative models to answer questions that go beyond the understanding compiled into the rules of a production system.

Reference-contexts: Clif Day's code implementing probability nets is given in the appendix section A.2. 4.3 QPC QPC is a qualitative model builder based on Qualitative Process Theory [Forbus, 84], but differing from past implementation of Qualitative Process Theory in that it builds QDEs 1 for simulation by QSIM <ref> [Kuipers, 1986] </ref>. QPC is of interest to the knowledge representation community primarily because it builds a bridge between a knowledge representation system and a qualitative simulator. <p> However, substantial progress has been made on efficient representations and algorithms for qualitative reasoning [Weld and de Kleer, 1990]. QSIM, in particular, can be viewed as an efficient special purpose theorem prover (with formally established soundness and completeness properties) in the domain of qualitative simulation <ref> [Kuipers, 1986] </ref>. QPC should enable several types of research. First, it should enable research focusing on the representation and use of knowledge to choose the relevant objects and views of objects for answering specific question about complex situations [Falkenhainer and Forbus, 1988, Iwasaki, 90].

Reference-contexts: A discussion of symbol grounding is far beyond the scope of this dissertation, but a suggestion of how it can be done is seen in the definition of places in <ref> [Kuipers and Byun, 1988] </ref>. 3 The code in Algernon contains some heuristics for generating the "internal form" such that in many cases it is identical to the name of the frame. <p> To do this one uses the :quote form. For example, in some robotics applications one might want to store a list of movement commands (these might be the commands necessary to navigate from one place to another <ref> [Kuipers and Byun, 1988] </ref>): (commands path (:quote (turn-right straight turn-left))) where turn-right is the name of a low level function (not an Algernon frame). At other times, one may wish to refer to a slot itself. This is done with the :slot form.

Reference-contexts: The most common solution to this problem has been to combine fast, special purpose inference with a first-order logic theorem prover [Brachman et al., 83, Schubert et al., 83] or a weaker deduction system <ref> [Levesque, 84, Patel-Schneider, 85, Vilain, 85] </ref>. The main problem with such systems is that though they answer some queries efficiently they mysterious fail on others (or never answer at all). ALL represents a new approach to this problem. <p> Past work has generally used the structure of the network only for special purpose reasoning (spreading activation, classification etc.), and has relied on a first-order logic theorem prover [Brachman et al., 83, Schubert et al., 83] or a weaker deduction system <ref> [Levesque, 84, Patel-Schneider, 85, Vilain, 85] </ref> for general reasoning. A notable exception to this generalization is the recent work of deHaan and Schubert [Schubert, 79, deHaan & Schubert, 86]. Algernon and the networks of Schubert share several features including the use of access limitations to guide reasoning.

Reference-contexts: However, such inference systems tend to be difficult to describe semantically and tend to place unnatural limits on an agent's reasoning ability <ref> [Levesque, 86] </ref>. Our solution to this dilemma is two fold. First, we have identified a set of inference mechanisms which can be efficiently computed in a network structured knowledge-base. <p> However, experience with formally specified knowledge representation systems has revealed an inevitable trade-off between the expressive power of a knowledge representation system and its computational complexity <ref> [Levesque, 86, Levesque & Brachman, 85] </ref>. Further, the trade-off is such that in order to ensure tractable and complete reasoning, one must restrict the expressiveness of a knowledge representation language almost to the point of unuseability (except within restricted domains [Allen, 83, Bundy et. al, 1985]).

Reference-contexts: The meanings of the relations are thus restricted only by the contents of the knowledge-base (as in predicate calculus). The design of the inference mechanism in ALL has been heavily influenced by logic programming. The notation and results from the proof of the completeness of logic programming <ref> [Lloyd, 84, Apt, 88] </ref> have been used extensively in the completeness proofs for ALL. In a sense our use of access-paths is a strategy for ordering conjunctive queries and as such is related to the more elaborate approach given in [Smith & Genesereth, 85].

Reference-contexts: Recently there has been growing interest in identifying tractable inference rules | inference rules under which implication is decidable in polynomial time.

Along these line, [Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 90] shows that, using a highly parallel implementation, certain queries can be answered in time proportional to the length of the shortest derivation of the query.

Reference-contexts: A good discussion of path based and node based inference (both of which are partially subsumed by inference in ALL and would be totally subsumed if ALL supported full quantification | see section 8.3) is given in <ref> [Shapiro, 78] </ref>. One difference between ALL and much recent careful work on knowledge representation is that ALL (along with first-order logic and the original work on semantic networks) allows the knowledge-base designer to name the relations used in the knowledge-base.

Reference-contexts: After Woods' influential "What's in a Link" paper [Woods, 75], many knowledge representation languages restricted the allowable relations to a small set which were given a precise syntax and semantics <ref> [Brachman, 79, Shapiro, 89] </ref>. Our approach in ALL is to define our semantics by "borrowing" the model theory of predicate calculus (by mapping ALL knowledge-bases to statements in predicate calculus and proving soundness and weakened completeness results) and to allow relations to be given any names.

Reference-contexts: Our use of access paths is closely related to previous work on path based inference.

Reference-contexts: One interesting result to come out of this work is that the power of tractable inference rules is dependent on the syntax of the language used [McAllester et al., 89] (see also [McAllester, 90] p. 1115). Along these line, <ref> [Shastri & Ajjanagadde, 90] </ref> shows that, using a highly parallel implementation, certain queries can be answered in time proportional to the length of the shortest derivation of the query.

Reference-contexts: In a sense our use of access-paths is a strategy for ordering conjunctive queries and as such is related to the more elaborate approach given in <ref> [Smith & Genesereth, 85] </ref>. In fact, if one follows a discipline of avoiding frame-slots containing a large number of frames 2 then the use of access-paths enforces an ordering on conjunctive queries much like that discussed in [Smith & Genesereth, 85]. <p> queries and as such is related to the more elaborate approach given in <ref> [Smith & Genesereth, 85] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In chronological backtracking, when a contradiction is found the most recent assumption is retracted. In dependency directed backtracking, the dependencies of facts in the knowledge-base on assumptions are explicitly maintained (often as labels on the facts <ref> [Stallman & Sussman, 77] </ref>). When a contradiction is found, an assumption which the fact depends on is retracted. Dependency directed backtracking can greatly reduce the length of proofs, but its formalization is more complex.

Reference-contexts: The most common solution to this problem has been to combine fast, special purpose inference with a first-order logic theorem prover [Brachman et al., 83, Schubert et al., 83] or a weaker deduction system <ref> [Levesque, 84, Patel-Schneider, 85, Vilain, 85] </ref>. The main problem with such systems is that though they answer some queries efficiently they mysterious fail on others (or never answer at all). ALL represents a new approach to this problem. <p> Past work has generally used the structure of the network only for special purpose reasoning (spreading activation, classification etc.), and has relied on a first-order logic theorem prover [Brachman et al., 83, Schubert et al., 83] or a weaker deduction system <ref> [Levesque, 84, Patel-Schneider, 85, Vilain, 85] </ref> for general reasoning. A notable exception to this generalization is the recent work of deHaan and Schubert [Schubert, 79, deHaan & Schubert, 86]. Algernon and the networks of Schubert share several features including the use of access limitations to guide reasoning.

Reference-contexts: helps in the control of inference (see section 4.1.1). * Algernon combines rules with a frame-based representation for knowledge, while a Prolog knowledge-base is unstructured (compiled Prologs gain a large part of their efficiency by structuring the Prolog knowledge-base according to a syntactic analysis of its facts and 159 rules <ref> [Warren, 83] </ref>). Two advantages are gained by the use of a frame-based representa-tion. First, frames have been found to be a useful way to organize knowledge (especially in large knowledge-bases).

Reference-contexts: Kuipers, 1973].) Responding to this problem, several research groups (e.g., [Lenat et al., 86]) have proposed the creation of very large, general-purpose knowledge-bases of commonsense knowledge that could be shared by a wide range of different applications. It has been apparent at least since the work of <ref> [Woods, 75] </ref> (and others such as [Hayes, 74]) that a knowledge representation language sufficient to support the building of large knowledge bases must have a clear semantics. <p> One difference between ALL and much recent careful work on knowledge representation is that ALL (along with first-order logic and the original work on semantic networks) allows the knowledge-base designer to name the relations used in the knowledge-base. After Woods' influential "What's in a Link" paper <ref> [Woods, 75] </ref>, many knowledge representation languages restricted the allowable relations to a small set which were given a precise syntax and semantics [Brachman, 79, Shapiro, 89].
