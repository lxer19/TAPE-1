Title: From Lakatos to Lattices: a Semantic Control of Cooperative Dialogues

Abstract: This paper proposes a pragmatic approach to dialogue modeling and control: assuming a cognitive background, a set of dialogue rules is considered so as to constraint the dialogue domain. The idea is then to investigate how knowledge and coordination are interwoven and how a common result which is "better" than a mere concatenation of each local points of view can be reached. It is shown that this semantic control of the dialogue is grounded on the exchanged knowledge itself and that a constructive use of conflicts is worth considering. The approach is based on philosophical backgrounds and proposes an algebraic formal model.

Reference-contexts: In a context where symbolic properties are exchanged (e.g. elaboration and assessment of a common situation <ref> [ Chaudron et al., 1997 ] </ref> ), the agents' assertions can be modeled by conjunctions of logical formulas captured by the cube model [ Chaudron, 1995 ] . <p> Based upon the same approach than for the anti-unification, the definition of such a reduction relies on the class of the substitutions on terms. Thus a subset C r of reduced cubes of C and a complete lattice on C r are defined <ref> [ Chaudron et al., 1997 ] </ref> . Example: This example comes from the military intelligence field. V1 denotes an object that was observed by two different sensors.

This formalism is based on a classical first order logi-cal language (Const,Var,Funct,Pred) whose set of terms Term is the functional closure of Const [ V ar by F unct.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, two different approaches can be distinguished: the representation-centered approach and the resolution-centered approach. The representation-centered approach is based on cognitive theories, assuming that each agent grounds his actions on an internal representation of the world, of himself and of the other agents' goals and skills (mental states <ref> [ Sadek, 1994; Cohen and Levesque, 1990 ] </ref> ): the agents have a limited knowledge and have to make assumptions on the other agents' intentions and beliefs. In fact, those models try to explain and simulate the behaviors of "real agents".

Reference-contexts: action of elaborating a common result (for instance, they do not try to manipulate each other and they are aware of that); 2. inter-operability: the agents understand each other (the vocabulary is domain-limited and unambiguous the same thing is understood under the same denotator); 3. quality: they follow Grice's maxims <ref> [ Grice, 1975 ] </ref> and do not resort to control elements for the dia logue (e.g. "let me speak"); 4. protocol: the mono-modal characteristic of oral communication is respected, the statements are set out in turn by each agent; 5. observability: a current result or solution is available at each time

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, modeling agents like pure decision makers presents many drawbacks for dialogue management: it is assumed that the agents know all the relevant information [ Rosenschein and Zlotkin, 1994 ] , or are able to know the suitable information through a "facilitator" <ref> [ Khedro and Genesereth, 1994 ] </ref> for instance, in order to elaborate and evaluate proposals. This is quite unrealistic when considering human-machine applications. <p> (e.g. "let me speak"); 4. protocol: the mono-modal characteristic of oral communication is respected, the statements are set out in turn by each agent; 5. observability: a current result or solution is available at each time t, either on a physical medium (blackboard, screen) or via a task-independent "fa cilitator" <ref> [ Khedro and Genesereth, 1994 ] </ref> . Given those rules, let us now focus on the knowledge that is exchanged through dialogue and how it is modified and enriched.

Reference-contexts: Such purposes are achieved thanks to an algebraic based approach. If the definition of the supremum and infimum operators can be supported by the set union and intersection in the propositional calculus frame, first order logic needs more sophisticated tools, especially for unification: we adopt the approach of <ref> [ Lassez et al., 1987 ] </ref> which allows a lattice on the terms algebra to be defined properly, thanks to the anti-unification operator.
