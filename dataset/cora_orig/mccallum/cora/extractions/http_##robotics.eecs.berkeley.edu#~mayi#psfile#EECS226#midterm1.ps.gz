Web: Explain.  
Note: a) X and Y are N(0; 1) rv's and X and Y are uncorrelated. Are X 2 and Y 2 uncorrelated?  1 AND X Y 1. c) the joint pdf of X and Y conditional on the event X Y 1 and X Y Z 1. d) Show that the pdf of X conditional on the event X Y 1 and X Y Z 1 is the same as the pdf of the rv min(U 1 U 2 where U 1 and U 2 are two independent and identically distributed rv's unformly distributed in [0; 1].
