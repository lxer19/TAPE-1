Reference-contexts: Qualities, and intensity, of emotion instances in each category are partially determined by some subset of roughly twenty-two different emotion intensity variables <ref> [ Elliott & Siegle, 1993 ] </ref> . To communicate with users the AR agents use various multimedia modes. A central assumption of these modes is that social interaction based on emotion states must run, dynamically, in real time. <p> For a full exposition see <ref> [ Elliott & Siegle, 1993 ] </ref> . The simulation-event and stable-disposition emotion intensity variables In general, there are two major variables that contribute to emotion intensity. There are correlates for both principle-based emotions (e.g., pride), and goal-based emotions (e.g., satisfaction).

Reference-contexts: of appraisal frames representing their individual goals (with respect to events that arise), principles (with respect to perceived intentional actions of agents), preferences (with respect to objects), and moods (temporary changes to the appraisal mechanism), and as a set of about 440 differentially activated channels for the expression of emotions <ref> [ Elliott & Ortony, 1992; Elliott, 1992 ] </ref> . <p> Second, we will have to implement some of the mechanisms from the Affective Reasoner in each agent to convert these triggering conditions into appropriate emotional states. For lack of space, this paper could not discuss the technical details behind these mechanisms, but they can be found in <ref> [ Elliott, 1992 ] </ref> . Finally, we will implement ways for the two agents to express their emotions (e.g., through facial expressions or speech). We expect to report on an initial implementation at the workshop. 7 Acknowledgment We would like to thank Lewis Johnson for his valuable comments on this work.
