Abstract: In this paper the following problem is considered: given a root node R in a mesh and a set D of nodes from the mesh, construct a shortest-path tree rooted at R that spans the set D and minimizes the number of links used. The problem is equivalent as finding a Steiner tree in a directed mesh in which all the links point away from the root node R. The problem of finding a Steiner tree in such grid has been known in the literature as the Rectilinear Steiner Arborescence (RSA) problem. Rao et. al [9] have proposed an efficient heuristic algorithm for a special case of this problem, in which all the nodes in D lie in the first quadrant of E 2 (assuming the tree is rooted at the origin). The algorithm has time complexity of O(j D j log j D j). They proved that the traffic generated by the heuristic has an upper bound of twice of that generated by any optimal algorithm. They have proposed an extension of this algorithm that solves the general case in which the nodes in D lie anywhere in the plane that runs with O(j D j 3 log j D j) time complexity. We propose in this work a similar heuristic with same upper bound that also has time complexity O(j D j log j D j) but solves this general case in which the nodes are allowed to be anywhere in E 2 .

Reference-contexts: The problem here is to find a Steiner directed tree for a set D of nodes lying in the grid, rooted at point R, using only horizontal and vertical arcs oriented away from R. Rao et. al <ref> [9] </ref> have studied the Rectilinear Steiner Arborescence problem when the set D lies in the first quadrant of E 2 , and the directed tree is rooted at the origin. They proposed a heuristic algorithm in which a Steiner tree H for D is generated by iterative substitution. <p> Otherwise it is 0. We assume that the root of the tree is the origin. This definition of max o (p; q) allows us to combine points from adjacent quadrants. This was not handled by the algorithm proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>. Let L z denote the four lines lying in the grid given by j x j + j y j= z. <p> Hence j j (x; y q ) j j z, contradicting the fact that p; q 2 W z . A similar proof works for the other 3 lines. 2 The following lemma is an adapted version of lemma 4 in <ref> [9] </ref>. Lemma 2 Let p i = (x i ; y i ) be a point in a SRSA generated by the heuristic. <p> A similar argument can be made for the y-coordinate. 2 Now assume that the points p and q lie in the first quadrant. The following two lemmas are taken directly from <ref> [9] </ref>. The proofs can be found in their paper. <p> The following theorem provides an upper bound for the traffic generated for the multicast tree by the heuristic. Its proof is similar to the proof of the upper bound provided in <ref> [9] </ref>. 4 Theorem 1 l (SRSA) 2l (RSMA). Proof: First, note that for any RSA A, l (A) = P z (A"L z ). We know that j L z "A jj M C (D; z) j for any RSA A. <p> Since z is arbitrary this holds for any z, and the theorem is proved. 2 The implementation presented in <ref> [9] </ref> for their algorithm can be adapted for our algorithm. The key idea is that Steiner points can only be introduced by the heuristic from adjacent points in W z . <p> To implement the algorithm a priority queue is used containing all the sinks below the lines in L z and all the j W z j 1 potential new Steiner points max o (p; q) for each pair of adjacent points p; q 2 W z . See <ref> [9] </ref> for details of the implementation. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm we ran simulation programs for an 8*8 mesh both for the optimal and the heuristic algorithm.
