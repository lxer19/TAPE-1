Abstract: Genetic Programming is a method of program discovery consisting of a special kind of genetic algorithm capable of operating on nonlinear chromosomes (parse trees) representing programs and an interpreter which can run the programs being optimised. This paper describes PDGP (Parallel Distributed Genetic Programming), a new form of genetic programming which is suitable for the development of fine-grained parallel programs. PDGP is based on a graph-like representation for parallel programs which is manipulated by crossover and mutation operators which guarantee the syntactic correctness of the offspring. The paper describes these operators and reports some preliminary results obtained with this paradigm.

Reference-contexts: The best results in terms of fitness evaluations were obtained using a grid with 8 rows and 8 columns with global mutation (pmut=0.02), full initialisation, SAAN crossover. With these settings E=25,000 and N=1,625,000. This compares extremely favourably with the results described by Koza in <ref> [11; 12] </ref> in terms of fitness evaluations (Koza obtained E=96,000 for P=16,000 and E=80,000 for P=4,000). This result is particularly interesting considering the small size of the populations used in this work (P=1,000). It should be noted that this level of performance is not a statistical accident.

This result is particularly interesting considering the small size of the populations used in this work (P=1,000). It should be noted that this level of performance is not a statistical accident. <p> In comparative terms in this experiment PDGP has solved the even-3 parity problem with approximately the same number of fitness evaluations as standard GP while producing solutions with 9 or fewer nodes. As the average complexity of the solutions described in <ref> [12] </ref> was 44.6 nodes, this seems to be a considerable saving. V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have presented PDGP, a new form of genetic programming which is suitable for the automatic discovery of parallel network-like programs.
