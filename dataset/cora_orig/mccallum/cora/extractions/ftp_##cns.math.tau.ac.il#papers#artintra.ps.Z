Abstract: In this work we re-analyze the objective function formulation of the BCM theory of visual cortical plasticity and introduce a new formalism that permits analysis of a laterally connected network of nonlinear neurons. This formulation provides a powerful method for the fixed point analysis and also the explicit calculation of these points in various networks condition.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The BCM theory of cortical plasticity has been introduced by Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro (BCM) <ref> (Bienenstock et al., 1982) </ref> to account for the clear changes observed in cell response of visual cortex due to changes in visual environment. It has been shown that a variant of this theory performs exploratory projection pursuit using a projection index that measures multi-modality (Intrator and Cooper, 1992).

Reference-contexts: The inhibitory lateral interactions were shown to push towards a selective solution in which different neurons become tuned to different features in input space.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that a variant of this theory performs exploratory projection pursuit using a projection index that measures multi-modality <ref> (Intrator and Cooper, 1992) </ref>. This learning model allows modeling and theoretical analysis of various visual deprivation experiments such as monocular deprivation (MD), binocular deprivation (BD) and reversed suture (RS) (Intrator and Cooper, 1992) and is in agreement with the vast experimental results on visual cortical plasticity (Clothiaux et al., 1991; Law <p> It has been shown that a variant of this theory performs exploratory projection pursuit using a projection index that measures multi-modality <ref> (Intrator and Cooper, 1992) </ref>. This learning model allows modeling and theoretical analysis of various visual deprivation experiments such as monocular deprivation (MD), binocular deprivation (BD) and reversed suture (RS) (Intrator and Cooper, 1992) and is in agreement with the vast experimental results on visual cortical plasticity (Clothiaux et al., 1991; Law and Cooper, 1994; Shouval et al., 1996; Shouval et al., 1997). <p> A network implementation which can find several projections in parallel while retaining its computational efficiency, was found to be applicable for extracting features from very high dimensional vector spaces (Intrator et al., 1991; Intrator et al., 1996; Huynh et al., 1997). In this paper we extend our earlier analysis <ref> (Intrator and Cooper, 1992) </ref> to a laterally connected network on nonlinear neurons. We characterize the space of solutions,their stability properties and their temporal evolution with different configurations of the cortico-cortical synapses (lateral interactions) such as inhibitory, excitatory and mixed, e.g., Mexican hat profile. <p> The dynamics based on the rule described in <ref> (Intrator and Cooper, 1992) </ref> is given by: _ ~ m (t) = D T ~ (c; ); (1) where c = ~m ~ d is the neuronal activity, ~m and ~ d are the synaptic strength and the incoming signal vectors respectively. <p> The function (c; ) = c (c ) is a quadratic function that change sign at a dynamic threshold; =&lt; c 2 &gt;= i=0 p i (m i d i ) 2 <ref> (Intrator and Cooper, 1992) </ref>. D is the inputs matrix, D = d 21 d 22 , which, in this case, includes two input vectors. <p> And the corresponding ~m solutions are ~m = D 1 ~c. Stability analysis <ref> (Intrator and Cooper, 1992) </ref> shows that the only stable states (in the Lyaponov sense) are those given by ( 1 p i ; 0; 0; : : :0) i = 1; : : : ; n. 3 Network with lateral interactions When a neuron is in a network, the incoming inputs <p> neuron The BCM rules can be extended also to nonlinear neuron, in which the neuron's activity is defined to be c = ( ~m ~ d) where is a usual smooth sigmoidal function: 5 The exact derivation of the learning procedure by using the the minimization of the objective function <ref> (Intrator and Cooper, 1992) </ref> gives: E [(( ~m ~ d); ) 0 ( ~m ~ d) ~ d] (15) From this we can write the analogous of the equation (1) as _ ~ m (t) = D ~ ; (16) where D is the input matrix, ~ is the vector of <p> The case of n nonlinear neurons without interaction, follows from the combination of the linear case and the nonlinear case. 4.2 Non linear neuron with lateral interactions The case of non linear neurons with lateral interactions, is also tractable, but requires the complete derivation from the objective function <ref> (Intrator and Cooper, 1992) </ref>. The objective function can be considered as an energy function, or a Hamiltonian, hence we can minimize this function with respect to some variable and we obtain the corresponding learning rule for this variable that leads to a minimization of the objective function.
