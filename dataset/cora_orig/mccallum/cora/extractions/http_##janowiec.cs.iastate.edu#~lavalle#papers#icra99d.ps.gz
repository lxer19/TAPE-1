Abstract: This paper presents a state-space perspective on the kinodynamic planning problem, and introduces a randomized path planning technique that computes collision-free kinodynamic trajectories for high degree-of-freedom problems. By using a state space formulation, the kinodynamic planning problem is treated as a 2n-dimensional nonholonomic planning problem, derived from an n-dimensional configuration space. The state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning; however, standard randomized path planning techniques do not directly apply to planning trajectories in the state space. We have developed a randomized planning approach that is particularly tailored to kinodynamic problems in state spaces, although it also applies to standard nonholonomic and holonomic planning problems. The basis for this approach is the construction of a tree that attempts to rapidly and uniformly explore the state space, offering benefits that are similar to those obtained by successful randomized planning methods, but applies to a much broader class of problems. Some preliminary results are discussed for an implementation that determines kinodynamic trajectories for hov-ercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces of up to twelve dimensions.

Reference-contexts: For the purpose of discussion, we choose two different techniques that have been successful in recent years: randomized potential fields (e.g, [2, 6]) and randomized roadmaps (e.g., <ref> [1, 15] </ref>). In the randomized potential field approach, a heuristic function is defined on the configuration space that attempts to steer the robot toward the goal through gradient descent. If the search becomes trapped in a local minimum, random walks are used to help escape.

These results enable a system to be driven from one configuration to another, and generally apply to driftless systems that are nilpo-tentizable (a condition on the underlying Lie algebra). In general, however, the connection problem can again be as difficult as designing a nonlinear controller.

Reference-contexts: The vast majority of basic path planning algorithms consider only kinematics, while ignoring the system dynamics entirely. Motion planning that takes into account dynamic constraints as well as kinematic constraints is known as kinodynamic planning <ref> [10] </ref>. In this paper, we consider kinodynamic planning as a generalization of holonomic and nonholonomic planning in configuration spaces, by replacing popular configuration-space notions by their state space (or phase space) counterparts. <p> These concerns provide the general basis for kinody-namic planning research. Algebraic approaches solve for the trajectory exactly, though the only known solutions are for point masses with velocity and acceleration bounds in one-dimension [19] and two-dimensions [5].

Finding an exact time-optimal trajectory for a point mass with bounded acceleration and velocity moving amidst polyhedral obstacles in 3D has been proven to be NP-hard <ref> [10] </ref>. The need for simple, efficient algorithms for kin-odynamic planning, along with the discouraging lower-bound complexity results, have motivated us to explore the development of randomized techniques for kinody-namic planning.

Reference-contexts: For the first complication, approximate nearest neighbor techniques <ref> [14] </ref> can be employed to help improve performance; it is not crucial to have the absolute closest neighbor. The second complication can make it harder to wander through narrow passageways, much like in the case of randomized roadmaps.

Reference-contexts: One idea for further investigation might be to construct RRTs to find initial trajectories, and then employ a variational technique to optimize the trajectories (see, for example, <ref> [28] </ref>). We are currently exploring the use of RRTs for other problems, such as kinodynamic planning for automobiles).
