Abstract: In automated negotiation systems consisting of self-interested agents, contracts have traditionally been binding, i.e., impossible to breach. Such contracts do not allow the agents to act efficiently upon future events. A leveled commitment protocol allows the agents to decommit from contracts by paying a monetary penalty to the contracting partner. The efficiency of such protocols depends heavily on how the penalties are decided. In this paper, different leveled commitment protocols and their parameterizations are empirically compared to each other and to several full commitment protocols. Many different aspects of contracting are studied, such as social welfare achieved, CPU-time usage, and amount of contracting and decommitting.

Results To compare the different contract types, the mean ratio bounds and the significance of the difference in ratio bounds were computed so the results could be statistically analyzed (in paired t-tests <ref> [6] </ref>). The description below concerns a fixed number of agents and a fixed number of tasks, but each such experiment was conducted for all combinations of agents (2..8) and tasks (2..8).

Reference-contexts: This leveled commitment protocol offers Pareto improvements over full commitment protocols and can make contracts individually rational to both parties even in cases where full commitment contracts cannot. The concept of breaching contracts in the real world is analyzed by Posner <ref> [9] </ref>. His main ideas are that the party that breaches must compensate the other party for lost profit and that the penalties for breaching contracts should be set so that the social welfare is maximized.

Reference-contexts: In contingency contracts the obligations of the contracts are made conditional on future events, which can increase the expected payoff of both parties, enabling contracts that are impossible via full commitment <ref> [10] </ref>. However, it is necessary to anticipate, enumerate, and monitor all future events, and the associated complexity can be high. Recently, a leveled commitment protocol has been proposed, which allows self-interested agents to decom-mit from a contract by simply paying a decommitment penalty to the contract partner [14].
