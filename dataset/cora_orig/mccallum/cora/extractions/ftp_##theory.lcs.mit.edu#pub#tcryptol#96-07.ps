Abstract: In Eurocrypt'94 we proposed a a new type of cryptographic scheme, which can decode concealed images without any cryptographic computations, by placing two transparencies on top of each other and using the decoder's (human) visual systems. One of the drawback of that proposal was a loss in contrast: a black pixel is translated in the reconstruction into a black region, but a white pixel is translated into a grey region (half black and half white). In this paper we propose am alternative model for reconstruction with a different set of operation (which we call the "Cover" semi-group) is proposed. In this model we are able to obtain a better contrast than is possible in the previous one. We prove tight bounds on the contrast as a function of the complexity of the scheme. We also show that for constracting k-out-n secret sharing schemes when n k 3 the new method is not applicable. fl Part of this work was done while the authors where visiting the Newton Institute, Cambridge.

Reference-contexts: However, each user's sheets must contain red, yellow and transparent pixels. In Section 4 we prove that these constructions are optimal with respect to the number of sheets used as a function of the contrast. 2 In the Eurocrypt'94 paper (as well as in <ref> [1] </ref>) this basic model was extended into a visual variant of the k-out-of-n secret sharing problem: given a written message, we would like to generate n transparencies so that the original message is visible if any k (or more) of them are stacked together, but totally invisible if fewer than k <p> This leaves the possibility of secret sharing scheme over other access structures, as was considered in <ref> [1] </ref>. Note, however, that from the impossibility of 3-out-of-3 secret sharing it follows that the DNF representation of the access structure cannot contain a disjunction of three different variables.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In Eurocrypt'94 <ref> [2] </ref> we considered the problem of encrypting images (printed text, handwritten notes, pictures, etc.) in a perfectly secure way which can be decoded directly by the human visual system. <p> We choose red and yellow so as do avoid confusion with the black and white colours of <ref> [2] </ref>. 1 top R Y T bottom R R Y R T R Y T Unlike the "Or" semi-group, the "Cover" semi-group is non-commutative and hence the order on which the transparencies are stacked is significant. <p> As in <ref> [2] </ref>, we map each pixel separately. Each pixel in the original image is mapped into c subpixels (it is best when the c subpixels can be arranged in a square, but it is not necessary; any other method of tiling is acceptable). <p> For 1 j; k n, party j receives for the kth copy the following: if hk; ji = 0, then the share of party I and if hk; ji = 1 the share of party II where hk; ji is the inner product over GF <ref> [2] </ref> of the bit vector representations of j and k. Since each copy is perfectly secure there is no problem with respect to the security. <p> We can obtain a similar contrast by using pair-wise small-bias probability spaces (as suggested in <ref> [2] </ref>) and this requires the number of pixels to be only O (c log n). 6 Open Problems We have shown the inapplicability of the Cover semi-group for k-out-of-n secret sharing schemes. This leaves the possibility of secret sharing scheme over other access structures, as was considered in [1].
