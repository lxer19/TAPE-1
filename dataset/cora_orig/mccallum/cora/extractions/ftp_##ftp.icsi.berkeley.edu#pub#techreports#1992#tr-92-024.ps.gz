Abstract: Optical interconnection networks, in which each processor contains a set of lasers for communication with other processors, have long been studied. In the "regular optics" model of Murdocca [5] a bounded number of planar mirrors are used to redirect light beams, and each processor has a bounded number of lasers directed at a fixed set of angles, independent of the processor. It is theoretically interesting to ignore diffraction, and assume that lasers beams travel in a straight line. In the regular optical model, we present elegant layouts for processor networks including the shu*e, grids, and Margulis' expander graph. We also disprove the existence of a certain kind of 3-dimensional layout for shu*es. Using slightly more complicated optical devices, such as beam splitters, we design a "light guide," which allows simultaneous broadcasts, subject only to the limitations of light sensors. In particular, the light guide can perform single broadcasts. Given accurate enough clocks, it can perform arbitrary permutations.

Reference-contexts: We call this the shu*e-unshu*e network. Using four conical mirrors, Cohen and Rajagopalan <ref> [1] </ref> have shown how to lay out (x; y) ! (2x mod n; 2y mod n) with lasers pointing in the z direction.

Reference-contexts: The number of processors can be any even number. 1 As an interconnection network, the shu*e exchange has been implemented opti-cally [5], though the implementation involves a beam splitter and 50% loss of energy. The shu*e exchange processor network has also been implemented with holograms <ref> [2] </ref>. We will lay out the shu*e exchange processor network elegantly, without energy loss, using mirrors rather than more complicated optics. We will place the processors in a line.

Reference-contexts: If the processors are numbered in row major order, then the shu*e connection is a dilation of each quadrant of the square. A 4 3 6 4 1 0 5 dilation can be performed using lenses or a central projection. For example, Stirk et al [8] and Lohman <ref> [3] </ref> use lenses to implement the shu*e as a processor-memory interconnect. In this section we consider whether such a layout is possible using only lasers and mirrors. The natural 3-dimensional generalization of our 2-dimensional layout permits us to shu*e along either dimension.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Good introductions to optical computing can be found in <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Lasers can be made very small and very fast, and experimental technology is improving rapidly. <p> We find that the formulas are simpler mathematically if we number the processors starting from 0.

Reference-contexts: The tradeoff is that the laser beams travel closer and closer together. 876 5 43 2 1 3. Margulis' Expander Expander graphs have good communication properties and are also suited to certain algorithms. Paturi et al <ref> [6] </ref> describe several applications of expanders and implement a layout in their optoelectronic model, which uses holograms. In this section we describe a regular layout using mirrors. Margulis' expander graph contains processors numbered (x; y) for 0 x; y &lt; n.

Reference-contexts: Under a reasonable restriction, we show that the standard processor placement does not permit a layout of the shu*e connections. Recall that Reif <ref> [7] </ref> has shown that if light may reflect an unbounded number of times then the destination may be undecidable. Furthermore it is known that a light beam projected at a random angle in a square traces out a dense set.
