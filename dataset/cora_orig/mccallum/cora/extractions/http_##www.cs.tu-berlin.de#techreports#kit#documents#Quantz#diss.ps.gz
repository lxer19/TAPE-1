Reference-contexts: Alternative psycho-linguistic theories, on the other hand, claim the impact of lexical semantics in the parsing process. According to these theories, specific lexical information (e.g. about the probable complements of a head) is used to determine the first syntactic analysis assigned to a phrase <ref> [Ka-plan, Bresnan 82, Abney 89, Konieczny 89] </ref>: (4.17) a.

Reference-contexts: Such a theory has been developed in <ref> [Aczel 88] </ref> (see also [Barwise, Etchemendy 87, Ch. 3] for a concise summary). Note that this theory not only allows a straightforward treatment of paradoxes but is also necessary for the representation of self-referential or circular though non-paradoxical propositions.

Reference-contexts: I will deal with some of them in Chapter 6. Furthermore, I did not address the issue of parsing in Unification Grammars. Carpenter formalizes interpretation in HPSG by generalizing At-Kaci's work on constraint systems <ref> [At-Kaci 86] </ref>. An HPSG can be modeled by a constraint system, and interpretation of an expression is then obtained by computing the resolutions to a query encoding the expression [Carpenter 92, Chap. 15]. <p> Though the interpretation algorithm presented in the next section is neither purely deductive nor abductive, it is in principle based on these approaches and understanding them will help in understanding the next section.

An HPSG can be modeled by a constraint system, and interpretation of an expression is then obtained by computing the resolutions to a query encoding the expression [Carpenter 92, Chap. 15]. Instead of following Carpenter's approach, I will rather formalize interpretation in terms of DL entailment.

Reference-contexts: This principle thus embodies the idea underlying Categorial Grammar, namely that signs can be categorized as functors and arguments whose combination yields signs belonging to some category <ref> [Ajdukiewicz 35] </ref>. For example, an intransitive verb like `runs' can be categorized as S=N P , i.e. as a functor yielding a sentence when combined with a noun phrase.

Reference-contexts: Thus in the following I will always use the term sentence in the sense of text-sentence, unless indicated otherwise (the same holds for the term expression). Finally, I will distinguish two subtasks of text representation (see [Woods 81, p. 312ff], <ref> [Allen 87, p. 9] </ref> and [Jackendoff 87, Chap. 4] for similar distinctions): 1. How can the information contained in and related to a text be formally rep resented? I call this the representation task. 2. <p> Finally, the contextual interpretation phase maps the syntactic and logical forms into a final representation of the effects of understanding 2.2.

Reference-contexts: In order to capture this kind of information the integration of probabilistic rules [Heinsohn, Owsnicki-Klewe 88, Heinsohn 91] and of defaults <ref> [Baader, Hollunder 92, Quantz, Royer 92, Baader, Hollunder 93] </ref> was suggested.

And in the default extensions of DL the defaults are only used to derive additional descriptions but not subsumptions, i.e. fl can only have the form o :: c (see <ref> [Quantz, Royer 92, Baader, Hollunder 92] </ref>). 10 In order to translate heterogeneous approaches into homogeneous ones, Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor introduced j~ as an object-level connective (j~ is often used as a meta-level symbol for default entailment). Intuitively, ff j~ fi says that fi is a plausible consequence of ff.

A TECHNICAL VIEW ON AMBIGUITY 77 The second common strategy towards ambiguity is to construct multiple structures representing the alternative representations.

Reference-contexts: One of the most obvious applications of NLP is Machine Translation (MT), i.e. the task of automatically translating this text into another natural language. Note that in addition to fully automatic high quality translation <ref> [Bar-Hillel 64] </ref>, which is beyond the scope of current state of the art in MT, there are a number of possibilities in which a computer system can support a human translator: providing lexical information, idiomatic translations, sample translations, syntactic analyses, encyclopedic information, etc.
Reference: [Barwise 89] <editor> J. Barwise, </editor> <booktitle> The Situation in Logic, Stanford: CSLI Lecture Notes 17, </booktitle> <year> 1989 </year>
Reference-contexts: According to Barwise, the key insight of situation semantics is that speech, writing, thought, and inference are situated activities <ref> [Barwise 89, p. xii] </ref>. As a consequence of this seemingly trivial remark, Barwise and Perry suggest to see meanings as relations between (types of) situations, namely, between the discourse or utterance situation and the situation described by an utterance [Barwise, Perry 83, pp. 6&14]. <p> Jackendoff proposes preference rule systems to deal with prototype effects in linguistic phenomena [Jack-endoff 83, Chap. 8]. Another interesting cognitive motivation is given by Barwise's notion of conditional constraints: Most constraints to which we are attuned do not apply to every situation, but only under certain conditions <ref> [Barwise 89, p. 120] </ref>. Barwise calls these conditions background.

Reference-contexts: We thus obtain the first two characteristics of situation semantics: 1. Situations are full-fledged members of the ontology (like individuals, prop erties, etc.). 2. Situations are partial. The impact of these assumptions for a semantic theory can be grasped by looking at the treatment of propositions in <ref> [Barwise, Etchemendy 87] </ref>, an excellent, self contained presentation, which is much more accessible than [Barwise, Perry 83]. 3.3. <p> Max; 3|; 1]) which can be roughly paraphrased as `the situation described is such that in it Max has the three of clubs': on the Austinian view (...) there is always (...) at least one contextu ally sensitive feature of the utterance, namely, the situation the propo sition is about. <ref> [Barwise, Etchemendy 87, p. 121] </ref> The basic constituents of the proposition in (5) are a situation and an infon. <p> and Etchemendy give several examples for infon algebras in [Barwise, Etchemendy 90] and show that most interesting infon algebras are Heyting algebras, but not Boolean alge bras. 7 I here use the notation for proposition (s : ) from [Barwise, Etchemendy 90] instead of the original notation fs; g from <ref> [Barwise, Etchemendy 87] </ref>. 60 CHAPTER 3. LOGIC-BASED FORMALISMS 2. Since situation theory treats infons, situations, and propositions as full-fledged objects, they can also occur as constituents of other infons, situations, and propositions. <p> Such a theory has been developed in [Aczel 88] (see also <ref> [Barwise, Etchemendy 87, Ch. 3] </ref> for a concise summary). Note that this theory not only allows a straightforward treatment of paradoxes but is also necessary for the representation of self-referential or circular though non-paradoxical propositions.

Reference-contexts: DL and UG have thus been worked out considerably, whereas Situation Theory and Nonmonotonic Reasoning (NMR) are still in a phase of development. Situation Theory was proposed as a general theory for representing information, but there is still no complete axiomatization (cf. <ref> [Barwise, Etchemendy 90] </ref>) and no implementation. Similarly, research in NMR has produced many theoretical results on reasoning with incomplete or defeasible information but is still lacking implemented systems which are used in realistic applications. 40 3.1. <p> There are three important aspects of infons, propositions, and situation types: 1. Infons can be combined and follow from each other, which can be formalized by the notion of infon algebras. Barwise and Etchemendy give several examples for infon algebras in <ref> [Barwise, Etchemendy 90] </ref> and show that most interesting infon algebras are Heyting algebras, but not Boolean alge bras. 7 I here use the notation for proposition (s : ) from [Barwise, Etchemendy 90] instead of the original notation fs; g from [Barwise, Etchemendy 87]. 60 CHAPTER 3. LOGIC-BASED FORMALISMS 2. <p> Barwise and Etchemendy give several examples for infon algebras in <ref> [Barwise, Etchemendy 90] </ref> and show that most interesting infon algebras are Heyting algebras, but not Boolean alge bras. 7 I here use the notation for proposition (s : ) from [Barwise, Etchemendy 90] instead of the original notation fs; g from [Barwise, Etchemendy 87]. 60 CHAPTER 3. LOGIC-BASED FORMALISMS 2. Since situation theory treats infons, situations, and propositions as full-fledged objects, they can also occur as constituents of other infons, situations, and propositions. <p> Let us examine the infon algebras first. I will not go into the formal details here, but rather sketch the basic ideas as presented in detail in <ref> [Barwise, Etchemendy 90] </ref>. In order to capture the logical entailment between infons it is said that involves t , written ) t , if t logically follows from .

Reference-contexts: Or, for short, meaning underdetermines interpretation. <ref> [Barwise, Perry 83, p.36f] </ref> A similar distinction has been proposed as the two-level theory of semantic interpretation [Bierwisch 83]. <p> In a sequel, Situation Semantics, we plan to present a rigorously developed semantics for a large fragment of English, with little attention to philosophical issues. <ref> [Barwise, Perry 83, p. x] </ref> This sequel has never appeared, however. <p> As a consequence of this seemingly trivial remark, Barwise and Perry suggest to see meanings as relations between (types of) situations, namely, between the discourse or utterance situation and the situation described by an utterance <ref> [Barwise, Perry 83, pp. 6&14] </ref>. Note that this is indeed different from Frege, who claimed that the meaning (Bedeutung) of a sentence is its truth-value. <p> Situations are partial. The impact of these assumptions for a semantic theory can be grasped by looking at the treatment of propositions in [Barwise, Etchemendy 87], an excellent, self contained presentation, which is much more accessible than <ref> [Barwise, Perry 83] </ref>. 3.3. <p> Since it can be the case that neither s j= nor s j= , the proposition (s : ) _ (s : ) is not tautological. Hence, certain problems arising in the context of the principle of substitutivity (see <ref> [Barwise, Perry 83, p. 173ff] </ref>) are avoided. Let us now address the issue of nonwellfoundedness. In our examples above, infons consisted of relations (e.g., `Has') which took as their arguments ordinary objects (e.g., `Max' or `3|'). <p> Thus additional information does not make any conclusions invalid. Nonmonontonic Reasoning (NMR) on the contrary is concerned with exactly those situations in which additional information can invalidate conclusions, i.e., 0 and j= NM fl does not guarantee 8 In the following I use Devlin's terminology [Devlin 91]. In <ref> [Barwise, Perry 83] </ref> parameters were called indeterminates and in [Israel, Perry 90] the term `infon' is reserved for parametric states of affairs, where states of affairs correspond to Devlin's notion of infons. 3.4. NONMONOTONIC REASONING 63 0 j= NM fl. <p> What is obviously intended by this notion is that if s 1 s 2 then o :: c in s 1 implies o :: c in s 2 . Note that this is called persistence in the context of Situation Semantics <ref> [Barwise, Perry 83] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In spite of these mechanisms object-level reasoning is still rather time-consuming which has considerable impact on the performance of the preferential algorithm for interpretation presented in Section 7.4. The most promising solution to this efficiency problem consists in a parallelization of propagation as described in <ref> [Bergmann, Quantz 95] </ref>. 7.2 Computing Default Spaces In this section I briefly describe an algorithm implementing the proof theory for weighted defaults developed in Section 5.3. The basic functionality of this algorithm is to compute default situations with minimal score from a given situation.

Bouma's default unification unifies strict information with defeasible information <ref> [Bouma 90] </ref>, Horty and Thomason integrate strict and defeasible inheritance [Horty, Thomason 88], and Quantz and Royer integrate defaults into DL, which behave like ordinary DL implications except that they allow for exceptions [Quantz, Royer 92].

In addition, he proposes KL-ONE as a formalism on the epistemological level and presents its basic elements or epistemological primitives.

In the late 1980's several results were obtained concerning the tractability of different DLs. In order to understand these results we now have to take a closer look on the theoretical foundations of DL.

The respective formalisms and systems were called KL-ONE alike systems, term subsumption systems, concept logics, terminological logics, and description logics. <p> In the first half of the 1980's several systems were developed that might be called in retrospection first-generation DL systems. These systems include KL-ONE <ref> [Brachman, Schmolze 85] </ref>, NIKL [Schmolze, Mark 91], KANDOR [Patel-Schneider 84], KL-TWO [Vilain 85], KRYPTON [Brachman et al. 83], ME SON [Edelmann, Owsnicki 86], and SB-ONE [Kobsa 89]. In the second half of the 1980's three systems were developed which are still in use, namely BACK, CLASSIC, and LOOM. <p> This very general scenario can be refined by considering generic application tasks such as information retrieval, diagnosis, or configuration. Extending Description Logics Research in DL was originally concerned with the set of epistemological primitives presented in <ref> [Brachman, Schmolze 85] </ref>, but the interest in extending DL to integrate results from other fields of AI increased considerably in the last years. The integration of rule-based reasoning into DL was suggested very early in [Owsnicki-Klewe 88].
