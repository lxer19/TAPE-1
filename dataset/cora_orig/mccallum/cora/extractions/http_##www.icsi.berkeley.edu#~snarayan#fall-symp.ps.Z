Reference-contexts: Such observations have resulted in proposals that abstract reason is grounded in recurring patterns of experience called Image Schemas <ref> (Lakoff 1987) </ref>. However, the work in Cognitive Semantics lacks any computational model for such theories, and consequently such ideas cannot currently be used in natural language understanding or problem solving systems.

Reference-contexts: Details of the various aspects of the design and implementation and connections to the larger NTL project under way at UC Berkeley and ICSI can be obtained from the web site http:://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/NTL or from <ref> (Narayanan 1997) </ref>. 2 Motivation Consider the following paragraph that appeared in the NYT in August, 1995. In 1991, in response to World Bank pressure, India boldly set out on a path of liberalization. The government loosened its strangle-hold on business, and removed obstacles to international trade. <p> I will only attempt a crude description of the interpretation process in this abstract. Further information can be obtained from <ref> (Narayanan 1997) </ref> The central hypothesis pursued here is that the meaning of embodied causal terms is grounded in patterns generated by our sensory and motor systems as we interact in the world. <p> We have built a computational model of x-schemas that satisfies these requirements. The model is a variant of high-level Petri Nets (Reisig 1985). Extensions include the use of parameters and individuated tokens. Technical details of our representation can be found in <ref> (Narayanan 1997) </ref>. "falling into holes". When active, the "fall into hole" x-schema executes and returns bindings that specify the state of the agent falling into the hole. For instance, at the end of the fall, the agent is in the hole, is injured, and has a goal to get out. <p> Aspect which relates to how the inherent aspect of a verb (such as the inherent iterativity of the verb tap) interacts with grammaticalized aspect such as the X-ing construction to produce the proper inferences (tapping involves repeated taps, in contrast to climbing or walking). in model-theoretic and other traditional accounts <ref> (Narayanan 1997) </ref>. To extend the model to causal narrative interpretation, we assume that the reader's epistemic state consists of a set of features each of which can take on one of a discrete set of values with varying degrees of belief. <p> These were developed using a database of around 30 2 3 line newspaper stories all of which have been successfully interpreted by the program. The database of stories used during program development and the full I/O behavior of the implemented system can be found in <ref> (Narayanan 1997) </ref>. In summary, our results suggest that a large proportion of commonplace descriptions of abstract events project familiar motion and manipulation concepts onto more abstract domains such as economics and politics.

Reference-contexts: To extend the model to causal narrative interpretation, we assume that the reader's epistemic state consists of a set of features each of which can take on one of a discrete set of values with varying degrees of belief. Our implementation uses a temporally extended probabilistic network <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref>. Linguistic input and world knowledge jointly condition the reader's epistemic state by clamping features to specific values. In future discussion, we will refer to these feature value pairs as f-structs.

Reference-contexts: They should also be capable of modeling asynchronous event-based control with interrupts. We have built a computational model of x-schemas that satisfies these requirements. The model is a variant of high-level Petri Nets <ref> (Reisig 1985) </ref>. Extensions include the use of parameters and individuated tokens. Technical details of our representation can be found in (Narayanan 1997). "falling into holes". When active, the "fall into hole" x-schema executes and returns bindings that specify the state of the agent falling into the hole.
