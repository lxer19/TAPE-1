Abstract: The estimation of signal stable ranges in a combinational circuit is very critical for determining clock time in a synchronous system. How to determine an optimal clocking period highly depends on the accuracy of the estimated shortest path length as well as the estimated longest path length in a combinational circuit. In this paper, a sensitization criterion for short paths is first proposed. Based on this sensitization criterion, an approach to calculating signal stable ranges is developed. The proposed approach allows the output stable range of a gate to be the union of the stable ranges of its input-leads in some cases. An efficient algorithm called LS-algorithm based on the proposed approach and Best-First Search is implemented. The experimental results obtained indicate the stable ranges generated by the LS-algorithm is more accurate than those produced by several previous approaches.

Reference-contexts: Using their approach, we implemented an algorithm called InterSection-algorithm (IS-algorithm) to compute the stable ranges. Note that the output SR of a gate is simply the intersection of the SRs at its input-leads, provided that we take the time interval contributed by the false paths to be <ref> [1; +1] </ref>. If L I (S I ) is defined as the longest (shortest) functionable path corresponding to the SR obtained by the IS-algorithm, L I (S I ) may be shorter (longer) than L S (S S ). <p> Each lead e in the circuit assumes an unstable range [e; t 0 ; t 1 ], which means that the unstable time of signal i (i = "0"="1") at lead e must not be later than t i . The initial unstable range at each lead e is <ref> [e; 1; 1] </ref>. Later, it will be constrained more as the sensitization requirements are added. <p> Furthermore, the range <ref> [e; 1; 1] </ref>, representing that neither "0" nor "1" can be assigned to e, is called an inconsistency. The algorithm needs two rounds to discover a short f alse path. The first round imposes events (PI,"0",0) and (PI,"1",1) at the beginning of the given path. <p> It clearly shows that the IS-algorithm sacrifices the accuracy by choosing only one interval from those leads which hold controlling values at a gate, since the others are blocked and assigned range as <ref> [1; +1] </ref>. However, the LS-algorithm can get the union and allow to enlarge the range as much as possible. Now, we generalize the input stable range as [t i ; T i ] at each primary input P I i . <p> Therefore, we implemented the three variations of the IS-algorithm based on a depth-first approach. The paths are traced one by one and the stable range of each lead along the path is also updated one by one. A similar approach used in <ref> [1] </ref>. Every time the algorithm shifts to trace to a new path baed on the depth -first approach.

Reference-contexts: However, the static-approach is usually too conservative because some statically longest path may never be activated by any given input vector. Brand and Iyengar proposed a functional timing analysis <ref> [3] </ref> to discover these un-sensitizable paths which are called false paths. Using their approach, we implemented an algorithm called InterSection-algorithm (IS-algorithm) to compute the stable ranges. <p> For example, the LS-algorithm is about 70 times faster than the IS-algorithm for c1355. This is due to the fact that the LS-algorithm can avoid the exhaustive search and only needs to search for the longest (shortest) sensitizable path by using the BFS approach. The original IS-algorithm proposed in <ref> [3] </ref> uses recursive calls and the sensitization conditions along all traced partial paths must be maintained for later use. This is too space consuming to be implemented. Therefore, we implemented the three variations of the IS-algorithm based on a depth-first approach. <p> In the LS-algorithm, two phases are used to find a beginning point and an ending point of stable ranges for each primary output. The proposed approach is also different from the previously proposed approach <ref> [3] </ref> in where the stable range at the output of a gate is always the intersection of the stable ranges at its input-leads. In the proposed approach the stable range at the output of a gate may be the union of the stable ranges at its input-leads.
