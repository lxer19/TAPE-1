Title: Determination of Social Laws for Multi-Agent Mobilization  
Author: Shmuel Onn and Moshe Tennenholtz

Abstract: In previous work on artificial social systems, social laws for multi-agent mobilization were hand-crafted for particular network structures. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for the automatic synthesis of social laws for multi-agent mobilization in any 2-connected graph environment. We introduce the notion of a graph routing and show that the problem of computing a useful social law can be reduced to that of finding a routing in a graph. Then we show that any given 2-connected graph has a routing which can be efficiently constructed, yielding the desired social law for multi-agent mobilization on the given graph.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we consider only simple graphs those which contain neither loops nor parallel edges. We now briefly recall some basic graph-theoretic terminology which we shall need (see <ref> [BM76] </ref> for details). A cut-vertex in a graph is one whose removal leaves the graph disconnected. A block is a graph containing no cut-vertex. A graph is 2-connected if it is a block and has at least three vertices.

Reference-contexts: The notion of graph routing introduced in this paper and our algorithm suggest that certain classes of polytopal graphs (such as those studied in <ref> [DO95, KO92, Onn93] </ref>) may provide network structures over which particularly efficient social laws can be synthesized. Our article is organized as follows. In Section 3 we discuss multi-robot networks, which are a general model for agent mobilization, and define (useful) social laws in the context of this model. <p> Another issue to be addressed concerns situations where the structure of the underlying graph is part of the design. The above discussion and the superiority of graphs with low diameter suggest that a good source of graphs may be provided by certain classes of polytopal graphs (see e.g. <ref> [DO95, KO92, Onn93] </ref>). 5 Discussion The study presented in this paper refers to point robots. Although this may be a reasonable assumption in illustrating the artificial social systems approach, one may wish to relax this assumption.

Reference-contexts: The artificial social systems approach is also much different from the more centralized approach to the control of multiple robots as well as from decentralized approaches in this regard (e.g., <ref> [Buc89, ELP87] </ref>.) 2 In our study we have assumed that the agents may change their velocity, while ignoring the need for acceleration and deceleration. This is quite typical for work on the theory of AGVs, where agents are assumed to stop and reinitiate their movement without any cost [Gro88]. <p> The emphasis of our study is on a general automatic procedure for the generation of social laws which guarantee goal achievements and no collisions for the whole family of 2-connected graphs. Notice that in other decentralized approaches, where paths are calculated in a decentralized fashion (e.g., <ref> [ELP87] </ref>) there is no guarantee that the goals of the agents will be actually obtained. Given that our results are obtained for the case of agents which operate with minimal communication and sensing abilities, we believe our results to be more applicable than previously established results in this regard.

Reference-contexts: Notice that the 2-connectivity assumption is quite popular in such settings as well. Moreover, when the system is not 2-connected the approach is to increase the connectivity of the network in order to yield this (and higher) level of connectivity <ref> [ET76] </ref>. Our work adopts the artificial social systems approach for the coordination of multi-agent systems and shows how it can be applied to yield coordinated and useful behavior in the related models.

Reference-contexts: The multi-robot networks are general models where one may 2 discuss the coordination of multi-agent systems. In particular, these models include the models discussed in the Automated Guided Vehicles [AGVs] literature (see <ref> [Gro88, Sin95] </ref> for some overview of the related literature).

IR. <p> This is quite typical for work on the theory of AGVs, where agents are assumed to stop and reinitiate their movement without any cost <ref> [Gro88] </ref>. Nevertheless, our study can take into account acceleration and deceleration by allowing the agents to accelerate and decelerate while taking care that they will not collide in spite of these processes. <p> This gives another advantage over previous general techniques for multi-robot path planning, which have been either intractable or tailored for very particular domains. In this paper we concentrated on mobilization of physical entities in 2-connected graphs, which are the settings where Automated Guided Vehicles (see <ref> [Gro88, Sin95] </ref>) are discussed. Similar ideas can be used for agent mobilization in other contexts, such as communication networks. Notice that the 2-connectivity assumption is quite popular in such settings as well.

The social system approach superficially resembles some more classical path planning techniques such as quad-trees and cell decomposition. <p> This situation may occur for example where there is a short edge uv in the graph, where the difference between the labels (generated by our algorithm) of u and v is large. This point should be addressed by considering the properties of the rooting algorithm for 2 In <ref> [Lat91a] </ref> the idea of traffic/social laws is discussed in the context of other techniques for path planning in multi-agent systems. In a centralized approach robots are treated as a single entity that moves in a composite space, while in a decentralized approach each robot treats the others as moving obstacles.

Notice that the mobilization of AGVs is usually discussed in the context of 2-connected graphs <ref> [Sin95] </ref>. A second question is whether it is possible to automatically and efficiently synthesize the appropriate routings. The answer is positive: our proof that any 2-connected graph has a routing is constructive and provides a simple polytime algorithm for the automatic synthesis of a routing for any given 2-connected graph. <p> There are several approaches to the coordination of physically moving entities.
