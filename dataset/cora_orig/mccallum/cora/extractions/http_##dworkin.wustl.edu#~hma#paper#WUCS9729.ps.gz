Abstract: This paper estimates the link costs of constraint based nonblocking ATM networks on a sphere. Analytical results are obtained when switches are uniformly distributed on the surface of a unit sphere and every switch has source and sink capacity of one, and the results are compared with simulations.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Integrated network technologies, such as ATM, supports multimedia applications with vastly different bandwidth needs, connection request rates, and holding patterns, and makes traditional network planning techniques less relevant. A constraint-based network design model <ref> [1] </ref> is proposed, which can help create networks that can handle any combination of traffic that lies within user-specified constraints. Previous research has shown the hardness of network design problem [2, 3, 4], and a network design tool is implemented in Java to help design networks on a Euclidian plane [1]. <p> <ref> [1] </ref> is proposed, which can help create networks that can handle any combination of traffic that lies within user-specified constraints. Previous research has shown the hardness of network design problem [2, 3, 4], and a network design tool is implemented in Java to help design networks on a Euclidian plane [1]. Because of the importance of global ATM networks, this paper studies the costs of constraint-based ATM networks on a sphere. In the simplest case, switches are uniformly distributed on the surface of a unit sphere, and the source and sink capacity of every switch is equal to one.
