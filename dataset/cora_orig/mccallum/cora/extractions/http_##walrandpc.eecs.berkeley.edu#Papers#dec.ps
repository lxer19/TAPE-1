Abstract: UCB/ERL Technical Report M93/50 Submitted to IEEE/ACM Trans. Networking Abstract We consider large buffer asymptotics for feed-forward networks of discrete-time queues with deterministic service rate shared by multiple classes of streams subject to work conserving service policies. First we review the concept of effective bandwidths for traffic streams sharing a common buffer subject to subject to tail constraints on the workload distribution. Next, we obtain the effective bandwidth of the departure process from such a queue, proving that in fact the effective bandwidth of the output is at worst equal to that of the input, and depending on the service rate, strictly less than that of the input. We then define the notion of a decoupling bandwidth and the associated constraints, guaranteeing that asymptotics within the network are decoupled. These results provide a framework for call admission schemes which are sensitive to constraints on the tail distribution of the workload or approximate cell loss probabilities. Our results require relatively weak assumptions on both the traffic streams and service policies. We consider the problem of "optimal" traffic shaping (via buffering) subject to a loss constraint. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of resource management for ATM networks.

Further cases where LDPs hold can be found in <ref> [13] </ref>. For example, coordinate functions of Markov chains satisfying strong uniformity conditions on the transition kernel and tail will satisfy an LDP, see [14]. <p> D 1 whence for ffi 0 we have fl D (ffi) = sup ffED 1 [ffffi I (ff)]: Proof: The service rate is c, so S D n nc, and it follows that lim sup 1 log E exp [ffiS D n ] &lt; 1: Now applying Theorem 4.5.10 in <ref> [13] </ref>, we can conclude that the limit fl D (ffi) exists, is finite, and since the rate function is unique fl fl D (ff) = I (ff) for ff E D 1 . <p> We state the theorem subject to these conditions in order to avoid technical details, however, they are much more restrictive than necessary. Our proof relies on a large deviations result for the sample path process shown in Dembo and Zajic <ref> [13] </ref>. This result holds for a rather general class of Markov or mixing processes satisfying the technical assumptions discussed therein. <p> Proof: In order to use Theorem 3.1 we begin by identifying the rate function for the arrival process. The latter is an aggregate sum of independent sources. Thus Eq. 3 follows from the contraction principle and the rate functions' convexity, see Dembo and Zeitouni <ref> [13, page 110] </ref>. The result follows from Corollary 3.1 if we can show that the decoupling bandwidth of the aggregate arrivals is indeed additive. Let fl () denote the log moment generating function of the aggregate arrival stream. <p> consequence of the rate function's strict convexity. 16 A discussion of this result is beyond the scope of this paper, we refer the reader to the work of Asmussen [2] and Anantharam [1], for an investigation of the normalized partial sum paths of i.i.d. random variables, and Dembo and Zajic <ref> [13] </ref> for a general result, which we use here, predicated on the existence of sample path LDP. <p> 2 corresponding to the case where the partial sum path of stream 2 stays close to its mean arrival rate; this event is typically very likely to occur, in fact we have that lim 1 log P (E n ) = 0; by the LDP results in Dembo and Zajic <ref> [13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If this is the case then nodal decoupling constraints should suffice; moreover, these can be ensured by guaranteeing that the peak rate of individual streams is small relative to the total link capacity. Below we explore a conservative rule along these lines, see <ref> [23] </ref> for a simulation study. Consider the scenario shown in Figure 5: N streams of a given type share a buffer with capacity c and utilization . Assume all streams have an effective bandwidth ff (ffi) and decoupling bandwidth ff fl (ffi). <p> That is, the peak rate of a single stream should be no more than 10% of the link capacity if it is to incur no distortion through the queue. Extensive simulations in <ref> [23] </ref> confirm that such a relationship is indeed approximately true, where the output distortion is measured with respect to output statistics rather than effective bandwidth. <p> The number 2:9 was chosen arbitrarily to match the simulation results in <ref> [23] </ref>; roughly this indicates that if all the streams were transmitting at their "sustainable" peak rates the aggregate arrival rate would not exceed three times the capacity of the link. Typically we expect the worst case utilization might be larger than 2.9. <p> Typically we expect the worst case utilization might be larger than 2.9. In general the characteristics of the traffic and required performance constraints will determine both the achievable average and worst case utilizations and hence the required diversity. Once 14 again the simulation study of Lau and Li <ref> [23] </ref> suggests that nodal decoupling will indeed hold when diversity of 5% is maintained within a network. While guaranteeing decoupling may follow for free once an ATM network is managed to satisfy stringent performance constraints we should note that in practice nodal decomposition is likely to be a conservative approach.

The decoupling constraint Eq. 6 is sufficient but not necessary to guarantee that output's effective bandwidth is the same as that at the input. In fact the following example illustrates that it may be more conservative than necessary.

Reference-contexts: This validates resource management schemes based on nodal or virtual circuit isolation for a recent discussion see Towsley <ref> [28] </ref>. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In x2 we briefly introduce concepts and notation related to the theory of large deviations and review the notion of effective bandwidths for a single buffered queue.

Reference-contexts: An example with similar characteristics, is that of a Jackson network for which the steady state distribution is in fact product-form <ref> [29] </ref>. In this case the queue length distribution at queue i is geometric with a parameter i = i = i the ratio of the aggregate arrival intensity i to the service rate i of the queue. <p> This discussion is based on an earlier paper [12] which reviewed and extended some of the results in Kelly [21].

As in the single queue example there exists a stationary distribution, see Walrand <ref> [29, page 245] </ref>. Using our characterization for the stationary output process we discuss resource management for a simple scenario shown in Figure 3. <p> Acknowledgments: G. de Veciana would like to thank A. Dembo and N. O'Connell for many helpful comments. Appendix Outline of the proof for Theorem 3.1: The stability condition, E A 1 &lt; c, guarantees the existence of a stationary distribution, see Loynes [24] or Walrand <ref> [29, Chap. 7] </ref>. In particular, let W m W m n + A n+1 c] + n m; then the distribution of W m 0 converges monotonically to that of W where P (W &lt; 1) = 1.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, in [5] a heuristic set of non-linear equations are proposed to investigate quick simulation of network asymptotics. These ideas were extended in [8] where an optimization problem is proposed as a means to study tail distributions in in-tree networks. Yaron and Sidi <ref> [31] </ref> also present exponential upper bounds, suitable for establishing exponential stability of such networks when streams satisfy exponentially bounded burstiness conditions.
