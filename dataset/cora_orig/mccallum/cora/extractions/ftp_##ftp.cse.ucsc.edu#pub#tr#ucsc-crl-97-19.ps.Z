Abstract: This survey presents several techniques for solving variants of the following scattered data interpolation problem: given a finite set of N points in R 3 , find a surface that interpolates the given set of points. Problems of this variety arise in numerous areas of applications such as geometric modeling and scientific visualization. A large class of solutions exists for these problems and many excellent surveys exist as well. The focus of this survey is on presenting techniques that are relatively recent. Some discussion of two popular variants of the scattered data interpolation problem - trivariate (or volumetric) case and surface-on-surface is also included. Solutions are classified into one of the five categories: piecewise polynomial or rational parametric solutions, algebraic solutions, radial basis function methods, Shepard's methods and subdivision surfaces. Discussion on parametric solutions includes global interpolation by a single polynomial, interpolants based on data dependent triangulations, piecewise linear solutions such as alpha-shapes, and interpolants on irregular mesh. Algebraic interpolants based on cubic A-patches are described. Interpolants based on radial basis functions include Hardy's multi-quadrics, inverse multiquadrics and thin plate splines. Techniques for blending local solutions and natural neighbor interpolants are described as variations of Shepard's methods. Subdivision techniques include Catmull-Clark subdivision technique and its variants and extensions. A brief discussion on surface interrogation techniques and visualization techniques is also included.

Reference-contexts: Rescorla [Res87] uses a ninth degree patch due to Zen isek [Zen73], with 220 degrees of freedom and requiring derivatives as high as fourth order to be estimated. Clearly a simpler patch is required, and there are several alternatives. The Clough- Tocher patch can be extended to tetrahedra <ref> [Alf84] </ref> using piecewise polynomials of degree five, with four tetrahedra in the split. There is an extension of the Clough-Tocher patch to n-dimensions, by Worsey and Farin [WF87].

Reference-contexts: There are several ways to classify the solutions to scattered data interpolation problems, as is evident in the past surveys on this topic <ref> [Sch76, Fra82a, Alf89] </ref>. In this work, the class of solutions to the scattered data problem is classified into five categories based primarily on the form of the solution. The first category is the polynomial or piecewise continuous polynomial parametric solutions. <p> We refer the reader to [Pow90, Buh93, Har90] for radial basis function methods, to [Dyn92] for subdivision techniques, to [Baj92] for algebraic solutions, to [MLL + 92] for piecewise polynomial or rational parametric solutions to triangulated data and to <ref> [Sch76, Fra82a, BN84, Alf89, Nie93d, NF94, FH94] </ref> for polynomial and rational solutions as well as Shepard's methods and radial basis techniques. Nevertheless, we are not aware of any survey on scattered data interpolation techniques that attempts to cover all the five categories of solutions described in the previous paragraph. <p> A brief discussion on these two popular variations of the scattered data interpolation problem is included for 3 the sake of completeness. We refer the reader to <ref> [Alf89, Nie93d, ND91, NT94a, NT94b, Tve91] </ref> for scattered volumetric data modeling. Third, an attempt has been made to focus on relatively recent techniques of scattered data interpolation, although for the sake of completeness, brief descriptions or appropriate references for older techniques are presented. <p> The tensor product B-splines and NURBS are examples of solutions that belong to this category. 2.1 Function Reconstruction The literature on solutions to function reconstruction problem by piecewise polynomial and rational parametric functions is rich and many good surveys exist <ref> [Sch76, Fra82a, FN91, FHN93, Alf89, Far86, BFK84, Nie93d, Bar83] </ref>. In the category of polynomial and rational interpolants, most of these surveys emphasize construction of smooth interpolants. The presentation here is intended to be somewhat complementary to these surveys. <p> Other types of piecewise continuous polynomial and rational solutions based on constraints and based on the discretization of a transfinite interpolant have also been used <ref> [Nie74, Bar83, Nie79, NF84, Alf89] </ref>. The finite element spline solutions can also be viewed as solving the scattered data interpolation problem from the space of piecewise polynomials of a given degree with certain smoothness defined over the original triangulation or a refined triangulation. <p> Elements of these piecewise polynomial spaces are referred to as multivariate splines. A good source of references for studies related to the dimension of these multivariate splines and their applications to scattered data interpolation problem can be found in the survey article by Alfeld <ref> [Alf89] </ref>. Finite element solutions are examples of multivariate splines, where the splines have minimally supported basis functions. The property of minimal support in turn makes the interpolants local and of relatively higher degree than is possible by global interpolants in general.

Reference-contexts: Minimum norm network method has also been extended to surfaces that are at least C 2 differentiable [Pot92]. Recently, scattered data interpolants have been suggested on spheres and sphere-like surfaces based on spherical Bernstein-Bezier polynomials and their generalizations to spherical triangular B-splines <ref> [ANS96, PS95] </ref>. 3 Algebraic Solutions An alternative to the parametric solutions discussed in the previous section is to construct functions or surfaces in implicit form, that is, the function or the surface can be represented as the zero set of some function in R 3 .

Reference-contexts: One such damping function suggested by Franke-Little is for example i (x; y) = (1 r i h i ) + <ref> [Bar77] </ref>. The damping function therefore vanishes outside a disk of radius h i centered around the point x i . The interpolant can, however, be sensitive to the choice of the radius h i .

Reference-contexts: This technique, referred to as preconditioning, also enhances accuracy of multiquadric methods, but to a very limited extent. The proposed technique works for all conditionally positive definite functions of positive order. More recently, another technique has been proposed for efficient computation of multiquadric interpolants, although only for gridded data <ref> [Bax92] </ref>. A direct technique for evaluating a radial basis interpolant at one point is O (N ). Beatson, Newsam and Powell [BN92, Pow92a, Pow92b] have proposed techniques for fast evaluation of thin plate spline interpolants.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand it is not clear what is a good or appropriate way of specifying the underlying topology of the data other than an underlying mesh. However, important advances have been made in constructing a piecewise linear approximation to scattered data sets in R 3 <ref> [HDD + 92, HDD + 93, HDD + 94, BBX95] </ref>. The closest to a piecewise linear interpolant to scattered data sets is the concept of alpha-shape, which we discuss next. Alpha-Shapes: Alpha-shapes are a generalization of the convex hull of the scattered data points [EM94].

Reference-contexts: In addition, the added challenge is to construct an interpolant with low degree and with as few patches as possible. To overcome these difficulties several heuristics were suggested in the solutions proposed by Dahmen and Guo. More recently Bajaj and Xu <ref> [BCX94] </ref> have constructed algebraic surface patches referred to as A-patches that are guaranteed to be non-singular and single sheeted within each tetrahedron [BCX95]. Moreover they enumerate the exceptional situations encountered in building the network of tetrahedra surrounding the triangulation in R 3 and provide strategies for rectifying them.

Moreover, they use one cubic A-patch per face of the triangulation, except for two special cases where 3 patches per triangle are used.

Reference-contexts: Function-on-Surface Problem: We now briefly describe the extension of various approaches described in Section 2.3 to Shepard-type techniques for solving the problem of scattered data 35 interpolation on surfaces <ref> [BDL83, BPR87] </ref>. We present two different solutions using the bivariate approach described in Section 2.3. The first solution can be used to solve the problem on convex surfaces [BPR87]. The interpolant is defined as before by f (x) = P N i=1 w i (x)L i (x).

Reference-contexts: The construction of the final solution in terms of linear combinations of cardinal interpolants then depends upon the convergence of certain infinite series. Unfortunately, cardinal interpolation by radial basis functions for scattered data locations is in its infancy <ref> [BDL95, DR95] </ref>. However cardinal interpolation by radial basis functions when the data is prescribed on an infinite regular integer lattice is well understood.

Reference-contexts: Another type of multistage interpolant was proposed by Barnhill and Gregory <ref> [BG75] </ref>. Let P and Q be two linear operators such that the composition P Q is defined. The Boolean sum P Q is defined as P + Q P Q. The Boolean sum interpolant has (at least) the interpolation properties of P and the precision properties of Q.

Reference-contexts: Algebraic surfaces have been used to interpolate a given set of points, normals and algebraic space curves by choosing the degree of the algebraic surface sufficiently high in order to contain the given data <ref> [BI92a] </ref>. This approach typically constructs one algebraic surface to fit the given data and works well for surface blending applications, such as the smooth join of four cylinders with a quartic surface.

Reference-contexts: In fact, in other circumstances as well, even when h is allowed to vary discreetly, so that Gaussians do not satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions linking good convergence behavior with polynomial reproduction property, Gaussians also have a good convergence behavior <ref> [BL92] </ref>. Therefore, the most recent research seems to break down the "classical wisdom" that the advantage of a particular radial basis function be tied to its polynomial reproduction properties. We shall comment about this later again in this section when disussing radial basis functions with compact support.

Reference-contexts: However, after this initial set up cost, this leads to an evaluation algorithm which is O (1) per evaluation.

Reference-contexts: Improvements of multiquadric interpolant by using a linear combination of basis functions centered at the same point but with different values of the parameter have also been achieved <ref> [BM92] </ref>.

The key idea is to lump many terms together for centers that are far away from a center, and approximate the resulting partial sum by a single truncated Laurent expansion.

Reference-contexts: These triangulation methods have been extended to convex surfaces using one-sided property criterion <ref> [BO90] </ref>. A triangle has the one-sided property provided that all other scattered data points lie on the same side of the plane passing through the three points defining the triangle. A triangulation possesses the one-sided property provided every triangle in the triangulation has this property. <p> A triangulation possesses the one-sided property provided every triangle in the triangulation has this property. To build such a triangulation, one can start with some initial triangle and then add one point at a time ensuring that this property remains satisfied <ref> [BO90] </ref>. This algorithm leads to the circumscribed-circle criterion triangulation on a sphere. In the second step of the algorithm, the gradient of the function is estimated at every vertex essentially in the same way as in the planar 16 case by constructing a local least squares quadratic approximation.

Reference-contexts: This approach is typically much more complicated than the trivariate approach. In addition to these two approaches, there are other hybrid approaches as well. For example, an interpolant can be constructed inside a volumetric tube surrounding the surface <ref> [BOP92] </ref>. Moreover, one can use a domain mapping method to extend trivariate or bivariate approaches to a much larger class of surfaces as explained below. Typically, one can solve the surface-on-surface problem on a specific surface such as a sphere using either trivariate or bivariate approach.

Reference-contexts: Recent studies have however shown that depending upon the nature of the data, even though the triangulation may exhibit nice properties, the corresponding interpolant may not.

Natural Neighbor Interpolants: Natural neighbor interpolants [Sib81] can also be viewed as a variant of Shepard's method. In this interpolant, the choice of the damping function i (x; y) at a data point depends upon the neighboring geometry around that data point.

However the surface has a well-defined tangent plane at the limit point of an extraordinary point <ref> [BS88] </ref>. The upper left diagram of Figure 20 shows the initial control mesh. The upper right diagram and the lower left diagrams of Figure 20 show the mesh obtained after one and two iterations of the subdivision algorithm respectively.

Reference-contexts: Another important observation is that this property of reproduction of polynomials improves with increasing dimensions. Based on these observations on infinite grids, Gaussians and other integrable radial basis functions were said to have "a severe disadvantage", because they are not exact on constant functions <ref> [Buh89] </ref>. The other choices, especially multiquadrics, were said to be "far superior". However, as stated above, this theory is applicable only to the setting where the parameter h scales inversely with the data density.

Reference-contexts: The literature on scattered data interpolation is too vast to be covered in a single book, let alone a survey in a book. Several excellent surveys exist on selected subsets of solutions to scattered data interpolation problems. We refer the reader to <ref> [Pow90, Buh93, Har90] </ref> for radial basis function methods, to [Dyn92] for subdivision techniques, to [Baj92] for algebraic solutions, to [MLL + 92] for piecewise polynomial or rational parametric solutions to triangulated data and to [Sch76, Fra82a, BN84, Alf89, Nie93d, NF94, FH94] for polynomial and rational solutions as well as Shepard's methods <p> There are several good surveys on theoretical developments of radial basis functions [Dyn87, Dyn89] including recent in-depth surveys by Powell [Pow90], Light [Lig92], Buhmann <ref> [Buh93] </ref>, and Schaback [Sch95a] that address these and other radial basis functions. These mathematical surveys describe the results in great generality. These surveys also contain an extensive bibliography on radial basis functions for the interested reader. <p> Narcowich and Ward have done extensive work on studying the stability of solving these equations [NW91, NW92]. Both lower and upper bounds on the norm of the inverse matrix are discussed in <ref> [Buh93] </ref>. To overcome this difficulty, Dyn, Levin and Rippa proposed a scheme based on finite differences that enhances the stability of the computation of radial basis interpolants based on thin plate splines and shifted thin plate splines for scattered data sets [DLR86].

Reference-contexts: This technique has also been extended to provide solutions by C 2 smooth mesh of A-patches of degree 5.

Reference-contexts: The smooth curve obtained by this scheme turns out to be a quadratic B-spline curve obtained by treating the original vertices as control points. This idea was generalized to surfaces by Catmull-Clark <ref> [CC78] </ref> and Doo and Sabin [DS78] in 1978. In these schemes, an initial control mesh, that is, a polyhedron-like configuration of vertices, edges and faces is given in 3D. <p> Except for some special cases, the limiting surface does not have an explicit analytic expression to represent the surface. If each face of the polyhedron is a rectangle, the Doo-Sabin subdivision rules generate biquadratic tensor product B-splines [DS78] and the Catmull-Clark subdivision rules generate bicubic tensor product B-splines <ref> [CC78] </ref>. Another subdivision technique by Loop generates triangular box splines if each face of the polyhedron is a triangle [Loo87]. All the subdivision techniques mentioned above are approximating schemes. There are two key approaches to constructing interpolating subdivision surfaces. <p> Catmull-Clark Subdivision Technique: Catmull and Clark generalized the subdivision scheme from curves to surfaces <ref> [CC78] </ref>. The scheme starts with an initial given mesh M 0 and subdivides the mesh many times using the same set of deterministic rules at every step. Let M i be the mesh after i steps.

Reference-contexts: Currently there is little theory to guide a user towards an appropriate choice of this parameter. Apart from a few isolated theoretical results, most of the results are experimental. These results indicate that the performance of the radial interpolants depends critically on the choice of this parameter <ref> [CF91] </ref>. In the initial experiments, this parameter was chosen as the average distance between data points and performed quite well [Fra82a, Har90]. However this choice of the parameter did not perform very well on track data. <p> This type of data arises in important practical applications, for example, oceanographic and meteorological data collected on a ship. The accuracy of the multiquadric and inverse multiquadric interpolant on track data was improved by using different choices of this parameter <ref> [CF91] </ref>. Subsequently the accuracy of multiquadric and inverse multiquadric interpolants were further improved by choosing a parameter that minimized the difference between multiquadric and inverse multiquadric inter-polants [Fol94]. Different parameter values at different data points have also been used to improve the accuracy of these interpolants [KC92]. <p> More generally, the minimum value of m that guarantees the existence of the interpolant is often used. Experiments seem to indicate that addition of polynomial terms do not seem to improve the accuracy of the interpolant for non-polynomial functions <ref> [CF91] </ref>. There is another deeper reason for considering reproduction of polynomials. In numerical analysis and approximation theory, the property of reproduction of polynomials is often crucial in establishing good approximation properties of the interpolant.

Reference-contexts: The faces need not be planar and the vertices do not have to lie on a topologically regular mesh. Therefore, subdivision techniques are generally well suited for solving the surface reconstruction problem. Perhaps the best known subdivision technique was introduced by Chaikin in 1974 for curves <ref> [Cha74] </ref>. He generated a smooth curve from a polygon by successively refining the polygon by 36 cutting its corners. The smooth curve obtained by this scheme turns out to be a quadratic B-spline curve obtained by treating the original vertices as control points.

Reference-contexts: It has been proved that presence of k base points (counted with appropriate multiplicities) in the rational parametric representation of a surface with parametric degree n reduces its algebraic degree from n 2 in general to n 2 k <ref> [Chi90] </ref>. Therefore, presence of base points is advantageous in constructing algebraic surfaces of low degree. Tensor product surfaces of parametric degree mfin always have at least 2mn base points.

Reference-contexts: These splines are minimally supported as well, but in contrast to finite elements, they have specified smoothness property at the vertices of the triangulation. Use of vertex splines in solving scattered data interpolation problems is presented in <ref> [Chu88] </ref>. Multivariate B-splines are splines obtained by projections of simplices and are also referred to as simplex splines [DM83]. When these splines are obtained as projections of a cube, they are referred to as box splines. Box splines have been used to solve scattered data interpolation on a three-direction mesh.

Reference-contexts: Farin [Far82] and Piper [Pip87] give sufficient conditions for two polynomial patches to meet with tangent plane continuity. Computation of cross-boundary derivatives along the interpolating curve network is described in <ref> [CK83, Her85, Nie87b, Jen87] </ref>. In the second and the final step, each triangular hole bounded by three curves is filled in by one or more polynomial or rational surface patches in such a way that the overall surface is tangent or curvature continuous.

A complete link between good convergence behavior and the polynomial reproduction properties was however reestablished by Cheney and Light by again deriving necessary and sufficient conditions on the Fourier transform of a finite set of functions with rapid decay <ref> [CL94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The attraction is to achieve a good approximation with fewer centers. This can reduce the computation time in constructing and evaluating the interpolant or the approximant. Results indicate that significant savings can result at the cost of introducing very small errors <ref> [CN94] </ref>. However, the behavior of the condition number and therefore the problems of the stability of the computation (depending on the spacing between the data points relative to the multiquadric parameter) for interpolation by multiquadric functions carries over to least squares approximation.

In particular, Franke [Fra86] lists 24 explicit formulas for these radial basis functions and is an excellent starting point for those interested in this literature. Here we describe the conditions that guarantee the existence of radial basis interpolants.

Reference-contexts: Continuity conditions impose certain restrictions on a subset of control points. Remaining control points are chosen by user or by some default procedure in order to manipulate the shape of the interpolant. This approach was followed by Dahmen <ref> [Dah89] </ref> to construct C 1 piecewise smooth quadric interpolants using 6 patches per triangle. Dahmen [DTS93] and Guo [Guo91] constructed C 1 piecewise continuous cubic algebraic surfaces using 3 patches per triangle. However there are three major difficulties in these solutions.

Reference-contexts: Later Jia pointed out an error in the statement by Fix and Strang and provided a counterexample [Jia86]. However, de Boor and Jia were able to establish this link again under slightly different conditions for functions of compact support. This result was slightly improved by Jackson <ref> [dBJ85] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If the dimension of the resulting polynomial subspace equals the number of scattered data points, then the process terminates, otherwise k is incremented by 1 and the process is repeated. A proof that this method always works is provided in <ref> [dBR90] </ref>. A constructive procedure for building these interpolants using Gaussian elimination as well as a description of a MATLAB-like program is also presented [dBR92].

Reference-contexts: For example, given n+2 points on a straight line, one must choose a polynomial of degree n+2 1, while if the points are in general position, a bivariate polynomial of degree n would suffice. Given a set of scattered data points, de Boor and Ron <ref> [dBR92] </ref> have proposed a scheme for choosing a polynomial subspace S of the same dimension as the the number of scattered data points in such a way that the existence and the uniqueness of the interpolant is guaranteed. <p> A proof that this method always works is provided in [dBR90]. A constructive procedure for building these interpolants using Gaussian elimination as well as a description of a MATLAB-like program is also presented <ref> [dBR92] </ref>. We discuss the following example when the data is prescribed over the 6 points on a regular hexagon. First, the constant function is added to the polynomial subspace S. <p> The dimension of the orthogonal complement of these polynomials is 1. This subspace is then added to S to complete the construction of S. The dimension of S is now equal to 6, same as the number of data points. A symmetry argument is presented in <ref> [dBR92] </ref> to conclude that a cubic generator of S is x 3 3x 2 y. This completes the construction of S.

Reference-contexts: This method was first suggested by Nasri [Nas87]. The second approach is to modify the deterministic subdivision rules so that the limiting surface does interpolate the vertices.

Reference-contexts: Recent studies have however shown that depending upon the nature of the data, even though the triangulation may exhibit nice properties, the corresponding interpolant may not.

Reference-contexts: The construction of the final solution in terms of linear combinations of cardinal interpolants then depends upon the convergence of certain infinite series.

However cardinal interpolation by radial basis functions when the data is prescribed on an infinite regular integer lattice is well understood.

Reference-contexts: The smooth curve obtained by this scheme turns out to be a quadratic B-spline curve obtained by treating the original vertices as control points. This idea was generalized to surfaces by Catmull-Clark [CC78] and Doo and Sabin <ref> [DS78] </ref> in 1978. In these schemes, an initial control mesh, that is, a polyhedron-like configuration of vertices, edges and faces is given in 3D. Although faces of this configuration need not be planar, popular special cases arise when each face is a triangle or a rectangle. <p> Except for some special cases, the limiting surface does not have an explicit analytic expression to represent the surface. If each face of the polyhedron is a rectangle, the Doo-Sabin subdivision rules generate biquadratic tensor product B-splines <ref> [DS78] </ref> and the Catmull-Clark subdivision rules generate bicubic tensor product B-splines [CC78]. Another subdivision technique by Loop generates triangular box splines if each face of the polyhedron is a triangle [Loo87]. All the subdivision techniques mentioned above are approximating schemes. There are two key approaches to constructing interpolating subdivision surfaces.

Reference-contexts: The closest to a piecewise linear interpolant to scattered data sets is the concept of alpha-shape, which we discuss next. Alpha-Shapes: Alpha-shapes are a generalization of the convex hull of the scattered data points <ref> [EM94] </ref>. They are based on Delaunay tetrahedralization of the scattered data points in R 3 . <p> This intuitive description of the concept of alpha-shape is described very elegantly using the notion of alpha complexes and nerves of the Voronoi decomposition. An algorithm for computing and displaying the alpha shapes has been presented and implemented <ref> [EM94] </ref>. Figure 2 represents 8 alpha-shapes obtained from the scattered data points sampled from a person's bust by gradually reducing the value of ff from 1 to close to zero. It is tempting to adopt the alpha-shape approach to create piecewise linear triangulation of the given scattered data set.

Reference-contexts: Under certain non-degeneracy assumptions on the data set such as no more than four points are co-spherical, the Delaunay tetrahedralization is unique. The expected running time of the algorithm for computing Delaunay tetrahedralization is roughly log N times the number of tetrahedra using a randomized incremental flipping-based algorithm <ref> [ES92] </ref>. In the worst case, the number of tetrahedra can be about O (N 2 ). In practice, however, most point sets have many fewer Delaunay tetrahedra and therefore, the running time of the algorithm is much better than this theoretic bound.

Reference-contexts: Some more interpolants of this type are presented in [Pet90]. The overall idea for constructing these interpolants consists of two key steps: first, edges of the triangulation are replaced by an interpolating curve network usually with cross-boundary derivatives. Farin <ref> [Far82] </ref> and Piper [Pip87] give sufficient conditions for two polynomial patches to meet with tangent plane continuity. Computation of cross-boundary derivatives along the interpolating curve network is described in [CK83, Her85, Nie87b, Jen87].

Some early C 1 continuous interpolants were proposed by Akima [Aki78b, Aki78a], Lawson [Law86, Law77], and Renka and Cline [RC84, Ren84a]. These interpolants are local in the sense that any change in a data value affects the interpolant only in a neighborhood of that data point.

Reference-contexts: The interpolant is, in general, a piecewise rational quartic function <ref> [Far90] </ref>. As another example, i (x; y) is chosen to be i (x;y) r i (x;y) , and the weight functions are chosen to be i (x;y) P N . <p> The natural neighbor interpolant is then given by f (x; y) = P N i=1 w i (x; y)L i (x; y), where L i (x; y) are chosen to be linear polynomials. Properties of natural neighbor interpolants and generalizations of Sibson's natural neighbor interpolant are discussed in <ref> [Far90, Wat92, Wat94] </ref>. 5.1 Surfaces-on-Surfaces Trivariate Scattered Data: Shepard's Method: This method generalizes very readily to arbitrary dimensions, with the same shortcomings it has in two dimensions. The same techniques to overcome some of them apply in higher dimensions.

In particular, Franke [Fra86] lists 24 explicit formulas for these radial basis functions and is an excellent starting point for those interested in this literature. Here we describe the conditions that guarantee the existence of radial basis interpolants.

Reference-contexts: The transformation used by Sampson and Guttorp included no guarantee of being one-to-one. However, if the transformation is one-to-one, then the important property of positive definiteness of covariance functions follows to the new domain. This idea has been applied by Franke and Hagen <ref> [FH97] </ref> to construct a biquadratic transformation of the domain in terms of Bezier control points that is one-to- one, and thus the property of conditional positive definiteness of the multiquadrics is carried over to the new domain. <p> Hence the value of the multiquadric parameter is taken to be one on the transformed domain, leaving ten additional parameters as compared to the 23 nonlinear least squares technique with domain transformation described in <ref> [FH97] </ref> unit square used in obtaining the approximation shown in Figure 9 24 "old" multiquadric approximation. Ten additional parameters is equivalent to five free knots in two dimensions. The potential for improved fits to scattered data with a few knots is shown by the following sequence of figures. <p> The parent function from which the 200 data points were taken is shown in obtain the knot locations and a nonlinear least squares method with 17 knots. Figure 9 shows the results obtained by using the techniques of <ref> [FH97] </ref> combining the domain transformation with the approximation being computed in the transformed domain, using 12 knots, since degrees of freedom equivalent to 5 knots are taken up by the biquadratic transformation as described in the previous paragraph.

Reference-contexts: Sivakumar and Ward [SW93] have given upper bounds for the norms of the inverses of the normal equations associated with the least squares approximation problem. We now describe recent results on least squares approximation to scattered data using multi-quadric functions. Franke, Hagen, and Nielson <ref> [FHN94] </ref> described a greedy method for selection of centers (knots) for least squares approximation. Still better results were obtained by allowing both the multiquadric parameter and the knot locations to be determined by a nonlinear least squares process. <p> In practice, multiquadrics and inverse multiquadrics are implemented without any polynomial term at all or at most with addition of a constant <ref> [FHN94] </ref>, while the thin plate splines require and are usually implemented with addition of a linear polynomial term. More generally, the minimum value of m that guarantees the existence of the interpolant is often used.

Reference-contexts: Still better results were obtained by allowing both the multiquadric parameter and the knot locations to be determined by a nonlinear least squares process. A possible problem is the coalescence of knots, leading to poor conditioning of the least squares problem. In a subsequent paper <ref> [FHN95] </ref> the combined knots were replaced by a single repeated knot (the multiquadric basis function and its two partial derivatives as basis functions at the knot). This generally has a favorable impact on the condition number of the problem.

Reference-contexts: Floater and Iske have also also constructed interpolants for track data in several steps using compactly supported radial basis functions that we discuss later in this section <ref> [FI96a] </ref>. Selection of Centers: So far we have considered only the case when the centers for radial basis interpolant are located at the data points. However this need not be true. <p> Moreover, it is C 2 continuous at the zero, and C 3 continuous at the boundary. Similarly, 4;2 is of degree 8 and is positive definite of order 3. Moreover, it is C 4 continuous at the zero, and C 5 continuous at the boundary. Floater and Iske <ref> [FI96b, FI96a] </ref> have used Wendland's radial basis functions with compact support described in the previous paragraph for modeling scattered data in two major steps - thinning algorithm [FI98] and hierarchical residual interpolation. The construction is of great interest and therefore, we describe it in somewhat greater detail. <p> The computational complexity of this step of the algorithm in their current implementation is O (N 2 ), and can be improved O (N log N ) using known techniques <ref> [FI96a] </ref>. The second step of the algorithm, to which I refer to as the hierarchical residual interpolation, chooses a suitable subsequence, say of length m, of the resulting hierarchy. <p> The interpolation is achieved in m stages. At the first stage, all the points in Y 31 29 are interpolated using a radial basis function with compact support. Positive definiteness of this function guarantees a unique solution. In all the examples described in <ref> [FI96a, FI96b] </ref>, Wendland's 3;1 function has been chosen. The support of this basis function is chosen based on a combination of metrics q (Y 31 ) and Q (Y 31 ). <p> One way to get around the uncertainty principal is to perhaps use the hierarchical approach as used by Floater and Iske described above <ref> [FI96a] </ref>. In this case, first, since the support radii are growing smaller with increasing density, ther bandwidth B 2 remains roughly fixed so that the stability of the computation remains about the same. In usual cases, since B 1 remains the same as well, the error does not improve.

Reference-contexts: Typically, one can solve the surface-on-surface problem on a specific surface such as a sphere using either trivariate or bivariate approach. In the domain mapping method <ref> [FLN + 90b] </ref>, the idea is to map the surface F to a new surface G, say a sphere, using a mapping in such a way that the geodesic distances on F are not too badly distorted so that the intrinsic geometry is more or less preserved. <p> This technique has been further extended to the case of closed surfaces that are topologically equivalent to a sphere by using domain mapping method <ref> [FLN + 90b] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Most likely to give good results is a generalization of the minimum norm network method [Nie83, Pot92], generalized to tetrahedra by Nielson and Tvedt [NT94b], or generalizations of methods used by Renka and Cline [RC84] and Franke and Nielson <ref> [FN80] </ref> using local least squares quadratic approximations.

These surveys include polynomial, rational, radial and shepard-type interpolants as well. <p> The interpolant can, however, be sensitive to the choice of the radius h i . One such choice for h i is D q N , where D is the maximum distance between any two data points and N w is an arbitrarily chosen constant <ref> [FN80] </ref>. <p> Another choice for L i (x; y) is a quadratic polynomial function that interpolates the given point and achieves good approximation properties in the neighborhood of the point. The modified quadratic Shepard's method, introduced by Franke and Nielson <ref> [FN80] </ref>, is obtained by choosing (i) a quadratic L i (x; y), (ii) the inverse distance weight functions, as suggested originally by Shepard, along with (iii) the Franke-Little damping functions described in the previous paragraph.

Reference-contexts: Thus one can obtain an interpolation scheme with an arbitrarily high degree of polynomial precision. Yet another type of multistage interpolant was proposed by Foley <ref> [Fol84] </ref> to overcome the difficulty of the Boolean sum that it cannot be applied to tensor product based operators. Nielson and Foley [NF80] proposed the delta sum of two operators, P Q as P QP , that is, QP +P P QP .

Reference-contexts: Franke [Fra82b] implemented a method that blends local thin plate spline interpolants. The performance of this interpolant was poorer than the interpolant using the modified quadratic Shepard's method, but can be improved by using local interpolants of larger support than suggested in that paper.. Foley <ref> [Fol87] </ref> used the 33 flexibility in constructing these interpolants to build a system for constructing several interpolants for noisy, rapidly varying or nonuniformly distributed data points using these and multistage ideas described below. Extensive experimentation is required to control the enormous flexibility in these interpolants to achieve the desired result. <p> Nielson and Foley [NF80] proposed the delta sum of two operators, P Q as P QP , that is, QP +P P QP . We refer the reader to <ref> [BS84, Fol87] </ref> for a discussion on these interpolants. Natural Neighbor Interpolants: Natural neighbor interpolants [Sib81] can also be viewed as a variant of Shepard's method. In this interpolant, the choice of the damping function i (x; y) at a data point depends upon the neighboring geometry around that data point. <p> A version of this method is available as an ACM algorithm [Ren88]. Multistage methods: Multistage methods, either with or without the third step to obtain interpolation, are readily applied in higher dimensions. Foley <ref> [Fol87] </ref> discusses the trivariate case using the multiquadric method and his program TRIHASH (trivariate Hermite interpolation and Shepard). This is a very general program that uses a local interpolation or approximation method (multiquadric, or polynomials of various degrees) to estimate values for the function on a cubical grid.

Reference-contexts: Since they differ only by a constant, they yield the same solution to the system of linear equations posed for the interpolation problem. Analogous to the planar case, Foley also suggested the use of a C 2 continuous modified form of the multiquadrics <ref> [Fol90] </ref>, where the basis functions are rounded off in a small neighborhood of the antipodal point. All these radial basis function methods can however lead to a poorly conditioned system of equations for large data sets as in the planar case involving merely more than 200 points [PE90].

Reference-contexts: The accuracy of the multiquadric and inverse multiquadric interpolant on track data was improved by using different choices of this parameter [CF91]. Subsequently the accuracy of multiquadric and inverse multiquadric interpolants were further improved by choosing a parameter that minimized the difference between multiquadric and inverse multiquadric inter-polants <ref> [Fol94] </ref>. Different parameter values at different data points have also been used to improve the accuracy of these interpolants [KC92]. However, note that it is easy to construct data sets for 22 which the matrix for Equation 3 is singular when different parameter values are used at different points.

Reference-contexts: There are several ways to classify the solutions to scattered data interpolation problems, as is evident in the past surveys on this topic <ref> [Sch76, Fra82a, Alf89] </ref>. In this work, the class of solutions to the scattered data problem is classified into five categories based primarily on the form of the solution. The first category is the polynomial or piecewise continuous polynomial parametric solutions. <p> We refer the reader to [Pow90, Buh93, Har90] for radial basis function methods, to [Dyn92] for subdivision techniques, to [Baj92] for algebraic solutions, to [MLL + 92] for piecewise polynomial or rational parametric solutions to triangulated data and to <ref> [Sch76, Fra82a, BN84, Alf89, Nie93d, NF94, FH94] </ref> for polynomial and rational solutions as well as Shepard's methods and radial basis techniques. Nevertheless, we are not aware of any survey on scattered data interpolation techniques that attempts to cover all the five categories of solutions described in the previous paragraph. <p> The tensor product B-splines and NURBS are examples of solutions that belong to this category. 2.1 Function Reconstruction The literature on solutions to function reconstruction problem by piecewise polynomial and rational parametric functions is rich and many good surveys exist <ref> [Sch76, Fra82a, FN91, FHN93, Alf89, Far86, BFK84, Nie93d, Bar83] </ref>. In the category of polynomial and rational interpolants, most of these surveys emphasize construction of smooth interpolants. The presentation here is intended to be somewhat complementary to these surveys. <p> Minimum-Norm Network Method [Nie80, Nie83] is an example of a global interpolant based on a variational principle. This method was found to be of one of the most effective triangulation-based interpolant tested by Franke <ref> [Fra82a] </ref>. First, the convex hull of the data points (x i ; y i ) in the plane is triangulated. <p> In addition, the radial interpolants are translation and rotation invariant. Moreover, some of the radial basis functions, in particular multiquadrics and thin plate splines have performed very well in practical applications <ref> [Fra82a, Har90] </ref>. Radial basis function techniques have mostly been used to solve the function reconstruction problem. Variations of these techniques have also been used to solve the surface-on-surface problem. <p> Thin plate spline basis functions are defined as: (r k ) = r 2 k log r k . Observe that the thin plate splines also grow as the distance from the centers increase. These basis functions were also found to be successful by Franke <ref> [Fra82a] </ref>. For the thin plate splines, although the system of equations (2) may become singular for certain locations of data points, the system of equations (3) is always solvable for m 2. <p> These results indicate that the performance of the radial interpolants depends critically on the choice of this parameter [CF91]. In the initial experiments, this parameter was chosen as the average distance between data points and performed quite well <ref> [Fra82a, Har90] </ref>. However this choice of the parameter did not perform very well on track data. Track data is obtained when the data points are close together along a path or a track, but the distance between the tracks is one or more orders of magnitude higher. <p> To remove the discontinuities in the derivatives of the interpolant and the flat spots, one can use other weight functions w i (x; y) built from i (x; y) = e hr 2 r 2 . This weight function is found to be extremely time consuming <ref> [Fra82a] </ref>. An alternative is to consider the interpolant f (x; y) = P N i=1 w i (x; y)L i (x; y), where L i (x; y) is a local interpolant or approximant to data values with the property L i (x; y) = f i . <p> Although this version of Shepard's method performed better than other versions implemented and tested by Franke <ref> [Fra82a] </ref>, it did not perform as well as the purely radial basis function methods. In another generalization of Shepard's method, the weight functions w i (x; y) need not have the property w i (x j ; y j ) = ffi ij .

Reference-contexts: For even moderate sized data sets consisting of more than 300 to 500 points, local methods such as the ones discussed later in Section 5 are needed. For example, overlapping cubes with product Hermite cubic weight functions, as generalized from <ref> [Fra82b] </ref>, could be used. Function-on-Surface Problem: We now briefly describe how various approaches described in Section 2.3 have been extended to solve the problem of interpolating data on a surface using radial basis functions. <p> Franke <ref> [Fra82b] </ref> implemented a method that blends local thin plate spline interpolants. The performance of this interpolant was poorer than the interpolant using the modified quadratic Shepard's method, but can be improved by using local interpolants of larger support than suggested in that paper..

Reference-contexts: There is another deeper reason for considering reproduction of polynomials. In numerical analysis and approximation theory, the property of reproduction of polynomials is often crucial in establishing good approximation properties of the interpolant. This belief originates in the work by Fix and Strang <ref> [FS69] </ref> and has been very influential in constructing interpolants including construction of subdivision-based interpolants that we discuss later in Section 6.

Reference-contexts: An excellent description and further references can be found in [DL91]. More recently, a multivariate B-spline scheme that uses a combination of B-patches and simplex splines has also been used to solve the scattered data interpolation problem over arbitrary triangulations <ref> [FS93] </ref>. The piecewise interpolant is defined on a refined triangulation that depends upon the choice of knots needed to define the interpolants.

Reference-contexts: If interpolants are computed by truncating the global radial basis functions or by summing the contribution from a prechosen number of nearest points of interpolation, the inter-polant can be discontinuous. Although Franke and Salkauskas <ref> [FS95] </ref> have shown how to achieve continuity by a convolution process for such methods, the proposed scheme is not computation-ally viable. Localized Shepard's interpolants or localized radial basis interpolants with appropriate blending functions can also be expensive due to the need for sorting the data points.

We also refer the reader to a very nice survey on spherical splines that use zonal functions with small and scalable support <ref> [FSF97] </ref>. Zonal functions on spheres are of the type f (x y) and are rotationally invariant. 5 Shepard's Methods and Variants A scattered data interpolant using Shepard's method or its variant can be purely radially symmetric or a purely polynomial or rational function or a mixture of both.

Reference-contexts: There are several standard techniques for rendering a surface <ref> [FvDFH90] </ref>. However rendering a surface-on-surface in order to provide the viewer a convenient and unobstructed view of these surfaces is not an easy task. Therefore, we now discuss a few techniques for rendering surfaces-on-surfaces [FL91, FL90, FHN93, Nie93c], [PO94, PHD91, FLN90a, FLN + 90b].

Reference-contexts: This limitation of growing radial basis functions has prompted researchers to work with radial basis functions which decay with distances or even better, radial basis functions with compact support <ref> [Sch95a, GC98] </ref>. Observe that all the radial basis functions mentioned so far do not have compact support. The decaying radial basis functions, such as Gaussians and inverse multiquadrics have often been employed in practice by truncating them. Another popular radial basis function with compact support is rotated cubic B-splines.

Reference-contexts: Experiments with location of centers have mostly focused on approximating methods [MF92]. Although least squares approximation is most popular, other objective functions have also been considered for minimization <ref> [Sal92, Gir92] </ref>. The attraction is to achieve a good approximation with fewer centers. This can reduce the computation time in constructing and evaluating the interpolant or the approximant. Results indicate that significant savings can result at the cost of introducing very small errors [CN94].

Reference-contexts: Remaining control points are chosen by user or by some default procedure in order to manipulate the shape of the interpolant. This approach was followed by Dahmen [Dah89] to construct C 1 piecewise smooth quadric interpolants using 6 patches per triangle. Dahmen [DTS93] and Guo <ref> [Guo91] </ref> constructed C 1 piecewise continuous cubic algebraic surfaces using 3 patches per triangle. However there are three major difficulties in these solutions. First, it is a non-trivial task to construct a surrounding network of tetrahedron within which the trivariate polynomial is built.

Reference-contexts: Assuming that a solution to the system of equations (2) or (3) exist, the radial basis interpolant is then given by Equation (1). One of the most popular radial basis functions was introduced by Hardy more than 25 years ago <ref> [Har71] </ref>. These basis functions are referred to as Hardy's multiquadrics. Multiquadrics are defined as (r k ) = q k + h 2 , where h is a suitably chosen parameter. Observe that the multi-quadrics grow as the distance from the centers increase.

Reference-contexts: The literature on scattered data interpolation is too vast to be covered in a single book, let alone a survey in a book. Several excellent surveys exist on selected subsets of solutions to scattered data interpolation problems. We refer the reader to <ref> [Pow90, Buh93, Har90] </ref> for radial basis function methods, to [Dyn92] for subdivision techniques, to [Baj92] for algebraic solutions, to [MLL + 92] for piecewise polynomial or rational parametric solutions to triangulated data and to [Sch76, Fra82a, BN84, Alf89, Nie93d, NF94, FH94] for polynomial and rational solutions as well as Shepard's methods <p> In addition, the radial interpolants are translation and rotation invariant. Moreover, some of the radial basis functions, in particular multiquadrics and thin plate splines have performed very well in practical applications <ref> [Fra82a, Har90] </ref>. Radial basis function techniques have mostly been used to solve the function reconstruction problem. Variations of these techniques have also been used to solve the surface-on-surface problem. <p> Observe that the multi-quadrics grow as the distance from the centers increase. This appears as a counter-intuitive choice of radial basis functions to many, and therefore inverse multiquadrics was invented and was also applied very successfully <ref> [Har90] </ref>. Inverse multiquadrics are defined as the inverse of multiquadrics, that is, (r k ) = 1 p r 2 k +h 2 . Inverse multiquadrics decay as the distance from the centers increase. <p> This however did not distract the early practitioners of this method and the evidence of the success of Hardy's multiquadrics mounted over several years <ref> [Har90] </ref>. At the time when Hardy's multiquadrics and inverse multiquadrics were being applied very successfully to several applications without much theoretical justification, thin plate splines were introduced by Harder and Desmarais [HD72]. Duchon [Duc76] developed a complete theory of thin plate splines with theoretical justification based on 20 variational principles. <p> These results indicate that the performance of the radial interpolants depends critically on the choice of this parameter [CF91]. In the initial experiments, this parameter was chosen as the average distance between data points and performed quite well <ref> [Fra82a, Har90] </ref>. However this choice of the parameter did not perform very well on track data. Track data is obtained when the data points are close together along a path or a track, but the distance between the tracks is one or more orders of magnitude higher.

Reference-contexts: therefore necessarily decay away from the centers) such as Gaussians or radial basis functions with compact support may not work well for an infinite gridded data on an integer lattice when the parameter h or the support radius involved in these radial basis functions scales inversely with the data density <ref> [Jac88, Pow90] </ref>. For example, 25 Gaussians e h 2 r 3 k do not make good interpolants on an infinite integer grid when h is proportional to the minimum distance between the data points.

Reference-contexts: Farin [Far82] and Piper [Pip87] give sufficient conditions for two polynomial patches to meet with tangent plane continuity. Computation of cross-boundary derivatives along the interpolating curve network is described in <ref> [CK83, Her85, Nie87b, Jen87] </ref>. In the second and the final step, each triangular hole bounded by three curves is filled in by one or more polynomial or rational surface patches in such a way that the overall surface is tangent or curvature continuous. <p> The remaining degrees of freedom are used to make the internal boundaries of the patches to meet with tangent plane continuity. This technique has been used to construct three polynomial patches of degree four per hole <ref> [SS87, Jen87, Pip87] </ref>. Convex combination schemes create one single patch per hole. First, three patches are constructed, each of which interpolates part of the boundary data. Then a convex combination of the three patches is formed in such a way that the resulting patch interpolates all of the data.

Reference-contexts: Subsequently the accuracy of multiquadric and inverse multiquadric interpolants were further improved by choosing a parameter that minimized the difference between multiquadric and inverse multiquadric inter-polants [Fol94]. Different parameter values at different data points have also been used to improve the accuracy of these interpolants <ref> [KC92] </ref>. However, note that it is easy to construct data sets for 22 which the matrix for Equation 3 is singular when different parameter values are used at different points.

Reference-contexts: As in the planar case, different criteria can be used to generate different triangulations. It is important to generate triangulations that cover the surface uniformly. The spherical circumscribed circle criterion ensures that any given data point lies outside the spherical circle that passes through three points defining a triangle <ref> [Law84, Ren84b] </ref>. The spherical max-min angle criterion ensures that for every quadrilateral in a triangulation defined by two adjacent triangles, the minimum of the six angles associated with the quadrilateral is greater than the minimum of the six angles associated with the quadrilateral obtained by swapping the diagonal [NR87].

Reference-contexts: This section describes some of the recent techniques to build interpolants on irregular meshes. Although attempts have been made to fill n-sided holes for more than a decade, S-patches <ref> [LD89] </ref> are perhaps one of the most promising representation for filling n-sided holes because they are multi-sided generalization of Bernstein-Bezier surface patches, and thus have much better potential of integration with existing geometric modeling systems than previously proposed systems.

Reference-contexts: Tensor product surfaces of parametric degree mfin always have at least 2mn base points. S-patches (which have base points) and another rational multisided generalization of Bernstein-Bezier surfaces with base points have been used to fill holes <ref> [LD90, War92] </ref>. In the reverse direction, the procedure for converting algebraic surfaces into rational parametric form is known as parametrization. For n &gt; 3, there always exists an algebraic surface of degree n that does not have a rational parametric representation of any degree at all [SAG84].

Reference-contexts: If each face of the polyhedron is a rectangle, the Doo-Sabin subdivision rules generate biquadratic tensor product B-splines [DS78] and the Catmull-Clark subdivision rules generate bicubic tensor product B-splines [CC78]. Another subdivision technique by Loop generates triangular box splines if each face of the polyhedron is a triangle <ref> [Loo87] </ref>. All the subdivision techniques mentioned above are approximating schemes. There are two key approaches to constructing interpolating subdivision surfaces.

Assume the data points are given and a Delaunay tetrahedralization of the convex hull (or other convenient region) is computed.

Reference-contexts: However this need not be true. The question is what happens if the centers are located elsewhere? There is a theoretical reason that the interpolation is optimal if the centers are located at the data points [Sch95a]. Experiments with location of centers have mostly focused on approximating methods <ref> [MF92] </ref>. Although least squares approximation is most popular, other objective functions have also been considered for minimization [Sal92, Gir92]. The attraction is to achieve a good approximation with fewer centers. This can reduce the computation time in constructing and evaluating the interpolant or the approximant.

Reference-contexts: Inverse multiquadrics decay as the distance from the centers increase. It is amazing that it was not until 1985 that it was established that the linear system of equations (2) and (3) is solvable for multiquadrics as well as inverse multiquadrics <ref> [Mic86] </ref>. This however did not distract the early practitioners of this method and the evidence of the success of Hardy's multiquadrics mounted over several years [Har90]. <p> Micchelli provided the following characterization for conditionally positive definite functions and derived the following important result: Theorem <ref> [Mic86] </ref>: A function f (t) is conditionally positive definite of order m in R d for d 1, if and only if (1) j d j dt j f ( t) 0, t &gt; 0, j m. <p> Important results concerning the theory of such methods was given by Micchelli <ref> [Mic86] </ref>, and these results also have a bearing on whether the given method is proper, that is, whether the matrix of the system of equations for the coefficients of the basis functions is (conditionally) positive definite and therefore, the existence of a solution is guaranteed.

Reference-contexts: Several excellent surveys exist on selected subsets of solutions to scattered data interpolation problems. We refer the reader to [Pow90, Buh93, Har90] for radial basis function methods, to [Dyn92] for subdivision techniques, to [Baj92] for algebraic solutions, to <ref> [MLL + 92] </ref> for piecewise polynomial or rational parametric solutions to triangulated data and to [Sch76, Fra82a, BN84, Alf89, Nie93d, NF94, FH94] for polynomial and rational solutions as well as Shepard's methods and radial basis techniques. <p> The focus now is on constructing smooth interpolants. Interpolants on Triangulated Data: A large number of piecewise polynomial and rational interpolants have been suggested for surface reconstruction to fit a triangulated scattered data. Fortunately, there is an excellent survey of these interpolants <ref> [MLL + 92] </ref>. Some more interpolants of this type are presented in [Pet90]. The overall idea for constructing these interpolants consists of two key steps: first, edges of the triangulation are replaced by an interpolating curve network usually with cross-boundary derivatives. <p> This technique has been used to create piecewise tangent and curvature continuous rational scattered data interpolants [Nie88, Nie87b, Her85, HP89, Hag86]. An early survey on surface construction based upon triangulations is available in [NF83]. One of the major findings of the more recent survey <ref> [MLL + 92] </ref> is that most of the local interpolants suffer 12 from similar shape defects. The primary cause of the shape defect seems to be in the construction of boundary curves. <p> A popular characteristic of the surface is its Gaussian curvature. Lounsbery et al <ref> [LMD92, MLL + 92] </ref> assigned a color to every point on the surface according to the value of the Gaussian curvature at that point.

Reference-contexts: However, as stated above, this theory is applicable only to the setting where the parameter h scales inversely with the data density. However, if the parameter h is fixed, it has been shown that Gaussians have an even better convergence behavior than multiquadrics for scattered data <ref> [MN92] </ref>. In fact, in other circumstances as well, even when h is allowed to vary discreetly, so that Gaussians do not satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions linking good convergence behavior with polynomial reproduction property, Gaussians also have a good convergence behavior [BL92].

Reference-contexts: The subdivision technique is then applied to this new configuration. This method was first suggested by Nasri <ref> [Nas87] </ref>. The second approach is to modify the deterministic subdivision rules so that the limiting surface does interpolate the vertices. This method was first suggested by Dyn, Levin and Gregory as a 4-point [DLG87] scheme for curves and later extended to a butterfly subdivision scheme for surfaces [DLG90]. <p> To generate subdivision surfaces that interpolate the given vertices, one has to compute a new configuration of vertices, edges and faces with the same topology such that the vertices of the new configuration converge to the given vertices in the limit. Nasri <ref> [Nas87] </ref> suggested this approach by applying the Doo-Sabin scheme to a modified set of control points with the same topology. To compute the new or modified configuration, a system of interpolation constraints that relate the new set of vertices to the given set of vertices is developed.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the interpolant should not depend upon whether the data was measured in terms of inches and seconds or in terms of feet and minutes. Yet many interpolants fall short of desirable invariance properties <ref> [Nie87a, Nie93b, NF89] </ref>. A scattered data interpolant S is said to be invariant with respect to a transformation T of the input data X if S ffi T (x) = T ffi S (x). <p> A method S is said to be translation (respectively rotation, affine) invariant if the interpolant S satisfies the above property for any translation T (respectively rotation, affine transformation). Nielson and Foley <ref> [NF89] </ref> further distinguish between scale-invariant methods when the interpolant is invariant with respect to any scale transformation T and the scalar-invariant methods when the interpolant is invariant with respect to those scale transformations, where the scaling is identical along all coordinate axes. <p> An example of this occurs, when the parameter h is chosen as a constant times D, the maximum distance between any two data points a popular choice as described in Section 5. Nielson and Foley <ref> [Nie87a, Nie93b, NF89] </ref> have described a method for modifying many scattered data methods in order to make them affine invariant by replacing Euclidean metric by an affinely invariant metric.

Because the face data is not known from derivative estimates, it is necessary to estimate the value and normal derivative for each face. Nielson and Tvedt [NT94b] discuss more of the details of the required scheme.

Minimum-Norm Network Method <ref> [Nie80, Nie83] </ref> is an example of a global interpolant based on a variational principle. This method was found to be of one of the most effective triangulation-based interpolant tested by Franke [Fra82a]. <p> Several methods for estimating derivatives are possible. Based on experience with the bivariate case, this is a crucial step in the process and the quality of the approximation depends heavily on reasonable estimates. Most likely to give good results is a generalization of the minimum norm network method <ref> [Nie83, Pot92] </ref>, generalized to tetrahedra by Nielson and Tvedt [NT94b], or generalizations of methods used by Renka and Cline [RC84] and Franke and Nielson [FN80] using local least squares quadratic approximations. Function-on-Surface Problem: Several good surveys exist on constructing scattered data in-terpolants over surfaces [BF91, FN91, Nie93c, HL93].

Reference-contexts: However the straightforward extension is not always useful. For example, the tensor product nu-splines tightens up all along the parameter curves undesirably. In such cases, additional techniques need to be invented in order to tackle these problems <ref> [Nie86] </ref>. Nevertheless, many techniques for scattered data interpolation derive their motivation from similar schemes for curves and therefore, we will mention them wherever appropriate.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the interpolant should not depend upon whether the data was measured in terms of inches and seconds or in terms of feet and minutes.

Reference-contexts: Function-on-Surface Problem: Several good surveys exist on constructing scattered data in-terpolants over surfaces <ref> [BF91, FN91, Nie93c, HL93] </ref>.

Nevertheless, we are not aware of any survey on scattered data interpolation techniques that attempts to cover all the five categories of solutions described in the previous paragraph. <p> A brief discussion on these two popular variations of the scattered data interpolation problem is included for 3 the sake of completeness. We refer the reader to <ref> [Alf89, Nie93d, ND91, NT94a, NT94b, Tve91] </ref> for scattered volumetric data modeling. Third, an attempt has been made to focus on relatively recent techniques of scattered data interpolation, although for the sake of completeness, brief descriptions or appropriate references for older techniques are presented. <p> The tensor product B-splines and NURBS are examples of solutions that belong to this category. 2.1 Function Reconstruction The literature on solutions to function reconstruction problem by piecewise polynomial and rational parametric functions is rich and many good surveys exist <ref> [Sch76, Fra82a, FN91, FHN93, Alf89, Far86, BFK84, Nie93d, Bar83] </ref>. In the category of polynomial and rational interpolants, most of these surveys emphasize construction of smooth interpolants. The presentation here is intended to be somewhat complementary to these surveys. <p> There is much that remains untested even for the two popular variations of the surfaces-on-surfaces problems - trivariate (or volumetric) scattered data problem and the function-on-surface problem. For example, although the study conducted by Nielson and Tvedt <ref> [Tve91, NT94a, Nie93d] </ref> compares nine trivariate schemes (Shepard's method, modified quadratic Shepard method, volume splines, multiquadric method without linear precision, multiquadric with linear precision, local volume splines, piecewise linear on tetrahedra, and a C 1 method on tetrahedra) to 54 sets of data (6 configurations of points and 9 functions sampled

Reference-contexts: There is also a generalization of the Powell-Sabin split [PS77] using piecewise quadratic polynomials, by Worsey and Piper [WP88], and while this offers easy exact contouring, the patch subdivides the tetrahedron into 24 subtetrahedra. Nielson and Opitz <ref> [NO92] </ref> generalized the side-vertex scheme [Nie79] to a face-vertex scheme for tetrahedra. This method yields a rational patch. Because the face data is not known from derivative estimates, it is necessary to estimate the value and normal derivative for each face.

Reference-contexts: The spherical max-min angle criterion ensures that for every quadrilateral in a triangulation defined by two adjacent triangles, the minimum of the six angles associated with the quadrilateral is greater than the minimum of the six angles associated with the quadrilateral obtained by swapping the diagonal <ref> [NR87] </ref>. These triangulation methods have been extended to convex surfaces using one-sided property criterion [BO90]. A triangle has the one-sided property provided that all other scattered data points lie on the same side of the plane passing through the three points defining the triangle. <p> In the third and final step of the algorithm, every triangle is replaced by a polynomial or a rational surface patch that meets the adjacent patch with tangent plane continuity using the minimum norm network method <ref> [NR87] </ref>. This technique has been further extended to the case of closed surfaces that are topologically equivalent to a sphere by using domain mapping method [FLN + 90b]. Minimum norm network method has also been extended to surfaces that are at least C 2 differentiable [Pot92].

Reference-contexts: spherical inverse multiquadrics by using the functions R k (x) = (1+l 2 2l cos (s k (x))) 1 2 as suggested in [HG75] or by considering spherical multiquadrics by using the functions R k (x) = (1 + l 2 2l cos (s k (x))) 2 as suggested in <ref> [PE90] </ref>. Interestingly, the trivariate multiquadric method turns out to be equivalent to the spherical mul-tiquadrics for spheres [PE96]. This fact has not appeared in the literature, and is not well-known. The proof is however straightforward and simple. <p> All these radial basis function methods can however lead to a poorly conditioned system of equations for large data sets as in the planar case involving merely more than 200 points <ref> [PE90] </ref>. For the case of sphere, pseudosplines proposed by Wahba [Wah81] seem very well behaved. We also refer the reader to a very nice survey on spherical splines that use zonal functions with small and scalable support [FSF97]. <p> The local interpolants L i (x) are biquadratic functions that interpolate the five nearest non-barrier points in the neighborhood of x i . The second solution uses localized versions of radial basis function methods and blends these using weight functions to build an interpolant on a sphere S <ref> [PE90] </ref>. The interpolant is defined as before by f (x) = P M i=1 w i (x)L i (x). <p> However, by default, one can choose a regular covering of the sphere by congruent caps so that M i are vertices of a regular polyhedron, that is a tetrahedron (M=4), octahedron (M=6), cube (M=8), icosahedron (M=12) or dodecahedron (M=20) <ref> [PE90] </ref>. The radius i has to be greater than the supremum of the radii of circumcircles of the triangles in the triangulation. The weight function w i (x) are defined in terms of i (x) as before, where i (x) are now Franke-Little type weights.

Fortunately, there is an excellent survey of these interpolants [MLL + 92]. Some more interpolants of this type are presented in <ref> [Pet90] </ref>. The overall idea for constructing these interpolants consists of two key steps: first, edges of the triangulation are replaced by an interpolating curve network usually with cross-boundary derivatives.

Alternative solutions consisting of quadratic and cubic triangular patches or biquadratic rectangular patches or a combination of these have also been described <ref> [Pet95] </ref>. For example, each of the quadrilateral subcells is covered with four triangular quadratic or cubic patches by inserting a control point S near the centroid of the quadrilateral subcell and connecting S with the vertices of the quadrilateral. <p> Each of these cells are then further subdivided into four cubic patches (not shown in the diagram).

Pottmann <ref> [Pot88] </ref> describes a generalized isophote method for automatic testing of continuity across the boundaries of a patchwork of surfaces.

Reference-contexts: Several methods for estimating derivatives are possible. Based on experience with the bivariate case, this is a crucial step in the process and the quality of the approximation depends heavily on reasonable estimates. Most likely to give good results is a generalization of the minimum norm network method <ref> [Nie83, Pot92] </ref>, generalized to tetrahedra by Nielson and Tvedt [NT94b], or generalizations of methods used by Renka and Cline [RC84] and Franke and Nielson [FN80] using local least squares quadratic approximations. Function-on-Surface Problem: Several good surveys exist on constructing scattered data in-terpolants over surfaces [BF91, FN91, Nie93c, HL93]. <p> This technique has been further extended to the case of closed surfaces that are topologically equivalent to a sphere by using domain mapping method [FLN + 90b].

Reference-contexts: The literature on scattered data interpolation is too vast to be covered in a single book, let alone a survey in a book. Several excellent surveys exist on selected subsets of solutions to scattered data interpolation problems. We refer the reader to <ref> [Pow90, Buh93, Har90] </ref> for radial basis function methods, to [Dyn92] for subdivision techniques, to [Baj92] for algebraic solutions, to [MLL + 92] for piecewise polynomial or rational parametric solutions to triangulated data and to [Sch76, Fra82a, BN84, Alf89, Nie93d, NF94, FH94] for polynomial and rational solutions as well as Shepard's methods <p> There are several good surveys on theoretical developments of radial basis functions [Dyn87, Dyn89] including recent in-depth surveys by Powell <ref> [Pow90] </ref>, Light [Lig92], Buhmann [Buh93], and Schaback [Sch95a] that address these and other radial basis functions. These mathematical surveys describe the results in great generality. These surveys also contain an extensive bibliography on radial basis functions for the interested reader. <p> For this infinite gridded data it can be proved that the the coefficients k decay so rapidly that the cardinal interpolant i exists for linear, cubic, thin plate splines, multiquadrics, inverse multiquadrics and Gaussian radial basis functions <ref> [Pow90] </ref>. Intuitively, appropriate cancellation takes place for fast growing radial basis functions at locations far away from the data center where it achieves the value 1. <p> therefore necessarily decay away from the centers) such as Gaussians or radial basis functions with compact support may not work well for an infinite gridded data on an integer lattice when the parameter h or the support radius involved in these radial basis functions scales inversely with the data density <ref> [Jac88, Pow90] </ref>. For example, 25 Gaussians e h 2 r 3 k do not make good interpolants on an infinite integer grid when h is proportional to the minimum distance between the data points. <p> reproduces the given polynomial in case of linear, cubic, thin plate splines, multiquadrics and inverse multiquadrics with m = d; d + 2; d + 1; d 2 and d respectively where d is the dimension of the underlying space except for the case d = 1 for inverse multiquadrics <ref> [Pow90] </ref>. In particular, for bivariate polynomials, polynomials of degree up to 2, 4, 3, 0 and 2 are reproduced by linear, cubic, thin plate splines, multiquadrics and inverse multiquadrics. Another important observation is that this property of reproduction of polynomials improves with increasing dimensions.

There is an extension of the Clough-Tocher patch to n-dimensions, by Worsey and Farin [WF87]. There is also a generalization of the Powell-Sabin split <ref> [PS77] </ref> using piecewise quadratic polynomials, by Worsey and Piper [WP88], and while this offers easy exact contouring, the patch subdivides the tetrahedron into 24 subtetrahedra. Nielson and Opitz [NO92] generalized the side-vertex scheme [Nie79] to a face-vertex scheme for tetrahedra. This method yields a rational patch.

Reference-contexts: Piecewise Linear Solutions: A popular solution is to construct a Delaunay triangulation of the scattered data points in R 2 and construct the piecewise linear interpolant on this triangulation. Delaunay triangulation is a triangulation with many nice properties and a good source of reference is <ref> [PS85] </ref>. Delaunay triangulation can be computed in O (N log N ) time. Recent studies have however shown that depending upon the nature of the data, even though the triangulation may exhibit nice properties, the corresponding interpolant may not. <p> A given set of scattered data points (x i ; y i ) in the plane determines a collection of polygons known as Dirichlet, Voronoi or Thiessen tessellation <ref> [PS85] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Remarks: One of the greatest challenges with the subdivision techniques is to establish the exact criteria on the set of subdivision rules that yield nice properties for the limiting subdivision surface <ref> [Rei95, War95] </ref>. The proofs to establish that the limiting surface exists, and is continuous or tangent plane continuous are often very long, laborious and subtle. Systematic attempts have been made by several researchers to both simplify and improve upon the existing results.

Reference-contexts: As in the planar case, different criteria can be used to generate different triangulations. It is important to generate triangulations that cover the surface uniformly. The spherical circumscribed circle criterion ensures that any given data point lies outside the spherical circle that passes through three points defining a triangle <ref> [Law84, Ren84b] </ref>. The spherical max-min angle criterion ensures that for every quadrilateral in a triangulation defined by two adjacent triangles, the minimum of the six angles associated with the quadrilateral is greater than the minimum of the six angles associated with the quadrilateral obtained by swapping the diagonal [NR87].

Reference-contexts: The same techniques to overcome some of them apply in higher dimensions. In particular, modification of the "inverse distance" function for finite support and local approximation by a polynomial greatly improves its behavior. A version of this method is available as an ACM algorithm <ref> [Ren88] </ref>. Multistage methods: Multistage methods, either with or without the third step to obtain interpolation, are readily applied in higher dimensions. Foley [Fol87] discusses the trivariate case using the multiquadric method and his program TRIHASH (trivariate Hermite interpolation and Shepard).

Reference-contexts: For smooth interpolation it is then necessary to have a function defined on each tetrahedron (a patch) that matches value and first derivatives across boundaries to adjacent tetrahedra. This can be achieved by various methods. Rescorla <ref> [Res87] </ref> uses a ninth degree patch due to Zen isek [Zen73], with 220 degrees of freedom and requiring derivatives as high as fourth order to be estimated. Clearly a simpler patch is required, and there are several alternatives.

Reference-contexts: Relationship between Parametric and Algebraic Surfaces: The relationship between parametric and algebraic solutions is very interesting and rich. A rational parametric surface of parametric degree n can always be represented as an algebraic surface of algebraic degree at most n 2 <ref> [SAG84] </ref>. This process of converting from rational parametric surfaces to algebraic surfaces, referred to as implicitization, remains computationally very expensive in general. In practice, therefore, this conversion is rarely attempted. <p> In the reverse direction, the procedure for converting algebraic surfaces into rational parametric form is known as parametrization. For n &gt; 3, there always exists an algebraic surface of degree n that does not have a rational parametric representation of any degree at all <ref> [SAG84] </ref>. Fortunately, the scenario for low degree algebraic surfaces is rather promising. An algebraic surface of degree 1 is simply a plane, and therefore can easily be represented as a polynomial parametric surface of degree 1 and vice-versa.

Reference-contexts: Algebraic surfaces of degree 4 referred to as quartics include surfaces such as the torus and cyclides. Quartic surfaces have been studied by classical geometers and classified into several categories <ref> [Sal14] </ref>; still a constructive algorithm for parametrization of those quartics that are parametrizable has not yet been developed. We shall soon see that most scattered data interpolation problems can now be solved using low degree algebraic surfaces, in most cases by surfaces with algebraic degree up to 3.

Reference-contexts: Experiments with location of centers have mostly focused on approximating methods [MF92]. Although least squares approximation is most popular, other objective functions have also been considered for minimization <ref> [Sal92, Gir92] </ref>. The attraction is to achieve a good approximation with fewer centers. This can reduce the computation time in constructing and evaluating the interpolant or the approximant. Results indicate that significant savings can result at the cost of introducing very small errors [CN94].

Reference-contexts: There are several ways to classify the solutions to scattered data interpolation problems, as is evident in the past surveys on this topic <ref> [Sch76, Fra82a, Alf89] </ref>. In this work, the class of solutions to the scattered data problem is classified into five categories based primarily on the form of the solution. The first category is the polynomial or piecewise continuous polynomial parametric solutions. <p> We refer the reader to [Pow90, Buh93, Har90] for radial basis function methods, to [Dyn92] for subdivision techniques, to [Baj92] for algebraic solutions, to [MLL + 92] for piecewise polynomial or rational parametric solutions to triangulated data and to <ref> [Sch76, Fra82a, BN84, Alf89, Nie93d, NF94, FH94] </ref> for polynomial and rational solutions as well as Shepard's methods and radial basis techniques. Nevertheless, we are not aware of any survey on scattered data interpolation techniques that attempts to cover all the five categories of solutions described in the previous paragraph. <p> The tensor product B-splines and NURBS are examples of solutions that belong to this category. 2.1 Function Reconstruction The literature on solutions to function reconstruction problem by piecewise polynomial and rational parametric functions is rich and many good surveys exist <ref> [Sch76, Fra82a, FN91, FHN93, Alf89, Far86, BFK84, Nie93d, Bar83] </ref>. In the category of polynomial and rational interpolants, most of these surveys emphasize construction of smooth interpolants. The presentation here is intended to be somewhat complementary to these surveys.

Reference-contexts: However, except for Delaunay triangulation, this local edge swapping criteria leads to only locally optimal and not to globally optimal triangulation. Schumaker proposed a simulated annealing technique to search for globally optimal triangulations for a wide class of optimality criteria <ref> [Sch93a] </ref>. Although this technique is not guaranteed to find the globally optimal triangulation, the overall probability of finding the globally optimal triangulation is increased. Each step of the algorithm selects a random edge for a local swap.

Reference-contexts: To remedy the situation, piecewise linear interpolants have been suggested that are built on triangulations that depend upon data [DLR90, Bro91, QS90]. Different kinds of triangulations have been studied that use different optimality criteria <ref> [Sch93b] </ref>: (i) Max-min Angle Criterion: A triangulation is said to be optimal with respect to the max-min angle criterion provided that the maximum of the minimum angle of any triangle in is the maximum over all possible triangulations of the same region with the same vertices.

Reference-contexts: There are several good surveys on theoretical developments of radial basis functions [Dyn87, Dyn89] including recent in-depth surveys by Powell [Pow90], Light [Lig92], Buhmann [Buh93], and Schaback <ref> [Sch95a] </ref> that address these and other radial basis functions. These mathematical surveys describe the results in great generality. These surveys also contain an extensive bibliography on radial basis functions for the interested reader. <p> However this need not be true. The question is what happens if the centers are located elsewhere? There is a theoretical reason that the interpolation is optimal if the centers are located at the data points <ref> [Sch95a] </ref>. Experiments with location of centers have mostly focused on approximating methods [MF92]. Although least squares approximation is most popular, other objective functions have also been considered for minimization [Sal92, Gir92]. The attraction is to achieve a good approximation with fewer centers. <p> This limitation of growing radial basis functions has prompted researchers to work with radial basis functions which decay with distances or even better, radial basis functions with compact support <ref> [Sch95a, GC98] </ref>. Observe that all the radial basis functions mentioned so far do not have compact support. The decaying radial basis functions, such as Gaussians and inverse multiquadrics have often been employed in practice by truncating them. Another popular radial basis function with compact support is rotated cubic B-splines. <p> Initial results on using these radial basis functions for scattered data interpolation seem to be promising <ref> [Sch95a] </ref>. Figure 11 shows the well-known Franke's analytic function with two hills, a valley and a saddle. Figure 12 shows the thin plate spline interpolant for the Franke's function on a 5 fi 5 grid. Figure 13 shows the function 2;1 .

Reference-contexts: Numerical observations and theoretical results indicate that there is an uncertainty relationship between the error and the stability of the computation while using radial basis functions with parameter h that is proportional to the minimum distance between data points <ref> [Sch95b] </ref>. Roughly speaking, in this situation, the product of the error and the instability of the computation is always greater than some constant. Therefore, it is not possible to achieve both small error and stability. This is one of the greatest disadvantages of radial basis approach.

Reference-contexts: We shall soon see that most scattered data interpolation problems can now be solved using low degree algebraic surfaces, in most cases by surfaces with algebraic degree up to 3. Algebraic Interpolants: Algebraic surfaces have been used to solve both the surface reconstruction as well as surfaces-on-surfaces problem.

Natural Neighbor Interpolants: Natural neighbor interpolants <ref> [Sib81] </ref> can also be viewed as a variant of Shepard's method. In this interpolant, the choice of the damping function i (x; y) at a data point depends upon the neighboring geometry around that data point.

This technique has been used to construct three polynomial patches of degree four per hole <ref> [SS87, Jen87, Pip87] </ref>. Convex combination schemes create one single patch per hole. First, three patches are constructed, each of which interpolates part of the boundary data. Then a convex combination of the three patches is formed in such a way that the resulting patch interpolates all of the data.

Reference-contexts: However, the behavior of the condition number and therefore the problems of the stability of the computation (depending on the spacing between the data points relative to the multiquadric parameter) for interpolation by multiquadric functions carries over to least squares approximation. Sivakumar and Ward <ref> [SW93] </ref> have given upper bounds for the norms of the inverses of the normal equations associated with the least squares approximation problem. We now describe recent results on least squares approximation to scattered data using multi-quadric functions.

Reference-contexts: However Wu has recently established that rotated B-splines of order 2m are not positive definite on any R d for d &gt; 1 [Wu94a]. Therefore, interpolants based on rotated B-splines could lead to a singular problem. Schaback and Wendland <ref> [SW94] </ref> established that Euclidean hats and radialized tensor-product B-splines are positive definite radial basis functions with compact support and therefore guarantees the solvability of the interpolation problem. Euclidean hats are polynomial functions only in odd dimensional spaces. Radialized tensor-product B-splines are not polynomials and are somewhat difficult to compute.

Reference-contexts: A brief discussion on these two popular variations of the scattered data interpolation problem is included for 3 the sake of completeness. We refer the reader to <ref> [Alf89, Nie93d, ND91, NT94a, NT94b, Tve91] </ref> for scattered volumetric data modeling. Third, an attempt has been made to focus on relatively recent techniques of scattered data interpolation, although for the sake of completeness, brief descriptions or appropriate references for older techniques are presented. <p> There are several variations of this technique including color-blended contours that allow the user to observe both the contour curves and the behavior of the function between the contour curves [FLN90a]. Contour plots were also used extensively by Tvedt <ref> [Tve91] </ref> in his evaluation of trivariate schemes for interpolation. His computer program (called Slice Viewer) gives the user a thumbnail display of the contours of 20 slices parallel to a chosen coordinate plane for each of the parent function, the interpolation function, and the error. <p> The quality of interpolants can mean any combination of different characteristics that the user may consider important. An initial step was taken in this direction by by Tvedt <ref> [Tve91] </ref> who used contour plots in his evaluation of trivariate schemes for interpolation [NT94a, NT94b]. More recently, several new techniques for visual comparison of surface and volumetric interpolants have been presented [LSPW96, LJZU97]. <p> There is much that remains untested even for the two popular variations of the surfaces-on-surfaces problems - trivariate (or volumetric) scattered data problem and the function-on-surface problem. For example, although the study conducted by Nielson and Tvedt <ref> [Tve91, NT94a, Nie93d] </ref> compares nine trivariate schemes (Shepard's method, modified quadratic Shepard method, volume splines, multiquadric method without linear precision, multiquadric with linear precision, local volume splines, piecewise linear on tetrahedra, and a C 1 method on tetrahedra) to 54 sets of data (6 configurations of points and 9 functions sampled

Reference-contexts: All these radial basis function methods can however lead to a poorly conditioned system of equations for large data sets as in the planar case involving merely more than 200 points [PE90]. For the case of sphere, pseudosplines proposed by Wahba <ref> [Wah81] </ref> seem very well behaved. We also refer the reader to a very nice survey on spherical splines that use zonal functions with small and scalable support [FSF97].

Reference-contexts: Tensor product surfaces of parametric degree mfin always have at least 2mn base points. S-patches (which have base points) and another rational multisided generalization of Bernstein-Bezier surfaces with base points have been used to fill holes <ref> [LD90, War92] </ref>. In the reverse direction, the procedure for converting algebraic surfaces into rational parametric form is known as parametrization. For n &gt; 3, there always exists an algebraic surface of degree n that does not have a rational parametric representation of any degree at all [SAG84].

Reference-contexts: Remarks: One of the greatest challenges with the subdivision techniques is to establish the exact criteria on the set of subdivision rules that yield nice properties for the limiting subdivision surface <ref> [Rei95, War95] </ref>. The proofs to establish that the limiting surface exists, and is continuous or tangent plane continuous are often very long, laborious and subtle. Systematic attempts have been made by several researchers to both simplify and improve upon the existing results.

Reference-contexts: The choice of the support radius is critical in these applications. Increasing the support radius improves the quality of the results at the cost of more contributions in each support. 27 28 Wendland <ref> [Wen95] </ref> has constructed further instances of smooth compactly supported positive definite radial basis functions. Moreover, for a specific dimension d, these functions possess the lowest possible degree among all piecewise polynomial compactly supported radial functions, which are positive definite on R d and of a given degree of smoothness.

Reference-contexts: Clearly a simpler patch is required, and there are several alternatives. The Clough- Tocher patch can be extended to tetrahedra [Alf84] using piecewise polynomials of degree five, with four tetrahedra in the split. There is an extension of the Clough-Tocher patch to n-dimensions, by Worsey and Farin <ref> [WF87] </ref>. There is also a generalization of the Powell-Sabin split [PS77] using piecewise quadratic polynomials, by Worsey and Piper [WP88], and while this offers easy exact contouring, the patch subdivides the tetrahedron into 24 subtetrahedra. Nielson and Opitz [NO92] generalized the side-vertex scheme [Nie79] to a face-vertex scheme for tetrahedra.

Reference-contexts: Another popular radial basis function with compact support is rotated cubic B-splines. However Wu has recently established that rotated B-splines of order 2m are not positive definite on any R d for d &gt; 1 <ref> [Wu94a] </ref>. Therefore, interpolants based on rotated B-splines could lead to a singular problem.

Reference-contexts: Euclidean hats are polynomial functions only in odd dimensional spaces. Radialized tensor-product B-splines are not polynomials and are somewhat difficult to compute. Recently, Wu has constructed compactly supported positive definite radial basis functions that are piecewise polynomials with breakpoints only at zero and at the boundary of the support <ref> [Wu94b] </ref>. The construction starts with functions f k (x) = (1 x 2 ) k + ; x 2 R, l 0. Univariate convolutions of these functions are taken as follows: k;0 (x) = (f k fl f k )(x). <p> Therefore, for l &gt; 0, singularities at the boundary are less severe than the singularities at the zero. This property has a very positive effect on the visual appearance of the solutions. Explicit formulas for many of these radial basis functions appear in <ref> [Wu94b] </ref>, for example, up to constant multiples, 2;1 = (1 r) 4 + (4 + 16r + 12r 3 + 3r 3 ) + (6 + 36r + 82r 2 + 72r 3 + 30r 4 + 5r 5 ). 3;1 is a C 4 function at the zero, C 5

Reference-contexts: For smooth interpolation it is then necessary to have a function defined on each tetrahedron (a patch) that matches value and first derivatives across boundaries to adjacent tetrahedra. This can be achieved by various methods. Rescorla [Res87] uses a ninth degree patch due to Zen isek <ref> [Zen73] </ref>, with 220 degrees of freedom and requiring derivatives as high as fourth order to be estimated. Clearly a simpler patch is required, and there are several alternatives. The Clough- Tocher patch can be extended to tetrahedra [Alf84] using piecewise polynomials of degree five, with four tetrahedra in the split.
