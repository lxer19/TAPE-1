Abstract: In this paper, we steer wheeled nonholonomic systems that can be represented in a so-called chained form. Sufficient conditions for converting a multiple-input system with nonholonomic velocity constraints into a multiple-chain, single-generator chained form via state feedback and a coordinate transformation are presented along with sinusoidal and polynomial control algorithms to steer such systems. Our example is the three-input nonholonomic system of a fire truck, or tiller truck. In this three-axle system, the control inputs are the steering velocities of both the first and third (or tiller) axles and the forward driving velocity of the truck. Simulation results are given for parallel parking, left hand turning, right hand turning, and changing lanes. Comparison is made to the same vehicle without tiller steering.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we convert systems with more than two inputs into a chained form with more than one chain. The method we present for transforming a drift-free, nonholonomic system into chained form is analogous to the method for exact linearization of a nonlinear system presented in <ref> (Isidori 1989) </ref>. A method for steering chained form systems with sinusoids was first stated in (Murray and Sastry 1990). Other practical and efficient methods for steering include polynomial controls (Tilbury, Murray, and Sastry 1993) and piecewise constant controls (Monaco and fl Supported in part by NSF-IRI 9014490. <p> implies [f; g] 2 : Deriving conditions to transform a nonholonomic system with two or more inputs into chained form is not difficult if we consider the method for exact linearization of a nonlinear system with drift via state feedback and a coordinate transformation as presented in Chapter 5 of <ref> (Isidori 1989) </ref>. In analogy to this method, we state and prove the following sufficient conditions for transforming a three-input, drift-free, nonholonomic system to chained form. The appendix extends this to an (m + 1)-input system. <p> The proof is in the appendix. Remark 1. The condition that G 0 ; : : : ; G n1 all be involutive is somewhat redundant, as in the exact linearization conditions in <ref> (Isidori 1989) </ref> Section 5.2.6, since the involutivity of some distributions in the sequence may imply the involutivity of others. Remark 2.
