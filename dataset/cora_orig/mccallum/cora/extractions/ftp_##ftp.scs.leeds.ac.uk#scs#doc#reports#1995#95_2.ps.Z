Reference-contexts: Sometimes this is part of a `watching brief' exercised by those interested in general feedback issues (which we discuss in Section 5), but often colleagues will assist in delivery of modules as part of a course team <ref> [1] </ref>. This form of peer support among staff is proving to be of great value as the pressures of delivery to large classes develop. `Mistakes': Results of module mis-registration usually these users do not read much of material for which they are not registered.

Reference-contexts: The School has swollen considerably along with most of HE in the UK, with an undergraduate FTE load of 326 in 1989/90, 411 in 1992/3 and 510 in the current year, 1994/5. 1 The problems of swelling numbers are well documented <ref> [3, 13] </ref>, provoking a breakdown in communication between staff and students and the slow disintegration of what had been an `academic family' atmosphere as a result, the informal feedback mechanisms which had been well established and successful in less pressured days started to break down at the same time as problems

Reference-contexts: Simultaneously, assessment exercises both internal and external (HEFCE teaching assessment, and professional bodies' validation) made the monitoring of the student experience a School deliverable <ref> [4] </ref>, together with evidence of having solicited and responded to feedback, with the multiple aims of syllabus evolution and improvement (long term development), improvement of staff performance (e.g., correction of delivery problems), and attention to immediate problems (short term particularly important in a heavily equipment based subject area, where failure of

Reference-contexts: It is noticeable that downright rudeness is often evident even among finalists, who have either not learned better ways, or chosen not to adopt them. Of course, the same bluntness is witnessed in telephone conversations when antagonists are spared the face-to-face conversation. It has been observed <ref> [5, 15] </ref> that electronic bulletin boards fit into a hierarchical distancing model of communication ranging from numeric documents, via written documents and telephones, up to face-to-face communication, the scale increasing in richness and observed courtesy.

Reference-contexts: The number of `me too' mes 29 sages is testimony to this. Further, much of the problem solving observed comes from other enrolled students, providing an informal and automatic form of peer tutoring whose benefits to the learning process are well known but often hard to facilitate <ref> [7] </ref>. At the very least, we have created an automatic support network accessible pseudo anonymously and automatically to dozens, and sometimes hundreds. Students in other years: Activity on bulletin boards from non-enrolled students came as a surprise and is currently underexploited.

Reference-contexts: Comprehensive traffic and loading statistics are maintained worldwide an index to them may be found via anonymous FTP from sri.com in the file pub/netinfo/network-map-locations. We are well aware that bulletin boards have been in routine use in HE for many years (for example, <ref> [8] </ref>), and do not suppose that the system we present here or the results derived from it are unique, but are unaware of content analysis in the context of academic departments being conducted elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: The collection and use of feedback from classes is playing an increasingly important role in HE, but is known to be fraught with problems in areas of reliability and validity <ref> [12] </ref>. Using traditional mechanisms, the logistics of feedback collection and processing from large classes are formidable, and highly dependent on question formulation, which in turn is dependent on the intended purpose of the feedback.

Reference-contexts: A further application of the medium already in hand is an `electronic seminar' which delivers material by requiring the students to debate journal articles on specially created newsgroups; this idea has been piloted with some success during the academic year 1993/4, and will be repeated with improvements during 1994/5 <ref> [14] </ref>. 35 Routine use of bulletin boards as an integral part of teaching delivery is simple within existing technology, has a profound effect on that delivery and on the learners' attitudes, and could without difficulty be extended to any department able to provide bulk computer access to its students. 7 Acknowledgements

Reference-contexts: A comparable study has been made of the use of electronic bulletin boards in a company environment <ref> [15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This work has obvious applications inside and outside our own domain. Work has also been conducted on automatic content analysis of various forms of message. Work has been done on electronic mail messages <ref> [16] </ref>, a domain of clear similarity to our own, by extending NLP approaches to the analysis of free prose `stories'. Mail is not (usually) a broadcast mechanism (single writer, multiple reader) in the manner of news, but the similarities in message content and style are marked. <p> These figures were derived by a hand classification of the traffic a tiresome and time-consuming task.

Patel <ref> [16] </ref> in analysing electronic mail used categories such as `Specific topic', `Answer', `Question', `Query', `Meeting', `Courses' which bear some similarity to those we use. 21 The correspondence between posting of problems and their (putative) solution is easy to see Figure 6 illustrates this in the instance of technical requests to the
