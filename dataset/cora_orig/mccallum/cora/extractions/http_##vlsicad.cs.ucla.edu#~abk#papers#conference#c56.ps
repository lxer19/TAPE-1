Abstract: This paper gives new methods for calculating the time-domain response for a finite-length distributed RC line. We begin with the solution for diffusion in a semi-infinite distributed RC line [4, 12] and apply the method of images (reflections) to obtain the voltage response for a finite-length RC line. Second, we describe a general approach for calculating the time-domain response for finite RC lines with source and load impedances. Next, we obtain new approximate analytical expressions for the voltage response in a finite RC line with resistive source and capacitive load. Delay estimates using this method are very close to SPICE-computed delays; we compare against both SPICE and the recent method of [12] which calculates delays in an RC line with capacitive load. Our method is simple; for higher accuracy in the response, additional terms can be computed using numerical techniques.

Reference-contexts: The open-ended finite RC transmission line is widely analyzed in, e.g., [11, 14, 13]. The standard approach is to first calculate the transfer function; then, by approximating the transfer function both transform-domain and time-domain responses are obtained for such simple cases as a short-circuit or perfectly matched load <ref> [11, 14, 1, 10] </ref>. Using a different approach to invert the Laplace transform of the response, [9, 5, 12] have all obtained the exact time-domain response for a finite-length open-ended RC line.

Reference-contexts: In a finite RC line (Figure 3), the diffusion equation solu tion of Equation (3) can be viewed as an incident propagation of voltage due to a step input. The Laplace transform of this incident voltage propagation <ref> [3] </ref> is V I (x; s) = V 0 s e R x C x s . The total voltage on the line is the summation of the incident diffusion component plus reflected diffusion components due to discontinuities at the source (S) and load (L).
