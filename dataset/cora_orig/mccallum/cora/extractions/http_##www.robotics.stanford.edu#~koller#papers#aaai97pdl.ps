Abstract: Knowledge representation languages invariably reflect a trade-off between expressivity and tractability. Evidence suggests that the compromise chosen by description logics is a particularly successful one. However, description logic (as for all variants of first-order logic) is severely limited in its ability to express uncertainty. In this paper, we present P-CLASSIC, a probabilistic version of the description logic CLASSIC. In addition to terminological knowledge, the language utilizes Bayesian networks to express uncertainty about the basic properties of an individual, the number of fillers for its roles, and the properties of these fillers. We provide a semantics for P-CLASSIC and an effective inference procedure for probabilistic subsumption: computing the probability that a random individual in class C is also in class D. The effectiveness of the algorithm relies on independence assumptions and on our ability to execute lifted inference: reasoning about similar individuals as a group rather than as separate ground terms. We show that the complexity of the inference algorithm is the best that can be hoped for in a language that combines description logic with Bayesian networks. In particular, if we restrict to Bayesian networks that support polynomial time inference, the complexity of our inference procedure is also polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: A concept C is said to be subsumed by a concept D w.r.t. a terminology D T if C I D I for every model I of D T . In order to extend this semantics to P-CLASSIC, we have to provide an interpretation for the p-classes. Following <ref> (Halpern 1990) </ref>, we interpret a p-class as an objective (statistical) probability. 3 That is, each p-class will be associated with a distribution over the domain O I . Intuitively, a p-class P describes a random event: the selection of an individual from the domain.

Reference-contexts: One promising alternative with greater expressive power arises from our recent work on functional stochastic programs <ref> (Koller et al. 1997) </ref>. The basic idea is that we view each p-class as a stochastic function, and each individual as a call to the function for that appropriate p-class. A call to such a stochastic function chooses (randomly) the properties of the individual for which it is called.

Reference-contexts: Probabilities of deeper expressions are computed using the stored probabilities of the subexpressions. The second observation is that the probability that fi R holds is completely determined by the number and p-class of the R-fillers. In Bayesian network terms, this probability is d-separated <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref> from the rest of the network by NUMBER (R) and PC (R). Thus, we can add a node to the network representing the event fi R , with the parents NUMBER (R) and PC (R). <p> Next we calculate Prob P fl (mammal u ( 1 eats) u 8eats.mammal). In this 5 A polytree is a Bayesian network whose underlying undirected graph is acyclic, i.e., there is only one path of influence between any pair of nodes. Polytrees support linear time probabilistic inference <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref>.
