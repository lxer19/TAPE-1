Reference-contexts: The terms "stamp-covering" and "stamp-packing" are derived from a statement of some special cases of the problem of determining c (G) [4]. The problems in this paper are related to the well-studied "postage stamp" problem (see <ref> [1] </ref>), but only indirectly. For another example of a linkage between the "postage stamp" problem and graph labeling, see [3]. For a survey of results on graph labeling and a good bibliography, see [2].

Note that if c (G) denotes the number of non-empty connected induced subgraphs G, then c (G) c (G) p (G), and that the first inequality is strict if and only if the second is strict.

Reference-contexts: It was proved in <ref> [5] </ref> that c (P 5 ) = 13, and computer searches have shown that c (P 6 ) = 18, c (P 7 ) = 24, and c (P 8 ) = 29.
