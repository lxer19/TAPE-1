Reference-contexts: The adequacy of the resulting framework has been established by relating it to our formal characterization of the qualification problem. This adds another item to the list of ontological aspects which the fluent calculus|besides being closely related, in its basic form, to the Linear Connection Method <ref> [ Bibel, 1986 ] </ref> and reasoning about actions based on Linear Logic [ Girard, 1987; Masseron et al., 1993 ] |is capable of dealing with, such as non-deterministic and concurrent actions [ Bornscheuer and Thielscher, 1997 ] , indirect effects of actions [ Thielscher, 1997 ] , or continuous change [

Reference-contexts: In view of the required priority of the latter, we use the concept of Prioritized Default Logic <ref> [ Brewka, 1994; Rintanen, 1995 ] </ref> . While nonmonotonicity is inherent in the qualification problem, the basic fluent calculus augmented by the aforementioned solution to the ramification problem itself is monotone. <p> In what follows, we first recall the basics of standard Default Logic; thereafter, we give a brief but sufficiently detailed introduction to the aforementioned variant, namely, Prioritized Default Logic <ref> [ Brewka, 1994 ] </ref> ; and finally, we use these concepts to solve the qualification problem in the fluent calculus. Default Logic The fundamental idea in Default Logic is to extend classical logic, which is taken to encode precise knowledge, by expressions that formalize somehow vague, defeasible knowledge. <p> Yet an adequate solution to the qualification problem requires that, in case of conflicts, minimizing miraculous disqualifications is to be preferred over minimizing `abnormality' fluents. A recent variant of Default Logic, namely, Prioritized Default Logic <ref> [ Brewka, 1994 ] </ref> , serves this purpose by supporting the specification of (possibly partial) preference orderings among defaults. This ordering is exploited to select among the extensions of a default theory those in which the most preferred defaults have been applied.

Reference-contexts: in = but not in e x . 18 As shown in [ Holldobler and Thielscher, 1995 ] , a unification complete theory for our axioms AC1 can be obtained by computing, for each two terms s; t , some complete set cU AC1 (s; t) of AC1-unifiers (see, e.g., <ref> [ Stickel, 1981; Buttner, 1986 ] </ref> ) and taking the corresponding equational formula which is to the right of the entailment symbol in (26). In what follows, this theory will be called extended unique name assumption, abbreviated EUNA.

Reference-contexts: Finally, it needs to be mentioned that we gave emphasis only to the representational aspect of the qualification problem, as opposed to the computational aspect. That the latter is of equal importance has been pointed out in, e.g., <ref> [ Elkan, 1995 ] </ref> . Our analysis has revealed some hitherto unnoticed problems with the representational aspect and, to state the obvious, the computational aspect cannot be pursued without an appropriate representation of the problem.

Reference-contexts: The second basic entity in frameworks to reason about dynamic environments are actions , whose execution causes state transitions. Since stress shall lie on the qualification problem rather than on sophisticated methods of specifying the direct effects of actions, we employ a suitably simple, Strips-style <ref> [ Fikes and Nilsson, 1971; Lifschitz, 1986 ] </ref> notion of action specification.

Reference-contexts: The underlying principles of our theory, however, are sufficiently fundamental and general to not depend on this specific language. Thus these principles could equally well be employed in other, more elaborated formal theories of actions like, e.g., <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1993; 34 Sandewall, 1994; Thielscher, 1995 ] </ref> , to tackle the qualification problem. Likewise, existing ac-tion calculi may be enhanced on this basis in order that they become capable of dealing with abnormal action disqualifications.

Reference-contexts: Throughout the paper, we have taken action disqualifications as rendering the execution of the respective action physically impossible. A desirable refinement is to consider actions be disqualified as to producing a certain effect (c.f. <ref> [ Gelfond et al., 1991 ] </ref> , e.g.). This is accomplished with a simple, straightforward extension of our theory.

Reference-contexts: Our approach requires to accommodate indirect effects of actions, which is commonly referred to as the ramification problem <ref> [ Ginsberg and Smith, 1988a ] </ref> . Not being part of the respective action specification, indirect effects are consequences of general laws describing dependencies among components of the world description. <p> The problem of accommodating additional, indirect effects is commonly referred to as the ramification problem <ref> [ Ginsberg and Smith, 1988a ] </ref> . In the following section, we recall a solution to this problem which is based on so-called causal relationships and their posterior application to the result of the application of an action law.

Reference-contexts: Then its effect (viz. a potato in the tail pipe) implies that the second action will be (abnormally) disqualified. 1 According to <ref> [ Ginsberg and Smith, 1988b ] </ref> , this example is also due to McCarthy. 2 Aside from the fact that besides a clear tail pipe there are lots of other disqualifying, albeit unlikely, obstacles, how can we ensure that after checking the tail pipe it does not become clogged during us <p> As a side gain, this enables us to accommodate implicit strict preconditions of actions, which are not part of an action specification but derive from certain domain constraints (see Section 2.3). This is sometimes considered part of the qualification problem, e.g. in <ref> [ Ginsberg and Smith, 1988b; Lin and Reiter, 1994 ] </ref> . In Section 3, our action theory is extended by a formal account of the qualification problem in the way informally described above.

Reference-contexts: It has first been argued in [ Holldobler and Schneeberger, 1990 ] that this representation technique avoids extra axioms (e.g., frame axioms <ref> [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969; Green, 1969 ] </ref> ) to encode the general law of persistence: The effects of actions are modeled by manipulating terms like (24) through removal and addition of sub-terms.

Reference-contexts: In fact, a surprisingly simple example illustrates that the straightforward global minimization of abnormal disqualifications is inadequate. The example shows some similarities to the problem|first illustrated with the Yale Shooting example <ref> [ Hanks and McDermott, 1987 ] </ref> |which occurs when neglecting causality in tackling the frame problem. Imagine the following scenario (c.f. <p> We accomplish this by assuming, by default, the world starts normal, as 3 The Yale Shooting problem goes as follows (c.f. <ref> [ Hanks and McDermott, 1987 ] </ref> ): Suppose we call abnormal any change of a proposition's truth value during the execution of an action (as suggested in [ McCarthy, 1986 ] ).

Besides the proposal pursued in this paper, the only existing alternative to global minimization as a solution to the qualification problem is the concept of chronological ignorance [ Shoham, 1987; Shoham, 1988 ] .

Reference-contexts: Third, the formalism should not capitulate if faced with miraculous, i.e., inexplicable, disqualifications. The formal account of the qualification problem presented in this paper satisfies all of these requirements. In the second part, we develop, on the basis of the fluent calculus <ref> [ Holldobler and Schneeberger, 1990; Holldobler and Thielscher, 1995 ] </ref> , an action calculus which includes a proper treatment of abnormal disqualifications. Our encoding builds on the fluent calculus-based solution to the ramification problem developed in [ Thielscher, 1997 ] . <p> Our encoding employs the representation technique underlying the fluent calculus <ref> [ Holldobler and Schneeberger, 1990; Holldobler and Thielscher, 1995 ] </ref> . We begin by repeating the fluent calculus-based formalization of causal relationships developed in [ Thielscher, 1997 ] (Section 4.1). In Section 4.2, this calculus is extended by a suitable encoding of observations. <p> For instance, suppose S = fin-pipe (po); heavy (po); clogg is a state, then a term representation of S is ( in-pipe (po) ffi heavy (po) ) ffi clog (24) where the bar denoting negative fluent expressions is formally a unary function. It has first been argued in <ref> [ Holldobler and Schneeberger, 1990 ] </ref> that this representation technique avoids extra axioms (e.g., frame axioms [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969; Green, 1969 ] ) to encode the general law of persistence: The effects of actions are modeled by manipulating terms like (24) through removal and addition of sub-terms.

Reference-contexts: ` n (including t fg = ; ). 21 In order that the inequality of two state terms follows whenever they consist in different collections of fluent literals, an extension of the standard unique name assumption is needed, namely, the concept of unification completeness known from logic programming (see, e.g., <ref> [ Jaffar et al., 1984; Shepherdson, 1992; Thielscher, 1996 ] </ref> ): Let E be an equational theory, that is, a set of universally quantified equations.

Reference-contexts: For our calculus, we introduce a richer notion of fluents. A fluent is now an n-place predicate with arguments chosen from a given set of objects (or entities ) <ref> [ Sandewall, 1994; Kartha and Lifschitz, 1994 ] </ref> . This involves both a generalized concept of action laws and fluent formulas including quantifications. Definition 15 Let E be a finite set of symbols called entities .

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, it has already been shown elsewhere (e.g., <ref> [ Kautz, 1986; Sandewall, 1993; Stein and Morgenstern, 1994 ] </ref> ) that the applicability of chronological minimization is intrinsically restricted to domains which do not include non-deterministic information. This is best illustrated with the Tail Pipe Marauder scenario of Example 2.

Reference-contexts: disqualifications, which will be discussed later, in Section 3.3. 14 Instead of explicitly providing the "only-if" part in (11), i.e., disq (a) W i2I a f i , this could be implicitly obtained through circumscribing [ McCarthy, 1980 ] the predicate disq in a given set of domain constraints; c.f. <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1987 ] </ref> , where this idea is applied to strict preconditions of actions. 12 In words, if a disqualifying cause disappears and none of the alternative causes holds then disq (a) becomes false, (12), whereas disq (a) becomes true through the appearance of any disqualifying cause, (13).

Reference-contexts: We assume that the following four functions Res k are defined accordingly, i.e., wrt. the underlying causal model in the example. 16 This phenomenon is called restricted monotonicity in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1993 ] </ref> ; see also Section 5. 15 causal explanation. Our key example, in particular, is now treated in the expected way. Namely, any potential abnormal disqualification preventing us from putting a potato into the tail pipe is assumed away, for there is no evidence to the contrary. <p> Our theory moreover accommodates miraculous disqualifications, which need to be assumed whenever an action disqualification cannot be explained even if abnormal circumstances are granted. Consequently, miraculous disqualifications are minimized with higher priority. Assuming away by default abnormal or miraculous disqualifications is an inherently nonmono-tonic process. In <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1993 ] </ref> , a property called restricted monotonicity has been claimed generally desirable in theories of actions. A formalism possesses this property if additional observations can only increase the set of observations that are entailed by a domain description.

Reference-contexts: It was again McCarthy who two decades later pointed out a key problem in this context which occurs whenever agents need to reason about actions in other than artificial environments, where complete knowledge of all relevant facts cannot be assumed: The qualification problem <ref> [ McCarthy, 1977 ] </ref> arises from the fact that generally the successful execution of actions depends on many more conditions than we are usually aware of. <p> Moreover, it is often difficult if not impossible to even think of all conceivable disqualifications in advance <ref> [ McCarthy, 1977 ] </ref> . Assuming away so-called abnormal disqualifications by default naturally implies that if further knowledge hints at such unexpected disqualifications, then we have to withdraw the previous conclusion that the action in question is qualified. Thus the entire process is intrinsically nonmonotonic. <p> Thus the entire process is intrinsically nonmonotonic. As a consequence, McCarthy's proposal was to employ circumscription with the aim of minimizing abnormal disqualifications <ref> [ McCarthy, 1977; McCarthy, 1980; McCarthy, 1986 ] </ref> . Little has been achieved since then towards formally integrating this concept into a specific action formalism, or towards an assessment of its range of applicability.

[ Lifschitz, 1987 ] , where this idea is applied to strict preconditions of actions. 12 In words, if a disqualifying cause disappears and none of the alternative causes holds then disq (a) becomes false, (12),

Given that shooting at a turkey with a loaded gun causes the former to drop dead, we would expect exactly this to happen when we start with the gun loaded, wait for a short period, and then shoot.

Reference-contexts: As opposed to the situation calculus [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969; Reiter, 1991 ] , the fluent calculus employs structured state terms, each of which consists in a collection of all fluent literals that are true in the state being represented. To this end, fluent literals are reified <ref> [ Quine, 1960 ] </ref> , i.e., formally represented as terms. These terms are connected via a special binary function, which is illustratively denoted by ffi and written in infix notation.

Reference-contexts: Our encoding builds on the fluent calculus-based solution to the ramification problem developed in [ Thielscher, 1997 ] . Since the qualification problem requires some sort of nonmonotonic feature, we employ default rules in the sense of <ref> [ Reiter, 1980 ] </ref> to formalize the initial normality assumptions as well as the assumption that miraculous disqualifications do not occur. In view of the required priority of the latter, we use the concept of Prioritized Default Logic [ Brewka, 1994; Rintanen, 1995 ] . <p> The nonmonotonic extension of the fluent calculus we propose in the sequel is based on the machinery of Default Logic <ref> [ Reiter, 1980 ] </ref> . More precisely, the formulas W FC are taken as the foundational axioms of the default theory to be constructed, and so-called default rules are used to express the necessary defeasible assumptions of normality. <p> Once there are no more applicable defaults left, the deductive closure of the resulting set of formulas constitutes an extension. An extension may be regarded as one conceivable view on the state of affairs. The formal definition is as follows: Definition 25 <ref> [ Reiter, 1980 ] </ref> Let = (D; W ) be a default theory, and let E be a set of closed formulas.

Reference-contexts: It is assumed, also for the sake of clarity, that if f ab 2 F ab F , then any instance f ab (e 1 ; : : : ; e n ) expresses abnormal circumstances, thus is subject to minimization. As opposed to the situation calculus <ref> [ McCarthy and Hayes, 1969; Reiter, 1991 ] </ref> , the fluent calculus employs structured state terms, each of which consists in a collection of all fluent literals that are true in the state being represented.

Reference-contexts: The underlying principles of our theory, however, are sufficiently fundamental and general to not depend on this specific language. Thus these principles could equally well be employed in other, more elaborated formal theories of actions like, e.g., <ref> [ Gelfond and Lifschitz, 1993; 34 Sandewall, 1994; Thielscher, 1995 ] </ref> , to tackle the qualification problem. Likewise, existing ac-tion calculi may be enhanced on this basis in order that they become capable of dealing with abnormal action disqualifications.

Reference-contexts: For an appropriate treatment of indirect effects we will adopt the approach to the ramification problem proposed in <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> , which incorporates a suitable notion of causality. <p> In the second part, we develop, on the basis of the fluent calculus [ Holldobler and Schneeberger, 1990; Holldobler and Thielscher, 1995 ] , an action calculus which includes a proper treatment of abnormal disqualifications. Our encoding builds on the fluent calculus-based solution to the ramification problem developed in <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> . Since the qualification problem requires some sort of nonmonotonic feature, we employ default rules in the sense of [ Reiter, 1980 ] to formalize the initial normality assumptions as well as the assumption that miraculous disqualifications do not occur. <p> In Section 2.2, we then recall the causality-based solution to the ramification problem proposed in <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> . <p> In <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> , it has been proposed to regard the resulting collection of fluent literals, obtained after having applied an action law as described in Definition 3, merely as an intermediate state, which requires additional computation accounting for possible indirect effects. 10 More specifically, a single indirect effect is <p> See <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> for a detailed comparison. 7 The intended reading is the following: Under condition , the (previously obtained, direct or in-direct) effect " triggers the indirect effect % . <p> The reason for employing and manipulating the second component, E , is that identical intermediate states S can be reached by different effects E , each of which may require a different, sometimes opposite treatment (see <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> for details). <p> While the order in which causal relationships are applied might be crucial insofar as a different ordering may allow for a different set of causal relationships be applied, we have order independence in case a unique set of relationships is used to obtain a successor state (see <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> for details). Yet it is important to realize that neither uniqueness nor the existence of a successor state is guaranteed in general; that is, (a; S) may contain several elements or may be empty. <p> While clearly there is a close correspondence between these causal relationships and the underlying domain constraint, not every causal relationship suggested from a pure syntactical point of view by a domain constraint is desirable. 11 In <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> , we have argued that since the mere domain constraints do not provide sufficient information to exclude unintended causal relationships, additional domain knowledge is required as to possible causal influences between fluents. <p> Our encoding employs the representation technique underlying the fluent calculus [ Holldobler and Schneeberger, 1990; Holldobler and Thielscher, 1995 ] . We begin by repeating the fluent calculus-based formalization of causal relationships developed in <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> (Section 4.1). In Section 4.2, this calculus is extended by a suitable encoding of observations. <p> The following crucial properties of EUNA show how, respectively, the subset relation and the set difference and union operations can be modeled on the term level. This will later be exploited when manipulating state terms according to action laws and causal relationships. Proposition 16 <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> Let A; B be two sets of fluent literals. 1. IF A B then EUNA j= 9z: t A ffi z = t B , else EUNA j= 8z: t A ffi z 6= t B . 2. <p> This formalization has been proved adequate in the following sense: Proposition 17 <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> Let s be a collection of fluent literals, then EUNA; (27); (28) j= State (s) iff there exists some state S such that EUNA j= s = t S , else EUNA; (27); (28) j= :State (s) . <p> For notational convenience, we will write Holds (F; s) to denote this encoding of a fluent formula F . Given the definition of Holds , (27), and the extended unique name assumption, this encoding is correct: Proposition 19 <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> Let F be a fluent formula and S a state, then EUNA; (27) j= Holds (F; t S ) iff F is true in S , else EUNA; (27) j= :Holds (F; t S ) . <p> To summarize, let F C ramif denote the union of EUNA with the definitions of Holds (27), Possible (29), Action (30), Causes (31), Ramify (32), and Successor (33), based on given sets of domain constraints, action laws, and causal relationships. The following correctness result is known: Theorem 22 <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> Let F C ramif be the encoding of sets of, respectively, domain constraints, action laws, and causal relationships. Furthermore, let S; S 0 be two states, a an action name of arity m , and e e a sequence of entities of length m . <p> Finally, if an instance Miracle (a fl ) is true, then this indicates that the action sequence a fl is miraculously disqualified. As a notational convention, if a fl is a (possibly empty) action sequence and a an action, then [a fl ja] denotes the action sequence 20 See <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> for how Definition 7 can be extended to cope with domain constraints that contain quantifications. 27 which consists in a fl followed by a . <p> its basic form, to the Linear Connection Method [ Bibel, 1986 ] and reasoning about actions based on Linear Logic [ Girard, 1987; Masseron et al., 1993 ] |is capable of dealing with, such as non-deterministic and concurrent actions [ Bornscheuer and Thielscher, 1997 ] , indirect effects of actions <ref> [ Thielscher, 1997 ] </ref> , or continuous change [ Herrmann and Thielscher, 1996 ] . Besides the proposal pursued in this paper, the only existing alternative to global minimization as a solution to the qualification problem is the concept of chronological ignorance [ Shoham, 1987; Shoham, 1988 ] .
