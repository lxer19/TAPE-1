Abstract: Research and development in robotics and industrial automation has created a need for good grasp planning algorithms for a variety of object shapes and hand types. This in turn has stimulated research on the inherent computational geometry of grasping. The purpose of this paper is to survey some of the recent grasping results, algorithms, and ideas. We will place particular emphasis on research involving the synthesis of optimal grasps. We include a brief discussion of a few of the many problems that arise in the context of grasping. The main focus of this paper, however, is on the following problem and its variants: Given a description of an object (e.g. Is the object concave or convex? Is it a polygonal object or is it curved?) and a gripper (e.g. How many fingers/contacts does the gripper have? What type of contacts are they? Point contacts? Is there friction? What positions can the fingers obtain?), find an "optimal" grasp of the object with the gripper or determine that there is no feasible grasp of the object. As we will see, even the notion of optimal will not always be measured by the same metrics, making a general solution difficult if not impossible to find.

However, it was not until the mid-Eighties that mul-tifingered hands began to show up in laboratories and the importance of grasping research grew. Within only a few years, grasping papers were appearing in record numbers at almost every robotics and control conference.

Additional work by several others showed methods for testing the stability of a grasp, namely if it was form/force-closure 6 . <p> The use of maximal inscribed circles is not a new idea, in fact it was first utilized in a proof by Baker, Fortune, and Gross <ref> [BFG85] </ref> in the context of stable grasps (not form-closure) of polygons. Throughout their analysis, they are forced to handle numerous special cases. The most common special case occurs when the maximal circle touches the boundary of the object at only two points.

Reference-contexts: a frictionless grip which resists any external forces and torques which move the object to a significantly different spatial position. 3 Friction throughout this paper refers to a simple Coulomb friction model between the finger and object. 4 Modeling Human Grasping Looking for a new direction in grasping research, Cutkosky <ref> [Cut89] </ref> decided that the grasping models that were currently being used for multifingered hands contained simplifications and assumptions that limited their application to manufacturing environments. Cutkosky, as well as other researchers at the time, saw the need to make more anthropomorphic hands (i.e. hands more closely resembling humans hands).

Reference-contexts: From before, we know that finding maximal independent contact regions reduces to solving a linear programming problem, making their overall so lution quite nice. 7 9 Optimal Grasps Ferrari and Canny <ref> [FC92] </ref> address the problem of computing optimal force-closure grasps of polygonal objects by computing a maximal ball included in the convex hull of the contact wrenches. <p> Most of the work in this areas that was presented in this paper have come out of research within the past year. In addition, work into formalizing a synthesis technique to accompany the 1992 paper <ref> [FC92] </ref> is in process by Mirtich and Canny. 11 Conclusion We have also seen that manipulation is complex, typically involving combinations of open and closed loop kinematic chains, non-holonomic constraints, redundant degrees of freedom, and singularities. <p> However, this fact has yet to be properly addressed and exploited in the grasping community. Finally, research pointed out by Ferrari and Canny <ref> [FC92] </ref> as well as others, moves grasping towards a new direction. This new research centers around the recent movement away from anthropomorphic hands towards specialized grippers and tool-changers. Such specialized tools are simpler in terms of kinematics and controllability, and far more accurate than a human like hands.

Reference-contexts: This means that large forces may be required by the result of their algorithm that are not obtainable or are so large that they deform and/or break the object and/or gripper. Finally, it is not robust to the uncertainties involved with real world multifingered hands. Markenscoff and Papadimitriou <ref> [MNP90] </ref> devote the majority of their work to showing the same results for minimum number of finger contacts for various grasps and contact types. However, their analysis does provide some new research in that it considers objects that include curved surfaces. <p> This leads to an algorithm, that can rapidly analyze any reasonably complex object and compute the optimum grip by examining a finite number of cases (growing as the cube of the number of sides of the polygon). In their analysis they run into special cases similar to those in <ref> [MNP90] </ref>. For two of those cases, concave vertices and parallel sides, they give special procedures for computing the optimum grip of a polygon with three fingers.

Using point contacts without friction, they present a technique for constructing a grasp with O (n) fingers in O (n) time when n is the number of faces of the object and the dimension of the object is fixed. The construction is a two step process.

Reference-contexts: Additional work by several others showed methods for testing the stability of a grasp, namely if it was form/force-closure 6 . With the groundwork layed out, research turned towards the automatic synthesis of such stable grasps. 6.1 Early Robust Grasping Early work in this area was done by Nguyen <ref> [Ngu88] </ref> in the late Eighties. Nguyen presented a fast and simple algorithm for directly constructing force-closure grasps based on the shape of the object. <p> In their analysis they run into special cases similar to those in [MNP90]. For two of those cases, concave vertices and parallel sides, they give special procedures for computing the optimum grip of a polygon with three fingers. Although their results are more general than Nguyen's <ref> [Ngu88] </ref>, the necessary consideration of special cases, make this a somewhat messy solution. 8 Robust Grasp Planning 8.1 2D Polygons with 3 Fingers Ponce and Faverjon obtained excellent results using a new approach to constructing three-finger force-closure grasps of polygonal objects [PF91]. <p> They consider a hand equipped with three hard-finger contacts from which they prove a sufficient condition for force-closure grasps leading to a system of linear constraints in the position of the fingers along the polygonal edges. Like Nguyen <ref> [Ngu88] </ref> for two finger grasps, they determine maximal segments of the object boundary where the fingers can be positioned independently while maintaining force-closure. The regions satisfying these constraints are found by a projection algorithm based on linear parameter elimination accelerated by simplex techniques. <p> This was an extension of Nguyen's work and like Nguyen, they characterize two-finger force-closure grasps by the fact that the line joining the contact points must lie within the friction cones at those points. As we have seen before in [PF91] and <ref> [Ngu88] </ref>, the linear form of the force-closure constraints in the polygonal case allowed for the design of fast and simple geometric algorithms for the constructing stable grasps. However, for smooth (and piecewise-smooth) curved objects, these constraints become highly nonlinear, calling for an approach of more algebraic nature to grasp synthesis. <p> However, as before, the number and degree of the equations involved make such an implementation difficult. 8.3 3D Polyhedra with 3 and 4 Fingers Ponce, Sullivan, Boissonnat, and Merlet [PSBM93] extend the approach of <ref> [Ngu88] </ref>, [PF91], and [FP91] to the synthesis of three- and four-finger force-closure grasps of three-dimensional polyhedral objects again using independent maximal grasp regions. <p> As a result, many assumptions had to be made to make the problem tractable. Yet, humans can perform such tasks easily suggesting that a simple approach exists. In addition, an interesting insight made by 8 Nguyen <ref> [Ngu88] </ref> and others, observed that larger fric-tion cones were produced when finger contacts were at edges or vertices of an object. This explains why people grasp objects at the edges and corners and why the contacting surface of human fingers need to be soft rather than hard like the fingernails.
