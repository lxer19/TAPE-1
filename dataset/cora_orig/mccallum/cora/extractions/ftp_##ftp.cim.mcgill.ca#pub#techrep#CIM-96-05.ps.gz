Reference-contexts: The nonlinear behavior observed in the open loop phase plot is almost totally cancelled for all amplitudes and frequencies, as seen in Figure 14. This result is particularly noteworthy given the well known difficulties caused by solid friction compensation in mechanical transmissions <ref> [1] </ref>. The resulting loopshap-ing controller may, in the present example, be given a simple physical interpretation: Its effect is equivalent to transmission stiffening, which in turns enhances the effectiveness of the feedback for friction compensation. This interpretation vividly illustrates the argument made in the previous section.

Reference-contexts: Hydraulic Actuator. This actuator is more fully described in <ref> [2] </ref>. It consists of a electromagnetically actuated jet-pipe hydraulic valve which is piggy-backed on a piston type hydraulic motor. Its dynamics are known to be quite complex, but following our black-box approach a discussion it not in order here.

Reference-contexts: The results are indeed quite encouraging and so are reported next for four different physical systems.

Reference-contexts: Among all the methods available, a most suitable one is the robust loopshaping method since we now have all the basic information in hand. The loopshaping technique will allows us to design a controller C (s) which precisely has the properties needed to achieve the objectives above <ref> [4] </ref>. It is not possible to chose the controller to be C (s) = ^ LP (s), even with the restriction that ^ LP (s) is stable and minimum phase, because it would neither be robust to approximations nor be proper.

Reference-contexts: Also in this case, as is shown in the phase plots and can be confirmed with the phase plot, there is a constant phase shift between the input and the output of about 3 degrees. This behavior is characteristic of a rate independent hysteresis <ref> [5] </ref>. The procedure described before was nevertheless followed, and a linear approximation to the plant was searched for. It was found that the linear part of the actuator could be matched perfectly in magnitude by a third order non-minimum 3. <p> The control law in this case was still able to compensate for some of the nonlinearity. It had been previously stated that a voltage driven piezoelectric actuator either requires a non-linear controller or a linear controller that commands actuator charge <ref> [5] </ref>.

Experimental Results The method is applied to four different actuators with varied characteristics. <p> The smallest one is as small as the resolution of the sensor or the actuator allowed, and the other is as large as possible, just before the saturation of the actuator. 3.1.

Reference-contexts: Observations. It has been observed that SISO nonlinear plants are amenable to decomposition into simpler components. A simple decomposition, originally suggested by Wiener [15], consists of cascading a linear filter with a static nonlinearity. This idea has been used, for example, in the system identification of biological phenomena <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. See [9] for an overview of this identification approach. An apparently complex input-output relationship may actually be represented as a dynamic linear system LP (s) followed by a static non-linear system N L (:), see Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: The design of linear controllers using the "describing function approach" often result in very conservative controllers due to fundamental assumptions <ref> [12, 10] </ref>. Finally, the quenching in closed loop of the resulting limit cycles with high levels of damping is detrimental to the system bandwidth [12]. We propose another approach to the design of linear controllers for this kind of plants.

Reference-contexts: More importantly, the robustness of the controller is not affected by the plant uncertainty. It is known that this particular plant is prone to create limit cycles in closed loop, and that there exists several nonlinearities <ref> [11] </ref>, which make control difficult. The approach described here, at least provides a systematic method for the selection of a feedback compensator. 3.3. Harmonic Drive. Harmonic drives are gear reductors which utilize a flexible output stage.

Reference-contexts: They are nevertheless ubiquitous in their application because of a reduced weight and compact packaging. Their nonlinear and time varying dynamics pose challenges for the robustness of the feedback controllers being applied to them <ref> [13] </ref>. Open loop responses are shown in figure 9. The cut off frequency varies from 100 rad/s for the large amplitude to 150 rad/s for the smallest amplitude. The damping factor is approximately 0.5 for a large input amplitude.
