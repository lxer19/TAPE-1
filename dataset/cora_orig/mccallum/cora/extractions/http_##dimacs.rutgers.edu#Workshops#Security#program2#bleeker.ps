Reference-contexts: 0 Introduction In their ground-breaking paper <ref> [BAN89] </ref> Burrows, Abadi and Needham give a formalism, BAN logic, that can be used to reason about security properties of protocols. There are, however, several implicit or informally described assumptions. Moreover, the semantics gets very little attention, and is mentioned only in a short, informal description.

Reference-contexts: There are, however, several implicit or informally described assumptions. Moreover, the semantics gets very little attention, and is mentioned only in a short, informal description. As pointed out by Syverson <ref> [Syv91] </ref>, having only an intuitive understanding of the semantics directly opposes the usual goal of having semantics at all: to see the logic as part of a system, and to be able to prove statements about a (more or less) existing model formally.
