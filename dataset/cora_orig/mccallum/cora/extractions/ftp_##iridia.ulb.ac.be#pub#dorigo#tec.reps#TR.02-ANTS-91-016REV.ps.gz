Abstract: A combination of distributed computation, positive feedback and constructive greedy heuristic is proposed as a new approach to stochastic optimization and problem solving. Positive feedback accounts for rapid discovery of very good solutions, distributed computation avoids premature convergence, and greedy heuristic helps the procedure to find acceptable solutions in the early stages of the search process. An application of the proposed methodology to the classical travelling salesman problem shows that the system can rapidly provide very good, if not optimal, solutions. We report on many simulation results and discuss the working of the algorithm. Some hints about how this approach can be applied to a variety of optimization problems are also given.

Reference-contexts: 3 (in this case n = 16, 25, 36, 49, 64) confirming in this way the complexity analysis presented in section 4. 5.7 Comparison with other approaches We compared the results of Ant-cycle with those obtained, on the same Oliver30 problem, by the other heuristics contained in the package "Travel" <ref> [2] </ref>. This package represents the distances among the cities as an integer matrix and so, in order to enable the comparison, we implemented an analogous representation in our system.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless we believe that the ant colony metaphor can be useful as a didactic tool to explain our ideas. 1 An autocatalytic <ref> [7] </ref>, i.e. positive feedback, process is a process that reinforces itself, in a way that causes very rapid convergence and, if no limitation mechanism exists, leads to explosion.

Reference-contexts: there is the length of the best tour identified by each heuristic, in the second and third columns the improvement on the corresponding first column solution as obtained by the 2-opt (exhaustive exploration of all the permutations obtainable from the basic one by exchanging 2 cities) and the LinKernighan heuristics <ref> [16] </ref>, respectively. Note how Ant-cycle consistently outperformed 2-opt, while its efficacy i.e., the effectiveness it has in finding very good solutions can be compared with that of Lin-Kernighan (even if our algorithm requires a longer computational time).
