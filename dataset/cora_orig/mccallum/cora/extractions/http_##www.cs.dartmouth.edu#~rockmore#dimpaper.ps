Title: Efficient Computation of Isotypic Pro jections for the Symmetric Group  
Author: PERSI DIACONIS AND DANIEL ROCKMORE

Abstract: Spectral analysis on the symmetric group S n calls for computing projections of functions defined on S n and its homogeneous spaces, onto invariant subspaces. In particular, for the analysis of partially ranked data, the appropriate homogeneous spaces are given as quotients by Young subgroups. Here the naive character theoretic approach to computing projections requires O(n n!) operations. In this paper two types of polynomial time algorithms (quadratic in the size of the homogeneous space) are presented for partially ranked data. The first approach makes use of a more careful organization of the character theoretic computation and is applicable to arbitrary finite groups and their homogeneous spaces. The second approach makes use of the techniques of the combinatorial Radon transform.

Reference-contexts: Babai and Ronyai [2] treat the problem of constructing a complete set by decomposing the group algebra. It is worth pointing out that more generally, it may also prove fruitful to view the problem of computing projections in the context of matrix algebras. Babai, Friedl and Stricker <ref> [1] </ref>, extending work of Friedl and Ronyai [16] show that deterministic polynomial time (in the dimension) algorithms exist for decomposing semisimple matrix algebras over number fields (closed under conjugate-transpose) into their simple components. There has been no investigation of the practicality of these algorithms. 2.4. The multiplicity-free case.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, for the permutation representations arising from quotients by Young subgroups, the decomposition into irreducibles is given by Young's Rule (cf. [18], section 14). For an arbitrary group, explicit matrix representations may not be known. Babai and Ronyai <ref> [2] </ref> treat the problem of constructing a complete set by decomposing the group algebra.

Reference-contexts: Their algorithm makes use of the fact that for distance transitive graphs, the spherical functions satisfy a three-term recurrence. See [15] for details. Such graphs may be also studied from the point of view of association schemes. Bannai and Ito <ref> [3] </ref> give a full treatment of the subject. The set of k-sets of an n-set naturally form a graph where two k-sets are joined if and only if they differ by a single element.

Reference-contexts: For example, ranking the top 10 movies (in order) out of 40 leads to data of the shape (30,1,1,...,1) (10 ones). Sample surveys and the "q-sort" data collected by psychologists leads to other shapes. In each case spectral analysis offers a systematic method of analysis ([10], <ref> [5] </ref>). Projections onto isotypic subspaces is a mainstay of the practical implementation of the spectral analysis approach to data. This generalizes to some degree the classical sums of squares decomposition of the standard ANOVA approach [13]. <p> Corollary 2.3.

As noted previously, assuming that this is a computation which is to be performed frequently, the character subsum calculation can be viewed as a "start-up" cost. The actual "interesting" computation takes only O ( n 2 ) operations.

Reference-contexts: The state takes about half of the total bet and splits the rest among the people choosing the winning 6-set.

The state is also interested in f (s) if there are no winners, the lottery is "rolled over" and betting activity increases.
