Abstract: This paper, describing a computer graphics tool for clinical vision, is the result of an effort in finding out the potential of and possible improvements to a tool to help opticians. The software prototype, the computer binocular kit, generates customized stereo pairs. The results of this collaborative research project show that the eye cooperation ability of a patient can be trained by exercising the eye muscles with the Binocular Kit. However, we want to leave open the possibility of combining the data of patient's eye convergence with other measurements of perceived sharpness and disparity of stereo pairs.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In our presentation to the First Workshop of Cybernetic Vision of 94, the Computer Binocular Kit was an aid to comprehend in space the retinal image we don't see <ref> [2] </ref>. The kit was a software system designed from a computer science point of view, but opthalmologists were consulted in Denmark and Brasil. Automatic refraction and computers are replacing old clinical methods, but this is an expensive revolution, especially for opthalmologists in the third world [1]. <p> These equations simple geometry gives a direct relation between the disparity of a point in the stereopairs and the distance of the apparent object. So by increasing the stereogram disparity one could increase apparent object distance from the observer. This statement should be corrected in Hess <ref> [2] </ref>, in tests interpretation. Notice the parallel effect in the size of objects behind the lenses of the myope and hy-permetrope, e.g. myope will increase disparity and its perceived object will have a "more-distant" effect, his lenses reduce the sizes of objects.

Reference-contexts: The first version of the prototype software, C-implemented in 93 by Tavora & Campos <ref> [3] </ref>, has all the features of a small computer graphics system. Stereo images of three dimensional objects, represented in homogeneous coordinates, could be transformed into 3D. The object and its transformations were animated in the anaglyph viewing. <p> Furthermore it suggested that an application of a dichoptic method of a computer generated stimuli could be used in vision clinic test. 2.1 Return In 1995, a Danish group [4] decided to develop an expert system to help opticians, starting from an analysis of the Computer Binocular Kit <ref> [3] </ref>. Finding out if it worked, both in theory and in practice, and finally seeing if it could be improved. Soren B. Carlsen and Dannie Kjeldgaard first implemented a restriction to the Computer Binocular Kit, instancing the figure entered always as the unit cube. <p> Then they implemented the kit in turbo C++ on a PC-platform, so it could be taken to opticians. Their initial tests [4] indicated the same data disparities as the tests of Tavora and Weber <ref> [3] </ref> for observers with myopia and hypermet-ropia. Discussing the tests with D.

The sensitive photoreceptors on the retina regenerate in seconds and the visual stimulus produced by eletromagnetic energy is interpreted by the brain. <p> Julesz proved that the main purpose of vergence is to bring the images within Panum's fusional area, where the central nervous system process of stereopsis can operate. 2.3 Open Problem The opticians interpretation of the tests led Carlsen and Kjeldgaard <ref> [4] </ref> to believe the Kit can only test for cooperation hability and to state that it's not possible to determine the need of wearing glasses by using the Kit. However there are some points about seeing that should be taken into consideration.

Reference-contexts: A postim-age in an area of the retina, that determines a location 30 degrees right of the center of the visual field (fovea visual direction), will remain always 30 degrees from the objects, which were fixed by the fovea during the successive eye movements <ref> [5] </ref>. We only have a clear perception of what is in our field of attention, the rest remains as a blur until the peripheral stimulus reaches a different value from those of the neighbours. <p> That is, when we become conscious then the object is located in subjective space according to the distance of this stimulated area on the retina from the fovea. Simultaneously, an eye movement of new foveal fixation will be signaled and that distance is the amplitude of this movement <ref> [5] </ref>. Stereopsis is based on the geometrical fact that two dimensional projections of a three dimensional object on the left and right retina differ in their horizontal positions; this is called retinal disparity, or binocular parallax. The binocular depth cues besides stereopsis are vergence and correlative accomodation. <p> However there are some points about seeing that should be taken into consideration. From Berry [7], who wrote in 1948 that there are quantitative relations among Vernier, real depth and stereoscopic depth ac-cuities, and also by Diaz and Dias <ref> [5] </ref> that there exists a strong correlation between stereoscopic and monocular accuities. Besides, one can differentiate normal patients from patients with microtropies. In addition,the corrective lenses only change the vergence, so that the image is formed on the retina, according to the refraction clinic tests of the patient.

Reference-contexts: When defocusing one stereoscopic field, even if the pattern printed out of focus is almost obliterated, stereopsis is still obtained and the fields will fuse in a sharp image. The blurred image serves only to convey the required disparity in formation and is then suppressed <ref> [6] </ref>.

Besides, one can differentiate normal patients from patients with microtropies. <p> Therefore there is a possibility of associating, to the customized disparity parameters obtained with the kit other measurements of perceived depth acuities. In the literature one can find formulas for the relation of the disparity of ste-reograms and the apparent depth of the perceived object <ref> [7, 8, 9] </ref>. These equations simple geometry gives a direct relation between the disparity of a point in the stereopairs and the distance of the apparent object. So by increasing the stereogram disparity one could increase apparent object distance from the observer. <p> The Vernier discrimination would not be affected by imbalance of the ocular muscle, because the Vernier performance is essentially monocular and does not depend on cooperation of the two eyes <ref> [7] </ref>. Therefore correlative accomodation (differencial focusing of the two eyes) data can so be obtained.

Reference-contexts: Instead of testing with anaglyphs, because the colors green and red don't have the same wave length, and that may interfere with the results of the refraction. Further, different tests using animated noise, like the tests made in <ref> [10] </ref>, as well as rivalry,diplopia and Panum area tests could be pursued with the Computer Binocular Kit, aiming to answer the question of the possibility of associating with the data of convergence of the eyes, other measurements of perceived sharpness and disparity of the stereo pairs.
