Abstract: An essential component in the execution of image-guided surgery is a hand-held probe whose spatial position is tracked during the procedure and displayed on a workstation-based three dimensions imaging system. This paper describes an experiment performed in order to compare the accuracy of a mechanically linked pointing device (FARO surgical arm) and an optical position tracker (OPTOTRAK) against a "gold standard".

The FARO Surgical Arm The FARO arm is a six degree of freedom articulated aluminum device <ref> [4] </ref>. A probe (Figure 1) is attached to the end. The probe is a 200 mm long cylinder with a thin shaft at the end. The articulated arm is passive which implies that the surgeon (or an assistant) manually moves it and holds it in a desired position.

Reference-contexts: The observed accuracy of the FARO surgical arm is about 1mm. B. The OPTOTRAK Position Tracker The OPTOTRAK is a position tracking device which tracks infrared light emitting diodes (LEDs) by three fixed CCD cameras <ref> [5] </ref>. The OPTOTRAK has a stated accuracy of 0.15 mm and a resolution of 0.01 mm at a distance of 2.5 m between the LED and the cameras. Low noise levels during tests yield a resolution of slightly greater than 0.01 mm.

Reference-contexts: The 50 OPTOTRAK and FARO arm measurements of each hole were taken with a stationary probe i.e., the orientation of the probe was constant and the LEDs directly faced the cameras. Independant tests by Northern Digital <ref> [6] </ref> on a larger 6 LED digitizing probe showed a similar level of accuracy for similar tests (maximum error of 0.11 mm and a standard deviation of 0.02 mm).
