Abstract: While lots of effort is done on behalf of the ATM Forum and the ITU stan-dardisation bodies in specifying the user network interface (UNI) for ATM's available bit rate (ABR) service the specification of the switch mechanisms will be left to the manufacturers. In this study some of the algorithms proposed for dynamically distributing the available bandwidth at the switches such as EPRCA, CAPC, the OSU scheme and a modified version of the MIT proposal are compared. In our investigations we will concentrate mainly on the fairness behaviour of the schemes, their complexity and their warm up periods. The work presented here is a description of our preliminary results. At this stage, we have mainly considered the fairness behaviour of the different schemes using a single test scenario.

Reference-contexts: The OSU as well as the CAPC schemes are more of congestion avoidance schemes that aim at driving the operation of the network toward the knee of the delay curve <ref> [1] </ref>. That is, these schemes aim at achieving an optimal overall performance with high bandwidth utilisation and low buffer usage and delay. 2.1 The Enhanced Proportional Rate Control Algorithm (EPRCA) The EPRCA [2] scheme computes a mean allowed cell rate (MACR) using exponential weighted averaging.

In her work [6] Charny shows that two iterations are usually sufficient enough to reach convergence.

Reference-contexts: A threshold is used only to indicate the very congested state in which the sources are asked to rapidly decrease their rates. 2.2 The MIT Scheme The original MIT scheme was proposed by Charny <ref> [6] </ref> in her master thesis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. With this scheme the fair share is computed using an iterative procedure. Initially, the fair share is set to the link bandwidth divided by the number of active VCs. <p> In her work <ref> [6] </ref> Charny shows that two iterations are usually sufficient enough to reach convergence. While this proposal fullfills the fairness requirements of the switch mechanisms it requires for the fair share computation order n operations with n as the number of VCs for each received RM cell.

Reference-contexts: For ATM switches supporting thousands of VCs the computational overhead becomes extremely large and can not be done by currently available hardware. Kalampoukas et al. <ref> [7] </ref> present therefore an allocation algorithm that is based on the one introduced by Anna Charny but requires only (1) operations. This is reached by keeping track of the available bandwidth for the ABR connections.

In this scheme the switches measure their input rate over a fixed averaging interval that is counted in cells [9].

Reference-contexts: In this scheme the switches measure their input rate over a fixed averaging interval that is counted in cells <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> This problem can be solved by using larger measurement intervals. However, this reduces the reactivity of the algorithm and leads to longer transient periods. Actu--ally, in our tests we already used a measurement interval of 60 cells which is already twice as large as the suggested value in <ref> [9] </ref>. Another problem with the OSU scheme is its unfairness towards short distance traffic during overload periods. We have mentioned that the switches write the fair rate share in the backward RM cells.

Reference-contexts: assure fairness and a minimal cell rate the active connections must at least re ceive the minimum fair share that is calculated as follows: Fair share = Target rate number of active connections 2.4 Congestion Avoidance using Proportional Control (CAPC) Basicly, this algorithm developed by Andy Barnhart from Huges Systems <ref> [10] </ref> shows a great similarity to the OSU scheme described in sec. 2.3. Just as in the OSU scheme the switches set a target utilisation slightly below 1 and compute the input rate over averaging intervals. With the computed input rate a load factor (z) can then be calculated. <p> For the case of an initial cell rate as high as the peak cell rate we notice, however, a bug in the algorithm as it was described in <ref> [10] </ref>. Due to the long lasting congestion at the switches caused by the high initial cell rate the fair share value is reduced several times until its finally represented by 0. In this case the fair share value will remain 0 even if all the sources reduced their rates.

Reference-contexts: sources that can always send with the maximum allowed cell rate and impose thereby the most stringent constraints on the network. 4 Simulation Results of the Fairness Performance As a fairness criterion we used the max-min fairness definition as it was described in the ATM Forum traffic management specification 4.0 <ref> [11] </ref>. With this definition a connection's bandwidth request is either satisfied by the switch or set to the fair share calculated by the switch.
