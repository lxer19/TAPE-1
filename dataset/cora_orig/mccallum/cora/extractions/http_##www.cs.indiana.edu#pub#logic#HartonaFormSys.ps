Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction 1.1 Outline of The Theory of Form Systems Aczel <ref> [2] </ref> introduced a theory of form systems, as part of a long term project to provide a mathematical framework for situation theory. Further development has been carried out by Lunnon [7]. <p> When X = V , where V is the universe of all possible objects of our metatheory, the form system is called an ontology. Two of the basic results of the elementary theory, the Duality theorem and the Representation theorem, are proven in <ref> [2] </ref>. The duality theorem is a characterization result, characterizing wf and af universes in terms of initial and final objects in a certain category. Existence of wf and af universes follows from results in [1]. <p> It does, however, assume some basic familiarity with category theory, indeed one of a very elementary kind. For the reader unfamiliar with the subject, any standard introductory reference would suffice to provide the background needed. 2 Form Systems 2.1 The Category of Form Systems Aczel <ref> [2] </ref> defines a form system over a class X (an X-form system) as a structure A = (A; C; :), where, for each a 2 A; Ca X is a set and if : Ca ! X is a map then :a 2 A and the following axioms hold: 1 A <p> X (an X-form system) as a structure A = (A; C; :), where, for each a 2 A; Ca X is a set and if : Ca ! X is a map then :a 2 A and the following axioms hold: 1 A notion of free ontology is obtained in <ref> [2] </ref> by reformulating the notion of an ontology as that of a many sorted algebra. This lead could have been followed to obtain a notion and proof of the existence of free form systems and, subsequently to therefrom derive the representation theorem. <p> It is straightforward to verify that the axioms listed above hold for these examples. Recalling some of the terminology in <ref> [2] </ref>, an ontology is a V -form system (where V is the class of all possible objects of our metatheory) and A = (A; C; :) is an elementary universe if it is an A-form system. <p> As a matter of notation, I use i , t interchangeably when no confusion is possible. Morphisms of form systems over the same class X as defined in <ref> [2] </ref> are a particular case of the above, with i a = id C A a for each a 2 A and i = , in 6 other words the natural transformation i is identity, i.e. C = C 0 ffi t . <p> The following proposition makes this remark more precise, by pointing out that form systems over classes X and Y can be identified if X and Y are in a 1-1 correspendance. From <ref> [2] </ref>, recall first that U jX, for a given ontology U = (U ; C U ; : U ), is the system (U [X]; C; :), where U [X] is the class of u 2 U such that C U u X. <p> of the above proposition form systems over sets X; Y of the same cardinality may be considered as identical. 2.2 Congruences and Free Form Systems The task in this section is to show that an essentially algebraic treatment of form systems is possible, yielding the form system representation theorem of <ref> [2] </ref> in much the same way as one proves in Universal Algebra that every algebra of a certain similarity type is the quotient of a word algebra of the same type. <p> In what has preceded I have followed the viewpoint that form systems are to be understood as action structures, as pointed out in section 2.1, and have derived the form system representation theorem by proceeding accordingly. In an appendix to <ref> [2] </ref>, it is observed that ontologies can be viewed as T -algebras, for a many-sorted algebraic theory T . <p> With this observation, Aczel (in the mentioned appendix of <ref> [2] </ref>) embarks in an essentially algebraic rephrasing of form systems, which, however, remains incomplete. <p> Extending Aczel's notion of a form system, we regard the subcategories of X-form systems as pre-form systems (over X). 6 No such connection is being sketched in <ref> [2] </ref>, however, and the appendix proposing that ontologies can be regarded as many sorted algebras stands in rather loose connection with the main body of the paper. 14 Definition 2.19 A pre-form system over X is a structure A = (A; C; Sub; :), where A, X are classes, Sub is <p> Then A is isomorphic to a subsystem of (U jX) = ^ . By proposition 2.22 the latter is the same system as U ; jX, for a unique congruence extending ^ . 2 2.4.2 Substitution and Replacement The kinds of structures whose study was initiated in <ref> [2] </ref> are focused on a notion of replacement of components, rather than one of substitution of parameters occurring in an object. In contrast, the approach taken by e.g. <p> The representation result means that (A; C; :) U jA, hence there is a bijection (the isomorphism, as a map on objects) ff : U [A] A. Aczel <ref> [2] </ref> proves a characterization result of well-founded and anti-founded elementary universes in terms of initial and final objects in the category of full algebras for the ontology U , where a full algebra is a pair (B; fi) and fi is a bijection fi : U [B] B. <p> I review this result here, 8 pointing out how the categorical notion of a final object relates to the anti-foundation axiom. The duality theorem in Aczel <ref> [2] </ref> (rather, its part relating final objects and anti-founded universes) follows immediately as soon as the anti-foundation axiom (AF A) is rephrased appropriately in a categorical context. <p> This allows for a rephrasing of anti-foundation in terms of what the authors call the substitution lemma. By just a small change in perspective, this allows for a reformulation of AFA that seems to be useful, inasmuch as it at least makes the proof of the Duality theorem in <ref> [2] </ref> rather straightforward. We recall first this theorem. Theorem 3.2 (Aczel) Let (A; ff) be a full algebra for an A-bounded ontology U .

Reference-contexts: Existence of wf and af universes follows from results in [1]. A stronger version of the final coalgebra theorem, needed for the existence of af universes, is given in <ref> [3] </ref>. The representation theorem shows that ontologies are the generic structures of the theory, in the sense that every form system can be obtained in a certain way from a uniquely specified ontology.

As a solution to a parametrization problem raised by Dag Westerstahl in [8], the elementary theory has been enriched by Lunnon, in [7], with a construction of the injective sum of elementary universes. <p> Note, however, that the above characterization result does not in any way imply existence of af-universes. Aczel's Initial Algebra and Final Coalgebra theorems ([1] and, with Mendler, <ref> [3] </ref>) provide conditions under which the final and initial objects in question exist.

Reference-contexts: The theory can be divided in basically two parts, the elementary theory and the -theory. The -theory, initiated by Aczel and Lunnon in <ref> [4] </ref> and still in need of development, introduces an abstraction operation in the universe, enriching it with -abstracts. I will be concerned in this paper only with the elementary theory. <p> ON is the category V-FS of ontologies. X-FS*, EU* and ON* are the full subcategories of FS (removing the restriction for standard morphisms). If preservation of components for elementary universe morphisms is understood as the requirement that C B (a) = (C A a), as proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>, then insisting also on full preservation of replacement (which is exactly the case in the category EU) forces morphisms to be in practically all cases injective. To be more precise, the following is immediate. <p> To be more precise, the following is immediate. Lemma 2.2 If : A ! B is an EU-morphism and A has at least one object with at least two components, then is either constant or injective. 2 The solution suggested in <ref> [4] </ref> and [7] is to keep with preservation of components in the above sense but relax the requirement that the operation of replacement be fully preserved. <p> It can only be pointed out here that the generalization to preform systems proposed in this paper, together with the notion of a parametric universe with a substitution operation in <ref> [4] </ref>, should lead to a clarification of the relations between the two approaches and to an integrated study of substitution and replacement. <p> the quotient ontology U ; . 8 There is a similar, but open, problem with a possible characterization of wf and af -universes in terms of initial and final objects in an appropriate category 9 For the af universes I quote the definition eventually adopted by Aczel and Lunnon in <ref> [4] </ref>. * Let A = (A; C; :) be a universe.

Reference-contexts: The component-of relation, generalizing the membership relation, need not be well-founded, in fact applications of situation theory, as in Barwise and Etchemendy <ref> [6] </ref>, would require an anti-founded relation, allowing for objects that are components of themselves. <p> A is anti-founded if every U -system of equations has a unique solution in A, where U is a representative ontology of A. 3.2 Final Objects and Anti-Foundation 3.2.1 A Categorical Version of AF A In <ref> [6] </ref>, Barwise and Etchemendy use a variant of AFA working in a universe that allows for urelements (or atoms), thought of as indeterminates, or parameters. The sets in such a universe are not only the pure ones, but also those that may include atoms in their build-up.

Further development has been carried out by Lunnon <ref> [7] </ref>. The project has been in fact set to motion by an unpublished paper ([5]) of Jon Barwise, proposing a formal sketch of a model for situation theory. <p> These two results, together with the initial algebra and final coalgebra theorems of [1] (and [3], for the second), form the basic core of the elementary theory. As a solution to a parametrization problem raised by Dag Westerstahl in [8], the elementary theory has been enriched by Lunnon, in <ref> [7] </ref>, with a construction of the injective sum of elementary universes. With this result, the development of the elementary theory of form systems was essentially completed, some observations on many sorted universes put forth in Lunnon [7] being, by comparison, of secondary importance. 1.2 Summary of Results A mild generalization of <p> by Dag Westerstahl in [8], the elementary theory has been enriched by Lunnon, in <ref> [7] </ref>, with a construction of the injective sum of elementary universes. With this result, the development of the elementary theory of form systems was essentially completed, some observations on many sorted universes put forth in Lunnon [7] being, by comparison, of secondary importance. 1.2 Summary of Results A mild generalization of Aczel's notion of a form system is suggested (extending to what may be called a pre-form system) by essentially considering as objects of the theory the subcategories of form systems. (Pre)Form systems are collected to a <p> It is easy to see that coproducts exist in each category of X-form systems. It did not seem possible to produce a general construction of a categorical sum of form systems over distinct classes X and Y . In the particular case of elementary universes, Lunnon <ref> [7] </ref> provided a construction of what is there called the injective sum of universes. <p> To be more precise, the following is immediate. Lemma 2.2 If : A ! B is an EU-morphism and A has at least one object with at least two components, then is either constant or injective. 2 The solution suggested in [4] and <ref> [7] </ref> is to keep with preservation of components in the above sense but relax the requirement that the operation of replacement be fully preserved. <p> of (unique up to isomorphism) wf and af U -universes folows. 3.3 Parametric Universes 3.3.1 The Injective Sum The problem of parametrizing the objects of a given elementary universe by items of a given class of parameters, generalized to that of somehow "adding" two universes together, was treated in Lunnon <ref> [7] </ref>. The injective sum construction of Lunnon uses a notion of an elementary universe morphism that allows for the possibility that the replacement operation is not fully preserved. By an injective sum is meant, in [7], a universe A = A 1 + A 2 such that there are injective universe <p> of parameters, generalized to that of somehow "adding" two universes together, was treated in Lunnon <ref> [7] </ref>. The injective sum construction of Lunnon uses a notion of an elementary universe morphism that allows for the possibility that the replacement operation is not fully preserved. By an injective sum is meant, in [7], a universe A = A 1 + A 2 such that there are injective universe maps i : A i ! A and if there are also injective universe maps t i : A i ! B, then there is a unique universe map (not required to be injective) such <p> In that case, can be defined by (a 0 ) = (a 0 ). In conclusion, is a universe map, according to <ref> [7] </ref>, if it preserves components and if for each replacement map such that is compatible with , we have (:a) = :(a) (2) The morphism : A 1 + A 2 ! B in the injective sum construction is however bound to fail preserving replacement in the full sense, as the <p> Let a = f 2 T be the injection x 2 = x 1 ; y = x 2 . Then :a = f 2 t 1 (:a) = :a. The universe map t is defined in <ref> [7] </ref> by using ( 1 ) t , where this map is defined on fx 1 ; x 2 g by ( 1 ) t (x 1 ) = ( 1 ) t (t 1 x 2 ) = t 1 x 2 = x 2 21 so that t a <p> Given elementary universes A i , i = 1; 2, let U i be their representing ontologies. We may assume that U 1 " U 2 = ; and A 1 " A 2 = ;. Lunnon <ref> [7] </ref> observes that the least fixed point A of the class operator X = i=1;2 is a full algebra 11 for the union ontology U = U 1 [U 2 via the map ff : U [A] A defined by ffu = ff i u if u 2 U i [A <p> Extend t 1 by letting t a = ( 1 ) t : B (t 1 (:a)): (5) As a map on objects, notice that this map t is defined, via ( 1 ) t , as in Lunnon <ref> [7] </ref>. But we can now extend t to a functor by defining its arrow component as follows.
