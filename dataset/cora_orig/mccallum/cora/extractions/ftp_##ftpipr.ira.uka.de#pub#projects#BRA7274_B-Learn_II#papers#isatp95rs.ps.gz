Abstract: A geometric trajectory ensuring the success of an assembly task cannot be determined when the geometric uncertainty is significant. Several solutions like, for instance, passive compliance devices have been applied in order to decrease the influence of geometric uncertainty. Nevertheless, the general solution appears to be the use of active compliance which implies reaction force/torque feedback, but this use gives rise to some particular problems in the task planning and execution. Sensorial configuration and force information becomes a key point in this field. This paper describes how this sensor information can be used in an assembly fine-motion planner and also during the task execution. The basic concepts have already been implemented and the peg-into-hole assembly task serves as an example to illustrate the results.

Reference-contexts: Within this frame, this work deals with the use of configuration and reaction force/torque information in assembly task planning and execution. The paper is organized as follows. After this introduction, section 2 briefly describes a fine-motion planner previously proposed by the authors <ref> [14] </ref>. Sections 3 and 4 are centered respectively on the off-line (prediction) and on-line (estimation) use of configuration and reaction force/torque information. Section 5 illustrates the theoretical developments by means of a 3 d.o.f. peg-into-hole example. <p> In the authors' approach a task state E is characterized by a set of compatible basic contacts <ref> [14] </ref>, [2], [15]. The states constitute the nodes of a graph G-Nom whose arcs link contiguous states. Each state E has a realization R, the set of configurations in which E takes place for some given parameter deviations.

Basically, the operators allowing to leave or to reach a given state are determined by analyzing the directions in C crossing a given portion of the corresponding DCr frontier <ref> [15] </ref>. The domains DC are used on-line to determine which states are compatible with the current sensed configuration. This is done by selecting the states whose domains DC contain the sensed configuration. <p> The results of these works are applied below to the example in section 5. Some heuristics to estimate the current contact state in the case of ambiguity for the planner described in section 2 has been proposed in <ref> [15] </ref>. 5 An example The concepts presented in previous sections are illustrated here using a planar peg-into-hole assembly task (figure 3). The widths of the peg and the hole are 80 mm and 100 mm respectively.
