Reference-contexts: In the Lemma below an integrality argument is used. First we need some preparation. 9 The following result may be well-known. The proof is almost identical to the proofs for the binary case in <ref> [2] </ref>. Proposition 4.5 Let qjn. Any q-ary 1-error-correcting code of length n has size at most q n =(n (q 1) + q), and the inner distribution of any code meeting this bound is uniquely determined. <p> If equality holds, then (aQ) j = 0 for j 6= 0; (q 1)n=q 1; (q 1)n=q, and hence, by <ref> [2, Corollary 3.1] </ref>, the inner distribution a is uniquely determined. 2 Lemma 4.6 N (0; 13; 4) &lt; 3 9 . <p> Proof: We prove more generally that no ternary code with the parameters of a singly shortened Hamming code of word length n, where n = 2 mod 5, is the truncation of a distance-4 ternary code. By the above proposition, and <ref> [2, Theorem 4.2.5] </ref>, it follows that the inner distribution of any (0; 13; 4) M code with M = 3 9 is uniquely determined. Doing the computation, we find A 5 = n (n 1)(n 4)(n 5)=30. <p> Indeed, we construct ([8; 7; 2]=[8; 4; 4])j (D= D ) where D = fD 0 + u j u 2 U g for some (0; 6; 4) 18 3 See [1], [28, p. 57], [7, p. 140]. code D 0 contained in the zero-sum <ref> [6; 5; 2] </ref> 3 ternary code E, where U is a set of at least eight vectors in E with pairwise distance at most 3. In fact it is easy to find a U of size 11: take f0g [ f (e 1 e j ) j 2 j 6g. <p> For further examples, see also Section 5.2 below. If C is the partition into singletons, we write C instead of C= C .

Reference-contexts: Note that the former ingredient exists: we can construct (4; 1; 3) 6 as ([4; 3; 2]=<ref> [4; 1; 4] </ref>)j (0; 1; 1) 3 , and then use translates by the eight coset leaders of [4; 1; 4]. 2 We have not found a partition of the (0; 6; 2) 243 zero-sum code into eight distance-3 codes, but can come close. <p> That N (3; 4; 3) 42 was shown earlier by Karl-Goran Valivaara. A similar construction can be used starting from the <ref> [16; 11; 4] </ref> extended binary Hamming code H. Let u be a codeword of weight 4, and replace the four binary coordinate positions in its support by two ternary positions, replacing 1000, 0100, 0010, 1001, 0101, 0011 by 00, 11, 22, 01, 12, 20, respectively. <p> Fix a codeword a of weight 8 in H ? , and let A be its support.

Reference-contexts: (X 0 ; R 0 ) and (X 00 ; R 00 ) be two association schemes, with R 0 = fR i 0 j i 0 2 I 0 g and R 00 = fR i 00 j i 00 2 I 00 g. (For definitions and notation, see <ref> [5, Chapter 2] </ref>.) We get a new association scheme (X; R), the product of these two, by taking X = X 0 fi X 00 for the point set, and R = fR i 0 i 00 j i 0 2 I 0 ; i 00 2 I 00 g, where, <p> Indeed, we construct ([8; 7; 2]=[8; 4; 4])j (D= D ) where D = fD 0 + u j u 2 U g for some (0; 6; 4) 18 3 See [1], [28, p. 57], [7, p. 140]. code D 0 contained in the zero-sum <ref> [6; 5; 2] </ref> 3 ternary code E, where U is a set of at least eight vectors in E with pairwise distance at most 3.

Reference-contexts: In searching for codes using this approach, the following idea from <ref> [30] </ref> was used. First, we construct a family of inequivalent matrices A and B with given parameters. Then the computer search is carried out separately for all possible combinations of these matrices.

Reference-contexts: The dual version of this problem, the existence of small coverings in X, has been discussed in <ref> [15, 32] </ref>. Both of these problems were originally motivated by the football pool problem (see [14]). We begin by describing the use of product schemes to get upper bounds on N (n 2 ; n 3 ; d), and then discuss various constructions and computer searches that provide lower bounds. <p> Moves in the tabu list are not allowed within a given number L of steps. Almost the same methods and programs were used earlier for finding covering codes <ref> [31, 32] </ref>. 6.1 Searching for codes with a given structure Searching for codes by these methods becomes ineffective if the codes are too large (for d = 3, when there are more than about 100 codewords, for example). <p> This method was originally developed for covering codes. An analogous method that works for error-correcting codes was presented in [33]. Let us formulate it here for the case of mixed binary/ternary error-correcting codes. (See also <ref> [8, 32] </ref>, where the method is applied to mixed binary/ternary covering codes.) Let A be an n 2 fi m 2 binary matrix of rank n 2 and let B be an n 3 fi m 3 ternary matrix of rank n 3 .

Reference-contexts: A method used by Kamps and Van Lint [20] and Blokhuis and Lam [4] leads to codes that are unions of cosets of linear codes. This method was originally developed for covering codes. An analogous method that works for error-correcting codes was presented in <ref> [33] </ref>. <p> In <ref> [33] </ref> it was shown that A 3 (16; 3) 1062882 (using a variation on Propo sition 5.8).

However, this set does have the structure of a product scheme, and so a version of the linear programming bound can be 2 obtained for both designs (cf. <ref> [36] </ref>) and codes. The linear programming bound for codes in an arbitrary association scheme can be briefly described as follows.
