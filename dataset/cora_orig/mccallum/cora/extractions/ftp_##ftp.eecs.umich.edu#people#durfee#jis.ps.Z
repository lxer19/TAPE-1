Reference-contexts: Such assurances are important in many multiagent domains as well. For example, in air-traffic control, fully predicting and resolving interactions (collisions) before taking action is better than "flying by the seat of your pants." However, because plans are generally viewed as programs to be executed <ref> [ Agre and Chapman, 1988 ] </ref> , they can lock agents into a course of action that, as things evolve, is inopportune. Moreover, foreseeing and planning around all possible interactions can be computationally costly and can place great demands on communication in a distributed system.

Reference-contexts: is for the agents to settle questions about what roles should be filled and who should fill them, and Gasser thus views the formation of organizations as based on "the settled and unsettled problems about belief and action through which agents view other agents." Other work on the pursuit problem <ref> [ Benda et al., 1985; Stephens and Merx, 1990 ] </ref> has focussed on alternative organizations among predators for assigning responsibilities among themselves. More complicated task domains require organizations that assign more abstract roles to agents so that they have sufficient flexibility to adapt to changing task demands.

Reference-contexts: AI research in planning for multiple agents can be classified into two main approaches. The first is centralized multiagent planning, in which one of the agents, chosen either by the other agents <ref> [ Cammarata et al., 1983 ] </ref> or by the human designer [ Georgeff, 1983 ] , collects the separate plans of the agents and analyzes them to find potential conflicts. It resolves conflicts by suggesting alterations to plans or by inserting additional synchronization steps.

Reference-contexts: The rich heritage of concepts and ideas from these fields have greatly impacted DAI since its inception. One of my objectives in this paper is briefly to review DAI research that has drawn on diverse social metaphors <ref> [ Chandrasekaran, 1981 ] </ref> to highlight the strong interdisciplinary nature of the field. However, the diverse perspectives of the different social sciences have led to viewing common issues coordination differently.

Reference-contexts: As a consequence, DAI approaches to scheduling generally re-semble constraint satisfaction techniques that have been modified to allow knowledge of and communication about constraints to be distributed. Distributed constraint satisfaction is similarly at the core of the multistage negotiation protocol <ref> [ Conry et al., 1988 ] </ref> . The goal of this protocol is to schedule the allocation of communication network resources so as to establish as many of the desired end-to-end connections as possible. 2.4 Other Metaphors DAI researchers have exploited other social and natural metaphors as well.

Reference-contexts: For example, if the New York and the Boston subsidiaries of Computer Corporation want to avoid competing with each other, they might begin by communicating about their upcoming behaviors at a fairly abstract level to detect potential competition, and then communicate further details only when competition seems likely <ref> [ Durfee and Montgomery, 1990 ] </ref> . Thus, if the Boston subsidiary is increasing demand through rebates, the subsidiaries should further investigate how the combination of sweepstakes and rebates will impact their overlapping sales areas.

Reference-contexts: Hence, within partial global planning, coordination involves both sharing tasks and sharing results, both adhering to long-term organizational roles and reac 6 tively planning to achieve short-term objectives. Partial global planning has been designed to coordinate agents that are cooperatively solving problems <ref> [ Durfee et al., 1989 ] </ref> . During cooperative distributed problem solving, agents solving subproblems of the overall problem must share their results to converge on overall solutions.

I have experimented with networks of 10 sensors and 10 or 11 agents. The details of these experiments are given elsewhere <ref> [ Durfee, 1988 ] </ref> ; here I summarize some of the findings.

Reference-contexts: As AI agents are increasingly introduced into everyday, multiagent settings, the funda 18 mental importance of social knowledge and capabilities become increasingly apparent. For example, research in coordinating AI agents is inextricably tied to research in time-bounded reasoning and acting <ref> [ Durfee, 1990 ] </ref> . Why? Because a large proportion of the "deadlines" imposed on real-time systems, including real-time AI systems, are due to interagent commitments rather than to inherent environmental demands.

Reference-contexts: From an organizational perspective, each AI agent in a group plays a particular organizational role; if these roles are defined and assigned appropriately, the group as a whole can work as a coherent team. 3 A simple example of using an organization can be found in the work of Gasser <ref> [ Gasser et al., 1989 ] </ref> , which considers the "pursuit problem" where four "predators" must pursue and surround a "prey" on a grid. The predators identify four organizational roles, each corresponding to occupying a location (or region) on a different side of the prey.

Reference-contexts: is for the agents to settle questions about what roles should be filled and who should fill them, and Gasser thus views the formation of organizations as based on "the settled and unsettled problems about belief and action through which agents view other agents." Other work on the pursuit problem <ref> [ Benda et al., 1985; Stephens and Merx, 1990 ] </ref> has focussed on alternative organizations among predators for assigning responsibilities among themselves. More complicated task domains require organizations that assign more abstract roles to agents so that they have sufficient flexibility to adapt to changing task demands.

Reference-contexts: Because scheduling often requires coordination of many resources that are physically or functionally distinct, researchers at Carnegie-Mellon have investigated a distributed approach to scheduling <ref> [ Sycara et al., 1990 ] </ref> . The theme underlying this work on scheduling is that constraints on how resources are applied must be generated and propagated to 5 generate suitable schedules.
