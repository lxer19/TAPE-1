Abstract: Measurement-based Admission Control (MBAC) is an attractive mechanism to concurrently oer Quality of Service (QoS) to users, without requiring a-priori trac specitcation and on-line policing. However, several aspects of such a system need to be clearly understood in order to devise robust MBAC schemes. Through a sequence of increasingly sophisticated stochastic models, we study the impact of parameter estimation errors, of ow arrival and departure dynamics, and of estimation memory on the performance of an MBAC system. We show that a certainty equivalence assumption, i.e., assuming that the measured parameters are the real ones, can grossly compromise the target performance of the system. We quantify the improvement in performance as a function of the memory size of the estimator and a more conservative choice of the certainty-equivalent parameters. Our results yield new insights into the performance of MBAC schemes, and represent quantitative guidelines for the design of robust schemes.

Reference-contexts: However, there are also some additional issues that merit attention. First, there is increasing interest in adaptive applications, i.e., applications that are capable of functioning properly even if the QoS falls below the desired level <ref> [4] </ref>. This interest stems from the inability of the current Internet to guarantee any level of QoS.

Reference-contexts: Our work has the further advantage that we use a much simpler service model so that we can focus on the issues associated with the measurement process. Gibbens et al. <ref> [9] </ref> studied memoryless measurement-based admission control in a decision-theoretic framework. Their work takes into account the impact of measurement errors on performance and also considers the call dynamics. However, there are some signitcant dierences between theirs and our work.

Reference-contexts: This simplitcation allows us to focus on the measurement problem that is of central interest in this paper.

Rate changes (renegotiations) are source-initiated and occur only on interval boundaries. We use independent homogeneous sources where the marginal rate distribution is Gaussian with = = 0:3. <p> The statistics of the long-term uctuations of long-range 26 dependence is therefore irrelevant.

Reference-contexts: As a result, trac specitcations can be expected to be quite loose, resulting in conservative use of resources. Stochastic models such as those based on eective bandwidth <ref> [14] </ref> are better suited to achieve good statistical multiplexing gain. However, they suer from two problems. First, it is dicult for the user to come up with the model parameters a priori. If he overestimates his requirements, then resources will be wasted in the network. This reduces the network utilization. <p> The user has to abort the ow or try to adapt to this situation, for example by increasing the degree of compression of a video ow, thereby lowering its perceived quality. Second, it is hard to police trac according to a statistical model <ref> [14] </ref>. It is not clear how to ensure that a trac ow correspond to the specited parameters, without which admission control can easily be fooled. Measurement-based Admission Control (MBAC) avoids these problems by shifting the task of trac specitcation from the user to the network.
