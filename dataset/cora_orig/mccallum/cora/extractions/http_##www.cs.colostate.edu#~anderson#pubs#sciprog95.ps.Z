Abstract: EEG analysis has played a key role in the modeling of the brain's cortical dynamics, but relatively little effort has been devoted to developing EEG as a limited means of communication. If several mental states can be reliably distinguished by recognizing patterns in EEG, then a paralyzed person could communicate to a device like a wheelchair by composing sequences of these mental states. EEG pattern recognition is a difficult problem and hinges on the success of finding representations of the EEG signals in which the patterns can be distinguished. In this article, we report on a study comparing three EEG representations, the unprocessed signals, a reduced-dimensional representation using the Karhunen-Loeve transform, and a frequency-based representation. Classification is performed with a two-layer neural network implemented on a CNAPS server (128 processor, SIMD architecture) by Adaptive Solutions, Inc.. Execution time comparisons show over a hundred-fold speed up over a Sun Sparc 10. The best classification accuracy on untrained samples is 73% using the frequency-based representation.

Reference-contexts: A device that can reliably and quickly discriminate between several mental states could be used, for example, to generate commands to control a wheelchair. Computerized analysis of EEG signals has evolved over the past three decades <ref> [Gev87] </ref>, with much of the effort directed towards a better understanding of the functioning of the brain. The work reported here has a different goal, to extract information from EEG signals with which we can discriminate mental states. Primarily two approaches have been taken towards this goal.

Their selection of the set of mental tasks was guided by Galin and Ornstien <ref> [GO73] </ref> whose results showed detectable hemispheric differences in some tasks. The following tasks were studied in [KA90]: Baseline|Alpha Wave Production The subject is asked to open and close their eyes at approximately five second intervals. With their eyes closed the subject is to relax as much as possible.

Reference-contexts: Other problems are more cognitive in nature. For example, the concentration of a person can vary while the person is supposedly performing a single mental task. The work described in this article is based on previous work by Keirn and Aunon <ref> [KA90, Kei88] </ref>.

An AR model of order 6 (M = 6) was used here since it yielded good results in <ref> [KA90] </ref>. Example patterns in the frequency-based representation are shown in Figure 7.

Reference-contexts: This resulted in 36 asymmetry ratios. In addition the 24 power values themselves (R and L) were added for a total of 60 features. In the current study, the spectral density was estimated from autoregressive (AR) parameters calculated using the Burg method <ref> [PM92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: After each pass through the training data, called an epoch, the weights are adjusted to reduce the error between the correct output and the actual output of the network. To determine how to adjust each weight, we applied the error backpropagation algorithm <ref> [RHW86] </ref>. This algorithm calculates the gradient of an error function with respect to each weight, then adjusts the weights in the negative gradient direction to reduce the error.

Reference-contexts: As the network begins to overfit, the error on the validation set begins to increase. At this point, prior to convergence on the training data, training is halted and the error on the testing set is calculated as a measure of the network's 12 performance. Weigend <ref> [Wei94] </ref> used this technique on a time-series prediction problem and found it to be useful even for very small networks. For the experiments described here, we applied the validation set method for early stopping.

Reference-contexts: One way to limit the growth of complexity during training is to add an error term that biases the gradient search for weight values to regions in weight space of low-magnitude weights. Weigend, Rumelhart, and Huberman <ref> [WRH91] </ref> developed a term that penalizes large magnitude weights and applied this to several time series prediction problems. The third method for controlling overfitting is more dependent on the data than the previous two.
