Abstract: One important question in complexity theory is whether NP is closed under complementation. Translating this problem in terms of propositional logic, we get the following problem: does there exist a proof system in which every tautology has short (polynomial length) proofs? One way to address this problem is to prove (super-polynomial) lower bounds for the size of proofs of tautologies. Although there has been much progress in proving lower bounds for restricted systems, the general unrestricted case seems to be beyond current knowledge. An interesting connection between propositional proof systems and computational complexity theory, is the correspondence of some proof systems with classes of automata. For example, the regular resolution proof system corresponds to read-once branching programs, resolution corresponds to unrestricted branching programs etc. Many interesting problems arise if we try to reverse this correspondence Starting from a class of automata, we can define a corresponding proof system in a natural way. We define a new proof system, based on push-down automata, and prove an exponential lower bound that gives a separation between this model and regular resolution system. The new proof system allows us to move beyond read-once models, and gives rise to many interesting problems. Some known techniques for proving lower bounds in restricted computation models do not seem to apply to the push-down proof system, and it is not clear what is the relative power of this system compared with the standard proof systems we know.
