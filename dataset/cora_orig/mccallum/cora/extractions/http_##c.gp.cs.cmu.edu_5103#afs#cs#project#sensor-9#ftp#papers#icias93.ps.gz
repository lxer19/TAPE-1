Abstract: This paper describes a systematic approach to using robots to automate making difficult measurements in real-world environments. The approach is illustrated by a detailed description of the architecture's actual application to inspection of commercial aircraft for skin cracks and lap joint delamination. Several robot designs are evaluated; a small mobile robot with suction cup feet is found to be best in the practical context of commercial aircraft maintenance and inspection. Approaches are discussed for primary eddy-current flaw detection sensor signal understanding and for secondary vision-based guidance image understanding, The prospects for vision-based inspection are discussed.

Reference-contexts: In later program stages the built-in simple thresholding alarm triggers will be replaced with pattern recognition algorithms or hybrid signature extraction and rule-based decision making systems such as those that have been found useful in automated eddy current inspection of pipe in nuclear power generating facilities <ref> [5] </ref>. We are planning to achieve the required positional accuracy by high precision dead-reckoning over short distances from multiple landmarks: the rivets themselves, each of 1 which is individually identifiable in the aircraft design database.
