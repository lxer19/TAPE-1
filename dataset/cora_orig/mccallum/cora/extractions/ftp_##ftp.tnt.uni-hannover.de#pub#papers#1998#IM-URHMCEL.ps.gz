Abstract: During the last decades image processing systems have been integrated in various automation processes. It has been estimated that only 5% of the automation tasks qualified for image processing systems have so far been realized. This is partly due to the required high engineering effort which is needed to adapt the systems to varying viewing conditions, like changes in illumination, noise artefacts, changes in the surface properties of the observed objects, etc. and to the effort required for the adaptation of the systems to new tasks. This engineering effort could be considerably reduced, if the systems could to some extent adapt themselves automatically. These considerations have led to the development of the knowledge-based system SOLUTION, which is able to adapt low-level image processing algorithms automatically to varying needs. SOLUTION accepts a task description presented in high level terms, configures an appropriate sequence of image processing operators and adapts the free parameter values. SOLUTION therefore uses expert knowledge formulated explicitly by rules. In its present implementation the system is limited to the extraction of contours. The extraction of regions is under development. The results presented here refer to the general task of creating an "op-timal" contour-image that can be further processed by subsequent high-level routines. Examples are taken from applications within the areas of medical and industrial image processing.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the last 10-15 years image processing systems have begun to play an increasing role within many automation processes. These systems are used to monitor or even control the manufacturing process or to inspect the final product for quality assessment (see for example <ref> [1] </ref>). With the growing performance of todays microprocessors the implemented image processing algorithms tend to increase in complexity. They often consist of several simple and well known image processing operators where each of them possesses one or more free parameters.

Reference-contexts: They often consist of several simple and well known image processing operators where each of them possesses one or more free parameters. Examples for such operators can be found in many books, e.g. in <ref> [2] </ref>. The operators included in the processing paths and their parameter values differ usually from one processing task to the other depending on the objects to be examined, the structure of the surrounding scene, the expected result and some other general requirements as for example constraints on the processing time.

Reference-contexts: SOLUTION provides a set of image processing operators and performs a knowledge-driven choice to select the appropriate operators, combines them to processing paths and adapts their parameter values. The structure of SOLUTION is based on the ideas developed for CONNY <ref> [3, 4] </ref> but differs from it in many ways. SOLUTION is much more flexible concerning the task specifications and allows a broader variety of different goals. Another important difference lies within the rules used.

Reference-contexts: The units developed until now are able to learn adaptation rules by goal-directed experimentation and by a special knowledge-based genetic algorithm. These algorithms are described in <ref> [5] </ref> and will not be discussed here further. 3 Sensors The sensors used in SOLUTION are procedures that are able to measure the image properties needed to make decisions about the choice of operators and the adaptation of the parameters.
