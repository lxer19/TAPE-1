Reference-contexts: TACOMA agents and Java applets are complementary. Rather than being downloaded into a browser like applets, TACOMA agents are sent out into the internet to do work on behalf of the user. Java applets can launch TACOMA agents (using a CGI <ref> [CGI96] </ref> front-end to TACOMA), and TACOMA agents can interact with a user through applets. 1 Because any results of an agent's execution can be returned to a user as an applet, there is no reason to support running TACOMA agents in browsersapplets do that job nicely.

Reference-contexts: For example, if the specified agent is a compiler or interpreter, then the code found in the appropriate CODE folder is extracted and executed. Related Work Java <ref> [CW96] </ref> is probably the best known system for launching computations into the Internet. Java programs, called applets, can be downloaded from web servers and executed by Java-able web browsers. Typically, an applet will enhance the graphical user-interface of a web browser for use with some specific application.

Reference-contexts: In fact, TACOMA agents may be written in the Java programming language if so desired. Other related work includes the World Wide Web Consortium's new web server, Jigsaw <ref> [J96] </ref>, which will allow applets to be run on servers, and recent work by General Magic on their Telescript system [T96]. 3. TACOMA Through WWW One way to avoid installing software at a site is to use software that has already been installed there.

Reference-contexts: Agents may be written in Tcl/Tk, C, Scheme, Perl, or Python; support for Java is now being added. Distributed applications have already been implemented using TACOMA to gather and visualize Arctic weather data <ref> [JH95] </ref>, to provide matching between service providers and potential clients, to communicate and interact with users (i.e. active documents), and to manage software installation in a network. TACOMA agents store data in folders.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The TACOMA system <ref> [JRS95] </ref> provides operating-system support for mobile processes, or agents, that traverse the hosts of a network in accomplishing some task. A TACOMA agent executing on one host moves to another host by using TCP to communicate with TACOMA software at the destination host.
