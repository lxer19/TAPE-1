Abstract: CodeTracker is a tool to visualize and profile C programs. It is designed to generate compelling graphs showing the call-chain in moderately complex C programs. These graphs capture information about call-frequency and duration by coloring and sizing nodes according to their cost relative to other procedures. CodeTracker can then animate the call-history of a particular invocation of a program to show the accumulation of execution time for each procedure. Descriptions of code structure and the development process are given, along with a summary of pitfalls and potential future improvements.
