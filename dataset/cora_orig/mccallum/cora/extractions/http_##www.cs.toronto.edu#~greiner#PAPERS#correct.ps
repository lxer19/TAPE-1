Abstract: Reiter [1987] has developed a general theory of diagnosis based on first principles. His algorithm computes all diagnoses which explain the differences between the predicted and observed behavior of a given system. Unfortunately, Re-iter's description of the algorithm is incorrect in that some diagnoses can be missed under certain conditions. This note presents a revised algorithm and a proof of its correctness.

Reference-contexts: Two of the main results of Reiter's work are (1) the following theorem which relates diagnoses, conflict sets, and hitting sets and (2) a method for computing minimal hitting sets. Theorem 1 <ref> [Reiter, 1987; Theorem 4.4] </ref> components is a diagnosis for (sd, components, obs) if and only if is a minimal hitting set for the collection of conflict sets for (sd, components, obs). The minimal hitting sets are computed by constructing a hitting set tree (HS-tree). An HS-tree is defined as follows. <p> This claim is stated, without proof in <ref> [ Reiter, 1987; p. 72 ] </ref> . The claim applies to Reiter's basic algorithm for constructing an HS-tree without pruning. Obviously, if it is true when the members of F are selected arbitrarily, it must be true for any particular ordering, that is, for our related basic hs-dag 0 algorithm.
