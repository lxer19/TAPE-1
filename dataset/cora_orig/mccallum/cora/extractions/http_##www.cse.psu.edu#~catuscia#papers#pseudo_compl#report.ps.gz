Title: Weak Relative Pseudo-Complements of Closure Operators  
Author: Roberto Giacobazzi Catuscia Palamidessi Francesco Ranzato 
Abstract: We define the notion of weak relative pseudo-complement, and we show that, for an arbitrary lattice, the property of weak relative pseudo-complementation is strictly weaker than relative pseudo-complementation, but stronger than pseudo-complementation. Our main interest for this notion is in relation with the theory of closure operators. We prove that if a complete lattice L is completely inf-distributive with respect to chains, then every closure operator on L admits weak relative pseudo-complements with respect to continuous closure operators on L.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Closure operators have been widely used in various fields of theoretical computer science, like semantics of declarative languages and program analysis. In particular, Cousot and Cousot proved in <ref> [2] </ref> that the lattice of abstract interpretations, or equivalently the lattice of semantics derivable by abstraction ([3]), for an arbitrary program whose data-objects have a lattice structure L, is isomorphic to the lattice of the upper closure operators on L, uco (L).
