Title: OSISIM Project The Third Progress Report (January-June 1993)  
Author: Atika COHEN and Radouane MRABET 
Note: 1/ Introduction 2/ The AMS prototype  
Date: September 7, 1993  
Abstract: During the third semester of the OSISIM project, a prototype of the AMS atelier [1, 2, 3] was developed and several demonstrations were made for Professors from ULB 1 and VUB 2 and, for our partner SAIT 3 . Atika COHEN made an oral presentation of the atelier at the COST 228 meeting on July 5th, 1993 at Lisbon, Portugal. Two papers were written, one was already accepted to be presented at the GLOBECOM'93 conference which will be held on November 29th, 1993 at Houston, Texas. The second one was submitted to the Third Maghrebien Conference on Software Engineering and Artificial Intelligence which will be held on April 7th, 1994 at Rabat, Morocco. The AMS prototype contains the major elements the atelier is aimed to perform. An end-user can edit graphically a communication network architecture, choose the values of parameters and the measurements he wants to have at the end of the simulation. After a global check, he can easly ask for the generation of the QNAP2 code modeling his edited communication system. 1 Mr Oscar Beaufays and Mr Paul Van Binst 2 Mme RosetteVandenbroucke and Mr Jacques Thibergien 3 Mr Joseph Collard and Mr Jean-Franois Hellings
