Reference-contexts: All of these things could help to improve the state of the engineering practice. But without applying accurate mathematical models of physical phenomena to preview product designs, the current, advanced level of aerospace engineering practice would not be possible. In his introductory textbook on flight <ref> [Anderson 89] </ref>, John D. Anderson, Jr. begins his chapter on basic aerodynamics with the following two quotations: Mathematics up to the present day have been quite useless to us in regard to flying. -- From the fourteenth Annual Report of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain, 1879.

Reference-contexts: Some specific examples of different models of program behavior and mathematical proofs that one logically follows from another can be found in <ref> [Bevier 89a] </ref>, [Hunt 89], [Moore 89] and [Young 89]. These examples involve three languages: Gypsy, the assembly language Piton, and FM8502 machine language. The FM8502 is a 32-bit micro-processor of complexity comparable to a PDP-11. Gypsy is compiled into Piton, and Piton is compiled into FM8502 machine language.

Reference-contexts: The Gypsy model is just as accurate as the FM8502 gate-level model! Another important example of deducing that one model logically follows from another is described in <ref> [Bevier 89b] </ref>. Here it is proved that a model of a simple separation kernel, Kit, logically follows by applying the machine language model of an FM8502-like processor to a particular machine language program description.

Reference-contexts: Mechanical theorem provers are one way of dealing with this volume. For example, to obtain maximal assurance that the mathematical deductions cited above in [Hunt 89], <ref> [Bevier 89c] </ref>, [Moore 89] and [Young 89] were done without logical errors, all of them have been confirmed with a mechanical theorem prover.
