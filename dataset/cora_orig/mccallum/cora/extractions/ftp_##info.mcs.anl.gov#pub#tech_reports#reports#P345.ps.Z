Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Fortran M is a small set of extensions to Fortran 77 that supports a modular or object-oriented approach to the development of parallel programs <ref> (Foster and Chandy, 1992) </ref>. In this paper, I discuss the use of Fortran M as a tool for building earth system models on massively parallel computers. I hypothesize that the use of Fortran M has software engineering advantages and outline experiments that we are conducting to investigate this hypothesis. 2.
