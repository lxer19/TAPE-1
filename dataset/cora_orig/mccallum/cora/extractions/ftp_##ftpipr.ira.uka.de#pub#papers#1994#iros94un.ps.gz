Abstract: Increasing the flexibility of robot systems has been one of the main objectives of robotics research in recent years. There are various approaches to achieve this: increasing fault-tolerance on different levels, the development of sophisticated sensors, grippers and manipulators and the use of learning techniques. But the field of operation of such smart systems is still limited to a rather small area. Mobile manipulation is another facet of increasing the flexibility of a robot system. By exploiting the mobility of a platform, the dextrous workspace of manipulators can be considerably increased. One main research topic on mobile manipulation is the decomposition of the motion of the tool-center-point (TCP) into manipulator motion and platform motion. In this paper a new online approach to this decomposition is presented which allows the consideration of complex obstacles and multiple manipulators mounted on the platform. Simulation studies verify the suitability of the approach. Some of the realized algorithms have been applied to a real mobile two-arm system [18].

Reference-contexts: . (2) A widespread approach for decomposing the end-effector motion is to use a pseudo-inverse of the Jacobian of the whole mobile manipulator: q = q p + x + (I - J J)k , (3) where J + T T -1 is the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of the Jacobian <ref> [1] </ref> and J is the mobile manipulator Jacobian from Eqn. (2). The last term in Eqn.3 is related to the internal motion of the system, which has no effect on the position or orientation of the end-effector.

Reference-contexts: Researchers investigating control systems with redundant kinematics mainly consider manipulators with more than six degrees of freedom (DoF)[1],[2]. On the other hand, there are path planning approaches for mobile manipulators where the manipulators are considered fixed during the motion <ref> [3] </ref>. The following articles consider manipulators and a mobile platform as an integrated system: in [4] a method is introduced that allows a mobile manipulator system to exert a definite force on a moving object, e.g., to transport it in cooperation with other robots.

Reference-contexts: The goal is to get the manipulator in such a configuration that a subsequent assembly task can be performed without delay. The inertial properties of holonomic mobile manipulation systems and strategies for their coordination and control are the focus of <ref> [8] </ref>. Based on the operational space formulation a model for the robot dynamics is being developed. The mobile base is viewed as a "macro-mechanism" whereas the arm is a fast and accurate "mini"-device.

Reference-contexts: The key idea is the notion of kinematic consistency that allows the generation of control torques, that do not change the dynamic properties of the mini device.

The dynamic properties of the manipulator as well as the dynamic properties of the mobile platform are taken into account. The experimental results that could be obtained with this control scheme are presented in [10]. A similar problem is investigated in [11].

Reference-contexts: By means of a cost func tional one of the variety of solutions resulting from the redundancy is chosen. A similar problem is dealt with in <ref> [13] </ref>. For two successive manipulation tasks, a configuration of the mobile base and manipulator has to be determined that complies with the requirements of both tasks and allows an optimal transition. The question of connecting these configurations by a trajectory has not yet been considered. <p> In the following, these extensions are discussed in detail. 2.1 Motion decomposition In contrast to many researchers who perform offline decomposition of the TCP motion to obtain globally optimized trajectories [12][14], in this approach a global optimization is merely established for the goal configu ration <ref> [13] </ref>, while the motion is decomposed online. The loss of optimality during motion is more than compensated by the gain in flexibility. This flexibility allows dynamic obstacles to be considered and multiple manipulators can be supported.

Reference-contexts: The question of connecting these configurations by a trajectory has not yet been considered. The design of a control system for a mobile manipulator is the main subject of <ref> [14] </ref>, where all actuators are controlled in one loop. For a given trajectory, a performance functional, including several optimality criterions, is minimized offline. The resulting trajectory in augmented coordinates is used to generate motion commands for the mobile platform and the manipulator system.

Reference-contexts: Usually, configuration space models are introduced to enable the collision-free navigation of mobile robots or for coarse motion planning for manipulators. The robot's geometry is reduced to a point while the obstacles a re enlarged to consider the robot's geometry <ref> [19] </ref>. Only the geometric information of objects in the environment is considered in this case. Motion planning for mobile manipulation needs to regard the workspace and the current configuration of the manipulators as well.

Reference-contexts: The workspace of one of the manipulators is exemplarily transformed into a virtual obstacle (MCO) that is extended to infinity. transformation GCO transformation platform configuration configuration space MCO MCO platform configuration The obstacles are represented in an approximate cell decomposition <ref> [20] </ref> with a regular grid in a three-dimensional cube, in accordance with the three degrees of freedom of the platform. In order to avoid manipulator collisions resulting from the platform motion, their geometry must be considered when computing the configuration space obstacles. <p> Within the workspace of the manipulators, they are able to move independent of the mobile platform. The problem of motion planning for mobile manipulation can therefore be considered as a special case of motion planning for moving obstacles. The approaches to that problem in <ref> [20] </ref> assume a priori knowledge of the obstacle trajectory, which is not given for the case considered here (the trajectory of the manipulators is generally not known to the platform). Therefore the manipulator motion has to be continually monitored and the platform has to react appropriately.

Reference-contexts: For the global planning scheme, only the GCOs are considered for motion planning, since the manipulator is passive. The motion is planned using a standard algorithm, like the Lee-Moore algorithm <ref> [21] </ref> or the algorithm from [22] that uses a diffusion process. Prior to applying these algorithms it is necessary to compute a goal configuration for the mobile platform.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, fast planning cycles can be expected. The local planning scheme for position-controlled manipulation tasks utilizes a combination of the distance potential field (DPF) from the Lee-Moore algorithm and of the valuation potential fields (VPF) for the manipulator, where the cost-function is taskspecific <ref> [23] </ref>. The VPF is evaluated at a finer resolution than the DPF to allow for the exact monitoring and reaction to the manipulator configuration.

Reference-contexts: Possible approaches are to derive a position by following the gradient vector with a definite step width, which is usually denoted 'hill climbing' <ref> [24] </ref>, or to derive a velocity vector that is given by the gradient vector. Since the second approach results in much smoother motions and allows vehicle dynamics to be considered, it is adopted for our application.
