Abstract: Networking protocols are being modified to handle mobility of hosts. This paper argues that there is a need to make mobility explicit at every level of the OSI model | even above the network level through user or application level. Further, it is proposed that the mobile host and the first hop (wireless link) of communication be handled differently than the rest of the network. Hence, in networks with mobile hosts, we propose a radical approach of indirect interaction between clients and servers.

Reference-contexts: The indirect model also allows the fixed hosts (MSSs) to maintain a large part of protocol related state on behalf of the mobile hosts. This model is thus consistent with the approach of pushing as much computation as possible to the fixed network <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. The remainder of this section describes how the indirect model can be used to support the needs of mobile client applications. 2.1 Transport Layer In the ISO/OSI model, the transport layer provides end to end bi-directional communication.

Reference-contexts: A more general requirement of broadcast based communication sessions is subject-based naming as described by Cheriton <ref> [5] </ref> which allows binding to a flow of information rather than to a particular server.

Reference-contexts: Initial work on supporting mobility in the internet has resulted in a number of proposals to support communication from/to moving hosts by modifying protocols at the network layer <ref> [8, 18, 15] </ref>.

An indirect version of a transport protocol allows separate flow control for the wired and the wireless parts of a connection.

Reference-contexts: Further, a transport level connection that provides end to end flow control will continue to do so irrespective of whether the end points of the link are mobile. When one of the links is a slow wireless link, the end-to-end performance will degrade to that of the wireless link <ref> [9, 14] </ref>. With, end to end flow control, the full round trip delay will increase due to the slow wireless link, and hence affects the response time of all packets.

Reference-contexts: Recently, mechanisms for handoff for special purpose network level, connection-oriented protocols have been studied <ref> [12] </ref>. Also related are the issues of how the indirect interaction is viewed by a fixed host and by a mobile host and what addressing scheme each one uses.

Reference-contexts: This model however, places additional burden on the MSSs, of managing higher layer protocol states on behalf of the MHs. We can also expect 6 that servers on fixed hosts will become aware of mobility, i.e., when new mobility-aware servers are implemented on fixed hosts <ref> [16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Further, for mobile hosts, the primary connection to the rest of the network is a wireless link. The wireless link has different characteristics than the links that comprise the fixed network. Wireless links are unreliable (optimal packet lengths have to be small <ref> [17] </ref>), have bandwidth constraints (maximum available, 2Mbps), and are relatively unsecure. Initial work on supporting mobility in the internet has resulted in a number of proposals to support communication from/to moving hosts by modifying protocols at the network layer [8, 18, 15].
