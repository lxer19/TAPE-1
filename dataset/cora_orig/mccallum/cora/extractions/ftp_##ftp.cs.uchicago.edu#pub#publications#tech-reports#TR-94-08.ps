Abstract: Two results on the Bit Extraction Problem Abstract We study the problem of coloring the n-dimensional boolean cube with c = 2 s colors such that in every k-dimensional subcube each color appears 2 k =c times. We are interested in the smallest k for which such a coloring exists. This problem is equivalent to the t-resilient function problem. A coloring is locally symmetric if each vertex in the n-cube has the same number of neighbors from each color other than its own. An XOR-type coloring is one obtained by a linear map GF (2) n ! GF (2) s . Our main results answer the following problems proposed by Friedman [4]: 1) if c 1jn, are all optimal colorings necessarily locally symmetric? 2) are there optimal colorings not obtainable as XOR type colorings? We give positive answers to both questions. Along the way we prove some identities involving the distance distribution of color classes, in order to gain a better understanding of the structure of color classes. Our main tool is an expression of the eigenvalues of the distance-i adjacency matrix of the n-cube via the Krawtchouk polynomials.

Reference-contexts: follows that any polynomial P (x) of degree ` n can be represented as P (x) = P ` which is called the Krawtchouk expansion of P (x). 3 Preliminaries We start with an expression of the eigenvalues of the distance-i adjacency matrix of n-cube through the Krawtchouk polynomials (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>, Chap. 3.2). In section 4, we use this relation 4 to prove that for c 1jn the optimal (c; n; k) must be locally symmetric.

Reference-contexts: We use H k to indicate the set of all k-dimensional sub-cubes. The coloring problem is to color B n with c = 2 s colors such that every color appears in every k-dimensional sub-cube exactly 2 k =c times. Following Friedman <ref> [4] </ref> we call such a coloring a (c; n; k)-coloring. Note that the number of colors used in the coloring can be as large as 2 n . k log c is a trivial lower bound for k. <p> A (c; n; k)-coloring is optimal if the k is the smallest one for given c and n.

Our main results are the following. 2 Theorem 1 If c 1jn, then all optimal (c; n; k)-coloring must be locally symmetric. <p> Theorem 2 For c 1jn 1,c 4 , there exist optimal colorings for B n which are neither locally symmetric nor XOR type coloring. The main technique used in this paper, as in <ref> [4] </ref> is the spectral method. We simplify some of the proofs of [4] by using the relation of the Krawtchouk polynomials, a class of orthogonal polynomials, to the eigenvalues of the distance-i adjacency matrix of B n . We also study the distance distribution of the color classes. <p> Theorem 2 For c 1jn 1,c 4 , there exist optimal colorings for B n which are neither locally symmetric nor XOR type coloring.

We simplify some of the proofs of [4] by using the relation of the Krawtchouk polynomials, a class of orthogonal polynomials, to the eigenvalues of the distance-i adjacency matrix of B n . We also study the distance distribution of the color classes. <p> In Section 2 we give some basic definitions and review known facts. In Section 3 we present the connection between Krawtchouk polynomials and the eigenvalues of distance-i adjacency matrix, and some related results. In Section 4 we prove the main results which answer the open questions in <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> Let C B n be a 1=c dense subset in H k .

This completes the proof. 2 This identity helps to simplify some of the proofs in <ref> [4] </ref> and obtain a better understanding of the 1=c dense sets. More importantly, for c 1jn, we can precisely calculate the distance distribution. Proposition 8 Given a subset of B n 1=c dense in H k , let fN i g be its distance distribution. <p> Proposition 9 For any two disjoint 1=c dense sets in H k , say C 1 ; C 2 , we have j X n j N i (C 1 ; C 2 ) = c 2 n ! We shall use the following results of <ref> [4] </ref>. We mention that these results also follow from our machinery. Let S j (x) = 2 j nx j . As in the proof of Proposition 8 we have B n;j = P j ni and &lt; C B n;j ; C &gt;= i=0 ji N i . <p> As in the proof of Proposition 8 we have B n;j = P j ni and &lt; C B n;j ; C &gt;= i=0 ji N i . For c 1jn, we always let k = 1 + (c2)n 2 (c1) unless stated otherwise. Lemma 10 <ref> [4] </ref> Let C B n be an arbitrary subset of size 2 n =c. 1. For c 1jn and j &lt; k, we have &lt; C B n;j ; C &gt; = c 2 S j (0) + c 2 S j (n k + 1): 2. <p> Theorem 11 <ref> [4] </ref> Let c 1jn and C be a set 1=c dense in H k . Then C ? v T , for non-empty T [n] with jT j 6= n k + 1. Proof. Take j = k 1 in Lemma 10.1. <p> have N i = &lt; A n;i ; &gt; X a 2 T P i (jT j) &lt; v T ; v T &gt;; by Theorem 6 = c 2 (P i (0) + (c 1)P i (n k + 1)); by Theorem 11: 2 4 Main results As in <ref> [4] </ref>, an locally symmetric coloring is defined as a coloring fl : B n ! B s , such that for all v 2 B n exactly n of v's neighbors are colored fl (v), and every other color occurs among v's neighbors exactly n (1 )=(c 1) times. <p> It is clear that to have locally symmetric coloring, c must be at most n + 1. By adapting the technique of <ref> [4] </ref>, we prove a lower bound for k. Proposition 13 For any locally symmetric -(c; n; k) coloring, k 1 + n 2 + (c1)n Proof. As usual, let be the characteristic vector of vertices of an arbitrary color. Let = T [n] a T v T . <p> Now consider &lt; A n;1 ; &gt;. It is clear that n2 n =c =&lt; A n;1 ; &gt; : By some simple calculation, we have k 1 + n 2 + (c1)n The case = 0 of this result appears in <ref> [4] </ref>. A locally symmetric coloring is called sparse if = 0. In the case of c 1jn, all optimal locally symmetric colorings are sparse [4].

Theorem 14 If c 1jn, then all optimal (c; n; k)-coloring must be locally symmetric. (Remark: Sparsity was shown in [4]. Our result is the local symmetry; our proof also yields an alternative proof of sparsity.) Proof. <p> In the case of c 1jn, all optimal locally symmetric colorings are sparse <ref> [4] </ref>. The following result gives a positive answer to a problem proposed in [4]. Theorem 14 If c 1jn, then all optimal (c; n; k)-coloring must be locally symmetric. (Remark: Sparsity was shown in [4]. Our result is the local symmetry; our proof also yields an alternative proof of sparsity.) Proof. Let C be a color class and let = P T [n] a T v T be its characteristic vector. <p> A useful observation about XOR-colorings in <ref> [4] </ref> is that considering any cycle of length 4, (p 0 ; p 1 ; p 2 ; p 3 ; p 0 ), in B n then XOR-colorings satisfy the following two conditions: 1. fl (p 3 ) depends only on fl (p 0 ); fl (p 1 ); fl <p> We use these properties to prove that there are optimal colorings which are not XOR type coloring. This was raised as an open question in <ref> [4] </ref>. Theorem 15 For c1jn1, but c 4 , there exist optimal colorings for B n which are neither locally symmetric nor XOR coloring. Proof. First consider an optimal coloring fl : B n1 ! f1; :::; cg with c colors. <p> While there are still some unanswered questions related to the bit extraction problem. We shall list some problems which we consider to be interesting. 1. Given c and n, can we improve the lower bound for the smallest k? Note that the lower bound proved in <ref> [4] </ref> is good for small c and the bound is at most n=2 + 1. 2. Is there any other general systematic coloring method? Note that at this point the XOR-coloring method is the only known systematic coloring method.
