Abstract: We examine the applicability of existing IP multicast mechanisms for Point-to-Point links such as wired and wireless telephone lines. We identify problems such as overhead due to IGMP leave latency and unnecessary probing of hosts, both important issues for power constrained mobile hosts and low bandwidth wireless links. We propose alternative mechanisms that preserve the IP multicasting model but employ join/leave messages to track group membership. We describe the implementation requirements of our mechanisms and compare them to existing ones with respect to performance, mobile power efficiency, interoperability, robustness and implementation complexity, demonstrating that the join/leave approach is uniformly superior for this environment.

Reference-contexts: Using this state, shortest path multicast distribution trees from each source to all destination networks can be computed on demand using Dijkstra's algorithm. 3 A radically different approach to multicast routing is the Core Based Trees <ref> [1] </ref> (CBT) protocol, which employs a single tree for each group, shared among all sources. The tree is rooted at an arbitrarily chosen multicast router (the core) and extends towards all LANs containing group members. It is explicitly constructed from leaf network routers towards the core as group members appear.

Reference-contexts: The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) provides a mechanism for local group management targeted to broadcast LANs, i.e. only group presence or absence is tracked. In IGMP v.1 <ref> [2] </ref> the multicast router periodically sends a local query message to a multicast group to which all local multicast receivers listen.

Reference-contexts: Routing is thus a two stage process, and usually sub-optimal as the first stage may propagate datagrams away from their destinations. Traffic with CBT tends to concentrate on the single tree rather than being spread throughout the network. Since no routing mechanism is perfect, the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) <ref> [3] </ref> protocol, employs either shared or per source trees, depending on application requirements. Note that all global schemes route multicasts between networks rather than hosts, so as to keep routing calculations and tables within reasonable limits. Multicasting within each LAN is a task for the local mechanisms. <p> Note that all global schemes route multicasts between networks rather than hosts, so as to keep routing calculations and tables within reasonable limits. Multicasting within each LAN is a task for the local mechanisms. Protocols that construct per source trees, (DVMRP, MOSPF and PIM in dense mode <ref> [3] </ref>), also deal with source networks. Each Autonomous System (AS) on the Internet, may employ its own multicast routing scheme, necessitating the use of an inter-area routing protocol [11]. In addition, networks supporting IP multicast may only be connected via multicast unaware routers. <p> MOSPF would face routing table explosion since each router would have to keep track of every end host's group membership. Only protocols employing shared trees (such as CBT or PIM in sparse mode <ref> [3] </ref>) could work with this approach, since they only employ local information for routing and they never use broadcasts. Regardless of routing protocol however, extending global mechanisms to local PtP links violates the IP distinction between internetworking and local networking.

Reference-contexts: Based on this common interface, alternative mechanisms can be used for wide area multicast routing, without affecting local mechanisms, and vice versa. 2.2 Global IP Multicast Mechanisms The original global multicast mechanism used on the MBone was the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP). DVMRP v.1 <ref> [4] </ref> is a variation of Truncated Reverse Path Broadcast [5]. Each router uses a separate distribution tree for each source sending to a group, so that datagrams from the source (root) are duplicated only when paths towards destination networks (leaves) diverge.

Reference-contexts: We present our conclusions in Section 6. 2 IP Multicast and Point-to-Point Local Distribution 2.1 IP Multicast Model The IP multicast model is based on the host group, an arbitrary set of hosts identified by a single, class D, IP address <ref> [5] </ref>. Group membership is dynamic, i.e. hosts can join or leave a group at any time. Group members receive all datagrams addressed to the group, while any host can send to a 2 group, regardless of its membership status. <p> DVMRP v.1 [4] is a variation of Truncated Reverse Path Broadcast <ref> [5] </ref>. Each router uses a separate distribution tree for each source sending to a group, so that datagrams from the source (root) are duplicated only when paths towards destination networks (leaves) diverge. <p> As a result, a broadcast tree is formed and data-grams reach all routers. Since each router knows which groups are present in its LAN, redundant datagrams are not forwarded there, thus truncating the tree. The latest incarnation of this mechanism, DVMRP v.3 [10], uses the improved Reverse Path Multicast <ref> [5] </ref> algorithm, which prunes tree branches leading to networks that have no members for a group, and grafts them back when such members appear. Another mechanism in use is the Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF) [8] protocol, based on a link state algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Although multicast is harder to implement, IP extensions that support it have been developed, leading to the deployment of the Mbone, a wide area testbed <ref> [6] </ref> used for experimentation with multicast enabled applications. Audio and video conferencing and distribution applications were among the early adopters of the MBone, due to multicast's potential for bandwidth savings for multipoint communications. <p> In this case, tunnels are used, i.e. virtual links between two multicast routers that are composed of a sequence of physical links. Multicast datagrams are relayed between the tunnel endpoints by being encapsulated within unicast datagrams at the sending end and decapsulated at the receiving end. The MBone <ref> [6] </ref> is a virtual network composed of multicast aware networks bridged by tunnels.

Reference-contexts: In IGMP v.1 after the last member of a group leaves it, datagrams for the group are still forwarded to the LAN until its membership times out, thus wasting bandwidth. The time between these two events is called the leave latency. To reduce it, in IGMP v.2 <ref> [7] </ref> a host sends a leave message when abandoning a group if it was the last host to send a membership report for that group. <p> To compute the overhead for each mechanism, we need a set of values for the 11 Fig. 2. Overhead as a percentage of data rate for IGMP v.2 timers and counters of the IGMP variants; we use the values specified in the draft specification for IGMP v.2 <ref> [7] </ref> for both protocols. The specification requires all IGMP hosts to send two unsolicited reports on joining a group, and then reply to periodic queries that are sent every 125 seconds.

Reference-contexts: Another mechanism in use is the Multicast Open Shortest Path First (MOSPF) <ref> [8] </ref> protocol, based on a link state algorithm. In MOSPF routers flood their membership lists among them, so that each one has complete topological information concerning group membership.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the single logical address concept is useful for resource discovery and automatic host configuration, which are becoming more important as host mobility is introduced in IP <ref> [9] </ref>. All servers that provide the same type of service can share a well-known multicast address so that they can be easily located. Finally, group communication based applications, such as dynamic distributed routing, can substitute multicast for broadcast or multiple unicasts for efficiency. <p> Many hosts are connected to their Internet Service Provider (ISP) via a telephone link, that may be either analog or digital, wireline or wireless. The Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) LANs are an example of a PtP link based LAN. Finally, the mobility extensions for IP <ref> [9] </ref> support local multicast distribution using virtual PtP links, or tunnels. All these local PtP links, whether physical or virtual, are sufficiently different from shared medium LANs to warrant closer examination of the implications of transplanting the existing IP multicast mechanisms to them. <p> Mobile hosts have additional battery power and processing constraints that urge for simplified local mechanisms and minimal transmission overhead. Another case of a PtP link is the tunnel used by Mobile IP <ref> [9] </ref> to connect a mobile host to the Internet via tunneling of datagrams from an agent in its home network. <p> The problem is more complicated with virtual PtP links such as Mobile IP tunnels, where delay is unpredictable due to the arbitrary tunnel length, and also varies due to dynamic routing and host mobility. However, estimation of tunnel round trip delay is also an issue with Mobile IP itself <ref> [9] </ref>, thus the mechanism employed there can be reused.

Reference-contexts: When a multicast router is not present on the network visited by a mobile host, local multicast mechanisms are employed over the tunnel by having the home agent act as the multicast router <ref> [12] </ref>. Thus, IGMP operation and multicast delivery is carried out over this virtual PtP link, that includes at least one wireless link, either broadcast or unicast based. Scarce bandwidth and battery power favor local mechanisms that minimize or eliminate leave latency and group management overhead.
