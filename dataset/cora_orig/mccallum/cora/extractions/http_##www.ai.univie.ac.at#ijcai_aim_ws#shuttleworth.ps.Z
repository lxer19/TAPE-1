Title: The Recognition of Musical Structures using Neural Networks

Abstract: This paper describes two neural network architectures for solving problems encountered in the development of an automatic polyphonic music transcription system. The first is that of correctly classifying an input representing a triad. The second problem is to recognise the individual notes in an input pattern representing several notes. Both networks use an input representation which is derived from a spectral analysis of digitised audio signals. The triad classification network is based on an architecture described in [ Laden and Keefe, 1991 ] , a three layer feed-forward network, trained using a back-propagation learning algorithm. The note recognition network uses a variant of the Hopfield neural network architecture, originally applied to the problem of image restoration in [ Zhou et al., 1988 ] . Results for the triad classification network compare favorably with those presented in [ Laden and Keefe, 1991 ] , but it is concluded that such a network is not sufficiently reliable to be used as a central component in a transcription system. The results for the note recognition network are more promising, and an outline is given of a transcription system based upon such a network.

Reference-contexts: Depending on whether each third is major or minor, the triad is classified as diminished, minor, major or augmented. Table 1 summarises the classification. Root/Mediant Mediant/Dominant Classification Interval Interval Minor Minor Diminished Minor Major Minor Major Minor Major Major Major Augmented Table 1: Triad classification based upon constituent intervals <ref> [ Laden and Keefe, 1991 ] </ref> describe a neural network to classify diminished, minor and major triads. This problem is of interest as it requires knowledge of not only the constituent notes of the input, but also their relative positions. <p> MajorAugmented Minor Diminished C]3C3 D3 D]3 E3 F3 F]3 G3 G]3 A3 A]3 B3 Connections are unidirectional (bottom to top). The actual network had more input and hidden units. The network differs from the one described in <ref> [ Laden and Keefe, 1991 ] </ref> in a number of ways: * It attempts to classify all four types of triad. * The data is extracted from real instrument samples, and many more examples were used during training. * The network was trained with the Quickprop variant of the backpropagation algorithm <p> The results compare favourably with those presented in <ref> [ Laden and Keefe, 1991 ] </ref> . The result for their network presented with test input patterns shaped by a simulated instrument power spectrum (Table 4 in [ Laden and Keefe, 1991 ] ) gives a percentage correct for all types of triad of 47%. <p> The results compare favourably with those presented in <ref> [ Laden and Keefe, 1991 ] </ref> . The result for their network presented with test input patterns shaped by a simulated instrument power spectrum (Table 4 in [ Laden and Keefe, 1991 ] ) gives a percentage correct for all types of triad of 47%. The asymptotic error rate of all networks shown in Figure 2 is about 47%. Of course, the comparison is not exact due to the differences between the two networks. <p> Although Laden and Keefe examine this problem in the addendum of <ref> [ Laden and Keefe, 1991 ] </ref> , the approach here is founded upon a Hop-field network architecture. The network is based upon one reported in [ Zhou et al., 1988 ] for image restoration. <p> The columns of Table 2 show the percentage of instances where a unit should be "on" (output value 1 or more) or "off" (output value 0) when it was in fact "on" or "off". This compares favourably with the results in Table 8b. of <ref> [ Laden and Keefe, 1991 ] </ref> , where the "On/On" result is 74% and the "Off/Off" result 98%. Unfortunately, using a "Highest 3 outputs win" crite rion, the network only correctly identifies the notes 38% of the time.

Reference-contexts: The resolution which forms the best compromise between the time and frequency domains depends upon the signal, and hence a multiresolution scheme must be adopted. Previously the Multiresolution Fourier Transform (MFT) has been applied to audio transcription with some success <ref> [ Pearson, 1991 ] </ref> , and the analysis system described below is based upon the MFT, in anticipation of the need to incorporate temporal constraints on the analysis.

Reference-contexts: The Fourier transform gives a linear frequency scale, but the input representation is based upon the fundamental frequencies of the notes, which increase along a log-frequency scale. <ref> [ Sano and Jenkins, 1991 ] </ref> describe a neural network using linear units to perform a mapping from linear frequency to the logarithmic "pitch scale", but here a simple Gaussian weighted average is used, of the frequency bins within half a semitone of the fundamental of a given scale note.

The network is based upon one reported in <ref> [ Zhou et al., 1988 ] </ref> for image restoration. The key to understanding the network lies in interpreting the pattern of harmonics for a note as a linear transformation of an input vector with an impulse occuring at the element corresponding to the note fundamental.
