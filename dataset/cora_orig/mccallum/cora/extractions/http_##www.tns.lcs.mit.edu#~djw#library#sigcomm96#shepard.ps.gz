Abstract: Prior work in the field of packet radio networks has often assumed a simple success-if-exclusive model of successful reception. This simple model is insufficient to model interference in large dense packet radio networks accurately. In this paper we present a model that more closely approximates communication theory and the underlying physics of radio communication. Using this model we present a decentralized channel access scheme for scalable packet radio networks that is free of packet loss due to collisions and that at each hop requires no per-packet transmissions other than the single transmission used to convey the packet to the next-hop station. We also show that with a modest fraction of the radio spectrum, pessimistic assumptions about propagation resulting in maximum-possible self-interference, and an optimistic view of future signal processing capabilities that a self-organizing packet radio network may scale to millions of stations within a metro area with raw per-station rates in the hundreds of megabits per second.

Reference-contexts: such a large-scale metropolitan-area packet radio network. 1 2 Existing models of communication An assumption commonly made since the earliest days of packet radio networks is that any overlap (in time) of multiple transmissions at an intended receiver prevents the successful reception of any packet transmissions involved in the overlap <ref> [1] </ref>. For some modulation and detection schemes, particularly those that were practical for digital radio transmission the early 1970s, this assumption is reasonable. <p> The most notable recent progress in this area is the MACA-MACAW-FAMA line of work begun by Karn in [9] and continued in [4], [7], and [6]. These schemes are based on a simple model of propagation and interference as all-or-nothing phenomena. In the spirit of the original ALOHA <ref> [1] </ref>, they are asynchronous, and provide random access to the channel. With these techniques, if there is no other traffic and a packet arrives to be sent at some station, then that station can immediately begin the protocol for accessing the channel.

Reference-contexts: Then traditional (non-radio) packet-network design and performance analysis techniques may be brought to bear. A textbook method for ensuring non-interfering use of the channel is to assume system-wide synchronization and control, divide time into non-overlapping slots, and assign a compatible set of transmissions to occur in each time slot <ref> [3] </ref>. Work has progressed on methods of finding good assignments of transmissions to slots (e.g. [14]). <p> If (as discussed in Section 5) we are only concerned about interference from the receiving station's own transmitter, then meeting this constraint can be easily accomplished: the sending station only needs to know 11 For example, the Distributed Asynchronous Bellman-Ford Algorithm is described in <ref> [3] </ref>. at what times the receiving station may be transmitting. If the receiver's schedule is known by the sending station, then the sending station can choose to send the packet at some other time.

Reference-contexts: Modeling the intricacies of radio interference is problematic at the system design level, and earlier work in multihop packet-radio performance analysis (e.g. [24], <ref> [11] </ref>, and [23]) has always sought to simplify the criteria for which situations do and do not lead to successful reception of a packet. Commonly the goal is to get to a nodes-and-edges view of the network where interference between stations not connected by an edge may be safely ignored.

Reference-contexts: The power per unit area falls off as the inverse square of the distance from the source. The voltage measured on the feedline is proportional to the square root of the power on the feedline. See <ref> [15] </ref> Chapter 4. 4 The relationship between signal-to-noise ratio and the Shannon bound on communication rate is essentially linear when the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly less than one. I.e. log 2 (1 + x) in Eq. 3 is x ln 2 (approximately 1:44x) when x t 1. <p> The distance at which this attenuation occurs is sometimes called the radio horizon and is often modeled as if it be haved like a visual horizon of an earth with the radius increased to 4 3 of the actual earth's radius.

At M.I.T., this work was supported in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency under contract number DABT63-92-C-0002 and the author was supported in part by an AT&T-Bell Laboratories Ph.D. Scholarship sponsored by the AT&T Foundation. <p> Simulations of small networks (consisting of only 100 or 1000 stations) were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the channel access scheme and verify the analysis, and are reported briefly here (and more extensively in <ref> [18] </ref>). <p> In <ref> [18] </ref> the parameters of this scheduling method are explored and a 30% receive-duty cycle is found to be nearly-optimal for a wide range of situations. <p> So an individual station may spend about 70% of the time transmitting, and the expected fraction of time at which transmission is possible to any individual neighbor is 21% (30% of 70%). In <ref> [18] </ref> is also presented a method of scheduling the packets into the slots by limiting the packets to a small fixed-size one-fourth the length of a slot time. <p> Even with other traffic, a station need not block the head of the line. Traffic to other stations may be transmitted while waiting for a suitable time to arrive. With no head-of-line blocking, stations may achieve transmit duty cycles approaching 50% (as demonstrated in <ref> [18] </ref>). 7.3 Respecting neighbors' receive windows So far, we have developed a method of avoiding interference from a receiving station's own transmitter. Now we will extend this method to avoid all significant interference from local sources. <p> The factor of 20 means that if the signal at a nearby neighbor will, at a neighbor, be more than 13 dB above the usual reception power level, then it cannot be sent during that neighbor's receive windows.
