Abstract: We describe the Informedia tm News-on-Demand system. News-on-Demand is an innovative example of indexing and searching broadcast video and audio material by text content. The fully-automatic system monitors TV news and allows selective retrieval of news items based on spoken queries. The user then plays the appropriate video "paragraph". The system runs on a Pentium PC using MPEG-I video compression and the Sphinx-II continuous speech recognition system [6]. The Informedia Digital Video Library Project [4] at Car-negie Mellon University is creating a digital library of text, images, videos and audio data available for full content retrieval. Through the integration of technologies from the fields of natural language understanding, image processing, speech recognition and video compression, the Infor-media System [1] allows a user to explore multi-media data in depth as well as in breadth. An overview of the structure of the Informedia system is shown in Figure 1. The Informedia system for video libraries goes far beyond the current paradigm of video-on-demand, retrieving and displaying short video paragraphs in response to the user's query. As a result, a large body of video material can be searched with very little effort. While our work is centered around processing news stories from TV broadcasts, the system exemplifies an approach that can make any video, audio or text data accessible. The same methods can be used to index and search other streamed multi-media data by content. News on Demand. One particularly significant application of the Informedia Digital Video Library deals with television and radio news. news is broadcast at a particular time, and if a person is not in front of a TV or radio at that time, the information becomes virtually inaccessible. There is simply not enough time to scan through tapes of yesterday's news for relevant stories. In addition, the viewer must watch all stories in a news show, without the ability to select which stories to skip and which to pursue in more detail. We can distinguish two distinct phases in the Informedia News-On-Demand process: library creation and library exploration. Library creation deals with the accumulation of information, transcription, segmentation and indexing.
