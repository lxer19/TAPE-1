Abstract: It is shown that if a formula is constructed from noisy 2-input NAND gates, with each gate failing independently with probability ", then reliable computation can or cannot take place according as " is less than or greater than " 0 = (3 p

This type of argument first appears in the work of Hajek and Weller <ref> [HW] </ref> (Section IV, Proposition 3). A consequence of this style of argument is that the constructed formulas may suffer increased probability of error, for certain inputs, if their gates enjoy a decreased probability of failure.

Reference-contexts: The clones of Boolean functions have been completely classified; see Post [P2]. The case in which computation is to be done by noisy NAND gates is one considered by von Neumann <ref> [N] </ref>. He was considering circuits rather than formulas, and he was employing different input-output conventions (using bundles of wires rather than single wires), so his quantitative results are not strictly comparable to ours. <p> This theorem will be proved in Section 2 by methods similar in spirit to, but much more elaborate than, those originally used by von Neumann <ref> [N] </ref>. <p> Lower Bound We shall begin with a crude argument that shows that reliable computation is possible if " &lt; (3 22 14)=6 = 0:01187 : : : . This result is due in essence to von Neumann <ref> [N] </ref>, though he does not state it explicitly. In his discussion of computation with NAND gates, he states a slightly weaker result, but he is employing a different model at that point, and his results are strictly speaking incomparable to the ones presented here.
