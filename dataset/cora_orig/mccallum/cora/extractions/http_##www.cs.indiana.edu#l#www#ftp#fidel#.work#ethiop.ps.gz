Reference-contexts: These migrants brought with them their Semitic languages (Sabaean and perhaps others) and script (Old Epigraphic South Arabic) and monumental stone architecture (based on information from <ref> [2, 4] </ref>). There exist 86 different languages (4 of them extinct), classified in four major language families with around 200 dialects. Three language families belong to the Afro-Asiatic super-language family: Semitic (represented by the branches Ethio-Semitic and Arabic), Cushitic, and Omotic.

Reference-contexts: In addition, L A T E X (a macro that enriches the development of T E X) and babel (a special package to support non-Latin scripts) have contributed to boost text processing technology in different scripts. For this reason we developed the ethiop package <ref> [5] </ref> for Ethiopian script supported by the babel package which is a collection of METAFONT and T E X / L A T E X macros. The package helps to typeset the character sets of the different languages in Ethiopia and Eritrea.

Reference-contexts: Although we wrote our own set of macros to handle the activation, we soon decided not to introduce yet another incompatible mechanism for this task. Instead we used the babel package by Johannes L. Braams <ref> [6] </ref> as framework for the implementation. The T E X macros are derived from the file language.skeleton provided with that package, which also allows a more well-rounded support of multiple languages. The babel package is a collection of T E X macros that simplify the typesetting of multi-lingual documents.

Reference-contexts: The genuine EthT E X package can be found on CTAN in the directory language/ethiopia/ethtex/ or in http://www.neosoft.com/ ethiosys/ <ref> [7] </ref>. We changed the existing letters a little to make them more robust at low resolutions. The major part of the work was spent on adding new characters that were not present in the original fonts.

To develop the package, fortunately, we did not have to start from scratch, because there were some Ethiopian fonts available already.

Reference-contexts: However, the SERA encoding was not realizable as an input encoding for T E X. As far as the encoding is concerned, we have also referred to different sources adopted by different groups and individual scholars. These are the transliteration and transcription codings by E. Hammerschmidt [10], Guidi <ref> [9] </ref>, Littmann/ Hoefner [16], Leslau [15], SERA [21], and that mostly used by the University of Addis Ababa [20]. All the adopted systems have their peculiar features. In most of the cases almost all consonant representations are similar. The main difference is in the representation of the respective vowels.

E.g. <ref> [20] </ref> the m in smnt is doubled (semment) but not written, whereas in smm (se-mem) it is doubled in written form but not in pronounciation, and in fi*nn (mak w annenenna) both occur. Several solutions are possible.
