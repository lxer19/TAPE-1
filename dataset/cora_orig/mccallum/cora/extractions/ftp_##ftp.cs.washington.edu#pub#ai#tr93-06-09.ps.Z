Reference-contexts: This paper should give the reader of sense of the simulator's structure and an agent's capabilities. We will ignore many of the simulator's features, in particular deferring a discussion of multiple agents and communication to a subsequent paper [2]. A reference manual <ref> [1] </ref> provides still more detail. consists of three parts: * A panel showing the truck's status: its fuel level, heading, speed setting, operational status, and so on. This panel appears in the window's upper-left corner. * A panel showing what objects are present at the truck's current location. <p> Roads also have a composition parameter| bumpy roads tend to break fragile objects in the truck's cargo bays, muddy roads tend to make the truck stuck unless it's equipped with mud tires. <ref> [1] </ref> contains a complete description of truck and world parameters, and their effects on truck commands. 3 Sensing The truck gathers its information about the world through sensor objects.

For demonstration purposes we provide a single-process version of the Truckworld: a single client runs synchronously with the simulator.
