Abstract: We present a new parsing paradigm. Rather than treating words as passive objects of grammar rules, the field theory parser views words as particles exerting forces of attraction towards other particles. This force is estimated by a statistical model that is indexed by syntactic and semantic features of the words involved. The parser achieves high performance from relatively small training sets. Another challenge is to move in the direction of full understanding of texts. Deep understanding of free text is too complex for a system to go immediately from the text to its meaning in one step. The problem is typically divided into several steps that include syntactic parsing, followed by semantic interpretation of the resulting parse graph. The parser presented here is part of an IE system for medical reports, which we are initially developing for the domain of radiology reports. These are free text narratives in which a physician describes findings in a chest x-ray. The goal of our system is to extract all information from these reports about the medical findings: their attributes and anatomical location, and the interpretation of the findings. Figure 2 shows the dependency graph for the sample sentence. A directed arc from word A to word B in the dependency graph indicates that A is a modifier of B. This general notion of head-modifier relations is used for all syntactic dependencies in a sentence including verbal complements (the arc from "increased" to "mass") and prepositional phrase attachment (the arc from "segments" to "within" and from "within" to "mass"). This paper introduces a parser based on a novel paradigm. Rather than using grammar rules to drive the parsing, our field theory parser treats words as active agents that exert attractive forces similar to those in atomic physics. This attraction is modeled statistically, so the field theory parser can be considered to be a statistical parser. Charniak (Charniak 1994) and Allen (Allen 1995) are good resources for an overview of statistical parsers. Some statistical parsers have the drawback of requiring a large set of manually constructed grammar rules (Briscoe and Carroll 1993) (Charniak 1997). These parsers use statistics to learn preferences between alternate rules in the grammar. Like the some recent statistical parsers (Magerman 1995) (Collins 1996), the field theory parser is not based on grammar rules. This is an advantage in processing medical texts, since the
