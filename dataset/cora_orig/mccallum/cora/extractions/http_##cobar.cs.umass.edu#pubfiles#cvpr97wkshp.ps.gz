Title: Retrieving Images by Similarity of Visual Appearance  
Author: S. Ravela R. Manmatha 
Address: Amherst  
Affiliation: Multimedia Indexing and Retrieval Group University of Massachusetts,  
Abstract: A system to retrieve images using a description of visual appearance is presented. A multi-scale invariant vector representation is obtained by first filtering images in the database with Gaussian derivative filters at several scales and then computing low order differential invariants. The multi-scale representation is indexed for rapid retrieval. Queries are designed by the users from an example image by selecting appropriate regions. The invariant vectors corresponding to these regions are matched with those in the database both in feature space as well as in coordinate space and a match score is obtained for each image. The results are then displayed to the user sorted by the match score. From experiments conducted with over 1500 images of objects embedded in arbitrary backgrounds, it is shown that images similar in appearance and whose viewpoint is within 25 degrees of the query image can be retrieved with an average precision 1 of 57.4%.

Reference-contexts: We begin with a simple approach wherein the feature vector is the local 2-jet without the zeroth order term, computed at a fixed scale <ref> [17] </ref>. <p> Note that similar images within the database occur at different sizes. While the above mentioned method as stated does not account for large relative size changes between a query and a matching database image, however, it has been extended to handle a range of size changes, discussed in <ref> [17] </ref>. From the experiments (see Section 7) the following observations are made. First, vector correlation performs well under small view variations. Typically, in-plane rotations of up to 20 o and out-of-plane rotations of up to 30 o can be tolerated. <p> Second, a range of size variations, determined a priori, can be handled by searching across the scale parameter of the Gaussian. In particular similar objects within size changes of 1 4 : : : 4 could be retrieved <ref> [17] </ref>. Finally it is observed that as images become more dissimilar their response vectors become less correlated, starting at the higher order. <p> For the steam query there are 12 "similar" images (as determined by a person), 9 of which are ranked in the top 20. Finally, for the diesel query there are 30 "similar" images, 12 of which are found in the top 20 retrievals. Pictorial results are shown in <ref> [17] </ref>. Wrong instances of retrieval are of two types. The first is where the correlation performs well but the objective of the query is not satisfied. In this case the 3 The average retrieval rate for text-based systems is 50% 7 No. <p> These images are also observed to be visually similar and we posit that this method has good potential for image retrieval. While a discussion of matching objects across different sizes was presented and has been implemented elsewhere <ref> [17] </ref> using correlation, in this paper, the multi-scale invariant vector was used only to robustly characterize appearance. The next immediate step is to explicitly incorporate matching across size variations akin to the correlation approach.

Reference-contexts: The intensity function of the image, on the other hand, need not satisfy this condition. However, it is well known that the derivative of a possibly discontinuous function can be made well posed if it is convolved with the derivative of a smooth test function <ref> [19] </ref>.
