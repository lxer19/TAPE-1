Abstract: The complexity of circuit designs has necessitated a top-down approach to layout synthesis. A large body of work shows that a good partitioning hierarchy, as measured by the associated Rent parameter, will correspond to an area-efficient layout. We define the intrinsic Rent parameter of a netlist to be a lower bound on the Rent parameter of any partitioning hierarchy for the netlist. Experimental results show that spectra-based ratio cut partitioning methods yield partitioning hierarchies with the lowest observed Rent parameter over all benchmarks and over all algorithms tested. For examples where the intrinsic Rent parameter is known, spectral ratio cut partitioning yields a Rent parameter essentially identical to this theoretical optimum. We provide additional theoretical results supporting the close relationship between spectral partitioning and the intrinsic Rent parameter. These results have deep implications with respect to the choice of partitioning algorithms and new approaches to layout area estimation.

Reference-contexts: With this in mind, the ratio cut formulation [17] allows a tradeoff between nets cut and evenness in the partition: the numerator captures the minimum-cut criterion while the denominator favors near-bisection.

Previous approaches fall into several classes, as surveyed in [6] [13]. The greedy iterative paradigm is popular either as a stand-alone strategy or as a postprocessing refinement to other methods.

Reference-contexts: This result has key implications in two areas. First, it provides strong confirmation of previous work by Wei and Cheng [17], who were the first to propose the ratio cut partitioning objective; it also confirms work of Hagen and Kahng <ref> [6] </ref>, who proposed using the spectral approach for ratio cut partitioning. Second, a natural application of our work lies in the development of better predictive layout tools, which 1 are critical to efficient search of the layout solution space. <p> We describe Rent's relationship as a natural outgrowth of ratio cut partitioning and the ratio cut cost function. Based on this relationship, we show that Rent's parameter can be analytically related to the theoretically derived lower bound on the ratio cut metric presented in <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> It is well known that both minimum-cut bisection and minimum ratio cut are NP-complete [5], (the latter by reduction from Bounded Min-Cut Graph Partition) so heuristic methods must be used.

Iterative methods are based on local perturbation of the current solution and typically entail variations of the Kernighan-Lin method [8], particularly the algorithmic speedup of Fiduccia and Mattheyses [4]. <p> Early theoretical work connecting graph spectra and partitioning as surveyed in [13] formulate the partitioning problem as the assignment or placement of nodes into bounded-size clusters or chip locations. The problem is then transformed into a quadratic optimization, and Lagrangian relaxation is used to derive an eigenvector formulation. In <ref> [6] </ref>, Hagen and Kahng established a close relationship between the optimal ratio cut cost and the second-smallest eigenvalue of the matrix Q = D A, where D and A are as defined above: Theorem 1 (Hagen-Kahng): Given a graph G = (V; E) with adjacency matrix A, diagonal degree matrix D, <p> This result suggests that the eigenvector x corresponding to , i.e., the solution of the matrix equation Qx = x, be used to guide the partitioning. For ratio cut partitioning, <ref> [6] </ref> used x to induce a linear ordering of the modules, and the best "split" in terms of ratio cut cost was returned. <p> The spectral method is appealing for its use of global rather than local information, and it also provides an inherently spatial embedding of the circuit graph. Because the spectral approach significantly outperforms iterative Fiduccia-Mattheyses style methods <ref> [6] </ref>, Section 4 uses the spectral ordering as the basis for ratio cut partitioning variants. 4 The Intrinsic Rent Parameter: Ex perimental Results Within the preceding taxonomy, the main classes of partitioning algorithms of interest for top-down layout generation are greedy iterative methods (in particular, Fiduccia-Mattheyses minimum-cut bisection) and methods that <p> Given a circuit C, let U and W be the partitions re 6 The sole exception: Primary1 with traversal (i) for SpecRC-Full, where the fit was done on only five data points. sulting from applying a spectral ratio cut partitioning to C.

Reference-contexts: Previous work in the field of area estimation has shown that the so-called Rent parameter <ref> [12] </ref> is an accurate indicator of the wiring requirements for a given partitioning hierarchy. In particular, given a choice between two recursive bipartitioning hierarchies, the one with lower Rent parameter will require less wire-length and correspond to a denser final layout. <p> This relation was first observed by E. F. Rent of IBM in the late 1960s and independently by several others. Landman and Russo <ref> [12] </ref> performed an extensive study of the relation via partitioning experiments on large "real-life" circuits, and observed Rent parameter values p between 0.47 and 0.75. 1 Following Mandelbrot [14], one may view Rent's rule as a dimensionality relationship between pinout of a module and the number of gates in the module. <p> Landman and Russo in <ref> [12] </ref> also made the fundamental observation that the Rent parameter will depend upon both the structure of the circuit and the partitioning algorithm chosen. <p> Our plotted data points represent the average 4 number of external terminals and modules per subpartition for each partition level. Last, we followed the methodology of <ref> [12] </ref> and divided our data points into two regions: Region I where Rent's rule applies (and wherein we perform the regression), and Region II where the rule breaks down. <p> The results indicate that SpecRC-1/4 and SpecRC-Full generate partitioning hierarchies with uniformly 4 While previous work has calculated the Rent parameter <ref> [12] </ref> using arithmetic averaging, we derive the experimental data below using geometric averaging at each partition level; this a more "natural" average on the log-log scale.
