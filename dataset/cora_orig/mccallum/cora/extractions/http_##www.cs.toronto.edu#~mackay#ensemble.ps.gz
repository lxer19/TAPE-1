Reference-contexts: Hinton and Zemel (1994) view the input-to-hidden `recognition' part of the autoencoder as defining an approximating distribution Q for this distribution P . A single objective function F can then be defined for simultaneous optimization of the generative model and the recognition model. The Helmholtz machine <ref> (Dayan et al. 1995) </ref> is a further generalization of these ideas. In a broader statistical context, Neal and Hinton (1993) have shown that it is possible to view the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in terms of a free energy minimization.

Reference-contexts: F () is bounded below by log P (DjH) and only attains this value for Q (w; ) = P (wjD; H). For 1 Variational free energy minimization is a well-established tool for the approximation of probability distributions in statistical physics <ref> (Feynman 1972) </ref>. The free energy can also be described in terms of description lengths, as in Hinton and van Camp (1993). certain models and certain approximating distributions, this free energy, and its derivatives with respect to the ensemble's parameters, can be evaluated.

Reference-contexts: In a broader statistical context, Neal and Hinton (1993) have shown that it is possible to view the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in terms of a free energy minimization. The Bayesian (ML II) approach to the optimization of hyperparameters in a hierarchical model (reviewed in <ref> (MacKay 1992) </ref>) can also be derived as a free energy minimization (MacKay 1995a). The deterministic Boltzmann machine can be derived as a free energy approximation to the Boltzmann machine (Radford Neal, personal communication).
