Abstract: The Integrated Processing and Understanding of Signals (IPUS) architecture is designed for complex environments, which are characterized by variable signal to noise ratios, unpredictable source behaviors, and the simultaneous occurrence of objects whose signal signatures can distort each other. Because auditory scene analysis is replete with issues concerning the relationship between SPA-appropriateness and multi-sound interactions in complex environments, much of our experimental work with IPUS has focused on applying the architecture to this problem. In this paper we present our work-in-progress in scaling-up our IPUS sound understanding testbed to accommodate a library of 50 sounds covering a range of types (e.g. impulsive, harmonic, periodic, chirps) and to analyze scenarios with three or four sounds.

Reference-contexts: Noisebeds represent the wideband component of a sound source's acoustic signature. Microstreams often form "ridges" on top of noisebed "plateaux," but not ev ery noisebed has an associated microstream. 11. On the eleventh level we apply perceptual streaming criteria developed in the psychoacoustic research community <ref> [1] </ref> to group microstreams and noisebeds as support for stream hypotheses, or entities to be recognized as sound-sources. Specifically, our testbed knowledge sources group microstreams together when they have similar fates (e.g. synchronized onset- and end-times, synchronized chirp behavior), or when they share a harmonic relationship.

Reference-contexts: In the next section we present two techniques the C.2 testbed uses to produce approximate hypotheses that help to limit the architec ture's search for signal interpretations while reducing the time spent by the testbed's front-end on initial analysis of the signal. Testbed Approximate Processing Techniques Approximate processing <ref> [2] </ref> refers to the concept of deliberately limiting search processes in order to trade off certainty for reduced execution time.

Reference-contexts: In this case, certainty in the answer obtained is reduced because it may be different from the answer obtained with the full set of constraints. We use several versions of an STFT approximation algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> that sacrifices certainty (i.e. frequency resolution, time resolution, or spectral coverage) in its output data in exchange for a reduction in processing time by an order of magnitude below the precise STFT's requirements.

Reference-contexts: This is a new representation in the C.2 configuration that was not in the C.1 configuration. 3. The third level contains spectral hypotheses derived for each waveform segment through algorithms such as the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and the Wigner Distribution <ref> [7] </ref>. One of the SPAs for producing hypotheses on this level, the Quantized STFT, is new to the C.2 configuration and is dis cussed in the next section. 4. The fourth level contains peak hypotheses derived for each spectrum.
