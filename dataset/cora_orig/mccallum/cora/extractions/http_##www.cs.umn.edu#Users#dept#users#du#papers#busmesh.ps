Abstract: A new media access protocol is presented for time and wavelength division multiplexed optical passive star networks. The protocol is based on a new "Bus-Mesh" virtual topology. The network provides minimum latency and high throughput while requiring only a single fixed wavelength transmitter and receiver at each station. The use of non-agile, fixed wavelength devices, readily available with current technology, reduces costs, improves reliability and avoids any tuning delays and limitations. The multihop access protocol operates effectively in an environment with lengthy propagation delays. The wavelength division multiplexing system is required to support only a small, easily achievable, number of wavelength channels.

Reference-contexts: The rate at which a tunable transmitter or receiver can tune to a specific wavelength is, in general, inversely related to the tuning range of the device <ref> [3] </ref>. High speed devices usually have a very limited range. Most tunable transmitters are capable of tuning to only a small subset of the system's wavelengths. The need for widely tunable transmitters can be avoided by imposing a logical topology on the network. <p> Like most systems that require agile transmitters or receivers, the throughput of the DT-WDMA and Aloha based systems are significantly affected by lengthy tuning times, which increase with the number of channels. The ability to tune a transmitter over a large range of channels has not yet been demonstrated <ref> [3] </ref>. The Bus-Mesh system show superior throughput over the full range of available wavelengths. The Bus-Mesh protocol can deliver packets to their destination with very little delay. wavelength TDM system. The network delay is shown as a function of the mean arrival rate of new packets to the network.
