Abstract: Natural cloth movement is one of more challenging problems in computer animation. Since it is based on free object movement physics, there are no exact solutions or formulae for exactly representing cloth movement. The two most common approaches are the differential approach and the physical method. This poster presents cloth movement simulation using the physical method.

Reference-contexts: It is less computation intensive and produces more accurate results. The main goal of this project is to find a satisfying method of cloth movement that will closely represent "real-world" movement. 2 Related Work Different approaches have been explored regarding this problem. Ling, Damodaran and Gay <ref> [1] </ref> use the panel method for cloth surface approximation in a differential model. The model is constructed from trapezoidal surfaces and is based on aerodynamic theory and quasi-steady force models.

Reference-contexts: Aerodynamic theory is used to calculate force distribution of the air flow on a cloth surface and quasi-steady model deals with stream velocity of the relative air flow and unsteady air flows. Provot <ref> [2] </ref> uses the mass-spring model to describe rigid cloth behavior. This model is derived from elastically deformable models and is improved to take into account non-elastic properties of woven fabrics.

Reference-contexts: The model is approximated by a network of masses and springs, and the movement is evaluated using the numerical integration of fundamental law of dynamics. Mechanical method and triangular approximation of cloth as a deformable object is used by Vollino, Courchense, Thalmann <ref> [3] </ref>. This model uses irregular triangular meshes and New-ton's motion equation to determine the object's position in small time steps along with a general collision detection algorithm. 3 Approach and Uniqueness System implemented in this project is intended to simulate cloth movement in steady airflow.
