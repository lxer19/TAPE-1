Abstract: We have presented the curvature-velocity method for local obstacle avoidance, which treats the problem as one of constrained optimization in the velocity space of the robot. Advantages of this formulation include the ability to simultaneously control the speed and heading of the robot, the ease of incorporating constraints from both the environment and the robot dynamics, and the ability to handle trade offs between speed, safety, and goal-directedness. CVM achieves real-time performance by approximating how far the robot could travel along a given curvature before hitting an obstacle. The approximation is a piecewise constant function, defined by the curvatures tangent to the obstacles. Additional velocity constraints are added based on the physical limits of the robot and the desire to keep it away from obstacles, or at least to travel slowly when passing nearby obstacles. The method has been implemented and tested on Xavier, a synchro-drive robot (it is also applicable to differentially steered vehicles and to non-holonomic vehicles that travel along circular arcs). The implementation is quite efficient, and enables the robot to travel safely in peopled office environments at speeds up to 60 cm/sec. The limiting factor in speed appears to be the rate of the sonar sensors (the limited field of view of the laser prevents it from being the primary obstacle detection sensor). By improving the cycle time of our sensors, we expect to approach one meter per second travel. Future work based on this method includes finding better approximations to the distance function and trying out more sophisticated objective functions. We would also like to investigate extending the curvature-based velocity space approach to multi-step navigation planning problems. This work has shown that by taking vehicle dynamics into account, and by maximizing an objective function that trades off speed, safety and goal-directedness, we can create an efficient, real-time local obstacle avoidance algorithm that produces safe, smooth, speedy travel in obstacle-strewn environments.
