Title: Speech Actions and Mental States in Task-Oriented Dialogues  
Author: Peter Heeman 
Address: Rochester, New York, 14627  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Rochester  
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a set of speech actions to account for how conversants collaborate in building a domain plan. The actions that we propose are indexical on the current plan, which is part of the mental states of the conversants. The current plan not only includes the actions that have been proposed to solve the problem, but also beliefs about the plans validity and how each action contributes to the overall goal of the plan. The intended effects of the actions are that the current plan is updated.

Reference-contexts: Each speech act type has a role for the speaker, hearer, time, and its content. Below, we will give the content of the speech actions. The content is expressed in a logical form language <ref> (Allen, 1992) </ref>, which will be explained as needed. Definitions of the speech acts have been simplified by removing discourse markers and references to time.

Reference-contexts: The research described in this paper is based on the speech act interpretation work being done as part of the Trains project at the University of Rochester <ref> (Allen and Schubert, 1991) </ref>. The speech act interpretation comes after the syntactic, semantic, and definite description interpretation (Poesio, 1993), and it uses surface features of the utterance to determine possible meanings of the utterance. <p> Third, we give definitions for the speech actions that we use. Fourth, we return to the sample dialogue and give the speech act interpretations for each utterance and sketch how these interpretations are used by the discourse reasoner. An Example Consider the following constructed dialogue <ref> (Allen and Schubert, 1991) </ref> about the Trains-World scenerio given in Figure 1. (1) M: 1 We have to make OJ. M: 2 There are oranges at I and an OJ factory at B. M: 3 Engine E3 is scheduled to arrive at I at 3pm.

Reference-contexts: The plan reasoner, in order to make the plan coherent, will postulate that the oranges at I are to be used to make orange juice and that engine E3 will be used to move them from I to B <ref> (Ferguson, 1992) </ref>. In the fourth utterance, the manager asks if they should ship the oranges.

Reference-contexts: The research described in this paper is based on the speech act interpretation work being done as part of the Trains project at the University of Rochester (Allen and Schubert, 1991). The speech act interpretation comes after the syntactic, semantic, and definite description interpretation <ref> (Poesio, 1993) </ref>, and it uses surface features of the utterance to determine possible meanings of the utterance. The resulting acts are then passed to the speech act pruner, which decides which ones make sense given the context.

Reference-contexts: Disagreements are handled by subsequent judgments and refashioning of the plan, rather than by judgments and refashionings of the previous utterance. So, the current plan, which is in the common ground of the participants, need not be valid, only that the system be able to find it coherent <ref> (Pollack, 1990) </ref>. The plan representation proposed by Ferguson (1992) allows such plans to be represented, as well as partial plans. The Speech Actions We now need to adapt the model of Heeman and Hirst for use in collaborative task-oriented dialogues in general, rather than just referring expressions.

Reference-contexts: The resulting acts are then passed to the speech act pruner, which decides which ones make sense given the context. The output of the pruner is then fed to the discourse reasoner <ref> (Traum, 1993) </ref>, which interacts with the plan reasoner in order to take the appropriate actions. In the rest of the paper, we first look at a sample dialogue to illustrate the speech actions that conversants use when collaborating. Second, we give an overview of our plan-based model of collaboration.

Reference-contexts: At the surface level, they are identical to the suggestions mentioned earlier, and so we rely on discourse expectations in order to disambiguate them. Our approach to replacements is to treat them as the con-junction of an addition to the plan and an argumentative speech action <ref> (Traum and Hinkelman, 1992) </ref>. The argumentative action will be a replace speechact, which takes two roles, one for referring to the speech action that is being used to make the addition, and the second for referring to the judgment speech act.
