Title: Object Identification in a Bayesian Context

Abstract: Object identificationthe task of deciding that two observed objects are in fact one and the same objectis a fundamental requirement for any situated agent that reasons about individuals. Object identity, as represented by the equality operator between two terms in predicate calculus, is essentially a first-order concept. Raw sensory observations, on the other hand, are essentially propositional especially when formulated as evidence in standard probability theory. This paper describes patterns of reasoning that allow identity sentences to be grounded in sensory observations, thereby bridging the gap. We begin by defining a physical event space over which probabilities are defined. We then introduce an identity criterion, which selects those events that correspond to identity between observed objects. From this, we are able to compute the probability that any two objects are the same, given a stream of observations of many objects. We show that the appearance probability, which defines how an object can be expected to appear at subsequent observations given its current appearance, is a natural model for this type of reasoning. We apply the theory to the task of recognizing cars observed by cameras at widely separated sites in a freeway network, with new heuristics to handle the inevitable complexity of matching large numbers of objects and with online learning of appearance probability models. Despite extremely noisy observations, we are able to achieve high levels of performance.

Reference-contexts: The general relationship between perception and the formation of internal models is a subject that needs much more investigation <ref> [ Bacchus et al., 1995 ] </ref> . We showed that the abstract probability of identity can be expressed in terms of measurable appearance probabilities, which define how, when, or where objects that were observed at some point in the past are expected to appear at some point in the future.

Reference-contexts: The horizontal axis corresponds to upstream hue, and the vertical axis corresponds to downstream hue. The appearance probability for color, which includes hue, saturation, and value components, is modeled as a multivariate Gaussian. The core of the approach is the observation, from <ref> [ Cox and Hingorani, 1994 ] </ref> , that a most probable assignment (pairing all n vehicles) can be found in time O (n 3 ) by formulating the problem as a weighted bipartite matching problem and using any of several well-known algorithms for this task.

Reference-contexts: A low threshold implies high coverage and low accuracy, while a high threshold implies low coverage and high accuracy. Our results are comparable with those obtained by Petty et al. <ref> [ Petty et al., to appear ] </ref> , who use an ensemble matching approach that detects downstream propagation of distinct arrival time patterns.
