Title: Distributed Multimedia Applications and Quality of Service  
Author: ASurvey Andreas Vogel a Brigitte Kerherv e b Gregor v. Bochmann c Jan Gecsei c 
Abstract: Quality of service (QoS) is becoming an issue of increasing importance in distributed multimedia systems. This paper presents an overview of the QoS issues involved in the design of such systems. QoS-related parameters can be identified in all system components. We will discuss QoS parameters found in communication protocols, operating systems, multimedia databases, file servers, as well as those directly concerned with the human user. The management of QoS parameters can be seen as an overall negotiation process involving various aspects such as dynamic adaptation and translation of parameters between different abstraction levels. First we present some approaches to this management found in the literature, then we describe features of our own QoS project.

Reference-contexts: In order to guarantee some given values of these QoS parameters, resource reservation becomes necessary. Different schemes have been developed as shown in The DASH approach Anderson, Herrtwich, and Schaefer have presented a resource reservation protocol for guaranteed performance communication in IP-based distributed systems, called Session Reservation Protocol (SRP) <ref> [2] </ref>. This protocol allows to reserve resources, such as CPU and network bandwidth, in order to achieve giv en delay and throughput. SRP is based on the DASH resource model [3]. The Tenet approach The Tenet approach [29] provides a set of schemes and protocols for multimedia communication.

Reference-contexts: Additional problems arise from the very large data volumes stored and from concurrent access to the data, such as required in movie-on-demand type services. Examples of research in this area include the continuous media file servers designed at the University of California at Berkeley <ref> [4] </ref>, University of California at San Diego [70] and University of Lancaster [52]. Results on different types of disk management has been reported, e.g. by Tobagi et al. [76], Kandlur, Chen, and Shae [47] and Dey, Shih, and Kumar [27]. 3. QoS negotiation and re-negotiation 3.1.

Reference-contexts: Until recently, this fact has not been sufficiently emphasized in the literature. With respect to synchronization issues, the question has been discussed by Steinmetz and Engler [74]. Apteker et al. <ref> [5] </ref> have inv estigated the relationship between user acceptance and QoS degradation. A general view on the user's perspective is giv en by Kalkbrenner et al.

Reference-contexts: However, for such applications the protocol can be easily customized. We see future work in the integration of QoS within distributed application platforms or middleware. Work in this area has already been started extending ANSAware [61,21], within the Touring machine project <ref> [6] </ref> and OSF's Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) [73]. Also we see the challenge to include QoS negotiation protocols into the web's http protocol. Acknowledgement We are particularly grateful to our colleagues of the QoS sub-project: R. Dssouli, A.

Reference-contexts: Numerous proposals have been presented for querying multimedia databases [35] and video databases [63]. In the domain of standardization, work is being done mainly in two directions: standardization of database languages and standardization of multimedia and hyper-media documents. The first direction includes standard propositions for an object-oriented database language <ref> [7] </ref> and for the SQL database query language evolution [54]. The main ongoing efforts in the second direction are MHEG [68], Hytime [60] or extensions of ODA [39].

Reference-contexts: Four reliability classes: ignoring, discarding, indicating, correcting corrupt data, have been suggested for HeiTP. This approach is motivated by the use of compression for isochronous data such as MPEG, where corrupted data packages can have more severe consequences than in transmitting uncompressed video. The BERKOM approach The BERKOM approach <ref> [11] </ref> provides a transport system similar to HeiTS. The transport service (called multimedia transport service MMTS) supports the following QoS parameters: transport service data unit maximum size, throughput, end-to-end transit delay, and four reliability classes. The multimedia transport protocol MMTP is also implemented on the top of ST-II. 2.5.3.

Reference-contexts: Another direction of research has been the development of integrated approaches including the mapping of QoS parameters between different layers. A well developed example is the work on a QoS architecture done within the QoS-A project at the University of Lancaster <ref> [12] </ref> which covers QoS from a distributed application platform to ATM including parameter mappings. QoS-A includes a transport protocol comparable to the HeiTP and BERKOM's MMTP, implemented on top of ST-II. 3.4. Example Scenario A user would like to browse an image database.

Reference-contexts: The data definition language must support a powerful conceptual data model providing concepts for basic objects, composite objects and relationships [82]. These concepts are generally present in different object models [9] supported by existing object oriented database management systems <ref> [14] </ref>. Nevertheless, some of these data models have to be enhanced in order to meet the specific characteristics of multimedia objects. The data manipulation language enables the user to insert, retrieve, modify and delete objects in the database. Considerable work has been dedicated to query languages for multimedia databases.

Reference-contexts: The idea here is to encode video in different layers where the lowest layer contains basic information on a frame such as luminance, while higher layers carry additional information, e.g. chromi-nance or bits for increased resolution. Chiueh and Katz <ref> [16] </ref> present a coding scheme called the Gaussian and Laplacian Pyramid, using layering to control progressively the size of the video. Girod [34] reviews coding schemes with respect to scalability and promotes resolution hierarchies as an approach to building a scalable video code.

Reference-contexts: The adaptation can be initiated by the client or by the network. Another example of a resource reservation protocol which provides for dynamic changes of QoS parameters of an established channel is the Capacity-Based Session Reservation Protocol (CBSRP) <ref> [17] </ref>. ST-II The Experimental Internet Stream Protocol, Version 2 (ST-II) [78] is a network layer protocol providing point-to-multipoint services. It provides facilities to negotiate and reserve resources for packet-size and data rate.

Reference-contexts: A similar approach has been presented by Nakajima et al. [59] with a model for real-time server for predictable services. The server is implemented and evaluated in a RT Mach environment. Another micro kernel approach is described by Coulson and Blair <ref> [20] </ref>. An example for operating systems outside the Unix world is OS/2. Parsons reports on a multimedia architecture based on OS/2 [66]. The real-time capabilities of OS/2 have been evaluated as sufficient for multimedia applications. Operating system-related QoS parameters can be identified at different abstraction levels.

Reference-contexts: Standard Unix systems generally do not meet these requirements. For example, Nieh et al. have examined the SVR4 UNIX Scheduler [62] and found it unacceptable for multimedia applications. Similar investigations have been done within the Mach operating system <ref> [23] </ref>, leading to the following conclusion: ``For real-time and multimedia systems that are limited by the worst-case performance, Mach imposes a very high overhead.''. Solutions proposed for these problems consist in extending existing operating systems or in re-implementing Unix systems.

Reference-contexts: SCMP controls the broadcast tree, that is, adding and removing target addresses, and negotiating and setting QoS parameters. ST only delivers data packages through this broadcast tree. The HeiTS approach Heidelberg Transport System (HeiTS) includes a transport protocol, Heidelberg Transport Protocol (HeiTP) on top of an ST-II implementation <ref> [24] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The second level contains schemes using both intra-frame and inter-frame coding. Examples are MPEG and the ITU standard for video telephony H.261 [51]. This level of coding allows more sophisticated approaches, in particular interaction with a transport system. For example, the approach by Delgrossi et al. <ref> [25] </ref> is based on sending I, P and B frames of an MPEG coded video over streams with different priorities. I frames (intra-frame coding) are sent with higher priority than P and B frames. <p> The idea of RSVP: A New Resource Reservation Protocol [84] is to broadcast scaled versions of multimedia data on different streams along with additional control information. Clients may then establish only those connections carrying streams necessary to satisfy their QoS requirements. The approach by Delgrossi et al. <ref> [25] </ref> is also based on the possibility of splitting multimedia data into separate streams having different QoS features.

To this end the SETUP and CONNECT messages include the information elements End-to-End Tr ansit Delay and ATM User Cell Rate.

Reference-contexts: However, with broadcast applications the negotiation is more complex because different clients may have different QoS constraints. A suitable approach is the New Resource Reservation Protocol (Section 2.5.3) based on the scaled media approach (Section 2.2). An example for QoS negotiation for multimedia conferencing is given by Elliot <ref> [28] </ref>. However, the parameters considered include only the coding format and bandwidth of the communication network. The paper also includes a discussion of the problem of real-time scheduling. 3.2. Monitoring As discussed in Section 4, transport protocols support different reliability classes.

Reference-contexts: This protocol allows to reserve resources, such as CPU and network bandwidth, in order to achieve giv en delay and throughput. SRP is based on the DASH resource model [3]. The Tenet approach The Tenet approach <ref> [29] </ref> provides a set of schemes and protocols for multimedia communication. The QoS parameters supported are bounds on delay, jitter and on the probability of delay violation and of buffer over-ow. The protocol suite includes: Realtime Channel Administration Protocol (RCAP) which sets up the channel and reserves the required resources.

Reference-contexts: A number of projects are concerned with multimedia databases in particular domains such as medical applications [13,15,19,45] and office information systems [40,18]. Each of these systems offers specific predicates for multimedia document retrieval adapted to images, text or graphics. Numerous proposals have been presented for querying multimedia databases <ref> [35] </ref> and video databases [63]. In the domain of standardization, work is being done mainly in two directions: standardization of database languages and standardization of multimedia and hyper-media documents. The first direction includes standard propositions for an object-oriented database language [7] and for the SQL database query language evolution [54].

Reference-contexts: Operating systems The basic QoS constraints on operating systems relate to their real-time behaviour. The critical issues include performance, scheduling, and resource reservation. Herrtwich <ref> [38] </ref> has given an overview of the real-time requirements placed on operating systems to satisfy multimedia applications. Standard Unix systems generally do not meet these requirements. For example, Nieh et al. have examined the SVR4 UNIX Scheduler [62] and found it unacceptable for multimedia applications.

Most of the current work on database languages is focused on the definition and manipulation of multimedia information, and only to a lesser degree on defining and processing the control information such as QoS. It should be possible, for example, to enrich a multimedia query by QoS specification.

Reference-contexts: For example, the Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing [44] refers to QoS as ``A set of quality requirements on the collective behaviour of one or more objects.'' According to ISO <ref> [41] </ref>, ``QoS characteristics are intended to be used to model the actual behavior of systems. <p> Standardization The Reference Model on Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) [71] defines open distributed systems in its computational viewpoint by computational objects communicating through interfaces. These interfaces include QoS parameters. An ongoing standardization activity under the title ``Quality of Service Framework'' <ref> [41] </ref> is an attempt to define a QoS architecture in terms of QoS parameters at different layers in the protocol stack and the mappings between the layers. The most immediate subjects for standardization are the different coding schemes for multimedia documents and communication protocols.

Reference-contexts: Beyond its intuitive meaning as system characteristics that inuence the perceived quality of an application, there is little consensus on the precise meaning, let alone the formal definition of QoS. For example, the Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing <ref> [44] </ref> refers to QoS as ``A set of quality requirements on the collective behaviour of one or more objects.'' According to ISO [41], ``QoS characteristics are intended to be used to model the actual behavior of systems.

Reference-contexts: For example, delay is less important for presentational applications than for conversational ones. However, most applications have both presentational and conversational aspects. Conversational applications can be further classified into on-demand and broadcast services. Some examples of distributed applications are news on demand <ref> [55] </ref>, video on demand [72], teleconferencing [69], collaboration services, [1,36], and tele-robotic applications [56,57]. 1.2.

Reference-contexts: Some of these parameters are mutually dependent; this dependence is expressed by mappings between the system's architectural layers. -10- An application has to take into account all these parameters and to negotiate values which satisfy the constraints of all involved components. Nahrstedt and Smith have presented the QoS broker <ref> [56] </ref> which is in charge of negotiating and translating QoS parameters between different layers. While most previous work on QoS negotiation considered only the QoS parameters of the network or transport subsystem, it is important also to consider the parameters of the end systems.

Reference-contexts: Measurements have shown the suitability of this system for multimedia applications.

Reference-contexts: The critical issues include performance, scheduling, and resource reservation. Herrtwich [38] has given an overview of the real-time requirements placed on operating systems to satisfy multimedia applications. Standard Unix systems generally do not meet these requirements. For example, Nieh et al. have examined the SVR4 UNIX Scheduler <ref> [62] </ref> and found it unacceptable for multimedia applications. Similar investigations have been done within the Mach operating system [23], leading to the following conclusion: ``For real-time and multimedia systems that are limited by the worst-case performance, Mach imposes a very high overhead.''.

Elements of QoS are identified in all components of such applications. Communication protocols, coding schemes, operating systems, continuous file servers, and databases have been identified as the main research areas with respect to QoS.

Reference-contexts: While most previous work on QoS negotiation considered only the QoS parameters of the network or transport subsystem, it is important also to consider the parameters of the end systems. In the case of an application involving remote access to a database, as considered in <ref> [79] </ref> for example, there are three main components involved in the system configuration: the database server, the transport subsystem, and the client work station, as shown in Figure 4.

Reference-contexts: The interface also should be able to memorize user profiles in order to avoid repeating the lengthy selection process with the same user. A variation of the approach ``Quality Query by Example'' has been adapted by Vogel et al. <ref> [80] </ref>. Figure 1 and 2 show the current version of the user interface negotiating and demonstrating QoS parameters demonstrating different quality of images. <p> An example for operating systems outside the Unix world is OS/2. Parsons reports on a multimedia architecture based on OS/2 [66]. The real-time capabilities of OS/2 have been evaluated as sufficient for multimedia applications. Operating system-related QoS parameters can be identified at different abstraction levels. As described in <ref> [80] </ref>, there are low lev el parameters such as performance, scheduling, size of available main and virtual memory. On a more abstract level one can see the QoS of certain services provided by the operating systems, e.g. the throughput and delay of an MPEG-player (in frames/second and milliseconds).

The first level contains coding schemes using intra-frame coding schemes in which each frame is compressed and coded independently, such as in JPEG <ref> [81] </ref>. Such coding methods allow QoS variations only in terms of frame-rate, i.e. decreasing the frame-rate by dropping a certain number of frames. The use of various dithering algorithms may also decrease the quality originally encoded . 1 In the original.

Reference-contexts: The data definition language should allow the specification of the three main components of a multimedia object: its structure, content and presentation (consisting of layout and synchronization scenario) [18,53]. The data definition language must support a powerful conceptual data model providing concepts for basic objects, composite objects and relationships <ref> [82] </ref>. These concepts are generally present in different object models [9] supported by existing object oriented database management systems [14]. Nevertheless, some of these data models have to be enhanced in order to meet the specific characteristics of multimedia objects.

Reference-contexts: In the following sections we will identify QoS parameters in various components of distributed multimedia systems, including user interfaces, communication protocols, operating systems, data bases and file servers . This is followed by an example of a QoS negotiation protocol as implemented in our project on Broadband Services <ref> [83] </ref>. This project focuses on presentational distributed multimedia applications. Functional and architectural details of this project are given in [49,79]. The paper concludes by a short discussion of QoS standardization issues. 2. QoS requirements and parameters in a typical distributed multimedia system 2.1. <p> It should be possible, for example, to enrich a multimedia query by QoS specification. Such facilities should be supported by the database manipulation language. It is part of the objectives of our project <ref> [83] </ref> to specify the database requirements for the manipulation of control information, in particular the QoS parameters and localization rules, to be used in the QoS negotiation protocol. 2.6.2.

Reference-contexts: Thus if the receiving work station has a black and white screen, only a basic layer has to be transmitted and decoded. Zhang et al. developed a resource reservation protocol called RSVP, based on layered coding principles <ref> [84] </ref>. This protocol assumes a server multicasting video over different streams which allows clients to select the required streams according to their QoS requirements. 2.3. End systems The parameters of end systems, e.g. work stations may have a strong impact on the QoS perceived by the user. <p> The multimedia transport protocol MMTP is also implemented on the top of ST-II. 2.5.3. Application layer protocols The assumption of scalable media has been made in many application level protocols. The idea of RSVP: A New Resource Reservation Protocol <ref> [84] </ref> is to broadcast scaled versions of multimedia data on different streams along with additional control information. Clients may then establish only those connections carrying streams necessary to satisfy their QoS requirements.
