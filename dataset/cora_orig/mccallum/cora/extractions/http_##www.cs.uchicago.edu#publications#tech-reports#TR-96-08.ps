Abstract: Despite the progress made in the field of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), it is still a major challenge to build systems that can teach about complex, illstructured domains. A chief reason is that detailed, dynamic modeling of students' knowledge is intractable in such areas, and complete, correct models of expert knowledge are inherently difficult to build. These difficulties have led some to argue that the goal of intelligent tutoring should be abandoned and that more benefit could be provided by systems without tutoring. We believe that there are many areas in which tutorial intervention is essential, particularly for the communication of expertise. In this paper we advocate basing tutorial intervention on an analysis of a student's likely points of interest within a learning environment, rather than on his or her state of knowledge. This interest-focused approach results in considerable simplification of the modeling task, and has other advantages as well. We describe an interest-tracing intelligent tutoring framework that we have been using to build learning environments for such illstructured tasks as selling, managing, and other interpersonal skills using tutorial guidance. Our design is based on case-based reasoning as a model of human problemsolving. Expertise is modeled as an organized library of cases; student modeling is restricted to the considerations that enter into the decision to retrieve and present relevant cases. This paper describes the cognitive theory underlying our tutoring approach, and the implementation of the tutor. We show how it is possible to present useful tutorial intervention based on a student's state of interest, without an overwhelming burden of student modeling.

Reference-contexts: These authors support a view of education that is "constructivist." In this view, knowledge is constructed by students as they learn, not transferred to them by teachers. One of the central tenets of the constructivist view of education is that "wisdom can't be told" <ref> (Bransford, et al., 1989) </ref>; in other words, a student cannot gain expertise just by listening. We see the case-based teaching architecture as an approach that is quite compatible with constructivist theories.

Reference-contexts: Although the study was inconclusive with respect to educational outcomes, probably due to small sample size, Edelson did find the predicted motivational advantages of the case-based teaching architecture (Edelson, in prep.). 36 and as we have argued elsewhere <ref> (Burke & Kass, 1995) </ref>, this technique can be applied to other systems that incorporate user modeling, such as information retrieval systems. 37

Reference-contexts: Many other tutoring systems use some variant of rule-based reasoning as their starting point, for example <ref> (Clancey, 1982) </ref>. However, rule-based systems have not met with great success in areas of complex problemsolving, so called "weak- theory" (Porter, Bareiss, & Holte, 1990) or "open-textured" (Weismann, 1965) domains.

Reference-contexts: The bottom line issue is whether the system improves a trainee's performance in the field, but it is very hard to create the controlled conditions under which differences in performance on a task as complex and varied as sales can be reliably attributed to a particular training experience <ref> (Craig & Kelley, 1990) </ref>. Performance measures, such as annual sales figures, do exist, but they vary greatly from month to month and year to year, even without intervention.

Reference-contexts: We find particularly intriguing Lave and Wenger's (1991) finding that the telling of stories was an important way that knowledge was communicated from experts to novices in apprenticeship situations where explicit instruction was otherwise absent. For those who have moved away from the ITS paradigm, the "non-modelers" from <ref> (Lajoie & Derry, 1993) </ref>, the question has become how to build rich, motivating environments for the student to manipulate and learn from, without making use of explicit tutoring and the modeling it entails.

Reference-contexts: This emphasis means that its strategies look for very simple connections between the student's design and the organization of real animals, so that the explanatory relationship is clear.

The first question the system asks is why the animal should perform this behavior.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge-focused approaches typically do not allow for the possibility that the student might have his or her own valid knowledge that is not part of the expert model <ref> (Halff, 1988) </ref>. This position is only tenable if (a) the tutor's knowledge of the domain is complete and (b) the student has no experiential knowledge that is relevant. SPIEL's domain of complex social skills fits neither of these conditions. Students learning in YELLO never begin as novices.

Reference-contexts: Second, it provides the information needed to index a story appropriately. To add a new case to memory, a case-based reasoner needs not just the information about the case itself, but also a problem-solving context from which an appropriate index can be constructed <ref> (Hammond, Seifert & Gray, 1991) </ref>. A CTA tutor must therefore be sensitive to the student's problemsolving.

Reference-contexts: To augment this experience, the system presents stories about the impact of intelligence analysis on battlefield planning. Another GuSS system, called YELLO, teaches the fine points of selling Yellow Pages advertising <ref> (Kass, et al. 1994) </ref>. Its social simulation allows students to interact with customers, and perform a wide range of selling activities. Its stories are first-person anecdotes told by Yellow Pages account executives about their on-the-job experiences. <p> In this example, the intervention works as follows: Announcement text: A story showing the risks of your approach. Introductory text: You kept talking to the client after the sale was closed. Nothing bad happened but here's a story in which doing that led to problems: 2 See <ref> (Kass, et al., 1994) </ref> for a description of how the natural language interaction in GuSS is created. 11 Transcript of video: I was in the South Bend/Mishawaka area.

Reference-contexts: cost savings, even as a fallback option, then it can be deduced that the student is assuming, as in the story, that the customer will be sold on the benefits. 24 SPIEL has a system of exaggeration rules to sharpen subtle distinctions into recognizable ones, just as Lenat's AM system <ref> (Lenat & Brown, 1984) </ref> used exaggeration to identify interesting mathematical concepts to explore. The exaggeration rule here is IF SPIEL CANNOT RECOGNIZE the student's belief about a certain value, THEN TRY TO RECOGNIZE the most extreme version of that belief.

Reference-contexts: This simulation process is what is typically meant by student modeling. This idea modeling the student's precise state of knowledge by running a simulated student model is elegant but may not be practical, nor a good approximation of what human teachers do <ref> (Lepper, et al. 1993) </ref>. When simple tasks are considered, it may be tractable to model the student's reasoning step-by-step, and develop a detailed representation of the student's state of knowledge. <p> In many one-on-one tutoring situations, the interaction between tutor and student ranges far afield from the particular concept or rule at issue in a particular problem and need not arise in responses to errors, problems or impasses <ref> (Lepper, et al. 1993) </ref>. We find particularly intriguing Lave and Wenger's (1991) finding that the telling of stories was an important way that knowledge was communicated from experts to novices in apprenticeship situations where explicit instruction was otherwise absent.

Reference-contexts: Finally, the problem of consensus always exists in a complex domain with many expert practitioners. ITS researchers have found that their tutors may encode a particular dialect of expertise, aspects of which are not shared by experts who were not part of the development team <ref> (Lesgold and Lajoie, 1991) </ref>. One of the features of our approach is that it is possible for a CTA system to present more than one point of view on a particular issue: developers are not required to take sides. 35 5.1.

Reference-contexts: Student models can be made 3 approximate, intending to represent enough to support intervention but not fully simulating student's cognition. A simplified approach to expert knowledge is found in the SHERLOCK system, which teaches complex electronics troubleshooting <ref> (Lesgold, et al. 1992) </ref>. SHERLOCK's design decomposes the troubleshooting task into a strategic level and a local level. The system is able to reason about the problemsolving process at the strategic level.

Reference-contexts: Studies have shown that the kind of difference found in the example above, socalled "alignable difference" in which the analogs have the same structure but different parts, does have a different psychological status from "non-alignable difference," in which the structures are different <ref> (Markman & Gentner, 1993) </ref>. Subjects rate examples with alignable differences as more similar than those that contain non-alignable differences. 13 What an educational storyteller must do is seek out a relevant story with alignable differences.

Reference-contexts: However, while much intriguing work is being done on unguided learning environments, for example (Roschelle, 1992; Solomon, 1993), it seems clear that there are times when a helpful "teacher" can greatly facilitate the learning process <ref> (Merrill, et al. 1992) </ref>. In order to make tutoring possible, it is necessary to develop more tractable methods of modeling. In this paper, we describe an approach to this problem which combines case-based reasoning techniques for expert modeling with what we call an "interest-focused" approach to modeling students.

Reference-contexts: To compensate for the missing expert, non-modelers have tried to create richer educational interactions through collaborative learning environments in which groups of students work together. In the best of these systems, the interaction among peers results in tutorial interactions that the systems themselves cannot provide <ref> (Roschelle, 1992) </ref>. However, experts do have a contribution to make to novices' learning their knowledge and perspective are of a different character than those of peer learners. This is one reason for the effectiveness of apprenticeship environments (Collins, Brown & Newman, 1989; Lave & Wenger, 1991).

Reference-contexts: Issues that remain The difficulties of modeling expert and student knowledge are the primary technical hurdles involved in the intelligent tutoring methodology. However, just as problematic are the pedagogical implications of the ITS approach <ref> (Scardamalia, et al. 1989) </ref>. Nearly all tutoring systems use error-based intervention: the system waits for the student to make an error and then intervenes with information about how the student could have done it right.

Reference-contexts: Failure-driven learning We see students' reasoning as they perform an unfamiliar task as closely related to the learning process. In particular, we see students as engaging in failure-driven learning <ref> (Schank, 1982) </ref>. Failure-driven learning theory holds that there is a central cycle by which failures unsuccessful results or unmet expectations drive learning. The learner makes predictions about the results of its own actions or the behavior of others, and tests these predictions by observing what happens.

Reference-contexts: The process of understanding a story is a process of forming expectations, monitoring them, and building explanatory structures <ref> (Schank & Abelson, 1977) </ref>. This is very much like the process of failure-driven learning from experience. Hearing a good story is like having a second-hand experience. As we have discussed, cases should provide feedback relevant to student's expectations and provide explanations relevant to student's expectation failures.

Reference-contexts: An explicit guidance component can help avoid this, and can also encourage students to explore assumptions and hypotheses that they may otherwise leave untested (Klahr, Dunbar & Fay, 1990); without guidance, students often tend to see only what confirms their expectations <ref> (Schauble et al., 1991) </ref>, and discount contradictory evidence. To compensate for the missing expert, non-modelers have tried to create richer educational interactions through collaborative learning environments in which groups of students work together.

Reference-contexts: However, the lack of tutoring significantly affects the value students can receive from interacting with a learning environment, particularly a simulation. When a task is nontrivial, an unguided novice may have difficulty interpreting what is happening in a simulation <ref> (Shrager, 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Although we retain active tutorial intervention in our systems so that students get the benefit of expert advice, we model expertise as a library of well-organized cases. Such case-based systems have been shown to be easier to build and maintain than conventional rule-based expert systems <ref> (Simoudis, 1992) </ref>. In this way, the burden of engineering the system's expert knowledge is reduced. We use student modeling as needed to determine what cases are relevant to the student, but this determination of relevance is a simpler task than tracking the student's state of knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Many other tutoring systems use some variant of rule-based reasoning as their starting point, for example (Clancey, 1982). However, rule-based systems have not met with great success in areas of complex problemsolving, so called "weak- theory" (Porter, Bareiss, & Holte, 1990) or "open-textured" <ref> (Weismann, 1965) </ref> domains. CBR seems to hold more promise as an approach to complex problemsolving in illstructured domains (as explored in research such as [Klein & Calderwood, 1988; Klein, Whitaker & King, 1988; Read & Cesa, 1990]).

Reference-contexts: Even when a single source of expertise is considered, the project of representing that expertise necessarily invokes all of the difficulties encountered by expert systems research <ref> (Winograd & Flores, 1986) </ref>. For complex and open-ended tasks, there may be no hard constraints marking off situations that no reasonable solution path would encounter: creative solutions are often distinguished by the fact that they go outside of the normally-accepted constraints. 1.3.
