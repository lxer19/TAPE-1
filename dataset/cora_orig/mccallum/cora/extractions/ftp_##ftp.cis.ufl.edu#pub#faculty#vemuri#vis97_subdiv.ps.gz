Abstract: Recursive subdivision schemes have been extensively used in computer graphics and scientific visualization for modeling smooth surfaces of arbitrary topology. Recursive subdivision generates a visually pleasing smooth surface in the limit from an initial user-specified polygonal mesh through the repeated application of a fixed set of subdivision rules. In this paper, we present a new dynamic surface model based on the Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme, which is a very popular method to model complicated objects of arbitrary genus because of many of its nice properties. Our new dynamic surface model inherits the attractive properties of the Catmull-Clark subdivision scheme as well as that of the physics-based modeling paradigm. This new model provides a direct and intuitive means of manipulating geometric shapes, a fast, robust, and hierarchical approach for recovering complex geometric shapes from range and volume data using very few degrees of freedom (control vertices). We provide an analytic formulation and introduce the physical quantities required to develop the dynamic subdivision surface model which can be interactively deformed by applying synthesized forces in real time. The governing dynamic differential equation is derived using Lagrangian mechanics and a finite element discretization. Our experiments demonstrate that this new dynamic model has a promising future in computer graphics, geometric shape design and scientific visualization.

Reference-contexts: An analytical solution of the governing differential equation can not be obtained in general. However, an efficient numerical implementation can be obtained using finite element analysis techniques <ref> [9] </ref>. For the dynamic subdivision surface model, two types of finite elements are considered normal elements (bicubic patches assigned to the normal faces of the initial mesh) and special elements (collection of infinite number of bicubic patches assigned to each extraordinary vertex of the initial mesh).
