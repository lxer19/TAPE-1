Title: Lower Bounds for Non-Commutative Computation Extended Abstract  
Author: Noam Nisan 
Abstract: We consider algebraic computations which are not allowed to rely on the commutativity of multiplication. We obtain various lower bounds for algebraic formula size in this model: (1) Computing the determinant is as hard as computing the permanent and tight exponential upper and lower bounds are given. (2) Computation cannot be parallelized, as opposed to in the commutative case this solves in the negative an open problem of Miller et al [8]. (3) The question of the power of negation in this model is shown to be closely related to a well known open problem relating communication complexity and rank. We then take modest steps towards extending our results to general, commutative algebraic computation, and prove exponential lower bounds for monotone algebraic circuit size, as well as for the size of certain types of constant depth algebraic circuits.

Reference-contexts: Kantor's lemma (see <ref> [1] </ref>, chapter 6) states that this matrix has full rank. 2 We thus get: Theorem 7 If a circuit of size s and degree D computes d then s (n=(D 2 d)) (d) . If a homogeneous circuit of size s computes d then s (n=d 3 ) (d) .

Reference-contexts: In boolean complexity theory the line of attack taken by the community is to prove lower bounds for restricted circuits. Specifically, exponential lower bounds are known for constant depth circuits and for monotone circuits (see <ref> [2] </ref> for a survey). Similarly, restricted algebraic circuits may be considered. Strassen [11] shows that restricting the circuits not to use division gates does not change (by more than a polynomial factor) the complexity of computing any multivariate polynomial.

Reference-contexts: To date, the best lower bound known for the size of algebraic circuits computing any (explicit, polynomial degree) function is (n log n). The only lower bound known for algebraic circuit depth is the trivial (log n). (See, e.g. <ref> [3] </ref> for a survey) This situation is very similar to the situation in boolean complexity theory where essentially no nontrivial lower bounds are known. In boolean complexity theory the line of attack taken by the community is to prove lower bounds for restricted circuits.

Reference-contexts: For the case of bilinear forms, Winograd [15] shows that restricting the circuits not to rely on commutativity at most doubles the complexity. Indeed, all of the work on matrix multiplication (which is a bilinear form) is implicitly done using only non-commutative circuits. Hyafil <ref> [4] </ref> considers the computation of the determinant, and proves that non-commutative circuits that compute the determinant require exponential size. Unfortunately, Hyafil's proof is incorrect 1 . <p> There are also some questions about the non-commutative model: Page 8 * Is D (f) = O (log F (f ))? * Prove a lower bound for non-commutative circuit size. (perhaps, as <ref> [4] </ref> attempted, for the determinant function.) * Separate F (f) from B (f), or even D (f ) from log B (f).

Valiant et al [10] prove that this transformation can be done while keeping the size polynomial as well.

Reference-contexts: It is known that for any function b, C (b) log 2 r (b). Lovasz and Saks (see <ref> [7] </ref>) ask whether log r and C are polynomially related, i.e. whether C (b) = (log r (b)) O (1) . We show that this problem is intimately related to questions regarding the power of negation in non-commutative computation. <p> Lovasz and Saks (see <ref> [7] </ref>) asked whether C (b) = (log rank (b)) O (1) for every boolean function b. It is known ([16], see also [7]) that the answer to this question is positive if and only if log (rank + (M )) = log (rank (M )) O (1) for every real matrix <p> Lovasz and Saks (see <ref> [7] </ref>) asked whether C (b) = (log rank (b)) O (1) for every boolean function b. It is known ([16], see also [7]) that the answer to this question is positive if and only if log (rank + (M )) = log (rank (M )) O (1) for every real matrix M with 0-1 entries. Define an algebraic function to be simple if all of its coefficients are zero or one.
