Reference-contexts: Therefore G I = (V; E) is a directed acyclic graph, and the single-source shortest paths problem and thus the graph reachability problem can be solved in O (jV j+jEj) time <ref> [CLR91] </ref>. If we adopt the trivial partition, we have jEj chains, and the length l i equals one for each chain. This gives us jS calP fi Q l i )= 2 jPj+jEj vertices, and at most 2 2 (jPj+jEj) arcs.

Reference-contexts: For temporal projection, the planner does not have full control over the events. Instead, the reasoner need to achieve the goal under the restrictions that (1) the number of events is fixed, and (2) the event ordering must be consistent with the inherent ordering constraints. Dean and Boddy <ref> [DB88] </ref> study a variant of temporal projection. Their investigation focuses on the 4 numbers of preconditions and postconditions in causal rules, and the number of causal rules associated with events. <p> They show that temporal projection is NP-Complete even if we severely restrict the forms of causal rules and the numbers of rules associated with events. Nebel and Backstrom [NB92] prove the NP-Completeness of a special case of temporal projection, which is previously conjectured to be tractable in <ref> [DB88] </ref>. For this special case, the corresponding planning problem turns out to be solvable in polynomial time [NB92]. <p> It indicates that ordering constraints play an important role in the computation complexity.

Given a directed graph with a set of forbidden pairs of arcs, the forbidden pairs of arcs problem <ref> [GJ79] </ref> determines whether there is a path between two nodes without using both arcs in any forbidden pair of arcs.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, temporal projection is viewed as search. To expedite search, we develop a localized-reasoning algorithm to exploit structure in problem instances. The use of event-based localized reasoning in planning has been advocated by Lansky in GEM <ref> [Lan88] </ref>. Localized reasoning exploit locality to improve performance. In GEM, locality regarding domain behavior is modeled by "regions". "Regions" in GEM are composed of sets of interrelated events whose behaviors are delimited by event-based temporal logic constraints.

Reference-contexts: By associating multiple rules with an event, we can model the conditional effects of the events. In this way, each event determines a state-transition relation on the state space determined by P <ref> [LD93] </ref>. The ordering of the events is uncertain. The possible event sequences are determined by a given set of ordering constraints on the events. Generally, many event orderings are possible, each of which may result in a different evolution of the system. <p> It indicates that ordering constraints play an important role in the computation complexity.

We have been trying to understand why temporal projection are so difficult and what, if any, structure might be extracted from such problems to expedite decision making and inference [LD93]. We find that the size of the state space is also an important factor of complexity. We depict the complexity trade-offs involving (1) the ordering constraints on events, (2) the size of the state space, and (3) the number of causal rules associated with individual events. <p> In the remainder of this paper, we adopt Definition 9 for the PRJ task as the standard form of all the reasoning tasks considered through out this paper. 2 PRJ1 is a variant of the temporal projection problem which is considered by Lin and Dean in <ref> [LD93] </ref>. 3 PRJ2 is a variant of the temporal projection problem which is considered by Dean and Boddy in [DB88] and Nebel and Backstrom in [NB92]. 4 The proofs for all the theorems stated in this paper are provided in Appendix A at the end of this document. 15 3.2 Temporal

For this special case, the corresponding planning problem turns out to be solvable in polynomial time [NB92]. This happens because in the corresponding planning problem, the planner is free to select an arbitrary set of event instances from a fixed set of event types with no ordering constraints on events, while in temporal projection, the reasoner does not have full control over events and their ordering. <p> It indicates that ordering constraints play an important role in the computation complexity.

A subset of events may always occur as an atomic unit; all the other events either occur before or after the subset of 6 Nebel and Backstrom <ref> [NB92] </ref> proves the NP-Completeness of a special case of the temporal projection problem, which is adapted here to prove Theorem 5. 20 events. Similarly, several atomic units may always occur as an atomic unit. In this way, temporal locality can be introduced at many levels.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we examine the event sequence to determine whether it is consistent with the ordering constraints. Since bipartite match problem can be solved in polynomial time <ref> [PS82] </ref>, we can solve this special case of temporal projection problem in polynomial time.
