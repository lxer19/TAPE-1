Abstract: This paper reports on our experience hand tagging the senses of 25 of the most frequent verbs in 12,925 sentences of the Wall Street Journal Treebank corpus (Marcus et al. 1993). The verbs are tagged with respect to senses in WordNet (Miller 1990). Some of the annotated verbs can function as both main and auxiliary verbs, and some are often used in idioms. This paper suggests consistently representing these as separate subclasses. Strategies described in the coding instruction for recognizing idioms are described, as well as some challenging ambiguities found in the data.

Reference-contexts: In related work, we have begun to tag nouns and adjectives as well. These are being chosen additionally on the basis of co-occurrence with the verbs already tagged, to support approaches such as <ref> (Hirst 1987) </ref>, in which word-sense ambiguities are resolved with respect to one another. Some of the chosen verbs can function as both main and auxiliary verbs, and some are often used in idioms. In this paper, we suggest consistently representing these as separate subclasses.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper reports on our experience hand tagging the senses of 25 of the most frequent verbs in 12,925 sentences of the Wall Street Journal Treebank corpus <ref> (Marcus et al. 1993) </ref>. The purpose of this work is to support related work in automatic word-sense disambiguation.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of this work is to support related work in automatic word-sense disambiguation. The verbs are tagged with respect to senses in WordNet <ref> (Miller 1990) </ref>, which has become widely used, for example in corpus-annotation projects (Miller et al. 1994, Ng & Hian 1996, and Grish-man et al. 1994) and for performing disambiguation (Resnik 1995 and Leacock et al. 1993).

Reference-contexts: Finally, it is helpful to the human tagger for the preprocessor to target these distinguished classes, for which relatively high-accuracy automatic solutions are possible. 3.1 Auxiliary Verbs WordNet does not provide sense information for auxiliary uses of verbs. SEMCOR <ref> (Miller et al. 1994) </ref> leaves these uses untagged.

Reference-contexts: The verbs are tagged with respect to senses in WordNet (Miller 1990), which has become widely used, for example in corpus-annotation projects (Miller et al. 1994, Ng & Hian 1996, and Grish-man et al. 1994) and for performing disambiguation <ref> (Resnik 1995 and Leacock et al. 1993) </ref>. The verbs to tag were chosen on the basis of how frequently they occur in the text, how wide their range of senses, and how distinguishable the senses are from one another.

Reference-contexts: WordNet does not provide entries for all idioms, and the entries it does provide do not always include a sense for the occurrences observed in the corpus. It is important to recognize idioms, because interpreting their constituent words separately would often change the meaning of the sentence <ref> (cf., e.g., Wilks 1977 and Wilensky & Arens 1980) </ref>. Our cod-ing instructions specify that the tagger should attempt to identify idioms even if WordNet does not provide an entry for it. The preprocessor assists in this task, by identifying potential idioms.
