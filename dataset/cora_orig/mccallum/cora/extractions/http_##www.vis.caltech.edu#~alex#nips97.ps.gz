Abstract: A model of motion detection is presented. The model contains three stages. The first stage is unoriented and is selective for contrast polarities. The next two stages work in parallel. A phase insensitive stage pools across different contrast polarities through a spatiotemporal filter and thus can detect first and second order motion. A phase sensitive stage keeps contrast polarities separate, each of which is filtered through a spatiotemporal filter, and thus only first order motion can be detected. Differential phase sensitivity can therefore account for the detection of first and second order motion. Phase insensitive detectors correspond to cortical complex cells, and phase sensitive detectors to simple cells.

Reference-contexts: Hence at least some complex cell responses need to be built up directly from LGN responses. Several lines of evidence from cat physiology support this suggestion. First, the mean latencies of simple and complex cells are about equal <ref> (Bullier & Henry, 1979) </ref>, suggesting that at least some complex cells receive direct LGN input. Second, noise stimuli can selectively activate complex cells, without activation of simple cells (Hammond, 1991). Third, cross-correlation analyses show that complex cells do receive simple cell input (Ghose et al., 1994).

Reference-contexts: Second, noise stimuli can selectively activate complex cells, without activation of simple cells (Hammond, 1991). Third, cross-correlation analyses show that complex cells do receive simple cell input <ref> (Ghose et al., 1994) </ref>. The present model predicts that some cortical complex cells should respond to second order motion. Zhou & Baker (1993) investigated this, and found that some complex cells in area 17 respond to second order motion.

Reference-contexts: Curiously, all motion models essentially ignore the concentric opponency of receptive fields in the LGN. This is usually justified by pointing to the linearity of simple cells with respect to stimulus parameters. However, it has been shown that simple cells in fact exhibit strong nonlinearities <ref> (Hammond & MacKay, 1983) </ref>. Moreover, motion detection does require at least one stage of nonlinearity (Poggio & Reichardt, 1973).

Reference-contexts: It is only at the cortex that direction and orientation selectivity arise. Cortical simple cells are sensitive to the phase of the stimulus, while complex cells are not <ref> (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962) </ref>. Most motion models take at least partial inspiration from known physiology and anatomy, by relating the kernels of the motion detectors to the physiology of cortical cells. The motion energy model in particular detects orientation and first order motion at the same time.

Moreover, motion detection does require at least one stage of nonlinearity <ref> (Poggio & Reichardt, 1973) </ref>. The present study develops a model of first and second order motion detection which explicitly includes an unoriented processing stage, and phase sensitive and phase insensitive motion detectors are built from these unoriented signals.

Reference-contexts: If second order motion is defined by contrast reversals, then detecting contrast edges and then rectifying the resulting signal of contrast will yield a first order motion signal. Thus this approach includes three steps: orientation detection, rectification and finally motion detection <ref> (Wilson et al., 1992) </ref>. 1.2 Visual physiology Cells in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) have concentric (and hence unoriented) receptive fields which are organized in an opponent manner.
