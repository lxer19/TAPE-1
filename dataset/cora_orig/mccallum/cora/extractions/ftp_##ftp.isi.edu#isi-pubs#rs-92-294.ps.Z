Reference-contexts: This is the major focus of our work in the Multimedia Conferencing Project at ISI. Toward this end, ISI and BBN have developed an experimental packet teleconferencing system that currently is operating at several sites on the Terrestrial Wideband Network, TWBnet <ref> [1] </ref>, and has more recently been ported to the DARPA Research Testbed, DARTnet, for further experimentation. The system allows geographically separated individuals to collaborate by combining real-time packet audio and video with shared computer workspaces, sometimes called groupware.

Reference-contexts: By separating the connection manager from the user interface, conference-oriented tools avoid duplication of effort; this encompasses management of participation, authentication, and presentation of coordinated UIs. This is along the lines of Swinehart's switching kernel <ref> [5] </ref> and is related to Lantz' and Lauwers' models for UIs that endow programs with the ability to be multi-user [6].

Reference-contexts: This is along the lines of Swinehart's switching kernel [5] and is related to Lantz' and Lauwers' models for UIs that endow programs with the ability to be multi-user <ref> [6] </ref>. The connection manager is also separate from underlying components, called media agents, which handle communication protocol decisions (transport and internetwork protocols) and the devices specific to each type of shared media (audio, video, groupware).

Reference-contexts: It is based on the protocol used by the Multimedia Conference Control Program (MMCC), which has served as both user interface and connection manager for the existing system <ref> [11] </ref>. The CCP is essentially a multicast, transaction-based protocol. It aims to provide reliable, group communication and to accommodate variability in request-reply response time due to WAN operation and to heterogeneous end system configurations. The specification for CCP has been drafted [12] and implementation is underway.

It aims to provide reliable, group communication and to accommodate variability in request-reply response time due to WAN operation and to heterogeneous end system configurations. The specification for CCP has been drafted <ref> [12] </ref> and implementation is underway. Conference orchestration is achieved through use of a distributed, peer-to-peer model. Peer connection managers reside on machines scattered throughout the Internet.

Reference-contexts: Connection Control Configuration Control Resource Synthesizer (Routing) Distributed Locator Service Connection Manager Dynamic Configuration Management of Shared Resources In those instances where capabilities at end systems mismatch entirely (i.e., no compromise configuration can be found), a resource synthesizer will synthesize solutions to configuration requests <ref> [13] </ref>. The resource -3 synthesizer must find a sequence of communication mechanisms and intermediate translators to construct paths among all the end systems in the connection. The resource synthesizer would draw information from the locator service about shared capabilities that could be used throughout the network.
