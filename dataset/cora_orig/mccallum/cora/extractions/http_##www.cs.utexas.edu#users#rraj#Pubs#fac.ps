Title: Analysis of a Local Search Heuristic for Facility Location Problems  
Author: Madhukar R. Korupolu C. Greg Plaxton Rajmohan Rajaraman 
Abstract: In this paper, we study approximation algorithms for several NP-hard facility location problems. We prove that a simple local search heuristic yields polynomial-time constant-factor approximation bounds for the metric versions of the uncapacitated k-median problem and the uncapacitated facility location problem. (For the k-median problem, our algorithms require a constant-factor blowup in the parameter k.) This local search heuristic was first proposed several decades ago, and has been shown to exhibit good practical performance in empirical studies. We also extend the above results to obtain constant-factor approximation bounds for the metric versions of capacitated k-median and facility location problems.

Thus, any solution for the capacitated variants with splittable demands can be completely characterized by the set S of open facilites. For the capacitated problems with unsplittable demands, however, it is NP-hard to compute an optimal assignment associated with a given set S of open facilites.
