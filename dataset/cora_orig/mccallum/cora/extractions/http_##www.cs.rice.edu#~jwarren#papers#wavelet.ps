Abstract: In this paper, we present a new class of wavelets, based on subdivision surfaces, that radically extends the class of representable functions. Whereas previous two-dimensional methods were restricted to functions defined on IR 2 , the subdivision wavelets developed here may be applied to functions defined on compact surfaces of arbitrary topological type. We envision many applications of this work, including continuous level-of-detail control for graphics rendering, compression of geometric models, and acceleration of global illumination algorithms. Level-of-detail control for spherical domains is illustrated using two examples: shape approximation of a polyhedral model, and color approximation of global terrain data.

Reference-contexts: As a corollary to Theorem 1, if the subdivision scheme generates continuous surfaces, the scaling functions j i are continuous, hence they are also integrable <ref> [1] </ref>. We may now establish the refinability of the scaling functions defined in Theorem 1. Theorem 2 The scaling functions j i (x) are refinable.

Reference-contexts: Multiresolution analysis is widely used for data compression applications. Mallat [29] and DeVore et al. [11], among others, use wavelet techniques for efficient image compression. Finkelstein and Salesin [16] develop a wavelet-based method for approximating B-spline curves within an L 1 tolerance.

Reference-contexts: Additional details of implementation and an expanded treatment of applications are discussed in a related PhD thesis [27]. The construction of subdivision wavelets described herein applies directly to a variety of already existing subdivision schemes. These include piecewise linear subdivision (which produces polyhedra); the schemes of Catmull & Clark <ref> [3, 20] </ref>, Loop [26] or Dyn et al. [14] (which produce tangent-plane-smooth G 1 subdivision surfaces); and the modifications by Hoppe et al. [23, 22] that produce piecewise smooth surfaces with selected discontinuities. <p> Subdivision schemes can be further categorized as being either primal or dual. A subdivision scheme is primal if the faces of the mesh are split into subfaces by the refinement procedure. Catmull-Clark subdivision <ref> [3, 20] </ref> is a primal scheme based on subdivision of quadrilateral faces. Polyhedral subdivision, the butterfly scheme of Dyn, Gregory, and Levin [14] and Loop's method [26] are primal schemes based on subdivision of triangular faces. <p> In this paper, we have established a theoretical basis for applying multiresolution analysis to surfaces of arbitrary topological type. These results hold for any local, uniformly convergent, continuous, primal subdivision scheme, including polyhedral subdivision, the butterfly scheme [14], Loop's schem [26], and Catmull-Clark surfaces <ref> [3] </ref>. The results also hold for piecewise smooth subdivision as described in Hoppe et al. [23, 22], and for open surfaces possessing holes or boundary curves. There are numerous areas for future work: * Weighted Inner Product.

Reference-contexts: We are now in a position to construct wavelets, that is, a set of functions j (x) = ( j j 2 (x); :::) that span the orthogonal complement space W j (M 0 ). (The elements of j (x) are not mutually orthogonal. Some authors, including Chui <ref> [4] </ref>, refer to such functions as pre-wavelets.) It is of significant practical importance that the decomposition and reconstruction filters associated with these wavelets are constructed and applied in linear time. This practical concern drives much of the development in this section. 17 6.1 The Construction. <p> In order to apply these operations in linear time, we must build wavelets that are locally supported. Constructing wavelets of local support is a common problem in the wavelet literature and has been handled in various ways. Chui <ref> [4] </ref> is able to develop unique locally supported wavelets for B-spline curves. Mallat [29] builds wavelets that, in addition to being orthogonal to the scaling functions, are mutually orthogonal. Unlike Chui, Mallat's conditions do not allow the construction of locally supported wavelets.

Reference-contexts: Instead, one may construct them to span a space V j fl that is some (nonorthog-onal) complement of V j (M 0 ) in V j+1 (M 0 ). This choice is similar to the one in Dahmen et al. <ref> [6] </ref> in which orthogonality is sacrificed in order to achieve sparse filter banks. Our approach, which works well in practice, improves on Mallat's approach of merely truncat ing coefficients. Instead, we build functions in V j fl that are the least-squares projections of i (x) into W j .

Reference-contexts: The L 1 norm for the synthesis filters P j arising from piecewise linear subdivision is simply 1 for every level, and is therefore not shown in a table.

Reference-contexts: This is relatively easy for some schemes, such as Loop's, that converge to polynomials in regular regions, but it is harder for schemes such as the butterfly method that are nowhere polynomial. A general method for integration in regular regions was recently developed by Dahmen and Micchelli <ref> [8] </ref>. It operates by reducing the problem of computing inner products to one of computing eigenvectors of a matrix defined by the refinement equations.

Reference-contexts: Impressive "lossy" compression rates for images have been achieved using this type of approximation [11]. Two-dimensional wavelets are important for a variety of applications including image compression. They are generally constructed by forming tensor products of univariate wavelets <ref> [9] </ref>, in much the same way that tensor product B-spline surfaces are formed by products of univariate B-splines. Unfortunately, tensor-product constructions require that the functions to be decomposed be defined on IR 2 or on a periodic version of IR 2 , such as the cylinder or torus. <p> Unfortunately, tensor-product constructions require that the functions to be decomposed be defined on IR 2 or on a periodic version of IR 2 , such as the cylinder or torus. There also exist nontensor-product constructions for wavelets on IR 2 <ref> [9, 25] </ref>, but none of these methods are applicable to functions defined on more general topological domains, such as spheres. <p> In one respect, this is a generalization of the approach taken by Daubechies <ref> [9] </ref>, whose locally supported orthogonal scaling functions are also defined through a recursive subdivision procedure. Although in general the j+1 (x) are not simple dilates of the j (x), one can nonetheless use them to define a sequence of nested spaces. 4.1 Subdivision Surfaces.

Reference-contexts: Although one can certainly construct fractal-like subdivision schemes that do not converge to well defined surfaces, in this paper we shall consider only local schemes that uni formly converge to a surface no matter where the control vertices are placed (see DeRose et al. <ref> [10] </ref> for a discussion of conditions under which a scheme is uniformly convergent). In the remainder of the paper, subdivision schemes will be assumed to be local and uniformly convergent.

Reference-contexts: For many of the functions encountered in practice, a large percentage of the wavelet coefficients are small, meaning that good approximations can be obtained by using only a few of the largest coefficients.

Unfortunately, the analysis filters derived from Equation 17 need not be sparse. For interpolating subdivision schemes such as polyhedral subdivision and the G 1 "butterfly" scheme of Dyn et al. <ref> [14] </ref>, the situation is much improved. Such interpolating schemes have the property that O j is the identity matrix. <p> In this paper, we have established a theoretical basis for applying multiresolution analysis to surfaces of arbitrary topological type.

Reference-contexts: L 1 reconstruction begins with the complete, unreduced reconstruction, and attempts to remove successive wavelet coefficients until no more are possible. L 1 wavelet compression of complex surfaces is further studied in Eck et al. <ref> [15] </ref>. * Location. In some applications, it may be useful to compress only a portion of a model while the rest of it is outside the user's view. <p> Reconstruction of the approximation is done by adding back to the base surface the scaled wavelet associated with each selected coefficient. Details of the reconstruction phase are given explicitly in Lounsbery [27], and are discussed by Eck et al. <ref> [15] </ref> for the case of polyhedra. The effect of reconstruction is to produce vertices on the approximation surface that represent the addition of the selected wavelets to the base surface. However, this form is not appropriate for many applications that require an actual surface representation. <p> For other purposes, including multireso-lution compression of an arbitrary mesh, an initial preprocessing step is required to convert the input into an approximation with the necessary connectivity. Such a conversion algorithm is presented in Eck et al. <ref> [15] </ref> for the general case. The examples presented in this paper were converted with an algorithm written for the special case of converting input taken in cylindrical sections into points on a subdivided octahedron. 7.5 Polyhedral Examples. <p> Such remeshing creates a close match between the inner product weights and the actual sizes of the triangles. This is the approach taken by Eck et al. <ref> [15] </ref>. * Linear Time Sparse Matrix Inversion. As explained in Section 6.4, linear-time reconstruction for general subdivision rules depends upon linear-time solution of general sparse linear systems.

Reference-contexts: Hierarchical B-splines, as introduced by Forsey and Bartels <ref> [17] </ref>, provide a powerful mechanism for editing shapes at various levels of detail. However, hierarchical B-splines can only represent a restricted class of surface topologies. The methods described here provide an alternative to hierarchical B-splines, and are capable of representing smooth multiresolution surfaces of arbitrary topological type.

One way to compute inner products is to follow the approach in Halstead et al. <ref> [20] </ref>. Their approach for computing integrals over subdivision surfaces was to observe that away from extraordinary points, integrals could be computed exactly since Catmull-Clark subdivision converges to uniform bicubic B-splines in regular regions (those regions removed from extraordinary points).

Additional details of implementation and an expanded treatment of applications are discussed in a related PhD thesis <ref> [27] </ref>. The construction of subdivision wavelets described herein applies directly to a variety of already existing subdivision schemes. <p> Reconstruction of the approximation is done by adding back to the base surface the scaled wavelet associated with each selected coefficient. Details of the reconstruction phase are given explicitly in Lounsbery <ref> [27] </ref>, and are discussed by Eck et al. [15] for the case of polyhedra. The effect of reconstruction is to produce vertices on the approximation surface that represent the addition of the selected wavelets to the base surface.

Reference-contexts: Multiresolution analysis is widely used for data compression applications. Mallat [29] and DeVore et al. [11], among others, use wavelet techniques for efficient image compression. Finkelstein and Salesin [16] develop a wavelet-based method for approximating B-spline curves within an L 1 tolerance. Other examples of wavelet-based compression techniques abound <ref> [5, 28, 30, 2] </ref>. Using wavelet techniques, lossy compression of a function is typically implemented with a three-stage algorithm: 1. Filter bank decomposition.

Reference-contexts: Multiresolution analysis as formulated by Mallat <ref> [29] </ref> provides a convenient framework by which to develop the analysis and synthesis filters. <p> Constructing wavelets of local support is a common problem in the wavelet literature and has been handled in various ways. Chui [4] is able to develop unique locally supported wavelets for B-spline curves. Mallat <ref> [29] </ref> builds wavelets that, in addition to being orthogonal to the scaling functions, are mutually orthogonal. Unlike Chui, Mallat's conditions do not allow the construction of locally supported wavelets. Instead, in practice Mallat approximates his wavelets with locally supported truncations that are not strictly orthogonal to their scaling functions. <p> Dahmen [7] also gives a similar, but more detailed analysis of the stability of multires-olution schemes over irregular grids. 7 Wavelet Compression of Surfaces.

Reference-contexts: Note, however, that even if locally supported wavelets can be shown to exist, their analysis filters will still be global. Thus, an analogue of the Quak-Weyrich trick for linear time decomposition <ref> [34] </ref> would also need to be developed for a linear time filter bank. * Preventing Self-Intersection. Because reconstructed approximations may self-intersect, the basic compression technique does not guarantee preservation of the original topology in the ambient space.
