Title: Reusing Force Deployment Plans  
Author: Alice M. Mulvehill 
Address: Bedford, MA USA  
Affiliation: The MITRE Corporation  
Abstract: This paper describes how the prototype system ForMAT (Force Management and Analysis Tool) combines CBR and knowledge acquisition/engineering techniques to acquire knowledge of how military forces are deployed; and to support the creation, development, management, reuse, and modification of force deployment plans. Modification challenges are identified.

Reference-contexts: The United States Transportation Command (US-TRANSCOM) is responsible for determining the transportation capability for all types of missions. For large and very large missions the process by which transportation plans are constructed can be very complex and time consuming <ref> (Coley et al. 1991) </ref>. Plans built to satisfy "anticipated" (or likely) situations are called deliberate plans.

Reference-contexts: ForMAT employs case based reasoning (CBR) techniques to store, index, and retrieve FMs; and knowledge acquisition/engineering techniques to facilitate classification and to monitor how the system is being used <ref> (Cross et al. 1994) </ref>. ForMAT can interact with other PI systems that focus on: the more general operations planning (TARGET); the more detailed equipment and supply support requirements (i.e., LOGGEN); and the temporal aspects of the plan (i.e., TPEDIT) (Walker & Cross 1994). <p> ForMAT can interact with other PI systems that focus on: the more general operations planning (TARGET); the more detailed equipment and supply support requirements (i.e., LOGGEN); and the temporal aspects of the plan (i.e., TPEDIT) <ref> (Walker & Cross 1994) </ref>. Within ForMAT, a FM is represented as a case within a case base. Through ForMAT the user can create, view, retrieve, modify, and manage FMs; as well as import and export the TPFDD to/from other systems.

Reference-contexts: In the early phases of deployment plan development, combat forces and support units may be specified generically (e.g., fighter aircraft), as can movement times (i.e., latest departure, earliest departure, latest arrival, earliest arrival), origins and destinations <ref> (Kahn & Mulvehill 1995) </ref>. As the deployment plan matures, each specification for a generic requirement is replaced by information associated with the actual unit (s) or equipment that will be used.
