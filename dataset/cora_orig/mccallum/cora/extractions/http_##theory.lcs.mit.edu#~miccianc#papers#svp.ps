Title: The Shortest Vector in a Lattice is Hard to Approximate to within Some Constant.  
Author: Daniele Micciancio

Affiliation: MIT Laboratory for Computer Science  
Abstract: We show that computing the approximate length of the shortest vector in a lattice within a factor c is NP-hard for randomized reduc tions for any constant c &lt; p 2. We also give a deterministic reduction based on a number theoretic conjecture.

Reference-contexts: Despite the similarities between the two problems, progress in proving the hardness of SVP has been much slower. fl email: miccianc@theory.lcs.mit.edu. 1 Even for the exact version of this problem, proving the conjectured NP--hardness remained an open problem for a long time. Finally, Ajtai <ref> [2] </ref> proved that the SVP is NP-hard for randomized reductions.

Lemma 5 For all ff 1 ; ff 2 &gt; 0, there exists ffi 1 ; ffi 2 ; ffi 3 2 (0; 1) so that for all sufficiently large n the following holds.
