Reference-contexts: The modeling of the combustion process in the boiler involves the solution of a large computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem derived from the boiler geometry, operating parameters, and specified boundary conditions. Currently, the commercial CFD code Phoenics <ref> [1] </ref> is used to compute the steady-state combustion solutions. The fluid flow solutions and temperature distributions obtained from the solution of the CFD models are used as the input for modeling the chemical reactions involving the injector systems [6].

Reference-contexts: The Information Wide Area Year (I-WAY) <ref> [2] </ref> and Global Information Infrastruc 2 ture (GII) testbed deployed at the Supercomputing 95 (SC95) conference provided an excellent opportunity to study the utility of such a remote engineering tool. <p> This year at SC95 an experimental high-performance network called the I-WAY <ref> [2] </ref> was built linking supercomputing resources around the country with Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) speed. This environment represented an ideal testbed for examining the utility and performance of the remote collaborative tool described in this paper.

Reference-contexts: The communication layer between the visualization environment and the numerical simulation is provided by the CAVEcomm message-passing libraries developed at Argonne National Laboratory. The visualization environment is based on the CAVE technology developed at the Electronics Visualization Laboratory (EVL) at the University of Illinois at Chicago <ref> [3] </ref>. Users are immersed in the virtual environment by stepping into a ten foot cube that has stereo images projected onto two walls and the floor. Several users may be simultaneously immersed in the same virtual environment and interact with the same computational model.

Reference-contexts: This calculation is separate from the visualization process and numerical results are communicated to the virtual boiler using the CAVEcomm message-passing library developed at Ar-gonne National Laboratory <ref> [4] </ref>. The virtual boiler environment consists of several components designed to aide in the efficient optimization of the injection system. In this paper we discuss the software that allows rapid virtual boiler construction, various mechanisms for data visualization, and a package for the interactive placement of injector nozzles. <p> In addition, this communication layer needs to be portable so that the numerical calculations can be performed on a variety of architectures ranging from Sun workstations to the IBM SP. The CAVEcomm library <ref> [4] </ref> developed at Argonne National Laboratory provides the performance aspects needed from the software perspective, and we use this standard as our message-passing interface. Since we are sending a large amount of scientific data from the numerical model to the visualization environment, we require high speed networking links.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the particle tracking model used to model the sprays from the injectors can be improved in several ways. For instance, we can increase the resolution and hence numerical accuracy around the nozzle by incorporating unstructured mesh 20 techniques such as those developed in the SUMAA3d <ref> [5] </ref> project. We can also im-prove the statistical accuracy of the model by using parallel processing to increase the number of droplet trajectories sampled and by incorporating a more realistic droplet evaporation model.

Reference-contexts: Currently, the commercial CFD code Phoenics [1] is used to compute the steady-state combustion solutions. The fluid flow solutions and temperature distributions obtained from the solution of the CFD models are used as the input for modeling the chemical reactions involving the injector systems <ref> [6] </ref>. The results of the chemical kinetics model for each injector configuration gives the predicted effectiveness of the pollution control system. Finding the optimal configuration of the injection system is an iterative process in which the only parameters that can be adjusted are nozzle location and specific spray configuration.
