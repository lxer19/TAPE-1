Title: Navigational Plans For Data Integration  
Author: Marc Friedman, Alon Levy, Todd Millstein 
Address: Washington  
Affiliation: University of  
Abstract: We consider the problem of building data integration systems when the data sources are webs of data, rather than sets of relations. Previous approaches to modeling data sources are inappropriate in this context because they do not capture the relationships between linked data and the need to navigate through paths in the data source in order to obtain the data. We first describe a language for modeling data sources in this new context. We show that our language has the required expressive power, and that minor extensions to it would cause significant computational cost in answering queries. We provide a sound and complete algorithm for reformulating a user query into a query over the data sources, and we show how to create query execution plans that both query and navigate the data sources.

Reference-contexts: The data complexity reduces to the polynomial problem of applying a datalog program to a set of facts. <ref> (Abiteboul & Duschka 1998) </ref> show that the data complexity of answering a query becomes co-NP-hard if the query contains atoms of the form X 6= Y and when the query contains constants.

Reference-contexts: The Complexity of GLAV In this section we show that GLAV reaches the limits of the tradeoff between expressive power and tractability of query answering in data integration systems. Although languages based on description logics that have been proposed for data integration are more powerful than GLAV <ref> (Calvanese, Giacomo, & Lenzerini 1998) </ref>, none has been shown to be tractable. Two measures of complexity are used for query processing problems: query complexity and data complexity. The query complexity measures the query answering time in terms of the size of the query Q, holding the other inputs fixed. <p> For future work, we are considering the extension of our query answering algorithm (and the associated complexity results) when additional constraints are stated on the mediated schema using description logics, using techniques described in <ref> (Calvanese, Giacomo, & Lenz-erini 1998) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These properties render previous formalisms inappropriate for incorporating data webs as sources in a data integration system. Previous works that considered such sources (e.g., the ARIADNE System <ref> (Knoblock et al. 1998) </ref>) modeled each page as a separate data source, and assumed each page was an entry point.

Reference-contexts: The local-as-view (LAV) approach (Levy, Rajaraman, & Ordille 1996; Friedman & Weld 1997; Duschka & Genesereth 1997) is the opposite: the source relations are defined as expressions over the relations in the mediated schema (see <ref> (Ullman 1997) </ref> for a comparison of the approaches). As the WWW expands and sites become more complex, a growing number of sources can no longer be modeled as sets of relations, but rather as webs of data with a set of entry points.
