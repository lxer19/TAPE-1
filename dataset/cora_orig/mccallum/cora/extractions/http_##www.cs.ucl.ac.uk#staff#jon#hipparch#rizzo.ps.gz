Abstract: The ability to control quickly the expansion/reduction of the multicast distribution tree is central in some recent proposals for multicast congestion control. At the lowest level, these operations are controlled by the IGMP protocol. With the current specification of the protocol, IGMP takes a few seconds to stop distribution of a group after a request. This reduces the effectiveness of congestion control mechanisms based on this feature. In this paper we propose a mechanism to make the LEAVE operation act instantaneously, basing on prediction techniques similar to those used in processors for optimizing jump performance. The proposed mechanisms acts on the router side only, and it is fully compatible with the existing IGMP protocol. An implementation of the mechanisms described in this paper has been included in the latest mrouted3.9 sources and is available from the author.

Reference-contexts: For efficiency and scalability reasons, low level multicast routing protocols <ref> [1] </ref> do not keep exact group membership information. As a consequence, even when the last receiver exits a group, a router can only stop traffic forwarding to an interface after a polling phase to determine group membership has timed out without replies. <p> This permits to forward multicast traffic only where necessary, and to avoid flooding network segments where there are no receivers interested to a given group. Group membership information between hosts and routers on local networks is exchanged by means of the IGMP protocol <ref> [1] </ref>. Hosts willing to receive traffic directed to a multicast group send a membership REPORT message, that the router uses to enable forwarding of the requested group to the local network segment.

Reference-contexts: Since multicast data is not forwarded reliably by the network, such losses are not too worrisome, provided they are rare: either the application can tolerate them <ref> [3] </ref>, or some higher level mechanism will exist to implement repair actions [2,6].

Reference-contexts: The leave message immediately triggers a membership poll (called last receiver poll), whose outcome determines whether or not to keep forwarding data for that group. This mechanism is used by layered congestion control mechanisms such as RLM <ref> [4] </ref> and RLC [7] to achieve scalable congestion control with rate adaptation to the different parts of the multicast distribution tree. Because of the feedback suppression mechanism (but also because IGMP messages are not sent reliably), routers do not have exact group membership information.

Reference-contexts: We have then built a small test setup comprising two networks connected by mrouters through a tunnel. RLC instances have been run on the two local networks, and bandwidth limitations have been enforced on various parts of the network using the dummynet software <ref> [5] </ref> developed by the author. Preliminary experience with this setting has also shown a behaviour conforming to our expectations.

But such large time constants slow down the responsivity of the congestion control mechanism, and reduce its effectiveness.
