Abstract: Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing is indispensable to real-time applications in integrated services packet-switching networks. However, existing QoS-routing schemes based on either request flooding or link-state dissemination are inefficient in terms of message overhead and/or operational cost. This paper proposes a QoS-routing algorithm with bounded flooding which not only dramatically reduces message overhead and operational cost, but also provides good performance. The overhead is reduced by limiting the search area only within which connection-request messages are flooded. Since our scheme is based on flooding, it does not require path calculation nor link-state dissemination, which can be very expensive. In order to limit the search area, we employ a distance table at each node which stores hop counts of the minimum-hop paths to all the nodes reachable via its outgoing links. Unlike link-state routing, the proposed scheme only needs network-topology information that changes much less frequently than link-load states. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of performance, operational cost and message overhead. Especially, it is shown to be much better than all the other existing QoS-routing schemes in terms of message overhead and operational cost, while providing reasonably good performance.

Reference-contexts: QoS routing must therefore be considered as a component of Integrated Service Model in the ISPN <ref> [11] </ref>. In addition to finding a qualified route for each requested connection, QoS-routing must be able to make good overall network utilization. This also relates to increasing the chance of accepting future requests by 1 making a good route selection for the current request.

Reference-contexts: The information distributed is often called link-state, and thus, source-directed routing is also called link-state routing. By applying either Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm or Bellman-Ford shortest-path algorithm based on link-state information, one can find a qualified route for the requested connection. The ATM Forum's PNNI standard <ref> [12] </ref> defines a routing protocol for distributing link-state throughout the network, and a signaling protocol for processing and forwarding connection requests from the source. A QoS extension to the OSPF protocol was proposed for the Internet, including an explicit routing mechanism for source-directed IP routing [13, 14]. <p> Because of its high operational overhead in distributing and maintaining link-state information, source-directed routing may not scale well. To improve the scalability in large networks, a hierarchical approach can be adopted to distribute and manage link-state information <ref> [12] </ref>. In addition to use of a hierarchical approach, efforts have been made to reduce link-state messages in order to control the overhead. Periodic or triggered distribution of link-state information is a typical example of this effort.

Reference-contexts: The metric could be delay, loss, bandwidth, jitter, or a combination of thereof. In <ref> [17] </ref>, an optimal routing scheme for multiple QoS parameters was considered. Although QoS requirements and network resources may be characterized by multiple parameters, under most of Weighted-Fair-Queueing-type service disciplines, one can satisfy user-requested QoS requirements by providing guaranteed throughput or bandwidth to each connection. <p> For link-state routing, a node's link-state database stores information about the utilization of each link which is defined as the sum of reserved bandwidths over the link. There are several strategies on how to choose an optimal route for real-time communication. For example, minimum-hop routing, shortest-widest path <ref> [17] </ref>, widest-shortest path [14], shortest-distance path [18], and minimum-load routing [19] are among them. Non-minimal routing algorithms, such as shortest-widest path, 3 often select circuitous routes that "occupy" more network resources, thus possibly causing rejection of future connection requests.

Reference-contexts: Hop count is selected as a basis because restricting the hop count of a path limits the degree to which the scheme can find a circuitous route around congested links, thus not blocking future connection requests, as argued in <ref> [20] </ref>. In order to determine whether a request message can reach the destination within the hop count limit via a particular outgoing link, each intermediate node uses its `almost static' network-topology information.
