Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) methods are very powerful tools to automate the knowledge acquisition (KA) task. Particularly, in ill-structured domains where there is no clear idea about which concepts exist, inductive unsupervised learning systems appear to be a promising approach to help experts in the early stages of the acquisition process. In this paper we examine the concept of inductive bias, which have received great attention from the ML community, and discuss the importance of bias shift when using ML algorithms to help experts in constructing a knowledge base (KB) A simple framework for the interaction of the expert with the inductive system exploiting bias shift is shown. Also, it is suggested that under some assumptions, bias selection in unsupervised learning may be performed via parameter setting, thus allowing the user to shift the system bias externally.

Reference-contexts: ML algorithms promised an effective way of automating the knowledge acquisition (KA) process thus reducing the interaction with experts. Furthermore, sometimes, the domain under study is ill-structured, that is, there is no clear idea about which concepts exist and their relationships <ref> [1] </ref>. In such a case, it is often easier for an expert to provide a set of relevant cases than to give a set of rules to describe the domain. For this reason, inductive learning appears as one of the most powerful ML methods as regards to KA.

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach, but still in line with the one proposed here, is to provide the expert some way to express partial knowledge about the domain under study.

Although some of these approaches do not mention the concept of declarative bias, they are a very promising way of integrating such biases within systems employing probabilistic representations of concepts.

Reference-contexts: To address this problem, inductive learning methods have to determine which hypotheses are better and discard the rest. The factors that influence the definition and selection of inductive hypotheses are called a bias <ref> [3] </ref>. It is easy to see that every inductive learning algorithm must include some form of bias, that is, it will always prefer some hypothesis over another. This fact explains the great attention that the idea of bias has always received from the ML community.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the original goals in developing Machine Learning (ML) programs was to overcome the well-known problem of the knowledge acquisition bottleneck <ref> [4] </ref>. ML algorithms promised an effective way of automating the knowledge acquisition (KA) process thus reducing the interaction with experts. Furthermore, sometimes, the domain under study is ill-structured, that is, there is no clear idea about which concepts exist and their relationships [1].

Reference-contexts: An example of the first approach is ID3 [7] which builds a decision tree from a set of labeled instances. ID3 can build only one tree for every dataset, so it cannot alter its biases to search for different hypotheses. A completely different approach is CLUSTER/2 <ref> [5] </ref>, an unsupervised system which provides the user with a set of parameters about his preferences on the concepts to be created. Therefore, the user may obtain different clusterings from the same dataset via parameter tuning.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we address one aspect which we consider of great interest in the application of inductive learning methods to KA, namely the capability of performing a bias shift. 2 Inductive bias Inductive learning can be characterized as a search in a hypotheses space <ref> [6] </ref>. For any given dataset, a potentially infinite number of hypotheses may be formulated and the problem of exploring all of them becomes intractable. To address this problem, inductive learning methods have to determine which hypotheses are better and discard the rest.

Reference-contexts: Sometimes this bias is encoded in the algorithm and it is impossible for the user to alter it, while other times some set of parameters exists which allow the user to choose the desired bias. An example of the first approach is ID3 <ref> [7] </ref> which builds a decision tree from a set of labeled instances. ID3 can build only one tree for every dataset, so it cannot alter its biases to search for different hypotheses.

Reference-contexts: of the bias which may vary from system to system and between different tasks, but suffice to say that it has to provide flexibility enough to cope with the expert goals. 4 Bias selection as parameter setting Relevant work in bias shift has been done within the declarative bias approach <ref> [8] </ref> which proposes an explicit specification of biases. To allow such an specification, logical representations of the hypothesis space are used. But the discovery nature of unsupervised learning implies that, in many cases, uncertainty will be present in the studied domains.

Reference-contexts: We think that our approach is better if the number of parameters is reasonable and they have sense for the expert. Some results using the ISAAC system seem to suggest that this idea is correct <ref> [9] </ref>. An alternative approach, but still in line with the one proposed here, is to provide the expert some way to express partial knowledge about the domain under study. We can find examples in KA [12] or also in Knowledge Discovery [2].

Reference-contexts: In order to consider a parameter as a good means of performing a bias shift, the parameter has to reflect some meaningful property of the concepts to be created. The ISAAC system <ref> [10] </ref>, for example, builds concept hierarchies allowing the user to specify the degree o generality of each level by means of a parameter. The system assumes that more general concepts can be discriminated using less attributes than specific ones.

Reference-contexts: Finally we have to point out that the framework proposed in this paper can be automated and performed without human intervention when a measurable performance goal for the induced KB is known <ref> [11] </ref>. In terms of the framework proposed in section 3, an automatic procedure would substitute the expert in the bias selection and validation stages.
