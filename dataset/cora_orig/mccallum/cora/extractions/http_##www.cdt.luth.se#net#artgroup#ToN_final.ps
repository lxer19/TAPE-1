Title: The PIM Architecture for Wide-Area Multicast Routing  
Author: Stephen Deering, Deborah Estrin, Dino Farinacci, Van Jacobson, Ching-gung Liu, Liming Wei 
Abstract: The purpose of multicast routing is to reduce the communication costs for applications that send the same data to multiple recipients. Existing multicast routing mechanisms were intended for use within regions where a group is widely represented or bandwidth is universally plentiful. When group members, and senders to those group members, are distributed sparsely across a wide area, these schemes are not efficient; data packets or membership report information are occasionally sent over many links that do not lead to receivers or senders, respectively. We have developed a multicast routing architecture that efficiently establishes distribution trees across wide area internets, where many groups will be sparsely represented. Efficiency is measured in terms of the router state, control message processing, and data packet processing, required across the entire network in order to deliver data packets to the members of the group. Our Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) architecture: a) maintains the traditional IP multicast service model of receiver-initiated membership; b) supports both shared and source-specific (shortest-path) distribution trees; c) is not dependent on a specific unicast routing protocol; and d) uses soft-state mechanisms to adapt to underlying network conditions and group dynamics The robustness, flexibility, and scaling properties of this architecture make it well suited to large heterogeneous internetworks.

Reference-contexts: However, periodically, the source's packets will be broadcast throughout the entire internet when the pruned-off branches times out. Thus far we have motivated our design by contrasting it to the traditional dense-mode IP multicast routing protocols. More recently, the Core Based Tree (CBT) protocol <ref> [1] </ref> was proposed to address similar scaling problems. CBT uses a single delivery tree for each group, rooted at a "core" router and shared by all senders to the group. As desired for sparse groups, CBT does not exhibit the occasional broadcasting behavior of earlier protocols.

Reference-contexts: The other major factor is the processing cost of the Dijk-stra shortest-path-tree calculations performed to compute the delivery trees for all active multicast sources [25], thus limiting its applicability on an internet wide basis. Distance-vector multicast routing protocols construct mul-ticast distribution trees using variants of Reverse Path Forwarding <ref> [7] </ref>. When the first data packet is sent to a group from a particular source subnetwork, and a router receiving this packet has no knowledge about the group, the router forwards the incoming packet out all interfaces except the incoming interface.

Reference-contexts: Senders simply use that address as the destination address of a packet to reach all members of the group. The separation of senders and receivers allows any host|member or non-member|to send to a group. A group membership protocol <ref> [8] </ref> is used for routers to learn the existence of members on their directly attached sub-networks. This receiver-initiated join procedure has very good scaling properties; as the group grows, it becomes more likely that a new receiver will be able to splice onto a nearby branch of the distribution tree. <p> There is an RP-flag indicating that this is a shared tree entry. sender joining a multicast group via an RP. When the receiver signals that it wants to join a PIM multicast group (i.e., by sending an IGMP message <ref> [8] </ref>), its first hop PIM router (A in fig 3) sends a PIM-Join message toward one of the RPs advertised for the group. (We explain how routers identify the appropriate RP for a group in later sections.) Processing of this message by intermediate routers sets up the multicast tree branch from

Senders simply use that address as the destination address of a packet to reach all members of the group. The separation of senders and receivers allows any host|member or non-member|to send to a group. <p> Some schemes reduce the number of outgoing interfaces further by using unicast routing protocol information to keep track of child-parent information <ref> [9, 29] </ref>. A special mechanism is used to avoid forwarding of data packets to leaf subnetworks with no members in that group (aka truncated broadcasting).

Reference-contexts: This implies that BGP/IDRP [28, 20] should carry two QOS flags: symmetry flag and multicast willing flag. If the generic route computed by hop-by-hop routing does not have the symmetry and multicast bits set, 10 but there is an SDRP <ref> [16] </ref> route that does, then the PIM message should be sent with an embedded SDRP route. This option needs to be added to PIM join messages. Its absence will indicate forwarding according to the router's unicast routing tables. Its presence will indicate forwarding according to the SDRP route.

Reference-contexts: The scheme begins with a simple, low-frequency, candidate-RP-advertisement protocol. Routers that are willing to act as RPs send Candidate-RP-Advertisement messages to a well-known, dense mode, multicast group such as that used by sd <ref> [17] </ref> for session advertisements. Each message includes an Intended-Hop-Count value set by the advertising router. The advertising router initializes the TTL in the containing IP packet to this Intended-hop-count value as a means of controlling the range of its advertisements and its resulting use as an RP.

Reference-contexts: Note that although some error bars in the delay graph extend below 1, there are no real data points below 1 | the distribution is not symmetric, for more details see <ref> [33] </ref>. For interactive applications where low latency is critical, it is desirable to use the trees based on shortest-path routing to avoid the longer delays of an optimal core-based tree. With respect to the potential traffic concentration problem, we also conducted simulations in randomly generated 50-node networks. <p> For example, shared tress may perform very well for large numbers of low data rate sources (e.g., resource discovery applications), while SPT (s) may be better suited for high data rate sources (e.g., real time teleconferencing); a more complete analysis of these tradeoffs can be found in <ref> [33] </ref>. It would be ideal to flexibly support both types of trees within one multicast 3 architecture, so that the selection of tree types becomes a configuration decision within a multicast protocol.
