Abstract: Twelve Ways to Fool the Masses When Giving Performance Results on Parallel Computers David H. Bailey RNR Technical Report RNR-91-020 June 11, 1991 Abstract Many of us in the field of highly parallel scientific computing recognize that it is often quite difficult to match the run time performance of the best conventional supercomputers. This humorous article outlines twelve ways commonly used in scientific papers and presentations to artificially boost performance rates and to present these results in the "best possible light" compared to other systems.
