Abstract: We consider the ways in which adaptive allocation is altered when some of the observations become unavailable. Such "missing outcomes" are a strong form of censoring. The problems analyzed involve adaptive sampling from two Bernoulli populations. Both fully sequential designs and few-stage designs are examined. For each type of design, we developed an algorithm to determine the optimal design. Prior approaches were ad hoc and did not fully optimize under the censoring assumptions. Perhaps one reason for this is that censoring turns the populations into 3-outcome populations, which increases the complexity of the problem. We also convert designs for uncensored problems into natural designs for the censored problem, and compare to the optimal design.

Reference-contexts: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the design of adaptive algorithms that are optimal for censoring. The closest work we have been able to find is that of Eick <ref> [1] </ref> and Hayre and Turnbull [4], but these papers consider models that are quite different than ours. In Section 2, we define our censoring model and the types of adaptive allocation problems we consider.

Reference-contexts: In this section we briefly describe the algorithms, and their computational complexity. Due to space limitations, the details of the algorithms are omitted. In general we only refer to the changes needed, compared to the algorithms for the uncensored situation. See <ref> [2, 3] </ref> for a more detailed explanation and pointers to the algorithms for the uncensored situation. 4.1 Optimal Designs Determining the optimal design for a censored environment is very similar to determining the optimal design for an uncensored one. One uses dynamic programming.

Reference-contexts: Several people have studied fixed and adaptive de signs for this problem, see the references in <ref> [3] </ref>. 2.2 Types of Adaptive Designs There are many different ways that adaptive experiments can be structured, and in general each different structure requires a different set of algorithms for design and analysis. In this work, we restricted ourselves to considering three types of designs: fully sequential, 1-stage, and 2-stage. <p> In this section we briefly describe the algorithms, and their computational complexity. Due to space limitations, the details of the algorithms are omitted. In general we only refer to the changes needed, compared to the algorithms for the uncensored situation.
