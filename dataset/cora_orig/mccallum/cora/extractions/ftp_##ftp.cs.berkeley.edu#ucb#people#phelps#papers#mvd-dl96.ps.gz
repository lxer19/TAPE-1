Title: Abstract general, a document management infrastructure built around a multivalent perspective can provide an extensible,
Note: In  
Abstract: Rich varieties of online digital documents are possible, documents which do not merely imitate the capabilities of other media. A true digital document provides an interface to potentially complex content. Since this content is infinitely varied and specialized, we must provide means to interact with it in arbitrarily specialized ways. Furthermore, since relevant content may be found in distinct documents, we must draw from multiple sources, yet provide a coherent presentation to the user. Finally, it is essential to be able to conveniently author new content, define new means of manipulation, and seamlessly mesh both with existing materials. We present a new general paradigm that regards documents with complex content as multivalent documents, comprising multiple layers of distinct but intimately related content. Small, dynamically-loaded program objects, or behaviors, activate the content and work in concert with each other and layers of content to support arbitrarily specialized document types. Behaviors bind together the disparate pieces of a multivalent document to present the user with a single unified conceptual document. As implemented in Java in the context of the World Wide Web, multivalent documents in effect create a customizable virtual Web, drawing together diverse content and functionality into coherent document-based interfaces to content. Examples of the diverse functionality in multivalent documents include: OCR select and paste, where the user describes a geometric region on the scanned image of a printed page and the corresponding text characters are copied out; video subtitling, which aligns a video clip with the script and language translations so that, e.g., the playing video can be presented simultaneously in multiple languages, and the video can be searched with text-based techniques; geographic information system (GIS) visualizations that compose several types of data from multiple datasets; and distributed user annotations that augment and may transform the content of other documents.

Reference-contexts: Because of the historic lack of programmability of WWW clients, these last two systems compose the text and image streams at the server. 6. Implementation Although Mosaic <ref> [Andr93] </ref> and Netscape [Nets94] are sufficient for simple viewing of simple media like images and text, full multivalent interaction requires a browser that can execute the program-objects. We have chosen Suns C++-like Java language [Gosl95]. Additionally, Java has the important properties of being platform independent, secure, and dynamically loadable.

Reference-contexts: We then provide a description of the multivalent architecture. This architecture is a networked model of digital documents that operates on top of a World Wide Web (WWW) <ref> [Bern92] </ref> augmented with protocols that allow more sophisticated structuring. The loosely coupled nature of the architecture introduces issues which are considered thereafter. We conclude with a look at related work and a statement of current status and future plans.

Reference-contexts: In the multivalent approach, complexity is built up from simple content and most interesting behaviors operate on multiple layers of content and with other behaviors. 5.2 Active Documents Many systems activate the digital page with program script control, including Active Tioga Documents [Terr90], Embedded Buttons <ref> [Bier91] </ref> and Computational E-mail [Bore92] to list but a few. In general these systems connect a script to a specific region of the document; in these regions the document is active, and elsewhere the document retains its ordinary properties.

Reference-contexts: Behaviors that introduce interaction modes would first be required to register the user interaction gestures in which they are interested, and only modes with disjoint sets of gestures would be allowed to coexist; enabling one automatically disables conicting behaviors. Alternatively, a Toolglass and Magic Lens <ref> [Bier93] </ref> style of interaction would seem to complement a multivalent document approach perfectly. Toolglasses carry collections of Magic Lens tools, and the user invokes a tool on a document by placing a lens over the affected area and operating through the lens.

Reference-contexts: Multivalent documents would provide the content and a set of tools; Toolglasses could organize them and a Magic Lenses would provide an excellent interaction paradigm. 5. Related Work 5.1 Compound Documents A comparison with compound document systems like OpenDoc [Nels95] and Microsofts OLE <ref> [Broc95] </ref> highlights the distinctive decomposition of the multivalent approach. In analogy to operating systems, the relationship between compound documents and multivalent documents parallels that between processes and threads. That is to say, compound documents organize multiple editors in the same document but at a much coarser level of granularity.

Reference-contexts: Current practice in the GIS world is to construct distinct systems for GIS content, e.g., ArcView. Indeed, our project has used such a stand-alone client, called Napa <ref> [Brow95] </ref>, which visualizes different types of geographic coverages stored in a data base. Like many GIS systems, Napa visually positions users at an altitude and provides a view of the earth from that latitude. The user can then pan and zoom.

Reference-contexts: In the multivalent approach, active regions vary according to what behaviors are active, and the content of that region varies according to what semantic layers are available. Others systems, such as Henry [Silv94] and Firey <ref> [Buch92] </ref>, coordinate external viewers or editors through narrow interapplication interfaces to induce on the heterogeneous content composite hyperlinks and temporal behavior.

Reference-contexts: Adobes Acrobat [Walt94] supports textual attachments tied to a geometric position on the page, and annotations from several users can be combined into a composite page, but no attempt is made to adjust to a modified base document. More advanced annotation systems like CoNote <ref> [Davi] </ref> and ComMentor [Rosc95] tie textual annotations to particular locations in the text stream, and compose annotations from multiple users; the latter system is robust against changes to the original document.

Reference-contexts: How the type graph facilitates seamless integration of unanticipated behaviors is illustrated by the TileBars <ref> [Hear94] </ref> searching visualization method. Briey, in a TileBars interface, the user enters search words for multiple term sets. For instance Figure 7 illustrates the result for one document of a search for two term sets, with term set one comprising ood fire drought and term set two, damage insurance.

Reference-contexts: A semantic structural layer could describe the location of these various commentaries. The scholar is instructed to read each commentary as if each were the only one on the page <ref> [Holt84] </ref>. This can be facilitated in the multivalent architecture with a general behavior that examines the structural layer and erases all commentaries but the selected one.

Reference-contexts: The query first goes to a handle server (similar to that described in <ref> [Kahn94] </ref>) that takes the name and returns a list of servers that have relevant information. The client queries this list of servers for the essential behaviors for minimal interaction with the document.

These reports consist of scanned page images that are analyzed for structure, characters transcription, and tables.
