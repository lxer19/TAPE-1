Abstract: The outline of an argument is presented for deducing the basic chemo-physical properties of life from the knowledge of physical law and von Neumann's theory of self-reproducing automata. This entails an introduction to the problems of the origin of life, and an argument against a common misinterpretation of the 2nd law of thermodynamics proliferated by popular books, e.g., Levy's Artificial Life (Levy 1992).

Reference-contexts: This was predicted by Dingra and Sarma by molecular modeling (Dingra and Sarma 1978). A theory how 3' 5" binding was selected by abiotic factors was developed by Usher, but such a theory may be unnecessary when one uses more plausible prebiotic condensing agents <ref> (Bartel and Szostak 1993) </ref>. Possible prebiotic synthetic pathways that yield ribose in large fractions of all sugars produced are examined in vitro (Eschenmoser 1994).

Reference-contexts: This is a consequence of U (1) gauge symmetry <ref> (Becher, Bohm and Joos 1981) </ref>. If one has as a source a complex charge distribution, a multipole expansion requires the consideration of tensor forces. However they decrease with higher powers of the distance and are probably shielded by the liquid medium.

Reference-contexts: This would be the first machine function that confers a selective advantage, because if oligomeres are used for replication it becomes ever more unprob-able that a complementary oligonucleotide is at hand when needed, especially for longer oligos. (Interestingly some self-splicing ribozymes have this ability even today <ref> (Been and Cech 1988) </ref>.) Also useful would be ribozymes that recharge oligonucleotides, for example, by phosphat transfer from polyphosphates. The next evolutionary step would be a RNA-replicase a la Szostak et al., that holds a unfolded RNA-strand complementary to itself and polymerizes oligos on it.

Burks <ref> (Burks 1970) </ref>, and a return to the more physically interesting "robot model", which will be the model referred to in this article. A more abstract formulation and generalization of the terms of the model would certainly be interesting.

If the oligomeres at the ends are larger than required for the complementary binding of the polymer ends, the forming "daughter-polymer" strand would be longer than the "parent-strand".

It would be very interesting to see in which ways these nanomachines differ from natural self-replicating machines for example only by the fact that the content of their warehouse is not constrained by abiotic production.

Reference-contexts: specific recognition and manipulation of precursors exclusively van der Waals contact or similar short range contact (possibly transmitted by one molecule of the liquid medium) between the sra and the parts to be worked on is required, this implies that the machine (or a collection of machines coupled in "Hypercyles," <ref> (Eigen and Schuster 1979) </ref>) must be bigger than the part to be altered. Because if only one side or part of a precursor which is to be modified is recognized, parts will be manufactured that have bulky side groups or are in other ways detrimental when incorporated in a sra. <p> These would have to be coupled in hyper-cycles <ref> (Eigen and Schuster 1979) </ref> 13 The requirement that the sra has to be as small as possible and can act as a machine, implies the constraint that a meta-stable folding of the polymer should be possible with as small a number of polymerized monomers as possible.

Reference-contexts: See Joyce (Joyce, Schwartz, Miller and Orgel 1987, Joyce 1989) for a thorough discussion on D,L-enantiomeric and alpha-beta-stereo-isomeric cross-inhibition in template directed replication. At least we know (experimentally!) through the work of Eschenmoser et al. <ref> (Eschenmoser 1994) </ref> that the connector has to be a pentose, because hexoses are too bulky to allow duplex formation. However, it is not clear that it has to be in furanose form. <p> Possible prebiotic synthetic pathways that yield ribose in large fractions of all sugars produced are examined in vitro <ref> (Eschenmoser 1994) </ref>.

However things are probably not that clearcut. A fundamental problem is the fact that the permeability of a membrane must be high enough to let the precursors of the sra pass easily. <p> DNA could have served as permanent information storage already in an RNA-world and there is theoretical (Hogeweg 1994) and experimental evidence. (cf Benner on dexoxyribonucleotide-reductases (Gesteland and Atkins 1993)) support for such a notion.) Furthermore, the linking of genes eases the general problem of parasitic interactions in groups of genes <ref> (Frank 1994) </ref>. The question whether DNA was developed after or before coded protein synthesis requires probably a more thorough examination of the replication machinery.

As a concrete example for a sra in an RNA world consider RNA-oligomeres ligating on a (only slightly longer) complementary RNA-polymer For a first experiment on simulating such a system see (Chou, Reggia, Navarro-Gonzalez and Wu 1994). <p> For a discussion when one considers replication by oligonucleotides or when only a subset of the nucleotides are considered to be important for the determination of structure, see Orgel in <ref> (Gesteland and Atkins 1993) </ref>.) The first machine function would be the ability of an RNA to function as a ribozyme that shu*es monomers between oligomeres. <p> Szostak proposed (Weiner and Maizels 1984) that DNA could have served as permanent information storage already in an RNA-world and there is theoretical (Hogeweg 1994) and experimental evidence. (cf Benner on dexoxyribonucleotide-reductases <ref> (Gesteland and Atkins 1993) </ref>) support for such a notion.) Furthermore, the linking of genes eases the general problem of parasitic interactions in groups of genes (Frank 1994). The question whether DNA was developed after or before coded protein synthesis requires probably a more thorough examination of the replication machinery. <p> The question whether DNA was developed after or before coded protein synthesis requires probably a more thorough examination of the replication machinery. The fact that even today the telomerase enzyme contains a RNA template may point to the latter possibility (cf Blackburn in <ref> (Gesteland and Atkins 1993) </ref>). 2.9 Thermodynamic Questions Two aspects not considered in this paper are the thermodynamic (Morrison 1964) and the ecological, i.e. the question of the first energy source for the sra and the direct interaction of the sras, not only through competition for resources.

Reference-contexts: This and the fact that it should be as small as possible poses a lot of difficulties. Szostak has shown that a ribozyme consisting of three small polymer-chains can do the job if supplied with the corresponding decanucleotides <ref> (Green and Szostak 1992) </ref>. This system has to assemble itself from three small polymers, bind one polymer, keep it unfolded, and synthesize the complementary strand on it. But the polymer is able to fold with the other two strands into a polymerase itself.

Reference-contexts: If one has as a source a complex charge distribution, a multipole expansion requires the consideration of tensor forces. However they decrease with higher powers of the distance and are probably shielded by the liquid medium. So it is doubtful whether these can do the things required above. See <ref> (Honig and Nicholls 1995) </ref> for what can be accomplished by electrostatic fields. This applies also to the long-range part of the van der Waals force, which is always attractive because it is caused by fluctuating electric dipoles even of uncharged molecules.

Differently put, what decides the outcome of the competition may be the fact that a self-recognizing system can replicate at lower concentration of its precursors than a system (probably an auto-catalytic reaction network) that has to rely on random collisions and reactions.

Reference-contexts: i. being bound to oligonucleotides, which when incorporated in a growing RNA-strand block further elongation (at least until the amino-acyl bond is spontaneously hydrolyzed, which could last longer if the process is happening in a iron sulfur world, because the thiolester amino-acyl bond is more stable than the conventional one <ref> (Szathmary 1993) </ref>) (In this world of low specificity the development of a hydrolytic ribozyme would probably be dangerous for the system as a whole.) (Furthermore it is assumed that the phosphory-lation reaction is also so unspecific that amino acids and (oligo-)nucleotides are activated with equal probability.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, a small volume is simpler to control than the outside, so the replicators have the possibility to build their own environment once they have gained control over the membrane gates. However, if the membrane is destroyed they face a environment they aren't adapted to. <ref> (Szathmary and Smith 1995) </ref> 2.8 Separation of Information and Function The origin of coded protein-synthesis is even more in the dark, as is the meaning of introns and exons and splicing.

Reference-contexts: Today, engineers and physicists have built various forms of physical realizations of the abstract mathematical idea of the Turing machine <ref> (Turing 1937, Minsky 1967, Dewdney 1989) </ref>. Apparantly, again with von Neumann's help, who translated his theory into the concrete von Neumann computer architecture.

Reference-contexts: Cited from Brack's article which discusses further special properties of water which would be of interest for a detailed discussion (Brack 1993).) A further clue is the fact that phosphoanhydride bonds have unusually large free energies of activation, i.e. are metastable in water <ref> (Voet and Voet 1995) </ref>. <p> One has to consider enthalpic and entropic factors in binding. The entropic factors concern the solvent, not the solute <ref> (Voet and Voet 1995) </ref>.) Regarding H-bonds in a polar medium one could argue that one needs more than one bond per part because otherwise the binding-energy between a precursor and a sra would be of the same magnitude as the one between a precursor and one solvent molecule.

Reference-contexts: A compartimentation only after invention of coded protein-synthesis seems unlikely.

Reference-contexts: In a fluid medium we could circumvent this argument and postulate covalent recognition bonds that have a lower stability against hydrolysis <ref> (Weber 1989) </ref>. As the ratio of hydrolytic decay times of recognition and structural bonds is given by the nature of the parts and the temperature, the ratio of the number, the recognition to structural bonds will be fixed also. This will severely constrain the possible construction of such a sra.

Reference-contexts: This is then the basis for the development of promotor systems that regulate gene expression. However, the preceding discussion should not imply that DNA was developed as a stable information storage only after the progression to coded protein synthesis. Szostak proposed <ref> (Weiner and Maizels 1984) </ref> that DNA could have served as permanent information storage already in an RNA-world and there is theoretical (Hogeweg 1994) and experimental evidence. (cf Benner on dexoxyribonucleotide-reductases (Gesteland and Atkins 1993)) support for such a notion.) Furthermore, the linking of genes eases the general problem of parasitic interactions

Reference-contexts: Possible prebiotic synthetic pathways that yield ribose in large fractions of all sugars produced are examined in vitro (Eschenmoser 1994). Last but not least, Westheimer has argued that phosphate is optimally suited as connector element for nucleotides in watery solution because of its charge structure <ref> (Westheimer 1987) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This would make the whole polymer too stiff for folding. The recognition function and the connection function of a monomer should be decoupled. Maybe one could show that the inter-strand-bond should be placed on the connection element <ref> (Whoriskey, Usman and Szostak 1995) </ref>. This implies that the connection element has four bonds (one of them weak). All this logical requirements constrain not enough to conclude that the connector has to contain ribose, (with which one has a lot of stereo-chemical problems anyway.
