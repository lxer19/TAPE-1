Abstract: 1 Adrian E. Raftery is Professor of Statistics and Sociology, and Judith E. Zeh is Re- search Associate Professor, both at the Department of Statistics, University of Washing- ton, Box 354322, Seattle, WA 98195-4322, USA. E-mail: raftery@stat.washington.edu and zeh@stat.washington.edu. Web: http://www.stat.washington.edu/raftery. This research was supported by the North Slope Borough (Alaska), the State of Alaska (through the Alaska Department of Community and Regional Affairs), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad- ministration (through the National Marine Mammal Laboratory to the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission). We are very grateful to Andrew A. Schaffner for excellent research assistance. We thank Dr. Thomas F. Albert, Craig George and other scientists and personnel from the Borough's Department of Wildlife Management, the many other researchers with whom we have worked, most of whose names appear on papers in our reference list, the census crew, and the Eskimo hunters of the Borough, for their contributions to our understanding of bowhead whales and the census. We are also grateful to Geof Givens for useful discussions, and to Doug Butterworth and Andre Punt for their suggestions about the rate of increase estimate.

Reference-contexts: than 1993, and a relatively small number of "identified tracks" from the 1993 census itself, made up either of visual locations which the visual observers were almost certain were of the same whale, or of acoustic locations identified as being from the same whale on the basis of spectrogram analysis <ref> (Clark 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One problem with the visual census was that it could not count animals passing more than about 4 km from the shore. An effort to overcome this was made in 1981 by flying aerial transect surveys, but these gave only limited information <ref> (Marquette, Braham, Nerini and Miller 1982) </ref>. A second problem with the visual census was that it could not count whales swimming under the ice.

Reference-contexts: This is not surprising given the dependence of the number of locations on the number of whales present, and the highly dispersed distribution of the latter. However, parameter estimation using the binomial log-likelihood remains valid <ref> (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989, p. 126) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The left-hand side of equation (7) is the complementary log-log transform of p (V j A). The value of c was estimated by iterating between (a) fitting equation (7) using GLIM; and (b) setting equation (6) equal to the exact value <ref> (calculated as in Raftery and Zeh 1993) </ref>. The iteration is started by setting c = 1. We estimated fi V 0 , fi V 2 using the GLIM program (Baker and Nelder, 1978) with binomial error, complementary log-log link and offset D V z .
