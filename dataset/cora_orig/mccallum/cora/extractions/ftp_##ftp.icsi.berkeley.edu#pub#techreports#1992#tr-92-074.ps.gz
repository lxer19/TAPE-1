Abstract: We consider the probabilistic relationship between the value of a random asymmetric traveling salesman problem AT SP (M) and the value of its assignment relaxation AP (M). We assume here that the costs are given by an n fi n matrix M whose entries are independently and identically distributed. We focus on the relationship between P r(AT SP (M) = AP (M)) and the probability p n that any particular entry is zero. If np n ! 1 with n then we prove that AT SP (M) = AP (M) with probability 1-o(1). This is shown to be best possible in the sense that if np(n) ! c, c &gt; 0 and constant, then P r(AT SP (M) = AP (M)) &lt; 1 (c) for some positive function . Finally, if np n ! 0 then P r(AT SP (M) = AP (M)) ! 0.

Reference-contexts: It is evident from the parallelism between the above two definitions that AP (M ) AT SP (M ). The ATSP is NP-hard, whereas the AP is solvable in time O (n 3 ). Several authors (for a recent survey see <ref> [BaTo] </ref>) have investigated whether the AP can be used effectively in a branch-and-bound method to solve the ATSP. The most striking evidence of the power of this approach is given by the recent work of Miller and Pekny.

Reference-contexts: This follows from the manner in which we generate M . It is convenient now to give a lower bound for the probability t;n that a random cycle cover has a cycle of length at most t, (more precise esitmates are available, see for example Bollobas <ref> [B] </ref>). We will use t;n 1 1 t+1 . To see this use induction on t;n = @ 2t 1 + i=t+1 1 which is a consequence of the fact that the size of the cycle containing 1 is uniformly distributed. The following lemma then follows easily.

Reference-contexts: Randomly permute its rows and columns. Then for each i; j 2 [n] replace M i;j with zero, with probability p n . There is also the proviso that the probability of two identical columns should tend to zero with n.) Frieze <ref> [Fr] </ref> has shown that, if w (n) = ln n + t (n), where t (n) tends to infinity, then AT SP (M ) = 0 (whp), and so AP (M ) = AT SP (M ) (whp).

Reference-contexts: We conjecture that for distributions of this type, the probability that AP (M ) = AT SP (M ) tends to some positive constant less than 1 which depends on c.

Reference-contexts: Then the z ij are independent, and each z ij is equal to 1 with probability p. Emulating a useful trick due to Walkup <ref> [Wal1] </ref> we view the z ij as being generated in the following way.

Reference-contexts: The proof follows immediately from Walkup's result <ref> [Wal2] </ref> that a random k-out bipartite graph has a perfect matching (whp) for any k 2. 2 Thus, we can obtain an optimal assignment (whp) by combining an optimal matching covering A [B with a perfect matching in the subgraph of H 1 [H 2 induced by (XnA)[(Y nB) 6 Structure
