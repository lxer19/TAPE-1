Title: On Approximation Hardness of Dense TSP and other Path Problems  
Author: W. Fernandez de la Vega and M. Karpinski

Abstract: TSP(1,2) is the problem of finding a tour with minimum length in a complete weighted graph where each edge has length 1 or 2. Let d o satisfy 0 &lt; d o &lt; 1=2. We show that TSP(1,2) has no PTAS on the set of instances where the density of the subgraph spanned by the edges with length 1 is bounded below by d o . We also show that LONGEST PATH has no PTAS on the set of instances with density bounded below by d o .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There have been recently several negative results concerning particular cases of the TSP and LONGEST PATH problem. Trevisan [T97] proved that metric TSP is Max-SNP-hard in R logn for every ` p metric. (Arora proved <ref> [A97] </ref> that metric TSP has a PTAS for every fixed dimension.) Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [PY93] proved that TSP (1,2), the traveling salesman problem with lengths one and two, is Max-SNP-hard.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, they proved that LONGEST PATH has no PTAS (polynomial time approximation scheme) on Hamiltonian graphs. Both results were improved by Bazgan, Santha and Tuza <ref> [BST98] </ref> who showed that LONGEST PATH is not constant factor approximable for cubic Hamiltonian graphs, unless P=NP. The purpose of this note is to prove that LONGEST PATH and TSP (1,2) are both Max-SNP-hard for "dense" instances.

Reference-contexts: Using this result, Karger, Mot-wani and Ramkumar <ref> [KMR93] </ref> proved that LONGEST PATH is not constant factor approximable unless P=NP, even for graphs with maximum degree 4. Moreover, they proved that LONGEST PATH has no PTAS (polynomial time approximation scheme) on Hamiltonian graphs. <p> Then, LONGEST PATH is Max-SNP-hard when restricted to instances with density at least d o The next theorem is immediate from Theorem 2 and the fact, observed by Karger, Motwani and Ramkumar <ref> [KMR93] </ref>, that, for any set of instances, a PTAS for LONGEST PATH implies a PTAS for TSP (1,2) on the corresponding subset of Hamiltonian instances Theorem 3 Let d o satisfy 0 &lt; d o &lt; 1=2.
