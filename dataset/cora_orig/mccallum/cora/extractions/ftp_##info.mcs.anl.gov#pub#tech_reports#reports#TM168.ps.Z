Title: ADIFOR Working Note #10: ADIFOR Case Study: VODE ADIFOR  
Author: by George Corliss 
Abstract: ADIFOR can be used to generate the Jacobians required by VODE in a manner that is easy to use. We provide a template to interface the ADIFOR-generated code with VODE and show how the template is used in a sample system of stiff ordinary differential equations. The ADIFOR-generated code is about 10% faster than the hand-coded Jacobian for this example.

Reference-contexts: 1 VODE VODE (Variable-coefficient Ordinary Differential Equation solver) [4] is a popular solver for stiff ordinary differential equations. The code is available from netlib, is well documented, and is widely used. We were interested in exploring VODE applications to see how ADIFOR (Automatic DIfferenti ation in FORtran) <ref> [2] </ref> would perform in this context. The user of VODE must provide a subroutine of the form shown in Listing 1.
