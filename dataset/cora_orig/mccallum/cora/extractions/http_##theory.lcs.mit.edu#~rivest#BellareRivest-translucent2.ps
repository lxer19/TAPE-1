Abstract: To appear in Journal of Cryptology. Preliminary version appeared as MIT/LCS Technical Report Abstract We present an alternative to the controversial "key escrow" techniques for enabling law-enforcement and national security access to encrypted communications. Our proposal allows such access with probability p for each message, for a parameter p between 0 and 1 to be chosen (say, by Congress) to provide an appropriate balance between concerns for individual privacy, on the one hand, and the need for such access by law-enforcement and national security, on the other. (For example, with p = 0:4, a law-enforcement agency conducting an authorized wiretap which records 100 encrypted conversations would expect to be able to decrypt (approximately) 40 of these conversations; the agency would not be able to decrypt the remaining 60 conversations at all.) Our scheme is remarkably simple to implement, as it requires no prior escrowing of keys. We implement translucent cryptography based on non-interactive oblivious transfer. Extending the schemes of Bellare and Micali [2], who showed how to transfer a message with probability 1=2, we provide schemes for non-interactive fractional oblivious transfer, which allow a message to be transmitted with any given probability p. Our protocol is based on the Diffie-Hellman assumption and uses just one El Gamal encryption (two exponentiations), regardless of the value of the transfer probability p. This makes the implementation of translucent cryptography competitive, in efficiency of encryption, with current suggestions for software key escrow. fl Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Mail Code 0114, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.

Reference-contexts: Non-interactive oblivious transfer was introduced by Bellare and Micali [2], who provided an implementation achieving transfer probability 1=2.

We begin by noting simple solutions for certain values of p. Then we move on to the general case, and present two protocols. 5.1 Some simple special cases A one out of n NFOT. <p> Arbitrary p.

Reference-contexts: The resulting translucent scheme is as efficient, in terms of encryption, as current suggestions for software key escrow. Specifically, we need one El Gamal encryption (two exponentiations), which is the same as the cost of encryption in the Diffie-Hellman system. Non-interactive oblivious transfer was introduced by Bellare and Micali <ref> [2] </ref>, who provided an implementation achieving transfer probability 1=2. We extend this to achieve transfer probability any fraction p 2 [0; 1], at no added encryption cost. We call our scheme the "polynomial" scheme because it exploits properties of low degree polynomials over finite fields. <p> With non-interactive oblivious transfer, Larry needs merely to receive (or overhear) Alice's message in order to decrypt it with probability one-half.

(There, Bob would have public key V = g x and private key x, and Alice would send him a message s by sending E (s; V ).) The above protocol differs in presentation and inessential minor respects from that proposed by Bellare and Micali; see their paper <ref> [2] </ref> for other methods and discussion. It is important to note that successive oblivious transfers are not independent: if Alice sends two successive messages using Larry's public key V , Larry either receives them both or receives neither of them. <p> The underlying issue of revelation of the secret index of a recipient in a NIOT based on some action of the recipient arose, and was recognized, in the context of implementing non-interactive zero-knowledge based on NIOT <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: With probability p this information allows Larry to determine the message key s, and thus to decrypt the first field to obtain the message m. The second field would typically consist of the encryption of s under Bob's public key, as is done for example in Privacy Enhanced Mail <ref> [18] </ref>. Bob can reliably decrypt this field to obtain s, and thus to decrypt the first field to obtain the message m. In a variation, the session key s would be encrypted in a DES key known only to Alice and Bob.

The current administration seems committed to the idea that the government should be able to read encrypted communications to support law-enforcement or national security objectives, when appropriately authorized.
