Title: Multilingual and Crosslingual Speech Recognition

Abstract: This paper describes the design of a multilingual speech recognizer using an LVCSR dictation database which has been collected under the project GlobalPhone. This project at the University of Karl-sruhe investigates LVCSR systems in 15 languages of the world, namely Arabic, Chinese, Croatian, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tamil, and Turkish. For our experiments we used six of these languages to train and test several recognition engines in monolingual, multilingual and crosslingual setups. Based on a global phoneme set we built a multilingual speech recognition system which can handle five different languages. The acoustic models of the five languages are combined into a monolithic system and context dependent phoneme models are created using language questions.

Fast and efficient bootstrapping of recognition systems in new languages even if only a small amount of training data is avail able [3], [4]. Combining acoustic models requires the definition of multilingual phonetic inventories.

Combining acoustic models requires the definition of multilingual phonetic inventories. Previous systems with combined acoustic phonetic models have been limited to context independent modeling. For the monolingual case context dependent modeling is proven to increase recognition performance significantly. <p> In these languages we defined a 10K test dictionary by supplementing the test word set with the most frequently seen training words. 3. Fast Systems Bootstrapping For a baseline we developed five monolingual LVCSR systems for Croatian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Turkish, applying our fast crosslingual bootstrap technique <ref> [4] </ref> to initialize the acoustic models for the not yet modeled languages. For each language the resulting context dependent monolingual system consists of a fully continuous 3-state HMM system with 1500 polyphone models.

Reference-contexts: Their speech was recorded in office quality, with a close-talking microphone. The GlobalPhone corpus is fully transcribed including spontaneous effects like false starts and hesitations. Further details of the GlobalPhone project are given in <ref> [5] </ref>. Table 1 shows the parts of the GlobalPhone database used for training. The test set consists of 100 utterances per language. Because of the currently limited corpus size of about 60K to 300K spoken words, we are not able to estimate reliable LVCSR n-gram models.

Reference-contexts: Multilingual Experiments For multilingual speech recognition we wish to combine acoustic models of similar sounds across languages into one multilingual phoneme set. Similarities of sounds are documented in international phonetic inventories like Sampa, Worldbet, or IPA <ref> [6] </ref>, which classify sounds based on phonetic knowledge. On the other hand, it might be useful to find the similarities of sound in a data-driven way [7], [8]. In our work we defined a global phoneme set based on the IPA scheme.
