Abstract: After recalling briefly some basic properties of the quantum group GL q (2), we study the quantum sphere S 2 q , quantum projective space CP q (N) and quantum Grassmannians as examples of complex (Kahler) quantum manifolds. The differential and integral calculus on these manifolds are discussed. It is shown that many relations of classical projective geometry generalize to the quantum case. For the case of the quantum sphere a comparison is made with A. Connes' method.

Reference-contexts: These have been studied by P. Podles [3, 4, 5, 6] who has defined quantum spheres as quantum spaces on which quantum SU q (2) coacts. He has also developed a noncommutative differential calculus on them. In these lectures we consider, following <ref> [7] </ref>, a special case of Podles spheres which is one of those special to three space dimensions. In this case the quantum sphere S 2 q is the analogue of the classical sphere defined as SU (2)=U (1) or as isomorphic to CP (1). <p> 1 : (3:114) For consistency with the fl-involution of the braided algebra the braiding order of z; z; z 0 and z 0 has to be z &lt; z 0 &lt; z 0 &lt; z after we have fixed z &lt; z 0 and z &lt; z as assumed in <ref> [7] </ref>. It is crucial that we braid separately A = hf1; zgi with A 0 and A 0 , and A = hf1; zgi with A 0 and A 0 instead of simply braiding the whole algebra hf1; z; zgi with hf1; z 0 ; z 0 gi.

Reference-contexts: The quantum sphere appears then as the quantum deformation of the classical two-sphere described as a complex Kahler manifold. We discuss the differential and integral calculus on S 2 q and the action of SU q (2) vector fields on it. Finally, following <ref> [8] </ref>, we show that one can define on braided copies of S 2 q invariant anharmonic cross ratios analogous to the classical ones. All this is done in Sec.3, after recalling briefly in Sec.2 the basic properties of GL q (2) and SU q (2). <p> Since we know how z; z 0 and z 0 transform, we can use (3.101) to derive the braided commutation relations <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> h1i: (4:125) Therefore h 1 i N i = h1i N [a] q : (4:126) For this to be positive definite, i a should be restricted such that I a + a &gt; 0 for a = 1; ; N . 4.6 Braided CP q (N ) As described in <ref> [8] </ref> and also in section 3.5.1, it is sufficient to know the transformation property of the algebra to derive the braiding. But as demonstrated there, it is already quite complicated to obtain explicit formulas in the case of a one dimensional algebra.

Reference-contexts: All this is done in Sec.3, after recalling briefly in Sec.2 the basic properties of GL q (2) and SU q (2). The above results are generalized in Secs.4 and 5 to quantum CP q (N ) and in Sec.6 to quantum Grassmannians <ref> [9] </ref>. These quantum spaces appear as complex Kahler quantum manifolds which can be described in terms of homogeneous or inhomogeneous coordinates. Differential and integral calculus can be defined on them as well as the quantum analogues of projective invariants.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, our Poisson structure is intimately related to the Kahler form, as just explained. For the algebra of functions on the sphere, this singular Poisson structure was already considered in <ref> [10] </ref>. All formulas and derivations of Sec.3 can be easily modified, with a few changes of signs, to describe the quantum unit disk and the coaction of quantum SU q (1; 1) on it, as well as the corresponding invariant anharmonic ratios. <p> For instance, the commutation relation (3.10) gives z z = (1 h)zz h + [h 2 ] (3:79) and therefore <ref> [10] </ref> 7 (z; z) = : (3:80) Similarly one finds (dz; z) = zdz; (dz; z) = zdz; (3.81) and (dz; dz) = dzdz: (3.83) In this classical limit functions and forms commute or anticommute according to their even or odd parity, as usual.

It is a one-parameter deformation of the classical group GL (2). The algebra of functions on GL (2) is generated by the elements ff; fi; fl; ffi in the fundamental representation (g) = ff (g) fi (g) ! for g 2 GL (2). <p> To find out whether these invariants are independent of one another, we now discuss the algebra of the [ij]'s. Because [ij] = [ik] + [kj] and [ij] = [ji] the algebra of [ij] for i; j = 1; 2; 3; 4 is generated by only three elements <ref> [12] </ref>; [23]; [34]. It is easy to prove that [ij][kl] = q 2 [kl][ij] (3:129) It follows that we have [ij][ik][jk] = q 4 [jk][ik][ij] (3:130) [12][34] + [14][23] = [12][24] + [24][23]: (3:131) Using these relations we can check the dependency between the different anharmonic ratios.

Reference-contexts: This is attempted in <ref> [23] </ref> and interesting results are obtained. As before, the variables z and z cover the sphere except for the north pole, while w = 1=z and w = 1=z miss the south pole. <p> To find out whether these invariants are independent of one another, we now discuss the algebra of the [ij]'s. Because [ij] = [ik] + [kj] and [ij] = [ji] the algebra of [ij] for i; j = 1; 2; 3; 4 is generated by only three elements [12]; <ref> [23] </ref>; [34]. It is easy to prove that [ij][kl] = q 2 [kl][ij] (3:129) It follows that we have [ij][ik][jk] = q 4 [jk][ik][ij] (3:130) [12][34] + [14][23] = [12][24] + [24][23]: (3:131) Using these relations we can check the dependency between the different anharmonic ratios.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in Appendix A, we try to re-formulate the differential and integral calculus on the quantum sphere in a way as close as possible to Connes' formulation of quantum Riemannian geometry <ref> [27] </ref>. We will use the following notations throughout the paper: = q q 1 (1:1) [n] q = q 2 1 2 GL q (2) AS EXAMPLE OF A QUANTUM GROUP The simplest example of a matrix quantum group [11] as a Hopf algebra [12] is GL q (2) [1]. <p> a !

(1) k !F (4:54) where ! is a k-form and F is an operator such that F fl = F and F 2 = 1. 12 In the bicovariant calculus on quantum groups [17], <p> K also has the very nice property of commuting with everything Kz a = z a K; Kdz a = dz a K: (4:75) We see here an example of Connes' calculus <ref> [27] </ref> of the type F 2 6= 0 rather than F 2 = 0. We consider a few examples of this construction. <p> De- partment of Energy under Contract DE-AC03-76SF00098 and in part by the National Science Foundation under grant PHY-9514797. A RELATION TO CONNES' FORMULATION Here we make a comment on the relation of our work to Connes' quantum Riemannian geometry <ref> [27] </ref>. We will try to re-formulate the differential and integral calculus on the quantum sphere in a way as close to his formulation as possible. We take 0 &lt; q 1. To do so we first give the spectral triple (X; H; D) for this case.

Here d is the dimension of the quantum space, which, according to Connes, is defined by the series of eigenvalues of jDj 1 . In our case d determined that way is zero.
