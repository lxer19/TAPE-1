Abstract: We investigate the distribution of nonuniform complexities in uniform complexity classes. We prove that almost every problem decidable in exponential space has essentially maximum circuit-size and space-bounded Kolmogorov complexity almost everywhere. (The circuit-size lower bound actually exceeds, and thereby strengthens, the Shannon 2 n n lower bound for almost every problem, with no computability constraint.) In exponential time complexity classes, we prove that the strongest relativizable lower bounds hold almost everywhere for almost all problems. Finally, we show that infinite pseudorandom sequences have high nonuniform complexity almost everywhere. The results are unified by a new, more powerful formulation of the underlying measure theory, based on uniform systems of density functions, and by the introduction of a new nonuniform complexity measure, the selective Kolmogorov complexity.

Reference-contexts: Minor variations of Shannon's estimate have appeared many times. The argument here, included for completeness, is similar to that of Balcazar, Daz, and Gabarro <ref> [4] </ref>.) In an n-input circuit with s gates, each gate has fewer than 6 (n + s) 2 possible specifications of its function and the sources of its inputs. Thus there are fewer than 6 s (n + s) 2s such circuits.

Regarding the Kannan ESPACE6P/Poly result, we addressed the following question.

This question led to the development of resource-bounded category and measure in [24]. These techniques, which extend classical and effective versions of Baire category and Lebesgue measure (see [33,9,7,30,31]), define the meager ("topologically small") and measure 0 ("probabilistically small") subsets of various complexity classes, respectively.

These techniques, which extend classical and effective versions of Baire category and Lebesgue measure (see [33,9,7,30,31]), define the meager ("topologically small") and measure 0 ("probabilistically small") subsets of various complexity classes, respectively. It was proven in [24] that P/Poly"ESPACE is a meager, measure 0 subset of ESPACE. Thus the phenomenon of not having polynomial-size circuits is very typical of problems in ESPACE, in the sense of both category and measure. 2 In this paper we prove that the Shannon effect holds with full force in ESPACE. <p> This almost-everywhere lower bound on circuit-size complexity in ESPACE extends the previous work in two significant ways. (i) The 2 n n ) lower bound here exceeds the o ( 2 n n ) lower bound of <ref> [24] </ref> and is only negligibly smaller than the Lupanov 2 n n (1 + O ( 1 p n )) upper bound for every x 2 f0; 1g 1 .

(In fact, the present lower bound slightly exceeds, and as a consequence tightens, the Shannon 2 n n lower bound for almost every x 2 f0; 1g 1 .) (ii) The lower bound here is proven to hold for almost every n, whereas the lower bound in <ref> [24] </ref> is only shown to hold for infinitely many n.

In this paper we use our almost-everywhere lower bounds to 4 show that infinite pseudorandom sequences have high circuit-size and Kolmogorov complex-ity almost everywhere. Note: The resource-bounded measure introduced in <ref> [24] </ref>, and used to define pseudorandom sequences in [25], was formulated in terms of "covering by modulated enumerations of cylinders." This formulation is not strong enough (i.e., does not render enough sets measurable) to prove the main results of the present paper. <p> Various choices of this parameter give various measure theories as special cases. One of these cases is classical Lebesgue measure. Other special cases impose internal measure-theoretic structure on REC, E, ESPACE, and other complexity classes. All sets measurable in the formulation of <ref> [24] </ref> have the same measure in the new formulation, and the new formulation admits rigorous (and simpler) proofs of the applications in [24,25]. Moreover, the new formulation, by expanding the class of measurable sets, has yielded a number of new applications, especially in time-bounded complexity classes. <p> We write R () for the set of languages R (ffi) such that ffi is a constructor in .

The formulation here, based on uniform systems of density functions, is much more powerful than the "modulated covering" formulation of <ref> [24] </ref>. Definition 3.1. A density function is a function d : f0; 1g fl ! [0; 1) satisfying d (w) 2 for all w 2 f0; 1g . The global value of a density function d is d (). <p> Corollary 4.7 (Huynh [13]).

Note: The resource-bounded measure introduced in [24], and used to define pseudorandom sequences in <ref> [25] </ref>, was formulated in terms of "covering by modulated enumerations of cylinders." This formulation is not strong enough (i.e., does not render enough sets measurable) to prove the main results of the present paper.

Reference-contexts: We have first used uniform systems of such density functions to define resource-bounded measure, and only then used resource-bounded measure to define pseudo randomness. (See x6 below and [27].) This is a natural development in investigating the internal, measure-theoretic structure of complexity classes. 20 In <ref> [26] </ref>, the measurability of sets X f0; 1g 1 and the measure (X) of -measurable sets (0 (X) 1) are defined and developed in terms of uniform systems of density functions. Definition 3.5 above is a special case (the measure zero/one case) of these definitions. <p> A set X f0; 1g 1 has -measure 0 if and only if there exists a - computable martingale d that succeeds on every sequence x 2 X. 2 (We will not use Theorem 3.19 in this paper. The proof will appear in <ref> [26] </ref>.) Notwithstanding the contrast between our approach and his, we emphasize that many technical aspects of x3 (e.g., much of the content of the Measure Conservation Theorem) were already present, some twenty years ago, in the work of C. P. Schnorr. 4.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we are primarily concerned with resource-bounded Kolmogorov complexities, which have been investigated by Hartmanis [10], Sipser [39], Ko [17], Longpre [22], Balcazar and Book [3], Huynh [13], Lutz [24], Allender and Watanabe [2], and many others.

Reference-contexts: Our proof of Corollary 4.9 is essentially that of Theorem 4.4, with resource bounds relaxed and selectors removed (i.e., replaced by the selector (n) = ? n ). With these modifications, the proof is a transparent covering argument, simpler than the Meyer and McCreight <ref> [32] </ref> weighted priority diagonaliza-tion used by Ko [17] to prove Corollary 4.10. Does this give us a new proof of Corollary 4.10, free of the weighted priority diagonalization? Not really.

Reference-contexts: For the most important nonuniform complexity measures those that measure size of programs and size of circuits this paper establishes new lower bounds that hold almost everywhere in uniform time and space complexity classes. The circuit-size complexity of Boolean functions has been studied for over fifty years. Shannon <ref> [38] </ref> proved that every Boolean function f : f0; 1g n ! f0; 1g is computed by a circuit with O ( 2 n n ) gates and that, asymptotically, almost every such function requires more than 2 n n (1 *) gates, for every * &gt; 0. <p> We now estimate the number H x (n) of strings y that are novel for n and have size (y) g x (n). (Such an estimate was first computed by Shannon <ref> [38] </ref>. Minor variations of Shannon's estimate have appeared many times. <p> It follows by Theorem 4.4 that the set of all x 2 f0; 1g 1 satisfying (5.4) has pspace-measure 0. Since (5.3) implies (5.4), this proves the theorem. 2 As an immediate consequence of Theorem 5.3, we have the following strengthening of Shannon's almost-everywhere lower bound <ref> [38] </ref> on circuit size. Theorem 5.4.

Reference-contexts: Putting these advances together gives our strong formulation of the Shannon effect in ESPACE: almost every problem in ESPACE has essentially maximum circuit-size complexity almost everywhere.

Reference-contexts: It is widely believed that NP6P/Poly, i.e., that NP-complete problems are infeasible in a strong, information-theoretic sense.

On the other hand, Wilson <ref> [44] </ref> has exhibited oracles relative to which E 2 =DTIME (2 poly ) P/Poly and problems in NP and E=DTIME (2 linear ) all have linear-size circuits, so progress towards resolving this conjecture may not come easily.
