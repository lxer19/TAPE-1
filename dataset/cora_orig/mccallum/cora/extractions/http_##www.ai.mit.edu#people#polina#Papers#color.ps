Reference-contexts: These detectors will be called D r , D g and D b and their sensitivity or tuning curves will be denoted by ' r (), ' g () and ' b () accordingly. If all detectors are exposed to the same input spectrum S (), the color perception <ref> [4, 5, 1, 8, 7] </ref> is determined by three non-negative numbers, denoted by (r; g; b), obtained from the formulas: r = g = b = the integration being over the visible range . <p> All the colors which can be reproduced by the gun system defined above are linear combinations of vectors f ~ b 1 ; ~ b 2 ; ~ b 3 g with coefficients belonging to the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, so it will be natural to define our cost function as the volume of a parallelepiped spanned by the vectors f ~ b 1 ; ~ b 2 ; ~ b 3 g, which is proportional to the determinant of 3 : f ( 1 ; 2 ; 3 <p> Then the tuning curves of the human visual system are analyzed and an optimal set of display gun wavelength is determined. Its relationship with other standard color systems is discussed. 4 a b a g a r 1 J b '() ' g () 1 r g <ref> [a r ; 1] </ref> (a) Sensitivity curves.
