Abstract: The functionally-accurate, cooperative (FA/C) distributed problem-solving paradigm is one approach for organizing distributed problem solving among homogeneous, cooperating agents. While several FA/C systems have been implemented, there has been little formal analysis of the quality of the solutions that can be produced using the approach or of the conditions that are necessary for the approach to be effective. This paper reports on work we have done to formally analyze the FA/C model in the context of distributed sensor interpretation (SI). Results are presented that compare the quality of solutions produced by a distributed FA/C system to those produced by an equivalent centralized system. We first establish that while it is possible for an FA/C system to produce the same solution as a centralized system, this requires the use of interpretation and coordination strategies that are impractical for most SI applications. We then consider the effect of "approximate" interpretation and coordination strategies.

Reference-contexts: This can greatly increase the efficiency of distributed problem solving. Unfortuntely, we show that such strategies do not in general provide any guarantees about the quality of the global solutions (regardless of the local interpretation strategies being used). In <ref> (Carver, Lesser, & Whitehair 1996) </ref> we suggested that many SI problems have a characteristic that can allow such strategies to produce reasonable global solutions. We have called such problems nearly monotonic. <p> The figure shows one possible outcome for the example when the local solutions are inconsistent, but we have deliberately left unspecified, the behavior of an LSRS when local solutions are inconsistent (because it is not required for our results). See <ref> (Carver & Lesser 1996) </ref> for a more complete description of one possible LSRS. Finally, the quality of the global solutions that result from these coordination strategies is clearly influenced by the local interpretation strategy being used by the agents. <p> In <ref> (Carver & Lesser 1996) </ref> we proposed that one possible explanation for this apparent contradiction is that many SI domains have characteristics that allow this strategy to work quite well. We have termed such problems nearly monotonic. <p> To formalize this notion we have used probabilistic models of the likelihood of a hypothesis being correct given its current belief based on local agent data only. <ref> (Carver & Lesser 1996) </ref> contains a theorem that shows that in nearly monotonic domains the LSRS can potentially produce a global solution whose components are as likely to be in the MPE global solution as desired (by selecting appropriate criteria that local solutions must meet prior to being exchanged).

Reference-contexts: The aspect of performance that we address here is the quality of the (global) solutions that can be produced by FA/C systems. To analyze solution quality, we need some standard for comparison. One possible definition of the best global solution would be the most probable explanation (MPE) <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref> given all of the globally available data. The problem with this definition is that for most real-world SI problems it is impractical to compute the (true) MPE. <p> We leave open whether belief ratings will be the true condition probabilities See <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref> for a discussion of the differences between computing beliefs (belief updating) and computing MPE solution membership (belief revision) in probabilistic belief networks. behavior of the ELIS and CRS, A i must know enough about the subset of D D, that is relevant to h 5 such that it can
