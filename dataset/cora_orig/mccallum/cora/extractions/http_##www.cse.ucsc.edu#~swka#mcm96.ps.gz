Abstract: Measured Equation of Invariance(MEI) is a new concept in computational electromagnetics. It has been demonstrated that the MEI is such an efficient boundary truncation technique that the meshes can be terminated very close to the object and still strictly preserves the sparsity of the FD equations. Therefore, the final system matrix encountered by MEI is a sparse matrix with size similar to that of integral equation methods. However, complicated Green's function and disagreeable Sommerfeld integrals make the traditional MEI very difficult, if not impossible, to be applied to analyze multilayer and multiconductor interconnects. In this paper, we propose the Geometry Independent MEI(GIMEI) which substantially improved the original MEI method. We use GIMEI for capacitance extraction of general two-dimension VLSI multilayer and multiconductor interconnect. Numerical results are in good agreement with various published data. We also include a simple three-dimensional example and compared GIMEI with FASTCAP from MIT[1]. The accuracy is maintained while GIMEI are generally an order of magnitude faster than FASTCAP with much less memory usage.

Reference-contexts: Recent years, many methods have been applied to extract the interconnect parameters. They can be generally classified into two categories. One category is to solve differential Maxwell equations such as Finite Element method <ref> [2] </ref> (FE) and Finite Difference method (FD). They basically divide the space surrounding the object into meshes, then write local equations at each mesh point, which leads to a sparse matrix system.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the tedious deduction of Green's function in a multilayer structure, the calculation of the MEI coefficients is very time-consuming because many Sommerfeld type integrals will be encountered. The calculation of MEI coefficients dominates the total computation time. As reported in <ref> [8] </ref>, for a one-layer microstrip stub, obtaining the MEI coefficients required 90 CPU minutes for a single frequency, and solving the sparse system required 24 minutes on a Dec Station 5000 series 200.
