Pubnum: Technical Report 95/2  
Abstract: We present a polynomial-time algorithm based on continued fractions for computing the smallest set of linear inequalities that define the integer hull of a 2-D (planar) convex region R, given a set of linear inequalities defining R. By the integer hull of R we mean the smallest convex region containing all the integer points of R.

Suppose we wish to represent the real number X as a continued fraction. X can be written as a 1 + a 2 + 1 a 4 +::: where the a i are integers, and positive for i 2. This expression terminates exactly when X is rational. <p> If we construct a sequence of fractions containing all the odd principal conver-gents of X with their corresponding intermediate convergents (if such convergents exist), then the fraction we desire is the element of this sequence with the largest denominator no greater than D. Proof: See <ref> [2, Ch. 32 xx12-16] </ref>. 2 We can also use continued fractions to solve simple integer equalities of the form Ax + By = c, something we will need to do often later on. We assume in the following that both A and B are positive.

More than this, because we are only 4 working in two dimensions, it will be the same two variables for each inequality.
