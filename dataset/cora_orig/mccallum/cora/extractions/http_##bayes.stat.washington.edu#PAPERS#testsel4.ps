Abstract: Decision making under uncertainty typically requires an iterative process of information acquisition. At each stage, the decision maker chooses the next best test (or tests) to perform, and re-evaluates the possible decisions. Value-of-information analyses provide a formal strategy for selecting the next test(s). However, the complete decision-theoretic approach is impractical and researchers have sought approximations. In this paper, we present strategies for both myopic and limited non-myopic (working with known test groups) test selection in the context of belief networks. We focus primarily on utility-free test selection strategies. However, the methods have immediate application to the decision-theoretic framework.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Graphical belief network researchers have developed powerful algorithms to propagate the effects of any piece of information to all the variables in the model in a manner analogous to forward chaining in rule-based expert systems <ref> (see, for example, Dawid, 1992) </ref>. Comparatively little work has been done on the "backward chaining" problem: finding the most cost-effective information sources which will best increase information about a target variable. This is the Test Selection problem. <p> This property forms the basis of some simple search strategies in the belief network's "junction tree" and related Markov Tree models (Section 3.2). 1 A Berge network is a belief network with the property that clique intersections in the associated undirected graph <ref> (see Dawid, 1992) </ref> contain no more than one node. 3.1 Weight of evidence in Berge Networks and Markov Trees In a Berge network, the expected weight of evidence decreases in a monotone fashion away from the hypothesis, H (Madigan et al., 1994). <p> In a general non-Berge network we can either cluster the variables to form a Berge network, or transform the network into a Markov tree. 2 Many popular algorithms for calculating probabilities in belief networks already build a Markov tree <ref> (Dawid, 1992, Almond, 1995) </ref>. 2 A Markov tree is a tree whose nodes represent groups of variables and for which all the nodes Since Markov trees are always Berge networks, monotonicity holds in the Markov tree model.

Reference-contexts: Essentially, a myopic strategy continually shops around for bargains, when spending a little more freely may ultimately prove more cost effective <ref> (Glasziou and Hilden, 1989) </ref>. There are two challenges in going from myopic to non-myopic search. First, we must be able to calculate the joint expected weight of evidence of the test group, which gets computationally expensive as the size of the group increases (Section 4.1).

Reference-contexts: Recent proposed approaches for probabilistic belief networks include: Jensen and Liang (1994), Heckerman, et al. (1993), and Almond (1993). In this paper, we propose a semi-automated myopic strategy which synthesizes the critiquing approach of Miller (1983) and Good's idea of a quasi-utility <ref> (Good and Card, 1971) </ref>. We develop search strategies based on these ideas and demonstrate them in the context of a simple imaging application.

Reference-contexts: A similar observation is made in Jensen and Liang (1994). Unfortunately, in very large networks such as Pathfinder <ref> (Heckerman et al., 1992) </ref>, even these calculations are prohibitively expensive. The problem can be framed as a classical search problem looking for the most cost effective test.

Reference-contexts: Generally, we should only pursue a test if the information gained from the test is worth the cost of testing. If we have a full decision model (e.g., an influence diagram), then the preferred metric is the value of information <ref> (Matheson, 1990, provides a review) </ref>. For a purely probabilistic model, Good and Card (1971) suggest using a quasi-utility|a measure of information content which plays the role of a utility.

Reference-contexts: The artificial intelligence literature has discussed this problem at length-see, for example, Barr and Feigenbaum (1982, p.82). To address this problem, we adopt a "critiquing" approach <ref> (Miller, 1983) </ref>. The essential idea of critiquing is to elicit a suggested hypothesis from the user, say H = h 0 . The system then elicits indicants which are chosen to maximize the probability of quickly accepting or rejecting h 0 . <p> If the hypothesis is rejected, i.e., its probability falls below some defined threshold (Spiegel-halter and Knill-Jones, 1984), the user is prompted for an alternative suggestion, and so on <ref> (Miller, 1983, McSherry, 1986) </ref>.
