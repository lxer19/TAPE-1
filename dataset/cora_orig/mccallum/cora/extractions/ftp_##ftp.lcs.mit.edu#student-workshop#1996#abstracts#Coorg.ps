Reference-contexts: This sketch describes a novel algorithm that maintains a set of large occluders near the viewpoint, and uses the set to cull away occluded portions of the model. Full details of the algorithm are given in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 The Visibility Algorithm Our algorithm is based on several ideas. First, we propose a simple (and fast) visibility test that identifies whether some region of the model (typically a kD-tree node) is completely/partially occluded by a set of occluders. <p> Figure (b) shows supporting planes that are ignored for two connected occluders. into the algorithm in a straightforward way, by first checking whether the kD-tree node is inside the viewing frustum before invoking the visibility algorithm. Finally, the algorithm can be parallelized, yielding significant speedups <ref> [1] </ref>. If there are small "detail" objects present in the model, they are associated with the kD-tree node in which they are contained.
