Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of building large-scale geometric maps of indoor environments with mobile robots. It poses the map building problem as a constrained, probabilistic maximum-likelihood estimation problem. It then devises a practical algorithm for generating the most likely map from data, along with the most likely path taken by the robot. Experimental results in cyclic environments of size up to 80 by 25 meter illustrate the appropriateness of the approach.

Reference-contexts: For example, such landmarks might be Choset's meet points (Choset, 1996) (see also (Kuipers & Byun, 1991; Mataric, 1994)), which correspond to intersections or dead ends in corridors and which can be detected very robustly.

It is also assumed that the perceptual component is erroneousthe robot might misjudge the angle, distance, or type of landmark. 4 the corresponding map. <p> The lack of a landmark-recognizing routine is purely a limitation of our current implementation, not of the general algorithm. Recent research on landmark-based navigation has produced a large number of methods for recognizing specific landmarks (see, e.g., <ref> (Borenstein et al., 1996) </ref>). In particular, Choset's sensor-based covering algorithm (Choset, 1996) automatically detects and navigates to so-called meet-points. Meet-points correspond to intersections, corners, and dead-ends (see also (Kuipers & Byun, 1991)).

Reference-contexts: Thus, to build a single map, the robots have to determine their position relative to each other, i.e., there is a global localization problem. As noticed above, our approach is a generalization of Markov localization, which has been demonstrated to localize robots globally <ref> (Burgard et al., 1996) </ref>. To cope with multiple robots whose relative location is unknown, our basic approach has to be extended slightly. In particular, the initial position of the second robot relative to the first one is unknown.

Reference-contexts: Robot perception Our approach assumes that the robot can observe landmarks. More specifically, we assume that the robot is given a method for estimating the type, the relative angle and an approximate distance of nearby landmarks. For example, such landmarks might be Choset's meet points <ref> (Choset, 1996) </ref> (see also (Kuipers & Byun, 1991; Mataric, 1994)), which correspond to intersections or dead ends in corridors and which can be detected very robustly. Various other choices are described in (Borenstein et al., 1996). <p> Data was collected by joy-sticking the robot through its environment and using odometry (shaft encoders) to reverse-compute the corresponding control. While joy-sticking the robot, a human chose and marked a collection of significant locations in the robot's environment, which roughly corresponded to the meet-points described in <ref> (Choset, 1996) </ref>. These were used as landmarks. When the robot came across a landmark location, the human operator pushed a button. <p> Another possibility, which has not yet been implemented, would be to combine the current approach with Choset's sensor-based covering algorithm <ref> (Choset, 1996) </ref>. Our current implementation also relies on humans to identify landmarks. While this is reasonable when mapping an environment collaboratively with a human, it is impractical if the robot is to operate autonomously. <p> The lack of a landmark-recognizing routine is purely a limitation of our current implementation, not of the general algorithm. Recent research on landmark-based navigation has produced a large number of methods for recognizing specific landmarks (see, e.g., (Borenstein et al., 1996)). In particular, Choset's sensor-based covering algorithm <ref> (Choset, 1996) </ref> automatically detects and navigates to so-called meet-points. Meet-points correspond to intersections, corners, and dead-ends (see also (Kuipers & Byun, 1991)).

Reference-contexts: Following (Koenig & Simmons, 1996; Shatkay & Kaelbling, 1997a), the high-dimensional maximum likelihood estimation problem is solved efficiently using the Baum-Welch (or alpha-beta) algorithm (Rabiner & Juang, 1986), which is a special version of EM <ref> (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977) </ref>. Baum-Welch alternates an expectation step (E-step) and a maximization step (M-step, sometimes also called modification step). In the E-step, the current map is held constant and the probability distributions are calculated for past and current robot locations. <p> In the light of these numbers, finding the map that globally maximizes the likelihood function appears to be difficult. Fortunately, there exists an efficient and well-understood technique for hill-climbing in likelihood space: the EM algorithm <ref> (Dempster et al., 1977) </ref>, which in the context of Hidden Markov Models is often referred to as Baum-Welch or alpha-beta algorithm (Rabiner & Juang, 1986) (for applications of alpha-beta in the context of mapping see (Koenig & Simmons, 1996; Shatkay & Kaelbling, 1997a; Oore, Hinton, & Dudek, 1997)).

Reference-contexts: In more than 18.5km of autonomous robot navigation in a densely crowded environment (top speed 80 cm/sec, average speed 36 cm/sec), Markov localization was absolutely essential for the robot's safety and success <ref> (Fox et al., 1997) </ref>. The method proposed here directly extends this approach. In future installations of the tour-guide robot, maps do not have to be crafted manually but can now be generated by joy-sticking a robot through its environment.

Reference-contexts: This is important to us since in the past we have frequently installed robots at various sites, often at conferences, where time pressure prohibits modeling environments by hand. We conjecture that similar time savings can be achieved in installing robots in other indoor environments, such as hospitals <ref> (King & Weiman, 1990) </ref>. 8. Suitability for collaborative multi-robot mapping Multi-robot collaboration is a topic that is currently gaining significant attention in the scientific community (see e.g., (Mataric, 1997; Parker, 1996)). A sub-problem of multi-robot collaboration is multi-robot map acquisition (Lopez & Sierra, 1997).

To the best of our knowledge, the topic of collaborative multi-robot mapping has previously only been studied by Lopez and colleagues <ref> (Lopez & Sierra, 1997) </ref>. Like ours, their approach models the uncertainty of a robot's location explicitly, and it also takes this uncertainty into account when building maps. However, their approach lacks a method for localization.

Reference-contexts: Related work Over the last decade, there has been a flurry of work on map building for mobile robots (see e.g., (Chatila & Laumond, 1985; Leonard, Durrant-Whyte, & Cox, 1992; Rencken, 1993; Thrun, 1998)). As noticed by Lu and Milios <ref> (Lu & Milios, 1997) </ref>, the dominating paradigm in the field is incremental: Robot locations are estimated as they occur; the majority of approaches lacks the ability to use sensor data for revising past location estimates. A detailed survey of recent literature on map building can be found in (Thrun, 1998). <p> Oore and colleagues applied an EM-based algorithm to a related problem, in which a robot learned to associate sensor input with poses (Oore et al., 1997) (see also (Thrun, in press)).

Their approach is incapable of representing ambiguities and multi-modal densities. <p> Their approach is incapable of representing ambiguities and multi-modal densities. It can only compensate a limited amount of odometric error in x-y-- space, due to the requirement of a sufficient overlap between scans <ref> (Lu & Milios, 1997) </ref>. In all cases studied in (Gutmann, 1996; Lu & Milios, 1997), the odometric error was an order of magnitude smaller than the one reported here. In addition, the approach is largely specific to robots equipped with laser range finders.

Reference-contexts: Likelihood is maximized under probabilistic constraints that arise from the physics of robot motion and perception. Following (Koenig & Simmons, 1996; Shatkay & Kaelbling, 1997a), the high-dimensional maximum likelihood estimation problem is solved efficiently using the Baum-Welch (or alpha-beta) algorithm <ref> (Rabiner & Juang, 1986) </ref>, which is a special version of EM (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977).

EM is a hill-climbing routine in likelihood space which alternates two steps, an expectation step (E-step) and a maximization step (M-step). <p> The reader should notice that our definition of ff (t) and fi (t) deviates from the definition usually given in the literature on Hidden Markov Models (c.f., <ref> (Rabiner & Juang, 1986) </ref>). However, our definition maps nicely into existing localization paradigms. <p> The M-step computes the most likely map under the assumption that ff (t) fi (t) accurately reflects the likelihood that the robot was at ~ (t) at time t.

Reference-contexts: One of the environments contains a cycle of size 60 by 25 meter, which has been mapped successfully despite significant odometric error. The approach has been integrated with a conventional method for building occupancy grid maps <ref> (Thrun, 1993, 1998) </ref>, for which results are reported as well. Related work is reviewed in Section 9. 2. The probabilistic model This section describes our probabilistic model of the two basic aspects involved in mapping: motion and perception.

Reference-contexts: Figure 6b shows an occupancy grid map constructed from sonar measurements (using a ring of 24 Polaroid sonar sensors), using the guessed maximum likelihood positions as input to the mapping software described in <ref> (Thrun, 1998) </ref>. In comparison, Figure 5b shows the same map using the raw, uncorrected data. The map constructed from raw data is not usable for navigation, whereas the corrected map is sufficient for our current navigation software (see (Thrun et al., 1998) for a description of the navigation routines). <p> In comparison, Figure 5b shows the same map using the raw, uncorrected data. The map constructed from raw data is not usable for navigation, whereas the corrected map is sufficient for our current navigation software (see <ref> (Thrun et al., 1998) </ref> for a description of the navigation routines). Figures 7 to 11 show the map at different stages of the data collection. Figure 7 shows results for mapping the small cycle in the environment. <p> During those tours, it traversed approximately 18.5 km at an average speed of approximately 36.6 cm/sec. The reliability of the robot in reaching its destination was 99.75% (averaged over 2,400 tour goals). One of the bottlenecks of this installation was the requirement for accurate maps. Our navigation software <ref> (Thrun et al., 1998) </ref> requires highly accurate maps for reliable navigation. 16 (c) the maximum likelihood map is always topologically correct. <p> A detailed survey of recent literature on map building can be found in <ref> (Thrun, 1998) </ref>. The approach proposed there, however, is also incremental and therefore incapable of dealing with situations such as the ones described in this paper. 22 Recently, several groups have proposed algorithms that revise estimates backwards in time. <p> The inverse sensor model (also called sensor interpretation), which is employed in the map building step (M-step), can be realized by the approach described in <ref> (Thrun, 1998) </ref>, where neural networks are used to extract occupancy grid maps from sensor data. As a result, proximity sensor readings would be directly incorporated in the position estimation, thereby obliviating the need for landmarks. The extension of the current approach to other sensor models is subject to future work.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the approach can be combined with one of the known sensor-based exploration techniques. We have already integrated the approach with our previously developed algorithm for greedy occupancy-grid-based exploration described in (Thrun, 1993; Buhmann et al., 1995) (see also <ref> (Yamauchi & Beer, 1996) </ref>); however, no systematic results are available at this point in time. Another possibility, which has not yet been implemented, would be to combine the current approach with Choset's sensor-based covering algorithm (Choset, 1996). Our current implementation also relies on humans to identify landmarks.
