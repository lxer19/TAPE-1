Title: Qualitative and Quantitative Reasoning About Thermodynamics  
Author: Gordon Skorstad and Ken Forbus 
Affiliation: Qualitative Reasoning Group Beckman Institute, University of Illinois  
Abstract: One goal of qualitative physics is to capture the mental models of engineers and scientists. This paper shows how Qualitative Process theory can be used to express concepts of engineering thermodynamics. This encoding provides the means to integrate qualitative and quantitative knowledge for solving textbook thermodynamics problems. These ideas have been implemented in a program called SCHISM, which analyzes thermodynamic cycles, such as gas turbine plants and steam power plants. We describe its analysis of a sample textbook problem and discuss our plans for future work.

Reference-contexts: For example, "keywords in the [problem] statement" have been conjectured as the basis for ignoring variables or setting their values to zero <ref> [1] </ref>, which in SCHISM falls out through qualitative analysis. Further psychological studies might reveal a novice-expert shift, with novices using surface features and experts relying on a generative qualitative analysis [4]. Proceedings of CogSci89 At present SCHISM has been successfully tested on three examples, all from Chapter One of [13].

Reference-contexts: The initial motivation for qualitative physics was to set up and guide the solution of textbook motion problems [6]. Since then, research has mainly focused on purely qualitative reasoning <ref> [2] </ref>, and significant progress has been made. We believe the time is right to begin exploring the integration of qualitative and quantitative reasoning again. In particular, our long-range goal is to develop a system which can automatically perform engineering analyses of thermodynamic systems in a human-like way.

Reference-contexts: The final expression for the goal quantity is found by solving the set of equations via substitution. SCHISM's symbolic math package includes a canonical rational function manipulator to perform simplification of most mathematical expressions. The isolation, collection and attraction methods of Bundy <ref> [3] </ref> are used for extracting variables from equations. 5 AN EXAMPLE The following example is taken from [13]. In the text, Haywood introduces the steam plant shown in figure 5 by describing its parts, structure and qualitative behavior.

Reference-contexts: The contained stuff ontology [12], used in our model, provides a natural partioning of an apparatus into macroscopic control volumes. "The coolant in the room coils of the refrigerator" is an example of a contained stuff. Our Molecular Collection (MC) ontology <ref> [5] </ref>, which follows an infinitesimal piece of fluid through an apparatus, provides another useful control volume. An MC may be viewed as a closed control volume since its mass does not change. The MC control volume lets us describe properties of a fluid at a point in space.

Reference-contexts: Developing a correct qualitative understanding of the problem is essential to solving complex problems. Qualitative physics should provide the foundation for a more complete, formal account of human mental models, including how qualitative and quantitative knowledge interact. This paper shows how Qualitative Process theory <ref> [8] </ref> can be used to encode fundamental concepts of engineering thermodynamics. This qualitative knowledge is used for problem solving in several ways. Qualitative simulation is used to verify that questions make sense by ensuring that the behavior mentioned can actually occur. The simulation also provides a framework for extracting equations.

Reference-contexts: Isometric, isobaric, and isothermal processes can be recognized by noting the sign of the appropriate derivative. Adiabatic processes can be recognized by the absence of active heat flow processes between the system and its environment. 1 QPE is an envisioner for QP theory. For details see <ref> [9] </ref>. Proceedings of CogSci89 2.7 POINT AND PATH QUANTITIES Thermodynamics distinguishes between path-independent and path-dependent parameters. Path-independent parameters, also known as point properties or state functions of a substance, include temperature, pressure and volume. They can be determined directly from the current values of other parameters.

Reference-contexts: Studies of textbook problem solving have tended to focus on quantitative reasoning [1,4,14,15]. We begin instead with the view that qualitative models are the starting point for the accumulation and use of more sophisticated, quantitative models. This view is widely held in the mental models literature <ref> [11] </ref>, and widely but less formally in the engineering community [16,17]. In problem-solving, the analysis begins by constructing a qualitative understanding of the situation. This initial understanding provides the framework for further analyses, such as deriving and solving sets of equations.

Reference-contexts: Isolated systems exchange neither mass nor energy with their surroundings. Control volumes in a QP model correspond to individuals with the quantity volume, and contiguous collections of such individuals. The contained stuff ontology <ref> [12] </ref>, used in our model, provides a natural partioning of an apparatus into macroscopic control volumes. "The coolant in the room coils of the refrigerator" is an example of a contained stuff.

Reference-contexts: In such systems, fluid continuously passes around a closed loop. Closed cycles are of great practical importance since they form the basis of heating, cooling and power generation systems. Indeed, whole books are written about the analysis of such systems <ref> [13] </ref>. Closed cycles are the first class of systems we have chosen for automated analysis by SCHISM. The MC ontology provides a simple way to detect closed cycles, since a closed cycle directly corresponds to a cycle in the MC envisionment. <p> SCHISM's symbolic math package includes a canonical rational function manipulator to perform simplification of most mathematical expressions.

Our plan is to continue working through the textbook, seeing how much of it we can master by augmenting the set of equations and domain model as necessary. An interesting question we hope to answer is how large a role each kind of knowledge plays in mastering these problems.
