Reference-contexts: In other words StretchTools preserves the up, down, left and right ordering of points. Topology Transformation induced by StretchTools is a homeomor-phism because it preserves "open sets" in the topological sense uses (see <ref> [1] </ref>). An important consequence is that, the transformation maps the inside of a closed continuous curve to the inside of a closed continuous curve as demonstrated by Figures 5, 6, and 7.

Reference-contexts: This is the most important contribution of StretchTools. Additionally, a transformation must preserve sufficient similarity between the original layout and the transformed layout to minimize viewer-disorientation. In <ref> [2] </ref> Eades, Lai, Misue and Sugiyama list a number of properties of layouts properties which should be preserved by transformations in order to preserve the "mental map" of the viewer. They include three properties, orthogonal ordering , topology and clusters.

Reference-contexts: The display is a combination of a detailed view of the strip and two distorted views, where items on either side of the detailed view are squashed horizontally into narrow vertical strips. In a CHI '86 paper, Furnas pioneered the Fisheye Lens <ref> [4] </ref> which shows the nearby regions of the focus in detail while still showing remote regions in successively less detail. Later at CHI '92, Sarkar and Brown generalized the concept and demonstrated a prototype Fisheye Lens browser for large graphs [8].

Reference-contexts: Later at CHI '92, Sarkar and Brown generalized the concept and demonstrated a prototype Fisheye Lens browser for large graphs [8]. Earlier at CHI '91, Mackinlay, Robertson and Card developed a technique called the Perspective Wall which uses 3D interactive animation for visualizing linear information <ref> [5] </ref>. Perspective Wall has a center panel for detail and two side panels receding into the distance for context. In this paper, we present a novel technique of directly manipulating the screen space. The user interface uses the metaphor of stretching a rubber sheet. <p> Louis. Next in Figure 10 Salt Lake City has been enlarged, now both St. Louis and Salt Lake City can be seen in detail. Finally a cluster of cities in the northeastern United States is shown in detail in Figure 11. Like Fisheye Lens [8] and Perspective Wall <ref> [5] </ref>, StretchTools allows viewers to visualize the entire structure in one window. It smoothly integrates context with detail. The advantage of StretchTools over other techniques is that it allows the user to precisely control the space allocation. The metaphor of stretching a rubber sheet is very intuitive.

Reference-contexts: The other approach to managing size is abstraction. In [7] Paulisch and Tichy present two abstraction techniques called graph abstraction and edge concentration for dealing with large graphs. At CHI '92 Mills, Cohen and Wong described a practical tool for visualizing video data <ref> [6] </ref>. Their system also takes the approach of hierarchical abstraction for managing size. It may be worthwhile to combine the two approaches.

Reference-contexts: Every part of the layout computes the detail to be displayed based on the screen space available to itself. Detail computation can be arbitrarily complex. For example, it can be as complex as graph abstraction as in <ref> [7] </ref> or as simple as font size determination. <p> Also neither of these techniques have any natural way of viewing multiple objects at the same time. The techniques such as StretchTools, Fisheye Lens and Perspective Wall manage size of the information bases by mainly distorting the layout. The other approach to managing size is abstraction.

At CHI '92 Mills, Cohen and Wong described a practical tool for visualizing video data [6]. Their system also takes the approach of hierarchical abstraction for managing size.

Reference-contexts: As early as in 1982, Spence and Apperley developed a technique called the Bifocal Display for visualizing office information <ref> [9] </ref>. Briefly, in their system the workspace is a set of information items positioned in a horizontal strip. The display is a combination of a detailed view of the strip and two distorted views, where items on either side of the detailed view are squashed horizontally into narrow vertical strips.
