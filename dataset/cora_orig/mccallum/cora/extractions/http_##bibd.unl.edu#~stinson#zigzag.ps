Abstract: Some Results on Nonlinear Zigzag Functions Abstract In this paper, we begin an investigation of general (linear or nonlinear) zigzag functions. In particular, we prove some bounds (i.e., necessary conditions for existence of zigzag functions) which generalize known bounds for linear zigzag functions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Definitions Zigzag functions were defined by Brassard, Crepeau and Santha <ref> [1] </ref>. We review basic concepts and definitions now. Let F q denote the finite field with q elements. Suppose that f : (F q ) n ! (F q ) m , where n &gt; m. Let I f1; : : :; ng. <p> An [n; m] q-ary code C is said to be intersecting if, for every x; y 2 C such that x; y 6= (0; : : :; 0), supp (x) " supp (y) 6= ;. The following result, first proved in <ref> [1] </ref>, says that linear zigzags are equivalent, in a strong sense, to intersecting codes. We provide a proof using Lemma 2.2. Theorem 2.3 Let M be an mfin matrix with entries from F q . <p> Therefore C is an intersecting code. Various interesting results on linear zigzag functions can be obtained by invoking known results on intersecting codes, which are studied in <ref> [7, 9, 3, 10, 4, 1] </ref>, for example. The best (asymptotic) necessary condition for the existence of linear zigzag functions follows from the observation that an intersecting [n; m] q-ary code has minimum distance at least m, together with the MRRW bound ([8, Ch. 17]). <p> We provide a table summarizing known results on n fl L (m) and n fl (m). Of course it is always the case that n fl L (m) n fl (m). The values in Table 1 in the column "linear zigzag" are all taken from <ref> [1] </ref>. 4.1 The Nonexistence of an (8; 4; 2)-ZF The case m = 4 is an interesting one. It was previously known that a (linear) (9; 4; 2)-ZF exists, and no linear (8; 4; 2)-ZF exists. <p> We consider two cases, depending on the value of d. 7 Table 1: Results on the minimum n such that an (n; m; 2)-ZF exists m linear zigzag arbitrary zigzag <ref> [1] </ref> Theorem 3.8 exact values 2 n fl 3 n fl 4 n fl 5 n fl 6 n fl 7 n fl 8 n fl 9 n fl 4.1.1 Case 1: d 4 The punctured code is a (7; 16; 3) code, which is perfect. (It has the same parameters <p> case, the constant 3:5277 is computed as 1=ffi, where ffi :28347 is the solution to the equation ffi = h 1 ffi (1 ffi) ; where h is the binary entropy function defined as h (x) = x log 2 x (1 x) log 2 (1 x): 5 Summary In <ref> [1] </ref>, the authors ask if there is any parameter situation where there exists a nonlinear zigzag function, but no linear zigzag function exists. Although we have not been able to answer this question, we have generalized several bounds on linear zigzag functions to the general (nonlinear) case.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 4.1 There does not exist an (8; 4; 2)-ZF. 9 4.2 An Asymptotic Bound Our last result is an asymptotic lower bound on n fl (m), obtained by appealing to Corollary 3.4 in conjunction with the MRRW bound for orthogonal arrays <ref> [2, Theorem 3.5] </ref>. The result is the following. Theorem 4.2 lim inf n fl (m) &gt; 3:5277: Theorem 4.2 extends the result proved in the linear case in [7] (this is the result mentioned at the end of Section 2) to the nonlinear case.

Reference-contexts: Corollary 3.6 If q m 1 and m 2, then there does not exist a (2m 1; m; q)-ZF. Proof. The Bush bound for orthogonal arrays (see, for example, <ref> [5, p. 180] </ref>), states that if an OA 1 (t; k; q) exists with q t, then k t + 1. Hence, if a (2m 1; m; q)-ZF exists with q m 1, then 2m 1 m, or m 1. Since m 2, we have a contradiction. <p> Applying the classical Rao bound for orthogonal arrays (see, for example, <ref> [5, p. 180] </ref>), the following is obtained. Theorem 3.8 Suppose there exists an (n; m; q)-ZF.

Reference-contexts: We give an alternative way to define the unbiased concept, which is based on the approach used in [11] and <ref> [6] </ref> to study correlation-immune and resilient functions. For any y 2 (F q ) m , define A y to be the array whose rows consist of all the n-tuples in f 1 (y). <p> Since n = 2m 1, it follows that f is a (2m 1; m; q)-ZF. Remark A (2m1; m; q)-ZF is equivalent to a (2m1; m; m1; q)-resilient function (see <ref> [6, Theorem 5.2] </ref>). We can use the above theorem to obtain necessary conditions for the existence of zigzag functions with n = 2m 1. Corollary 3.6 If q m 1 and m 2, then there does not exist a (2m 1; m; q)-ZF. Proof.

Reference-contexts: 4.1.1 Case 1: d 4 The punctured code is a (7; 16; 3) code, which is perfect. (It has the same parameters as a Hamming code, but recall that we are not assuming that it is linear.) This code is distance invariant, and its weight and distance distributions coincide (see <ref> [8, Ch. 6] </ref>). It can be shown that, in C, every codeword is at distance eight from exactly one codeword and at distance four from all other codewords.
