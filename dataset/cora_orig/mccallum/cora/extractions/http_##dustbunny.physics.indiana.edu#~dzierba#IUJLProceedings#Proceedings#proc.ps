Abstract: One of the major considerations in planning photoproduction experiments is the choice of technique for generating the photon beam. Several possibilities exist, chiefly Compton-backscattered laser beams, tagged and untagged bremsstrahlung, and coherent bremsstrahlung from a crystal. In a coherent bremsstrahlung beam, collimation can be used to suppress the incoherent component and to narrow the energy spread of the coherent photon spectrum, producing beams with monochromatic peaks of only 1-2% r.m.s. width and high flux and polarization. The potential and limitations of this technique for use in photoproduction experiments at 8GeV and above are discussed in this report.
