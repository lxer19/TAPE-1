Reference-contexts: Input units are linear and all others - are sigmoidal. The 234 inputs represent 9 frames of ceps ra, delta cepstra, log energy, and delta log energy speech features as described in Section 5 and <ref> [9] </ref>. The training of the hybrid system is described else-t where in this volume [2]. To summarize, the MLP is rained using stochastic gradient descent and a relative-d entropy error criterion.

To summarize, the MLP is rained using stochastic gradient descent and a relative-d entropy error criterion. The 1 of N target distribution is efined as 1 for the output index corresponding to the e correct phone class label and 0 otherwise. <p> Frame - classification performance on an independent cross alidation set is used to control the learning rate and d decide when to halt training. Learning rate is controlle s in Cohen <ref> [2] </ref>. The hybrid system is bootstrapped from the pure e HMM DECIPHER system [10]. Target labels for th LP outputs, representing each of 69 context-independent i phone classes, are obtained from the HMM forced-Viterb lignments.
