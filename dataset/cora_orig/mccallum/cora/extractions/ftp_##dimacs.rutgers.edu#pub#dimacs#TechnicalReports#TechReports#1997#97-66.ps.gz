Reference-contexts: Let F be a family of more than n2 convex sets in the plane satisfying property P 3 . Projecting these sets onto the x-axis, we obtain a system of intervals I. A well-known result of Gallai (see <ref> [B] </ref>, p.373) implies that I has more than n2 elements that are either pairwise disjoint or all of them have a point in common.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In their classical paper [ES1], Erd-os and Szekeres proved that any set of more than n2 points in general position in the plane contains n points which are in convex position, i.e., they form the vertex set of a convex n-gon. T. Bisztriczky and G. Fejes Toth <ref> [BF1] </ref>, [F] extended this result to families of convex sets.

Reference-contexts: T. Bisztriczky and G. Fejes Toth proved that there exists a function P (n) such that if jF j &gt; P (n) and any three members of F are in convex position, then F has n members in convex position. Improving their initial result, in <ref> [BF2] </ref> they showed that this statement is true with a function P (n), triply exponential in n. <p> Property P n k means that both P k and P n are satisfied. Using these notions, Theorem 1 states that if a family F satisfies property P n 3 , then jF j n2 . T. Bisztriczky and G. Fejes Toth <ref> [BF2] </ref> raised the following more general question. <p> We use this statement to establish the following result, whose part (ii) was proved in <ref> [BF2] </ref>. Lemma 2.2. <p> If A is not a vertex, then it is said to be an internal member of F . Lemma 3.1 <ref> [BF2] </ref> Let k 4 and let F be a family of pairwise disjoint convex sets in the plane satisfying property P k . <p> Then F is in convex position. Proof. Case (ii) was settled by Bisztriczky and Fejes Toth <ref> [BF2] </ref>. So we have to prove the assertion only in case (i). Let A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A t denote the members of F listed from left to the right.

Reference-contexts: A complete graph, whose edges are arbitrarily oriented, is called a tournament. An acyclic tournament is said to be transitive. Lemma 2.1 <ref> [CK] </ref> Let T be a transitive tournament with more than n2 vertices, and let f be any real-valued function defined on its edge set.
