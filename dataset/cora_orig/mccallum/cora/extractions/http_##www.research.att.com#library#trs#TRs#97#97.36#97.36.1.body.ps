Abstract: Summary. We investigate the existence and implications of competitive equilibria when two firms offer the same electronic goods under different pricing policies. One charges a fixed subscription fee per period; the other charges on a per-use basis. Two models are examined when firms' marginal costs are negligible and they can revise prices periodically. Both show that competition often leads to ruinous price wars in the absence of collusion. However, stable pricing equilibria exist in special cases. The findings are robust even when customers are willing to pay a fixed-subscription premium.

We verify three other properties of f 2 : <ref> [1] </ref> f 2 (p) &lt; p for p &gt; 0; 2 (0) = 1=r, where r &gt; 1 is the unique positive solution to ln (r + 1) = (r + 1) 2 when k = 2 ; (11) 1 k 2 2k 1 (r + 1) + 1 = (k <p> where r &gt; 1 is the unique positive solution to ln (r + 1) = (r + 1) 2 when k = 2 ; (11) 1 k 2 2k 1 (r + 1) + 1 = (k 1)(k 2) when k &gt; 2 ; (12) [3] r &lt; 1 Property <ref> [1] </ref> says that f 2 stays to the left of the 45 ffi line on Figure 3. Property [3] shows that the slope of f 2 (viewed in the usual Cartesian orientation) is less than the slope of f 1 at the origin. <p> Because the equilibrium point is unique, there is exactly one point above the origin at which f 1 and f 2 cross (our case) or touch without crossing. Property <ref> [1] </ref> is proved as follows. <p> We have p n &lt; 1 by (9) for all n, and q n &lt; p n by <ref> [1] </ref> for all n. As long as 1 2 &lt; q n , p n+1 &lt; q n . After a finite number of iterations, which depends on q 0 and k, p n is sufficiently close to 1 2 so that q n &lt; 1 2 . <p> The simplest examples of a price war in the normalized bounded case of (w; x) 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 are f (w; x) = 1, f (w; x) = wx, and f (w; x) = c (1 wx). An unbounded example is f (w; x) = c 1 c 2 e c 1 wc 2 x .
