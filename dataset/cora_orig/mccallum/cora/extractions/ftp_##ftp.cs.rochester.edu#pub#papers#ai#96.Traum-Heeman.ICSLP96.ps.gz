Abstract: Defining an utterance unit in spoken dialogue has remained a difficult issue. To shed light on this question, we consider grounding behavior in dialogue, and examine co-occurrencesbetween turn-initial grounding acts and utterance unit signals that have been proposed in the literal, namely prosodic boundary tones and pauses. Preliminary results indicate high correlation between grounding and boundary tones, with a secondary correlation for longer pauses.

Reference-contexts: For spoken dialogue it has often been claimed that utterances rather than sentences are the primary object of study [2, 3]. But just what are utterances? Following Bloomfield <ref> [1] </ref>, the term utterance has often been vaguely defined as an act of speech. However, action comes in many different types and sizes.

Reference-contexts: In the next section, we discuss grounding behavior and the types of relationships between successive turns. Section 3 includes a description of our corpus and conventions for marking prominent features. Results of this study is presented in 4. 2. GROUNDING AND RELATEDNESS Clark and Schaefer <ref> [4] </ref> call the process of adding to common ground between conversants grounding. They present a model of grounding in conversation, in which contributions are composed of two phases, presentations and acceptances.

Reference-contexts: TCUs may consist of differing types of syntactic contributions, including lexical, phrasal, clausal, and sentential constructions. Much subsequent work on turn-taking (e.g., <ref> [5, 11, 6] </ref>) has tried to analyze what features are used to signal a TRP. The features that were examined included syntactic completions, pauses, and various prosodic features including boundary tones.

Reference-contexts: Analysts have proposed many different definitions of utterances and utterance units. The turn is the unit of dialogue that has most often been proposed for study as a basic utterance unit. Fries <ref> [7] </ref>, for example, uses the term utterance unit to denote those chunks of talk that are marked off by a shift of speaker.

Reference-contexts: First, we consider Pierre-humbert's intonation phrase (IP) [12]. Full IP's are terminated by a boundary tone (labeled %).

Reference-contexts: The features that were examined included syntactic completions, pauses, and various prosodic features including boundary tones. In looking at the relationship of prosody to discourse structure, Nakajima and Allen <ref> [10] </ref> used four principles to segment turns into utterance units: utterance units correspond to sentences of text, they can correspond to basic speech acts, they are at most a single turn, and they can be marked with a pause of at least 750 msec.

Reference-contexts: The turn is the unit of dialogue that has most often been proposed for study as a basic utterance unit. Fries [7], for example, uses the term utterance unit to denote those chunks of talk that are marked off by a shift of speaker. Some authors (e.g., <ref> [11] </ref>) also distinguish speaking-turns in which new information is conveyed from backchannel items, which are short responses such fl Funding for the second author was gratefully received from NSF under Grant IRI-90-13160 and from ONR/DARPA under Grant N00014-92-J-1512. <p> TCUs may consist of differing types of syntactic contributions, including lexical, phrasal, clausal, and sentential constructions.

Reference-contexts: This corpus totaled over 6000 seconds of spoken dialogue, comprising 1366 turn transitions. 3.1. Prosodic Markings We mark two kinds of prosodic information which has been used as indication of utterance unit boundaries. First, we consider Pierre-humbert's intonation phrase (IP) <ref> [12] </ref>. Full IP's are terminated by a boundary tone (labeled %). Partial phrases are anything from the last complete IP to the beginning of speech by the new speaker.

Reference-contexts: Instead, they use moves and acts as the basic single-speaker components of exchanges. A single turn might consist of several different moves, which might be part of different exchanges. Sacks et. al, <ref> [13] </ref> present a theory of the organization of turns as composed of turn-constructional units (TCUs). <p> For the overlap cases, we looked for a boundary tone on the last complete word before the overlapping speech occurred. The distribution of the overlaps into tone and no-tone categories is still somewhat problematic, due to the potential projectability of IP boundaries <ref> [13] </ref>: a new speaker may judge that the end of a unit is coming up and merely anticipate (perhaps incorrectly) the occurrence of a tone.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, if the new speaker does not come in right away, the first speaker may produce several basic contributions within the span of a single turn. From a purely functional point of view, many analysts have found the turn too large a unit for convenient analysis. Sinclair and Coulthard <ref> [14] </ref>, for example, found that their basic unit of interaction, the exchange, cut across individual turns. Instead, they use moves and acts as the basic single-speaker components of exchanges. A single turn might consist of several different moves, which might be part of different exchanges.

Reference-contexts: These include feedback words such as ok, right, and mm-hm, repetition of the previous content, and initiation of a next relevant contribution. Completions and repairs of presentations of the contributor also play a role in the grounding process. Traum and Allen <ref> [15] </ref> built on this work, presenting a speech acts approach to grounding, in which utterances are seen as actions affecting the state of grounding of contributed material. <p> Fully 80% of utterance display grounding behavior, while another 15% occur in positions in which (according to the theory in <ref> [15] </ref> further grounding is unnecessary. It is only in 3-5% of turn transitions in which a lack of orientation to the contributions of the other speaker is displayed. 4.2.
