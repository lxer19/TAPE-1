Abstract: Clustering in data mining is a discovery process that groups a set of data such that the intracluster similarity is maximized and the intercluster similarity is minimized. These discovered clusters are used to explain the characteristics of the data distribution. In this paper we propose a new methodology for clustering related items using association rules, and clustering related transactions using clusters of items. Our approach is linearly scalable with respect to the number of transactions. The frequent item-sets used to derive association rules are also used to group items into a hypergraph edge, and a hypergraph partitioning algorithm is used to find the clusters. Our experiments indicate that clustering using association rule hypergraphs holds great promise in several application domains. Our experiments with stock-market data and congressional voting data show that this clustering scheme is able to successfully group items that belong to the same group. Clustering of items can also be used to cluster the transactions containing these items. Our experiments with congressional voting data show that this method is quite effective in finding clusters of transactions that correspond to either democrat or republican voting patterns. Compared to the existing clustering algorithm Autoclass, our algorithm produced comparable quality clusters in the congressional voting data. fl This work was supported by NSF grant ASC-9634719, Army Research Office contract DA/DAAH04-95-1-0538, Cray Research Inc.

Reference-contexts: Consider for instance the items that are sold in a grocery store. If we can cluster these items into item-groups that are often sold together, we can then use this knowledge to perform effective shelf-space organization as well as target sales promotions. The association rules <ref> [AMS + 96, HF95, HKK97] </ref> discovered in transaction databases can be used as clusters of items. However, this will lead to a very large number of clusters, each containing a small number of items. Hence, the knowledge that can be extracted out of these clusters is relatively fine grain. <p> In this paper we propose a new methodology for clustering related items using association rules, and clustering related transactions using clusters of items. Frequent item-sets, that are used to derive association rules, are sets of items of the database that meet a minimum support criterion <ref> [AMS + 96] </ref>. These frequent item-sets are used to group items into hypergraph edges, and a hypergraph partitioning algorithm [KAKS97] is used to find the clusters. <p> Our algorithm is linearly scalable with respect to the number of transactions in the data base. The first step of our method, finding frequent item-sets, has been experimentally shown to be linearly scalable in <ref> [AMS + 96] </ref>. Once a hypergraph is constructed from the frequent item-sets, the remaining steps are independent of the number of transactions. The run time of the hypergraph partitioning depends only on the number of vertices and hyperedges. <p> The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed clustering techniques. Section 3 contains discussion and future works. 2 Clustering Based on Association Rules The frequent item-sets <ref> [AMS + 96] </ref> found in transaction databases often reveal hidden relationships and correlations among data items. Association rule discovery in data mining has been used to discover such relationships in very large data repositories. <p> Our algorithm is linearly scalable with respect to the number of transactions in the data base. The first step of our method, finding frequent item-sets, has been experimentally shown to be linearly scalable in <ref> [AMS + 96] </ref>. Once a hypergraph is constructed from the frequent item-sets, the remaining steps are independent of the number of transactions.

Reference-contexts: A hypergraph <ref> [Ber76] </ref> H = (V; E) consists of a set of vertices (V ) and a set of hyperedges (E). A hypergraph is an extension of a graph in the sense that each hyperedge can connect more than two vertices.

Reference-contexts: Frequent item-sets, that are used to derive association rules, are sets of items of the database that meet a minimum support criterion [AMS + 96]. These frequent item-sets are used to group items into hypergraph edges, and a hypergraph partitioning algorithm <ref> [KAKS97] </ref> is used to find the clusters. The knowledge that is represented by clusters of related items can also be used to effectively cluster the actual transactions by looking at the clusters that these transactions belong to. <p> In our preliminary experiments, we used HMETIS <ref> [KAKS97] </ref> to partition this hypergraph. HMETIS is a multi-level partitioning algorithm that has been shown to quickly produce high quality partitions (i.e., the sum of the weights that straddle partitions is minimized). HMETIS produces balanced k-way partitions, where k (i.e., the number of partitions) is specified by the user.

Clustering of transaction could be particularly useful in classifying users according to their behavior, such as the buying patterns of customers in supermarkets or client access patterns in a web-based environment <ref> [MJHS96] </ref>. 2.1 Clustering of Data Items Our method finds the clusters of items by constructing a weighted hypergraph from the frequent item-sets and partitioning this hypergraph using some similarity criteria related to the confidence of the association rules of these frequent item-sets.

Reference-contexts: A transaction belongs to the cluster which has the highest score with respect to that transaction. We performed clustering of transactions on 1984 United States Congressional Voting Records Database provided by <ref> [MM96] </ref>. The data set includes 435 transactions each corresponding to one Congressman's votes on 16 key issues. We removed class values from each transaction, and we followed the steps specified in Section 2.1 to generate the clusters of items. These clusters are shown in Table 2.
