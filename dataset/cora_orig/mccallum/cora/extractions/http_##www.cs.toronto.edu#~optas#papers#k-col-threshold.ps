Abstract: Let f k (n; p) denote the probability that the random graph G(n; p) is k-colorable. We show that for every k 3, there exists d k (n) such that for any * &gt; 0, As a result we conclude that for any given value of n the the chromatic number of G(n; d=n) is concentrated in one value for all but a small fraction of d &gt; 1. In particular, this fraction tends to 0 as n tends to infinity.

Reference-contexts: It is not difficult to see that the two point width of the concentration interval is best possible for general p. Finally, Alon and Krivelevich <ref> [1] </ref> proved two point concentration for ff = 1=2 + ffi, for any ffi &gt; 0. In a recent paper [3] the second author proved a necessary and sufficient condition for a monotone graph property to have a sharp threshold (for a definition see section 2). <p> For a monotone graph property A we let (p) = (A; n; p) = Pr [G (n; p) has property A] : Note that (p) is a polynomial in p, monotone in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, such that (0) = 0 and (1) = 1.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we can assume that H itself is k-colorable. To see this, first note that by an application of the first moment method <ref> [2] </ref> it follows that G (n; d=n) is a.s. non-k-colorable for d &gt; 2k log k, and hence p fl = O (n 1 ). Moreover, observe that for k 3 any non-k-colorable graph R must contain a subgraph S of minimum degree at least k.

Reference-contexts: It is not difficult to see that the two point width of the concentration interval is best possible for general p. Finally, Alon and Krivelevich [1] proved two point concentration for ff = 1=2 + ffi, for any ffi &gt; 0. In a recent paper <ref> [3] </ref> the second author proved a necessary and sufficient condition for a monotone graph property to have a sharp threshold (for a definition see section 2). In this paper, we use this condition to prove that k-colorability has a sharp threshold, for every constant k 3. <p> If for some t &gt; 0, the ratio ffi (t )=p c is bounded away from 0 we will say that A has a coarse threshold. In <ref> [3] </ref> the second author gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a graph property to have a coarse threshold. Roughly speaking a graph property with a coarse threshold can be approximated by the property of having a subgraph isomorphic to a graph from a fixed list of graphs. <p> Also let jGj denote the number of edges in G. Recall that a balanced graph is one for which the average degree is no smaller than that of any of its subgraphs. 2 Theorem 2.1 <ref> [3] </ref> Let A be any monotone symmetric family of graphs on n vertices and p fl be such that p fl d dp j p=p fl C for some C &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: A further step in this direction was made by Luczak <ref> [4] </ref> who showed that if a &gt; 5=6, then (G (n; p)) is a.s. two point concentrated. It is not difficult to see that the two point width of the concentration interval is best possible for general p.

Reference-contexts: We will say that G (n; p) has a property A almost surely (a.s.) if the probability it satisfies A tends to 1 as n tends to infinity. Let (G) denote the chromatic number of a graph G. Shamir and Spencer <ref> [5] </ref> proved that for every constant ff &gt; 1=2, if p = O (n ff ) then the chromatic number of G (n; p) is almost surely concentrated in some fixed number of values.
