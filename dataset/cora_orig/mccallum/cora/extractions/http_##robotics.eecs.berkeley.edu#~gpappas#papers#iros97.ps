Abstract: We explore the use of distributed on-line motion planning algorithms for multiple mobile agents, in Air Traffic Management Systems (ATMS). The work is motivated by current trends in ATMS to move towards decentralized air traffic management, in which the aircraft operate in "free flight" mode instead of following prespecified "sky freeways". Conflict resolution strategies are an integral part of the free flight setting. In [TPS96], a set of predefined coordination maneuvers has been proposed. The purpose of this paper is to extend this set of maneuvers to cover all possible conflict scenarios involving multiple agents. A distributed motion planning algorithm based on potential and vortex fields is used. While the algorithm is not always guaranteed to generate flyable trajectories, the obtained trajectories can serve as qualitative prototypes for coordination maneuvers between multiple aircraft. The actual maneuvers are generated by approximating these prototypes with trajectories made up of straight lines and arcs of circles.

Reference-contexts: In path planning for more than two agents, prioritized schemes have been used to fix the order in which the conflicts are resolved. In <ref> [CI93] </ref> it was shown that for air traffic maneuvers which are constrained by the turning angle and the maximum deviation from the planned trajectory, certain priority orderings failed to resolve the conflict. Other work in air traffic conflict resolution has been done in [PE96].

Reference-contexts: The design of control laws is often based on potential and vortex field methods [RK93, MO91]. Complexity is proportional to the number of agents. An attempt to guarantee that the agents achieve their goals without colliding with each other has been proposed by Masoud <ref> [Mas96] </ref>. In spite of the fact that collision avoidance is an integral part of agents' navigation capabilities, the requirements for safety and optimality have not been addressed to any great extent. <p> These sets of maneuvers will then be proven to be safe using dynamic aircraft models. 4 The Algorithm We adopt the potential and vortex field approach for distributed motion planning proposed in <ref> [Mas96] </ref>. In air traffic control the absence of stationary obstacles and the approximation of individual agents by circles with a specified radius constitute reasonable assumptions prior to formulating the collision avoidance strategy 1 . We consider the planar collision avoidance problem with multiple moving agents.

Reference-contexts: The conflict resolution strategies are at the top of the agenda for making free flight a reality. We consider the conflict resolution problem as a part of the overall ATMS architecture. In Section 2 we overview the proposed architecture <ref> [SMT + 95] </ref> and describe the existing approach to conflict resolution. <p> In Section 3, we discuss the multiple robot motion planning problem, and in Section 4, we demonstrate a distributed algorithm for a more generalized set of collision avoidance maneuvers. 2 Air Traffic Management and Conflict Resolution In the proposed ATMS architecture of <ref> [SMT + 95] </ref>, each aircraft is equipped with a trajectory planning algorithm, and an algorithm to resolve potential collision conflicts with other aircraft. Each aircraft follows a nominal path from source airport to destination airport described by a sequence of waypoints, which are fixed points in the airspace.

Reference-contexts: In the proposed ATMS, the aircraft may plan its own deviation trajectories without consulting ATC. This semi-autonomy is enabled by on-board conflict resolution algorithms. Conflict resolution is addressed in the proposed ar 1 chitecture at two different levels <ref> [TPS96] </ref>. The first attempt to resolve the conflict is to perform noncooperative conflict resolution with no coordination between the agents. The agents are treated as players in an n-player, zero-sum noncooperative dynamic game. <p> The agents follow predefined maneuvers which are proven to be safe. The class of maneuvers constructed to resolve conflicts must be rich enough to cover most possible conflict scenarios. Several qualitatively different conflict scenarios have been distinguished in <ref> [TPS96] </ref> and provably correct collision avoidance strategies proposed. Examples of head-on and overtake maneuvers can be seen in Figure 1 and 2. <p> When multiple aircraft are involved in conflict the vector field based planner is very instructional: the direction of the vortex field contribution serves as a coordination element between the aircraft. Figure 9 depicts a symmetric roundabout maneuver similar to the one proposed in <ref> [TPS96] </ref>. <p> These resultant maneuvers may be time optimized according to the velocities of the two aircraft, as in <ref> [TPS96] </ref>, and may be verified to be safe for dynamic aircraft models. For more than two aircraft, we propose a maneuver called a roundabout, suggested in [TPS96] as a way to deal with multiple aircraft conflicts. <p> These resultant maneuvers may be time optimized according to the velocities of the two aircraft, as in <ref> [TPS96] </ref>, and may be verified to be safe for dynamic aircraft models. For more than two aircraft, we propose a maneuver called a roundabout, suggested in [TPS96] as a way to deal with multiple aircraft conflicts. For this maneuver, a circular path is defined around the conflict point, with the size of the circle again proportional to the influence zones of the aircrafts' repulsive and vortex fields.
