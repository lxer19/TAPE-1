Abstract: We initiate a probabilistic study of configuration functions of moving points. In our probabilistic model, a particle is given an initial position and a velocity drawn independently at random from the same distribution D. We show that if n particles are drawn independently at random from the uniform distribution on the square, their convex hull undergoes fi(log 2 n) combinatorial changes in expectation, their Voronoi diagram undergoes fi(n 3=2 ) combinatorial changes, and their closest pair undergoes fi(n) combinatorial changes. A probabilistic analysis of kinetic data structures is initiated.

Reference-contexts: This type of analysis, initiated by Renyi and Sulanke [RS63] is valuable because this expectation is in general much smaller than the worst case, and, more importantly, because it often allows one to design algorithms that have expected running times against which worst case aware algorithms cannot compete <ref> [BCL90, Dwy91b] </ref>.

More recently, Basch, Guibas, and Hershberger <ref> [BGH97] </ref> have designed data structures (called kinetic) to maintain these attributes in an online setting, measuring the quality of a kinetic data structure by the ratio of the worst case number of changes to the configuration of interest to the worst case number of changes to the data structure itself, for <p> We also analyze the expected running time of one of the algorithms proposed in <ref> [BGH97] </ref> for the maintenance of the convex hull.

Reference-contexts: This measure is not ideal and would gain to be replaced by one akin to the competitive ratio, but there is no result in this direction yet. In the meanwhile, an experimental study has been undertaken to assess the quality of these data structures in practice <ref> [BGSZ97] </ref>, showing that the worst case analysis can hide vastly different results in terms of expectation when the point positions and speeds are drawn at random from some distributions. It is this study, with its surprising experimental results, that motivated the present paper. <p> Using another appropriate space-time transformation, the reader will easily see that the expected number of events in this model is the same as in our model. In <ref> [BGSZ97] </ref>, a number of particles were independently drawn at random this way, and the number of events of several kinetic data structures, for several underlying distributions, were studied experimentally. <p> Another method was proposed in [BGH97] and modified in <ref> [BGSZ97] </ref>, whose average running time is experimentally also roughly fi .

Reference-contexts: It is then necessary to carefully bound the Jacobian to finish the computation. As we are going to use this a few times, let us recall the the change of variable formula. (See e.g. Billingsley <ref> [Bil86] </ref>, Theorem 17.2.): Theorem 5. Let : V 7! V be a one-to-one mapping of an open set V onto an open set V . Suppose that has continuous partial derivatives ij .

Reference-contexts: The Delaunay triangulation can be used to maintain the closest pair, and will do it in roughly n 3=2 time in our probabilistic model. How do other methods compare? One solution is to maintain the L 1 Delaunay triangulation <ref> [CD85] </ref>, as one of its edges is the closest pair, but our techniques can be used to show that it undergoes roughly the same number of changes as the L 2 Delaunay.

Reference-contexts: Although this is probably not a tight bound, it is to be compared with the best known worst case upper bound of O [KTI95]. The furthest pair, on the other hand, is always constituted of two points that are on the convex hull. From this and Devroye's moment inequalities <ref> [Dev83] </ref>, we deduce that the number of changes to the furthest pair is polylogarithmic in expectation, for the square distribution. 15 6 Conclusion In this paper we initiated the study of average case behavior of some combinatorial properties defined on points moving on random trajectories.
