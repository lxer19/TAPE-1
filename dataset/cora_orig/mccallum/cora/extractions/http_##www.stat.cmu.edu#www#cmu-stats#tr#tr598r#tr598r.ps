Reference-contexts: Since larger values of p H (x) make it harder to reject H, p H (x) has often been suggested as a measure of the support which the observed data X = x lends to H. <ref> (See, for example, Lehmann 1975, p. 11 and Berkson 1942.) </ref> This suggestion is always informal, and no theory is ever put forward for what properties a measure of support should have. The suggestion has been very successful in simple problems, perhaps due to several well-known facts.
