Reference-contexts: At the top level of this PSE, the user can specify the physical model along with parameters such as length of wall, width of footing, soil type, footing type, wall type, etc. We plan to feed these parameters into FEA simulation package called SSCOMPPC <ref> [1] </ref>. The output of the FEA simulation package is the stresses at different points. This data can be used for back calculation and regression analysis. We plan to use symbolic mathematical software package like Mathematica, Maple, etc. for back calculation and regression analysis.

Reference-contexts: Analytical models of interference between foundations and retaining structures have been carried out using the stochastic theory of stress diffusivity in particular media. An analytical model of this nature for surface applied loading using the above theory was developed <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Methodology Our problem comprises of the following important aspects: 1. Formulate analytical models for wall footing interference , based on the above theory. In here, the differential equation for stress will be derived with a variable coefficient of stress diffusivity (-). 2.
