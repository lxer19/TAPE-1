Reference-contexts: 2), recall, the defaults are effectively propositional. 7.1 Review of Previously Available Inferencing Algorithms There are several previously available query-answering in-ferencing algorithms for parallel defaults in circumscription that are sound and complete for queries over fairly general expressive classes of first-order-form beliefs: [ Przymusinski, 1989 ] [ Ginsberg, 1989 ] <ref> [ Baker and Ginsberg, 1989 ] </ref> [ Inoue and Helft, 1990 ] [ Helft et al., 1991 ] . Each of these covers (at least) ground queries. All of these essentially require ef fective propositionality. <p> This method is based on introducing abnormality predicates. It extends and refines the by-now well-known style of abnormality theories, so as to apply to the case of arbitrary prioritization partial orders. In addition, the algorithms of [ Ginsberg, 1989 ] and <ref> [ Baker and Ginsberg, 1989 ] </ref> are essentially developed, conceptually as well as mathematically, in terms of maximizing default pre-orders. Thus they are easily extended to handle correctly the default, not just the predicate, case. <p> The punchline is that previously available algorithms support rich query-answering for parallel defaults in circumscription, for the expressive class of domain closure plus uniqueness of names (which includes propositional). In addition, two of the previously available query-answering algorithms, <ref> [ Baker and Ginsberg, 1989 ] </ref> and [ Przy-musinski, 1989 ] (who does not give a proof), apply to the prioritized case, but require that the prioritization partial order be layered. (Both also require queries to be closed.) 7.2 New Inference Algorithms Our general-case transform enables the extension of any parallel-case <p> Another potential use of our transform approach is to partially eliminate the input's prioritization, so as to produce a simpler prioritization, e.g., layered, in the output that can be handled by another available algorithm, e.g., <ref> [ Baker and Ginsberg, 1989 ] </ref> 's. 8 Computational Practicality 8.1 Computational Complexity of Inferencing, Generally, including Without Priorities A major practical difficulty for default reasoning, even without priorities, is the worst-case computational complexity of inferencing.

Reference-contexts: Each default can be viewed as an uncertain belief. Prioritization in circumscription [ McCarthy, 1986 ] [ Lif-schitz, 1985 ] <ref> [ Grosof, 1991 ] </ref> is one of the first, and most expressively general, concepts of precedence in the default reasoning literature. <p> More generally, precedence appears to be an important expressive aspect of defaults needed or useful to represent many domains. Bases for precedence information include not only specificity dominance but also reliability and authority of sources [ Grosof, 1993 ] , decision-theoretic utility (e.g., rules about emergencies have higher precedence) <ref> [ Grosof, 1991 ] </ref> [ Poole, 1992 ] , and temporal directionality (e.g., freshness; or Shoham's [ 1988 ] chronological minimization). 1.2 Virtues of Circumscription as a Focus For malism Circumscription is a historically central and relatively well-studied non-monotonic formalism, with a number of attractive characteristics. <p> Previously, however, there have not been any query-answering inferencing algorithms for sufficiently general cases of prioritization: i.e., to handle prioritization partial orders that are not layered (a.k.a. stratified), in the sense discussed first in <ref> [ Grosof, 1991 ] </ref> and studied more in [ Grosof, 1992b ] . In particular, as discussed there, non-layered prioritization partial orders are required to adequately represent even very simple cases of specificity in default inheritance. <p> This expressive class suffices to include the combination and extension of large classes of logic programs and default inheritance. 2 Preliminary Definitions: Prioritized Defaults and Circumscription Below, and throughout the paper, we follow the definitions, notation, and terminology of <ref> [ Grosof, 1991 ] </ref> and of [ Grosof, 1992b ] . Refer to either the former (sections 3 and 4 there) or the latter (sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.7, 2.9 there) to find what is not elaborated below. <p> Thanks also to two anonymous reviewers for helpful suggestions, some of which are incorporated only in the longer version of this paper. 14 Appendix: Additional Preliminary Definitions and Notation, and Proof of Central Theorem 14.1 Preliminary Definitions and Notation [The next definitions are repeated, mainly verbatim, from <ref> [ Grosof, 1991 ] </ref> (section 4 there).] Definition 14 (Pre-Order) A binary relation H is a pre-order when it is reflexive and transitive.

Reference-contexts: Second, feasibility for small numbers of defaults can be sometimes be leveraged in order to implement larger prioritized default theories. There exist previous techniques for decomposing large prioritized default theories into a collection of local default theories, each with a small number of defaults [ Grosof, 1992b ] <ref> [ Grosof, 1992a ] </ref> . Third, complexity of the transform can be kept manageable by expressively limiting the top-heaviness (m i ) of the prioritization partial order. <p> Good algorithms for other kinds of reasoning besides query-answering are also needed: for updating and belief revision, and for other directions, e.g., forward, of inferencing. Approaches to these are discussed for prioritized default circumscription in [ Grosof, 1992b ] <ref> [ Grosof, 1992a ] </ref> .

In particular, as discussed there, non-layered prioritization partial orders are required to adequately represent even very simple cases of specificity in default inheritance. <p> This expressive class suffices to include the combination and extension of large classes of logic programs and default inheritance. 2 Preliminary Definitions: Prioritized Defaults and Circumscription Below, and throughout the paper, we follow the definitions, notation, and terminology of [ Grosof, 1991 ] and of <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> . Refer to either the former (sections 3 and 4 there) or the latter (sections 2.2, 2.3, 2.7, 2.9 there) to find what is not elaborated below. For the reader's convenience, we have provided an Appendix that reprints some of those background definitions etc.. <p> Higher specificity corresponds to higher prioritization. McCarthy's [ 1986 ] original example for prioritized circumscription is birds flying, for example. See <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> (especially, chapters 1, 2, 5, and 6) for discussion and many more examples. More generally, one might also have other bases for prioritization-type precedence information, besides specificity, among a set of defaults. <p> More precisely: in a PDC, when the base implies domain closure plus uniqueness of names, then this first PDC is equivalent to a second PDC defined by replacing every default in the first PDC by the collection of its instances. Proof : See <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> : Theorem 2.47. 2 Theorem 10 (Extension to DCA & UNA) Our results in Theorem 8 thus generalize straightforwardly to permit the default formulas to be open or closed, when the restriction in Observation 9 is met. <p> there are four defaults, with formulas: D0 animal (:f lies ^ :bird) D1 bird (f lies ^ :ostrich ^ :penguin) D2 ostrich :f lies D3 penguin :f lies Examples Proof Overview: Our proof technique for the above Examples, and for the special case transform more generally, relies on results in <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> . The special-case transform, e.g., in the examples above, has as output a subset of the defaults that result from the general-case transform. Defaults can be dropped (from the general-case's output) when they are redundant in the sense of [ Grosof, 1992b ] 's Definition 4.17 and <p> transform more generally, relies on results in <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> . The special-case transform, e.g., in the examples above, has as output a subset of the defaults that result from the general-case transform. Defaults can be dropped (from the general-case's output) when they are redundant in the sense of [ Grosof, 1992b ] 's Definition 4.17 and Theorem 6.29. <p> minimize all the abnormality predicates in parallel. (No other defaults are maximized.) Proof Overview for Equivalence of Examples to Abnormalities plus Cancellation: The equivalence of this representation, for the above examples, can be proven straightforwardly using the results on abnormality theories, and their equivalence relationship to maximizing default formulas, in <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> (section 3.2 there). 2 Thus abnormalities with explicit cancellation provides an alternative way to transform a prioritized default represen tation into a parallel one, for these examples. 7 Uses for Implementation The transforms, both general-case and special-case, are useful as a front-end to inferencing algorithms that handle <p> However, this restriction is inessential. Maximizing arbitrary default formulas can be reduced, in a simple fashion, to minimizing predicates. <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> (section 7.6 there) shows a general method, imposing only overhead time that is polynomial in the input representation, to convert inferencing with arbitrary default formulas (and fixtures) 6 to inferencing with default formulas that are restricted to be predicate minimizations (with all fixtures expressed as fixing of <p> Another is to restrict expressive classes to those with significantly better complexity, e.g., such that inferencing over a large theory can be decomposed into in-ferencing over several smaller or simpler theories. <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> explores both of these avenues, especially the latter. 8.2 Computational Practicality of Inferencing Implemented via our Method Our transform, as used in our inference algorithms for prioritized defaults, potentially compounds the computational complexity situation for parallel defaults with yet another source of worst-case exponential complexity: in time, <p> Second, feasibility for small numbers of defaults can be sometimes be leveraged in order to implement larger prioritized default theories. There exist previous techniques for decomposing large prioritized default theories into a collection of local default theories, each with a small number of defaults <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> [ Grosof, 1992a ] . Third, complexity of the transform can be kept manageable by expressively limiting the top-heaviness (m i ) of the prioritization partial order. <p> Again, there are two kind of situations. The first kind is general expressiveness but small numbers of defaults. The second kind is expressive special cases with larger numbers of defaults: e.g., Closed World Assumption, some kinds of logic programs and predicate completions, sympathetically solitary default theories <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> (section 6.5 there), and some other cases. Let us summarize the foregoing's implications for overall inferencing via our method, combining both the transform and the parallel reasoning. <p> It will be interesting to compare this to Brewka [ 1989a ] [ 1989b ] [ 1994 ] alternative approach in which he defines new extended, prioritized variants of Poole's Theorist formalism and of Default Logic. Brewka's approach does not, in general, have the same entailment be havior (see <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> section 8.8). 10 Contrast With Other Algorithms and Approaches Our transformational approach (for transforming prioritized into parallel) and algorithms (for inferencing with prioritization) is quite different from previous approaches and algorithms for circumscription. <p> The previous approach to transforming a prioritized set of defaults into a parallel set of defaults is based on what <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> calls decomposition. [ Lifschitz, 1985 ] has shown an equivalence theorem, for the case of layered prioritization and predicate minimization, between a prioritized circumscription and a conjunction of parallel circumscriptions, one per layer. [ Grosof, 1992b ] (chapters 5 and 7, especially) has extended this to the <p> set of defaults into a parallel set of defaults is based on what <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> calls decomposition. [ Lifschitz, 1985 ] has shown an equivalence theorem, for the case of layered prioritization and predicate minimization, between a prioritized circumscription and a conjunction of parallel circumscriptions, one per layer. [ Grosof, 1992b ] (chapters 5 and 7, especially) has extended this to the case of arbitrary non-layered prioritization and arbitrary default formulas, and has shown 8 a similar result giving equivalence to a series (cascade) of parallel circumscriptions (extending a previous unpublished result by Lifschitz for the layered predicate case). <p> Good algorithms for other kinds of reasoning besides query-answering are also needed: for updating and belief revision, and for other directions, e.g., forward, of inferencing.

For example, the <ref> [ Inoue and Helft, 1990 ] </ref> algorithm can thus be extended to cover the expressive case of: domain closure plus uniqueness of names, for arbitrary prioritization, universal default formulas, universal base, quantifier-free fixtures, and closed queries.

Second, circumscription captures a core notion of default shared by most formalisms, corresponding closely to that of Poole's Theorist formalism [ 1988 ] .

Reference-contexts: Several other non-monotonic formalisms share a somewhat similar concept of prioritization-type precedence / degrees of confidence (and a somewhat similar concept of a default) to that in circumscription, including: the specificity dominance principle employed in inheritance, e.g., cf.

Reference-contexts: be P 2 -complete, i.e., co-NP-harder than monotonic entailment, in the propositional case of several expressively rich non-monotonic logical formalisms, including: circumscription (even minimizing predicates without priorities), Default Logic (even the "normal" case), Autoepistemic Logic, and several additional non-monotonic modal logics and other formalisms [ Eiter and Gottlob, 1993 ] <ref> [ Stillman, 1992 ] </ref> [ Gottlob, 1992 ] . There are several avenues to avoiding worst-case complexity of default reasoning, generally. One is to employ approximations, perhaps sound but incomplete, e.g., as in [ Cadoli and Schaerf, 1992 ] .

Being able to represent such is an expressive advantage of prioritized circumscription over default inheritance formalisms. Prioritized default circumscription enables the expressive extension of default inheritance (cf. <ref> [ Touretzky, 1986 ] </ref> ) in several directions. One direction is to represent prioritization information based other than on specificity. <p> Early work by Etherington & Reiter [ 1983 ] showed how to encode specificity in inheritance into Default Logic, starting from a path-based representation cf. <ref> [ Touretzky, 1986 ] </ref> . Delgrande & Schaub [ 1994 ] propose a general approach, applicable to many default formalisms: "to use the techniques of a weak system, as exemplified by System Z [ [ Pearl, 1990 ] ], to isolate minimal sets of conflicting defaults.
