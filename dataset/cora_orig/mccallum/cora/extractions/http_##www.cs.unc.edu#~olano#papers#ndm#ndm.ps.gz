Abstract: Normal Distribution Mapping 1 Abstract: Normal distribution mapping is an extension of traditional texture mapping methods to normal and shading information. The surface normal direction and shading for a patch of surface are represented by a statistical distribution of normal directions. The normal distribution map is a map of these distributions as they vary over the surface. Normal distribution mapping admits considerable freedom in the choice of probability density function. We propose using a distribution based on a 3D Gaussian for this purpose. This distribution can be easily filtered for map antialiasing and cheaply evaluated for surface shading. One way to think about polygonal representations of smooth surfaces is in terms of sampling and reconstruction. Each vertex is a sample of the smooth surface. We reconstruct an approximation to that surface from the vertex sample locations. The quality of the polygonal approximation depends on the sampling rate and distribution how many vertices were used and where they were placed. Sometimes we will also use a color and normal at each vertex to reconstruct the color and shading of the smooth surface. However, the sampling that is most appropriate for the surface geometry is not necessarily the best choice for reconstructing the surface color, and the best rate for the color is not best for the geometry. Texture mapping addresses this problem by divorcing the sampling of the color from the sampling of the geometry. While texturing solves the problems of color sampling, we still sample surface normals at the vertices (see Figure 1). Gouraud shading and Phong shading provide different schemes for reconstructing the smooth surface shading from the sampled normals. We have observed in recent work in level of detail and multiresolution surface approximation, that appropriate sampling for the surface geometry does not necessarily provide appropriate sampling for the normals either. For example, simplification envelopes [Cohen96] can guarantee that the polygonal approximation to a surface is correct to within one pixel. Yet the surface highlights may change drastically between one level of detail and the next (see Figure 2). We are aware of work in progress to incorporate surface normal and curvature information in the simplification process, but this will result in excess polygons, not necessary to represent the geometry faithfully. If we can separate the normal sampling from the geometry sampling, it will be Normal Distribution Mapping
