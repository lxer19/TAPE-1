Reference-contexts: Sugiura's work [7] and Lawrence-Fowler's work [3] concentrate on the issue of personalizing the Web page from client point of view. They both create annotated Web pages to help users index and navigate Web using personalized information. Frelechoux and Kamba <ref> [1] </ref> proposed a user profile manager in between the server and the client: a proxy server that relives the personalized servers from the tasks of user profile management and provides support for advanced personalization techniques such as collaborative filtering.

Reference-contexts: It can be considered as part of a Web server's functionality; it can be considered as part of a Web client's functionality; or it can be the work of a proxy server. Many research projects have tackled the issue from different perspectives. Gabber et.al. <ref> [2] </ref> described a structure (the Janus Personalized Web Anonymizer) that makes the personalized Web browsing feasible. Janus automatically generates an alias for each user that can be used to establish an anonymous account at the Web site.

Reference-contexts: It frees the user from the burden of inventing and memorizing distinct usernames and secure passwords for each Web site and guarantees that an alias does not reveal the true identity of the user. Sugiura's work [7] and Lawrence-Fowler's work <ref> [3] </ref> concentrate on the issue of personalizing the Web page from client point of view. They both create annotated Web pages to help users index and navigate Web using personalized information.

Reference-contexts: It is a time-consuming process. In order to alleviate this situation, we are developing parallel programming environment that can speed up the process. See <ref> [4] </ref> for reference. For a single processing environment, what we did was to process the first a few URLs (e.g. 10) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the filtering process. The more sites are contacted, the more accurate the results would be.

Reference-contexts: We review some related works in Section 4, followed by some of our thoughts and future work in Section 5. 2 Personalized Profile Helps Search Personalized profile helps accurate information retrieval. Such ideas have been used in many applications, for example, PointCast <ref> [5] </ref> uses a personalized profile to selectively point cast information to individual computers. Other times a search engine may ask the user to establish an account on the server side where some personal preferences can be stored to help future search.

Reference-contexts: One common difficulty we face is how to find useful, relevant information among the hundreds and thousands of URLs. Search engines such as AltaVista (&lt;www.altavista.digital.com&gt;), Yahoo (&lt;www.yahoo.com&gt;) and many others (for a list of major search engines, visit &lt;www.searchenginewatch.com/facts/major.html&gt; and <ref> [6] </ref>) have been helping people find the information they want effectively and quickly. However, even with advanced search techniques, no search engine can provide the users with very accurate information within a relatively short list. The reasons behind this phenomenon are multi-fold. <p> There are different mechanisms to building user profiles. Some provide personalized account on the server side; others build profiles about particular users; yet others use "cookies" 1 <ref> [6] </ref> to collect information about users. All these strategies work to certain extent as far as the accuracy of search results is concerned. However users are reluctant to allow search engines to collect and keep their profiles on the server site because of the concern of privacy.
