Reference-contexts: CIRCA also incorporates some of the fairly recent advances in planning and execution techniques (e.g., indexical-functional variables <ref> (Agre & Chapman 1987) </ref>, reactive execution). The following sections provide more detail on how CIRCA's plan execution component uses these techniques while also providing a strictly predictable execution behavior that CIRCA relies on to enforce guaranteed plans for mission-critical domains.

Reference-contexts: With a more rigorous understanding of the performance features of complex plan execution systems like RAPs <ref> (Firby 1987) </ref>, their powerful flexibility can be used in the context of verified systems for mission critical domains. It is important to note that the drive for a more predictable system does not necessarily require us to abandon the recognized advantages of new methods like reactive execution. <p> CIRCA's Predictable Executive Building this type of predictable executive for the CIRCA system required several essential design elements. Reviewing these design decisions is made particularly interesting by keeping in mind the features of the more common executives such as RAPs <ref> (Firby 1987) </ref> and PRS (Georgeff & Ingrand 1989; Ingrand, Georgeff, & Rao 1992). In CIRCA, the Real-Time Subsystem (RTS) fulfills the role of plan executor, taking in cyclic loops of Test Action Pairs (TAPs) from the parallel planning system.

Reference-contexts: In the current implementation, dynamic memory allocation is used during downloading of a new TAP schedule (plan), but nowhere else; appropriate use of indexical-functional variables avoids the need to "gensym" new names for the changing objects in the world. 1 Complete details on this design are available in <ref> (Musliner 1993) </ref>. No Interrupts | Unlike many systems which at-tempt to ensure real-time performance through rapid response to interrupts, the RTS does not accept any interrupts.

Reference-contexts: The planner's world model incorporates indexical-functional state features explicitly, thus realizing both their advantages for efficient planning <ref> (Musliner 1994) </ref> and reactive execution.

Reference-contexts: The CIRCA Approach In the CIRCA approach to automated control for mission-critical domains, the planner reasons about a fairly complex model of world dynamics and primitive control behaviors <ref> (Musliner, Durfee, & Shin 1995) </ref>. Projecting the world dynamics forward, the planner synthesizes plans in a quite simple form called a Test-Action Pair (TAP) schedule, which is essentially a loop of if-then rules that are sequentially tested and executed.
