Abstract: Two-dimensional arrays are suitable for VLSI implementation because of their regular structure and relative ease of test. We provide test sets proportional to the sum of the two dimensions of the array for a large class of cells, which allow us to test rows (or columns) of cells of the array independently. Previous research has found constant length test sets for array multipliers under the single faulty cell model if the array is modified and otherwise test sets are proportional to the number of cells. We can verify the full adder array of a combinational n fi m multiplier in O(n + m) tests under the Multiple Faulty Cell (MFC) model. We show that no constant length test set exists for this array under the MFC model. The entire multiplier, including the AND gates which generate the summands, can be verified after applying the same modifications which make the multiplier C-testable under the single faulty cell model. Finally we show an error in the proof of a commonly accepted theorem involving testing two-dimensional arrays for multiple faults.

The change in the carry truth table is shown in Table 2.3. 22 2. <p> These inputs may have non-0 values only during testing. When all the X and Y primary inputs to the multiplier are assigned 0, the cell inputs hy; a; b; xi equal to 0001 or 0101 never occur in the correctly functioning multiplier <ref> [9] </ref>. Hence the MCS multiplier functions exactly the same as the carry save multiplier in normal operation and does not affect the multiplication function of the array.

Whenever possible we use the notation and definitions in [12]. directly controllable, and the outputs z 1 ; : : : ; z n and x n+1 are directly observable. Each cell in an ILA can be viewed as a sequential circuit in which the x is the state, y the input, and z the output. <p> This ensures that its flow table is strongly connected. If the flow table is subsequently reduced, then the resulting cell will still be column-separable and satisfy Dias' requirements. We now restate Procedure 1 from Dias <ref> [12] </ref>. 1.1. Testing 2-D ILAs with tests sets proportional to the sum of the dimensions 11 Procedure 1: Consider an ILA whose basic cell has M states and N possible input vectors and is Dias-testable. <p> However, choosing y = 01 (or 10) provides a next state equal to s i , which makes the Z 1 sequence unnecessary if the transition is to the same state. Dias makes this observation in <ref> [12] </ref>, and produces a sequence of length 8 which exercises all 8 transitions. He claims that this test and its 7 shifts are sufficient.

Reference-contexts: Prasad and Gray provided test sets of length proportional to the number of cells (O (nm) tests for an n fi m array) for a class of two-dimensional arrays under the MFC model <ref> [14] </ref>. We provide test sets of length proportional to the sum of the dimensions of the array (m + n for an n fi m array) which apply to cells meeting Dias' requirements and a weaker version of Prasad and Gray's requirements. <p> The conditions imposed on cells by Prasad and Gray for their O (mn) test set are equivalent to a cell being both column-separable and row-separable <ref> [14] </ref>. Example: Buffer Array We consider the problem of testing a two-dimensional array of buffer cells. The behavior of a buffer cell is given by h (x; y) = x and v (x; y) = y. This cell is both column-separable and row-separable.

Reference-contexts: Cheng and Patel obtain a minimum test set under the MFC model for the ripple-carry adder with only 11 tests <ref> [15] </ref>. Applying the Cheng and Patel tests to each row requires only 8n + 3 tests since three of the tests are the same for all rows. The total number of tests is m + n + 1 + 8n + 3 = 9n + m + 4. <p> Cheng and Patel <ref> [15] </ref> obtain a smaller test set of 11 patterns by using different IS's in the looptests but with tests which verify that different IS's applied to a cell are operating with the same encoding convention. <p> Cheng and Patel presented a minimum row test for the RCA using the MFC fault model <ref> [15] </ref>. If this row test is used instead of the one presented, there are 11n T k tests of which all but 8n + 2 are shared with other tests.
