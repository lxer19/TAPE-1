Title: The River Beyond the Rapids: Responsive Services for Responsible Users  
Author: Ben Shneiderman 
Affiliation: University of Maryland  
Abstract: Providing responsive services to all members of our society will require new corporate alliances that put the users and their needs ahead of the pursuit of new technology. Responsive systems are the boats on which responsible users will travel to their work, social communities, and entertainment. With responsive systems users can take responsibility for what they promise to do and derive satisfaction from accomplishing their tasks. The keys to user responsibility are comprehensible, predictable, and controllable interfaces.
