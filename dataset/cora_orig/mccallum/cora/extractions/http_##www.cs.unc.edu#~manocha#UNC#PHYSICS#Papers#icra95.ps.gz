Abstract: Maintainability is an important issue in design where the accessibility of certain parts is determined for routine maintenance. In the past its study has been largely manual and labor intensive. Either by using physical mockup or computer animation with CAD models of a design, the task relies on human to provide an access path for the part. In this paper, we present an automated approach to replace this manual process. By applying results from and developing extensions to research in motion planning and other fields, we demonstrate that an automated maintainability study system is feasible. We describe general extensions needed to adapt robotic motion planning techniques in maintainability studies. We show results from applying such a system to two classes of industrial application problems.

Reference-contexts: Other compromises include on-demand computation of C-space (e.g., [Lozano91]). There are many other heuristic approaches proposed in the literature (see [Hwang92] for a detailed survey). One notable technique has been demonstrated in the so-called Randomized Path Planner (RPP) <ref> [Barraquand90] </ref>. It takes a probabilistic approach to take advantage of available redundant degrees of freedom that may result in more available ``paths and the fact that the environment may not be as cluttered to allow only a smaller number of paths to exist. <p> Its planner is based on the RPP. For collision detection, we implemented the algorithm reported in [Quinlan94] to reduce the number of calls to an exact collision checking routine that models after [Gilbert85]. We review relevant details of the RPP first (Details can be found in <ref> [Barraquand90] </ref>). Then, we elaborate on our extension to the planner to handle some of the requirements described in the previous section. The RPP uses heuristic potential fields as a guide to search for a path and uses Brownian motions (random walks) to escape local minima of the potential fields.

Reference-contexts: In that context, a path found for a robot in an environment is a sequence of configurations of the robot linking its initial configuration with a designated final configuration. There are many literature surveys on general motion planning (e.g., [Latombe91] and <ref> [Hwang92] </ref>). What we are interested in maintainability study maps in to what is called the ``Piano Mover Problem. This problem can be simply described as moving a solid in In Proceedings of 1995 IEEE Int'l Conf. on Robotics and Automation 3-space with 6 degrees of freedom (dof) amongst stationary obstacles. <p> Resolution dependent solutions try to sample at a discrete resolution the C-space when n is large (see [Don-ald87]). Other compromises include on-demand computation of C-space (e.g., [Lozano91]). There are many other heuristic approaches proposed in the literature (see <ref> [Hwang92] </ref> for a detailed survey).

Reference-contexts: Some of our studies are non-conclusive after several days (one particular assembly took more than a week (on the SGI workstation mentioned above) and was eventually terminated manually). To address this problem, we are planning on exploring other techniques such as the randomized roadmap algorithm in <ref> [Kavraki94] </ref>. In that direction, we will try to emphasize the deterministic behavior of a planner. 5 Conclusions We developed a first-known practical automated assembly maintainability study system by incorporating results from research in robotics motion planning. In this paper, we present a dynamic, adaptive multi-resolution model in the system.

Reference-contexts: For lower dof cases such as an object moving in 2-space, its C-space can be efficiently computed to provide for a complete search for a feasible path (an example of such solution is seen in [Loza-no79] and <ref> [Lozano83] </ref>). For higher dof cases, it is much more difficult to solve the problem this way simply due to the limitations with current computer technology in available memory and processing speed. For all practical purposes, explicit computation of C-space when the dof is greater than 4 is impractical.

Reference-contexts: This type of techniques is typically costly to apply to real world problems because of the vast search space it has to cover before making a conclusion. An example of this type of algorithm is that of Schwartz and Sharir <ref> [Schwartz83b] </ref>. Their complete polynomial algorithm takes, unfortunately, O (n^(2 d+6 )) time, where n is the complexity of the obstacles (i.e., the number of edges) and d is the number of degrees of freedom.
