Reference-contexts: However, it also leads to smoothing across edges. Several nonlinear diffusion schemes have therefore been developed in literature (table 1.2). It is worth mentioning that the edge-affected diffusion <ref> [ 9 ] </ref> actually prevents blurring edges by allowing a conductance parameter to vary over space, and making the conductance dependent on the image gradient: @L = r g (jrLj)rL (3) The conductance g is here a bounded, positive, decreasing, nonlinear function which affects equation (1) in limiting blurring near edges <p> For very large k, both versions of equation (4) give a limiting value of g = 1, resulting in linear diffusion.
