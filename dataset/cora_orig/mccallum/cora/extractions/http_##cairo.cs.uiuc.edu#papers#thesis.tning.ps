The architecture of current WWW is extended to encompass the dynamic, real-time information space of video and audio. <p> VDP also incorporates an adaptation algorithm to find the optimal transmission bandwidth, and it demands resending algorithm to handle loss of frame packets <ref> [3] </ref>. Unlike other network protocols, the VDP is an asymmetric protocol. A VDP connection consists of two distinguished endpoints which belong to the client side and video server. There are two communication channels associated with each VDP connection.

Reference-contexts: in multimedia computing. 20 3 System Design 3.1 Overview Due to the fact that speed of standard computer processor continues to increase, prices continue to drop, and multi-processor architectures are becoming more widely available and accessible, some interesting problems such as visual tracking can be carried out on standard workstations <ref> [5] </ref>. The Visual Tracking System used by this thesis work as an application program is a vivid example in multimedia computing which needs to interact with end user dynamically. <p> The model of computation is one of independent tracking agents that communicate information to one another in a hierarchical network. The system is object-oriented. As a preview of the system structure, the figure 4.1 shows the current set of classes defined in system <ref> [5] </ref>. There are two essential ideas for the design of Visual Tracking System. They are window-based image processing and state-based programming of hierarchy networks of objects being tracked [5]. <p> As a preview of the system structure, the figure 4.1 shows the current set of classes defined in system <ref> [5] </ref>. There are two essential ideas for the design of Visual Tracking System. They are window-based image processing and state-based programming of hierarchy networks of objects being tracked [5]. A brief summary of these classes is given below. 31 32 4.2.1 Kernel Class The kernel class of Visual Tracking System provides the functionality of creating and managing hierarchy feature network for objects being tracked. <p> It is also responsible for the system's initialization. The kernel class can be divided into three categories according to their functionality: feature definition classes, interface classes, and utility classes <ref> [5] </ref>. Feature Definition Classes Feature trackers can be defined by using one of the following three classes [5]: * BasicFeature Class The BasicFeature class is a pure virtual class which defines the interface for a generic object being tracked and provides necessary system routines for accessing and modifying its state. <p> It is also responsible for the system's initialization. The kernel class can be divided into three categories according to their functionality: feature definition classes, interface classes, and utility classes <ref> [5] </ref>. Feature Definition Classes Feature trackers can be defined by using one of the following three classes [5]: * BasicFeature Class The BasicFeature class is a pure virtual class which defines the interface for a generic object being tracked and provides necessary system routines for accessing and modifying its state. This class should at least include following functions: Initialization, Updating and Display. <p> It is different from the CompFeature because it is not allowed to modify the state of the subsidiary features of the class instance. Interface Classes There are two interface classes defined in the system <ref> [5] </ref>: * Video The Video is a virtual class which defines the interface to a digitizer, and it provides the operations for basic image acquisition and display. <p> It requires that any interactive initial ization device be able to position and orient a tracking window. Utility Classes There are two utility classes in the system as convenient tools for inventing new track ers <ref> [5] </ref>: * Image The Image is a base class which provides a rudimentary level of image storage, manipulation and a few other simple functions. * BaseType 34 The BaseType is a virtual class which its child classes provide a primitive static and dynamic typing scheme. <p> This will be very efficient as long as the detection or matching routines provide enough information to maintain the position and orientation of the window relative to the features in the image <ref> [5] </ref>. 4.2.3 A Concrete Example In order to illustrate mechanism embedded in tracking system, a concrete example of defining intersecting lines with CompFeature is given in this chapter. <p> Any operation simply executes the routines for each of its children. The update cycle can be customized by allocating a local state vector and defining two functions, compute state and constraint. These functions calculate the CompFeature's state from its children, and then propagate state back to its children <ref> [5] </ref>. 35 The function propagate is defined below: virtual int propagate () - int res = constraints (); foreach child do res |= child.propagate (); return res; - The update functions can be defined by using propagate as: virtual int update () - foreach child do res |= child.update (); compute_state

Reference-contexts: Hager at Yale University. The first version of this framework originated in summer of 1993 and the first edge tracker was 4 based on Greg Hager's dissertation work. The potential applications of this technology include surveillance, video conferencing, interactive video games, interactive animation, and vision-based user interfaces <ref> [6] </ref>. The original Visual Tracking System provides an application independent set of tools for visual feature tracking optimized to be simple to configure at the user level, yet extremely fast to execute. <p> Hence, as opposed to most multimedia applications where the visual signal is passively transmitted. By using the Visual Tracking System, it is possible to program interactive, feedback-based applications with passive sensing <ref> [6] </ref>. Since the Visual Tracking System is an ideal choice of prototype for video conferencing, remote surveillance, it is not surprised that it is ported in this thesis work functioning as the multimedia application layer. <p> Subsequent processing of the warped window can then be simplified by assuming the feature is in or near this canonical configuration. As a result, the image processing algorithms used in feature-tracking can focus on the problem of accurate configuration adjustment rather than general-purpose feature detection <ref> [6] </ref>. The motion vector is computed using SSD differences between the original region of interests and the new region of interests. Once the motion vector is known, an estimated position of the moved object can be determined. See figure 1.5. <p> From this point of view, the systems based on the latter strategy is efficient and cost effective. They are also quite flexible and portable since all the system is based on the software level <ref> [6] </ref>. Visual Tracking System using localized object feature recognition has been widely used in various categories. The first category determines structure from the object motion. Structure from motion algorithms attempt to recover the three-dimensional structure of object by observing object's movement in multiple camera image frames. <p> The key point for the applications in this category is to inte 22 grate simple features into a consistent whole feature, both to predict the configurations of features in the future and to evaluate the accuracy of any single feature <ref> [6] </ref>. Although there are a lot of tracking applications at current time, the basic features used by them are still very simple, such as line segments, corners based on line segments, small patches of texture, and easily detectable highlights. Most important, existing tracking methodologies lack modularity and portability. <p> For example, a polygon can be decomposed into polyhedral faces and these polyhedral faces can be further decomposed into lines. By giving such relationship, these lines can finally be projected into predefined screen coordinate and displayed <ref> [6] </ref>. Visual Tracking System also describes how the pose or attitude is computed by giving the locations of those graphical primitives. <p> Tracking a feature means that the region of interest retains a relatively fixed, pre-defined relationship to the feature. Fundamentally, the goal of the low-level processing is to process the pixels within 23 a window using a minimal number of addressing operations, data bus transfer cycles and arithmetic calculation <ref> [6] </ref>. 3.2.2 Image Warping In addition to the Feature Tracking at Image-Level, another mechanism which is called Image Warping [6] is deployed to geometrically transform windows so that image features appear in a canonical configuration. <p> Fundamentally, the goal of the low-level processing is to process the pixels within 23 a window using a minimal number of addressing operations, data bus transfer cycles and arithmetic calculation <ref> [6] </ref>. 3.2.2 Image Warping In addition to the Feature Tracking at Image-Level, another mechanism which is called Image Warping [6] is deployed to geometrically transform windows so that image features appear in a canonical configuration.

It is designed to provide bulk distribution of files and is interesting in its use of a hierarchical tree to ensure scalability. RMTP has been implemented on the MBONE and a version of RMTP/UDP/IP is currently deployed in AT&T's switched network, which uses only IP-Multicast routers.

Reference-contexts: The Designated Receiver can thus keep track of the members of its local region group <ref> [9] </ref>. The Designated Receiver is actually a special client host with dual functionalities. It receives frame packets from the Visual Tracking Server via unicast, and retrans-mits to the client hosts in its local group via multicast.

In this thesis, we only discuss the research and implementation of the network transmission layer. 2.2 MBONE Virtual Network The MBONE (Multicasting Backbone) <ref> [11] </ref> network originated from an effort to mul-ticast real-time audio and video by the IETF in 1992, and it is a virtual network. It is based around the use of IP multicast protocol and the use of tunnels.

Reference-contexts: being done on moving multicast support into IPng, though, it seems reasonable to expect that the size of the multicast user community relative to the size of the Internet as a whole will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. 14 2.3 Real-Time Transport Protocol The RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) <ref> [12] </ref> is a new network protocol which provides end-to-end delivery services for data with real-time characteristics, such as interactive video conferencing and audio net-meeting. Those services include type identification, sequence numbering, time stamping and delivery monitoring.

Reference-contexts: In this phase, Performance Profiler on the Designated Receiver will closely 28 monitor the performance of localhost and client hosts in its multicast group. If the detected errors exceed a threshold, it will use IPC (Interprocess Communication) <ref> [13] </ref> to inform the Multicasting Service and the Group Member Management modules that actions should be taken by system according to the spec ification of our proposed protocol. * Phase IV: Disconnection In order to perform a graceful shutdown, system must pass through the Disconnection phase.

Reference-contexts: Those services include type identification, sequence numbering, time stamping and delivery monitoring. Applications typically run RTP on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol) <ref> [14] </ref> to make use of its multiplexing and checksum services, and both protocols contribute parts of the transport protocol functionality. RTP also supports data transfer to multiple destinations using multicast distribution if provided by the underlying network. Actually, it is primarily designed to satisfy the needs of multi-participant multimedia conferences. <p> The Group Member Management module is closely associated with the Multicasting Service. It is functioning on both of the Visual Tracking Server and the Designated Receiver using IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) <ref> [14] </ref>. In order to better understand the design issues of our proposed MWL, a typical visual tracking session is shown in figure 3.1. <p> Otherwise, both sides will time out and start over from the beginning. This is a traditional TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) Three-way Handshake <ref> [14] </ref> connection session. One thing needs to be mentioned is that we used ATM network in this thesis work, and the transmission media is optical fiber, so the transmission error rate is very low (10 7 ). <p> The services provided by ATM network card can be accessed by building our system on top of TCP or UDP (User Datagram Protocol) <ref> [14] </ref>. We choose the UDP due to the reliability of ATM network. If Ethernet is deployed in this scenario, it is advised to use TCP to guarantee the reliability. <p> The processor load on each host, especially on the Designated Receiver fluctuates significantly. In the worst case, the Designated Receiver could crash due to unpredictable fatal errors. To circumvent these problems, the Performance Profiler is built up on top of the SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) <ref> [14] </ref> to monitor a set of parameters which are related to the system performance. The parameters monitored by the Performance Profiler are: * tcpInSegs The tcpInSegs is a variable defined in the RFC1213-MIB, and its identifier is 1.3.6.1.2.1.6.10.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of mul-ticasting over unicasting can be obviously seen from comparison between figure 1.1 and 1.2. Multimedia applications with characteristic of transmitting in one-to-n scenario over the current network backbone will benefit from this technology advancement. Recent studies <ref> [15] </ref> also show that as a result of bottleneck, more and more people are willing to download audio and animation from the Web site, and a much faster connection to send and receive the huge audio and video files is needed to enable the end user to take full advantage of
