Title: Digital Cash Payment Systems  
Author: Leah Fera Mike Hu Gene Cheung Mark Soper 
Date: December 6, 1996  
Abstract: The recent explosion in the popularity of the Internet has been accompanied by considerable interest in using this worldwide collection of interconnected computers as a medium for commerce. While electronic commerce in general is not itself a novel concept, the dizzying pace of change in the computer networking landscape of late promises to bring with it exciting new ways for individuals and companies to conduct business. In this paper, we begin by presenting a broad overview of current electronic commerce technologies. We then focus on one particularly interesting form of electronic payment: digital cash. We define specifically what is meant by digital cash, what a digital cash system entails, how such a payment system compares to other existing and proposed payment systems, and discuss the challenges that must be addressed in implementing digital currency on a wide scale. We provide a detailed description of several emerging digital cash systems, and address the advantages and disadvantages that the proliferation of a such a system might entail.

Such on-line marketplaces have emerged on the World Wide Web, and one might also include cable television shopping networks in this class.

Reference-contexts: Cryptography is the key to maintaining these secure transmissions. In 1976, mathematicians Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman developed the idea of Public Key Cryptography which is used to secure the transmission of important data <ref> [6] </ref>. This technique is now being implemented by several Digital Cash Systems including ecash. In previous encryption systems, one party used a secret code to encrypt a message, and the other party had an inverse code to decode the message.

Reference-contexts: Their system provides the means for security using public key cryptography and anonymity using a patented technique called blind signatures. The founder of Digicash, David Chaum, claims that their system is mutually advantageous to organizations who desire increased accountability and to individuals who desire privacy in their transactions <ref> [7] </ref>. Other problems encountered with digital cash such as double spending and forgery are also addressed. 10 5.1.1 Ecash Fundamentals Ecash is unique due to the design and implementation of a specific protocol used when making monetary transactions. <p> The bank maintains a database of note numbers that have already been spent to eliminate the chance of double spending or spending stolen notes. Old note numbers are removed from the database to prevent it from growing too large since each note number has a built in expiration date <ref> [7] </ref>. 5.1.2 Public Key Cryptography Most Digital cash payment systems use encryption techniques to secure electronic transmissions of electronic cash and other important data. Cryptography is the key to maintaining these secure transmissions. <p> The keys are so difficult to forge that it would require the fastest machines millions of years to do so. The odds of guessing a valid encrypted message are less than 1 in 10 75 . <ref> [7] </ref> Digicash currently uses a key that is 768 bits long, but in the future, the ecash banks will decide on key formats and lengths for use with their customers [11]. 5.1.3 Pseudonyms and Digital Signatures In the ecash system, rather than using personal information to identify a consumer's account, an <p> The cost of checking each transaction is actually less than for current payment systems <ref> [7] </ref>. However, checking a database will only detect the fraud after the fact since the transaction between the consumer and the shop has already been initiated.

Reference-contexts: However, ensuring that each currency certificate is not spent more than once may involve enormous database and record-keeping requirements. Nascent digital currency systems are beginning to gain popularity on the Internet today. The remainder of the paper discusses examples of these systems, including DigiCash [?] and CyberCash <ref> [8] </ref>, and addresses in more detail the issues surrounding digital currency in general. 3 Requirements of a Digital Cash System The digital cash industry is in its infancy. In order for digital cash systems to become useful to Internet community, they must meet various requirements.

Reference-contexts: In addition, ecash can be transferred to cards that can be filled with ecash using an 'ATM' for ecash and spent at stores using special card readers <ref> [9] </ref>. Only a few banks, such as the Mark Twain Bank of Missouri, support special ecash "accounts", but if the ecash system becomes widely used, more will be established [11]. Both buyers and sellers must have a specific type of account at the bank.

Reference-contexts: Digital credit/debit may hold several advantages over existing credit/debit and checking systems, including the reduction of paperwork costs, increased transaction clearing time, the elimination of bounced checks, and greater flexibility. [11] Although such systems have been deployed on the Internet, including USC-ISI's Net-Cheque <ref> [10] </ref>, CMU's NetBill [12], and First Virtual's Infocommerce [5], they have yet to gain popularity. <p> Neuman and Medvinsky offer the following insight: For credit-debit or electronic currency systems to move beyond trials with play money, a separate tie to the existing banking system is needed to convert account balances and electronic currency to and from real money in a customer or merchant's bank account. <ref> [10] </ref> The primary differentiating factor for providers of this service will likely lie in the details of the cost and convenience of this reconciliation between on-line and real accounts. The third way in which payment could be made over the Internet is via a digital currency system.

This identifier, or "digital pseudonym", is a public key that is known to the organization.
