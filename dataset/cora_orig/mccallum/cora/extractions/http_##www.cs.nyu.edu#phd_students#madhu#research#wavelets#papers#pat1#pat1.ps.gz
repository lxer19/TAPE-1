Reference-contexts: In fact, we can find two entirely different functions which on convolution with the same Gaussian, can result in functions whose norms can be made arbitrarily close, for any choice of the norm <ref> [1] </ref>. 1.1 Relevant Results of the Literature In the literature, one finds that inverting (or deblurring) the Gaussian blur is modelled as a diffusion process running backwards in time, the variance parameter of the Gaussian being treated as proportional to the time elapsed.

Reference-contexts: However, note that this observation does in no way help to solve the inverse problem of deblurring Gaussian blur. 1 John <ref> [2] </ref> invokes a slightly less stringent stability concept, called polynomial stability, whereby the norm of the error f in the solution is bounded by some power of the norm of the error h in h : jj f jj &lt; C jj h jj 1=k ; k finite (2) 4 One

Reference-contexts: If the original function (f ) is not band-limited, the inversion is extremely sensitive to noise in the blurred signal, and it is not possible to establish the stability of the inversion. In this sense, techniques based on Fourier inversion are grossly inadequate. Hummel, Kimia and Zucker <ref> [3] </ref> pose the deblurring problem in a variational framework, and constrain the spaces of the original and the blurred signals, in an attempt to convert it to a well-conditioned problem. <p> The method decomposes the functions f and h into their respective multiscale approximations, and then effects the deconvolution in the frequency domain. Literature contains, what one may call, `single-step' deconvolution techniques, as in Hummel et al <ref> [3] </ref>, where it is a convolution operation with the deblur kernel D N , or as in Zucker and Kimia [4] where it amounts to an inversion of the Toeplitz blur matrix B. As a consequence, stability in [3] has been established for a restricted class of functions (polynomials of a <p> what one may call, `single-step' deconvolution techniques, as in Hummel et al <ref> [3] </ref>, where it is a convolution operation with the deblur kernel D N , or as in Zucker and Kimia [4] where it amounts to an inversion of the Toeplitz blur matrix B. As a consequence, stability in [3] has been established for a restricted class of functions (polynomials of a finite, fixed degree) while in [4] the method is not stable at all. <p> On the contrary, we arrive at a multiscale expansion of f and g, and then achieve deconvolution at each scale stage by stage. The advantage is that we establish a stability result of the type found in Hummel et al <ref> [3] </ref> at each scale. We also demonstrate that the deblurring the Gaussian blur is equivalent to solving simple systems of linear, simultaneous equations and is computationally efficient.

Reference-contexts: In general, D N (x) does not converge to any function as N tends to infinity, and the use of a deblur kernel of high degree (large N ) produces a ringing effect in the reconstruction of natural 5 images. More recently, Zucker and Kimia <ref> [4] </ref> attempt an analytical inversion procedure for discrete time signals.

For image representation, we choose a wavelet arrray composed of the generalized Hermite functions 5 parametrized by two scale factors (one for each spatial variable). <p> We also demonstrate that the deblurring the Gaussian blur is equivalent to solving simple systems of linear, simultaneous equations and is computationally efficient. Further, we can also apply the ideas of Zucker and Kimia <ref> [4] </ref> and analytically invert the matrix involved in our system of linear equations (although no LDU decomposition is needed due to the simple structure of our matrix). 1.4 Mathematical Preliminaries for the New Approach In what follows, R denotes the real line and R n , the Cartesian n-product of R <p> Remark 2 : While solving the system of linear equations A j = b, we can use the ideas of Zucker and Kimia <ref> [4] </ref> and analytically invert the A j matrix, which is easy in the present case because (a) A j is upper triangular ; and (b) even in the super-diagonal entries in the matrix, zeros alternate with non-zeroes in every row and every column.

Remark 3 : Zucker and Kimia [4] study the effect of changes in the blur variance on the reconstruction. Their empirical results show that when the deblurring variance parameter exactly matches the blur variance, perfect reconstruction is achieved (in the absence of noise) by using high precision arithmetic.

Reference-contexts: The inversion may work well with high precision arithmetic only for signals with little or no noise, but is not robust with respect to noise.

Reference-contexts: It is likely that this class contains functions with appropriate smoothness restrictions. 5 For an explanation of the superiority (for certain classes of reconstruction problems) of Hermite functions, in signal representation, over other orthogonal schemes (like Gabor), see <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> Thus, it appears that the Hermite functions provide a natural framework to analyse Gaussian deblurring and other related problems in signal and image processing. These functions have already been used successfully for problems in signal reconstruction using partial information <ref> [7] </ref>. 6 Experimental Results This section presents, briefly, the results of the proposed deblurring algorithm on a typical image (see Fig.1). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deblurring algorithm on two images obtained by blurring (corresponding to two different values of ) the image of Fig.1.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of using a wavelet array representation lies in the ability to control the shape of the resolution cell. By having appropriate Hermite functions as components of a wavelet array, it is possible to simultaneously control (within restrictions governed by the Uncertainty Principle <ref> [11] </ref>), the space-bandwidth product and the space-bandwidth ratio of the basis functions and arrive at fairly arbitrary tilings of the space-frequency plane (see [12],and [13]).

Reference-contexts: However, in practice, we find it convenient to do so. No special advantage seems to be gained by varying the number of terms across scales or in the expansions of f and g. 7 Convergence conditions are analysed in a separate paper <ref> [12] </ref>. 8 In what follows, it is assumed that the blur parameter in the blur model (1) is known. 11 With minor modifications, results given below are valid for the general case, too.

This advantage, not realizable in the standard wavelet tiling, can be very useful when some information is available a priori, about the space-frequency energy distribution of the signal.
