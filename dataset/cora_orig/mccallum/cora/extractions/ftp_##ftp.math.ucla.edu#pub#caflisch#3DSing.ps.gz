Abstract: Moore's approximation method, first formulated for vortex sheets, is generalized and applied to axi-symmetric flow with swirl and with smooth initial data. The approximation preserves the forward cascade of energy but neglects any backflow of energy. It splits the Euler equations into two sets of equations: one for u + = u + (r; z; t) containing all non-negative wavenumbers (in z) and the second for u = u + . The equations for u + are exactly the Euler equations but with complex initial data. Traveling waves solutions u + = u + (r; z it) with imaginary wave speed are found numerically for this problem. The asymptotic properties of the resulting Fourier coefficients show a singularity form ing in finite time at which the velocity blows up.

The complex-analytic approach to singularities used here follows similar earlier investigations on a variety of simpler problems; including the Kelvin-Helmholtz problem [14, 25, 27, 28, 35], the Rayleigh-Taylor problem <ref> [5, 29, 30, 42] </ref>, the Hele-Shaw problem [22, 41], and nonlinear hyperbolic or elliptic systems with exactly 2 speeds [11].

Reference-contexts: This establishes that if any smoothness is lost at time t fl , then in fact R t fl 0 max x j!jdt 0 = 1. A similar result, that loss of analyticity implies blowup of vorticity, was proved by Bardos & Benachour <ref> [6] </ref>. For inviscid, incompressible flow in two dimensions, an initially smooth velocity field u (x ; 0) will stay smooth for all time due to the conservation of vorticity.

Reference-contexts: Moreover singularities, which can be described through a small number of parameters, may provide the simplest possible description of a complex flow. The main analytic result on singularity formation in 3D is that of Beale, Kato & Majda <ref> [7] </ref>, who showed that ku (; t)k s (ku (; 0)k s ; 0 x for some smooth function and for any Sobolev norm k k s with s 3. <p> Second for a traveling wave solution, time t and axial position z are linearly related. The time integral of vorticity is thus related to a spatial integral of vorticity which is a velocity. Therefore the Beale-Kato-Majda result <ref> [7] </ref> that R t max j!jdt ! 1 at a singularity should imply ju j ! 1 at this singularity, in agreement with the results above. Third the circulation remains bounded, as indicated in Figure 10.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand Moore's approximation can be easily used to show that singularities do not form in the original problem if they do not form for Moore's approximation, since ignoring the energy backflow biases the problem in favor of singularity formation.

In [32] however an adaptive numerical method, with nonlinear scaling of x and t, was used on an asymptotically reduced equation to produce singularities for axi-symmetric flow with swirl. Some critical remarks on this results are presented in [43]. <p> The singularities found in this study correspond to infinite values of the radial and axial velocity and occur at the centers of these rolls. In contrast the singularities of Pumir and Siggia <ref> [32] </ref> occur at the tips of the outward jet. 3 The motivation for considering complex-valued velocity fields comes from a generalization of Moore's approximation. <p> This shows that the singularities occur at the centers of the rolls, which will also be verified through analysis of the Fourier coefficients. This is in contrast to the computations of Pumir & Siggia <ref> [32] </ref> and of Grauer & Sideris [20], in which the greatest amplification of vorticity and possible singularities occur at the tip of the outward jet.

Reference-contexts: The special solution u + (r; z; t) found here is a traveling wave u + = u + (r; z it) with an imaginary wave speed, which is motivated by the traveling wave solutions discovered by Siegel <ref> [37] </ref> for Moore's approximation to the Rayleigh-Taylor problem.

Reference-contexts: The computation is performed for f k (r), the k-wavenumber (in z) component of the radial velocity. There is no singularity in f k (r) for finite k; rather singularities are detected through the asymptotic properties of f k as k ! 1, as in <ref> [40] </ref>. This procedure is described in Section 6. The resulting singularity in the radial velocity u r has the form u r in which and are orthogonal spatial coordinates and t is a scaled time coordinate, all centered at the singularity. <p> As shown in <ref> [40] </ref>, this implies that the Fourier coefficients f k will have the asymptotic form f k for k &gt;&gt; 1.
