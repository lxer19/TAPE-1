Abstract: In [6], Thomassen conjectured that if I is a set of k 1 arcs in a k-strong tournament T , then T I has a Hamiltonian cycle. This conjecture was proved by Fraisse and Thomassen [3]. We prove the following stronger result. Let T = (V; A) be a k-strong tournament on n vertices and let X 1 ; X 2 ; : : :; X l be a partition of the vertex set V of T such that jX 1 j jX 2 j : : : jX l j. If k

Reference-contexts: There exists an integer circulation f in N such that `(a) f (a) c (a) for all a 2 A if and only if c ( X; X) `(X; X ) for all proper subsets X of V . For a proof of this theorem, see for example <ref> [2, page 50] </ref>. We finish this section by the following simple but useful lemma. The proof is left for the reader.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In [6], Thomassen conjectured that if I is a set of k 1 arcs in a k-strong tournament T , then T I has a Hamiltonian cycle. This conjecture was proved by Fraisse and Thomassen <ref> [3] </ref>. This result is sharp since the deletion of a set I of k arcs from a k-strong tournament may create a vertex of indegree or outdegree 0.
