Title: Reasoned Assumptions and Rational Psychology  
Author: Jon Doyle 
Address: Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, U.S.A.  
Affiliation: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Laboratory for Computer Science  
Note: Fundamenta Informaticae V. 20, Nos. 1-3 (Spring 1994), pp. 35-73 Submitted 11/93  For Joseph A. Schatz, teacher and friend  
Abstract: Logical epistemology unduly sways theories of thinking that formulate problems of nonmonotonic reasoning as issues of nondeductive operations on logically phrased beliefs, because the fundamental concepts underlying such reasoning have little to do with logic or belief. These formulations make the resulting theories inappropriately special and hide the characteristic structures of nonmonotonic reasoning amid many unrelated structures. We present a more direct mathematical development of nonmonotonic reasoning free of extraneous logical and epistemological assumptions, and argue that the insights gained in this way exemplify the benefits obtained by approaching psychology as a subject for mathematical investigation through the discipline of rational psychology.
