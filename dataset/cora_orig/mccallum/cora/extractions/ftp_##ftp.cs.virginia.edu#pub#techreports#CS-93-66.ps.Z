Title: Evaluating Cryptographic Protocols 1 11/7/93 EVALUATING CRYPTOGRAPHIC PROTOCOLS four major categories of mechanisms as: 1

Abstract: Cryptographic Protocol (CP) analysis is a topic of intense research. Meadows describes four approaches for CP verification under investigation in [MEA92] and several authors have categorized protocols based on types of errors they are subject to [BIRD92], [SYV93a],[SYV93b]. This paper addresses the weakness injected into protocols when information is passed in the clear or encrypted only under the private key of a public/private key pair. We also propose a method for logically analyzing protocols based on action list analysis of valid and compromised protocol runs and of valid protocol runs interleaved with action lists of intruders con In [NS78] Needham and Schroeder lay the foundation for research in the field now known as Cryptographic Protocol Verification (CPV). In that paper, the authors present cryptographic protocols for systems with authentication servers for shared and public key authentication and for what is now known as digital signatures. Those protocols effectively highlight many of the important issues in cryptographic protocols. They are used in practice, and in literature for purposes of illustration. In 1981, Denning and Sacco [DENN81] pointed out a subtle error in the Needham and Schroeder private key protocol, setting the stage for a ood of research aimed at examining cryptographic protocols. In [BAN90] Burrows, Abadi, and Needham make a giant step forward in resolving the CPV problem. The Logic of Authentication (hereafter called BAN Logic) they propose has achieved widespread acceptance as the de facto standard system for CPV, and has been the target of enhancements and supplements by various authors [GNY90], [AT91], [SYV93a]. While BAN Logic is widely accepted, Nessetts paper [NESS90] demonstrated a weakness in the use of BAN Logic for protocol verification. This triggered broad and often spirited discussions regarding cryptographic protocol goals, environments, and other categorizations [BAN90b], [SYV91], [SNEK91]. Moreover, in much the same way as Denning and Sacco [DENN81] opened Pandoras box for examining cryptographic protocols, [NESS90] challenged the very mechanisms used to evaluate protocols and triggered intense research in suitable CPV mechanisms[BAN90b], [SYV91], [SNEK91]. As a result, CPV mechanisms are now subjected to the same level of scrutiny as the protocols they evaluate. Several fundamentally different mechanisms have evolved in the research. ducting known attacks.

Reference-contexts: In considering whether or not to use cleartext messages in protocols, one must consider performance implications. A stated reason for conducting BAN Logic evaluations in <ref> [BAN90] </ref> is to identify unnecessary encryption operations. It is also true that adding encryption operations also adds to the complexity of the protocol operations and possibly to the assumptions that must be made. The trade-off of performance for security must be judged by the user of the protocol.

Reference-contexts: Though the vulnerability in this protocol results largely from the structure of the messages in the protocol, cleartext contributed to the weakness. We now describe how cleartext messages themselves present problems in cryptographic protocols. In <ref> [NESS90] </ref> Nessett points out that BAN Logic does not have predicates to reect the lack of secrecy of information passed in a protocol session. The authors of BAN indicate that information passed in the clear is not considered when idealizing the protocol because it can be forged [BAN89, p 330]. <p> Unfortunately, though cleartext messages cannot add to the security of protocols, they can easily compromise that security if, for example, a cleartext message contains a key that is believed to be good by some participant in the current protocol run. This is effectively what Nessett does in <ref> [NESS90] </ref>, passing a key encrypted under only the principals private key of a public/private key pair, having virtually the same effect as passing the key in the clear. Cleartext transmission also plays a part in the attack Syverson describes on the Neuman-Stubblebine protocol in [SYV93b]. <p> These interleavings, which are nothing more than different versions of the protocol, can be mechanically evaluated in a standard method, such as BAN Logic. We believe the evaluation of these interleavings satisfies the need for the predicate suggested by Nessett <ref> [NESS90] </ref> that describes the secrecy of information passed in the protocol run.

Reference-contexts: This fact allows us to construct traces using action lists other than those intended by the creator of the protocol. Specifically, we may desire to interleave action lists extracted from specified protocols with action lists derived from traces of known attacks <ref> [BIRD90, SYV93a] </ref>. These interleavings, which are nothing more than different versions of the protocol, can be mechanically evaluated in a standard method, such as BAN Logic.

Reference-contexts: Cleartext transmission also plays a part in the attack Syverson describes on the Neuman-Stubblebine protocol in <ref> [SYV93b] </ref>. In that attack, the fact that the nonce is sent in the clear in the first message allows the intruder to compromise the protocol by later utilizing the nonce as a key. In considering whether or not to use cleartext messages in protocols, one must consider performance implications.
