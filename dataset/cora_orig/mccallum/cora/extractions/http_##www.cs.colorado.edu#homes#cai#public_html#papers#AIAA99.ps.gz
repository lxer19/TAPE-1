Abstract: In this paper we present a multi-domain multi-model formulation for three-dimensional compressible flows. Using multi-domains we can map the computation efficiently onto multi-processor parallel computers and using multi-models we can reduce the arithmetic cost. The goal is to minimize the overall time and memory required to simulate the flow by using locally selected, more computational efficient physical models without sacrificing the global fidelity of the simulation. We introduce a finite volume based conservative interpolation for the coupling of the full potential equation and the Euler equations, and the resulting nonlinear systems are solved by a Defect Correction method. To demonstrate the feasibility of this method, we present computational results for subsonic and transonic flows around wings, and also a comparison with results obtained using the TRANAIR package of Boeing.

Reference-contexts: Recall that the full potential equation assumes irrotational flow and constant entropy. This suggests that incoming information for the Euler domain must be provided. For three-dimensional flows, it is shown in <ref> [1, 21] </ref> that the computational cost can be reduced by a factor of two for a Navier-Stokes/full potential coupling. This method was enhanced with the addition of a Lagrangian wake to include the wake effect in the full potential region in order to study its unsteady behavior. <p> In general, the cost of the full potential solver can be considered negligible compared to the Navier-Stokes solver. The solution strategy is based on solving the different equations alternatively in each region, similar to a subdomain iterative method. Our formulation differs from <ref> [1, 21] </ref> in providing a general finite volume approach and therefore ensures that the mass will also remain conserved at the discrete level. In addition, an unstructured discretization of the computational domain provides more flexibility to mesh complex geometries and for adaptive control of the numerical error.

Reference-contexts: Suppose we know an initial guess for U n+1;0 , say U n . To obtain U n+1 we solve (5) using the so-called Defect Correction (DeC) method <ref> [2] </ref> and form the following linear system of equations i k h @ (1st) h ) U n+1;s+1 h = (U h U n ko c t n + h (U h ) : 3 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Clearly, this approach reduces to Newton's method in the limit <p> Note that ae i;j , the discrete density, is a function of (r) i;j which is a constant for each element o i;j . 2.3.2 Implicit approach To solve (8) we introduce a pseudo-time step. Hence, we rewrite (8) as d Z i Z i Using the DeC method <ref> [2, 17] </ref>, the resulting semi-discrete form of (10) is i k h @( (1st) @ h n+1;s i h n ko c t n + h ( n+1;s ) ; where h is the discrete mass flux.

Reference-contexts: In addition, an unstructured discretization of the computational domain provides more flexibility to mesh complex geometries and for adaptive control of the numerical error. Lastly, a parallel version is implemented to obtain reasonable execution time. In <ref> [6] </ref>, initial steps of this research were taken. We presented the derivation and implementation of the interface condition between the full potential equation and the Euler equations. <p> To conclude, each of the s DeC iterations of the (n + 1)st time step is solved using a diagonally preconditioned GMRES approach. 2.3 Full potential solver A finite volume full potential solver has been developed to interface with our existing Euler solver <ref> [6] </ref>. In the resulting composite discretization, the same control volume is used and only the flux calculations are different. <p> This time step is adopted to have the same diagonal scaling in the Jaco-bian matrix associated with the coupled solver.

Reference-contexts: Jacobian matrix J is ill-conditioned and Krylov methods need a large number of iterations. It is clear that the introduction of a preconditioner is mandatory. A Krylov-Schwarz method, such as a restricted additive Schwarz <ref> [7] </ref> preconditioned GMRES, is being studied in part because of good data locality which is an advantage for parallel computing. Other more practical issues are related to automate the multi-model formulation leading to additional reduction in computation time and memory. <p> We have showed herein the extension of the explicit multi-model formulation to an implicit approach. At this point we note that both the linear and the nonlinear convergence are slow. Implementation of a restricted additive Schwarz <ref> [7] </ref> should improve the linear convergence. Further research is needed to analyze and improve the nonlinear convergence.
