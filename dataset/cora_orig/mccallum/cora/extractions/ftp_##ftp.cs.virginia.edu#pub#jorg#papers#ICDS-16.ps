Abstract: The Available-Bit-Rate (ABR) service that is being standardized by the ATM Forum dynamically determines the maximum transmission rate, the explicit rate, of a connection. A drawback of the dynamic control scheme for calculating the explicit rates is that it tries to allocate the same bandwidth to all ABR connections regardless of the application type of the connection. In this study a multi-level explicit rate scheme is proposed that can allocate different transmission rates bounds to connections. ABR traffic is controlled at three levels. At the topmost level, bandwidth is dynamically regulated between CBR, VBR, and ABR traffic sources. At the next level, bandwidth is controlled between different classes of ABR traffic. At the lowest level, bandwidth is distributed among connections belonging to the same ABR traffic class. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated in simulation experiments.

Reference-contexts: In this study we address the problem of determining the explicit rate for ABR connections in an ATM network with rate-based traffic control. The ATM Forum has adopted the so-called max-min fairness or bottleneck flow control <ref> [1, 4] </ref> scheme as objective for the rate control algorithm [5, 10]. Max-min fairness attempts to give each ABR connection the same maximum throughput allocation on each link in the network.

Rate-based traffic control in ATM consists of a closed feedback loop involving the source end system, the destination end system, and the intermediate ATM switches. The basic steps of the control loop are shown in Figure 1.

With fixed class capacities, such a bandwidth control scheme is identical to max-min fairness, a scheme that has been considered for ABR traffic control in several different versions <ref> [5] </ref>. We determine the values of the maximal fair shares as follows. Given the share values on each link (not necessarily maximal), we partition the set of class-p ABR connections on a link l into three groups: underloaded connections, overloaded connections, and restricted connections.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Available-Bit-Rate (ABR) service class currently being defined by the ATM Forum <ref> [10] </ref> completes the suite of services available in ATM networks. The goal of the ABR service is to efficiently support traffic types that were traditionally carried in packet switching networks, i.e., highly bursty traffic with only vaguely defined quality-of-service requirements. <p> In this study we address the problem of determining the explicit rate for ABR connections in an ATM network with rate-based traffic control. The ATM Forum has adopted the so-called max-min fairness or bottleneck flow control [1, 4] scheme as objective for the rate control algorithm <ref> [5, 10] </ref>. Max-min fairness attempts to give each ABR connection the same maximum throughput allocation on each link in the network. <p> The current draft version of the Traffic Management document <ref> [10] </ref> uses more than two dozen parameters for the control algorithm.

The ATM switches reduce the value in the ER field and return the RM cell back to the source. <p> When the RM cell returns, the ER field contains the maximum traffic rate that is permitted by the network. The actual implementation of the feedback control loop proposed by the ATM Forum is too complex to be presented here <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> new connection j: P X X MCR i C min 4 Protocol Mechanisms for Multi-level Bandwidth Control In this section we present how the proposed multilevel bandwidth control scheme from the previous section can be incorporated into the framework of the ABR traffic management protocol developed by the ATM Forum <ref> [10] </ref>.

The only addition to the RM cell format is the following field: BNK The Bottleneck (BNK) Field contains a unique identification of an ATM switch or the destination system and identifies the bottleneck link of the connection. <p> The simulations were implemented using the REAL (version 4.0) network simulator [6]. The implementation of the source, destination, and switch behavior of the ABR traffic control protocol is based on the Traffic Management Specification Version 4.0 from November 1995 <ref> [10] </ref>. We do not consider the effects of higher-level protocols. As shown in Figure 2, the simulated network consists of four source end systems S1 - S4 and four destination end systems D1 - D4.
