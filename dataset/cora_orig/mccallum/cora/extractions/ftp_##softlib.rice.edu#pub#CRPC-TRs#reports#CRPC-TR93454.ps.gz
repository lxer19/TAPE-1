Title: BALANCING DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION FOR MIXED FINITE ELEMENTS  
Author: LAWRENCE C. COWSAR, JAN MANDEL, AND MARY F. WHEELER 
Abstract: The rate of convergence of the Balancing Domain Decomposition method applied to the mixed finite element discretization of second order elliptic equations is analyzed. The Balancing Domain Decomposition method, introduced by Mandel in [24], is a substructuring method that involves at each iteration the solution of a local problem with Dirichlet data, a local problem with Neumann data, and a "coarse grid" problem to propagate information globally and to insure the consistency of the Neumann problems. It is shown that the condition number grows at worst like the logarithm squared of the ratio of the subdomain size to the element size, in both two and three dimensions and for elements of arbitrary order. The bounds are uniform with respect to coefficient jumps of arbitrary size between subdomains. The key component of our analysis is the demonstration of an equivalence between the norm induced by the bilinear form on the interface and the H 1=2 -norm of an interpolant of the boundary data. Computational results from a message passing parallel implementation on an INTEL-Delta machine demonstrate the scalability properties of the method and show almost optimal linear observed speed-up for up to 64 processors.

Reference-contexts: In mixed finite element approximations to (1.1)-(1.2) both the scalar variable, p, and its flux, Arp, are approximated. Used since the 1950's in their earliest incarnation as cell-centered finite differences (cf. [31]), mixed finite elements methods continue to be used in industrial problems (e.g. <ref> [18] </ref>) because of their inherent mass conservation properties and their high quality approximation of both the scalar variable and its flux. As is well known, the mixed formulation gives rise to a saddle point problem that is symmetric but indefinite.

Reference-contexts: To evaluate the parallel performance of the BDD algorithm, we consider a model "industrial-type" problem arising from the pressure equation in one time-step of a miscible flow simulation with mobility ratio of 100, see <ref> [29] </ref>. In this test problem, the domain was = (0; 1) fi (0; 1) fi (0; 1=8) and was discretized with a grid with 128 fi 64 fi 8 elements. The aspect ratio is typical of porous media flow problems.

Reference-contexts: In mixed finite element approximations to (1.1)-(1.2) both the scalar variable, p, and its flux, Arp, are approximated. Used since the 1950's in their earliest incarnation as cell-centered finite differences (cf. <ref> [31] </ref>), mixed finite elements methods continue to be used in industrial problems (e.g. [18]) because of their inherent mass conservation properties and their high quality approximation of both the scalar variable and its flux. <p> on the domain IR 3 with boundary @ = @ D [ @ N : ra (x)rp = f in ;(7.1) rp- = g N on @ N :(7.3) Equations (7.1)-(7.3) were discretized using finite differences which is the lowest-order Raviart-Thomas-Nedelec space defined on rectangular solids in 3D with quadrature <ref> [31] </ref>. In all of our experiments, the mesh spacing in each coordinate direction was uniform and the spaces Z i in (5.20) where chosen as the constant functions on @ i regardless of external boundary conditions.

The following lemma is essentially Lemma 4.3 of [6] except that the support of j is not wholly contained @ i T @ j but rather in a region overlapping neighboring faces of @ j by O (h). Lemma 6.4.
