Abstract: We explore techniques from visualization and computational geometry to make tactical information more intuitive to a military commander. To be successful, the commander must quickly grasp, and react to, changes in the evolving battle. Thus the commander must possess good situation awareness (SA). A particular problem is to reduce the information complexity entailed by understanding the positional and evolutionary potential of the many individual entities (micro states), each with its own organizational allegiance, capabilities, and attributes. The challenge is to combine the many individual microstates into a few integrated macrostates and then display this information to the commander in a way that is instantly meaningful. To improve the acquisition of SA, we apply principles of human visual perception. In particular, we exploit the organizational properties of gestalt figures and the phenomenon of global preference to create displays that allow the commander to quickly find and integrate relevant information on the location, identity, and concentration of friendly and enemy units. We postulate that an appropriate technical translation of this psychological concept is to consider the spatial arrangement of the units as a geometric density assignment problem, based, to the first order, on geometric proximity. The resulting density and clustering of units is represented using color. To further enhance the ability to grasp the evolving dynamics of an engagement, we compress the data into a short temporal sequence of images. For example, several days of maneuver may be compressed into a motion sequence of a few minutes. We report preliminary findings focusing on the computational geometry aspects, and on the visualization requirements.

Reference-contexts: The brute-force implementation of this approach is much more expensive than the triangle-based direct shading, but there are many possibilities to increase efficiency. One possibility is hierarchical decomposition used in N-body algorithms <ref> [1] </ref>. Moreover, the computation is inherently parallel. Finally, improvements are also possible by applying interpolation techniques at the raster level. Blobby shading provides a highly intuitive presentation of the density distribution.

Reference-contexts: So, the visual images of clusters look polygonal especially when there are only a few points. 3.2 Blobby Shading Blobby shading was motivated by molecule visualization, where the electron in an atom is represented as a density function of the spatial location; <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Another attractive property is that Delaunay triangulation has been widely studied and can be implemented in a numerically stable way; <ref> [10, 3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The best insertion and deletion algorithms use randomization techniques, where insertion takes O (log n) expected time and deletion takes O (log log n) expected time. The algorithms require maintaining an extra search structure, such as the Delaunay tree, besides the triangulation; <ref> [4] </ref>. The search structure is used for locating the triangle into which the point should be re-inserted. Library implementations, such as LEDA or CGAL, have chosen a more straightforward but less sophisticated implementation for this.

Reference-contexts: It is observed that triangulations satisfying these criteria give us a better approximation when the height value has a preferred direction; <ref> [5] </ref>. Density, at each point, is approximated from the triangulation by summing a quantized edge length for every incident edge and then scaling this value to a predetermined range that is based on an exponential quantization of the edge length sum.

Reference-contexts: Having a density assignment at each point, we wish to update it efficiently as it moves about. Computational geometry shows that this type of problem can be reduced to the Voronoi diagram problem, or its dual, the Delaunay triangulation. Both topics have been researched extensively in computational geometry; e.g., <ref> [6] </ref>. In following sections, we will explain how these techniques can be adapted to our application, and what performance results have been achieved so far. 2 Three Approaches to Density We assign to each point a height, reducing density rendering to the problem of terrain rendering.

Reference-contexts: Then, two decades ago, it was demonstrated that people extract the global aspects of a scene before smaller (local) details 1 are perceived; <ref> [9, 7] </ref>. Thus, global aspects of a scene have processing dominance over local elements. Not only does global perception precede feature-by-feature analysis, it is also thought to be pre-attentive in that it occurs without the cognitive effort characteristic of a serial search and analysis of individual elements.

Reference-contexts: Library implementations, such as LEDA or CGAL, have chosen a more straightforward but less sophisticated implementation for this. Instead of maintaining an extra search structure, they use segment walking to locate points, update the triangulation locally, and finally perform consecutive Delaunay flipping to reestablish the Delaunay property; <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction 1.1 Applying the Theory of Perception Early in the 20th-century, gestalt psychologists observed that when elements were gathered into a figure, the figure took on a perceptual salience that ex ceeded the sum of its parts; <ref> [11] </ref>. Then, two decades ago, it was demonstrated that people extract the global aspects of a scene before smaller (local) details 1 are perceived; [9, 7]. Thus, global aspects of a scene have processing dominance over local elements.
