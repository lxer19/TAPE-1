Title: An Analysis of the Effects of Neighborhood Size and Shape on Local Selection Algorithms  
Author: Jayshree Sarma and Kenneth De Jong 
Address: Fairfax, VA 22030  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department George Mason University  
Abstract: The increasing availability of finely-grained parallel architectures has resulted in a variety of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) in which the population is spatially distributed and local selection algorithms operate in parallel on small, overlapping neighborhoods. The effects of design choices regarding the particular type of local selection algorithm as well as the size and shape of the neighborhood are not particularly well understood and are generally tested empirically. In this paper we extend the techniques used to more formally analyze selection methods for sequential EAs and apply them to local neighborhood models, resulting in a much clearer understanding of the effects of neighborhood size and shape.

Reference-contexts: for linear ranking selection using constant radius ratios. local neighborhood models are well approximated by a logistic equation of the form: N = 1 + ( N fl where N fl is the asymptotic value of N for very large t and N 0 is the initial value of N <ref> [3] </ref>. Since in our case we know that N fl is 1:0 we can rewrite the equation as: 1 P b;0 1)e at where a is the growth coefficient and P b;t is the proportion of the best in the pop-ulation at time t.

Reference-contexts: Having some insights as to how the selection pressure can be varied in local neighborhood EAs will help in designing better parallel EAs. In De Jong and Sarma 1995 <ref> [5] </ref> we studied the emergent global selection pressure induced on the entire population by standard local selection algorithms. <p> The intuitive explanation for this phenomenon is that it is the result of the combined effects of logistic growth occurring in each of the local neighborhoods and the propagation times necessary to spread the best individual globally throughout a spatially structured population. In De Jong and Sarma 1995 <ref> [5] </ref> we confirmed the first of these two hypotheses showing that the emergent global selection pressure of a local selection algorithm such as fitness proportional or linear ranking selection is qualitatively similar to that produced by fitness proportional or linear ranking in standard serial EAs with global mating pools.
