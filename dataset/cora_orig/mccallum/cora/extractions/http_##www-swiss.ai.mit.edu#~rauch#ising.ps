Reference-contexts: A cluster's intersection by a straight line is a collection of occupied sites separated by gaps. It was reported in [2] that the sizes of sufficiently distant gaps in percolation clusters are statistically independent. Ref. <ref> [1] </ref> reported that the numbers of sites in antipodal "pie-slice" sections are independent asymptotically. This is a new property; seasoned physicists made no prediction on this account, or made predictions in conflict with our finding. <p> In fact, the renormalization test indicates that for asymptotics are reached quite rapidly. A limitation of the linear cuts is that they miss much of the clusters' planar and spatial structure. This is addressed by a second test, pioneered in <ref> [1] </ref> and applied here in Section 6. 5 Asymptotic Gap Independence along Cuts: A Renormalization Test As background to our first test, it is known that the gaps of a Levy dust follow the scaling probability distribution Pr (t i t) / t ff . <p> The high degree of overlap of the normalized curves is evidence that, as for percolation clusters, the Ising gaps are independent. 6 Antipodal Absence of Correlation: Ob servations The analysis of percolation clusters in <ref> [1] </ref> used another new, otherwise untried method of analysis, based on the antipodal correlation. We find that the antipodal correlation vanishes for Ising clusters. We examined both the boundaries and the whole clusters. <p> The average value over 7000 clusters is C L (; ) = 0:2429 0:0087. This result is due to the large holes on the clus 13 ter and their inhomogeneous distribution. The average C L (; ) is slightly smaller than <ref> [1] </ref> found in percolation clusters. It may be that our periodic boundary conditions better mimic the thermodynamic limit and allow the growth of clusters larger than a free lattice. One must, however, keep in mind that antipodal correlation is meaningful only when 1 &lt;< R &lt;< L. <p> Figure 8A plots the antipodal anticorrelations for boxes of fixed side R = 19; 39; 79 and 139, as function of L. This plot shows a strong decay for small values of L and a plateau for large L. We agree with Ref <ref> [1] </ref> in viewing the minimum for a value of L close to 1000 as a random fluctuation. The lattice size effects are explored in figure 8B, where the previous data are replotted as a function of the rescaled lattice size L=R. <p> When C0, the lacunarity is said to be low, and to decrease as C tends to 1. When C0, the lacunarity is said to be high, and to 15 increase as C tends to -1. Evidence that critical percolation clusters have neutral lacunarity was found in <ref> [1] </ref>, where antipodal correlation was found to vanish and [2], where gap independence was demonstrated. The results given here thus suggest that critical Ising clusters also possess a neutral lacunarity.

Reference-contexts: While the preceding questions have been raised previously, a new problem arose recently for percolation clusters, that of asymptotic independence. A cluster's intersection by a straight line is a collection of occupied sites separated by gaps. It was reported in <ref> [2] </ref> that the sizes of sufficiently distant gaps in percolation clusters are statistically independent. Ref. [1] reported that the numbers of sites in antipodal "pie-slice" sections are independent asymptotically. This is a new property; seasoned physicists made no prediction on this account, or made predictions in conflict with our finding. <p> We used for the Ising clusters the renormalization test pioneered in <ref> [2] </ref> and the answer is also in the affirmative. Let us show that gap independence helps understand what is meant by saying that long-range structure prevails at criticality. <p> This independence is not a necessary consequence of long-range structure alone. In fact, one of us (BBM) has constructed explicit examples where a strong dependence is preserved asymptotically. Now, we return from known mathematical constructs to physics. The result in <ref> [2] </ref> and in Section 5 below show that linear cuts through the percolation and Ising clusters also have this property of asymptotic independence. In fact, the renormalization test indicates that for asymptotics are reached quite rapidly. <p> In this case we expect N b also to decay as s ff1 for sufficiently large s (and to have some non-trivial structure when s becomes of order b 1=ff ). From this distribution, as in <ref> [2] </ref> we then normalize the distribution of such b-gaps for each b and compare the renormalized curves to each other, and to the known theoretical distribution. with the crosscuts (horizontal and vertical) taken 20 sites apart. <p> When C0, the lacunarity is said to be high, and to 15 increase as C tends to -1. Evidence that critical percolation clusters have neutral lacunarity was found in [1], where antipodal correlation was found to vanish and <ref> [2] </ref>, where gap independence was demonstrated. The results given here thus suggest that critical Ising clusters also possess a neutral lacunarity. Application of low la-cunarity fractals and the physical meaning of lacunarity, especially of neutral lacunarity, is touched upon in Ref.[], and will be discussed elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: But for the purpose of this section, we wanted large free-standing clusters. The algorithm is stopped when the cluster has become large but does not touch the sides. Our simulations (Fig. 1) show that critical Ising clusters conform to the Fisher droplet model <ref> [3] </ref>, and differ from percolation clusters in several ways: A) The Ising cluster in Figure 1, and many analogous figures we have drawn, are multiply connected throughout; B) The presence of many indentations that can be closed by flipping the value of a single site [6] is a characteristic property of

Reference-contexts: Faced with this problem in the context of financial time series, one of us [BBM] pioneered a renormalization method that selects a base b and defines "b-gaps", each of which is made of b successive 1D gaps <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, a family of fractals may share the same D yet differ sharply, as shown in Ref. <ref> [8] </ref>, Chapters 34 and 35. A property of fractals called lacunarity characterizes the distribution of gaps or holes in a fractal. This notion is distinct and independent from D; it is not related with the topology of the fractal and needs more than one numerical variable to be fully determined.

Reference-contexts: Recently, one of us discovered that the antipodal correlation affects lacunarity <ref> [9] </ref>, and so provides a numerical characteristic of this property. Three cases are to be distinguished. When the antipodal correlation C vanishes, the fractal is said to be of neutral lacunarity. When C0, the lacunarity is said to be low, and to decrease as C tends to 1.
