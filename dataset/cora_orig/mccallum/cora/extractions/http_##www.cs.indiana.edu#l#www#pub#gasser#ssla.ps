Title: In Studies in Second Language Acquisition,  Connectionism and Universals of Second Language Acquisition  
Author: Michael Gasser

Abstract: This paper examines the implications of connectionist models of cognition for second language theory. Connectionism offers a challenge to the symbolic models which dominate cognitive science. In connectionist models all knowledge is embodied in a network of simple processing units joined by connections which are strengthened or weakened in response to regularities in input patterns. These models avoid the brittleness of symbolic approaches, and they exhibit rule-like behavior without explicit rules. A connectionist framework is proposed within which hypotheses about second language acquisition can be tested. Inputs and outputs are patterns of activation on units representing both form and meaning. Learning consists of the unsupervised association of pattern elements with one another. A network is first trained on a set of first language patterns and then exposed to a set of second language patterns with the same meanings. Several simulations of constituent-order transfer within this framework are discussed.

Reference-contexts: While provision for some modularity in connectionist models seems to be on the rise, it is unlikely that connectionists will accept the extreme position of some generativists <ref> (e.g., Fodor, 1983) </ref>. One of the strong points of connectionism is its ability to model decisions made on the basis of the interaction of a variety of types of information. Thus connectionists tend to be interactionalists rather than modularists.

What I will propose in this section is a framework which is consistent with much connectionist thinking and also with the basic tenets of cognitive linguistics, the approach which is the most compatible with connectionism.

Reference-contexts: Thus connectionists tend to be interactionalists rather than modularists. This goes as well for the (non-)distinction between linguistic and nonlinguistic cognitive behavior, and it is also in agreement with the views of cognitive linguists <ref> (Langacker, 1987) </ref>. While connectionism is not consistent with most generative notions of universals, it is not incompatible with various proposals for processing universals. The best-known of these are probably Slobins operating principles (Slobin, 1973).

Elmans model made no use of ccommand or any other complex symbolic notion; indeed, there is probably no way his network could have been designed to incorporate such notions.

Reference-contexts: The differences lie in the concern of connectionists with the internal representations that are constructed between the inputs from and the outputs to the environment and with the specific mental processes that are involved in the construction of these representations <ref> (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986a) </ref>. <p> Two areas in which candidate universals might be considered are 1) the relative modifiability of particular connections and 2) the architecture of the network. These are aspects of a system that one would want to assume it is born with. One view <ref> (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986a) </ref> is that connections might have varying degrees of plasticity (though this is not a feature of most existing models). Some connections might start with fixed weights and others with weights that are modifiable to different degrees.

Reference-contexts: It appears that connectionist models may be able to shed new light on the nativism issue because of their ability to outperform previously conceived empirical systems <ref> (Walker, 1989) </ref>. Two models relevant to language acquisition in particular are those of Hanson and Kegl (1987) and Elman (1988).
