Abstract: We consider the problem of navigating through an unknown envi-roment in which the obstacles are convex, and each contains a circle of diameter 1. The task is to reach a given straight line, in the distance n from our original position. Our randomized algorithm has competitive ratio n 0:75 , and it uses tactile information only. This is the first algorithm that offers any competitive ratio for the problem.

Reference-contexts: One example is the room problem: the target in the center of a square containing all the obstacles, and the start at the perimeter. If obstacles are oriented rectangles, the competitive ratio for deterministic algorithms is fi (log n) (see <ref> [1] </ref>). If obstacles are convex, Blum et al. [3] show the deterministic lower bound (n 1=2 ) and randomized upper bound O (n 1=2 ) (both bounds assume that the robot receives the visual information).

Reference-contexts: In the wall problem, introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [7], the target is an infinite straight line. If the obstacles are oriented rect 1 angles, then the competitive ratio for deterministic algorithms is fi (n 1=2 ) (see [3]). Recently, <ref> [2] </ref>, an randomized algorithm was found that is better than the deterministic lower bound. If the obstacles are arbitrary convex figures, no better lower bound is known, but no matching competitive ratio was obtained.

Reference-contexts: One can also formulate a motion planning problem in a graph, as in <ref> [4] </ref>. The complexity parameter n is the distance between the starting point and the target. To assure that there is a relationship between the complexity parameter and the competitive ratio, we assume that every obstacle contains a unit circle.

Reference-contexts: To mention just a few: to find ANY competitive ratio for point to point navigation, to improve the lower bounds (currently, very weak for randomized algorithms, the best, (log log n) is provided by Karloff et al. <ref> [5] </ref>), to improve the upper bound, to generalize to three dimensions. 2 Preliminaries We assume that the robots moves on a plane, and that is always knows the coordinates of its current position. The initial position of the robots is (0,0), later we refer to this point as the source.

Reference-contexts: If the obstacles are arbitrary convex figures, no better lower bound is known, but no matching competitive ratio was obtained. If the obstacles are arbitrary rectangles, one can apply the deterministic algorithm of Lumelsky and Stepanov <ref> [6] </ref> to obtain competitive ratio O (n). For arbitrary convex obstacles, NO upper bound on deterministic competitive ratio is known. In this paper, we provide a randomized algorithm for the last problem, with a competitive ratio O (n 3=4 ).
