Abstract: 10: T = shortest path tree of Q Figure 14: BRBC algorithm of [11], which computes a bounded-radius spanning tree T for a net N , with source s 2 N and radius R, using parameter * (we use dist(L i ; L i+1 ) to denote the edge cost between two consecutive points in the depth-first tour L). T will have radius at most (1 + *) R, and cost at most (1 + 2
