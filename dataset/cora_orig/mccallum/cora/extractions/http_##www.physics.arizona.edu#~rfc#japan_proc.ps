Abstract: Many characteristics of galactic nuclei may be associated with the accretion of ambient gas by a central concentration of mass. Using a 3D hydrodynamical code, we have been simulating this accretion process for Sgr A*, the compact nonthermal source at the center of the Milky Way, in order to realistically model the gaseous flows in the inner parsec of our Galaxy. In the most recent simulations, we have taken into account the likely distribution of wind sources and we find that the structure of the flow can be significantly different from that due to a uniform medium. We here present our results concerning the mass and angular momentum accretion rates and discuss how these may be used to set constraints on our Galaxy's central engine.

Reference-contexts: From emission line observations, the Galactic Center wind has a mass flow away from the IRS 16 region of ~0.003 M fi yr 1 <ref> (Geballe et al., 1991) </ref>. In the simulations presented here, in order to facilitate comparison with earlier work, we use a Mach 10 700 km s 1 polytropic wind (fl = 4=3) with a density of 5500 cm 3 . 2.

Reference-contexts: Summary of Results The mass accretion rate, _ M , for a spatially uniform gas flowing into the volume of solution via a single face is larger than in earlier simulations due to different handling of the accretor boundary but agrees better with theory <ref> (Ruffert & Melia, 1994) </ref>. We next modeled the wind as coming from a cluster of 10 pseudo-randomly placed sources.
