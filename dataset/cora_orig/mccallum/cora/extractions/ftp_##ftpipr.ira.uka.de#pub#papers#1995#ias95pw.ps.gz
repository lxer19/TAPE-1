Abstract: The path of a mobile robot in indoor environments can be described as a sequence of low level, so called reflexive navigation tasks. Such a task is collision avoidance; a behavior which enables the robot to follow a designated path in environments with large free space areas and to avoid obstacles simultaneously. Keeping up a continuous speed is sometimes more important than always having precise position knowledge. This behavior is not adequate in every situation though. Especially for difficult navigation tasks like passing a door or entering an elevator the robot has to drive closer to obstacles than permitted by collision avoidance safety requirements. Vision systems help to overcome the problem that range sensors do not find structures to correct the robot's position if the robot operates close to obstacles or if the environment is too cluttered. Using an active vision system the robot is able to chose any visible object of which the position is known and navigate relative to it. By way of contrast to approaches that use image sequences the method described performs a correction just using one pair of stereo images. Because of that the robot does not have to slow down significantly in order to perform a position correction.

Reference-contexts: Only parametric information about the environment and commands to the robot are transmitted via radio. As three different types of communication (PVM (Oak, 1993), sockets and serial radio link) are used for PRIAMOS, it was necessary to develop a general communication protocol called RobMessages <ref> (Appenzeller, 1994) </ref>. With this protocol it is possible to exchange information from any system unit with any other without the necessity of taking care of the physical communication link. The RobMessage-System also supports the teleoperation of PRIAMOS and the camera head KASTOR.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Several approaches using mono camera systems have been presented in literature <ref> (Betke and Gurvits, 1994) </ref>. The general problem with these systems is that observations of an object from different positions need to be available. This procedure is time expensive and sensitive to errors caused by imprecise robot motions.

Reference-contexts: The accuracy of corner detection determines the quality of calibration. 3.1.2 Detection of reference points In order to improve this poor accuracy in the detection of reference points photogrammetric methods are applied for the calibration <ref> (Beyer, 1991) </ref>. An automatic calibration technique that detects the reference points in the images with sub-pixel accuracy was developed (Hetzel, 1994). In order to reach the accuracy of 0:1 pixels in the point detection a new reference object is used.

Reference-contexts: This was necessary in order to operate PRIAMOS safely and accurately in laboratory or industrial environments. The sensor equipment of PRIAMOS are odmetric sensors, 24 ultrasonic sensors and the camera head 1 PRI = Permutation of the German name of our institute, AMOS = Autonomous MObile System KASTOR. PRIAMOS <ref> (Dillmann et al., 1993) </ref> is equipped with four Mecanum wheels, which enable three degrees of freedom. This means that PRIAMOS is able to move forth and back, left and right, and turn on the point. All these degrees of freedom can be combined.

Reference-contexts: Zoom and focus as well as the vergence of each camera unit are equipped with motors. Later a third passive camera was added to the system in order to improve the reliability of the vision system <ref> (Dold and Mass, 1994) </ref>. The cameras are connected to a real-time vision system, which has been modified for stereo image-processing purposes. The image-processing system is able to produce a symbolic contour description by edges extracted from the stereo images in real-time. <p> With KASTOR being able to perform a real-time edge detection, an edge-based matching algorithm is applied. The high quality of calibration enables a highly precise computation of corresponding endpoints of edges with the use of the epipolar constraint. In <ref> (Dold and Mass, 1994) </ref> it was shown that corresponding image points can be computed unequivocally if three or more calibrated cameras are used. With a binocular stereo system that is not provided with any knowledge of the environment the matching is very difficult.

Because of tolerances in the lenses the best results are received if the positions are always adjusted from the same side.
