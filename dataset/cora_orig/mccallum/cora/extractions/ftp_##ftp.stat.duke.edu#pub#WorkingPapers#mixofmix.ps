Abstract: Discrete mixtures of normal distributions are widely used in modeling amplitude fluctuations of electrical potentials at synapses of human, and other animal nervous systems. The usual framework has independent data values y j arising as y j = j + x n 0 +j where the means j come from some discrete prior G() and the unknown x n 0 +j 's and observed x j ; j = 1; : : : ; n 0 are gaussian noise terms. A practically important development of the associated statistical methods is the issue of non-normality of the noise terms, often the norm rather than the exception in the neurological context. We have recently developed models, based on convolutions of Dirichlet process mixtures, for such problems. Explicitly, we model the noise data values x j as arising from a Dirich-let process mixture of normals, in addition to modeling the location prior G() as a Dirichlet process itself. This induces a Dirichlet mixture of mixtures of normals, whose analysis may be developed using Gibbs sampling techniques. We discuss these models and their analysis, and illustrate in the context of neurological response analysis.

Reference-contexts: It is desired to determine the number of components and the distribution of each of the components. This is so called `deconvolution'. Some techniques used in estimation of such models include least-squares <ref> (Wong and Redman, 1980) </ref>, 2 minimization (Ling and Tolhurst, 1983) and maximum likelihood and entropy techniques (Kullman, 1989; Redman, 1990). The EM-algorithm has naturally been widely used. Our work provides Bayesian approaches to the problem.
