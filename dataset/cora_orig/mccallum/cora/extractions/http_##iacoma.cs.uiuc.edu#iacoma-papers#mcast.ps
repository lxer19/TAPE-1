Abstract: This paper presents an efficient routing and flow control mechanism to implement multidestination message passing in wormhole networks.It is targeted to situations where the size of message data is very small, like in invalidation and update messages in distributed shared-memory multiprocessors (DSMs) with hardware cache coherence. The mechanism is a variation of tree-based multicast with pruning to avoid deadlocks. The new scheme does not require that the destination addresses in a given multicast message be ordered, thereby avoiding any ordering overhead. It allows messages to use any deadlock-free routing function and only requires one startup for each multicast message. The new scheme has been evaluated on several k-ary n-cube networks under synthetic loads. The results show that the proposed scheme is faster than other multicast mechanisms when the multicast traffic is composed of short messages.

Reference-contexts: New partially and fully adaptive path-based multic-ast wormhole routing algorithms called PM, FM and LD were defined for 2D-meshes [4]. However, the design of deadlock-free adaptive multicast algorithms is complex. For this reason, new methodologies for designing deadlock-free adaptive multicast algorithms were proposed in <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. Recently, the BRCP (Base Routing Conformed Path) model was developed [7]. This is a new path-based message passing mechanism that transports multicast and broadcast messages and is deadlock-free. This mechanism can use any base routing scheme such as e-cube, planar-adaptive, turn-model or fully adaptive.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The performance of scalable multiprocessors is often determined by how effectively they support processor communication. Multicast communications routinely appear in parallel programs. Typical examples include explicit distribution of data to several nodes or invalidation and update messages in distributed shared-memory multiprocessors <ref> [2] </ref> (DSMs). Similarly, many-to-one messages are also common. Examples include barrier synchronization and global reductions. It appears, therefore, that optimizing the mul-ticast operation would improve the performance of scalable multiprocessors. Efficient support for multicast has been the subject of much previous research.
