Title: Constructing Cyberspace: Virtual Reality and Hypermedia

Abstract: Large-scale, distributed hypermedia information systems allow fast, structured access to very large, dynamic information bases. The highly perceptual nature of a virtual reality interface has the power to take users both inside information and inside its structure. Combining the two takes us a step towards cyberspace, William Gibson's vision of a virtual model of all the world's interconnected data. This paper reviews current work on the boundary of virtual reality and hypermedia.

Harmony's collection (hierarchical) browser, text viewer, image viewer, and 3D viewer are visible. 3 We use the term deep hyperspace to refer to large-scale (many tens of thousands of nodes), dynamic hyperstructures.

Reference-contexts: Doors (links) set in the walls of a room can be opened (clicked) to reach another room through a kind of teleportation. In Graz, we have implemented a fully-integrated 3D scene viewer as part of the Harmony browser for the Hyper-G hypermedia information system <ref> [And92] </ref>. Scene description files are stored in the hypermedia database just like any other document. Users arriving at such a scene node (by following a link from some other node in the hypermedia web) are presented with a 3D representation of the scene.

Reference-contexts: HyperCard [Goo87] and ToolBook [Cor89]). Documents must fit into a fixed-size frame (screen) and authors have full control over both their content and presentation. 2 Hypermedia information systems, on the other hand, are typically window-based, dis-tributed, multi-user systems (e.g. Intermedia [HKRC92], Hyper-G [KMS93, KM93], and WorldWideWeb <ref> [BCGP92] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Hypermedia is the generalisation of hypertext to include all kinds of media (images, drawings, sound, film clips, 3D models, etc.) as well as text. The individual chunks of information are usually referred to as documents or nodes, and the connections between them as links. [Nie90] and <ref> [BD91] </ref> are good introductory texts on hypertext and hypermedia. One of the main problems in hypermedia systems is that of user disorientation, becoming "lost in hyperspace", first discussed by [EH89].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Cross-fertilisation between virtual reality (VR) and hypermedia has resulted in two main application domains: "hypertextualising the space" and "spatialising the hypertext", as Jay Bolter termed them in his ECHT'92 keynote address <ref> [Bol92] </ref>. The former entails the use of navigable, three-dimensional models, certain elements of which embody hypermedia links to other related information. The latter involves generating a spatial representation of the hypermedia web itself, a kind of 3D overview map.

Reference-contexts: One of the main problems in hypermedia systems is that of user disorientation, becoming "lost in hyperspace", first discussed by <ref> [EH89] </ref>. The symptoms are: the difficulty of gaining an overview, finding information again, not knowing how much information there is on a subject and how much of it has already been seen, not knowing whether everything important has been seen, etc.

Reference-contexts: Information is typically distributed over many sites. Deep hyperspace approaches William Gibson's cyberspace, a virtual model of all the world's interconnected data. 3 3D Overviews Mapping Out Cyberspace Some seminal work has been done on "spatialising the hypertext", providing three- dimensional overview maps and visualisations of (hypertextual) information. SemNet <ref> [FPF88] </ref> was an exploratory system which represented knowledge bases as directed graphs in 3D. Labeled rectangles (nodes) were connected by lines or arcs. The 3D layout has the advantage over 2D layouts that the nodes of an arbitrary graph can be positioned so that no arcs intersect.

Reference-contexts: Hierarchical information, such as part of a file system or a company hierarchy chart, is laid out as a uniform 3D cone. The tree can be rotated to bring interesting parts to the front and pruned to remove non-relevant information. VizNet <ref> [FSHH93] </ref> also uses a cone tree representation for hierarchical information, but provides an additional spherical representation for associative relationships (local map). The current node is located (say) at the north pole, nodes similar to it are strung along lines of longitude.

Reference-contexts: The 3D layout has the advantage over 2D layouts that the nodes of an arbitrary graph can be positioned so that no arcs intersect. Several techniques for positioning nodes were explored: random, multidimensional scaling, heuristics, and manual editing. Clustering techniques and fisheye views <ref> [Fur86] </ref> were also implemented. The Information Visualizer [RCM93] provides three-dimensional representations for linear and hierarchically structured information: the perspective wall [MRC91] and cone tree [RMC91] respectively. Linear information, such as chronologically ordered information, is pasted on to a virtual wall from left to right.
