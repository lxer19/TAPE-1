Abstract: In this paper some new results for multidimensional m-band bi-orthogonal filter banks are presented. In the first part of the paper we introduce the ladder structure as a method for the design and implementation of aforementioned filter banks. The second part of the paper focuses upon enforcing linear phase (LP) conditions in the context of ladder structures. The formulation of the LP conditions is done with the help of a recently introduced, al-gebraicly oriented method for describing multidimensional filter banks. It is shown that in this notation, ladder structures allow a natural formulation of LP conditions.

Multidimensional signals, sampling lattices and polyphases The notation z will denote a variable ranging over a multidimensional (M-D) complex vector space. <p> We call such matrices c-circulant, as they are circulant on the level of cosets. We remark that a product of two c-circulant matrices is again c-circulant. Conditions for FB being aliasing free and perfect reconstructing (PR) are given in <ref> [6] </ref>. For the particular of a PRFB with delay 0, we have T k;l = ffi k;l . We call a PRFB with FIR filters bi-orthogonal (BO) if and only if the determinant of the analysis (synthesis) matrix is a monomial with coefficient 1.

BASIC NOTATIONS AND FACTS A basic reference to the notations and theorems as introduced in this section is [6] and <ref> [7] </ref>. It is based upon a formulation as found in [3]. 2.1. Multidimensional signals, sampling lattices and polyphases The notation z will denote a variable ranging over a multidimensional (M-D) complex vector space. <p> Fig. 2 shows an example of a 1-D 3-band PRFB implemented by the ladder structure. PR is obvious since the synthesis ladder is just the inverse of the analysis ladder. A formal proof is given in <ref> [7] </ref>, where it is also shown that ladders implement bi-orthogonal (BO) PRFBs. In 1-D, this construction is shown to be complete [7]. The ladder of Fig. 2 is in the down-sampled domain. <p> PR is obvious since the synthesis ladder is just the inverse of the analysis ladder. A formal proof is given in <ref> [7] </ref>, where it is also shown that ladders implement bi-orthogonal (BO) PRFBs. In 1-D, this construction is shown to be complete [7]. The ladder of Fig. 2 is in the down-sampled domain. For the construction of the linear phase cascades (Section 4), it is useful to move it to the upsam-pled domain. <p> LINEAR PHASE CHARACTERIZATION AND LADDER STRUCTURES We begin with the characterization of linear phase filter banks in terms of their modified polyphase component matrices. For a complete treatment of the subject, refer to <ref> [7] </ref>. Let H be a set of filters of the analysis (or synthesis) side of an band, critically subsampled filter bank w.r.t. a lattice L. Each filter in H m 2 H will be indexed by a coset m 2 C (L). <p> Note that ~m is as defined in Sec. 2. For proof, refer to <ref> [7] </ref>. We are now ready to develop structures for designing linear phase multidimensional filter banks. The basic approach we follow is to start with a simple linear phase (and PR) filter bank which we call the seed. <p> There are two interesting questions at this stage: do matrices that obey Def. 1 exist and are they easily synthesized by a ladder cascade? The answer to both questions is yes <ref> [7] </ref> and is illustrated by the following example Example 1 (right extension of 2-D 3-band filter) Consider the lattice generated by the matrix 1 1 . <p> Note that the first and last extension matrix above can be directly by ladders and the one in the middle by a lattice-like structure. However, the middle matrix can easily be decomposed into a ladder too <ref> [7] </ref>. Fig. 5 shows a mixed-mode ladder-lattice imple mentation. A pure ladder implementation of the example, obtained by decomposing the lattice-like middle matrix into ladder steps, is shown in Fig. 4. 2 structure. <p> Let fb m l (z)g be a left extension matrix satisfying Def. 7, then the extension fe l (z)g = fb l (z)g fs l (z)g; (9) is also linear phase with group delay d. 1 see <ref> [7] </ref> for an introduction to good numbers. Similar to Cor. 1, we have that if fs m l g is good reconstruc tion and detfb m l g is a monomial, then fe m l g is also good reconstruction. In [7] it is shown that c-circulant elementary matrices, with the <p> also linear phase with group delay d. 1 see <ref> [7] </ref> for an introduction to good numbers. Similar to Cor. 1, we have that if fs m l g is good reconstruc tion and detfb m l g is a monomial, then fe m l g is also good reconstruction. In [7] it is shown that c-circulant elementary matrices, with the non-diagonal entry being linear-phase (anti-)symmetric with a group delay depending on its position in the matrix are of type l-ext. Hence l-ext matrices have the form of ladder step-matrices, and are themselves linear phase. The following example illustrates this fact.

The basic method is similar to that presented for the 1-D even-band paraunitary case in <ref> [8] </ref> and extended to the odd-band case in [10] for lattice structures. Extension of this approach to the multidimensional two-channel and 2-D hexagonal case were done in [9]. Our treatment is, however, dimension independent and we treat both the odd and the even band case together. 4.1.
