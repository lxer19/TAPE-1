Abstract: Let G be a Lie group of polynomial growth. We prove that the second-order Riesz transforms on L 2 (G ; dg) are bounded if, and only if, the group is a local direct product of a compact group and a nilpotent group, in which case the transforms of all orders are bounded.

Remark For compact groups the inequalities of Condition 1 ff are established for all ff in <ref> [BER] </ref>. Moreover, if G is nilpotent then Conditions 1 ff and 2 ff are established for all ff in [ERS].

Reference-contexts: Conversely, if Condition 4 ff is valid then the Gaussian bounds of Condition 2 ff are valid and Condition 3 ff;p follows by quadrature, as before. Finally we show that Condition 1 ff;p implies Condition 3 ff;p for all p 2 h1; 1i. It follows from <ref> [DuR] </ref>, Theorem 3.4, that the operator H has a bounded H 1 -functional calculus on L p . Hence there exists a c &gt; 0 such that kH jffj=2 S t k p!p = kH jffj=2 e tH k p!p c t jffj=2 11 uniformly for all t &gt; 0. <p> kH 1=2 'k p c P d 0 i=1 kA i 'k p for all ' 2 D (H) and then, by density, for all ' 2 L 0 p;1 . 2 Finally, since the operator H on L p has a bounded H 1 -functional calculus (see, for example, <ref> [DuR] </ref>, Theorem 3.4) the proof of Proposition 4.3 can be carried over line by line and one deduces boundedness of the fractional Riesz transforms on the L p -spaces.

Reference-contexts: It is a much deeper result that D (H n=2 ) = L 0 2;n for all n 2 N (see <ref> [ElR1] </ref>). The operator H generates a self-adjoint contraction semigroup S with a strictly positive integral kernel K. <p> The group G is always assumed to have polynomial growth. First note that D (H n=2 ) = D ((H + I) n=2 ) = L 0 2;n = jffjn D (A ff ) for all n 2 N by <ref> [ElR1] </ref>. Then for each multi-index ff consider the following conditions. 1 ff . There is a c &gt; 0 such that kA ff 'k 2 c kH jffj=2 'k 2 for all ' 2 D (H jffj=2 ). 2 ff . <p> Moreover, kA fi fl A ff S t k 2!2 c n kS t k 2!2 + kH (2n1)=2 S t k 2!2 for a suitable c n &gt; 0 by <ref> [ElR1] </ref>, Theorem 7.2.IV. Then kA fi fl A ff S t k 2!2 c 0 by another application of spectral theory. Combining these estimates gives the first bounds of the lemma. <p> Now consider the unitary representation g 7! L (g)(I P ) of G on (I P )L 2 (G ; dg). It follows from <ref> [ElR1] </ref>, Theorem 7.2.IV, that one has bounds kA ff (I P )'k 2 c jffj (kH jffj=2 (I P )'k 2 + k (I P )'k 2 ) for some c jffj &gt; 0 and all ' 2 (I P )D (H jffj=2 ).

Next we establish similar bounds on (I P )L 2 (G ; dg).

Reference-contexts: Then the Killing form on m is negative-definite since all eigenvalues of the adjoint representation on a group of polynomial growth are purely imaginary (see <ref> [Gui] </ref>). Hence M is compact and therefore closed in G by [Hoc], Theorems XIII.1.1 and XIII.1.3. In addition, G = QM and Q is closed in G (see [Var], Theorem 3.18.13). Since M is compact the moduli on G and Q do not differ much.

Reference-contexts: We establish that it is impossible to have ! = 0 for all higher derivatives unless G is the local direct product of a compact and a nilpotent.

Reference-contexts: If the group has polynomial growth then the L 1 -norm of the heat kernel decreases like V (t) 1=2 where V (t) is the volume of the ball of radius t measured with respect to a canonical distance. Moreover, Saloff-Coste <ref> [Sal] </ref> has shown that the derivatives of the heat kernel have a similar asymptotic behaviour with an additional factor t 1=2 . Higher derivatives can also be bounded with an additional factor t 1=2 for each derivative and an overall factor e !t with ! &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: We rely heavily on the structure theory of Lie groups. We begin with some geometric observations. First note that two moduli on a Lie group associated with two algebraic bases are equivalent on the complement of any neighbourhood of the identity by <ref> [VSC] </ref>, Proposition III.4.2. Secondly one has the following simple relationship. Lemma 3.1 Let Q; E be Lie groups with moduli j j Q and j j E and : Q ! E a Lie group homomorphism.
