Abstract: A critical area in electronics assembly manufacturing is the test and repair area. Computerized decision aids at this area can facilitate enhanced system performance. A key to developing computer-based aids is gaining an understanding of the human problem solving process in the complex task of troubleshooting in electronics manufacturing. In this paper, we present a computational model of troubleshooting and learning in electronics assembly manufacturing. The model is based on a theory of knowledge representation, reasoning, and learning, which is grounded in observations of human problem solving. The theory provides a foundation for developing applications of AI in complex, real world domains. 2. INTRODUCTION One of the critical areas in electronics assembly manufacturing is the test and repair area. It is estimated that about 20% of the printed-circuit boards (PCBs) fail in the test area in a typical electronics assembly line. When the PCBs spend a considerable amount of time in the test and repair area, it increases the work-in-process inventory and slows down the feedback to the manufacturing line for achieving better process control. This results in significant retardation of system performance. Computerized decision aids can potentially alleviate some of the major problems in the test and repair area and facilitate enhanced system performance. A key to developing computer-based aids is gaining an under-standing of the human problem solving process in the complex task of troubleshooting in electronic manufacturing. A computational model of an operator involved in the task of troubleshooting a faulty PCB was developed based on protocol analysis of over 300 problem solving episodes gathered in the test area at NCR's Engineering and Manufac-turing plant near Atlanta. Of the data collected, one set was used in the development of the model and the remaining set was used to perform both behavioral validation and process validation of the computational model. Analysis of the model revealed the need for a learning component in the system both for reasons of cognitive plausibility, as well as to capture the evolution of system knowledge in order to overcome the brittleness problem in dealing with the com-plexities of this domain. This paper presents a description of the problem and characterizes a knowledge-based system for this task in terms of the types of knowledge, methods, and control of processing. We present the validation results of the model for a major category of PCB failures. We then present a conceptual framework to support the learning of associative and heuristic knowledge used by human operators in the troubleshooting task. Finally, we outline our approach in developing a com-putational model of learning for this task, based on inductive and explanation-based algorithms for machine learning, and conclude with a summary of related research. This research is useful from a manufacturing systems research standpoint as it attempts to operationalize artificial in
