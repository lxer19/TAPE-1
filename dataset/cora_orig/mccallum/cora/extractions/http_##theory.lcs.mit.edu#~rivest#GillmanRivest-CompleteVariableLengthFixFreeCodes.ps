Abstract: A set of codewords is fix-free if it is both prefix-free and suffix-free: no codeword in the set is a prefix or a suffix of any other. A set of codewords fx 1 ; x 2 ; : : :; x n g over a t-letter alphabet is said to be complete if it satisfies the Kraft inequality with equality, so that X 1in The set k of all codewords of length k is obviously both fix-free and complete. We show, surprisingly, that there are other examples of complete fix-free codes, ones whose codewords have a variety of lengths. We discuss such variable-length (complete) fix-free codes and techniques for constructing them.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction While investigating the properties of Huffman codes <ref> [1] </ref>, we became interested in codes that were both prefix-free and suffix-free (or "fix-free"). Fix-free codes have a number of interesting properties.
