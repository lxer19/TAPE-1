Title: Map Interpretation in Dynamic Environments

Abstract: In this paper we present a navigation system for a mobile robot that is capable of operating in dynamic environments. Mapbuilding is based on landmark detection, with landmarks being established through a process of self-organisation of the robot's sensory data. The resultant map can then be used to determine, and subsequently follow, arbitrary paths through the environment. The results of several experiments carried out with a Nomad 200 mobile robot in a dynamic environment are presented.

Reference-contexts: The shortest path is then calculated according to the total link cost rather than total distance. All updates to confidence value are made made uni-directionally 1 . This idea is similar to the one used in <ref> [4] </ref>. However, in our scheme, the calculation of cost is dependent on the distance recorded on the link concerned. In [4], this dependence can be ignored since the distance between each node is constant (each place node is described simply by its co-ordinates as obtained from the robot's onboard odometry mechanism, <p> All updates to confidence value are made made uni-directionally 1 .

Reference-contexts: Here, distinct locations, or landmarks, are connected by vectors denoting the distance and direction between them. Figure 2 shows the form of the vector map (for discussion on using a topological mapping of this type in preference to a metric representation see <ref> [7] </ref>). Landmarks within the represent particular landmarks within the environment, the arcs connecting the nodes record the compass direction, ff, and distance, d, between these landmarks. environment are selected by the system itself through a process of self-organisation of the robot's sensory data. <p> The basis of the planning mechanism is the `best-first search' algorithm, which is used in this instance to determine the shortest known path between the current location and the goal location. In previous experiments (see <ref> [7] </ref>), the robot was sometimes unable to find a place at the location given by the map. This phenomenon can be particularly prominent at locations near to junctions or cluttered areas where even small deviations in the robot's position and/or orientation can substantially alter the robot's perception.

Reference-contexts: Such a be-haviour could form the basis of a `map-based' exploration mechanism. The environment used in these experiments is of a simple, box world, type. Although the principle of navigation based on perceptual landmarks in `real world' situations has been shown to be viable <ref> [8] </ref>, further experimentation is required with the current system in such situations.

Reference-contexts: For the experiments described in this paper, a Reduced Coulomb Energy (RCE) <ref> [9] </ref> network was used for this purpose. With this method, mapping is achieved by performing an unsupervised clustering of the robot's perceptual data as it moves through the environment. The resultant classifications can be seen as `perceptual landmarks' within the environment.
