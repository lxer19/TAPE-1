Abstract: The goal of Intelligent Computer-Aided Engineering (ICAE) is to construct computer programs which capture a significant fraction of an engineer's knowledge. Today ICAE systems are a goal, not a reality. This paper attempts to refine that goal and suggest how to get there. We begin by examining several scenarios of what ICAE systems could be like. Next we describe why ICAE won't directly evolve from current applications of expert system technology to engineering problems. We focus on qualitative physics as a critical area where progress is needed, both in terms of representations and styles of reasoning.

However, many open problems remain, including successive refinement of qualitative simulations and combining results from multiple perspectives.

Reference-contexts: The best work in this area is Weld's recent PhD thesis, which presented a domain-independent theory of comparative analysis, explored both by formal analysis and by implementation. He formalized the variety of differential analysis suggested in <ref> [28] </ref> (finding and fixing rather signficant flaws), developed an entirely new kind of comparative analysis called exaggeration, and analyzed the trade-offs between these two forms of analysis. Exaggeration works by creating extreme cases. <p> The importance of this idea has already been recognized in qualitative physics (e.g., the identification of the local evolution problem in <ref> [28] </ref> and partial-state envisionment in [77]), but little work has been done to realize it. The notion of p-component in QP theory defines an isolation criteria for domain models; if the boundaries of p-components do not change then simulation within them can proceed independently.

Reference-contexts: Even if AE's turn out to be infeasible to compute for all but the simplest systems, we suspect the framework they provide will be useful for understanding and characterizing other planning systems. Experiments with a prototype implementation have been encouraging so far <ref> [35] </ref>. 4.2.5 Scaling up Earlier we argued that domain models which fully capture the tacit knowledge of engineers will probably be orders of magnitude larger than our current models.

Reference-contexts: However, many open problems remain, including successive refinement of qualitative simulations and combining results from multiple perspectives. Hiearchy can also be exploited at the level of behaviors. For instance, Weld's work on aggregation [73] provides dynamic summarization of discrete process or continuous process models. Kuipers' time-scale abstraction technique <ref> [48] </ref> allows the effects of "slow" components of behaviors to be abstractly represented as functions, under certain assumptions. Time/Space tradeoffs: How much of an envisionment is precomputed versus constructed "on the fly" will depend on the kind of problem we wish to solve and the available hardware.
