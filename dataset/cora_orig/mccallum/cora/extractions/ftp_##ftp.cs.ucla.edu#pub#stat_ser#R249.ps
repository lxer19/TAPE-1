Title: The New Challenge: From a Century of Statistics to an Age of Causation

Abstract: Some of the main users of statistical methods - economists, social scientists, and epidemiologists are discovering that their fields rest not on statistical but on causal foundations. The blurring of these foundations over the years follows from the lack of mathematical notation capable of distinguishing causal from equational relationships. By providing formal and natural explication of such relations, graphical methods have the potential to revolutionize how statistics is used in knowledge-rich applications. Statisticians, in response, are beginning to realize that causality is not a metaphysical dead-end but a meaningful concept with clear mathematical underpinning. The paper surveys these developments and outlines future challenges.

Reference-contexts: endogenous variables is generally meaningless." According to LeRoy's recent proposal, causal relationships cannot be attributed to any variable whose causes have separate influence on the effect variable, thus denying causal reading to most of the structural parameters that economists labor to estimate and ruling out most policy variables in economics <ref> [Balke and Pearl, 1995] </ref>. Nancy Cartwright, a renowned philosopher of economics, addresses these difficulties by initiating a renewed attack on the tormenting question: "Why can we assume that we can read off causes, including causal order, from the parameters in equations whose exogenous variables are uncorrelated?" [Cartwright, 1995b].

Philip Dawid states, "Causal inference is one of the most important, most subtle, and most neglected of all the problems of statistics" <ref> [Dawid, 1979] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Y can be determined by regressing Y on X or, in other words, if the empty set of covariates Z = f0g is admissible according to the procedure above. 5 geneity, according to which X is exogenous for Y when-ever it is "independent of the random terms of the system" <ref> [Dhrymes, 1970, p. 169] </ref> is ambiguous, because (1) the random terms are not fully defined [Leamer, 1985] and (2) in the case where the equation for Y contains variables other than X, one must specify which random terms are to be considered.

Reference-contexts: When failure occurs in Step 1, it does not mean that the measurement of Z cannot be useful for estimating the effect of X on Y; nonstandard adjustments might then be used instead of the standard method of partitioning into groups homogeneous relative to Z (see <ref> [Galles and Pearl, 1995] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: truths from other causal premises 5 The teachings of current economists and philosophers who understand the role of causality in SEM, among them Leamer [1985], Woodward [1995], Cartwright [1995b], Hoover [1995], and Gold-berger [1991], are in danger of meeting a similar fate, unless their ideas are cast into mathematical symbols. <ref> [Galles and Pearl, 1996] </ref>. A concrete example will demonstrate the power and potential of the graphical language. <p> Graphs fill this linguistic gap. They provide both semantics and axiomatic characterization of manipulative statements of the form "Changing X will not affect Y if we hold Z constant," and also serve as "theorem provers" to facilitate the derivation of such sentences from other sentences <ref> [Galles and Pearl, 1996] </ref>. 4 The Challenge Recent progress in graphical methods and nonparamet-ric structural modeling has rendered causal analysis amiable to ordinary statistical techniques and accessible to rank-and-file researchers.

Reference-contexts: distinct from "Mud is independent of rain." Such a language, to the best of my knowledge, has not so far become part of standard statistical research. 2 Researchers in Search of a Lan guage Two languages for causality have in fact been proposed: path analysis or structural equation modelling (SEM) <ref> [Wright, 1921; Haavelmo, 1943] </ref>, and Neyman-Rubin's potential-response model [Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974]. <p> The explanation for this state of affairs may serve as a classic illustration of the immense importance of mathematical notation in the development of the sciences. A brief sketch of the SEM episode follows. SEM was developed by geneticists [Wright, 1921] and economists <ref> [Haavelmo, 1943] </ref> so that cause-effect information could be combined with statistical data to answer policy-related questions. <p> However, perhaps for 3 Notable exceptions are [Leamer, 1985] and [Hoover, 1995, pages 75-90]. 4 Holland's interpretation stands at variance with the structural reading of the equation above <ref> [Haavelmo, 1943] </ref>, which is "In an ideal experiment where we control X to x and any other set Z of variables (not containing X or Y ) to z, Y is independent of z and is given by a + bx + *" [Pearl, 1995a, p. 704]. 3 reasons of mathematical

Given the dearth of doctoral theses, research papers, and textbook pages on causation, Pearson apparently still rules statistics.

The founders of SEM expressed no such trepidation. Wright [1923] did not hesitate to declare that "prior knowledge of the causal relations is assumed as prerequisite" in the theory of path coefficients, and Haavelmo [1943] explicitly interpreted each structural equation as a statement about a hypothetical controlled experiment.

Reference-contexts: This statement from one leading social scientist is typical: "It would be very healthy if more researchers abandon thinking of and using terms such as cause and 1 effect" <ref> [Muthen, 1987] </ref>. How can we explain why statistics, the field that gave the world powerful ideas such as the testing of hypotheses and the design of experiment abandoned causation so easily and so early? One obvious explanation is that causation is much harder to measure than correlation.

Reference-contexts: Finally, if the objective of the study is to evaluate the "direct," rather than the "total," effect of X on Y , as is the case in the Berkeley example, then other graphical procedures are available to determine the appropriate adjustment (see <ref> [Pearl and Robins, 1995] </ref>). 9 The example above is not an isolated case for which clarity and precision are gained through the use of graphical methods. In fact, the conceptual basis for SEM achieves a new level of mathematical precision and clarity through graphs.

An equivalent procedure can be obtained from Theorem 7.1 of Spirtes et al.

Simple methods are now available for solving the following problems: 1. Deriving algebraic expressions for causal effect esti mands, both total and direct <ref> [Pearl, 1995a] </ref>. 2. Selecting measurements (covariates or confounders) to obtain unbiased estimates of treatment effects from observational studies (provided certain causal connections can be assumed nonexistent) (see Sec tion 3) 3.

Such a language, to the best of my knowledge, has not so far become part of standard statistical research. 2 Researchers in Search of a Lan guage Two languages for causality have in fact been proposed: path analysis or structural equation modelling (SEM) <ref> [Wright, 1921; Haavelmo, 1943] </ref>, and Neyman-Rubin's potential-response model [Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974]. <p> The explanation for this state of affairs may serve as a classic illustration of the immense importance of mathematical notation in the development of the sciences. A brief sketch of the SEM episode follows. SEM was developed by geneticists <ref> [Wright, 1921] </ref> and economists [Haavelmo, 1943] so that cause-effect information could be combined with statistical data to answer policy-related questions.
