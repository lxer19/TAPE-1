Reference-contexts: In cases where the frequency of interrupting background activities is so high as to negatively impact system throughput, the mutator's forward progress is automatically slowed appropriately by requiring longer delays on allocation requests, as controlled by the ScanBalance state variable described in reference <ref> [1] </ref>. Detailed accountings of each of the services provided by the arbiter to the garbage-collecting microprocessor follow. -23 tendMem (for internal use) tendMem tends the descriptor held in the memory location named by its physicalAddr argument.
