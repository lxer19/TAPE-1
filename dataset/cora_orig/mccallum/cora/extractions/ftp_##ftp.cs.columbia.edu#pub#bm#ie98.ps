Title: computer generated information to enhance the users perception of the world, provide a solid foundation
Keyword: augmented reality  
Note: techniques, that use  that are worn or carried by  
Abstract: We believe that basis. Augmented reality is useful for both explicit and direct interaction for providing foreground information as well as for implicit and passive interaction for providing background interaction. We believe that both auditory and visual augmented reality play an important role, and that the combination will yield far more compelling interfaces than either could alone.
