Abstract: Given three landmarks whose location in Cartesian space is known, and a robot with the ability to detect each landmarks heading with respect to the robots internal orientation, the task is to determine the robots location and orientation in Cartesian space. Although methods are mentioned in literature, none are completely detailed to the point where useful algorithms to compute the solution are given. This paper presents four methods: 1) Iterative search, 2) Geometric circle intersection, 3) Geometric triangulation, and 4) Newton-Raphson iterative method. All four methods are presented in detail and compared in terms of robustness and computation time. For example, circle intersection fails when all three landmarks lie on a circle, while the Newton-Raphson method fails when the initial guess of the robots position and orientation is beyond a certain bound. The shortcomings and strengths of each method are discussed. A sensitivity analysis is performed on each method, with noise added to the landmark locations. The authors were involved in a mobile robotics project that demanded a robust three landmark triangulation algorithm. None of the above methods alone was adequate, but an intelligent combination of each method served to overcome their individual weaknesses. The implementation of this overall absolute positioning system is detailed.

Reference-contexts: The geometric relationship between the landmarks and the robot must be considered. Care must be taken to insure that the unique solution is computed. Although there are several references outlining triangulation, none are comprehensive nor sufficiently detailed for practical use. Kuipers and Levitt <ref> [1] </ref> note that if a robot observes two landmarks separated by an angle, then it must be on a circle determined by that angle and the distance between the landmarks. This idea is explored in detail later in this paper. <p> offset due to the robots error is the same for all landmarks 3.1 Iterative Search Triangulating from two landmarks yields and incorrect solution if the robot's orientation is incorrect because given two landmarks and the angle between them, the robot may lie anywhere on the circle defined by those parameters <ref> [1] </ref>. Conversely, if the robots orientation is correct, then triangulating from two landmarks is sufficient to produce an accurate solution. Taking this idea further, one could guess the error in the robots orientation.

Reference-contexts: These authors term triangulation from three or more landmarks viewframe localization, which is the intersection of the multiple circles formed from each pair of landmarks and angle between them. Unfortunately, there is no discussion of computing this intersection. Levitt et al. <ref> [2] </ref> is similar to the previous paper except that their solution uses two landmarks and their distances from the robot. They note that ordering the landmarks properly will yield a unique solution. Sugihara [3] discusses point location using distinguishable marks. Here more details are given to solve this problem.

Reference-contexts: If the robot is guaranteed to lie within the landmark triangle, then this method is computationally well suited for use. 3.3 Newton-Raphson Iterative Method Suggested by Dr. Yuval Roth, a recent Ph.D. graduate at the University of Michigan, the Newton-Raphson method <ref> [5] </ref> makes use of prior knowledge to solve the triangulation problem. The triangulation problem is inherently hard to solve because the equations defining the problem are nonlinear. However, a solution exists because the robot exists in the real world. <p> These are the corrections to X that move each of these functions closer to the solution simultaneously. There are solved by setting f i (X+X) to zero, yielding: f i * x 1 + x 2 f i * x 2 = - f i (X) (8) LU decomposition <ref> [5] </ref> is used to solve this matrix equation, and the corrections are added to the solution vector by: x i old + x i ; i = 1,2,3 (9) To use this method, supply the maximum number of iterations to perform along with an estimate of the correct robot position.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION A common problem in mobile robotics deals with answering the question: Where am I? This is a complicated problem in the real world. Sensors are not perfect. An environmental model is never fully complete. A robots wheels can slip, causing errors in odometry readings <ref> [6] </ref>. These limitations can be overcome by referencing the robots location to landmarks whose locations are known. Unfortunately, there are two issues that complicate the solution.

Reference-contexts: Triangulation from landmarks was also tested on a real robot. This is the robot CARMEL which was entered by the University of Michigan in the First American Association for Artificial Intelligence Robot Exhibition and Competition. Details of the competition may be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. Early in the project, it was believed that the robot would require frequent updates of its position. The method of circle intersection was chosen as the core of the absolute positioning system because of its speed, accuracy, and detection of failures.
