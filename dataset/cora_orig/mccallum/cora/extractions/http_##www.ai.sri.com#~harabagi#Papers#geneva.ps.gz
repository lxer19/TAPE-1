Abstract: This paper presents a possible solution for the text inference problem - extracting information unstated in a text, but implied. The inference algorithm consists of a set of highly parallel search methods that when applied to the knowledge base find contexts of sentences that reveal information relevant to the text. Implementation, results and parallelism analysis are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Marker propagation methods for language processing have been proposed before [Quillian 1966], [Fahlam 1979], <ref> [Charniak 1986] </ref>, [Hendler 1988] [Norvig 1989]. However, we are not aware of any other large scale implementation of marker propagations. Moreover, in our system, markers are complex data structures, and are programmable.

Reference-contexts: connections that are established when the chain of glosses has a predefined depth. * (c) The argument link list is not used in gloss connection. 3.1 Intra-sentential connections In an extensive knowledge base like ours, it is typical to have a very large number of possible connections between two concepts <ref> [Harabagiu and Moldovan 1996] </ref>. However, only some of these connections are relevant for a text, while other connections may be relevant for another text.
