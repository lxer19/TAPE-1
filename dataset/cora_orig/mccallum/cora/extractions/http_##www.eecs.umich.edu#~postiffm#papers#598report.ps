Abstract: Single Instruction stream, Multiple Data stream (SIMD) architectures have been a common paradigm for parallel processing for many years. Workstation-and PC-class microprocessors are beginning to use limited SIMD techniques for processing tasks that require large data bandwidths, yet relatively simple arithmetic operations. Such tasks include image and audio processing, video conferencing, speech recognition, and many others. In order to fill the computation demands of these applications, ISAs have been extended to handle multiple pieces of small data (each datum being less than 32 bits) simultaneously. A survey of these extensions to current ISAs is presented along with an analysis of the implementation cost of such instructions.

Intel expects speedups of 50 to 100% on some applications. PC Magazine reports improvements around 20% on the Pentium P55C in a Hewlett Packard system [13].

The MMX PMADD instruction greatly improves the performance of such operations. The PMADD handles four multiplies and two additions simultaneously.

According to [2], by using the MMX instructions, one third on the instructions (compared to code without MMX instructions) are needed to perform 8 8-bit vector dot products. Another example which makes use of SIMD type instructions is image blending, where one picture is slowly blended into another.

Reference-contexts: But none of the instruction sets that we reviewed contained an absolute value instruction. Alternatively, the algorithm could be changed to compute the squared difference and thus could make use of the parallel multiply-add instruction. Another interesting area of research, one that has been partly addressed in <ref> [6] </ref>, is to determine how to target a compiler to compile the special SIMD instructions from a high-level language. As we stated earlier, the MIPS MDMX instruction set specification states that compiler support is not planned, but that the instructions are available in assembly language and shared libraries.

Reference-contexts: The Basic Idea As early as the late 1980s, the idea of using long-word datapaths to operate on multiple subwords at once has been applied to graphics processing directly in the microprocessor core <ref> [9] </ref>. The Intel i860 processor implements three pixel data types which it manipulates in the graphics unit. There are several characteristics of the architecture that are worth noting. First, the graphics unit sources operands from the oating point register file. Each register is 64 bits wide.

Like the i860 architecture, MMX relies on the x86's oating point registers for data storage, though only the 64 least significant bits of the 80-bit registers are used for MMX data storage.
