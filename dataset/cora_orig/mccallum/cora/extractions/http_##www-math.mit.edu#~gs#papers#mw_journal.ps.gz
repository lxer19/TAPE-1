Abstract: Multiwavelets are a new addition to the body of wavelet theory. Realizable as matrix-valued filter banks leading to wavelet bases, multiwavelets offer simultaneous orthogonality, symmetry, and short support, which is not possible with scalar 2-channel wavelet systems. After reviewing this recently developed theory, we examine the use of multiwavelets in a filter bank setting for discrete-time signal and image processing. Multiwavelets differ from scalar wavelet systems in requiring two or more input streams to the multiwavelet filter bank. We describe two methods (repeated row and approximation/deapproximation) for obtaining such a vector input stream from a one-dimensional signal. Algorithms for symmetric extension of signals at boundaries are then developed, and naturally integrated with approximation-based preprocessing. We describe an additional algorithm for multiwavelet processing of two-dimensional signals, two rows at a time, and develop a new family of multiwavelets (the constrained pairs) that is well-suited to this approach. This suite of novel techniques is then applied to two basic signal processing problems, denoising via wavelet-shrinkage, and data compression. After developing the approach via model problems in one dimension, we applied multiwavelet processing to images, frequently obtaining performance superior to the comparable scalar wavelet transform.

Reference-contexts: As in the scalar case, one can find the conditions of orthogonality and approximation for multiwavelets [26, 27, 14, 20]; this is discussed below. A very important multiwavelet system was constructed by J. Geronimo, D. Hardin, and P. Massopust [12] (see <ref> [1] </ref> for another early multiwavelet construction). Their system contains the two scaling functions 3 1 (t); 2 (t) shown in Figure 1 and the two wavelets w 1 (t); w 2 (t) shown in Figure 2. <p> (t) # C [0] = 4 5 5 10 2 3 3 2 3 9 3 C [2] = 4 9 p 10 5 ; C [3] = 4 1 p 3 W (t) = w 1 (t) # D [0] = 10 4 1 3 2 5 ; D <ref> [1] </ref> = 10 4 9 0 5 ; 1 2 9 p 2 3 p 3 1 2 1 p 1 0 5 : (4) There are four remarkable properties of the Geronimo-Hardin-Massopust scaling functions: * They each have short support (the intervals [0; 1] and [0; 2]). * Both scaling <p> 4 1 3 2 5 ; D [1] = 10 4 9 0 5 ; 1 2 9 p 2 3 p 3 1 2 1 p 1 0 5 : (4) There are four remarkable properties of the Geronimo-Hardin-Massopust scaling functions: * They each have short support (the intervals <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and [0; 2]). * Both scaling functions are symmetric, and the wavelets form a symmetric/antisymmetric pair. * All integer translates of the scaling functions are orthogonal. * The system has second order of approximation (locally constant and locally linear functions are in V 0 ). <p> Moreover, a solution of a scalar dilation equation with four coefficients is supported on the interval [0; 3]!

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wavelets are a useful tool for signal processing applications such as image compression and denoising. Until recently, only scalar wavelets were known: wavelets generated by one scaling function. But one can imagine a situation when there is more than one scaling function <ref> [12] </ref>. This leads to the notion of multiwavelets, which have several advantages in comparison to scalar wavelets [26]. Such features as short support, orthogonality, symmetry, and vanishing moments are known to be important in signal processing. A scalar wavelet cannot possess all these properties at the same time [25]. <p> As in the scalar case, one can find the conditions of orthogonality and approximation for multiwavelets [26, 27, 14, 20]; this is discussed below. A very important multiwavelet system was constructed by J. Geronimo, D. Hardin, and P. Massopust <ref> [12] </ref> (see [1] for another early multiwavelet construction). Their system contains the two scaling functions 3 1 (t); 2 (t) shown in Figure 1 and the two wavelets w 1 (t); w 2 (t) shown in Figure 2. <p> A multiwavelet filter bank [26] has "taps" that are N fi N matrices (in this paper, we will be working with N = 2). Our principal example is the 4-coefficient symmetric multiwavelet filter bank whose lowpass filter was reported in <ref> [12] </ref>. This filter is given by the four 2 fi 2 matrices C [k] of equation (3).

Reference-contexts: There are infinitely many constrained orthogonal solutions of (19). Plots of two of them are shown in Figures 8 and 9. 15 The implementation of constrained multiwavelets for the two-dimensional wavelet transform is straightforward.

Since a wavelet basis consists of functions with short support (for high frequencies) and long support (for low frequencies), large smooth areas of an image may be represented with very few bits, and detail added where it is needed. <p> We made the assumption that the histograms of subband (or wavelet transform subblock) coefficient values obeyed a Laplacian distribution <ref> [18] </ref>, and designed a uniform scalar quantizer. The quantizer optimized the bit allocation among the different subbands by using an operational rate-distortion approach (minimizing the functional D + R) [23].

Reference-contexts: Heuristically, wavelet shrinkage has the advantage of not adding "bumps" or false oscillations in the process of removing noise, because of the local and smoothness-preserving nature of the wavelet transform. Wavelet shrinkage has been successfully applied to SAR imagery as a method for clutter removal <ref> [19] </ref>. It is natural to attempt to use multiwavelets as the transform for a wavelet shrinkage approach to denoising, and compare the results with scalar wavelet shrinkage. We implemented Donoho's wavelet shrinkage algorithm using several additional remarks from [19]. <p> been successfully applied to SAR imagery as a method for clutter removal <ref> [19] </ref>.

We implemented Donoho's wavelet shrinkage algorithm using several additional remarks from [19]. We compared the performance of the D 4 scalar wavelet transform with oversampled and critically sampled multiwavelet schemes. In the oversampled scheme, the first row is multiplied by p 2, to better match the first eigenvector of the GHM system.

Reference-contexts: This method introduces discontinuities at 9 the boundaries; however, it can be used with almost any filter bank. The second approach is symmetric extension of the data. Symmetric extension preserves signal continuity, but can be implemented only with linear-phase (symmetric and/or antisymmetric) filter banks <ref> [24, 3, 16, 4] </ref>. We now develop symmetric extension for linear-phase multiwavelet filters, such as the Geronimo-Hardin-Massopust multifilters. This proves useful for image compression applications (Section 6).

Reference-contexts: This leads to the notion of multiwavelets, which have several advantages in comparison to scalar wavelets [26]. Such features as short support, orthogonality, symmetry, and vanishing moments are known to be important in signal processing. A scalar wavelet cannot possess all these properties at the same time <ref> [25] </ref>. On the other hand, a multiwavelet system can simultaneously provide perfect reconstruction while preserving length (orthogonality), good performance at the boundaries (via linear-phase symmetry), and a high order of approximation (vanishing moments). Thus multiwavelets offer the possibility of superior performance for image processing applications, compared with scalar wavelets.

Reference-contexts: Until recently, only scalar wavelets were known: wavelets generated by one scaling function. But one can imagine a situation when there is more than one scaling function [12]. This leads to the notion of multiwavelets, which have several advantages in comparison to scalar wavelets <ref> [26] </ref>.

A multiwavelet filter bank <ref> [26] </ref> has "taps" that are N fi N matrices (in this paper, we will be working with N = 2). Our principal example is the 4-coefficient symmetric multiwavelet filter bank whose lowpass filter was reported in [12]. <p> Unlike a scalar 2-band paraunitary filter bank, the corresponding highpass filter (specified by the four 2 fi 2 matrices D [k] of equation (4)) cannot be obtained simply as an "alternating flip" of the lowpass filter; the wavelet filters D [k] must be designed <ref> [26] </ref>. The resulting 2-channel, 2 fi 2 matrix filter bank operates on two input data streams, filtering them into four output streams, each of which is downsampled by a factor of 2. This is shown in Figure 4.
