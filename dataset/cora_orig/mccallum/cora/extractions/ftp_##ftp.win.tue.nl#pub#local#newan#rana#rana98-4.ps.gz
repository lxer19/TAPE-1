Abstract: We present a finite volume scheme for solving elliptic boundary value problems with solutions that have one or a few small regions with high activity. The scheme results from combining the local defect correction method (LDC), introduced in [13], with standard finite volume discretizations on a global coarse and on local fine uniform grids. The iterative discretization method that is obtained in this way yields a discrete approximation of the continuous solution on a composite grid. For the LDC method in its standard form, the discrete conservation property, which is one of the main attractive features of a finite volume method, is lost for the composite grid approximation. For the modified LDC method we present here, discrete conservation holds for the composite grid solution too. Ein Finite-Volume Schema zur L osung elliptischer Randwertprobleme auf `composite grids'. Wir betrachten die lokale Defektkorrekturmethode (LDC) wie sie in [13] eingefuhrt worden ist. Wir kombinieren diese Methode mit einer standard Finite-Volumen Diskretisierung auf dem glo-balen Grobgitter und den lokalen regelmaigen Feingittern. Dies ergibt eine iterative Diskreti-sierungsmethode zur Losung von Erhaltungsgleichungen vom elliptischen Typus. Mit dieser Me-thode erhalt man eine diskrete Approximation der kontinuierlichen Losung auf einem `composite grid'. Bei der LDC-Methode in ihrer ursprunglichen Form geht die Erhaltung der Erhaltungs-groen, die eine der wesentlichen Eigenschaften des Finite-Volumen Schemas darstellt, bei der Approximation auf den `composite grids' verloren. Das Hauptanliegen dieser Arbeit ist eine modi-fizierte LDC-Methode, bei der Erhaltungsgroen auch in der diskreten Losung auf den `composite grids' erhalten werden.

Reference-contexts: This refinement strategy is known as local uniform grid refinement. The solution is approximated on the composite grid, which is the union of the uniform subgrids. Note that such composite grids are highly structured and hence very simple data structures can be used. In <ref> [13] </ref>, Hackbusch introduced the local defect correction method (LDC) for approximating the continuous solution of elliptic boundary value problems on a composite grid. In this method, which is an iterative process, a basic global discretization is improved by local discretizations defined in the subdomains. <p> In this paper, we consider the integral formulation of a stationary conservation law of elliptic type, and combine the LDC technique with standard finite volume discretizations of this law on the global coarse and local fine grids. In the LDC method as in <ref> [7-9, 13] </ref>, the discrete conservation property, which is one of the main attractive features of a finite volume method, does not hold for the composite grid approximation. <p> In practice, however, for efficiency reasons one applies only one or two LDC iterations. In numerical experiments we observe that, due to the very high convergence rate of the LDC iteration (cf. <ref> [7-9, 13] </ref>), the result after one or two LDC iterations is in general still satisfactory (with respect to conservation). <p> In Section 3.1, we explain how composite grids are formed by combining two 5 or more uniform grids with different meshsizes. In Section 3.2, we adapt the general Local Defect Correction (LDC) method from <ref> [13] </ref> to a finite volume setting. The key point here is that the definition of a suitable defect correction is based on discretization error estimates for the numerical fluxes. The LDC method is an iterative method, hence we obtain an iterative finite volume discretization method. <p> In Section 4, an example of an interface problem is given, where it is a priori clear that in a (small) part of the domain a much higher resolution is required than in the remaining part.

If in this experiment, we use the standard correction term as in <ref> [13] </ref> instead of the new correction term S H .' H;h i1 / as in (26), we obtain similar results. This is not surprising, since the conservation property is crucial across the physical interface @U " , but of minor importance across the artificial interface 0. <p> is of major importance, but using the new correction term, which yields conservation across 0, is of minor importance. 4.2 A one-dimensional time dependent convection-diffusion problem To illustrate the advantage of the finite volume adapted LDC algorithm over the algorithm with the standard choice for the correction term as in <ref> [8, 9, 13] </ref>, we consider a time dependent convection-diffusion problem, which is a simple model for the behavior of water held inside a basin by two levies.
