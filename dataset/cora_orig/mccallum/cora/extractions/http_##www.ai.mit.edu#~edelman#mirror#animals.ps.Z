Title: Class similarity and viewpoint invariance in the recognition of 3D objects

Abstract: In human vision, the processes and the representations involved in identifying specific individuals are frequently assumed to be different from those used for basic-level classification, because classification is largely viewpoint-invariant, but identification is not. This assumption was tested in psychophysical experiments, in which objective similarity between stimuli (and, consequently, the level of their distinction) varied in a controlled fashion. Subjects were trained to discriminate between two classes of computer generated 3D objects, one resembling monkeys, and the other dogs. Both classes were defined by the same set of 56 parameters, which encoded sizes, shapes, and placement of the limbs, the ears, the snout, etc. Interpolation between parameter vectors of the class prototypes yielded shapes that changed smoothly between monkey and dog. Within-class variation was induced in each trial by randomly perturbing all the parameters. After the subjects reached 90% correct performance on a fixed canonical view of each object, discrimination performance was tested for novel views that differed by up to 60 ffi from the training view. In experiment 1 (in which the distribution of parameters in each class was unimodal) and in experiment 2 (bimodal classes), the stimuli differed only parametrically and consisted of the same geons (parts), yet were recognized virtually independently of viewpoint in the low-similarity condition. In experiment 3, the prototypes differed in their complement of geons, yet the subjects' performance depended significantly on viewpoint in the high-similarity condition. In all three experiments, higher inter-stimulus similarity was associated with an increase in the mean error rate and, for misorientation of up to 45 ffi , with an increase in the degree of viewpoint dependence. These results suggest that a geon-level difference between stimuli is neither strictly necessary nor sufficient for viewpoint-invariant performance. Thus, the standard characterization of basic and subordinate-level processes in visual recognition may need a revision.

Reference-contexts: Theories of recog nition have proposed different approaches to the representation problem. A prominent recent example is structural description in terms of geons (generalized cylinders representing object parts) in the RBC, or recognition by components, scheme <ref> (Biederman, 1987) </ref>. An alternative 1 approach (Ullman and Basri, 1991; Poggio and Edelman, 1990) calls for representing objects by small collections of 2D images. It has been shown how recognition can be performed using such representations, e.g., by a process of interpolation between the stored 2D images. <p> On the other hand, psychophysical findings on basic-level recognition seem to point towards the representation of object prototypes in a more symbolic manner, for example by collections of volumetric primitives or components <ref> (Biederman, 1987) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: At the same time, when the pose is fixed, projected corners, edges, or other localized features offer better discrimination among similar shapes than shading <ref> (cf. Bulthoff and Mallot, 1988) </ref>. In human subjects, difficulty in recognizing novel views is a central characteristic of performance in tasks that require discrimination among members of the same basic category (Bulthoff and Edelman, 1992; Edelman and Bulthoff, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Does the visual system rely on distinct sets of representations and processes for subordinate and basic levels of recognition? A recent proposal <ref> (Edelman, 1991) </ref> outlined a possible unified approach to recognition at both levels, based on the notion of "features of recognition." The central tenet of the proposed account is that recognition normally requires neither 3D reconstruction of the stimulus, nor the maintenance of a library of 3D models of objects. <p> The highlights of the approach that was proposed in <ref> (Edelman, 1991) </ref> were as follows: 1. Versatility: Recognition starts with the extraction of a large variety of image-based fea tures. 2. Plasticity: Recognition procedure for a given object at a given category level is synthesized at need and is optimized with practice. 3.

Reference-contexts: Bimodal distributions are initially treated as if they were unimodal, leading to impaired performance on the exemplars that are deemed to be "outliers." It may take many hundreds of trials for the tacit assumption of unimodality to be dropped <ref> (Flannagan et al., 1986) </ref>. 5 2.4 Experiment 3 The results of experiments 1 and 2 indicate that it is not necessary for two objects to differ in their part (geon) structure to obtain performance that varies little with viewpoint.

Reference-contexts: The subjects' performance was measured by the combined percentage of correct positive responses to the two objects. This measure of performance is non-parametric, and is not affected by the subject's bias towards either of the two possible responses <ref> (Green and Swets, 1966, p.404) </ref>. 2.2 Experiment 1 In the first experiment, the parameter distribution corresponding to each of the two object classes was unimodal (each parameter had an independent Gaussian distribution, with a standard deviation of 0:075 times the mean value of that parameter.).

Reference-contexts: It remains to be seen whether endowing the two-stage model with nonaccidental feature detectors will enable it to perform above chance at large misorientations, without resorting to an elaborate multistage approach such as Hummel's recent implementation of the Recognition By Components theory <ref> (Hummel and Biederman, 1992) </ref>. 4 The value of was computed as follows. First, the mean separation S of the vectors in the entire ensemble of inputs was computed (this is the value of recommended by (Saha and Keeler, 1990)).

Reference-contexts: In human vision, the representations used for identifying specific instances of object classes (the so-called "subordinate level") are frequently postulated to be different from those used for basic-level classification <ref> (Jolicoeur, 1990) </ref>. On one hand, the recently demonstrated viewpoint dependency of subordinate-level recognition (Rock and DiVita, 1987; Tarr and Pinker, 1989; Edelman and Bulthoff, 1992; Bulthoff and Edelman, 1992) is consistent with theories that hold that the visual system represents three-dimensional objects by storing several of their two-dimensional views.

The classifier was first trained on ten images of each of the two stimuli objects (these images were taken from the same range of viewpoints that was used in the training of human subjects).

Reference-contexts: The two types of features will, in general, lead to different performance. When the pose of the object relative to the viewer changes, the projected locations of the corners will shift. Unless this shift is compensated for (e.g., by pose recovery and model alignment <ref> (Ullman, 1989) </ref>), recognition of unfamiliar views of the object will be poor. In comparison, the shape of a shaded patch can in principle be extracted regardless of the pose of the object to which it belongs (as long as the patch is visible).

Reference-contexts: Biederman and Gerhardstein, 1993). If the random objects are evolved via a controlled perturbation from real 3D objects, this approach can also help clarify the role of prior everyday exposure in the recognition process, possibly through the demonstration of an object superiority effect <ref> (Weisstein and Harris, 1974) </ref> for real objects. 4.6 Summary The psychophysical results reported in this paper suggest that viewpoint invariance, characteristic of basic-level classification, and viewpoint dependence, a trait of subordinate-level recognition, may be more closely related than previously thought.
