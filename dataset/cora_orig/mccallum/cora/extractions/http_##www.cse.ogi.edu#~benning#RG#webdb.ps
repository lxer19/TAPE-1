Reference-contexts: Models for semistructured data have been based on labeled directed graphs <ref> [Abi97, Bun97] </ref>. 1 In a semistructured data model, there is no restriction on the set of arcs that emanate from a given node in a graph, or on the types of the values of 1 It should be noted that there is no inherent difficulty in translating these models into relational

Reference-contexts: Many of the problems encountered in building these systems are similar to those addressed in building heterogeneous database systems <ref> [ACPS96, WAC + 93, HZ96, TRV98, FRV96, Bla96, HKWY97] </ref>. Web data integration systems have, in addition, to deal with (1) large and evolving number of web sources, (2) little meta-data about the characteristics of the source, and (3) larger degree of source autonomy. <p> In order to do so, the system requires a set of source descriptions. Several recent research works addressed the problem of how to specify source descriptions and how to use them for query reformulation. Broadly speaking, two general approaches have been proposed: Global as view (GAV) <ref> [GMPQ + 97, PAGM96, ACPS96, HKWY97, FRV96, TRV98] </ref> and Local as view (LAV) [LRO96, KW96, DG97a, DG97b, FW97] (see [Ull97] for a detailed comparison).

Reference-contexts: Most importantly, since a negative answer from a complete source is meaningful, the data integration system can prune access to other sources. The problem of describing completeness of web sources and using this information for query processing is addressed in <ref> [Mot89, EGW94, Lev96, Dus97, AD98, FW97] </ref>. The work described in [FKL97] describes a probabilistic formalism for describing the contents and overlaps among information sources, and presents algorithms for choosing optimally between sources.

Reference-contexts: In particular, when accessing web sources we may experience initial delays before data is transmitted, and even when it is, the arrival of the data may be bursty. The work described in <ref> [AFT98, UFA98] </ref> has considered the problem of adapting a query execution plans to initial delays in the arrival of the data.

The algorithm described in <ref> [AK97] </ref> exploits heuristics specific to the common uses of HTML in order to obtain faster learning. It should be noted that Machine Learning methods have also been used to learn the mapping between the source schemas and the mediated schemas [PE95, DEW97].

Since the data on the web is commonly semistructured (or worse), these languages still emphasize the ability to support semistructured features. We briefly describe three languages in this class: WebOQL <ref> [AM98] </ref>, StruQL [FFLS97] and Florid [HLLS97]. WebOQL The main data structure provided by WebOQL is the hy-pertree. Hypertrees are ordered arc-labeled trees with two types of arcs, internal and external. Internal arcs are used to represent structured objects and external arcs are used to represent references (typically hyperlinks) among objects.

Reference-contexts: These languages, which include W3QL [KS95], Web-SQL <ref> [MMM97, AMM97a] </ref>, and WebLog [LSS96], combine conditions on text patterns appearing within documents with graph patterns describing link structure. We use WebSQL as an example of the kinds of queries that can be asked.

Reference-contexts: An example of a data model that incorporates explicit web-specific constructs (pages and page schemes), nesting, and collection types is ADM, the data model of the Ara-neus project <ref> [AMM97b] </ref>. We remark that all the models we mention in this paper represent only static structures. For example, the work on modeling the structure of web sites do not consider dynamic web pages created as a result of user inputs. <p> Yes No W3QS [KS95] labeled multigraphs SQL Yes No WebLog [LSS96] relational Datalog No No Lorel [AQM + 97] labeled graphs OQL Yes No WebOQL [AM98] hypertrees OQL Yes Yes UnQL [BDHS96] labeled graphs structural recursion Yes Yes Strudel [FFK + 98, FFLS97] labeled graphs Datalog Yes Yes Araneus (Ulixes) <ref> [AMM97b] </ref> page schemes SQL Yes Yes Florid [HLLS97] F-logic Datalog Yes No Table 1: Comparison of query systems Content search ignores the structure of a hy-permedia network. <p> Florid provides a powerful formalism for manipulating semi-structured data in a web context. However, it does not currently support the construction of new webs as results of computation; the result is always a set of F-logic objects in the local store. Ulixes and Penelope In the Araneus project <ref> [AMM97b] </ref>, the query and restructuring process is split into two phases. In the first phase,the Ulixes language is used to build relational views over the web. These views can then be analyzed and integrated using standard database techniques. <p> It uses a single query language, StruQL, throughout the system, both for integrating the raw data and for defining the structure of the web site. Araneus <ref> [AMM97b] </ref> uses a more structured data model, ADM, and provides a language for transforming data into ADM and a language for creating web sites from data modeled in ADM. In addition, Araneus uses web-specific constructs in the data model.

Reference-contexts: In that view, a web site has many similarities to non-web information systems. Designing such a web site requires extending information systems design methodologies <ref> [AMM98, PF98] </ref>. Using these principles to build web sites will also impact the way we query the web and the way we integrate data from multiple web sources. Several trends will have significant impact on the use of database technology for web applications. The first is, of course, XML.

Reference-contexts: In addition to developing models and query languages for semistructured data, there has been considerable recent work on issues concerning the management of semistructured data, such as the extraction of structure from semistructured data [NAM98], view maintenance <ref> [ZGM98, AMR + 98] </ref>, summarization of semistructured data ([BDFS97, GW97]), and reasoning about semistructured data [CGL98, FFLS98].

Reference-contexts: Hypertrees are ordered arc-labeled trees with two types of arcs, internal and external. Internal arcs are used to represent structured objects and external arcs are used to represent references (typically hyperlinks) among objects. Arcs are labeled with records. Figure 1, from <ref> [Aro97] </ref>, shows a hypertree containing descriptions of publications from several research groups. Such a tree could easily be built, for example, from an HTML file, using a generic HTML wrapper. Sets of related hypertrees are collected into webs.

Reference-contexts: This leads naturally to questions of query computability in this context. Abiteboul and Vianu <ref> [AV97a] </ref> and Mendelzon and Milo [MM97] propose formal ways of categorizing web queries according to whether they can in principle be computed or not; the key idea being that essentially, the only possible way to access the web is to navigate links from known starting points.

Mihaila, Milo and Mendel-zon [MMM97] show how to analyze WebSQL queries in terms of the maximum number of web sites.

Finally, the field of web/db is a very dynamic one; hence, there are undoubtedly some omissions in our coverage, for which we apologize in advance. The survey is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: These are based on searching indices of words and phrases appearing in documents discovered by web "crawlers." More recently, there have been efforts to overcome the limitations of this paradigm by exploiting link structure in queries. For example, [Kle98], <ref> [BH98] </ref> and [CDRR98], propose to use the web structure to analyze the many sites returned by a search engine as relevant to a topic in order to extract those that are likely to be authoritative sources on the topic.

Reference-contexts: Before we begin, we note that there are several topics concerning the application of database concepts to the WWW which are not covered in this survey, such as caching and replication (see [WWW98, GRC97] for recent works), transaction processing and security in web environments (see e.g. <ref> [Bil98] </ref>), performance, availability and scalability issues for web servers (e.g. [CS98]), or indexing techniques and crawler technology (e.g. [CGMP98]).

Aside from the relevance of these works to the tasks mentioned in this survey, the systems based on these methods will be of special importance for the task of managing large volumes of XML data [XML98].

We briefly describe three languages in this class: WebOQL [AM98], StruQL <ref> [FFLS97] </ref> and Florid [HLLS97]. WebOQL The main data structure provided by WebOQL is the hy-pertree. Hypertrees are ordered arc-labeled trees with two types of arcs, internal and external. Internal arcs are used to represent structured objects and external arcs are used to represent references (typically hyperlinks) among objects.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the form of the HTML pages changes frequently, making it hard to maintain the wrappers. Several works have considered the problem of building tools for rapid creation of wrappers. One class of tools (e.g., <ref> [HGMN + 98, GRVB98] </ref>) is based on developing specialized grammars for specifying how the data is laid out in an HTML page, and therefore how to extract the required data. A second class of techniques is based on developing inductive learning techniques for automatically learning a wrapper.

Reference-contexts: Many of the problems encountered in building these systems are similar to those addressed in building heterogeneous database systems <ref> [ACPS96, WAC + 93, HZ96, TRV98, FRV96, Bla96, HKWY97] </ref>. Web data integration systems have, in addition, to deal with (1) large and evolving number of web sources, (2) little meta-data about the characteristics of the source, and (3) larger degree of source autonomy. <p> In order to do so, the system requires a set of source descriptions. Several recent research works addressed the problem of how to specify source descriptions and how to use them for query reformulation. Broadly speaking, two general approaches have been proposed: Global as view (GAV) <ref> [GMPQ + 97, PAGM96, ACPS96, HKWY97, FRV96, TRV98] </ref> and Local as view (LAV) [LRO96, KW96, DG97a, DG97b, FW97] (see [Ull97] for a detailed comparison). <p> The problem of describing the computing capabilities of data sources and exploiting them to create query execution plans is considered in <ref> [PGGMU95, TRV98, LRU96, HKWY97, VP97a] </ref> Query optimization: Many works on web data integration systems have focused on the problem of selecting a minimal set of web sources to access, and on determining the minimal query that needs to be sent to each one. <p> However, the issue of choosing an optimal query execution plan to access the web sources has received relatively little attention in the data integration literature <ref> [HKWY97] </ref>, and remains an active area of research. The additional challenges that are faced in query optimization over sources on the WWW is that we have few statistics on the data in the sources, and hence little information to evaluate the cost of query execution plans.

Hypertrees are ordered arc-labeled trees with two types of arcs, internal and external. Internal arcs are used to represent structured objects and external arcs are used to represent references (typically hyperlinks) among objects. Arcs are labeled with records. <p> The first subquery builds the Root, Paper, and Year pages, and the second one redefines each Year page by adding the "year" field to it.

Reference-contexts: Most importantly, since a negative answer from a complete source is meaningful, the data integration system can prune access to other sources. The problem of describing completeness of web sources and using this information for query processing is addressed in <ref> [Mot89, EGW94, Lev96, Dus97, AD98, FW97] </ref>.

A recent article <ref> [LG98] </ref> claims that close to 80% of the web is already in the hidden web. If our tools are to be able to benefit from data in the hidden web, we must develop techniques for identifying sites that generate web pages, classify them and automatically create query interfaces to them.

Reference-contexts: Most importantly, since a negative answer from a complete source is meaningful, the data integration system can prune access to other sources. The problem of describing completeness of web sources and using this information for query processing is addressed in <ref> [Mot89, EGW94, Lev96, Dus97, AD98, FW97] </ref>. The work described in [FKL97] describes a probabilistic formalism for describing the contents and overlaps among information sources, and presents algorithms for choosing optimally between sources.

Reference-contexts: Using YAT, a web site designer writes a set of rules converting from the raw data into an abstract syntax tree of the resulting HTML, without going through an intermediate logical representation phase. In fact, in a similar way, other languages for data conversation (such as <ref> [MZ98, MPP + 93, PMSL94] </ref>) can also be used to build web sites. The WIRM system [JB97] is similar in spirit to the above systems in that it enables users to build web sites in which in which the pages can be viewed context-sensitive views of the underlying data.

Reference-contexts: In fact, some of the concepts developed in this community are already being adapted to the XML context [DFF + 98, GMW98]. Other projects under way in the database community in the area of metadata architectures and languages (e.g. <ref> [MRT98, KMSS98] </ref>) are likely to take advantage of and merge with the XML framework. A second trend that will affect the applicability of database techniques for querying the web is the growth of the so-called hidden web.

Reference-contexts: In addition to developing models and query languages for semistructured data, there has been considerable recent work on issues concerning the management of semistructured data, such as the extraction of structure from semistructured data <ref> [NAM98] </ref>, view maintenance [ZGM98, AMR + 98], summarization of semistructured data ([BDFS97, GW97]), and reasoning about semistructured data [CGL98, FFLS98].

Reference-contexts: The additional challenges that are faced in query optimization over sources on the WWW is that we have few statistics on the data in the sources, and hence little information to evaluate the cost of query execution plans. The work in <ref> [NGT98] </ref> considers the problem of calibrating the cost model for query execution plans in this context. The work in [YPAGM98] discusses the problem of query optimization for fusion queries, which are a special class of integration queries that focus on retrieving various attributes of a given object from multiple sources.

Reference-contexts: As it turns out, the same techniques are required for both of these classes. Furthermore, we note that the task of providing a web interface to data that exists in a single database system <ref> [NS96] </ref> is a simple instance of the problem of creating web sites. 3 To understand the problem of building web sites and the possible import of database technology, consider the tasks that a web site builder must address: (1) choosing and accessing the data that will be displayed at the site,

Reference-contexts: In order to do so, the system requires a set of source descriptions. Several recent research works addressed the problem of how to specify source descriptions and how to use them for query reformulation. Broadly speaking, two general approaches have been proposed: Global as view (GAV) <ref> [GMPQ + 97, PAGM96, ACPS96, HKWY97, FRV96, TRV98] </ref> and Local as view (LAV) [LRO96, KW96, DG97a, DG97b, FW97] (see [Ull97] for a detailed comparison).

Reference-contexts: In particular, G and G+ are based on labeled graphs; they support regular path expressions and graph construction in queries. GraphLog, whose semantics is based on Datalog, was applied to Hypertext queries in [CM89]. Paredaens et al <ref> [PdBA + 92] </ref> developed a graph query language for object-oriented databases. Languages for querying semistructured data: Query languages for semistructured data such as Lorel [AQM + 97], UnQL [BDHS96] and StruQL [FFLS97] also use labeled graphs as a flexible data model.

It should be noted that Machine Learning methods have also been used to learn the mapping between the source schemas and the mediated schemas <ref> [PE95, DEW97] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, a declarative representation of the web site's structure also supports easy evolution of a web site's structure. For example, to reorganize pages based on frequent usage patterns <ref> [PE97] </ref>, or to extend the site's content, simply rewrite the site-definition query, as opposed to rewriting a set of programs or a set of HTML files. Declarative specification of web sites can offer other advantages.

Reference-contexts: Araneus [AMM97b] uses a more structured data model, ADM, and provides a language for transforming data into ADM and a language for creating web sites from data modeled in ADM. In addition, Araneus uses web-specific constructs in the data model. The Autoweb <ref> [PF98] </ref> system is based on the hypermedia design model (HDM), a design tool for hypermedia applications. <p> In that view, a web site has many similarities to non-web information systems. Designing such a web site requires extending information systems design methodologies <ref> [AMM98, PF98] </ref>. Using these principles to build web sites will also impact the way we query the web and the way we integrate data from multiple web sources. Several trends will have significant impact on the use of database technology for web applications. The first is, of course, XML.
