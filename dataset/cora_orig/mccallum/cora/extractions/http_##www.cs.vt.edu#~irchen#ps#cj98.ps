Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the performance of forwarding strategies for location management in a Personal Communication Services (PCS) mobile network. A forwarding strategy in the PCS network can be implemented by two mechanisms: a forwarding operation which follows a chain of databases to locate a mobile user, and a resetting operation which updates the databases in the chain so that the current location of a mobile user can be known directly without having to follow a chain of databases. In this paper, we consider the PCS network as a server whose function is to provide services to the mobile user for "updating the location of the user as the user moves across a database boundary" and "locating the mobile user." We use a Markov chain to describe the behavior of the mobile user and analyze the best time when forwarding and resetting should be performed in order to optimize the service rate of the PCS network. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach with hexagonal and mesh coverage models for the PCS network and provide a physical interpretation of the result.

Reference-contexts: It is also not clear how their cost measure can be extended to a more general case in which multiple calls may be placed simultaneously for the same mobile user. Another related work is by Bar-Noy and Kessler <ref> [1] </ref> who considered a cost measure in terms of the expected number of forwarding steps required to locate a mobile user for a given update rate.

Reference-contexts: In recent years, various location management strategies based on the concept of forwarding have been proposed and studied in the literature <ref> [5, 11] </ref> with the goal of minimizing the network signaling and fl Ing-Ray Chen is with Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, Northern Virginia Center, 7054 Haycock Road, Falls Church, VA 22043, USA. <p> Contact Person: Ing-Ray Chen; telephone: (703) 538-8370; fax: (703) 538-8348; email: irchen@cs.vt.edu. 1 database loads. The basic mechanisms involved in implementing these forwarding strategies are "forwarding" and "resetting" operations. The "forwarding" operation means that when a mobile user moves across a database boundary (e.g., a registration area boundary <ref> [5] </ref> or a base station boundary [11]), only a pointer is set-up between the two involved databases, while the "resetting" operation means that all databases along the forwarding chain for locating a mobile user are updated all at once so that after the update the current location of the mobile user <p> Their analysis, however, is mainly for comparing the performance of various dynamic updating strategies in a ring cellular topology without using the concept of forwarding. Thus, a search for locating a mobile user through a chain of forwarding pointers was not considered. In <ref> [5] </ref>, Jain et al. proposed a per-user cost measure to characterize the benefit of forwarding over non-forwarding mechanisms. <p> The time that a particular mobile user stays within a visitor database before moving to another one is characterized by an exponential distribution with an average rate of . Such a parameter can be estimated using the approach described in <ref> [5, 8] </ref> on a per user basis. The interarrival time between two consecutive calls to a particular mobile user, regardless of the current location of the user, is also assumed to be exponentially distributed with an average rate of . <p> In other words, since the user is not called very often relative to it moves, it is worthless to minimize the search time per call by performing resetting operations frequently. These trends correlate well with those reported in <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This behavior is described by a hidden transition from state (C; i) back to itself with a transition rate of . This type of transition is not shown in Figure 2 since it does not need to be considered when solving a Markov chain <ref> [6] </ref>. Note that this implies that in state (C; i) the number of requests accumulated to locate the mobile user may be greater than 1. 3. <p> The possibility of the system moving from a given state to a neighboring state depends on the relative magnitude of the transition rates of the corresponding competing events; only one state transition is possible at a time. The Markov chain shown in Figure 2 is ergodic <ref> [6] </ref>, which means that all states have a non-zero probability. The probability that the system is found in a particular state in equilibrium also depends on the relative magnitude of the outgoing and incoming transition rates.

Reference-contexts: When applying the Markov model developed in this section, we have to parameterize it based on the specific characteristics of the signaling network under consideration. In this paper, we use a software package called SHARPE <ref> [12] </ref> 11 to solve P j 's and subsequently compute X for a parameterized Markov model. 4 Performance Analysis In this Section, we first discuss the parameterization process, i.e., how to estimate values for the parameters of the Markov model in Figure 2. <p> The data shown in Figure 4 were obtained by solving the Markov model shown in Figure 2 for each k value ranging from 2 to 32, using the SHARPE software package <ref> [12] </ref> to first obtain the P j for each state j and then compute X based on Equation (1). From Figure 4, we observe that there exists an optimal k value for each CMR value.
