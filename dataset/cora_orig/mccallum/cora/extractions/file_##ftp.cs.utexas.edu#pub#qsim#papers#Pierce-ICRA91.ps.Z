Abstract: We demonstrate a learning method by which a mobile robot may analyze an initially uninterpreted sensorimotor apparatus and produce a useful characterization of its set of actions. By "initially uninterpreted" we mean that the robot is given no knowledge of the structure of its sensory system nor of the effects of its actions. It merely sees and produces vectors of real numbers. We apply the method to the case of a simulated robot with an array of 16 range finders and a motor apparatus with which it can make combinations of turning and advancing actions. The robot learns a set of primitive actions allowing it to make pure turns (both clockwise and counterclockwise) and pure travels. We believe our approach is robust and will apply in general to sensory systems which may be used for motion detection (such as arrays of photoreceptors or range finders).

Reference-contexts: The raw data used in this analysis is the history. The history may be represented as a function of type 1 HIST = (Z + 0 fi [0 : : : (ns 1)] ! <ref> [1; 1] </ref>) where ns is the number of sense components and h (t; c) gives the value of component c at time t. Thus, for example, h (t; 0) is the value of the at-food sensor at time t. <p> 0 fi [0...(ns - 1)] ! [-1,1] Dist'n (DIST): p : [0...(nb - 1)] ! R + 0 Operators on Histories Time Derivative: @ t : HIST ! HIST Dist'n Operator: D c : HIST ! DIST analyzing sense histories. a sense component, c, partitions the range of c (i.e., <ref> [1; 1] </ref>) into a number of subintervals or "bins" and associates with each subinterval the number of times in the history that the value of component c lay in that subinterval. <p> The operator D is of type HIST ! DIST. We define D c as follows: D c fhg (i) = t b i (h (t; c)) where b i (x) = 0; otherwise Here, bin i is the ith subinterval in the distribution's par tition of the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. The summation is taken over all values of t for which h is defined. Another useful operator is the operator @ t , mapping histories into histories, which can be viewed as taking the derivative of a complete history with respect to time. <p> This mapping is obtained as follows: The space of actions is divided up into a set of boxes. For example, if there are two components to the action vector (na = 2), we divide up each component's range (i.e., <ref> [1; 1] </ref>) into a number of subintervals (we used 11). The entire space of actions is thus divided into 11 na = 121 boxes.
