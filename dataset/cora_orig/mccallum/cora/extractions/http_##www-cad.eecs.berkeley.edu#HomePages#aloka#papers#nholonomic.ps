Reference-contexts: A number of people have studied this problem. Nakamura and Mukherjee [5] used the Lyapunov 1 design methodology to converge the joint angles and the orientation of the satellite to the final state. Vafa and Dubowsky <ref> [1] </ref> used the notion of virtual space manipulator to control the satellite orientation while moving the manipulator attached to it arbitrarily. Longman, Lindberg and Zadd [2] have also discussed the coupling of a manipulator motion and the vehicle motion. <p> The Lyapunov function can get caught in a local minima and in which case the final configuration of the system wouldn't be the desired final configuration. 3 3 Virtual Manipulators In this approach by Vafa and Dubowsky <ref> [1] </ref>, the satellite and the manipulator/solar-panels attached to it are transformed to a virtual manipulator and the control strategy is derived by looking at the virtual manipulator. The Virtual Manipulator is a massless kinematic chain. The virtual ground is an imaginary base to which the virtual manipulators base is attached.

Walsh in his thesis <ref> [4] </ref> has studied the problem of reorienting a linked rigid body (with three links) in space with internal motions. Hereafter I will restrict my discussion to a satellite with two solar panels or with a manipulator with two links, unless otherwise stated.

Reference-contexts: Since the angular momentum conservation works as a non-holonomic constraint, it so happens that we actually can control the orientation of the satellite as well as the manipulator/solar-panels just by the relative motion of the manipulator/solar-panels. A number of people have studied this problem. Nakamura and Mukherjee <ref> [5] </ref> used the Lyapunov 1 design methodology to converge the joint angles and the orientation of the satellite to the final state. Vafa and Dubowsky [1] used the notion of virtual space manipulator to control the satellite orientation while moving the manipulator attached to it arbitrarily. <p> The actual control strategy involves designing an appropriate Lyapunov function which would enable the choice of the control variable u for the system. The interested reader can see <ref> [5] </ref>. The authors have proposed a Lyapunov function based on reducing the the error of the final orientation of the satellite and the manipulator taking into account the nonlinearity of the satellite/manipulator system.
