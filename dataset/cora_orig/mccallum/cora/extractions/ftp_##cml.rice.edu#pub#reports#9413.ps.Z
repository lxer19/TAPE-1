Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The main purpose if this paper is to describe a wavelet variation of the frequency decomposition method of Hackbusch <ref> [4] </ref>. Our method is applied to an anisotropic elliptic model problem with periodic boundary conditions. We are able to achieve robustness of the resulting two-level method with respect to any intermediate level in the corresponding recursive multilevel process. This is an improvement over the results given in [4] where only the <p> method of Hackbusch <ref> [4] </ref>. Our method is applied to an anisotropic elliptic model problem with periodic boundary conditions. We are able to achieve robustness of the resulting two-level method with respect to any intermediate level in the corresponding recursive multilevel process. This is an improvement over the results given in [4] where only the robustness of the two-level method of the starting level is demonstrated. The main tool we use is perfect reconstruction property associated with the wavelet system. In Section 2, we describe the main aspects of the Wavelet-Galerkin spaces, the wavelet packets and an frequency decomposition multilevel algorithm. <p> 3 we consider another application of this method to a problem in which the solution has large gradients in the interior of the domain, which seems to be quite effective. 2 Anisotropic Equations In this section, we present a wavelet variation of the "Frequency decomposition multigrid method " of Hackbusch <ref> [4] </ref> to solve the following model problem: * @x 2 u (x; y) @y 2 u (x; y) + u (x; y) = f (x; y) in = (0; s) 2 ; (1) u periodic ; (2) where we assume 0 &lt; * 1; and s is a positive integer. <p> One way is to choose a sophisticated basic iterative method (BIM) as done e.g. in [12] and [14]. However, the performance of such improved BIM (incomplete LU decomposition [14], block versions of the Gau-Seidel relaxation [12]) can be limited, see Chapter 10 in <ref> [4] </ref>, especially for 3D applications. A modification of the coarse grid correction opens another way towards robustness, [4] and [9]. It allows one to use simple pointwise smoothers which in general can be parallelized. <p> However, the performance of such improved BIM (incomplete LU decomposition [14], block versions of the Gau-Seidel relaxation [12]) can be limited, see Chapter 10 in <ref> [4] </ref>, especially for 3D applications.

Reference-contexts: It is simply because that the solution has large gradients near the boundary, in the standard multilevel process, only the smooth part of the error is corrected at the coarser level. But if we replace the BIM by an extra coarser grid correction as in <ref> [5] </ref>, we are able to correct the high frequency part of the error at coarser level, as well.
