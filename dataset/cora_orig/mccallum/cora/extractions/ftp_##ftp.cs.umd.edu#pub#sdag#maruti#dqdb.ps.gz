Title: On Guaranteed Delivery of Time-Critical Messages in DQDB  
Author: Debanjan Saha Manas C. Saksena Sarit Mukherjee Satish K. Tripathi 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of guaranteed delivery of messages with hard deadlines in a DQDB network. We present a cyclic reservation scheme capable of allocating bandwidth with any arbitrary granularity and provide deterministic delay guarantees. We propose two implementations of the allocation scheme within the framework of DQDB medium access control protocol. The proposed implementations are very simple, incur minimal overhead and require only minor changes in the adopted standard.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) has been standardized by the IEEE <ref> [1] </ref> in 1990 and has been adopted as the standard for metropolitan area network. In the current form, the DQDB medium access control (MAC) protocol offers two types of services: asynchronous and isochronous. <p> The details of the implementation are presented in section 5. Finally, we conclude in section 6. 2 DQDB MAC Protocol In this section we briefly describe the DQDB media access control protocol. For a detailed description of the protocol, the reader is refered to <ref> [1] </ref>. The DQDB is a distributed multi-access network that supports integrated communication. In particular, the DQDB subnetwork supports connectionless data transfer, connection oriented data transfer and isochronous communication. In this section we describe the dual bus architecture and the protocol by which the nodes communicate.

Reference-contexts: We propose to enhance the DQDB MAC protocol to offer services that support such quality of service requirements. There have been several studies on bandwidth allocation for hard real-time communication <ref> [2, 7, 9, 10] </ref>. However, most of them are not applicable to the dual-bus architecture. In [9], a global priority scheme is used to guarantee deadlines of messages in dual-bus networks.

Reference-contexts: Through informal reasoning and simulation the authors analyze the performance of their protocol. Although their scheme is adequate for soft real time traffic, it falls short of guaranteeing hard real time constraints. Similarly, the guaranteed bandwidth protocol <ref> [3] </ref>, proposed to provide connection oriented service using the queued arbitrated slots, does not provide deterministic guarantees on delay, as required for hard real-time traffic. We present a bandwidth allocation scheme [8] based on cyclic reservation.

Reference-contexts: The isochronous service uses pre-arbitrated access to the bus, and is intended for connection-oriented traffic, like voice and video. Numerous studies have been performed on the asynchronous service, in terms of its performance and fairness properties. However, there is very little literature on isochronous services <ref> [4] </ref>. In this paper we address the bandwidth allocation and slot scheduling schemes necessary to offer services that can provide deterministic performance guarantees. More specifically, we propose a bandwidth allocation scheme that can be implemented on DQDB, and provides deterministic guarantee on the worst case message transmission delay.

Reference-contexts: In [9], a global priority scheme is used to guarantee deadlines of messages in dual-bus networks. This scheme is not very suitable for DQDB since it requires a large number of priority levels (which is not supported in DQDB) to avoid priority inversion. In <ref> [6] </ref> a request control scheme is proposed to guarantee bandwidth for queued arbitrated access. Through informal reasoning and simulation the authors analyze the performance of their protocol. Although their scheme is adequate for soft real time traffic, it falls short of guaranteeing hard real time constraints.

We present a bandwidth allocation scheme <ref> [8] </ref> based on cyclic reservation. But unlike other cyclic reservation schemes, where bandwidth can be allocated only in multiples of a basic quantum, in our scheme allocation can be done with arbitrary granularity. To better appreciate this enhanced flexibility lets consider a simple example.
