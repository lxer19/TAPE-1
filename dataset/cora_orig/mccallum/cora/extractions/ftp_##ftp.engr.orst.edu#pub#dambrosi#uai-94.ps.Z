Reference-contexts: In this paper we discuss application of the SPI local expression language <ref> [1] </ref> to efficient inference in large BN2O networks. In particular, we show that there is significant structure which can be exploited to improve over the Quickscore result. We further describe how symbolic techniques can provide information which can significantly reduce the computation required for computing all cause posterior marginals. <p> It is compact (linear in the number of antecedents), captures the structure of the interaction, and, as Heckerman has shown [2], can be manually manipulated to perform efficient inference. However, it is not sufficiently formal to permit automated inference. We define in <ref> [1] </ref> a formal syntax for a local expression language. This language permits descrition of the dependence of a node on its parents in terms of simple arithmetic expressions over partial distributions.

Reference-contexts: When evidence is available on child variables, computation of the posterior probability of parents is exponential in the number of positive pieces of evidence, but linear in the number of pieces of negative evidence, as shown in Heckerman <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> It is compact (linear in the number of antecedents), captures the structure of the interaction, and, as Heckerman has shown <ref> [2] </ref>, can be manually manipulated to perform efficient inference. However, it is not sufficiently formal to permit automated inference. We define in [1] a formal syntax for a local expression language. <p> This table provides some evidence that the computational gains from the methods described are real. Heckerman reported in <ref> [2] </ref> processing 9 positive findings in one minute. In 32 minutes, then quickscore should be able to process about 14 positive findings. Comparing run times of different implementations on different platforms is a difficult task, and conclusions must be carefully drawn.

Reference-contexts: Doing this, followed by application of commutativity, changes evaluation complexity from exponential in the number of diseases to ex ponential in the number of positive findings and linear in the number of diseases (this is the basic Quickscore result <ref> [3] </ref>, re-interpreted). Since the number of positive findings is usually much lower than the number of diseases, this is advantageous. Consider, for example, a fully connected BN2O net (ie, every disease is a parent of every finding) with three diseases and two symptoms.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we present a novel approximation technique with pre liminary experimental results. In this paper we discuss application of Symbolic Probabilistic Inference (SPI) to the problem of computing disease posteriors in the QMR-DT BN2O network . A BN2O network <ref> [4] </ref> is a two level network in which parent (disease) interactions at a child (symptom) are modeled using the noisy-or interaction model [6]. The QMR-DT network is a very large network, with over 600 diseases, 4000 findings, and 40,000 disease-finding links.

Reference-contexts: The local expression language, by explicitly capturing independence at the value-specific level, permits exploitation of this structure. One could pose an optimization question of the form we have previously posed for standard belief net inference <ref> [5] </ref>: identify that form in which an expression is least expensive to evaluate. We have work in progress to formulate the general problem for arbitrary local expressions. In this paper we present a simple greedy algorithm family based on intuitions derived from considering the above example.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we discuss application of Symbolic Probabilistic Inference (SPI) to the problem of computing disease posteriors in the QMR-DT BN2O network . A BN2O network [4] is a two level network in which parent (disease) interactions at a child (symptom) are modeled using the noisy-or interaction model <ref> [6] </ref>. The QMR-DT network is a very large network, with over 600 diseases, 4000 findings, and 40,000 disease-finding links. Some findings have as many as 150 parents, and a case can have as many as 50 positive findings. Exact inference would, then, seem intractable. <p> If the interaction between the effects of 1 and 2 on 1 in the net shown in figure 1 can be modeled as a noisy-or interaction, then we might write the following ex pression for the dependence of 1 on 1 and 2, following Pearl <ref> [6] </ref>: ( 1 = ) = 1 (1 ( 1 1 = )) ( 1 = ) = (1 ( 1 1 = )) Where ( 1 1 = ) is the probability that 1 is true given that 1 is true and 2 is false.
