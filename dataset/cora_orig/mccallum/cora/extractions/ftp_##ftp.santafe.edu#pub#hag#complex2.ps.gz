Topological skeleton. <p> In some sense (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>) the more complex the rule, the more the present state of the system encodes the entire history of its production. The statistical inverse iteration procedure is one general way to exploit this record, albeit imperfectly. Chaotic, relatively uncomplex, rules forget their history.

Reference-contexts: This interesting system has a number of practical problems, some linked to the linearity of the tent map which have been cryptanalytically exploited by Biham <ref> [2] </ref>, some linked to the continuity of the map which can lead to round-off errors. These round-off error problems do not occur in the cellular automaton based system to which we now turn.

Reference-contexts: comprehension of the correct representation of a system as it does with the distribution over the classes in a given representation (see 3 The CA system mentioned above does not fall prey to this attack since it is composed of several different rules performing different stages of encryption. 16 Crutchfield <ref> [3] </ref> for a related discussion). A powerful tool, well-adapted to the given system, may pull out enough predictability from it that it would be considered "broken" by the cryptanalyst, even though worthwhile mysteries may remain for the physicist.

Reference-contexts: One way to apply computation theory to physics is to find a map from the behavior of the physical system onto the operation of a computing machine. Various approaches are described in <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. CA, like many physical systems, are governed by local, translationally invariant, interactions. The connections with computers, in particular parallel computers, derive from considering each cell in the cellular automaton as performing logical operations on its inputs.

Reference-contexts: A provable ideal practical encryption method in this sense in not yet known. For the state of the art see e.g. <ref> [5] </ref>. Cryptographic research proceeds by the proposition of cryptosystems, followed by attempts to break the the proposed systems. To break a cryptosystem means to discover the meaning of messages encrypted by the system without being handed the secret key.

Hence, the halting time is related to the "logical depth" of the halting configuration. 1 Grassberger <ref> [6] </ref> argued that no single quantity is sufficient to measure complexity, since much depends on how meaning is assigned to this term.

Reference-contexts: It appears generally that transient and cycle lengths are constant for simple rules, exponential for chaotic rules, and power-law (or some more exotic scaling) for complex rules. Some evidence <ref> [7] </ref> suggests that transients and cycles for a given chaotic rule normally scale following the same law, while complex rules may exhibit features which scale in different ways.

Reference-contexts: Consider a state produced after many iterations of a cellular automaton. Even though most backward paths from this state are short, it has at least one long backward path. How can this path be found? One approach <ref> [8] </ref> is to limit search to preimages which are highly probable under the natural measure. The reasoning is as follows: Assume we know the natural measure 8 of the rule.

Reference-contexts: These round-off error problems do not occur in the cellular automaton based system to which we now turn. The problems of linearity and round-off error can be solved by using CA instead of smooth dynamical systems. A cryptosystem illustrating this idea has been developed <ref> [9] </ref>. In this system, a message is encoded as a state of the system, and various cellular automaton rules are applied to it to produce a new state which is the ciphertext. To decrypt, the same cellular automa 13 ton rules are applied in reverse order.

Reference-contexts: Reversible rules are also used for some stages of encryption to provide full non-linearity. Figure 3 gives some idea of how this system works. Full details are beyond the scope of this article, and may be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. It is useful to briefly consider an attack on one stage of the encryption. It contains the lesson which is the main point of this section. In this stage, an irreversible cellular automaton is run backward by repeated and randomly selecting preimages.

Reference-contexts: Many practical problems remain, however, concerning how to choose good public-key/private-key pairs, how these should be applied to encrypt a message, etc. Consider now a system proposed by Habutsu et. al. <ref> [12] </ref>. This system uses both forward and inverse iteration of a dynamical system. The very significant difference here is that the dynamical system used by Habutsu et al. is irreversible. An irreversible system is one in which some states have none, or more than one, antecedent state.

Reference-contexts: Reversible CA may be particularly valuable in public-key encryption. A public-key cryptosystem uses two keys, one key is used for encryption, the other for decryption. One key is held in private, the other rendered public. Kari <ref> [13] </ref> has proposed a system in which the public key is a cellular automaton inverse to the private key cellular automaton. The security of 12 public-key cryptosystems depends on the difficulty of finding the private key given knowledge of the public key and/or chosen plain and ciphertext.

Reference-contexts: The security of 12 public-key cryptosystems depends on the difficulty of finding the private key given knowledge of the public key and/or chosen plain and ciphertext. Kari bases much of his reasoning on a result of his <ref> [14] </ref> which shows that even deciding whether a given cellular automaton in more than one dimension has an inverse is impossible. In general, the mathematical theory of cellular automata which is relevant to cryptography is more well-developed than the theory of irreversible cellular automata.

Reference-contexts: Given all this, one could expect that for r and n sufficiently large, no effective procedure could find the cellular automata which relates a ciphertext to the corresponding plaintext, and claim that the system is ultimately complex. But note the following <ref> [16] </ref>: If we knew two configurations adjacent in time, c t and c t+1 , then we could read off the cellular automaton rule by comparing the two configurations.

Reference-contexts: Anyone who does not know the initial state would not be able to recreate the trajectory and thus would not be able to disentangle it from the encrypted message. One version of this idea <ref> [17] </ref> employs cellular automaton rule 30 to generate temporal sequences which have a high degree of randomness [18]. The secret key is the initial state of the system. Senders run the initial state forward under the rule, and XOR's the temporal sequence generated with their message to produces a ciphertext.
