Title: Interpolating Subdivision for Meshes with Arbitrary Topology  
Author: Denis Zorin Peter Schroder Wim Sweldens 
Abstract: Subdivision is a powerful paradigm for the generation of surfaces of arbitrary topology. Given an initial triangular mesh the goal is to produce a smooth and visually pleasing surface whose shape is controlled by the initial mesh. Of particular interest are interpolating schemes since they match the original data exactly, and play an important role in fast multiresolution and wavelet techniques. Dyn, Gregory, and Levin introduced the Butterfly scheme, which yields C 1 surfaces in the topologically regular setting. Unfortunately it exhibits undesirable artifacts in the case of an irregular topology. We examine these failures and derive an improved scheme, which retains the simplicity of the Butterfly scheme, is interpolating, and results in smoother surfaces.

Reference-contexts: We distinguish between four positions of the edge that we subdivide. 1. The edge connects two vertices of valence 6. In that case we use the extension of the Butterfly scheme to the ten point stencil <ref> [8] </ref> (see Figure 3a). This is the canonical setting and the weights are given by a = 1=2 w; b = 1=8 + 2w; c = 1=16 w; d = w where w can be chosen suitably small [8] (we used w = 0). 2. <p> use the extension of the Butterfly scheme to the ten point stencil <ref> [8] </ref> (see Figure 3a).

Reference-contexts: The most common interpolating scheme is based on piecewise linears. Unfortunately this is not smooth enough for many applications.

The mathematical analysis of the surfaces resulting from subdivision is not always straightforward (see for example Reif [20]).

Reference-contexts: Nasri [17] presents such a modification for the Doo-Sabin scheme, while Halstead et al. <ref> [11] </ref> do the same for the Catmull-Clark scheme. Both cases have a number of limitations. For example, it is unclear under what conditions the linear system to be solved for the interpolation constraints is solvable. Additionally, the interpolation conditions are only satisfied in the limit. <p> This property is only partially covered by such notions as C k tinuity, e.g., a C 2 function may be quite wiggly. Absence of unnecessary undulations is often referred to as fairness. For example, Halstead, et al. <ref> [11] </ref> observed that enforcing interpolation conditions on Catmull-Clark surfaces resulted in a loss of fairness, an issue they addressed with a global optimization pass. In the present paper we do not consider the question of globally optimal fairness.
