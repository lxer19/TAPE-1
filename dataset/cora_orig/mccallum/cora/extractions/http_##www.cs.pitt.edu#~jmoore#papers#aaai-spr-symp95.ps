Abstract: Our two stage methodology for the study of cue usage coordinates an exhaustive corpus analysis with a system for text generation. Coding of the corpus uses Relational Discourse Analysis, a synthesis of two previous accounts of discourse structure. In the first stage of our study, hypotheses about cue usage are evaluated and refined using the corpus analysis. Several initial results concerning how cues mark segment structure are presented here. In the second stage of our study, the results of the corpus analysis are used to determine a set of heuristics to be implemented in a system for text generation. The automatic generation of texts is then used to exercise and further evaluate the heuristics for cue placement. Discourse cues play a crucial role in many discourse processing tasks, including plan recognition (Litman & Allen 1987), anaphora resolution (Grosz & Sidner 1986), and generation of coherent multisentential texts (Elhadad & McKeown 1990; Rosner & Stede 1992; Scott & de Souza 1990; Zukerman 1990). Cues are words or phrases such as because, first, although and also that mark structural and semantic relationships between discourse entities. Research in reading comprehension presents a mixed picture (Goldman & Murray 1992; Lorch 1989) suggesting that felicitous use of cues improves comprehension and recall, but that indiscriminate use of cues may have detrimental effects on recall (Millis, Graesser, & Haberlandt 1993) and that the benefit of cues may depend on the subjects' reading skill and level of domain knowledge. However, interpreting the research is problematic because the manipulation of cues both within and across studies has been very unsystematic (Lorch 1989). In this paper, we describe a methodology for identifying the factors that influence effective cue selection and placement. Our methodology coordinates linguistic analysis of "good texts" with a system for automatic generation of texts conforming to the rules identified by the corpus analysis. Our linguistic analysis, which we call Relational Discourse Analysis (RDA), is a synthesis of two accounts of discourse structure (Grosz & Sidner 1986; Mann & Thompson 1988) pre viously thought incompatible. We demonstrate the use of the analysis by presenting some hypotheses concerning how cues mark segment structure and the initial results for hypotheses from our corpus study. The generation system we are implementing will provide a means for evaluation and further refinement of our strategies for cue selection and placement. Our ultimate goal is to provide a text generation component that can be used in a variety of application systems. In addition, the text generator will provide a tool for the systematic construction of materials for reading comprehension experiments. The study is part of a project to improve the explanation component of a computer system that trains avionics technicians to troubleshoot complex electronic circuitry. The tutoring system gives the student a troubleshooting problem to solve, allows the student to solve the problem with minimal tutor interaction, and then provides a critique of the student's solution in a post-problem session. During this session, the system replays the solution step by step pointing out good aspects of the student's solution as well as ways in which the student's solution could be improved. To determine how to build an automated explanation component, we collected protocols of a human expert tutor providing explanations during the critiquing session. Because the explanation component we are building interacts with users via text and menus, the student and human tutor were required to communicate in written form. In addition, in order to study effective explanation, we chose experts who were rated as excellent tutors by their peers, students, and superiors. Because the recognition of discourse coherence and structure is complex and dependent on many types of non-linguistic knowledge, determining the way in which cues and other linguistic markers aid that recognition is a difficult problem. Our approach to the study of cues proceeds in two complementary stages. The first stage is the corpus study reported on here. The design of our corpus study is coordinated with a sys

Reference-contexts: The technique of representing an analysis in a database and then using database queries to test hypotheses is similar to work using RST analyses to investigate the form of purpose clauses <ref> (Vander Linden, Cumming, & Martin 1992) </ref>. Because our analysis is exhaustive, information about both occurrence and nonoccurrence of cues can be retrieved from the database in order to test and modify hypotheses about cue usage. That is, both cue-based and factor-based retrievals are possible.
