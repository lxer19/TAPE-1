Title: DECISION-THEORETIC ALLOCATION OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS RESOURCES

Abstract: This paper describes a decision-theoretic algorithm that allocates communications resources in a network simulation in a demand-assigned, multiple access (DAMA) manner. To "optimize" the results, the algorithm makes use of knowledge about the state of the system and environment and general network parameters. Performance comparisons of data throughput are made between the algorithm and two other types of allocation algorithms. In our experiment, the decision-theoretic allocation algorithm gives higher throughput than the other algorithms.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently, there have been positive results showing the advantages of a Demand-Assigned, Multiple Access (DAMA) algorithm over the current design of communications in the use of satellites for range extension of the Army's Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) network (see, for example, <ref> [7, 9, 1, 3, 6, 10] </ref>). The deficiency of a "non-DAMA" method is that the ground terminals use fixed-size "trunk groups" of aggregate data rates of 256, 512, or 1024 Kb/s. Even when only a fraction of the capacity is required, the whole trunk group must be sent and processed.

Reference-contexts: Decision theory shares some basic theory with mathematical programming/optimization techniques. However, most of those types of techniques are limited because domain assumptions must be made in order to model and solve the problem in a reasonable amount of time. Chan <ref> [2] </ref> provides a good example of using mathematical programming to solve a bandwidth allocation problem. However, for computational reasons, Chan relies on a greedy heuristic to solve the problem. Acknowledgements Thanks to Sastri Kota and Jim Landowski who provided key technical guidance and feedback.

Reference-contexts: The pieces of information listed above are treated as uncertain variables and formulated as inputs to the problem framed by Bayesian decision theory (Section A gives a background overview of the subject). The dependence and independence of the uncertain variables can be graphically represented in an influence diagram <ref> [4] </ref>. The influence diagram is easy to construct and interpret, yet has formal semantics making it suitable for automatic manipulation. An influence diagram represents variables as nodes of three shapes: ovals are uncertain variables, rectangles are decisions, and diamonds are value or utility variables.

Reference-contexts: In other work, we have used the MSE scenario in a testbed to do analysis of different network algorithms for routing and network flow control <ref> [8] </ref>. The MSE scenario is interesting because by augmenting the existing ground communication links with satellite links, the communication capability and capacity can be increased dramatically.
