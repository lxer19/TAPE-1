Reference-contexts: The description of sequential circuits, though, may not seem so easy to do. Our intent here is to show how a general finite state machine, an Algorithmic State Machine (ASM) module <ref> [1] </ref>, can be directly described in LIDEX . The Algorithmic State Machine is a well established technique for the design of digital circuits, particularly control units [2].
