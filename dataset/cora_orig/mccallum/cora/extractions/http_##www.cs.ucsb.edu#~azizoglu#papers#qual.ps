Reference-contexts: Also, they gave nontrivial lower bounds for the edge-boundary of m-element subsets of vertices in a 2 d-dimensional k-ary array. Building on this work, Ahlswede and Bezrukov <ref> [1] </ref> obtained the ex-tremal sets minimizing the edge-boundary in the d-dimensional infinite array. They also presented minimum-edge-boundary configurations for the 2-dimensional finite arrays. The difficulty with the higher dimensional cases is the nontrivial effect of the boundary. <p> possible cardinalities of the isoperimetric sets themselves, the following problem needs to be investigated; Problem : What are the cardinalities and the description of the isoperimetric sets in generalized d-dimensional arrays, i.e. the Cartesian product of paths of varying lengths, extending (3) and the 2-dimensional result of Ahlswede and Bezrukov <ref> [1] </ref>? 4 Complexity Issues for Partitioning Problems in Planar Graphs At present, there are many interesting open problems regarding the computation of small balanced edge-separators. In this section we identify a number of problems of algorithmic nature.

Reference-contexts: A placement of a graph is basically a distinguished subset of vertices in the vertex set of the graph. In placement partitioning the aim is to partition the vertices in a given placement into two balanced parts with minimal interaction. We gave (Azizoglu and Egecioglu <ref> [2] </ref>) an application of placement partitioning in the context of communication load balancing in interconnection networks extending the work of Blaum et al. [6]. It would also be interesting to investigate other applications of placement partitioning along with complexity issues on planar graphs.

Reference-contexts: In an attempt to compute the isoperimetric number of a d-dimensional k-ary array A d k by exploiting its recursive structure, i.e. A d k = P k fi A d1 k where P k is the n-vertex path, Azizoglu and Egecioglu <ref> [3] </ref> showed that i (P k fi G) = i (P k ) where G is any connected graph with k vertices. <p> That is, 1 where m = minfi (G 1 ); i (G 2 ); ; i (G n )g. However one cannot get a tight lower bound for i (A d k ) using this result, either. We proved (Azizoglu and Egecioglu <ref> [3] </ref>) that i (P k fi G) = i (P k ) where G is any connected graph with k vertices. Evidently i (P k ) i (G) for any connected k-vertex graph G. <p> Thus the inequality i (P k fi G) i (P k ) is easy to prove since we always have i (G fi H) minfi (G); i (H)g [24, 4]. The reverse inequality i (P k fiG) i (P k ) is proved in <ref> [3] </ref> by a technique similar to the one used by Mohar in [24] for the proof of the i (G fi K 2n ) result. <p> Note that we cannot hope to have i (P k fi G) = i (P k ) if i (G) &lt; i (P k ) since the isoperimetric number of a product graph is smaller than the isoperimetric number of each of its factors. In <ref> [3] </ref> it is shown that i (P k fi G) 6= i (P k ) if G is allowed to have more than k vertices even when i (G) i (P k ) and G is a tree.

Reference-contexts: Azizoglu and Egecioglu <ref> [4] </ref> later obtained the isoperimetric number of a d-dimensional k-ary array as well as the cardinalities of its isoperimetric sets. It is worth noting that for most families studied (e.g. <p> Evidently i (P k ) i (G) for any connected k-vertex graph G. Thus the inequality i (P k fi G) i (P k ) is easy to prove since we always have i (G fi H) minfi (G); i (H)g <ref> [24, 4] </ref>. The reverse inequality i (P k fiG) i (P k ) is proved in [3] by a technique similar to the one used by Mohar in [24] for the proof of the i (G fi K 2n ) result. <p> This is done by constructing a family of graphs (trees) in which, for any given k, there exists a graph G in the family with i (P k fiG) &lt; i (P k ). In a more recent work, we were able to obtain (Azizoglu and Egecioglu <ref> [4] </ref>) an exact formula for the isoperimetric number of a d-dimensional k-ary array by proving the following; i (A d 1 k k : (2) We have also shown that there are exactly d distinct cardinalities 1 2 (k d k); : : : ; 1 of isoperimetric sets in a <p> The case with even k was proved by Leighton [19] using a similar embedding method. We extended these techniques in <ref> [4] </ref> to give a tight lower bound for the isoperimetric number of arrays as follows. <p> Finally the resulting inequality is proved by induction on a recurrence relation for the edge-boundary of the first m vertices of K d k in the label ordering. The details appear in Azizoglu and Egecioglu <ref> [4] </ref>. For both odd and even k, the cardinalities of the isoperimetric sets are found by showing that the ratio j@Xj=jXj becomes equal to i (A d k ) only when X is a subset having one of the specified cardinalities. <p> These cardinalities are the zeros of a certain expression derived from the recurrence relation mentioned above. 6 The computation of the isoperimetric number and cardinalities of the isoperimetric sets in a d-dimensional k-ary array bring about the following problems for further investigation; Problem : Can the techniques in <ref> [4] </ref> be extended to obtain the isoperimetric number of generalized d-dimensional arrays, i.e. the Cartesian product of paths of varying lengths? In light of the present results, it is reasonable to conjecture that i (P k 1 fi P k 2 fi fi P k d ) = min 1 k

Bui and Peck [11] extended these techniques to compute RCU T SET P in O (b 2 n 3 2 4:5b ) time where b is the size of the optimal cut.

Reference-contexts: They also posed the problem of determining the configurations in the discrete torus which minimize the vertex-boundary among all m-element sets of vertices for a given m [32]. Bollobas and Leader <ref> [7] </ref> gave a partial solution to this problem. Specifically, they described the extremal sets minimizing the vertex-boundary for a d-dimensional k-ary torus where k is even.

Reference-contexts: Bollobas and Leader <ref> [8] </ref> also described the structure of the extremal sets minimizing the vertex-boundary of the d-dimensional k-ary array. The extremal sets in these results are nested, that is, they are initial segments of a fixed linear ordering on the vertices of the graph. <p> Eigenvalue arguments also fail to give a tight bound for i (A d k ). However it is true by eigenvalue arguments that in general minfi (G); i (H)g i (G fi H) cannot be too large [24]. Bollobas and Leader <ref> [8] </ref> proved the first lower bound for the edge-boundary of a subset of vertices in a d-dimensional k-ary array. In their proof, they consider the continuous analogue of this problem as well as "compression operators" which are the standard method in proving results of this nature.

Reference-contexts: Such vertex configurations for the hypercube was given by Harper [17]. As before, this work was later extended by Lindsey [20] who described extremal sets minimizing the edge-boundary of a d-dimensional k-ary clique. In their important work, Bollobas and Leader <ref> [9] </ref> pointed out the equivalence, in regular graphs, of configurations minimizing the edge-boundary with those maximizing the edge-interior, i.e. the set of edges spanned by a set of m vertices for a given m.

Reference-contexts: Their reduction uses M AXCU T (see [15] for the definition of this problem) and since the constructed instance of BISECT ION may be highly nonplanar it does not yield an N P - completeness result for planar graphs. Bui et al. <ref> [10] </ref> gave a proof which shows BISECT ION is N P -complete even for d-regular graphs having a bisection of size no more than b whenever d 3 and b = n * for any fixed * 2 (0; 1).

Reference-contexts: The computation of the bisection width of an n-vertex tree can be done in O (n 2 ) time using the techniques of Baker [5].

Due to the Turing reducibility of ISON U M to RCU T SET , the results of Bui and Peck <ref> [11] </ref> and Papadimitriou and Sideri [26] for the RCU T SET problem apply to the ISON U M problem within their respective classes of graphs, under the same conditions (solidness). Fortunately, however, there are stronger results which do not depend on such conditions.

Reference-contexts: For general graphs, the N P -completeness of the bisection width problem was shown by Garey et al. in <ref> [14] </ref> using a reduction from the M AXCU T problem (see [15] for the definition of this problem). The N P -completeness of the isoperimetric number problem for general (simple) graphs was proved by Golovach [16] by a reduction from the bisection width problem. <p> Clearly, for any class of graphs, the N P -completeness of BISECT ION implies N P -completeness of RCU T SET . BISECT ION (hence RCU T SET ) for general graphs was shown to be N P -complete by Garey et al. <ref> [14] </ref>. Their reduction uses M AXCU T (see [15] for the definition of this problem) and since the constructed instance of BISECT ION may be highly nonplanar it does not yield an N P - completeness result for planar graphs. <p> the case that the planarity constraints imposed upon this class of graphs may render this seemingly hard problem polynomially solvable as is the case for M AXCU T , which is an N P -complete problem in general but becomes polynomially solvable when restricted to the class of planar graphs <ref> [14] </ref>. SP RSST when restricted to triconnected outerplanar graphs is polynomially solvable by an algorithm of Matula and Shahrokhi [23] in O (n 2 p log n) time for an n-vertex graph. They also give a linear time algorithm for computing the sparsity ratio of trees.

Reference-contexts: The N P -completeness of the isoperimetric number problem for general (simple) graphs was proved by Golovach <ref> [16] </ref> by a reduction from the bisection width problem. An important 3 problem which is very similar to the isoperimetric number problem is the sparsest cut problem where the denominator in the ratio involves the product of the sizes of the two parts, as opposed to their minimum. <p> ISON U M (hence, BLIM Q since it is more general) is N P -complete for general graphs. This was shown by a reduction from BISECT ION by Golovach in <ref> [16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: research are highlighted as Problems, although the body of the proposal also discusses current gaps in theory which I feel are worthy of study in their own right. 2 Summary of Previous Work 2.1 Isoperimetric Structures on Graphs As one of the first basic results in this area, Harper in <ref> [17] </ref> described the extremal sets minimizing the vertex-boundary on the hypercube. Harper's result was later extended to d-dimensional k-ary clique by Lindsey [20]. Wang and Wang [31] gave a linear ordering of the vertices of the d-dimensional infinite grid which minimizes the vertex-boundary. <p> The extremal sets in these results are nested, that is, they are initial segments of a fixed linear ordering on the vertices of the graph. Extremal sets minimizing the edge-boundary have also been described in the literature. Such vertex configurations for the hypercube was given by Harper <ref> [17] </ref>. As before, this work was later extended by Lindsey [20] who described extremal sets minimizing the edge-boundary of a d-dimensional k-ary clique.

Reference-contexts: In this case the minimum ratio is called the sparsity ratio. The relevance of this problem stems from the fact that the isoperimetric number of a graph is related by a constant factor to its sparsity ratio <ref> [18] </ref>. Matula and Shahrokhi [23] proved that this problem is N P -complete in general graphs via a reduction from the M AXCU T problem. The computation of the bisection width of an n-vertex tree can be done in O (n 2 ) time using the techniques of Baker [5]. <p> Given a graph G = (V; E), the 9 sparsity ratio of G is defined as (G) = min jE (X; X )j jXjjXj : The following relation holds for an n-vertex graph G <ref> [18] </ref> n (G) i (G) n (G); since the number of vertices in the big half of a cut must lie between n 2 and n.

Reference-contexts: A vertex-separator for a graph is similarly defined. In this proposal, we are mostly interested in graph partitioning which employs edge removal methods, as opposed to vertex removal. However, it should be pointed out that Lipton and Tarjan <ref> [21] </ref> are among the first to prove a separator theorem for the class of planar graphs.

Reference-contexts: In this case the minimum ratio is called the sparsity ratio. The relevance of this problem stems from the fact that the isoperimetric number of a graph is related by a constant factor to its sparsity ratio [18]. Matula and Shahrokhi <ref> [23] </ref> proved that this problem is N P -complete in general graphs via a reduction from the M AXCU T problem. The computation of the bisection width of an n-vertex tree can be done in O (n 2 ) time using the techniques of Baker [5]. <p> Thus, Rao's algorithm is a 3/2-approximation algorithm for the isoperimetric number problem in planar graphs. The sparsest cut problem for trees was shown to be solvable in linear time by Matula and Shahrokhi <ref> [23] </ref>. They also gave an algorithm to solve the sparsest cut problem in triconnected outerplanar graphs. <p> Thus the following is worthy of further investigation; Problem : Can a faster algorithm for the isoperimetric number problem for solid grid graphs be devised using a technique similar to that of Papadimitriou and Sideri in [26]? Another interesting problem is the sparsest cut problem <ref> [23] </ref>. <p> Not surprisingly, SP RSST is also N P -complete by a reduction from the M AXCU T problem. This was proved by Matula and Shahrokhi <ref> [23] </ref>. A quick attempt to use the same reduction in order to prove the N P -completeness of SP RSST P reveals that the graph constructed in the reduction is quite nonplanar. <p> SP RSST when restricted to triconnected outerplanar graphs is polynomially solvable by an algorithm of Matula and Shahrokhi <ref> [23] </ref> in O (n 2 p log n) time for an n-vertex graph. They also give a linear time algorithm for computing the sparsity ratio of trees. There is another notion of partitioning of graphs called placement partitioning.

Reference-contexts: In the area of isoperimetric numbers of graphs, Mohar <ref> [24] </ref> proved that the subgraphs induced by an isoperimetric set of a graph G (the set of vertices achieving the minimum ratio mentioned above) and its complement are connected as induced subgraphs, provided G is itself connected. <p> He also gave eigenvalue arguments to obtain various upper and lower bounds on the isoperimetric number i (G) of a graph G. Mohar <ref> [24] </ref> further showed that for every n 1, i (G fi K 2n ) = minfi (G); ng where G has an even number of vertices. <p> has more than k vertices even when i (G) i (P k ) (it is already known that i (P k fi G) &lt; i (P k ) if i (G) &lt; i (P k ) since, in general, i (G fi H) minfi (G); i (H)g as mentioned in <ref> [24] </ref>). Azizoglu and Egecioglu [4] later obtained the isoperimetric number of a d-dimensional k-ary array as well as the cardinalities of its isoperimetric sets. It is worth noting that for most families studied (e.g. <p> They also conjectured that the bisection width problem for planar graphs (in fact a slightly more general version of it) is N P -complete. For the isoperimetric number problem, Mohar <ref> [24] </ref> gave a linear-time algorithm to compute the isoperimetric number of trees. The bisection algorithm for solid grid graphs by Papadimitriou and Sideri [26] mentioned above actually produces as a byproduct the minimum (k; n k) cuts thereby solving the isoperimetric number problem for this class of graphs as well. <p> Mohar also conjectured that the edge-isoperimetric number problem can be solved in polynomial-time for the class of planar graphs <ref> [24] </ref>. Later, Park and Phillips [27] gave an algorithm computing the isoperimetric number of a planar graph, though the details of this algorithm are incomplete. <p> An extremal set X of vertices in (1) achieving the minimum is called an isoperimetric set. Mohar <ref> [24] </ref> proved the important result that a connected graph has an isoperimetric set X where the subgraphs induced by X and X are both connected. <p> Our main focus in this section is the edge-isoperimetric properties of such highly structured graphs. There are several results related to the isoperimetric number of product graphs. Mohar <ref> [24] </ref> proved that i (G fi K 2n ) = minfi (G); ng where G is a graph with an even number of vertices, and also that i (P n fi P m ) = minfi (P n ); i (P m )g. <p> Eigenvalue arguments also fail to give a tight bound for i (A d k ). However it is true by eigenvalue arguments that in general minfi (G); i (H)g i (G fi H) cannot be too large <ref> [24] </ref>. Bollobas and Leader [8] proved the first lower bound for the edge-boundary of a subset of vertices in a d-dimensional k-ary array. In their proof, they consider the continuous analogue of this problem as well as "compression operators" which are the standard method in proving results of this nature. <p> Evidently i (P k ) i (G) for any connected k-vertex graph G. Thus the inequality i (P k fi G) i (P k ) is easy to prove since we always have i (G fi H) minfi (G); i (H)g <ref> [24, 4] </ref>. The reverse inequality i (P k fiG) i (P k ) is proved in [3] by a technique similar to the one used by Mohar in [24] for the proof of the i (G fi K 2n ) result. <p> The reverse inequality i (P k fiG) i (P k ) is proved in [3] by a technique similar to the one used by Mohar in <ref> [24] </ref> for the proof of the i (G fi K 2n ) result.

The case with even k was proved by Leighton [19] using a similar embedding method. We extended these techniques in [4] to give a tight lower bound for the isoperimetric number of arrays as follows. <p> There is an edge between two nodes if and only if k-ary representations of their labels differ in exactly one digit. It was previously shown by Nakano <ref> [25] </ref> that, for any given m, the subset of vertices with labels from 0 to m 1 has the minimum edge-boundary among all m-vertex subsets in a K d k . This is called the label ordering.
