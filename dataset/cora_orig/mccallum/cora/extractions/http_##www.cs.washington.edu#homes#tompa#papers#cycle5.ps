Reference-contexts: 1. Reflecting and Universal Traversal Sequences Universal traversal sequences were introduced by Cook (see Aleliunas et al. <ref> [2] </ref>) as a particularly simple method for traversing graphs. Universal traversal sequences are defined as follows. For 2 d &lt; n, let G (d; n) be the set of all connected, d-regular, n-vertex, edge-labeled, undirected graphs G = (V; E). For this definition, edges are labeled as follows.

Reference-contexts: To avoid trivialities, define U (d; n) = U (d; n + 1) in case G (d; n) is empty, which occurs exactly when both d and n are odd (see Borodin, Ruzzo, and Tompa <ref> [4, Proposition 1] </ref>). Good bounds on U (d; n) translate into good bounds on the time required by certain simple undirected graph traversal algorithms running in very limited space. <p> In particular, determining good lower bounds on U (d; n) is a prerequisite to proving time-space tradeoffs for traversing undirected graphs. (See Borodin, Ruzzo, and Tompa <ref> [4] </ref> for more detailed discussion.) Proving such lower bounds is the emphasis of this paper. The current best upper and lower bounds on U (d; n) are summarized in Table 1. (See Borodin, Ruzzo, and Tompa [4] for more background.)

This bound is improved in Corollary 9 to The value of d at which the second term begins to dominate is d = n log 10 2 n 0:3 . As in the previous work of Tompa [7], the method underlying the new lower bounds depends on analyzing traversals of "labeled chains". <p> In particular, Theorem 1 provides a lower bound on the length of universal traversal sequences on the cycle, and Theorem 2 provides a lower bound on the length of universal traversal sequences for higher degree graphs. Theorem 1 (Tompa <ref> [7, Corollary 7] </ref>): Let c and r be positive integers such that, for all positive integers t, R (t; c) rt. Then U (2; n) = (n log c r ). <p> Theorem 1 (Tompa [7, Corollary 7]): Let c and r be positive integers such that, for all positive integers t, R (t; c) rt. Then U (2; n) = (n log c r ). Theorem 2 (Tompa <ref> [7, Corollary 8] </ref>): Let c and r be positive integers such that, for all positive integers t, R (t; c) rt. <p> Theorem 2 (Tompa [7, Corollary 8]): Let c and r be positive integers such that, for all positive integers t, R (t; c) rt. Then for any integer 3 d n=17 + 1, By analyzing t-reflecting sequences for L (4), Tompa <ref> [7] </ref> demonstrated that R (t; 4) 6t, yielding the exponent log c r = log 4 6 1:29. He left open the analysis of t-reflecting sequences for chains of length five or greater. <p> This simple argument shows that R (2t 1; 5) 16t (8t base pairs, each with 2 symbols), or R (t; 5) 8t, but since log 5 8 is slightly less than log 4 6, there is no improvement over the result of Tompa <ref> [7] </ref> mentioned at the end of Section 1. This section will show that there must be at least 2t2 other pairs beginning at even indices, by considering the additional chains with labels 0011, 0110, 1001, and 1100.
