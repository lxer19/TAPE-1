Reference-contexts: He observed that if the magnitude of the coefficient at the coarse level is large than the expected value of magnitude of coefficient at the finer levels is linearly related to the magnitude of the coefficient at the coarse level.

Reference-contexts: It is found that image coding is highly dependant on the choice of wavelets. In the following paragraphs I will attempt to discuss the properties we should seek in a wavelet for image compression. For a more detailed discussion refer <ref> [6] </ref>. There are some fancy computationally intensive algorithms which choose optimal basis (in some sense) studing the statistical characteristics of the image to be coded. One can find literature under the heading of adaptive wavelet packets.

We can not apply DWT below level q, such that 2 q 2N . Here q = log (length of f k )= log (2) and N = length of the filters land h. Luckily, in case of images one rarely cross the lower limit on q. <p> Thus in this case we have constant bin widths. This bin width is computed adaptively for each subband and it depends upon the maximum and minimum coefficient magnitudes for that subband. For a detailed design of uniform scalar quantizer refer to <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> Generalized gaussian distribution is assumed when using Llyod Max quantizer to generate decision and reconstruction levels. Refer to <ref> [8] </ref> for a detailed implementations of Lloyd Max quantizer. 5 Entropy Coding After quantizing the coefficients, we need to pack them as efficiently as possible. It is done by entropy coding. Algorithms like Huffman Coding and Run-Length Coding are used for this purpose. <p> It is done by entropy coding. Algorithms like Huffman Coding and Run-Length Coding are used for this purpose. These are loss-less and the decoding process reconstructs the quantized subbands exactly. These are easy to implement for details refer to <ref> [8] </ref>. I have also implemented an entropy coder capable of huffman encoding different subbands and packing them in a file. 6 Current Trends in Image Coding Using Wavelet Transforms Once each subband is transformed the normal procedure is pack it as compactly possible.

Reference-contexts: Keep in mind that when you move in the realm of wavelet packet transform, you need to encode what wavelet basis and what tree structure you chose. This is an additional overhead. Refer to <ref> [10] </ref> for further details. 7 Conclusion It is obvious that wavelet transform coders can by used to achieve very high compression rates. It is also understandable that we should be careful in choosing the wavelet basis.
