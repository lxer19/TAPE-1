Abstract: This paper focuses on estimation for Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. The proposed methodology is based upon the use of importance link functions. With the help of appropriate importance sampling weights, consistent estimates of functionals are developed. The method works for reducible as well as irreducible Markov chains through the use of many-to-many importance link functions. Applications discussed include estimation of marginal genotypic probabilities for pedigree data and estimation for models with and without influential observations.

Email: snm@stat.mps.ohio-state.edu 1 this output, tabulation methods or more sophisticated methods, such as Rao-Blackwellization or importance-weighted marginal posterior density estimation <ref> (Chen 1994) </ref>, can be used to estimate features of interest of the posterior. In the standard presentation of these methods, an irreducible Markov chain is set up with limiting distribution equal to the posterior.

Reference-contexts: The focus is on obtaining a sample from the posterior and research largely concentrates on creating chains that move towards the posterior more quickly. Common algorithms that fall into this framework include the Gibbs sampler <ref> (Gelfand and Smith 1990) </ref> and Hastings' version of the Metropolis algorithms (Hastings 1970). Besag et al. (1995) comment on the common assumption of aperiodicity of the Markov chain, suggesting that moving toward periodicity can improve performance of the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Estimates for the case-deleted posteriors rely on importance sampling weights. Unfortunately, the variability in these weights sometimes results in estimates from the case-deleted posterior that have large or perhaps infinite variance! Standard importance sampling arguments <ref> (Geweke 1989) </ref> suggest that estimators for the case-deleted posterior would be improved by controlling the variability of the importance sampling weights. In fact, if one could sample from nk directly, the weights would have variance 0. <p> This comparison and those above demonstrate the effectiveness of the ILF method in reducing the variance of the importance sampling weights and consequently in improveing the estimators. Remark 4.5 The tail behavior of the importance sampling density is a major concern in Monte Carlo estimation <ref> (Geweke 1989) </ref>. ILF methods can be used to address this issue. Suppose, for example, that it is suspected that the tails of the importance sampling density ~ nk (s nk ) in Equation (11) decay too rapidly in the components. <p> In addition to consistency results, there are a number of central limit theorems available for McMC methods (discussion of Tierney 1994; Geyer 1992). These theorems can be adapted for the ILF estimators by combining the results for dependent sequences of variates with results for importance sampling estimators <ref> (see Geweke 1989) </ref>. One issue which arises in discussion of both central limit theorems and the effectiveness of McMC estimators is the rate of convergence (assuming ergodicity of the chain) of the distribution of X j to .
