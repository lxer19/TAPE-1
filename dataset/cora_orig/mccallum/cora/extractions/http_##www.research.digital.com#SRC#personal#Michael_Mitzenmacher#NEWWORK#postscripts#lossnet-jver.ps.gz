Abstract: In this paper we examine the theoretical limits on developing algorithms to find blocking probabilities in a general loss network. We demonstrate that exactly computing the blocking probabilities of a loss network is a #P-complete problem. We also show that a general algorithm for approximating the blocking probabilities is also intractable unless RP=NP, which seems unlikely according to current common notions in complexity theory. Given these results, we examine implications for designing practical algorithms for finding blocking probabilities in special cases.

Reference-contexts: (n) r = (n + e r ) (n r + 1); n; n + e r 2 S (C); where e r = (I [r 0 = r]; r 0 = 1; : : : ; R) is a unit vector corresponding to one call on route r (cf. <ref> [1] </ref>). The insensitivity of the distribution given in (1) to call duration distributions can be deduced from the work of Kelly [13] on general arrival rates to networks of quasi-reversible queues, or by direct application of results from the theory of generalized semi-Markov processes [2].

This model can be used naturally to model connections across a circuit-switched communication network, such as a telephone network system. The defining parameters of the system, however, are simply the matrix A, the capacity vector C, and the arrival rates r .

Reference-contexts: Similarly, a problem is #P-complete if it is in #P and any other problem in #P can be reduced to it in polynomial time. The extensions of most NP-complete problems to enumeration problems can be shown to be #P-complete using parsimonious transformations <ref> [5] </ref>. To show that Loss Partition is #P complete, we first show that it lies in #P. Theorem 1 Loss Partition is in #P. <p> C of finite sets and a positive integer K jCj: QUESTION: How many subcollections of at least K mutually disjoint sets does C contain? These problems can be shown to be NP-complete and #P-complete respectively by reducing to them one of several similar problems, including Independent Set and #Independent Set <ref> [5] </ref>. Notice that in a capacity one loss network, two routes must be disjoint in order for there to be a feasible configuration with a call on each route. Thus there seems to be an intuitive connection between loss networks and the Set Packing problem.
