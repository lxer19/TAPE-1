Reference-contexts: The problem of determining the complexity of the quaternion product is a special case of the problem of determining the complexity of a set of bilinear forms. A number of other special cases appear in the literature. For example, Strassen <ref> [1] </ref> shows that seven multiplications are sufficient for the product of 2 fi 2 matrices. Hopcroft and Kerr [2] and Winograd [3] show that seven multiplications are also necessary in the general and commutative cases, respectively. Fiduccia [4] mentions that ten multiplications are sufficient for the quaternion product. <p> The product of two quaternions can be viewed as the product of two such The Complexity of the Quaternion Product 12 complex matrices. From the result of Strassen <ref> [1] </ref>, this product can be performed in seven complex multiplications (in fact, six complex and one real multiplication). 3 The same construction yields an algorithm for multiplying quaternions over an arbitrary ring with seven complex multiplications, where a complex multiplication means the construction of (x 1 y 1 x 2 y

The purpose of this paper is to show that eight multiplications are necessary and sufficient for the quaternion product in the general case, and that at least seven multiplications are necessary in the commutative case. 2.

Reference-contexts: Let f k be the bilinear form represented by M k : f k = x t M k y for k = 1; :::; p. The following theorem is known [8], <ref> [9] </ref>. Theorem 1. <p> See Lafon <ref> [9] </ref> for a proof. Note that the choice N (z) = 0 M (z) is possible, hence the commutative complexity is not greater than the general complexity of a set of bilinear forms. 4.

Reference-contexts: It has recently come to the authors' attention that some of the results reported here have been previously obtained. The upper bound of section 4 appears in Dobkin <ref> [11] </ref>. The lower bound for the general case has been proven by de Groote [12].
