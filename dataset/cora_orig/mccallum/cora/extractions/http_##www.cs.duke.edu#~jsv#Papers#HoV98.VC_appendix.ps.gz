Abstract: The MPEG-2 Video Standard describes in detail a bitstream syntax and a decoder model but leaves many details of the encoding process unspecified, such as encoder bit rate control. The standard defines a hypothetical decoder model, called the Video Buffering Verifier (VBV), that can operate in either constant-bit-rate (CBR) or variable-bit-rate (VBR) modes. In this paper, we present a low-complexity algorithm for VBR rate control suitable for low-delay, real-time applications. The algorithm is motivated by recent results in lexicographic optimal bit allocation. The basic algorithm switches between constant-quality and constant-bit-rate modes based on changes in the fullness of the VBV buffer. We show how the algorithm can be applied either to produce a desired quality level or to meet a global bit budget. Simulation results show that the algorithm compares favorably to the optimal VBR algorithm.

Reference-contexts: With CBR, less difficult scenes would be coded at a higher quality than needed, therefore wasting bits. With VBR, the desired quality can often be delivered with no wasted bits. VBR encoding is also useful for multiplexing multiple video bitstreams over a common CBR channel <ref> [5] </ref>. Assuming that the instantaneous bit rates of the video sequences are statistically independent, more VBR bitstreams with a given peak rate R can be multiplexed onto the channel than CBR bitstreams coded at a constant rate of R.

CBR rate-control algorithms such as MPEG Test Model 5 (TM5) <ref> [6] </ref> process video in a single pass and is suitable for low-delay, real-time encoding. By using adaptive bit allocation and quantization techniques, the rate control is able to adjust to changing scene complexities.

Reference-contexts: Applications fitting this requirements include consumer digital video cameras, digital VCR, and video telephony. Specifically, we present a new low-complexity VBR rate control algorithm that is based upon recently published results on optimal bit allocation under a lexicographic minimax framework <ref> [7] </ref>. The framework assumes knowledge of the rate-distortion characteristics of every input picture and requires o*ine processing, where the rate-distortion characteristics are first measured and modeled before a global bit allocation can be computed. <p> With the new real-time rate control algorithm, we remove the need for o*ine processing while maintaining some of the advantages of the optimal algorithm. This paper is organized as follows. We begin by reviewing the lexicographic bit allocation framework of <ref> [7] </ref> in Section 2. Based on the optimal VBR bit allocation algorithm, we then describe our low-complexity algorithm for VBR rate control in Section 3. <p> The lexicographic criterion comes into play when buffering constraints do not admit the trivial constant-distortion allocation. Buffering constraints arising from the MPEG-2 VBV are derived and used in the analysis presented in <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> The instantaneous transmission rate for a picture is determined by the coded vbv delay parameter and the number of bits in the encoding of the picture. This mode is suited for modeling a channel with a variable delivery rate. Only the first mode is analyzed in <ref> [7] </ref>. We restrict our attention to this mode and note that this is the mode used by the DVD-Video Standard. <p> Furthermore, the quantization scheme is assumed to be perceptually-tuned to the Human Visual System, in that pictures coded with the same perceptually-adjusted nominal quantizer should be of the same visual quality. Analysis in <ref> [7] </ref> assumes rate-quantization models that are monotonic and independent, in that the rate-quantization model of one picture is independent of the coding of another. <p> This means that a segment coded at higher than the base quantization must empty the buffer at some point or terminate the sequence. This implies that such a segment uses the maximum 1 The version of this theorem found in <ref> [7] </ref> is incomplete.

We first outline the optimal VBR algorithm presented in <ref> [7] </ref> and then show how to modify this algorithm to work in a single pass. 3.1 Optimal Algorithm Below is an iterative algorithm for computing an optimal VBR allocation that uses a total of B T bits. 1.

As in [7], we use the TM5 adaptive quantization scheme to provide a mapping between nominal quantization and actual quantization scale. The nominal quantization scale is modulated by an activity factor that is computed from the spatial variance of the luminance blocks within a macroblock. <p> We report results here for the following four algorithms: 1) optimal lexicographic VBR, 2) TM5 CBR, 3) single-pass VBR without long-term rate control, and 4) single-pass VBR with long-term rate control. The simulation results for the lexicographic VBR algorithm are taken directly from <ref> [7] </ref>. To speed up the simulations of the other algorithms, we use approximate motion estimation. This results in a small decrease in the quality of the TM5 results presented here compared to those in [7]. <p> The simulation results for the lexicographic VBR algorithm are taken directly from <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In a sense, meeting a specified bit budget is a long-term process, whereas the basic VBR algorithm above can be viewed as a short-term process. This is similar to the approach taken in <ref> [13] </ref>. We propose to adapt an existing CBR rate control algorithm to perform the long-term rate control. For simplicity, we describe the process using the simple buffer-feedback rate control scheme used in TM5, where Q min is computed directly from the fullness of a virtual encoder buffer.
