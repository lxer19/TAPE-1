Reference-contexts: The larger the number of neighbors, the lower the correlation between a cells state and that of any given neighbor. In the limit of an number of dimensions there are no correlations, and the mean field theory is exact. Pursuing this idea, Chate and Manneville <ref> [1] </ref> examined a wide variety of CA in 4, 5, and higher dimensions. They found a number of rules showing non-fixed point limiting behavior. A typical example is shown in figure 3.

Reference-contexts: The mean field theory as just described is a crude approximation. It typically yields a picture of CA dynamics which is qualitatively correct, but quantitatively lacking. Improvement of the mean field theory requires taking into account those correlations neglected in the derivation of equation (4). A sequence of generalizations <ref> [2] </ref> of the mean field theory has been devised 5 in which correlations are represented in terms of the probability of blocks of length l. As order of approximation increases, so does the fidelity with which the generalized mean field theory represents the behavior of cellular automata.

Reference-contexts: At order 1, the parameters are the a i of equation (4), and for higher orders there are similar parameters. Further, for each set of parameter values, the set of corresponding rules can be constructed (see <ref> [3, 4] </ref> for a fuller discussion). Typically small changes in parameter values lead to small changes in the properties of the corresponding cellular automata. At certain distinguished values of the parameters, however, changes in behavior can be abrupt. <p> They showed that evolution toward the GKL rule was in no way evolution toward a critical region in the space of cellular automata. They went further to suggest that there may be no such critical region. One way out is explored in <ref> [3] </ref>. There it is argued that to find generic critical behavior one must use a general criterion for complexity in the genetic algorithm's fitness function. That a given rule exhibits critical behavior does not mean that all critical rules are closely similar to that particular rule.

Reference-contexts: To proceed further in this direction, some means must be found to limit consideration to subspaces containing the critical behavior. Work along these lines is in progress <ref> [5] </ref>. Evolutionary Approaches. Yet another way to explore the space of automata is to appeal to evolutionary algorithms to find cellular automata of interest. This path was first traversed by Packard [11]. He targeted a particular complex rule, called the GKL rule.

Reference-contexts: These are rules with random behavior. Near the lower left, by contrast, are a group of rules with low entropies, and high convergence time. These rules are complex. Parametric approaches One of the most well-known methods is that of Langton <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. Langton employs a parameter, which is a measure of the distribution of state transitions in the rule table. For CA with two states is particularly simple: it is the fraction of rule table containing neighborhoods which lead to a 1 under the rule.

Reference-contexts: In class III, by contrast, information is meaningfully transmitted only over short distances in space and time. Deterministic chaos injects noise at a significant rate, washing out all signal. Class IV automata form the intermediate case, not too hot, not too cold. Langton ([7], see also <ref> [8] </ref>) took a different approach to phenomenological classification. He measured two or more observables of CA behavior, entropy, mutual information, damage-spreading (Lyaponov) exponents, and the like. He found that the values of the various observables often served to separate rules into clusters with certain properties. <p> An advantage of is that it is easy to generate many rules with a given value of the parameter. Langton, followed by others (eg. <ref> [8] </ref>), varied through its range and studied the resulting behaviors. He found that for low values of simple rules, of Wolfram type I and II, were mostly generated. For high values the rules are typically chaotic, of Wolfram type III.

Reference-contexts: Packard reasoned that since GKL was complex on some initial configurations, then it must lie in a borderline region between simple and chaotic rules. Therefore, a genetic algorithm in which fitness was based on closeness to GKL should eventually produce rules close to this borderline. Mitchell, Crutchfield, and Hraber <ref> [9, 10] </ref> found fault in this reasoning. They showed that evolution toward the GKL rule was in no way evolution toward a critical region in the space of cellular automata. They went further to suggest that there may be no such critical region. One way out is explored in [3].

He targeted a particular complex rule, called the GKL rule. GKL performs a density classification task: If GKL is iterated on an initial configuration in which the density of 12 1's less than 1/2 then it will eventually converge to the all-0 configuration.

Reference-contexts: Better, from several points of view, is to use a more organic, co-evolutionary approach with an implicit fitness function. An example is the imitation game of Suzuki and Kaneko <ref> [12] </ref>. This game, inspired by the behavior of territorial birds, has been shown in the context of continuous dynamical systems to produce clear evolution toward complex behaviors.

Reference-contexts: Phenomenological approaches. As is well know, Wolfram <ref> [13] </ref> addressed the issue by dividing cellular automata into four broad, largely qualitative classes: I) all configurations map to a homogeneous state, II) all configurations map eventually to simple separated periodic structures, III) all configurations may to chaotic patterns, making large-time prediction of behavior impossible, though precise statistical statements may be

Reference-contexts: For rules with a small number of states there is a great deal of variability in the behavior or rules with a specified parameter value. It is only in the limit of an infinite number of states that the transition becomes sharp <ref> [14] </ref>. It is easy to see that the parameter is a special case of the mean field theory. Recall that p 1 t+1 = Bjt (B)!1 P B 2 jBj (the uniform probability) then p 1 t+1 = for all t.
