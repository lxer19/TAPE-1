Abstract: This paper outlines the possibilities, the evolution, and the basic technical elements of autonomously hovering micro robots. It consists of three parts. The first part presents the application Papa-TV-Bot, a free flying automatic video camera. The second part is a schedule for the long-term development of autonomously hovering mobots 1 in 8 phases. The third part describes the basic technolo gies of the vehicles of Phases 1 through 3.

Reference-contexts: First, it must be determined whether sensing linear displacement indeed is sufficient to keep a MAV in horizontal balance. However, given the relatively small size and low price of commercially available absolute position sensors on a radio 4 or ultrasonic basis (e.g., <ref> [13] </ref>), such a construction would be an elegant solution to the automatic hovering problem 5 . An additional heading sensor (magnetic compass) might be necessary for controlling the movements around the vertical axis 6 .

Reference-contexts: Tele-control is to be achieved using fuzzy control theory. Ultimately, our helicopter will incorporate voice-activated commands using natural language as 'Fly forward a little bit.' The idea is that a relatively inexperienced remote operator can use natural language voice commands rather than a couple of joysticks that may require <ref> [16] </ref> even use speech recognition to tilt the camera of their commercial aerial photography HiCam helicopter. months of training. These commands are naturally 'fuzzy' and hence fit into the fuzzy logic framework nicely [49].

Reference-contexts: Additionally, it must Avoid obstacles. If a human or nonhuman object obstructs the MAV during its filming missions, it must try to fly around it (e.g., <ref> [18] </ref>). Evade capture. Due to its purpose of approaching objects very closely and flying over crowds of people, it has to evade somebody trying to catch it. Be Safe. Because a Papa-TV-Bot is supposed to operate above people, it has to have extensive safety mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: It is a Micro Air Vehicle (MAV, [58,35]), a tiny, self-piloted flying machine, neither bird nor plane, but it's a little of both with some insect and robot characteristics thrown in [48]. Therefore, compared to todays R/C helicopters <ref> [25] </ref> it is smaller (diameter less than 10 inches), quieter (electro motors), safer (rotors hidden in the fuselage), andmost importantit can hover automatically. 2 Scenario Papa-TV-Bot How does the world look through the eyes of a humming bird?

This leads to short free flight performance times: commercially available electric model helicopters only fly for 5 to 15 minutes 8 <ref> [25] </ref>. Since the battery will be the heaviest part of an electric MAV, it is imperative to use the most efficient technology available, such as rechargeable solidstate or thin-film Lithium Ion batteries (Li+).

Because such a vehicle is supposed to stabilize itself automatically, the movements of the platform should only be controlled by high level spoken commands such as go up and turn left. These commands describe only relative movements.

Reference-contexts: These commands are naturally 'fuzzy' and hence fit into the fuzzy logic framework nicely <ref> [49] </ref>. Although the controlling concept is interesting, this helicopter cannot operate indoors; with its overall body length of 3.57m, it is far away from the size requirements of a MAV of Phase 3. For the same reasons, I suggest using outboard processing of language in Phase 3.
