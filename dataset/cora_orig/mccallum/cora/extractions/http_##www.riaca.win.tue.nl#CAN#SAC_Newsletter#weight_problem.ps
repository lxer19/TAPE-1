Title: Old mathematics and new technology: L'Hpitals weight problem and the TI-92  
Author: P. Drijvers, Freudenthal 
Address: Utrecht, The Netherlands.  
Affiliation: Institute  
Abstract-found: 0
Intro-found: 1
Reference: [1] <author> Van Maanen, J.A. </author> <year> (1991). </year> <title> L'Hpital's weight problem. </title> <booktitle> For the learning of mathematics, </booktitle> <volume> Vol 11(2), </volume> <pages> pp. 44 - 47. </pages>
Reference-contexts: It reflects a demonstration that was given at the ICME-8 conference in Seville, Spain, in July, 1996. The weight problem that is presented here has been described earlier by Van Maanen (see <ref> [1] </ref>). In the PROFI-project (a project on curriculum development at upper secondary level in the Netherlands, carried out by the Freudenthal Institute) this problem was given to students as a research task (see [3]).

Reference-contexts: It merely reflects a personal approach using the different TI-92 facilities. 2 The weight problem In 1696, Marquis de l'Hpital published his book Analyse des infiniment petits <ref> [2] </ref>. Most of the content of this book, however, was developed by Johann Bernoulli, L'Hpital's private teacher. A copy of the notes that Bernoulli prepared for his lessons to the Marquis (1691 - 1692) has been preserved.

In the PROFI-project (a project on curriculum development at upper secondary level in the Netherlands, carried out by the Freudenthal Institute) this problem was given to students as a research task (see <ref> [3] </ref>). These students, however, did not have access to TI-92 units, so the example as it is presented here is not based on classroom obser vations.

A copy of the notes that Bernoulli prepared for his lessons to the Marquis (1691 - 1692) has been preserved. It includes the weight problem (see <ref> [5] </ref>, p. 32 - 33), so Bernoulli is the originator of the problem, as he was the first to state L'Hpital's rule. By means of a contract, L'Hpital had the right to publish Bernoulli's mathematical discoveries. The weight problem is presented in Analyse des infiniment petits for a specific reason.
