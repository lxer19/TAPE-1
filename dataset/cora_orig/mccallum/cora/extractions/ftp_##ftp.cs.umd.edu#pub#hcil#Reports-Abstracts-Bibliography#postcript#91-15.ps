Abstract: We can renew American education by offering students the opportunity to develop skills, experiences, and values they need to become successful individuals, workers, family members, and societal contributors. They can have fun while learning and gain satisfaction from meaningful accomplishments. The Strategic Education Initiative is a five year, $100 Billion plan to help transform American education, provide powerful tools for teachers, promote advanced technology, and make schools more meaningful. Dynamic multimedia, novel user interfaces, powerful computing facilities, and international networks, can empower teachers and students in remarkable ways. These technologies can support teachers in fostering student engagement with peers and outsiders, and construction of projects that contribute to a better world. These approaches also promote each students self-worth while learning the subject material. I believe that as teacher effectiveness increases and learning becomes interactive, creation generates satisfaction, process and product become entwined, and cooperation builds community.

Reference-contexts: Construction of a high speed National Data Highway to permit remote computing, communication, collaboration, and image access is a viable goal, although it will certainly take more than five years to complete <ref> (Carlitz, 1991) </ref>. Allocation of $20 billion would get this project off to a fine start. The current High Performance Computing Initiative (Senate Bill 272, 102nd Congress) is a step in this direction, but it is likely to provide only about $1 billion.

Reference-contexts: More facts meant higher grades and was somehow better. This theme was suggested by the Cultural Literacy movement of Hirsch <ref> (Hirsch, Kett and Trefil, 1988) </ref>, who claimed that there were 5,000 key concepts that every informed citizen should master. While there are undoubtedly facts, phrases, and names that are important to learn, the emphasis seems wrong.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education presented by the American Association for Higher Education (Figure 3) pushed for cooperation among students and active learning projects. Multiple strategies for cooperative learning groups have been carefully developed and evaluated <ref> (Millis, 1990) </ref> and software to support cooperation has become a hot topic (Ellis et al., 1991). ______________________________________________ 1) Student Involvement - involving students in faculty research projects - encouraging internships - organizing small discussion groups - requiring in-class presentations and debates - developing simulations - creating opportunities for individual learning projects

Reference-contexts: Undoubtedly, the investment, impact, and ideas of the Strategic Education Initiative would lead to improving U.S. competitiveness internationally. At a time when the U.S. dominance of the computing industry is being vigorously challenged, these benefits to competitiveness could be helpful by stimulating user interface research and development <ref> (Shneiderman, 1987) </ref>. The draft budget in Figure 1 is a rough estimate that would have to be refined and detailed, but the - 2 essential notion is to provide schools with funds to acquire and apply hardware, networks, software, training, etc.

Reference-contexts: Further cuts in education programs and a failure to create compelling national goals in science and technology (the superconducting super-collider is too remote from most peoples concerns or comprehension) have contributed to the decline. Therefore I propose a bold national Strategic Education Initiative (SEI) <ref> (Shneiderman, 1989) </ref>, patterned on the concept of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) or the Strategic Computing Initiative (SCI). The SDI was quickly labelled the Star Wars Plan because of the space-based battle station imagery reminiscent of the George Lucas movies.

Reference-contexts: The goal would be to invigorate education in a dramatic way by spending $100 billion over a five year period. The impact would be to help teachers to empower students with a sense of their own capabilities in this emerging multimedia and networked world <ref> (Soloway, 1991) </ref>. If the SEI is effective, students would be prepared with necessary skills for work and for responsible membership in multiple communities.

Reference-contexts: While there are undoubtedly facts, phrases, and names that are important to learn, the emphasis seems wrong. This approach may have been suited to the industrial age of assembly line productivity, but in the third wave <ref> (Toffler, 1980, 1990) </ref> electronic age of the global village (McLuhan, 1966) a new vision seems necessary. Content is certainly important, standards are vital, but current educational approaches are failing.
