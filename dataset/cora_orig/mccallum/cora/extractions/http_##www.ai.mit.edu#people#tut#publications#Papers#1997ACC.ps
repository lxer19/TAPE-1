Abstract: In high-performance systems that require rapid and precise motion, time-optimal control techniques are regularly employed. Recently proposed techniques have demonstrated that these time-optimal commands can be derived for systems with complicated linear dynamics. When coupled with a strategy for verifying optimality, this derivation scheme can be guaranteed to yield only time-optimal results. This paper outlines a general method for deriving commands and then describes a detailed procedure for verifying their optimality. Experimental results reveal that this approach is both practical and effective. 1 . Introduction Many high-performance applications demand that machines execute rapid and precise point-to-point motions. In these situations, time-optimal control techniques are often enlisted to maximize the speed of system response. As an unfortunate side effect of these control strategies, system performance is often compromised by undesirable dynamics excited by rapid machine motions. Recently, new practical techniques have been proposed for deriving time-optimal commands that compensate for known linear system dynamics. The commands that result from this solution approach can produce time-optimal motions without exciting problematic system dynamics. Since this type of approach relies on the constrained optimization of a set of algebraic equations, the solutions are vulnerable to local minima and may not always be optimal. To address this issue, a straightforward verification procedure can be formulated, using the conditions postulated in Pontry-agin's Minimum Principle, to check the optimality of command profiles designed for linear systems. The purpose of this paper is to describe a general approach for creating verifiably time-optimal commands for linear systems. This approach consists of two steps. The first step is a strategy for deriving time-optimal commands for systems with any type of linear denominator dynamics. Originally proposed by Tuttle and Seering in [1], this solution strategy will be reviewed in section 3 for completeness. The second step of this two-part approach is a procedure for verifying that the commands resulting from the derivation scheme are time-optimal. Building on previous research, this procedure will be constructed and described in detail in section 4. In section 5 of this paper, both the derivation strategy and the verification scheme will be used to create time-optimal commands for an experimental testbed. From the results of this experimentation, it will be illustrated that the general approach outlined in this paper represents an effective and practical way for creating time-optimal commands for high-performance systems. 2 . Background For almost forty years, researchers have been investigating strategies for finding time-optimal commands. Much of this research has resulted from Pontryagin's original formulation and investigation of the time-optimal control problem [2]. In its basic form, the time-optimal control problem, as illustrated in figure 1, can be stated as follows: for a given system, what is the control input, u(t), that will transition the system output, y(t), from one rest state to another by a desired amount, dy, in the shortest possible time. Typically, the control input is assumed to be bounded such that u min &lt; u(t) &lt; u max , and, for the purposes of this paper, we will consider primarily linear systems, G(s). In his original presentation of the Minimum Principle, Pon-tryagin outlines a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that the time-optimal control of a linear system must satisfy. Stemming from these powerful insights, the Bang-Bang Principle [3] further postulates that any time-optimal control command, such as the one illustrated in figure 2, must always have a value that minimizes or maximizes the control input. Additionally, this time-optimal control command must contain only a finite number of times when the command profile switches between the maximum and minimum control limit. Since the amplitude of this command, then, is dictated by the given system actuator limits, the only unknowns that remain in the command profile are the number of the switch times and their exact values. This observation greatly simplifies the time-optimal control problem by reducing the solution space of possible command profiles to simply the set of possible switch times. This simplification allows for time-optimal controls to be found for some simple systems. However, for more complex systems, solutions algorithms for finding time-optimal controls using Pontryagin's principles typically prove to be numerical intensive and impractical [4, 5]. More recently, mostly due to work in the area of flexible structure control, new results have been presented for the time-optimal control of linear systems. In particular, researchers such as Singh, et al., [6] outline properties of time-optimal commands for systems with undamped flexible modes and note that they can be derived by solving a set of algebraic constraint equations. Following a similar approach, Liu and Wie [7] illustrate that time-optimal commands can be designed to be robust to system uncertainty. Ben-Asher, et al., [8] demonstrate similar success creating commands for a slewing flexible spacecraft, and also introduce a straightforward tech

Originally proposed by Tuttle and Seering in <ref> [1] </ref>, this solution strategy will be reviewed in section 3 for completeness. The second step of this two-part approach is a procedure for verifying that the commands resulting from the derivation scheme are time-optimal. Building on previous research, this procedure will be constructed and described in detail in section 4. <p> To address this problem, each author supplements the solution strategy with an optimality verification routine similar to the one suggested by Ben-Asher, et al., [8]. Most recently, Tuttle and Seering have proposed a new technique for deriving time-optimal commands for linear systems with any type of denominator dynamics <ref> [1] </ref>. Like previous methods, this technique provides a conceptually and numerically simple strategy for deriving bang-bang commands, but for a larger class of systems than possible to date. Furthermore, when coupled with an optimality verification scheme, this approach can guarantee that the derived bang-bang commands are also time-optimal. <p> This presentation will hopefully address the subject at a level of detail previously unavailable in the literature. 3 . The Solution Approach As a review of the work presented in Tuttle and Seering <ref> [1] </ref>, the solution approach for deriving time-optimal command profiles for single-input, single-output systems with any type of linear denominator dynamics is outlined in this section. <p> This optimization can be performed most efficiently if the problem constraints can be expressed algebraically in terms of the variables in equation (1). As outlined in Tuttle and Seering <ref> [1] </ref>, two types of algebraic constraints have been proposed to guide the search for time-optimal command solutions: (1) the dynamics cancellation constraints, and (2) the boundary condition constraints. The general equations for each of these cases will be presented be low. <p> The general equations for each of these cases will be presented be low. The dynamics cancellation constraints are a mathematical statement of fact that the time-optimal command must move the system from one point and bring it to rest at another. As described by Tuttle and Seering <ref> [1] </ref>, this is achieved when the impulse response of the command profile, u (t), is designed to have zeros at the locations of the system poles.
