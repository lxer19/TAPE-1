Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Following Adleman <ref> [1] </ref>, Lipton [7], and others, we recently proposed a new DNA computing scheme based on surface chemistry [8]. In this paper, we define an abstract model of surface-based DNA computation and describe the power and limitations of this model. <p> Hence, in the case of a mark followed by an append with no destroy operation intervening, sticky-end ligation can be used. append-unmarked (high-i, high-word, new-i, new word): This can be done using hybridization of a splint oligonucleotide followed by ligation, exactly as in Adle-man's experiment <ref> [1] </ref>. erase: This operation is implemented using a restriction enzyme which recognizes a short sequence of bases called a restriction site and cuts the strand at that site when the sequence is double-stranded.

Reference-contexts: To encode binary truth assignments for (up to 70) variables, Adleman and Lipton proposed that one-bit words be used, with 20 bases per word to identify the bit value and the variable (or word) index <ref> [2, 7] </ref>. The exact encoding of words was not specified. Each possible word can be synthesized using standard solid phase DNA synthesis in which a large quantity of a desired DNA molecule is built up nucleotide by nucleotide on a support particle in sequential coupling steps. <p> For example, a support with the nucleotide "A" attached may have the "A" reacted with a "C" to form a string of length 2 (known as a dimer), washed and the "C" coupled with "G" to form a string of length 3 (a trimer), and so on. Adleman <ref> [2] </ref> described how words can be concatenated together using a chemical process called ligation so that all 2 n n-bit strands can be created in n ligation steps.

Reference-contexts: The mark operation replaces the separate (or extract) operation of Adleman and Lipton, which divides strands into separate test tubes for further processing. The destroy-unmarked operation is very similar to an operation of Amos et al. <ref> [3] </ref> although their model is solution-based. There is no read-out operation in the above set. In this paper we ignore readout and focus on what sets can be recognized, as described in the next section.

Reference-contexts: Let Circuit-Size (t (n)) be the latter set. The constants in the O-notation in the following theorems are made explicit in the proofs. Theorem 1 Surface-Time (t (n)) = Circuit-Size (t (n)). This theorem is analogous to the theorem of Boneh et al. <ref> [4] </ref> that the Circuit SAT problem can be solved using a solution-based model of DNA computation. We are also interested in computations of languages when the append operation is not allowed. In this case, the erase operation is also unnecessary.

Reference-contexts: In our preliminary experiments on single-word strands [8], we use a glass surface and an attachment chemistry developed in the Smith laboratory <ref> [5] </ref> to attach oligonu-cleotides at the 5 0 end. The glass surface is modified with amino-reactive isothiocyanate functionalities in a multi-step process.

Reference-contexts: It must be chosen to have a recognition sequence not represented in the combinatorial word structure. For example the restriction enzyme Msp I recognizes the 4 base-pair sequence (5 0 )CCGG (3 0 ), when annealed to its complement (3 0 )GGCC (5 0 ) <ref> [6] </ref>. To ensure that the operation is performed correctly, an unmark operation can first be performed, then the restriction site can be made double-stranded on all strands via hybridization, followed by use of the restriction enzyme. 3 Proofs of Results Theorem 1 Circuit-Size (t (n)) = Surface-Time (t (n)).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Following Adleman [1], Lipton [7], and others, we recently proposed a new DNA computing scheme based on surface chemistry <ref> [8] </ref>. In this paper, we define an abstract model of surface-based DNA computation and describe the power and limitations of this model. In contrast with Adleman's solution-based experiment, surface-based DNA computations manipulate DNA strands that are immobilized on a surface using chemical linkers. <p> Preliminary work on implementing the mark and destroy operations on single-word strands is already underway <ref> [8] </ref>. 2.1 Set Initialization; Word Design A DNA strand, or oligonucleotide, can be thought of as a string over the alphabet (i.e. set of bases or nucleotides) fA; C; G; T g with chemically distinct ends known as the 3 0 and 5 0 ends. <p> Adleman [2] described how words can be concatenated together using a chemical process called ligation so that all 2 n n-bit strands can be created in n ligation steps. In our preliminary experimental work on an initial mul-tiset S = f0; 1g 5 <ref> [8] </ref>, we are using one base per bit, plus labels on either end. This can extended to multiple words as follows. <p> A good attachment chemistry ensures that the properly prepared oligonucleotides are immobilized to the surface at a high density, and that other oligonu-cleotides exposed to the surface later (for example during hybridization) do not bind non-specifically to the surface. In our preliminary experiments on single-word strands <ref> [8] </ref>, we use a glass surface and an attachment chemistry developed in the Smith laboratory [5] to attach oligonu-cleotides at the 5 0 end. The glass surface is modified with amino-reactive isothiocyanate functionalities in a multi-step process.

Reference-contexts: That is, the base "A" is added to the 3 0 hydroxyl of the duplex creating a one base overhang, or "sticky end". A cloning vector developed in the Smith laboratory some years ago exploited this non-templated adenylation activity to facilitate the cloning of PCR products (TA cloning <ref> [9] </ref>). Ligation to "sticky ends" (using a complementary one base T overhang on the word to be ligated to the surface-bound duplex) is substantially more efficient than blunt-end ligation.

Reference-contexts: If one base is used to encode one bit in a word then single-base mismatch discrimination is needed to properly mark words and this is challenging to do successfully. This is why it may be preferable to use more than one base per bit when encoding words. Mir <ref> [10] </ref> discusses this further. Multiple-word strands: In this case the method used for the single-word strands is combined with polymerase extension.

Reference-contexts: Third, the work of the company Affymetrix on DNA synthesis on "addressed" surfaces <ref> [11] </ref> can be viewed as a restricted form of computation. Our proposed DNA computing method is complementary to Affymetrix arrays in that the ability to address strands spatially is lost but the scale is much greater.
