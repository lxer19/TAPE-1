Abstract: We show that it is desirable to use data-specific or customized quantization tables for scaling the spatial frequency coefficients obtained using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). DCT is widely used for image and video compression [MP89, PM93] but applications typically use default quantization matrices. Using actual scientific data gathered from divers sources such as spacecrafts and electron-microscopes, we show that the default compression/quality tradeoffs can be significantly improved upon by using customized tables. We also show that significant improvements are possible for the standard test images Lena and Baboon. This work is part of an effort to develop a practical scheme for optimizing quantization matrices for any given image or video stream, under any given quality or compression constraints.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the table used may be scaled up or down by multiplying by a qscale on a per-macroblock basis. This scaling is done by heuristically determining regions of low activity and high activity and adjusting qscale accordingly (See, for example, <ref> [CP84] </ref>). The table used is generally the one suggested in the standard [MP89]. 3 Performance of customized quantization tables We used Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio as the measure of quality of a decompressed image.

Reference-contexts: Higher frequencies are quantized more coarsely (i.e. with a greater value of Q (u; v)) than lower frequencies. A good proportion of the high-frequency coefficients get quantized to zero. This enables the block to be compressed efficiently using entropy coding techniques such as Huffman coding or arithmetic coding <ref> [Jai89, PM93] </ref>. However, this compression is lossy as the reproduced values of the coefficients will not necessarily be the same as the original values. The quantization table Q ultimately determines the compression ratio and the quality of the reconstructed image. JPEG allows only a fixed table for the entire image.

JPEG allows only a fixed table for the entire image. Most encoders set this table to the table suggested in the standard <ref> [PM93] </ref>. For better quality, the entire table is scaled down while for higher compression, the entire table is scaled up by a small factor which is called the qscale. MPEG allows the quantization table to be changed along a video stream. <p> The default tables were obtained by multiplying the standard tables suggested by JPEG (for still images) and MPEG (for video streams) by a qscale in the range 1 8 31 8 , as is allowed under the two standards <ref> [MP89, PM93] </ref>. 24 28 32 36 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 PSNR (dB) Rate (bpp) Customized Default The range of the plots was chosen as 0::1 bpp. <p> The images are not reproduced here because of space constraints. 3.1 Performance results for Lena and Baboon Figures 1 and 2 show the results for the standard 512 fi 512 8-bit grayscale images Lena and Baboon, respectively. The default table used was that suggested by the JPEG standard <ref> [PM93] </ref>. The advantage of using customized tables is seen to be more at higher rates and better qualities. For example, for Lena, an improvement of about 0:5 dB in quality can be obtained at rate of 0:8 bpp.

Reference-contexts: F (0; 0) is the coefficient of the term with zero spatial frequency (the DC component) while F (7; 7) is the coefficient of the term with highest frequencies in the x and y directions. Details can be found in <ref> [RY90] </ref>. The advantage in using DCT is that it compacts most of the signal energy into the low frequency coefficients. The human eye is relatively insensitive to high spatial frequencies which can hence be ignored.
