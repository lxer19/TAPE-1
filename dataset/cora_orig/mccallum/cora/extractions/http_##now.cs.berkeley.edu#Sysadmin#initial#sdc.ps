Abstract: To perform single node tests, the administrator will select a set of nodes and a script of function to execute through a context-sensitive popup menu. The results of the test will be shown either through a popup window or by changing the area, fill or color of the nodes that are being tested. Tests involving the network are more complicated. As shown in Figure 1, we plan to let administrators specify network paths for testing. Some tests will also need the administrator to specify parameters like packet size in a dialog box. The administrator will know the status of the test by watching the thickness of the line. The results will be displayed in the same way as single node tests. The system is currently under development. We can read in and display the network and node map as shown in Figure 1. As the cursor moves across the screen, the information window displays the status of the nodes or links under the cursor. The icons can be moved around on the screen, and the attached lines follow the icons. We are currently retrieving information from remote nodes, and have simple functions which display this information, but we have not yet implemented aggregation. The user can control the node statistic display through a icon-specific popup menu. The primary remaining piece of work is integrating testing. We expect to have this working very soon. The most closely related work is TkIned [Sch93]. TkIned displays icons for each of the different nodes, and can display SNMP controlled stripcharts for values retrieved from those nodes. It does not handle aggregation of display information, or integrated node and network testing. We could have attempted to extend TkIned, but it is written in Tcl/Tk, making it more difficult to write code for structured types such as the Myri-net network map and graph traversals like breadth first search. Systems such as Sun Net Manager, HP Open View, and other network monitoring programs typically focus on network monitoring rather than host monitoring, and dont provide the aggregation functions that we want. In addition, these systems appear to be harder to extend and less portable than a solution based on Perl/ Tk. We have presented the design for a system diagnostic console that will scale to hundreds of nodes through aggressive use of aggregation. The diagnostic console integrates testing so that test results can be viewed alongside performance information. The system is implemented in Perl/Tk, which makes it portable, ex-ible and easy to modify.
