Title: The -calculus on trees and Rabin's complementation theorem  
Author: Andre Arnold 
Address: Universite Bordeaux I  
Affiliation: LaBRI  
Abstract: In this paper we show that the function associated with any closed or non closed term of the -calculus on trees can be represented by a recognizable set of trees whose nodes are labeled by letters and by sets of variables. Rabin's complementa tion theorem is an immediate consequence of this result.

By Niwinski's theorem <ref> [8] </ref>, for any recognizable set K of trees there is a closed -term t , not using the intersection operator, such that K = t T . By Proposition 8, K = ~t T , by Proposition 9, K = ~t F , and by Theorem 1, K is recognizable.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There is no need to recall the importance, in logic and computer science, of Rabin's complementation theorem <ref> [10] </ref>: for any tree automaton A there is a tree automaton A 0 such that L (A 0 ), the set of infinite trees accepted by A 0 , is the complement of L (A). <p> leads us to consider complete infinite trees whose nodes are labeled by a letter and a set of variables, called f-trees, because we use them as a concrete representation of functions over trees (such trees have been considered both by Muchnik [5], where variables are called "dead-ends", and by Rabin <ref> [10] </ref>). <p> Indeed this is almost exactly Lemmas 3.2 and 3.4 of Rabin <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> This characterization plays the role of Lemmas 3.10 and 3.11 in <ref> [10] </ref>. 5.1 The greatest fixed points Let F 2 F (X). <p> This does not increase the class of accepted sets of trees (cf. Theorem 3.1 of <ref> [10] </ref>). <p> To get that condition, add a new state q fl and the transition hq fl ; a; q 1 ; q 2 i for any transition hq; a; q 1 ; q 2 i 2 ffi where q is an initial state. It is well known (cf. <ref> [10] </ref>), and easy to prove, that the family Rec (A) of recognizable subsets of T (A) is closed under union and intersection. Let us consider a second alphabet A 0 and a mapping : A ! A 0 . <p> Lemma 1 If F is recognizable, then F -x and F x are recognizable. This lemma is nothing but Lemmas 3.2 and 3.4 of <ref> [10] </ref>. However, for completeness of this paper, we prove it in the last section of this paper. 6.3 The complementation theorem The complementation theorem is now easy.

Reference-contexts: In this case the Equivalence property is 8A; 9G : L (A) = L (G; I); and the Complementation property amounts to saying that for any game on any tree, one of the two players has a winning finite-state strategy (see also the survey of Thomas <ref> [11] </ref>). For Muller and Schupp [6], O is the class of alternating automata, which contains the usual automata, so that the Equivalence property is: for any alternating automaton B there is an automaton A such that L (B) = L (A).

Reference-contexts: Indeed this is almost exactly Lemmas 3.2 and 3.4 of Rabin [10]. Beyond their interest in the present proof of Rabin's complementation theorem, we believe that f-sets should be a useful tool to define recognizable functions over sets of trees in the way suggested by Thomas in <ref> [12] </ref> or to investigate the problem posed in [1] of whether or not the alternation-depth hierarchy of the -calculus with intersection is finite. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we recall some notions and notations about trees.
