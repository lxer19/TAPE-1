Abstract: Motivated by applications in computer graphics, visualization, and scientific computation, we study the computational complexity of the following problem: Given a set S of n points sampled from a bivariate function f (x; y) and an input parameter " &gt; 0, compute a piecewise-linear function (x; y) of minimum complexity (that is, a xy-monotone polyhedral surface, with a minimum number of vertices, edges, or faces) such that We prove that the decision version of this problem is NP-Hard . The main result of our paper is a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that computes a piecewise-linear surface of size O(K o log K o ), where K o is the complexity of an optimal surface satisfying the constraints of the problem. The technique developed in our paper is more general and applies to several other problems that deal with partitioning of points (or other objects) subject to certain geometric constraints. For instance, we get the same approximation bound for the following problem arising in machine learning: given n `red' and m `blue' points in the plane, find a minimum number of pairwise disjoint triangles such that each blue point j(x p ; y p ) z p j "; for all (x p ; y p ; z p ) 2 S:

Reference-contexts: Extending their work, Clarkson [7] has proposed an O (K o n 1+ffi ) expected time randomized algorithm for computing an approximation of size O (K o log K o ), where ffi can be an arbitrarily small positive number. Recently Bronnimann and Goodrich <ref> [5] </ref> have refined Clarkson's algorithm and have given a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an approximation of size O (K 0 ). In this paper, we study the approximation problem for surfaces that correspond to graphs of bivariate functions.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, R can be preprocessed in time O (n 2+ffi log O (1) n), for any ffi &gt; 0, into a triangle range-searching data structure, which can determine in O (log n) time whether a query trapezoid contains any point of R; see e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>. Our main purpose, however, is to only establish a polynomial time bound for the approximation algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Introduction 3 "-approximation of a convex polytope of n vertices in R 3 . Their algorithm produces an approximation of size O (K o log n), where K o is the size of an optimal "-approximation.

Roughly speaking, we can use the greedy set covering heuristic <ref> [7, 15] </ref>, ignoring the disjointness constraint, and then refine the heuristic output to produce disjoint trapezoids. Unfortunately, the last step can increase the complexity of the solution quite significantly. <p> We also proved that these problems are NP-Hard . The surface-approximation problem is an important problem in visualization and computer graphics. The state of theoretical knowledge on this problem appears to be rather slim. Except for the convex surfaces, no approximation algorithms with good performance guarantees are known <ref> [7, 17] </ref>. For the approximation of convex polytopes, it turns out that one does not need disjoint covering, and therefore the greedy set cover heuristic works. We conclude by mentioning some open problems.

Reference-contexts: This is an instance of the geometric set cover problem, with an additional disjointness constraint on the covering objects (triangles). Observe that the disjointness condition on covering objects precludes the well-known greedy method for set covering <ref> [12, 15] </ref>; in fact, we can show that a greedy solution has size (K o 2 ) in the worst-case. Let us now reformulate our surface-approximation problem as a constrained geometric partitioning problem. <p> We form the geometric set-system X = (P; f P " j 2 ffi & C () = 1 g) : X can be computed by testing each 2 ffi whether it is valid. We compute a set cover of X using the greedy algorithm <ref> [12, 15] </ref> in polynomial time. The greedy algorithm returns a set R consisting of O (K o log K o ) trapezoids, not necessarily disjoint. In order to produce a disjoint cover, we first compute the arrangement A (R) of the plane induced by R.
