Reference-contexts: Different models are developed and optimal control methods are used to design active, semiactive and passive suspensions. Finally in section 5, we enumerate the systembuild files and the mathscript files. 2 Powertrain Model Following definition of powertrain is used in the literature (eg. see <ref> [1] </ref>). A powertrain system includes an engine, a transmission (including a torque converter), a drivetrain (including rubber tires) and all other components that can influence the longitudinal dynamics of an automobile (such as throttle, fuel control, spark control, EGR system, clutches, brakes, accessories etc). <p> The torque converter pump torque T p acts as a load on the engine. We summerize the parameter values in the following table. The sources of these values are <ref> [2, 1] </ref> MAX 0.1843 Kg/s V e 0.0027 m 3 c T 498636 N m /(Kg/s) 5:48 t st ! e s M a 28.84 g/mole R 8314.3 J/Kg mole deg K 2.2 Automatic Transmission A detailed model of automatic transmission (including dynamic modeling of clutches and bands) is developed by <p> The following table summarizes the values of various parameters used in this demo.

The limited slip mechanism of the differential, the unequal lengths of the axle shaft, the geometric changes of suspension and the engine vibration can alter the drive train dynamics but are not modeled to keep the model simple. <p> We assume the front to rear brake distribution to be 60-40. i.e. 60 percent of the brake force is applied to front wheel and 40 percent to rear wheel. 6 The brake torque dynamics is modeled by a simple first order time lag as in <ref> [1] </ref>: t b _ T b + T b = ff max where ff b = Brake Pedal Deflection t b = Time constant associated with maximum brake torque F max = Maximum brake torque resulting from front wheel locking up = W (l + h ( + f r )) <p> In such cases, one of the modifications of the standard sliding mode technique is to define synthetic inputs (see <ref> [1, 11] </ref>). Let us define ! wf as a synthetic input at this step.

Reference-contexts: TC = Normalized Throttle Characteristic as a function of the throttle angle ff. Usually T C (ff) will be determined by an experiment and a data table will be used in the simulation. We use a curve fit obtained in <ref> [2] </ref> TC = 1 cos (1:14459 ff 1:06) for ff 79:46 PRI = Normalized Pressure Influence function as a function of manifold to atmospheric pres sure ratio. Similar to TC, we use a curve fit from [2]; PRI = 1 exp (9 ( P atm The intake manifold pressure P m <p> We use a curve fit obtained in <ref> [2] </ref> TC = 1 cos (1:14459 ff 1:06) for ff 79:46 PRI = Normalized Pressure Influence function as a function of manifold to atmospheric pres sure ratio. Similar to TC, we use a curve fit from [2]; PRI = 1 exp (9 ( P atm The intake manifold pressure P m and m a are related by ideal gas law, m a = R T m The flow of air from intake manifold to combustion chamber is given by _m ao = c 1 vol m a <p> The volumetric efficiency vol represents the effectiveness of engine's induction process. It is a complex function of engine geometry and many engine parameters. It is normally modeled by experimental data. We use the empirical formula given in <ref> [2] </ref>. vol = (24:5! e 3:10 fi 10 4 )m 2 Thus the air flow rate into intake manifold (and subsequently into combustion chamber) is controlled by throttle. <p> AFI = Normalized air fuel ratio influence function. We use the following curve fit relation from <ref> [2] </ref> AFI = cos (7:3834 (A=F 13:5)) 2 The AF ratio is a tuning parameter and can be set by the designer. Once set, its value is fixed throughout the simulation 6 where, A=F is the actual air fuel ratio of the mixture in combustion chamber. <p> With the simplifying assumptions stated above, it will be given by A=F = _m fi SI = Normalized spark influence function. We use the following curve fit relation from <ref> [2] </ref> SI = (cos (SA MBT)) 2:875 where SA is tuning parameter representing the spark advance from Top Dead Center and MBT represents the minimum spark advance from TDC for best torque. c T represents the maximum torque production capacity of an engine for AFI = 1 and SI = 1. <p> The engine friction torque is curve fitted from experimental data <ref> [2] </ref> as T f = 0:1056 ! e + 15:10 The accessory torque T a is used to test the effect of various accessories on engine performance. <p> The torque converter pump torque T p acts as a load on the engine. We summerize the parameter values in the following table. The sources of these values are <ref> [2, 1] </ref> MAX 0.1843 Kg/s V e 0.0027 m 3 c T 498636 N m /(Kg/s) 5:48 t st ! e s M a 28.84 g/mole R 8314.3 J/Kg mole deg K 2.2 Automatic Transmission A detailed model of automatic transmission (including dynamic modeling of clutches and bands) is developed by <p> V e 0.0027 m 3 c T 498636 N m /(Kg/s) 5:48 t st ! e s M a 28.84 g/mole R 8314.3 J/Kg mole deg K 2.2 Automatic Transmission A detailed model of automatic transmission (including dynamic modeling of clutches and bands) is developed by Cho and Hedrick in <ref> [2] </ref>. A typical automatic transmission consists of two parts: * Torque Converter: A torque converter is used as a fluid coupling device between engine and the gear box. <p> The 7 detailed operational principle (including a dynamic model) can be found in [5]. We use a static model which is a quadratic fit for an input output experiment from <ref> [2] </ref>.

The same technique can be used to model all gear shifts. For the sake of simplicity, clutches are not modeled dynamically in this work. We use the following kinematic relationships to model the transmission mechanicals. <p> The following table summarizes the values of various parameters used in this demo. The values are obtained from <ref> [2, 1] </ref>.

The limited slip mechanism of the differential, the unequal lengths of the axle shaft, the geometric changes of suspension and the engine vibration can alter the drive train dynamics but are not modeled to keep the model simple. <p> For control purposes, we can use experimental data (as in <ref> [2] </ref>) to derive force-slip relationship. At relatively low tire slip rate (15 - 20 percent), tire force increases linearly with slip. As slip increases, the relationship becomes nonlinear. The peak tire force is generated around 20 percent slip and then the force decreases as the slip increases. <p> The automobile speed V is the variable to be controlled. The values of various parameters are given in the following table: 4 Some authors define two expressions for slip, one while driving and one while braking so that the slip is always positive <ref> [2] </ref>. In that case, we have to change the equations (14,15) explicitly when the car switches between driving and braking mode.

It was subsequently refined and used for different studies in ([2],[4],[1]). <p> We design a sliding mode controller for speed control of the powertrain model. It should be noted that the most challenging part of this design is the engine rpm control. This is evident from the amount of papers devoted to this area of research (See e.g. <ref> [3, 7, 8, 9] </ref>). In our case, with simple models of clutches and tires, the relationship from engine rpm ! e to vehicle speed V is mostly kinematic and hence easy to invert. Therefore, we have a separate engine control demo along with the speed control of the powertrain.

As slip increases, the relationship becomes nonlinear.

Reference-contexts: The following is a simple introduction to sliding mode control method (for details refer to <ref> [10] </ref>) Consider the following single input dynamical system x (n) = f (x) + b (x)u (22) where x is the output of interest, u is the control and x = h i T is the state vector. <p> High frequency chattering is undesirable as it needs large bandwidth actuators and reduces the life of the components. To avoid high frequency chattering, one might alter the equation (26) to make the desired _s follow the equation, _s = Ks (28) 8 Refer to <ref> [10] </ref> for the proof of this claim 13 With this choice, the Lyapunov proof is still valid and the control is a linear function of s. If s (0) is large, then this design needs enormous control effort.

We use a well known theorem (see <ref> [17] </ref>), which converts this problem to an equivalent but simpler problem. <p> Because of this hard constraint, the design problem does not fit into standard LQG optimal control framework. Various methods have been suggested for the design of semiactive suspensions in the literature. (see <ref> [17] </ref> for details) Typically semiactive control law is realized by a variable damper (figure 5). The damping coefficient v of the variable damper can take values in the set [0; v max ]. <p> It is shown in <ref> [17] </ref> that under certain assumptions, this policy is optimal. * Calculate the optimal active force as before. Let f s denote the force that can be gener ated by the semiactive damper.

It is straighforward to include rms ride comfort measure in optimal control framework. A trivial solution to satisfy this criterion will be to produce constant suspension force equal to sprung weight which will result in zero acceleration.

Reference-contexts: Hence we assume that the valve can instantaneously achieve any commanded position x v . By following the steps outlined below, a model of this actuator can be built. (for details of modeling refer to <ref> [23] </ref>). * Apply continuity equation to relate pressure dynamics inside actuator chamber to fluid flow. We have to take into account the leakage across piston from one chamber to the other as well as external leakage. * The fluid flow into the chambers is governed by the valve.
