Title: A Abstract syntax Normative Annex A.1 Introduction The abstract syntax is central to the definition
Date: August 1995  September 1995  September 1995 109  
Note: Notes on this section of the Z Standard Section title: Abstract syntax Note: Updated in preparation for version 1.2. Section editor: John Nicholls Source file: absyn.tex Most recent update: 11th  Formatted: 14th  A.2  Version 1.2 14th  
Abstract: There are many possible ways of constructing an abstract syntax for Z, and the choice of the form given below is a matter of judgement, taking into account the somewhat conflicting aims of simplicty and economy of semantic definition, and the maintenance of a clear relationship with the concrete representation. The syntax is presented as a set of production rules in which each entity is defined in terms of its constituent parts. For each of the entities defined in the abstract syntax, there is a subsection in the main part of the standard defining its representation and meaning.

Reference-contexts: The basis for the Interchange Format is the ISO Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). SGML permits the structure of texts to be represented and encoded in a standard form, convenient for storage, editing, retrieval and processing. The SGML Standard is defined in <ref> [13] </ref>. A general description of the aims and principles of SGML, together with an annotated version of the standard, is included in The SGML Handbook by C. F. Goldfarb [10]. Case studies and applications in SGML are described in the work of the Text Encoding Initiative reported in [23]. <p> E.3 Introduction to SGML This section provides an introduction to SGML, sufficient for the understanding of the definition of the Interchange Format in Section E.4.

Many of the entity names used in the tables have already been defined as standard in Appendix D of <ref> [13] </ref>. In order to encode names which consist of more than one entity reference, or of a mixture of entity references and normal text, "mixed name" elements must be employed.
