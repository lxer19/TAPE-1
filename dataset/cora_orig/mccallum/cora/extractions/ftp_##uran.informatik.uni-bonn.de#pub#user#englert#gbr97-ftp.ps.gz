Abstract: An approach for the recognition of polymorphic patterns by subgraph isomorphism computation of parameterized graphs will be presented. Parameterized graphs (short: p-graphs) are extensions of undirected graphs by parameter vectors at the nodes and edges. We will define p-graphs and basic concepts of subgraph isomor-phism computation for p-graphs. A bottom-up algorithm for p-subgraph isomorphism computation according to a given search graph and a template graph will be described. Since the enumeration of all induced p-subgraphs require tremendous effort, we will propose four pruning mechanisms in order to reduce the size of the search space. The computed subisomorphisms provide useful background knowledge for 3D building reconstruction in order to alleviate the occurring ambiguities, namely occlusions, inverse mapping, and noise. Using an extensive suburban scene it will be shown how polymorphic patterns can be recognized. Finally, we will estimate and discuss an upper bound complexity of the algorithm according to the application.

Reference-contexts: Many of the search graphs represent complex building cluster which contain nested or closely interlocking buildings and which comprise detailed information of the roof structure. The task is to compute relevant building models for photogrammetric building reconstruction <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A large variety of 3D building models has been extracted. Thus the computed building models require a generalization in order to be more compact. Therefore we investigate the application of Machine Learning approaches as shown in <ref> [3] </ref>. Furthermore, the computational cost of the admissible extension are huge, and hence raising the central question whether there is a structure of the search space which can be further exploited.

Reference-contexts: Obviously, this improvement can be generalized for partitions consisting of more than two parts, e.g. a circle of length three, which reduces cost significantly. 4 Application: Polymorphic Pattern Computation of 3D Building Surfaces Our application is based on a three-dimensionally modeled suburban area consisting of 1846 building cluster <ref> [5] </ref> from which the polyhedral surfaces were computed and represented as p-graphs forming search graphs. The nodes contain as information their degree and the edges contain as information their gradient, their length, and knowledge about the existence of an adjacent, horizontal, orthogonal edge.

Reference-contexts: In order to alleviate the search space exploration we will provide so-called pruning mechanisms, which allow to cut off ambiguous solutions as early as they are recognized. For reasons of clearness the pruning mechanisms Shrinking set, Symmetrical Solutions, and Look ahead which are described in <ref> [6] </ref> have been left out. Often template graphs have mirror symmetrical properties (cf. Figure 4), which enable one to apply also the following pruning mechanism P-Symmetric Partition: a mirror symmetrical template graph can be partitioned into two equal, induced p-subgraphs. <p> Then the estimated upper bound of ffi (V 0 ) improves the upper bound estimation jP jV T j j jP 1 j (jV T j 1)!

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The recognition and classification of polymorphic patterns for scene analysis is an important endeavor [2]. In this paper an approach for recognizing polymorphic patterns by subgraph isomorphism computation of parameterized graphs will be presented. Although algorithms for isomorphism computation of planar graphs with polynomial cost exist, e.g. <ref> [10] </ref>, subgraph isomorphism computation requires an enumeration and matching of all subgraphs, and is hence exponential in time. We will provide an approach which uses geometrical and topological information at the nodes and edges, so-called parameter vectors, and thus can speed-up subgraph isomorphism computation.
