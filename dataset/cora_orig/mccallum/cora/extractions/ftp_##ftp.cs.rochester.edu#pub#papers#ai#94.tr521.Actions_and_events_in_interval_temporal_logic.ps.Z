Abstract: We present a representation of events and action based on interval temporal logic that is significantly more expressive and more natural than most previous AI approaches. The representation is motivated by work in natural language semantics and discourse, temporal logic, and AI planning and plan recognition. The formal basis of the representation is presented in detail, from the axiomatization of time periods to the relationship between actions and events and their effects. The power of the representation is illustrated by applying it to the axiomatization and solution of several standard problems from the AI literature on action and change. An approach to the frame problem based on explanation closure is shown to be both powerful and natural when combined with our representational framework. We also discuss features of the logic that are beyond the scope of many traditional representations, and describe our approach to difficult problems such as external events and simultaneous actions.

Reference-contexts: There are several characteristics of propositions that allow them to be broadly classified based on their inferential properties. These distinctions were originally proposed by Vendler [1967], and variants have been proposed under various names throughout linguistics, philosophy, and artificial intelligence ever since (e.g., <ref> [Mourelatos, 1978; Allen, 1984; Dowty, 1986; Shoham, 1988] </ref>). For the most part we will not be concerned with all the distinctions considered by these authors. However one important property mentioned previously is homogeneity. <p> These differences have been discussed in detail elsewhere (e.g., <ref> [van Benthem, 1983; Allen, 1984; Shoham, 1988] </ref>). 4 Reasoning about Action in Simple Domains This section discusses prediction in theories of action, in particular the frame problem, and describes our approach based on explanation closure.

Reference-contexts: This is because the two sets of axioms represent two very different sources of knowledge. The first defines knowledge about what the world is necessarily like whenever the event occurs successfully, while the second defines the abilities of the agent in causing 2 In previous work (e.g., <ref> [Allen, 1991] </ref>), we included the event "caused" by attempting the action as an argument to the T ry predicate. The problem with this is that we might want to categorize the "caused" event in several ways (i.e., using several event predicates). 18 events.

Reference-contexts: Natural language work, on the other hand, typically only deals with commonsense entailments from statements about actions and events, sometimes with a focus on plan recognition and explanation (e.g., <ref> [Allen, 1994; Hobbs et al., 1993; Schubert and Hwang, 1989] </ref>). Our representation is intended to serve as a uniform representation to support all these tasks. As a result, we try to avoid introducing any specific syntactic constructs that support only one reasoning task.

Reference-contexts: We start by describing the basic temporal structure to be used in the logic, namely the interval representation of time developed by Allen [1983; 1984] and discussed in detail in <ref> [Allen and Hayes, 1989] </ref>. We then describe the temporal logic used to represent knowledge of properties, 7 - (1) - - - (2) m - i j - (4) j - - - - (5) k l k i j m events, and actions. <p> This functional notation is justified because we can prove that the result of j + k is unique <ref> [Allen and Hayes, 1989] </ref>. Next, periods uniquely define an equivalence class of periods that meet them. <p> In particular, moments are true periods and may meet other periods, and if M eets (i; m) ^ M eets (m; j) for any moment m, then i is before j. Points, on the other hand, are not periods and cannot meet periods. Full details can be found in <ref> [Allen and Hayes, 1989] </ref>. Any semantic model that allows these distinctions would be a possible model of time. In particular, a discrete time model can be given for this logic, where periods map to pairs of integers hI; Ji where I &lt; J.

Reference-contexts: Axioms like this can be very useful in defining simple planning systems similar to non-linear planners (e.g., <ref> [Allen and Koomen, 1983] </ref>). 6.2 Synergistic Effects It is also easy to define additional synergistic effects that occur when two actions occur simultaneously. For instance, you can define events that occur only when several actions are performed simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: We prefer to use a more complex domain than that of the YTS to illustrate these cases.

The goal of the project is to build an intelligent planning assistant that is conversationally proficient in natural language. The domain involves several cities connected by rail links, warehouses and factories at various cities, and engines, boxcars, etc.., to transport goods between them.

Reference-contexts: Most of the previous work on these problems tends to address only a subset of these problems. The STRIPS-based planners (e.g., TWEAK [Chapman, 1987], SIPE [Wilkins, 1988], SNLP [McAllester and Rosenblitt, 1991]), for instance, only address the planning problem, while work in the situation calculus (e.g., <ref> [McCarthy and Hayes, 1969; Baker, 1991] </ref>) has primarily focussed on the prediction problem or on using it as an abstract theory for planning (e.g., [Green, 1969]). <p> The second issue is what mechanism is used to make the assumptions. There are two main approaches here: explicitly adding axioms that encode the assumptions (e.g., [Green, 1969; Schubert, 1990]) or using a nonmonotonic model theory that defines a new notion of entailment that includes the assumptions (e.g., <ref> [McCarthy, 1980; Shoham, 1988; Baker, 1991; Sandewall, 1994] </ref>). Of course, the work on circumscription shows that model-theoretic techniques always have an equivalent axiomatic formulation, although it may require going beyond standard first-order logic. This equivalence suggests that there is really a continuum of approaches here. Everyone must make assumptions.

Reference-contexts: The question is whether Fred is dead or not, or rather whether an axiomatization of the problem in some logical system allows the conclusion that Fred is dead to be derived. This simple problem has generated an extensive body of literature (cf. <ref> [Brown, 1987] </ref>).

The same prediction model underlies the formalisms based on non-linear planning as in TWEAK <ref> [Chapman, 1987] </ref> and SNLP [McAllester and Rosenblitt, 1991] and systems based on these techniques. The additional complication is that actions are partially ordered, and so systems must distinguish between predictions that are necessarily true (in any allowable action ordering) or only possibly true (in some allowable action orderings).

Reference-contexts: Thus the gun must have initially been loaded, i.e., Loaded (t0). 2 We see that the temporal logic is immune to the "direction" of the proof with respect to the direction of time, as expected. In contrast, most other models allow temporal prediction only in a forward direction (e.g., <ref> [Dean and McDermott, 1987] </ref>) and must use a completely different approach for "persisting" backwards in time. Interestingly, the proof for the SMM does not use the fact that we tried to shoot (AX3).

Reference-contexts: These issues have been studied extensively in work on the semantics of natural language sentences.

Reference-contexts: In this way, the situation calculus defines a point-based branching time model. A duration function on actions can be defined that allows one to compute the time of the resulting situation given the initial situation <ref> [Gelfond et al., 1991] </ref>. Within the constructive models, however, the range of temporal reasoning that can be performed is severely limited. First, note that there are no situations defined during the time an action is executing. This means that you cannot assert anything about the world during an action execution. <p> The situation calculus shows more promise with the introduction of action composition operators. For instance, given two actions a 1 and a 2 , then the action a 1 + a 2 is the action of performing the two simultaneously (e.g., <ref> [Gelfond et al., 1991; Schubert, 1990] </ref>). Explicit axioms can then be given for these complex actions, and mechanisms can be introduced to automatically derive such axioms from the individual actions if they are independent of each other (e.g., [Lin and Shoham, 1992]). <p> Pelavin [1991] contains an extensive analysis of the problems that arise in general with simultaneous interacting actions. Some work has explored the possibility of allowing a duration for each action <ref> [Gelfond et al., 1991] </ref>. Then the duration of a sequence of actions would simply be the sum of the individual action durations. But there is little point to doing this unless one allows these extended actions to overlap with other actions and external events.

Reference-contexts: Other approaches work instead by minimizing event or action occurrences. Properties are assumed to change only as a result of events defined in the representation, and logically unnecessary events do not occur (e.g., <ref> [Georgeff, 1986b; Georgeff, 1986a; Morgenstern and Stein, 1988] </ref>). These approaches show more promise at handling more complex situations and have many similarities to our work. 23 The approach we take, however, retains the flavor of explicit frame axioms.

Reference-contexts: (e.g., TWEAK [Chapman, 1987], SIPE [Wilkins, 1988], SNLP [McAllester and Rosenblitt, 1991]), for instance, only address the planning problem, while work in the situation calculus (e.g., [McCarthy and Hayes, 1969; Baker, 1991]) has primarily focussed on the prediction problem or on using it as an abstract theory for planning (e.g., <ref> [Green, 1969] </ref>). Natural language work, on the other hand, typically only deals with commonsense entailments from statements about actions and events, sometimes with a focus on plan recognition and explanation (e.g., [Allen, 1994; Hobbs et al., 1993; Schubert and Hwang, 1989]). <p> In addition, as we show in the subsequent sections, this approach naturally handles a wide range of more complex problems.

The other major approach focuses on minimizing property change, with additional constraints based on the temporal ordering of properties (e.g., <ref> [Shoham, 1988; Kautz, 1986] </ref>) or minimizing causal relationships (e.g., [Lifschitz, 1987]). Sandewall [1994] examines the advantages and limitations of each of these approaches in detail.

Reference-contexts: With this addition, the new prediction model validates the proposed search strategies. Similar methods using the event calculus are proposed in <ref> [Eshghi, 1988; Shanahan, 1989; Kowalski, 1992] </ref>. 4.2 Frame Axioms and Explanation Closure The problem with the above approach is that the STRIPS assumptions do not hold in most realistic situations that one needs to reason about. <p> Work on the frame problem investigates methods of making assumptions about the world to predict the likely consequences of actions. There are therefore two separable issues to consider, which have been called the "epistemological" and "computational" aspects of the problem (cf. <ref> [Kowalski, 1992] </ref>, but also [McCarthy and Hayes, 1969] regarding epistemological and heuristic adequacy). The epistemological aspect concerns what assumptions one makes about the world, while the computational aspect concerns how to compute and use these assumptions in the formalism.

Reference-contexts: The resulting formalism is again closer to what we propose, and we question the advantage of retaining the original situation calculus framework. The event calculus <ref> [Kowalski and Sergot, 1986] </ref> has an explicit notion of event that corresponds more closely to our notion of events. This is not surprising as both this formalism and our own development of the temporal logic are based on intuitions about the close relationship between time and events.

Reference-contexts: A similar model built out of pairs of real numbers does not allow moments. A more complex model can be specified out of the reals, however, that does allow continuous time, or models that are sometimes discrete and sometimes continuous are possible.

Reference-contexts: There are several ways to try to overcome this problem. Many researchers abandon frame axioms altogether, and have built models that use persistence or inertia assumptions (e.g., <ref> [Lifschitz, 1987; Shoham, 1988] </ref>). These approaches assume that all changes caused by an action are specified, and every property not asserted to change does not change. <p> Rather, the representation only makes sense when these assumptions are made. The other major approach focuses on minimizing property change, with additional constraints based on the temporal ordering of properties (e.g., [Shoham, 1988; Kautz, 1986]) or minimizing causal relationships (e.g., <ref> [Lifschitz, 1987] </ref>). Sandewall [1994] examines the advantages and limitations of each of these approaches in detail. Most of the approaches that minimize property change cannot handle Sandewall's test suite of problems, let alone be extended to handle external events and simultaneous actions.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the constructive situation calculus has the same problem|since there is no way to express information about what the state of the world is while the action is happening, there is no mechanism for allowing an event to occur while an action is being performed. Lifschitz and Rabinov <ref> [Lifschitz and Rabinov, 1989] </ref> present a limited mechanism to handle this by allowing "miracles" to occur while an action is performed to explain why its effects are not as expected.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the axioms above say nothing about what would happen if the agent simultaneously lifts a small block and a large block. This reflects the fact that the agent doesn't know. With a technique based on predicate minimization (such as <ref> [Lin and Shoham, 1992] </ref>), the agent would assume that it would not tip over, possibly a dangerous assumption. We would instead use explanation closure techniques on the Ab predicate which allow us to leave such cases uncertain. <p> Explicit axioms can then be given for these complex actions, and mechanisms can be introduced to automatically derive such axioms from the individual actions if they are independent of each other (e.g., <ref> [Lin and Shoham, 1992] </ref>). If the actions are not independent of each other, some reasonable solutions can be found and, as long as actions are instantaneous, it appears that the theory can remain constructive.

Reference-contexts: This is another motivation for favoring the explanation closure technique. It makes the assumptions that are made explicit, and thus potentially available for probabilistic analysis.

Reference-contexts: Most of the previous work on these problems tends to address only a subset of these problems. The STRIPS-based planners (e.g., TWEAK [Chapman, 1987], SIPE [Wilkins, 1988], SNLP <ref> [McAllester and Rosenblitt, 1991] </ref>), for instance, only address the planning problem, while work in the situation calculus (e.g., [McCarthy and Hayes, 1969; Baker, 1991]) has primarily focussed on the prediction problem or on using it as an abstract theory for planning (e.g., [Green, 1969]). <p> By exploiting this property, the plan can be constructed in this backward fashion, and once a plan is found, it is guaranteed to achieve the goal given the two assumptions above. The same prediction model underlies the formalisms based on non-linear planning as in TWEAK [Chapman, 1987] and SNLP <ref> [McAllester and Rosenblitt, 1991] </ref> and systems based on these techniques. The additional complication is that actions are partially ordered, and so systems must distinguish between predictions that are necessarily true (in any allowable action ordering) or only possibly true (in some allowable action orderings).

Reference-contexts: The second issue is what mechanism is used to make the assumptions. There are two main approaches here: explicitly adding axioms that encode the assumptions (e.g., [Green, 1969; Schubert, 1990]) or using a nonmonotonic model theory that defines a new notion of entailment that includes the assumptions (e.g., <ref> [McCarthy, 1980; Shoham, 1988; Baker, 1991; Sandewall, 1994] </ref>). Of course, the work on circumscription shows that model-theoretic techniques always have an equivalent axiomatic formulation, although it may require going beyond standard first-order logic. This equivalence suggests that there is really a continuum of approaches here. Everyone must make assumptions. <p> In any event, a formalization at this level seems more more plausible than a solution that solves this problem by reasoning about force equations, which would require much more detailed knowledge of the domain. We could also use something like McCarthy's Ab predicate <ref> [McCarthy, 1980] </ref> in ETRY1, which would allow us to incrementally add conditions that entail an abnormal lifting attempt. However, if we used a standard nonmonotonic method to minimize Ab, we would risk losing information about cases where the robot is uncertain.

Thus, performing an action will be described in terms of running a program. 2.2 The Situation Calculus The situation calculus means different things to different researchers. In its original formulation <ref> [McCarthy and Hayes, 1969] </ref>, which we will call the general theory of the situation calculus, situations are introduced into the ontology as a complete snapshot of the universe at some instant in time. In effect, the situation calculus is a point-based temporal logic with a branching time model. <p> Rather the properties of the resulting state must be specified axiomatically, and the frame problem involves how best to specify these properties. The original proposal for the situation calculus <ref> [McCarthy and Hayes, 1969] </ref> was to use frame axioms, which explicitly stated which properties are not changed by the actions. Explicit frame axioms have come under criticism, primarily because there are too many of them, both to write down explicitly and to reason with efficiently. <p> Work on the frame problem investigates methods of making assumptions about the world to predict the likely consequences of actions. There are therefore two separable issues to consider, which have been called the "epistemological" and "computational" aspects of the problem (cf. [Kowalski, 1992], but also <ref> [McCarthy and Hayes, 1969] </ref> regarding epistemological and heuristic adequacy). The epistemological aspect concerns what assumptions one makes about the world, while the computational aspect concerns how to compute and use these assumptions in the formalism.

Reference-contexts: This does not seem workable, and recent attempts to represent the actual events generally abandon the constructive approach, and have to introduce an explicit new construct for events (e.g., <ref> [Miller and Shanahan, 1994] </ref>). The resulting formalism is again closer to what we propose, and we question the advantage of retaining the original situation calculus framework. The event calculus [Kowalski and Sergot, 1986] has an explicit notion of event that corresponds more closely to our notion of events. <p> With this, one can introduce an Occurs predicate that asserts that a particular action occurs at a specific time and that is defined by an axiom that quantifies over all situations at that time (e.g., <ref> [Pinto, 1994; Miller and Shanahan, 1994] </ref>). This development moves the formalism closer to what we are proposing. Ultimately, the main difference between our approach and these extended situation calculus representations with explicit time will probably be one of approach.

Reference-contexts: Other approaches work instead by minimizing event or action occurrences. Properties are assumed to change only as a result of events defined in the representation, and logically unnecessary events do not occur (e.g., <ref> [Georgeff, 1986b; Georgeff, 1986a; Morgenstern and Stein, 1988] </ref>). These approaches show more promise at handling more complex situations and have many similarities to our work. 23 The approach we take, however, retains the flavor of explicit frame axioms.

Reference-contexts: These issues have been studied extensively in work on the semantics of natural language sentences. While there are many proposals, everyone agrees on a few basic distinctions (e.g., <ref> [Vendler, 1967; Mourelatos, 1978; Dowty, 1986] </ref>). <p> There are several characteristics of propositions that allow them to be broadly classified based on their inferential properties. These distinctions were originally proposed by Vendler [1967], and variants have been proposed under various names throughout linguistics, philosophy, and artificial intelligence ever since (e.g., <ref> [Mourelatos, 1978; Allen, 1984; Dowty, 1986; Shoham, 1988] </ref>). For the most part we will not be concerned with all the distinctions considered by these authors. However one important property mentioned previously is homogeneity.

Reference-contexts: In fact, most planning algorithms exploit a specific prediction model in order to suggest actions likely to produce a good plan, but all systems are based on some prediction model. As a concrete example, consider the standard backward chaining planning algorithm using the STRIPS representation (e.g., <ref> [Nilsson, 1980] </ref>). The algorithm chains backwards from the goal state. First, the goal state is compared to the initial state and a set of propositions that differ in truth value between the two states are found.

Reference-contexts: It may be true that we could characterize all interactions between simultaneous actions in terms of events in this way. Ultimately, however, this would require reducing everything to events characterizing physical force equations. In fact, this is what is suggested in many papers addressing simultaneous action (e.g., <ref> [Pednault, 1986] </ref>). We do not believe this is appropriate for a commonsense theory of action, as it requires agents to understand the physics of the world at a fairly deep level in order to understand simple everyday interactions. <p> As mentioned earlier, STRIPS-based systems (e.g., [Tate, 1977; Vere, 1983; Wilkins, 1988]) only allow simultaneity when the actions are independent. A few others (e.g., <ref> [Pednault, 1986] </ref>) allow for synergistic effects cast in terms of domain constraints on states (e.g., in any state s, if the left side of the piano is lifted, and the right side is lifted, then the piano is lifted).

Reference-contexts: As a result, he can define notions such as a successful action attempt, and explicitly reason about an agent's actions and what events they will cause. His representation of time has many similarities to the work that extends the situation calculus with a time line <ref> [Pinto, 1994] </ref>, and he explores the consequences of adding explicit time to such a model in depth. 21 A significant difference between our approaches is that we use an interval-based logic, while McDermott uses a continuous point-based model. <p> With this, one can introduce an Occurs predicate that asserts that a particular action occurs at a specific time and that is defined by an axiom that quantifies over all situations at that time (e.g., <ref> [Pinto, 1994; Miller and Shanahan, 1994] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: axioms can often be derived from the action definition (ETRY) and event generation (EGEN) axioms. 4.3 Examples By way of illustrating the application of the logic and the explanation closure technique, we now present formalizations of some of the standard problems from the literature on reasoning about action gathered in <ref> [Sandewall, 1994] </ref>. These are mostly variants of the Yale Shooting Problem [Hanks and McDermott, 1986], a basic AI test case for reasoning about action. <p> This would allow one to shoot things that are already dead, for example. In the remainder of this section, we use these axioms for several of the core problems of the Sandewall test suite <ref> [Sandewall, 1994] </ref>. Each of these problems deals with prediction from a given situation, sometimes predicting previous facts (retrodicting). For each problem, we provide an axiomatization of the problem description and a proof (or proof sketch) of the conclusion. <p> The second issue is what mechanism is used to make the assumptions. There are two main approaches here: explicitly adding axioms that encode the assumptions (e.g., [Green, 1969; Schubert, 1990]) or using a nonmonotonic model theory that defines a new notion of entailment that includes the assumptions (e.g., <ref> [McCarthy, 1980; Shoham, 1988; Baker, 1991; Sandewall, 1994] </ref>). Of course, the work on circumscription shows that model-theoretic techniques always have an equivalent axiomatic formulation, although it may require going beyond standard first-order logic. This equivalence suggests that there is really a continuum of approaches here. Everyone must make assumptions.

Reference-contexts: In proving this, the situation is constructed by action composition, and thus the desired sequence of actions (the plan) 4 can be extracted from the proof. As others have pointed out (e.g., <ref> [Schubert, 1990] </ref>), most of the criticisms about the expressibility of the situation calculus concern the constructive form of it rather than the general theory. Our position is that the constructive situation calculus is a limited representation, especially in dealing with temporally complex actions and external events. <p> In addition, as we show in the subsequent sections, this approach naturally handles a wide range of more complex problems. The second issue is what mechanism is used to make the assumptions. There are two main approaches here: explicitly adding axioms that encode the assumptions (e.g., <ref> [Green, 1969; Schubert, 1990] </ref>) or using a nonmonotonic model theory that defines a new notion of entailment that includes the assumptions (e.g., [McCarthy, 1980; Shoham, 1988; Baker, 1991; Sandewall, 1994]). <p> The situation calculus shows more promise with the introduction of action composition operators. For instance, given two actions a 1 and a 2 , then the action a 1 + a 2 is the action of performing the two simultaneously (e.g., <ref> [Gelfond et al., 1991; Schubert, 1990] </ref>). Explicit axioms can then be given for these complex actions, and mechanisms can be introduced to automatically derive such axioms from the individual actions if they are independent of each other (e.g., [Lin and Shoham, 1992]).

Reference-contexts: Natural language work, on the other hand, typically only deals with commonsense entailments from statements about actions and events, sometimes with a focus on plan recognition and explanation (e.g., <ref> [Allen, 1994; Hobbs et al., 1993; Schubert and Hwang, 1989] </ref>). Our representation is intended to serve as a uniform representation to support all these tasks. As a result, we try to avoid introducing any specific syntactic constructs that support only one reasoning task.

Similar methods using the event calculus are proposed in <ref> [Eshghi, 1988; Shanahan, 1989; Kowalski, 1992] </ref>. 4.2 Frame Axioms and Explanation Closure The problem with the above approach is that the STRIPS assumptions do not hold in most realistic situations that one needs to reason about.

Reference-contexts: Of course, if one abandons the requirement of a constructive theory, then more complicated scenarios can be represented. In fact, in some approaches (e.g., <ref> [Shanahan, 1990] </ref>) even continuous change has been represented. The primary mechanism that enables this, however, is the exploitation of the mapping from situations to times, and the introduction of situations that are not the result of any actions.

Reference-contexts: There are several characteristics of propositions that allow them to be broadly classified based on their inferential properties. These distinctions were originally proposed by Vendler [1967], and variants have been proposed under various names throughout linguistics, philosophy, and artificial intelligence ever since (e.g., <ref> [Mourelatos, 1978; Allen, 1984; Dowty, 1986; Shoham, 1988] </ref>). For the most part we will not be concerned with all the distinctions considered by these authors. However one important property mentioned previously is homogeneity. <p> These differences have been discussed in detail elsewhere (e.g., <ref> [van Benthem, 1983; Allen, 1984; Shoham, 1988] </ref>). 4 Reasoning about Action in Simple Domains This section discusses prediction in theories of action, in particular the frame problem, and describes our approach based on explanation closure. <p> There are several ways to try to overcome this problem. Many researchers abandon frame axioms altogether, and have built models that use persistence or inertia assumptions (e.g., <ref> [Lifschitz, 1987; Shoham, 1988] </ref>). These approaches assume that all changes caused by an action are specified, and every property not asserted to change does not change. <p> Rather, the representation only makes sense when these assumptions are made. The other major approach focuses on minimizing property change, with additional constraints based on the temporal ordering of properties (e.g., <ref> [Shoham, 1988; Kautz, 1986] </ref>) or minimizing causal relationships (e.g., [Lifschitz, 1987]). Sandewall [1994] examines the advantages and limitations of each of these approaches in detail. <p> The second issue is what mechanism is used to make the assumptions. There are two main approaches here: explicitly adding axioms that encode the assumptions (e.g., [Green, 1969; Schubert, 1990]) or using a nonmonotonic model theory that defines a new notion of entailment that includes the assumptions (e.g., <ref> [McCarthy, 1980; Shoham, 1988; Baker, 1991; Sandewall, 1994] </ref>). Of course, the work on circumscription shows that model-theoretic techniques always have an equivalent axiomatic formulation, although it may require going beyond standard first-order logic. This equivalence suggests that there is really a continuum of approaches here. Everyone must make assumptions.

Reference-contexts: Thus, to capture all this information in a single framework, the engine running should be formalized by an event. 6.4 Discussion For the most part, treatments of simultaneous actions in the literature are limited. As mentioned earlier, STRIPS-based systems (e.g., <ref> [Tate, 1977; Vere, 1983; Wilkins, 1988] </ref>) only allow simultaneity when the actions are independent.
