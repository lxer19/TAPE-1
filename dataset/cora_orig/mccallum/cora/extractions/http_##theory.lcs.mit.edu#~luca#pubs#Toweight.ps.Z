Abstract: We investigate the approximability properties of several weighted problems, by comparing them with the respective unweighted problems. For an appropriate (and very general) definition of niceness, we show that if a nice weighted problem is hard to approximate within r, then its polynomially bounded weighted version is hard to approximate within r o(1). Then we turn our attention to specific problems, and we show that the unweighted versions of Min Vertex Cover, Min Sat, Max Cut, Max Directed Cut, Max 2Sat, and Max Exact kSat are exactly as hard to approximate as their weighted versions. We note in passing that Min Vertex Cover is exactly as hard to approximate as Min Sat. In order to prove the reductions for Max 2Sat, Max Cut, Max Directed Cut, and Max E3Sat we introduce the new notion of "mixing" set and we give an explicit construction of such sets. These reductions give new non-approximability results for these problems.

Reference-contexts: Our results can be extended to any Max kCSP problem whose instances do not contain unary constraints, such as the d-Regular Hypergraph Trasversal studied by Alimonti and by Kann, Lager-gren and Panconesi <ref> [1, 24] </ref> and the Max k Cut (also known as Max k-Colorable Subgraph) studied by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [28] and by Kann, Khanna, Lagergren and Panconesi [23]. We believe that our reduction can be extended to the general Max Sat problem.

Reference-contexts: For the sake of completeness we sketch the proof: consider the random cut where each vertex u is chosen independently and with probability p u . The expected measure of such a cut is clearly equal to P Using the method of conditional probabilities (see e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>), a cut with measure not smaller than this expectation is constructible in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: The goal of an optimization problem is, given an instance x, to find an optimum solution y, that is, a solution whose measure is maximum or minimum depending on whether the problem is a maximization or a minimization one (for a formal definition of NP optimization problems see <ref> [10] </ref>). In the following opt will denote the function that maps an instance x into the measure of an optimum solution. Let A be an optimization problem.

In order to obtain the first 2-approximate algorithm for the weighted version, instead, a linear programming formulation of the problem has been used [27].
