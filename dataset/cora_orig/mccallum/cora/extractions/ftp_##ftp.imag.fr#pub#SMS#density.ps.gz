Title: MULTIRESOLUTION ANALYSES AND WAVELETS FOR DENSITY ESTIMATION  
Author: ANESTIS ANTONIADIS AND REN E CARMONA 
Date: July 5, 1991  
Abstract: We use the concept of multiresolution analysis and orthonormal basis of wavelet functions to construct an estimator for an unknown density in a given Sobolev's space. We show consistency with the rate of convergence equal to the optimal minimax rate of convergence. We also discuss some of the features of this new method of estimation on a numerical example.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we consider a method of density estimation based on "wavelet expansions". Consistancy and mean square rates are obtained for densities in Sobolev spaces. The rates obtained are sharp in the sense that they attein the best possible convergence rates established by Bretagnolle and Huber <ref> [2] </ref> and Wahba [17]. It seems that the use of multiresolution analyses and wavelet bases will eventually be added to the tools used in (nonparametric) statistics. This phenomenon may occur faster than we might have thought.

Reference-contexts: Many methods for the estimation of the unknown density f have been proposed and used over the years. They include the kernel methods (Rozenblatt [14], Parzen [13].

Reference-contexts: Note that the value k (j) = 1 is a possibility which should be considered. Indeed, the above summations involve only flnitely many terms when the function ' has compact support, and multiresolution analyses with compactly supported scaling functions are known to exist (see <ref> [4] </ref>). We shall use them in the numerical treatement of the examples discussed in the last section.

Multiresolution Analyses The approach we follow in the present work is in the same spirit. Fortunately it has greater exibility in the sense that an appropriate choice of the analyzing wavelet can be used to alleviate the drawbacks of the traditional methods.

Reference-contexts: Discussion and Possible Extensions The above estimator is obtained by a `sieve-like" method (see Grenander <ref> [7] </ref>). The approximation of a function of L 2 (IR) at the resolution j is given by the projection P j f of f onto V j .

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately we do not know how to estimate the integers j n from the data in an objective manner to approximately minimize some optimality criterion.

When the analyzing wavelets are compactly supported, the resulting variational problem, which should be inflnite dimensional a priori, is shown to be actually flnite dimensional and the problem reduces to solving a huge linear system. The multiple smoothing algorithm of Gu and Wahba <ref> [9] </ref>, with its corresponding driver in the Rkpack minipackage ([8]) gives us a way to obtain such an estimate.

The interested reader is referred to [12] for other results of this type. <p> The details of f , locally characterize the regularity of f . If the functions ' and are appropriately chosen, they can be viewed as band fllters and the detail of f at a given resolution corresponds then to a particular frequency band of f (see <ref> [11] </ref>) . From the above discussion, one can see that the estimator which we obtained works with the local structure of the data in the sense that it is essentially a superposition of kernel-like estimators with difierent bandwidths.

Reference-contexts: Moreover the cross validation computations take time and, without any special optimization, the wavelet computations were faster. After this work was completed we learned about the method of log-spline density estimation as presented in <ref> [23] </ref>. They used exponential of 5-knot cubic splines to develop point estimates for densities, the number of knots and their position being selected by minimizing an estimate of a loss function.
