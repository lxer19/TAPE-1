Note: 7  version is also available. The Maisie language compiler and simulation environment has been  1000. MVPe has been successfully ported, without modification, to each of these platforms. By the time of this publication, it is expected that MVPe will be available as part of the standard Maisie distribution, which is located at ftp.cs.ucla.edu. Additional information about availability can be found on the MVPe web page at http://may.cs.ucla.edu/projects/mvpe/ or  [2] J. Misra. Distributed discrete-event simulation.

Abstract: MVPe provides a system for visually describing simulations in a variety of application domains. The visual interface simplifies topology layout and allows rapid reconfiguration of programs. In the future, we are planning to enhance the environment in several ways. We are hoping to add a generic run-time animation API which can be reconfigured for particular application domains. We are working to integrate the Pablo Performance Analysis Environment[6] instrumentation primitives into the code generator, in order to incorporate Pablo's performance analysis animation. The interface to MVPe is currently quite spartan, intended to quickly provide the full simulation power of Maisie. The interface is constantly undergoing upgrades in usability as well as functionality. In addition, an interactive hypertext user's manual is nearly complete and should be fully integrated with the Maisie documentation by the time of this publication. Although MVPe currently supports only Maisie, our eventual aim is to abstract out the code-generation unit to allow compatibility with other library based simulators/simulation languages. [3] R.E.
