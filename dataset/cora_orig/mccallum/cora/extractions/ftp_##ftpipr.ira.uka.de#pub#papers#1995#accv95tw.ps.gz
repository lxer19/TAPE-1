Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for the segmentation of 3D datasets which especially occur in medical imaging. A combined split and merge segmentation is used to extract homogeneous regions out off the original image. During this automatic segmentation process an octree is build up and the resulting regions are saved in an octree like structure. This method can deal with large data volumes due to the fact that a compressible data structure is used.

Reference-contexts: Even with the "individuality" of the nodes, the rate of compression is sufficiently large. Even this good rate of compression could be extended using linear octrees <ref> [1] </ref>. This data structure only stores the black nodes of an octree and therefore reduces the required space corresponding to the information stored in the image. Each node is stored by its "code" in an array and could be reached directly.

Reference-contexts: The neighbourhood of a region consists of the six direct neighbours (see Fig. 1). This arrangement was chosen because using only the direct neighbours avoid a breakout through small borders during the merge-process. 2.4 Optimization The merge-process can be optimized using a merge-index <ref> [2] </ref>. This index is a measure of correspondence between two regions.

Reference-contexts: the algorithm we take a closer look at the data structures used because they build the main foundation for our method and understanding them makes it easier to understand the whole process. 2.1 Data structures A well known method of data compression in computer graphics is the use of octrees <ref> [3] </ref>. This hierarchical data structure is based on a recursive subdivision of a cube. The subdivision determines whether the subcube has satisfied a homogeneous criterion or has reached the maximal resolution. Therefore octrees allow a condensed storage of 3D images and are mainly used in computer graphics and robotics.
