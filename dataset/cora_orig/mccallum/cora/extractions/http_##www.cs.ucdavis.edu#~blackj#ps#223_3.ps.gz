Abstract: We analyze a matrix-multiplication algorithm (program 5.7, page 202) when running on an n 2 -processor CREW PRAM. Reading or writing memory takes time t local and an add-and-multiply takes time t c . Since this is linear in n, the processor-time-product is fi(n 3 ). Whether this is cost-optimal depends on which sequential algorithm we employ: using the analogous matrix multiplying algorithm (which is fi(n 3 )) the above algorithm is cost-optimal. However since better algorithms do exist for the serial case (such as Strassen's algorithm with its asymtotic complexity of about fi(n 2:8 )) then strictly speaking our algorithm is not cost-optimal.
