Reference-contexts: Past researchers have tried to model biped locomotion using methods like Lagrangian or Newton-Euler mechanics. The resulting dynamic equations for the models were usually of high order and needed to be simplified by some assumptions before a control technique could be applied. For example, <ref> [Furusho and Masubuchi, 1986] </ref> derived the full equations of motion for a five-link planar biped and then linearized them around the vertical equilibrium and partitioned the linearized state equations into dominant and fast modes. <p> c2 c1 1 2 If we assume that during the single support phase, the ankle of the swing leg is fixed and there is no actuation at the ankle of the stance leg, the dynamic equations for the biped during the single support phase is similar to those derived in <ref> [Furusho and Masubuchi, 1986] </ref> for a five-link planar biped. An equivalent computer model (as shown in Figure 2 ) was created and it has approximately the same configuration and mass distribution as Spring Flamingo. The parameters of this model are tabulated in Table 1 and Table 2.

Reference-contexts: These capabilities of the biped could be attributed mainly to the extensive design of the feet. <ref> [Kajita and Tani, 1995] </ref> used a scheme called Linear Inverted Pendulum Mode to control a biped walking on rough terrain. They developed a simple control method for the biped by ignoring the mass of the legs. They assumed that the biped knew the profile of the ground in advance. <p> This is different from [Kajita and Tani, 1991] approach in which the body height of the biped was fixed regardless of the slope gradient. Virtual Model Control (VMC) approach results in a motion similar to the Linear Inverted Pendulum mode described in <ref> [Kajita and Tani, 1995] </ref>. In the latter, a linear trajectory (or constraint line) was formed based on the projected foothold position of the swing leg. <p> If the biped had massless legs, the VMC using the virtual components described in Section 3.3 would also generate a linear trajectory in cartesian space. In the VMC, the resulting equations for controlling the biped are even simpler than those used in <ref> [Kajita and Tani, 1995] </ref> but we need to use some intuition in the former case. Nonetheless, both approaches have shown that we do not need to have a complex control algorithm in order to control a biped to walk dynamically on level or sloped ground. <p> We are also looking at the usage of the ankle torque to assist the walking. For example, it can be used to control the horizontal velocity to a limited extent <ref> [Kajita and Tani, 1995] </ref>. Besides using the ankle, there are also a few other means of controlling the horizontal velocity. We should try to find out which of them are effective and under which conditions they are effective.

Reference-contexts: The dynamics of the fast modes were ignored and proportional plus derivative feedbacks were applied at individual joints to track prescribed angular displacement profiles. The trajectory tracking was carried out in the joint space. <ref> [Kajita and Tani, 1991] </ref> studied a planar biped which was modelled as a massive body with two massless legs. The biped was controlled to walk in a mode called Linear Inverted Pendulum. A control methodology called Virtual Model Control (VMC) [Pratt, 1995] was recently developed for legged robots. <p> We also observed the horizontal hip velocity, just after the touch down of the swing leg, was a fraction of the velocity just before the touch down.

Virtual Model Control (VMC) approach results in a motion similar to the Linear Inverted Pendulum mode described in [Kajita and Tani, 1995].

Reference-contexts: The specification for the horizontal walking velocity is always fuzzy. For example, we think in terms of fast, medium, slow motion etc.. It has been shown that a planar biped can walk passively down a gentle slope without any actuators <ref> [McGeer, 1990] </ref>. In this thesis, we specify the desired height and velocity of the torso, while keeping it in an upright position. However, the height and horizontal velocity are allowed to vary within a tolerable range.

Reference-contexts: By changing the maintained pitch angle of the torso, the projection of the overall bipeds center of gravity can be shifted. When ascending a slope, the natural reaction for a human is to lean forward. When descending a slope, he naturally leans back as depicted by the photographs in <ref> [Muybridge, 1989] </ref>. However, to simplify matters, the desired pitch angle of the torso is set at zero degree in this thesis regardless of the slope gradient. ii) Desired horizontal velocity at the hip, v xd In biped walking, several approaches can be adopted to maintain the desired horizontal velocity.

Reference-contexts: The biped was controlled to walk in a mode called Linear Inverted Pendulum. A control methodology called Virtual Model Control (VMC) <ref> [Pratt, 1995] </ref> was recently developed for legged robots. This method is based on intuition. The resulting controller does not need the dynamics information in order for a legged robot to perform steady 1 dynamic walking. <p> The resulting controller does not need the dynamics information in order for a legged robot to perform steady 1 dynamic walking. Thus, it allows a computationally less intense framework for the control since it does not require the computation of inverse dynamics for the legged robot. <ref> [Pratt, 1995] </ref> has successfully used the VMC to control a planar biped to walk on flat ground. 1 Meaning the average horizontal velocity is constant. 9 Most research on biped locomotion has been restricted to level ground locomotion. Few have implemented bipeds that could walk on rough terrain. <p> We wish to achieve the task by using the signals from two discrete ground contact sensors located at the bottom of the bipeds feet. We also wish to achieve this task by simple modifications to the algorithm for level ground walking <ref> [Pratt, 1995] </ref>. The thesis will verify the modified algorithm by simulating a planar seven-link biped walking over sloped terrain. The followings are the assumptions made in all the simulations: 1. <p> To avoid such complexity, some researchers linearize the nonlinear dynamic equations of the biped and apply modern control techniques. The Leg Laboratory has developed a new control approach called Virtual Model Control (VMC) for the implementation of legged locomotion. The framework of this approach was well defined in <ref> [Pratt, 1995] </ref> and a comparison with other techniques like Impedance Control , Stiffness Control etc. was also included. This chapter gives a brief introduction to this approach and elaborates the details used by the biped to perform steady dynamic walking on level terrain. <p> The next section describes a simple method called Virtual Model Control which has been successfully implemented on a five-link planar biped permitting it to walk steadily on level ground. 3.2 Concept of Virtual Model Control In Virtual Model Control (VMC) <ref> [Pratt, 1995] </ref>, we use virtual components (e.g. springs, dampers etc.) to generate the required actuators forces. <p> In Virtual Model Control, B and A frames correspond to the action frame and reaction frame, respectively <ref> [Pratt, 1995] </ref>. Equation (3.1) requires much lower computation compared to inverse kinematics and dynamics. This transformation is also well-behaved since, for a given force vector in the cartesian space, we can always obtain a corresponding torque vector in the joint space even if the robot is in a singular configuration. <p> Since we are interested in the motion described in cartesian space, it is natural for us to attach virtual components along each of the orthogonal coordinates in this space. One possible set of virtual components (same as those used by <ref> [Pratt, 1995] </ref>) is shown in Figure 4. A virtual spring-damper is attached to the hip along the vertical direction to generate a virtual vertical force F z at the hip. It is used to control the vertical height of the biped. <p> That is, the biped walking bears more resemblance to birds than to humans. Though the biped has actuated ankles, we set the ankle of stance leg to be limp by commanding a zero torque. This results in a motion similar to that of the previous 5-link biped <ref> [Pratt, 1995] </ref> which had no feet. The feet of the 7-link biped simply provide better traction during the single support phase. <p> We chose to maintain the vertical and rotational spring-dampers and let the interaction between gravity and these virtual components dictate the horizontal velocity during this phase. The virtual forces for both the single and the double support phases are transformed into the joint space using the equations derived in <ref> [Pratt, 1995] </ref>. A list of the equations can be found in Appendix A. Realtime control of the biped locomotion can be implemented based on a state machine and the equations. <p> However, this approach to maintain the horizontal velocity may not be effective if the walking speed is high. This is because the actual duration of double support is very short during high speed walking. Also, although the equations developed in <ref> [Pratt, 1995] </ref> assumed that full horizontal force can be achieved during double support, this is not true in real applications since the foot of the biped is not hinged to the ground. Thus, we need to set a limit to the horizontal virtual force due to the virtual damper. <p> However, to realise the constraint control, Kajita and Tani used inverse kinematics and applied local position feedback at the joints. In the VMC, we do not need to solve any inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics of the biped <ref> [Pratt, 1995] </ref>. We simply let the virtual components generate the required cartesian forces. These forces are then transformed by a matrix to the joints torque. If the biped had massless legs, the VMC using the virtual components described in Section 3.3 would also generate a linear trajectory in cartesian space. <p> 3-D biped whose frontal plane motion control can be decoupled partially or completely from the sagittal plane motion. 61 Appendix A: Equations to convert virtual forces to joints torque A.1 Double Support Phase The equations to convert virtual forces to joints torque during the double support phase was derived in <ref> [Pratt, 1995] </ref> as shown in Equation A.1. <p> In the actual implementation, we only adopt the vertical and torsional motion control.

Reference-contexts: It is assumed that the friction will be high enough to prevent any slippage once the feet touch the ground. 2. It is assumed that the biped has perfect actuators which provide desired torque at each joint. In real systems, Series Elastics Actuators <ref> [Pratt and Williamson, 1995] </ref> are used to provide the desired torque at each joint. 3. The sloped terrain does not have step variations and the transition location between two different slope gradients is smooth.

Reference-contexts: For example, we can control the horizontal velocity of a biped by foot placement <ref> [Raibert, 1986] </ref> as in the case of a hopping machine. In walking, we have a period where both feet are on the ground (double support) and this also can be utilised for horizontal velocity control. In the previous analysis, we utilised a horizontal virtual damper to correct the horizontal velocity.

Reference-contexts: In the VMC, the biped behaves as if there is a passive suspension between the ground and the bipeds body. For sloped terrain which we assume to have no vertical step variation along its path, it is not required to have active suspension 14 described by <ref> [Raibert, 1986a] </ref>. The biped simply tries to swing the leg to achieve a desired step length, but if the swing leg prematurely hits a slope surface, the actual step 14 [Raibert, 1986a] used this term to explain the advantage of a legged machine that it could choose a foothold location so <p> to have no vertical step variation along its path, it is not required to have active suspension 14 described by <ref> [Raibert, 1986a] </ref>. The biped simply tries to swing the leg to achieve a desired step length, but if the swing leg prematurely hits a slope surface, the actual step 14 [Raibert, 1986a] used this term to explain the advantage of a legged machine that it could choose a foothold location so that the body would be decoupled from the unevenness of the terrain. 59 length will be shorter than the desired value. <p> Although the study was limited to a planar biped, the information obtained would still be useful for 3-D walking since the dominant walking dynamics of a biped happens in the sagittal plane <ref> [Raibert, 1986a] </ref>. If we can decouple partially or completely the frontal plane motion from the sagittal plane motion, we should be able to use the algorithm developed in this thesis for 3-D walking bipeds.

Reference-contexts: In the study of rough terrain locomotion by a hexapod, [Song and Waldron, 1989] classified the rough terrain into four types of geometric representations: gradient, ditch, vertical step and isolated wall ( Figure 19 ). <ref> [Raibert, 1990] </ref> said that a terrain can become rough under the following instances: 1) the ground is not level; 2) there is limited traction (slippery); 3) there are areas of poor or nonexistent support (eg., holes). (a) a gradient (b) a ditch (c) a vertical step (d) an isolated wall isolated <p> The plausibility of the VMC approach to control the biped to walk steadily and dynamically over unknown sloped terrain without any dynamics computation may seem too good to be true. This coincides with a statement made by M. Raibert <ref> [Raibert, 1990] </ref>: A legged system can exhibit complicated dynamic behavior without requiring a very complicated control system. We have also replaced the vertical virtual spring-damper with Robust Adaptive Controller which was successfully implemented for the biped to walk over random sloped terrain.

Reference-contexts: It then gives qualitative descriptions of the key parameters for walking control of the biped. To maintain a nominal height of the biped when there is a change in the load applied onto it, Robust Adaptive Controller <ref> [Slotine and Coetsee, 1986] </ref> is introduced into the control algorithm in Chapter 4 . Several simulation results are included for the study of the effect of Robust Adaptive Controls parameters. Chapter 5 includes a strategy developed for the sloped terrain walking of the biped. <p> Inspired by the VMC approach, this chapter will perform a feasibility study of the replacement of the existing vertical virtual component by Robust Adaptive Controller developed by <ref> [Slotine and Coetsee, 1986] </ref>. The purpose is to enable the biped to adapt to varying mass and walk with a height close to the desired value.

However, in a real system, l is limited by the structural resonant modes, neglected time delays and sampling rate <ref> [Slotine and Li, 1991] </ref>. Furthermore, for biped locomotion, the foot is not fixed to the ground like that of a manipulator. So, we do not want l to be too high.

Reference-contexts: Chapter 6 will demonstrate the robustness of this approach by simulating the biped walking over a series of unknown slopes. 37 5 Sloped terrain walking In a totally unstructured environment, the geometry of the terrain is usually very complex. In the study of rough terrain locomotion by a hexapod, <ref> [Song and Waldron, 1989] </ref> classified the rough terrain into four types of geometric representations: gradient, ditch, vertical step and isolated wall ( Figure 19 ). [Raibert, 1990] said that a terrain can become rough under the following instances: 1) the ground is not level; 2) there is limited traction (slippery); 3) <p> said that a terrain can become rough under the following instances: 1) the ground is not level; 2) there is limited traction (slippery); 3) there are areas of poor or nonexistent support (eg., holes).

Reference-contexts: The desired joints trajectories can be achieved by nonlinear control techniques like computed torque control [Mitobe et al., 1995] , robust control <ref> [Tzafestas et al., 1996] </ref> , adaptive control [Yang, 1994], etc.. However, this way of controlling a biped is computationally intensive as we need to compute the inverse dynamics. To avoid such complexity, some researchers linearize the nonlinear dynamic equations of the biped and apply modern control techniques.

Reference-contexts: The same walking gait could be used for walking on level ground or on a slope. The implementation of the strategy was simple.

The biped had a special foot system (WAF-3) which was used to obtain a position relative to a landing surface and the gradient of the surface during its dynamic walking.

This is complicated by the fact that in the single support phase, we lose an actuated degree of freedom at the ankle especially if the ankle is limp.

Reference-contexts: This provides us with a very good motivation to extend the VMC to rough terrain locomotion of a biped. 1.2 Previous work <ref> [Zheng and Shen, 1990] </ref> have done research on a biped (SD-2) which walked on a slope in a statically stable way. <p> The biped is assumed to be walking on level ground before encountering a slope of unknown transition location and gradient. The biped is just like a blind creature and it should be able to adjust its gait based on its interaction with the slope <ref> [Zheng and Shen, 1990] </ref>. This thesis assumes that the terrain has no vertical variation along the walking direction and no variation perpendicular to the sagittal plane. The minimum and maximum slope gradients are -20 o and +20 o , respectively. <p> We first discuss the level-to-upslope and downslope-to-level transition. For level-to-upslope transition, we employ a strategy similar to the one adopted by <ref> [Zheng and Shen, 1990] </ref>. In their approach, when their biped was walking statically from level ground to an upslope surface, it employed a compliant stepping motion when the foot of its swing leg first came into contact 42 with the sloped surface.
