Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Networks of Workstations (NOW) are becoming increasingly popular for providing cost-effective and affordable parallel computing for day-to-day computational needs <ref> [1, 11, 34] </ref>. Such environments consist of clusters of workstations connected by Local Area Networks (LANs). Hardware and software LAN technology was not initially developed for parallel processing, and thus the communication overhead between workstations can be quite high.

Reference-contexts: However, most of these research projects focus on homogeneous NOW systems where similar kinds of workstations (nodes) are connected over a single network architecture. Some popular network architectures used in the current NOW environments are Ethernet, ATM <ref> [2] </ref>, FDDI, Fiber-Channel, and cut-through routed networks such as SP-2 [33] and Myrinet [4]. Due to the commodity nature of workstations and networking equipment, LAN environments are gradually becoming heterogeneous. <p> Thus, algorithms for collective communication need to take care of these characteristics to achieve reduced latency. Communication protocols: Current generation LANs typically support different communication protocols (such as TCP/IP, ATM <ref> [2] </ref>, and FM [28]) which workstations (nodes) use to communicate. These protocols have their own characteristics and affect the latency of communication operations. Furthermore, some nodes may have access to more than one set of protocols.

Reference-contexts: Second, the two subtrees must themselves be optimal. The same procedure can be applied recursively to each of the multicast subtrees. Therefore, this optimization problem which exhibits optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems properties can be solved by using the dynamic programming technique <ref> [9] </ref>. This technique can be used for the current problem as follows. Let L i;A be the minimum latency required to multicast the message from node W i to all nodes in the set A. If A is an empty set, the latency will be equal to zero.

Reference-contexts: We measured round trip latency between four different pairs of workstations in a heterogeneous environment. The workstations were connected via Ethernet and used MPICH communication library <ref> [12] </ref> to communicate. Table 1 shows these results. Since the results are symmetric, values are shown for only the upper triangle entries. These values indicate how processor speed affects the time taken to transmit a message from one workstation to another.

We evaluated our new algorithms (indicated as SPOC and FNF in the graphs) with the default ordering algorithm (indicated as DEF) which is used by the current MPI implementations.

Reference-contexts: Faster nodes are assigned to higher levels of the tree so that they can pass the message to their descendents with reduced latency. In a multiple multicast operation, more than one group of nodes participate in the multicast <ref> [17] </ref>. Each group has its own source and destination nodes. Each node can be the source of at most one multicast while, a node can appear in more than one group as one of the destinations.

Reference-contexts: The ratio of the communication capabilities of slow and fast nodes is therefore 2:15:1:0. 7.1.2 Broadcast For measuring the broadcast latency we followed a method similar to the one used in <ref> [19] </ref>. A broadcast operation starts when the source node initiates it. It is said to be complete when all the other nodes have received the broadcast message. The broadcast latency is defined as the time elapsed between the source node initiating it and the last recipient receiving it. <p> Measurement of broadcast latency was done in the following way. For an N node system, N 1 broadcasts were performed. Each time, after the broadcast, one of the N 1 recipients sent back an acknowledgment (instead of issuing another broadcast as in <ref> [19] </ref>). At the source node the time between initiation of the broadcast and receipt of the acknowledgment was measured. The maximum of these N 1 time readings corresponds to the last broadcast recipient sending back the acknowledgment.

Reference-contexts: We first introduce a new Speed-Partitioned Ordered Chain (SPOC) approach to order the participating nodes of a collective communication based on their communication capabilities. Using this framework, broadcast and multi-cast collective communication operations are implemented with reduced latency using binomial trees <ref> [23] </ref>. Then, we argue that using binomial trees might not be the best approach for implementing these collective operations. We propose a method for finding optimal trees for broadcast and multicast operations. <p> Because of the high value of t ini (which is typical of NOW systems) let us ignore the time required for transmitting the messages in our example. Consider a naive and simple binomial-tree-based scheme <ref> [23] </ref>, based on node numbering. This leads to the broadcast tree as shown in Fig. 1 (a). Using this scheme the broadcast can be completed in 700.0 microsec in this HNOW environment. <p> In this section, we first present the basic idea behind this approach. Then, we present algorithms for broadcast and multicast (single and multiple) operations. 4.1 Basic Idea Consider a collective communication operation, say broadcast, which can be implemented by using a binomial-tree <ref> [23] </ref>. The binomial-tree algorithm is well suited for homogeneous networks. However, nodes that are higher up in the binomial tree send more messages and therefore incur more message startup overhead. <p> We can sort participating nodes in ascending order of message initiation cost and then assign faster participating nodes to tree nodes with greater number of descendents from these two sorted lists. It can be observed that the dimension-ordered chain <ref> [23] </ref> resulting from such an assignment will use faster nodes in the initial steps of the communication and will lead to reduced broadcast latency. We call this ordered chain of participating nodes a Speed-Partitioned Ordered Chain (SPOC).

Due to the commodity nature of workstations and networking equipment, LAN environments are gradually becoming heterogeneous. The capability of a LAN environment to incrementally expand by incorporating new generations of workstations and network architectures over a period of time is also forcing this trend.

Reference-contexts: The need for collective communication operations such as broadcast, multicast, global reduction, scatter, gather, complete exchange, and barrier synchronization arises frequently in parallel applications <ref> [3, 5, 6, 13, 18, 22, 25, 29, 35] </ref>. Thus, it is critical that the collective communication operations be implemented in the best possible manner (scalable as well as high performance) in a HNOW system. Recently, some projects have emphasized issues related to collective communication in NOW systems.

Reference-contexts: Recently, some projects have emphasized issues related to collective communication in NOW systems. These projects have been centered around the following interconnects: ATM [14], Ethernet [37], and Myrinet <ref> [36] </ref>. Performance of collective communication operations in NOW environments have been evaluated in [20, 27]. However, all these studies focus on only one type of interconnect in a NOW system. They also do not consider heterogeneity in workstation speeds, communication protocols, etc. <p> 2 ; ; W N1 g is the list of other participating nodes in a nondecreasing order with respect to their message initiation cost, can be expressed as: T SP OC broadcast = dlog Ne1 X i=0 ini ; t 2 i 1 4.3 Multicast (Single and Multiple) A multicast <ref> [8, 26, 15, 16, 31, 36] </ref> operation involves only a subset of workstations in the HNOW environment. The above approach for broadcast can also be used for efficient implementation of single multicast. A binomial tree is first created with the participating nodes in the multicast.
