Abstract: In this paper we study approximation methods for analytic functions that have been "spliced" into non-intersecting sub-domains. We assume that we are given the first 2N + 1 Fourier coefficients for the functions in each sub-domain. The objective is to approximate the "spliced" function in each sub-domain and then to "glue" the approximations together in order to recover the original function in the full domain. The Fourier partial sum approximation in each sub-domain yields poor results, as the convergence is slow and spurious oscillations occur at the boundaries of each sub-domain. Thus once we "glue" the sub-domain approximations back together, the approximation for the function in the full domain will exhibit oscillations throughout the entire domain. Recently methods have been developed that successfully eliminate the Gibbs phenomenon for analytic but non-periodic functions in one dimension. These methods are based on the knowledge of the first 2N + 1 Fourier coefficients and use either the Gegenbauer polynomials (Gottlieb et al.) or the Bernoulli polynomials (Abarbanel, Gottlieb, Cai et al., and Eckhoff). We propose a way to accurately reconstruct a "spliced" function in a full domain by extending the current methods to eliminate the Gibbs phenomenon in each nonintersecting sub-domain and then "gluing" the approximations back together. We solve this problem in both one and two dimensions. In the one-dimensional case we provide two alternative options, the Bernoulli method and the Gegenbauer method, as well as a new hybrid method, the Gegenbauer-Bernoulli method. In the two-dimensional case we prove, for the very first time, exponential convergence of the Gegenbauer method, and then we apply it to solve the "spliced" function problem.

Reference-contexts: the resulting Fourier approximation after "splicing" f (x) into different non-intersecting sub-domains no longer converges! Recently, methods based on the knowledge of the Fourier coefficients ^ f (k) of a smooth but non-periodic function f (x) in a general interval [a; b], have been developed ([1], [10], [12], and later <ref> [7] </ref>) that successfully eliminate the Gibbs phenomenon.

Reference-contexts: The convergence rate of equation (1.1) for non-periodic functions is slow with error O ( 1 N ) away from the boundaries, and exhibits spurious oscillations of order O (1) at the boundaries.

Furthermore, summing the approximations in each sub-domain to obtain an approximation to f (x) over the entire domain [a; b] results in the spurious oscillations at the center point x = c as well as at the exterior boundary points x = a and x = b.

The regularization error is estimated in the maximum norm. <p> defined by RE ( 1 ; 2 ; m 1 ; m 2 ) = max 1 y 1 m 1 X m 2 X ^ f 1 ; 2 1 (x)C 2 The exponential convergence of the regularization error has already been proved for the one dimensional case in <ref> [12] </ref>, and here we just extend the results into two-dimensions. We start by stating the following assumption and lemma. Assumption 6.1 Let f (x; y) be an analytic function for 1 x 1 and 1 y 1.

Reference-contexts: Another consideration is that we have assumed knowledge of the jump discontinuity locations. The Bernoulli method has been developed to locate jump discontinuities, but not without affecting the accuracy of the approximation [7]. This is still being investigated for the Gegenbauer method, although it has been shown in <ref> [13] </ref> that the method works well as we approach the discontinuity. This is promising in the sense that even if only an approximate location of the discontinuity is known, accurate (even spectral) results using the Gegenbauer method can still be obtained.

As observed in <ref> [15] </ref>, the Gegenbauer method suffers from round-off error for a large number of Gegenbauer polynomials, m, particularly when using the pseudo-spectral Fourier coefficients. We would like to counteract this error by resolving the function with m as small as possible. <p> Much work was done in order to avoid the inevitable ill-conditioning of the matrix in (2.14). It has been suggested in <ref> [15] </ref> (in regards to another Gegenbauer-type hybrid approximation method) to use the Gegenbauer method to obtain the jump coefficients. This will eliminate the ill-conditioning of the system (2.14) 16 at the cost of requiring more points to resolve the function. <p> Now we are able to split the function into different pieces and solve for the "smoother" parts of the function in smaller sub-domains. This question was also addressed in <ref> [15] </ref>, but the approach was different than ours. Secondly, we can assume that we only have access to the Fourier coefficients of a function in various sub-domains, and hence our method is directly applicable. <p> Furthermore, the Gegenbauer method will tolerate perturbations in the pseudospectral Fourier coefficients. This paper did not address a few things that will be discussed in future papers. 1. The parameters and m have not been optimized in the two-dimensional Gegen bauer method. 2. In <ref> [15] </ref> the Gegenbauer method is used to find the jump coefficients. It may be possible to use this approach in creating a hybrid method combining the Gegen bauer and Bernoulli methods in two dimensions. 3. We are assuming explicit knowledge of the points of discontinuity.
