Abstract: Conventional video cameras have limited fields of view that make them restrictive in certain vision applications. A catadioptric sensor uses a combination of lenses and mirrors placed in a carefully designed configuration to capture a much wider field of view. In particular, the shape of the mirror must be selected to ensure that the complete catadioptric system has a single effective viewpoint, which is a requirement for the generation of pure perspective images from the sensed image. In this paper, we derive and analyze the complete class of single-lens single-mirror catadioptric sensors which satisfy the fixed viewpoint constraint. Some solutions turn out to be degenerate with no practical value while other solutions lead to realizable sensors.

Reference-contexts: An effective way to enhance the field of view is to use mirrors in conjunction with lenses. This approach to image formation is fast gaining in popularity (see [ Nayar, 1988 ] , [ Yagi and Kawato, 1990 ] , [ Hong, 1991 ] , <ref> [ Goshtasby and Gruver, 1993 ] </ref> , [ Yamazawa et al., 1993 ] , [ Nalwa, 1996 ] [ Nayar, 1997 ] ). We refer to the general approach of incorporating mirrors into conventional imaging systems as catadioptric 1 image formation. <p> On the brighter side, the two views of a scene needed for stereo can be captured by a single lens and two planar mirrors, as shown in <ref> [ Goshtasby and Gruver, 1993 ] </ref> . joining the pinhole and the desired viewpoint. Since two planar mirrors cannot generate the same viewpoint, multiple planar mirrors cannot be used to enhance the field of view of a conventional imaging system.

As recently noted in [ Yamazawa et al., 1993 ] , [ Nalwa, 1996 ] and [ Nayar, 1997 ] , it is highly desirable that the catadioptric system (or any imaging system, for that matter) have a single center of projection (viewpoint). <p> As the viewpoint approaches the pinhole, the mirror reduces in size but the curvatures at all points on the mirror increase. This increases the optical effects of coma and astigmatism that are known to produce blurring <ref> [ Hecht and Zajac, 1974 ] </ref> . Furthermore, it is hard to configure an imaging system with a large enough depth of field close to the pinhole that would allow the hyperboloidal mirror to be placed in close proximity.

The locus in the case of the sphere can turn out to be a surface of large extent, depending on the distance between the center of the sphere and the pinhole. In <ref> [ Nayar, 1988 ] </ref> , a stereo system is proposed that uses a single image of two specular spheres to compute depth.

A single viewpoint permits the creation of pure perspective images from the image sensed by the catadioptric system. <p> Consequently, both calibration as well as the computation of perspective images are greatly simplified. There are simple ways to achieve pure orthographic projection, as described in <ref> [ Nayar, 1997 ] </ref> . The shape of the mirror in this case can be derived by assuming orthographic projection rather than perspective projection in the dioptric stage of image formation. This derivation is given in [ Nayar, 1997 ] and the mirror is shown to be 2 Note that k <p> There are simple ways to achieve pure orthographic projection, as described in <ref> [ Nayar, 1997 ] </ref> .

If the paraboloid is terminated at its focus, the imaging system yields a hemispherical field of view. As shown in <ref> [ Nayar, 1997 ] </ref> , two such imaging systems can be placed back-to-back to achieve a spherical field of view. 4 Resolution Here, we define resolution as the solid angle sub-tended from the viewpoint by a pixel in the sensed image. <p> Hence, the spatial resolution for any catadioptric sensor can be written as d! p For instance, in the case of a paraboloidal mirror <ref> [ Nayar, 1997 ] </ref> , the resolution increases by a factor of 4 from the vertex (t = h=2) of the paraboloid to the fringe (t = h).
