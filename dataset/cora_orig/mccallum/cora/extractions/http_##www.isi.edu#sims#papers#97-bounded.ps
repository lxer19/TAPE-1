Abstract: Semantic query optimization (SQO) is a promising approach to the optimization of increasingly complex query plans in global information systems. The idea of SQO is to use semantic rules about data to reformulate a query into an equivalent but less expensive one. Since it is difficult to encode required semantic rules, a complete SQO system also includes a rule induction system and a rule maintainer. To maximize the net utility of learning, a rule induction system needs to learn those rules that are effective in reducing the query execution cost while robust against data changes to minimize the rule maintenance cost. This paper focuses on this tradeoff between effectiveness and robustness in the rule induction for SQO. The solution is to explicitly estimate the degree of the robustness of rules. The system can use the estimated robustness to make decisions to guide rule construction, guide rule repair, and control the size of a rule set. This paper also briefly reviews how robustness can be efficiently estimated and reports the initial experimental results. Example 1: Suppose we have a query that retrieves the ship classes and the maximal draft of the ships in those classes which satisfy the following conditions: the ships in the class are capable of carrying containers, and their draft is less than 50 feet. This query is specified as follows: THEN ship( ,?class, , , ) R1 states that If the maximum draft of a ship is less than 50, then its status is active. R2 states that If a ship class has container capability, then there must exist some ships that belong to that ship class in the database. ?draft &lt; 50. This new query is equivalent to the original query, because literal 4 is redundant according to R1, and from R2 literal 2 is also redundant. Therefore, the optimized query will still return the same answer. Since the system does not need to evaluate the redundant comparisons and relational joins, executing the optimized query will save much query execution cost. 2

Reference-contexts: Effectiveness of Learned Rules The first experiment is to evaluate whether the learning approach can generate effective rules for cost reduction in a given database state. This experiment applies a k-fold cross validation <ref> (Cohen 1995) </ref> to test the effectiveness of the learned rules. The 23 training queries were randomly divided into four sets, three of them contain 6 queries, and one contains 5 queries.
