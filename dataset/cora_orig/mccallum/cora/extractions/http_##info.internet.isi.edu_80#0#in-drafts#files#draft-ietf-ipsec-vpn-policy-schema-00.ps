Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction IPSec <ref> [1] </ref>, [2], [4] is a fairly large and complex protocol requiring participating hosts to negotiate a number of configuration parameters during protocol operation. These parameters typically have security related implications, so that defaults specified in the IPSec documents may not be acceptable to certain end hosts.

Reference-contexts: In the light of the above discussion, it is plausible that manual configuration of each IPSec host will become less and less viable as more hosts become IPSec enabled. Directory based policy administration is becoming increasingly popular as a versatile and uniform means of managing network services. LDAP <ref> [3] </ref> is a widely deployed industry standard for accessing directory information. This document presents an LDAP schema for storing IPSec based policy information in a central directory.

Reference-contexts: An object of this class ``pieces together'' several policy components relating to differentiated services, RSVP and IPSec based VPNs. Only the IPSec related parameters are described here; the RSVP and differentiated services related parameters are described in a related document <ref> [6] </ref>. A Policy rule is encoded as if &lt;PolicyCondition&gt; then &lt;PolicyAction&gt; A PolicyCondition class specifies attributes that determine when a policy rule applies. These include validity time related parameters and traffic descriptors such as ranges of IP packet header attributes, MAC addresses etc. <p> The PolicyAction class is subclassed into a number of protocol or service specific actions -- DiffServAction, RSVPAction, ISAKMPAction and IPSecSecurityAction. The QoS related classes: DiffServAction, RSVPAction, DiffServResourceGroup and RSVPResourceGroup are defined in a related document <ref> [6] </ref>. This document focuses on the IPSec related classes ISAKMPAction and IPSecSecurityAction. The ISAKMPAction class specifies attributes required to perform an ISAKMP/Oakley Phase 1 exchange. These include exchange mode, authentication types, Phase 1 proposals, Phase 1 connection management parameters etc. The proposals are described by references to ISAKMPProposal objects.

Finally, given a device identity, it must be possible to find all the policies applicable for that device. The auxiliary class PolicyContainmentAuxClass as defined in the DEN specification <ref> [7] </ref> is for that purpose. It can be attached to a variety of classes that describe devices. The PolicyContainmentAuxClass itself contains an attribute PoliciesContainedRef describing a list of related policies. <p> PolicyContainmentAuxClass Policy rules may need to be grouped together for a number of different purposes -- organizational, security, ease of administration, or ease of retrieval by a policy decision point. We reproduce the PolicyContainmentAuxClass from the DEN specification <ref> [7] </ref> that serves the useful purpose of grouping policies together. This auxillary class definition is as follows: NAME PolicyContainmentAuxClass TYPE Auxillary DERIVED FROM Top AUXILIARY CLASS None POSSIBLE SUPERIORS Organization, OrganizationalUnit, Group, Bhattacharya et. al.
