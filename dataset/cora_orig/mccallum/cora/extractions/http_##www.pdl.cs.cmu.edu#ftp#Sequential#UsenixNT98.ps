Abstract: Large-scale database, data mining, and multimedia applications require large, sequential transfers and have bandwidth as a key requirement. This paper i n-vestigates the performance of reading and writing large sequential files using the Windows NT 4.0 File System. The study explores the performance of Intel Pentium Pro based memory and IO subsystems, i n-cluding the processor bus, the PCI bus, the SCSI bus, the disk controllers, and the disk media in a typical server or high-end desktop system. We provide details of the overhead costs at each level of the system and examine a variety of the available tuning knobs. We show that NTFS out-of-the-box performance is quite good, but overheads for small requests can be quite high. The best performance is achieved by using large requests, bypassing the file system cache, spreading the data across many disks and controllers, and using deep-asynchronous requests. This combination allows us to reach or exceed the half-power point of all the individual hardware components.

Reference-contexts: The file system then coalesces sequential requests into large 64 KB writes, leading to relatively constant throughput above 4 KB. Disk controllers also implement write-through and write-back caching, controlled by the Write-Cache-Enable (WCE) setting directly at the device <ref> [SCSI93] </ref>. If WCE is disabled, the disk controller announces IO completion only after the media write is complete. If WCE is enabled, the disk announces write completion as soon as the data is stored in its cache and before the actual write onto the magnetic disk media. <p> System behavior under large reads and writes is very different. During the read tests, processor load is fairly 1 Enabling WCE improves performance but risks corruption if the disk fails while uncommitted data is in its cache. The on-disk cache may also be lost by SCSI bus resets <ref> [SCSI93] </ref>. uniform. The file system prefetches data into the cache and then copies the data to the applications buffer. The file cache buffer can be reused as soon as the data is copied to the application. During the write tests, the processor load goes through three phases.

Reference-contexts: Intelligence and caching in the drive allows overlap and parallelism across requests so simple behavioral models no longer capture the behavior. Moreover, drive behavior changes significantly across impl e-mentations <ref> [Worthington95] </ref>. While the media-transfer limit remains a valid half-power point target for bulk file transfers, understanding smaller scale or smaller data set disk behavior seems difficult at best. 5.2 SCSI Bus Activity We used a bus analyzer to measure SCSI bus activity.
