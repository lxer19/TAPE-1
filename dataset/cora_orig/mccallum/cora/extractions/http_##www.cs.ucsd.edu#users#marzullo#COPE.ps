Reference-contexts: Hence, required is a mechanism for containing the damage that a faulty subject does before it is detected. The mechanism that we use is based on optimistic protocols <ref> [1] </ref>, and is packaged as a set of OrbixWeb ORB-based CORBA services. These services are described in Section 2. <p> This requirement is called the output commit problem. The Serrano CORBA service that implements this abstraction is called COPE. It is strongly influenced by the PVM-based HOPE system <ref> [1] </ref>. The two principal CORBA interfaces are Assumption and Optimist. The IDL for COPE is given in Figures 2 and 3. A COPE assumption is a CORBA object. Assumption factories create assumptions. An assumption is a simple state machine that starts in the state AS_UNKNOWN.

Reference-contexts: Not all intrusion detection systems identify the subject that is likely an intruder. For example, some report only that there is suspicious behavior indicating that an intruder is active rather than identifying a subject as being an intruder <ref> [2] </ref>; * It should provide a measure of uncertainty. There is always uncertainty in the determination of a subject being an intruder.

Reference-contexts: We call this "proactive intrusion detection". The technique is not new , but having it driven by intrusion detection is unusual. (A. Gross, for example, has worked in this direction <ref> [3] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: For example, one could determine P (b) by comparing the relative frequency of commands in b with their relative frequencies in the runs of N x <ref> [4] </ref>. The set U x is empty. The intrusion detection policy sets some value for r x , and a x is undefined. Neither of these two classes, however, support our model of using optimism to aid in the detection of intrusion.
