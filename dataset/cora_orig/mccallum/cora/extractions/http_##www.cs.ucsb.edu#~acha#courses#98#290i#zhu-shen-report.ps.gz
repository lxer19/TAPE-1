Reference-contexts: when workload size increases which infers factor 1 dominates. 6 analysis for hit ratio since average memory access time solely depends on hit ratio when cache line size is fixed. 5 Analysis In this section, we analyze the impacts of those chosen factors quantitatively by using multiple factor analysis method <ref> [1] </ref>. In Table 2 and Table 3, different levels mean different choices for each factor in increasing order. For instance, level 1 for cache size means 16 kbytes while level 4 means 1 Mbytes. The average hit ratio is 90% and the average memory access cycles (AMAC) is 12.12.

Reference-contexts: We choose 32 bytes, 64 bytes, 128 bytes and 256 bytes since they range over all possible cache line sizes of existing cache architectures <ref> [2] </ref>. 3.2 Workload We artificially generate test data sets from the alphabet f1; 2; ; 2 31 1g.
