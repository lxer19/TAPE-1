Abstract: This paper presents a survey on security issues in mobile computing. Mobile Computing rises completely different security concerns and threats than they are common in traditional wired networks. Authentication, Privacy and Anonymity are challenging research topics in a wireless environment and all of them are by far not covered in depth by the research community. This is a short overview of the current state of development.

Reference-contexts: One of the most single sources for compromising our privacy every day are 6 credit cards. With each financial transaction using these cards, we disclose our identity to the payee and furthermore we reveal our spending and movement habits to the central clearinghouse and the credit card issuer <ref> [HKT94] </ref>. As a result, anonymity and privacy demands are seriously violated. <p> Links on the fixed part of the network between multiple MDISs are considered secure and are posing the same risks as the wired network part in the GSM system. 4.2 Time-based aliases To enforce Anonymity in a mobile environment, the use of time-based aliases was proposed in <ref> [HKT94] </ref>. The following figure will describe the information flow between the User U , the Authentication Server of the remote domain AS Y and the home domain AS X . The goal is to keep the user identity secret from the remote domain. Figure: Time-based Aliases [HKT94] 8 The time-based alias <p> aliases was proposed in <ref> [HKT94] </ref>. The following figure will describe the information flow between the User U , the Authentication Server of the remote domain AS Y and the home domain AS X . The goal is to keep the user identity secret from the remote domain. Figure: Time-based Aliases [HKT94] 8 The time-based alias SU ID is computed using a strong one-way hash function f as the following: SU ID = f (U; T U ; K UX ) The user and its home domain (D X ) share a secret key K UX .

Reference-contexts: This is done by negotiating between the foreign and the home domain following a certain protocol. In the case of a (fast) moving mobile unit, there should be a way to hand over the user's state between multiple foreign domains in real-time. <ref> [McS96] </ref> discusses the issue of seamless session handover. 3.1 GSM Authentication The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a european Standard for digital cellular phone systems. It allows users in a growing number of countries to make and receive telephone calls with small hand-held devices.

Reference-contexts: It allows users in a growing number of countries to make and receive telephone calls with small hand-held devices. To set up a communication link there is an authentication protocol implemented which is described in the following <ref> [MST94] </ref>. When a Mobile Station (MS) pops up in a new network cell, it informs the service provider's Base Station (BS) and Visitors Location Register (VLR) of its communication request by sending its International Mobile System Identity (IMSI). <p> The computed session key K c is used to encrypt symmetrically the future data transfer between the Mobile Station and the Base Station. The MS is authenticated to the foreign domains BS when the signed responses received from the HLR and the MS match. 4 Figure: GSM Authentication Protocol <ref> [MST94] </ref> There are various drawbacks of the GSM Authentication Protocol known. Most of them have to do with anonymity issues and are discussed in that section. All algorithms in the GSM environment are classified and have to be bought as complete Integrated Circuits which are protected from reverse engineering. <p> This security through obscurity method is no longer acceptable in a world of open standards and has seldom performed effectively. 3.2 Two Party Authentication Protocol In the Krypto Knight Two Party Authentication Protocol as described in <ref> [MST94] </ref>, both the Mobile Unit M and the Home Domain H share a secret key K MH . <p> By decrypting the ticket and comparing the nonces, R authenticates the communication request of the Mobile Station and sends a ticket specifying a newly created session key K. K is used to encrypt any future communication between the Mobile Unit and the Remote Domain. Figure: Two Party Authentication Protocol <ref> [MST94] </ref> By using a traveling alias instead of the real identity of M when establishing the first part of the authentication process, anonymity of the mobile user can be easily enforced. <p> the requested data to. 4.1 GSM and CDPD When we look in terms of privacy and authentication at the european and north-American digital cellular standards GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data), we can observe that both systems have serious weaknesses in their communication procedures <ref> [MST94] </ref>. In a GSM network, the Mobile Unit is always under control of a nearby Base Station (BS). When the mobile leaves a network cell a handover takes place to forward the user's identity and current status from one BS to the next.

Reference-contexts: As a result, anonymity and privacy demands are seriously violated. For future electronic cash applications are therefore homeless environments proposed, where a cash or credit payment can not be associated with a specific customer. <ref> [SM94] </ref> proposes a Classification of Anonymity with different levels of user privacy towards the home and foreign authorities. The basic level demands to hide the User Identity from third parties and eavesdroppers. This can be achieved by encrypting the user identifications and protecting the transmission channel.
