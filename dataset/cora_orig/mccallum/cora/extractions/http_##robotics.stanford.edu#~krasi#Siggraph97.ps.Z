Abstract: Force feedback coupled with visual display allows people to interact intuitively with complex virtual environments. For this synergy of haptics and graphics to flourish, however, haptic systems must be capable of modeling environments with the same richness, complexity and interactivity that can be found in existing graphic systems. To help meet this challenge, we have developed a haptic rendering system that allows for the efficient tactile display of graphical information. The system uses a common high-level framework to model contact constraints, surface shading, friction and tex ture. The multilevel control system also helps ensure that the haptic device will remain stable even as the limits of the renderers capabilities are reached.

Reference-contexts: The separation of the haptic and application/graphic processes was first proposed by Adachi et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. Decoupling the low-level force servo loop from the high-level control is important since the haptic servo loop must run at a very high rate, typically greater than 1000Hz, to achieve a high fidelity force display. Most application programs typically run at a much slower rate (~30Hz).

Reference-contexts: Without evaluating the texture values along the path these gridlines may be missed. Another interesting approach to the modeling of textures is based on the modification of the forceshading constraint planes in a manner similar to that employed in bump mapping in computer graphics <ref> [4] </ref>. Our current texture bump-map technique can generate one additional constraint plane for each textured surface. This approach is adequate to model SIGGRAPH 97, Los Angeles, California, August 3-8, 1997 continuously differentiable textured surfaces.

Reference-contexts: Reducing position error of a mechanical system is a problem which has been discussed extensively in the robotics literature <ref> [6] </ref>. In our current implementation we rely on a simple operational space proportional derivative (PD) controller [13]. As all modeling effects are achieved by the movem ent of the proxy, controller gains and other parameters can be set by sole consideration of the properties of the mechanical system.

Reference-contexts: This problem may be treated using the same algorithms employed in the collision detection process <ref> [8] </ref>. The vertices of the closest face, edge or vertex indicate that the corresponding constraint planes bound the solution. An example of this mapping is shown in Figure 4. As illustrated, the solution x is constrained by planes a, b and the plane at infinity o.

Reference-contexts: This problem may be solved using a standard quadratic programming package such as that introduced by Gill et. al <ref> [9] </ref>. In our case, however, there are many simplifications that make possible a simpler and faster solution. In our implementation, this problem is solved in two steps. The minimum set of active constraint planes is found first; this set is then used to find a new subgoal position.
