Reference-contexts: This was compensated for by registering the markers to an idealized model of the calibration object based on its manufacturing specifications. A rigid transformation was determined by finding the minimum least squares error between the CT markers positions and the idealized model. We used the method developed by <ref> [Arun 87] </ref> using the SVD of the covariance matrix formed from the outer product of the positions vectors of the points in the two spaces. The mean square error for this transformation was less than 1mm. Although this in itself is rather large, the error appears to be randomly scattered.

Reference-contexts: Since we are interested in simulating our data using the estimates of the intrinsic parameters derived from the calibration, it is not sufficient to accurately fit a nonphysical model of the system as was performed by <ref> [Champleboux 92] </ref>,[Martins 81]. These methods are based on the two-planes method and makes no assumptions about rays intersecting at a center of perspective (or focal point).

Reference-contexts: Figure 3.1 shows the CT data (red) rigidly transformed to match the idealized calibration object (blue). The 3D positions of idealized calibration object markers were subsequently used in matching with 2D x-ray marker positions. X-ray marker localization was performed by procedures developed by <ref> [Gueziec 95] </ref>. Thresholding was used to find iso-contours of markers. These were isolated using connected components. Marker position was determined as the centroid of components which satisfied several properties that distinguished markers from nonmarker contours. These properties included compactness, a range of contour lengths, and whether the contour was closed.

When the attenuation of different energies are indenpendent, it is not difficult to use this result to derive the ray integral for a polychromatic beam.

Reference-contexts: If these approximations cannot be used, then one approach used in reconstruction is to empirically derive a polynomial function which relates the polychromatic ray sum to the monochromatic sum <ref> [Herman 80] </ref>. In addition to the polychromatic nature of x-ray sources, the intensity of many diagnostic x-ray sources varies from one side of the source to the other. This is a physical property of the x-ray source because of the way it is constructed.

Reference-contexts: Chapter 2 Localization using Multiple X-rays X-rays are often used intra-operatively to guide surgeons in locating internal structures. They have also been used, in conjunction with markers, to track the motion of the heart <ref> [Hunter 89] </ref>, or to reconstruct blood vessels in angiography [Rowley 94]. They are similarly used in beam therapy to locate the optimal position for radiation treatment [Schweikard 94]. In all of these applications and many others, multiple x-rays are used to derive the relative 3D position and location of structures. <p> Figure ?? shows the basic components of a conventional and fluoroscopic radiographic systems. x-ray calibration arises in many different applications.

Reference-contexts: When the attenuation of different energies are indenpendent, it is not difficult to use this result to derive the ray integral for a polychromatic beam. It is approximately, I out = i R detector source fi i (x;y;z)dxdydzg di where i is the range of energy levels <ref> [Kak 88] </ref>. Since, in general, attenuation decreases as the energy level increases, evidence of the occurance of beam hardening should manifest itself as relatively decreased attenuation (increased intensity) due to the hardening of the energy spectrum. We would roughly expect this effect to be greatest where the integral is greatest. <p> This is the monochromatic energy at which a given material will exhibit the same attenuation coefficient as is measured by the true polychromatic energy of the scanner <ref> [Kak 88] </ref>. If these approximations cannot be used, then one approach used in reconstruction is to empirically derive a polynomial function which relates the polychromatic ray sum to the monochromatic sum [Herman 80]. <p> For a photon energy of 60 KeV, fi w = 0:21cm 1 . In practice, a scanner must be calibrated and may need to be linearly scaled according to the difference between the actual and measured attenuation of water and air <ref> [Kak 88] </ref>. A modern CT scanner is accurate to 2 Hounsfield units [Shung 92]. 39 Hounsfield units vary from -1000 (for air) to 1000 (for dense bone) and are typically stored as short integers using 12 or 16 bits.

Reference-contexts: They concluded that accuracy in 3D reconstruction was dependent on all the parameters, although error in localization in the axes which are not orthogonal between the biplanar x-rays was the most critical. The work conducted by <ref> [Kumar 92] </ref> was concerned with determining the pose (camera position and orientation) for a matched set of 3D model and 2D image features. However, in addition, they analyzed the effects of small errors in intrinsic parameters on pose determination.

Reference-contexts: Later, we will use these results to evaluate the results of our registration methods. Therefore, we would like to know the accuracy of the calibration. First, we confirmed that the nonlinear optimization was insensitve to the initial estimate. Nonlinear optimization was performed using Levenberg-Marquadt <ref> [Press 92] </ref>. For our visual initial estimates, convergence was obtained in 32 and 8 iterations for configuration 1 and 2 respectively. As long as the initial estimate was coarsely correct, the system converged to the same solution.

Reference-contexts: For their data, consisting of eight markers localized on biplanar x-rays, the source position error was greatest along the optic axis. Assuming target localization error (standard deviation) of 0.1 pixel, 3D target estimation error would be, computed analytically and via simulations, less than 0.1mm. <ref> [Rougee 93] </ref> compared two methods, an unconstrained generalized inverse method and a nonlinear optimization (similar to our approach) by evaluating the error in the parameters, (and the error in using these parameters to perform reprojection, i.e., the error in 3D reconstruction) using simulated data with noise for a few relevant cases.

This is often corrected using a planar grid of markers placed on the face on the intensifier screen <ref> [Schueler 95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In their study, nonlinear optimization was more accurate than the linear least squares solution, in particular, in the case where there are only a few fiducials. This is not surprising since the linear method is under-constrained. 18 <ref> [Smith 78] </ref> evaluated the error in 3D reconstruction of multiple x-rays given error in parameter estimation.
