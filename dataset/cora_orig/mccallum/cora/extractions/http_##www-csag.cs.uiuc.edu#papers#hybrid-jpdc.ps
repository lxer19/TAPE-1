Abstract: We investigate the performance of wormhole-routed networks under bimodal traffic distributions, a mix of short and long messages. Our studies show that the presence of long messages degrades network performance for short messages dramatically, qualitatively changing network behavior. We present an analytical model for wormhole-routed networks which not only models network performance under uniformly-sized message loads more accurately than existing models, but also can be extended to support bimodal traffic distributions. The model is validated against detailed simulation of routing networks, over a variety of message size distribution and message lengths. In virtually all cases, the model accurately predicts both overall network throughput and average message latency to within 8%. Because the impact of long messages can be severe, we consider three techniques packetization, virtual lanes, and adaptive routing to alleviate their impact. Packetization reduces the blocking time by long messages, improving network performance in most cases. Virtual lanes and adaptive routing together provide sufficient routing freedom to eliminate much of the blocking, producing comparable or even superior performance to packetization. Together, all three techniques complement each other, providing robust performance over a variety of traffic mixes and message sizes. fl A preliminary version of some of this work appears in [31].

Reference-contexts: In these networks, channel coupling effects make performance quite sensitive to message size. To date, several studies have explored the performance impact of message size in cut-through or wormhole-routed networks <ref> [1, 22, 35] </ref>. These studies show that, as the message size increases, network performance is degraded because longer messages increase the coupling between buffer and channel resources. <p> Several studies have shown that the channel coupling increases with message length, reducing performance <ref> [1, 22, 35] </ref>. This suggests splitting large messages into short packets, packetization, as a means to improve network performance. Also, in any deterministically routed (single fixed path routing) system, long messages can block other traffic for a long time, increasing the variance in latency.

Reference-contexts: Since the order of servicing messages is determined independently of channel service time for waiting messages, a channel can be modeled as an infinite M/G/1 queue. Then, the blocking time at channel n i , b n i is calculated as follows <ref> [33, 5] </ref>: b n i = 1 where channel utilization rate is = n i s n i (2) and n i is the arrival rate of conflicting messages.

Reference-contexts: Both of these features relax the binding of messages to physical channels, reducing the intermessage interference due to shared resources (physical channels). Virtual lanes [16] or logical channels <ref> [7] </ref>, virtualize the physical channels, multiplexing them amongst several messages. The multiplexing allows other messages to pass a blocked message, decoupling their progress. Thus, virtual lanes reduce the performance loss due to the blockage. Adaptive routing allows messages to use any one of several paths from source to destination.

Reference-contexts: Our studies show that packetization reduces the performance impact of long messages on short significantly. However, packetization incurs substantial overheads for message fragmentation and reassembly. Our simulation studies show that multipath routing (virtual lanes [16] and adaptive routing <ref> [38, 20, 10] </ref>) can give similar benefits. Multipath routing allows short messages to pass through or circumvent channels tied up by long messages, giving comparable benefits to packetization with different hardware requirements. <p> This can allow one message to circumvent a blocked message, again, decoupling their progress. There are many varieties of adaptive routing algorithms which are deadlock-free in wormhole-routed networks. The adaptive router used in this paper is a planar-adaptive router, described in detail in <ref> [10] </ref>. However, its details are not important because our primary concern is how adaptivity in general affects the network performance under bimodal traffic loads. Previous studies show that virtual lanes and adaptive routing, can improve network performance [16, 29, 38] for uniformly-sized traffic. <p> Only when the fraction of long messages is very high, does packetization cause a loss in throughput. 7 Multipath Networks Multipath routing techniques such as adaptive routing and virtual lanes reduce intermessage interference by allowing messages to circumvent congestion. Adaptive routing allows packets to avoid congested areas <ref> [38, 10] </ref>, and virtual lanes [16, 6] allow blocked packets to relinquish a physical channel, allowing other packets to move ahead.

Reference-contexts: Third, typical message passing libraries implement some form of packetization, breaking long messages down into some maximum physical transfer size (256, 512, or 1024 bytes, typically). For instance, in the Symult 2010, messages longer than 256 bytes are sent as a series of 256 byte packets <ref> [11] </ref>. Such packetization eliminates extremely long messages and dramatically increases the number of messages at the maximum physical transfer size. Messages below the maximum transfer size are transmitted without fragmenting. Fourth, a variety of novel programming models seek to exploit parallelism at a finer granularity [9, 8, 12]. <p> We consider hardware support to be a requirement because performing packetization and reassembly in software not only degrades processor performance, it also increases communication latency. For example, Chittor and Enbody's studies showed packetization overheads (24.6 sec) for each packet, much larger than the typical routing delays (14.8 sec) <ref> [11] </ref>. 2 Second, packetization increases the network load; each packet must contain routing and sequencing information in its header. For smaller packet sizes, the overhead increases proportionally.

Reference-contexts: There are a number of factors which give rise to non-uniform message sizes. First, applications may generate a range of message sizes directly. Recent studies on a variety of applications <ref> [13, 24] </ref> demonstrate a wide range of message sizes from a few bytes to over 512 kilobytes at the application level. Second, protocols implemented by the message-passing libraries give rise to several distinct message sizes. Many synchronous message passing implementations implement a three-phase protocol to allocate buffer storage.

Reference-contexts: Network performance depends on a variety of factors, not only network architecture (topology, routing and flow control), but also the characteristics of communications that are actually carried on the network such as message sizes and traffic patterns. Many recent multicomputer networks use cut-through or wormhole routing <ref> [27, 14] </ref>, a technique which reduces message latency by pipelining transmission over the channels along a message's route. In these networks, a message spans multiple channels which couples the channels tightly together, so blockage on one channel can have immediate impact on another. <p> In contrast to previous multistage interconnection networks, their hierarchical topologies allow the exploitation of locality. Though these networks are also interesting, our studies focus primarily on direct networks, especially mesh-connected networks. Many of these networks use cut-through or wormhole routing <ref> [27, 14] </ref>, a technique which reduces message latency by pipelining its transmission over a number of channels along its path. The important distinction between the virtual cut-through routing and wormhole routing is the action taken when a message's path is blocked.

Our study explores their impact on the network performance under bimodal traffic loads, particularly focusing on network performance for short messages. 3 Methodology 3.1 Traffic model Actual multicomputer traffic loads are hybrid traffic loads messages of a variety of sizes. <p> In <ref> [16] </ref>, Dally approximates w 0 as n i (s n i ) 2 =2, ignoring the variance of the distribution. We have still two unknown variables in Eqs. (1) - (3): n i and s 2 n i , the second moment of channel service time. <p> Adaptive routing allows packets to avoid congested areas [38, 10], and virtual lanes <ref> [16, 6] </ref> allow blocked packets to relinquish a physical channel, allowing other packets to move ahead. <p> While the throughput curves for multipath networks look similar to those for non-packetizing DOR networks, the throughput is 20% - 60% higher. The reasons for this are twofold. First, virtual lanes and adaptive routing improve the network performance in general by reducing channel coupling in wormhole routed networks <ref> [16, 29] </ref>. Second, they also improve short message performance by eliminating interference of long messages on short ones.

Many of these networks use cut-through or wormhole routing <ref> [27, 14] </ref>, a technique which reduces message latency by pipelining its transmission over a number of channels along its path. The important distinction between the virtual cut-through routing and wormhole routing is the action taken when a message's path is blocked.

Reference-contexts: However, its details are not important because our primary concern is how adaptivity in general affects the network performance under bimodal traffic loads. Previous studies show that virtual lanes and adaptive routing, can improve network performance <ref> [16, 29, 38] </ref> for uniformly-sized traffic. Our study explores their impact on the network performance under bimodal traffic loads, particularly focusing on network performance for short messages. 3 Methodology 3.1 Traffic model Actual multicomputer traffic loads are hybrid traffic loads messages of a variety of sizes. <p> While the throughput curves for multipath networks look similar to those for non-packetizing DOR networks, the throughput is 20% - 60% higher. The reasons for this are twofold. First, virtual lanes and adaptive routing improve the network performance in general by reducing channel coupling in wormhole routed networks <ref> [16, 29] </ref>. Second, they also improve short message performance by eliminating interference of long messages on short ones.

Reference-contexts: Since the order of servicing messages is determined independently of channel service time for waiting messages, a channel can be modeled as an infinite M/G/1 queue. Then, the blocking time at channel n i , b n i is calculated as follows <ref> [33, 5] </ref>: b n i = 1 where channel utilization rate is = n i s n i (2) and n i is the arrival rate of conflicting messages.

Reference-contexts: In these networks, channel coupling effects make performance quite sensitive to message size. To date, several studies have explored the performance impact of message size in cut-through or wormhole-routed networks <ref> [1, 22, 35] </ref>. These studies show that, as the message size increases, network performance is degraded because longer messages increase the coupling between buffer and channel resources. <p> Several studies have shown that the channel coupling increases with message length, reducing performance <ref> [1, 22, 35] </ref>. This suggests splitting large messages into short packets, packetization, as a means to improve network performance. Also, in any deterministically routed (single fixed path routing) system, long messages can block other traffic for a long time, increasing the variance in latency.

Reference-contexts: Our studies show that packetization reduces the performance impact of long messages on short significantly. However, packetization incurs substantial overheads for message fragmentation and reassembly. Our simulation studies show that multipath routing (virtual lanes [16] and adaptive routing <ref> [38, 20, 10] </ref>) can give similar benefits. Multipath routing allows short messages to pass through or circumvent channels tied up by long messages, giving comparable benefits to packetization with different hardware requirements. <p> However, its details are not important because our primary concern is how adaptivity in general affects the network performance under bimodal traffic loads.

Reference-contexts: A message's service time of a channel is assumed to be statistically independent of its blocking time. Each channel is approximated as a M/G/1 queue with the service time of Weibull distribution <ref> [40] </ref> (a 8 generalized exponential distribution). The better-known exponential distribution is inadequate to model the large variance for a given average of channel service time in wormhole-routed networks. <p> From this picture, it is clear why exponential-based models have significant inaccuracies they must compromise on the mean or the variance. To reflect the large variance of channel service time in wormhole-routed networks, we use a generalized exponential distribution, called Weibull distribution <ref> [40] </ref>. which provides a range of distri 11 (a) (c) mesh networks of (a) 64 nodes, (b) 256 nodes and (c) 1024 nodes. For each network size, channel service time is measured at two different load rates.
