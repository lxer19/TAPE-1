Abstract: Parallel video servers are necessary for large-scale video-on-demand and other multimedia systems. This paper addresses the scheduling problem of parallel video servers. We discuss scheduling requirements. Optimal algorithms are presented for conflict-free scheduling, delay minimization, load balancing, and admission control.

Reference-contexts: Most research works assumed single disk storage system. Several research projects investigated the design techniques for parallel video servers [11, 3, 9, 14, 10]. Video data striping schemes have been studied <ref> [11, 1, 4, 7] </ref>. However, video stream scheduling problem has not been formally addressed. The system resources cannot be fully utilized without a sophisticated scheduling strategy. Not arranging the video streams properly, large buffer space is required. In particular, the prefetch technique requests huge memory space [6].

Reference-contexts: Thus, applying the perfect matching algorithm m times, a schedule for all time slots can be generated. 2 The perfect matching algorithm, so called the Hungarian method, can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. Here 5 6 we give a brief description of the algorithm. Start with an arbitrary matching M . If M is not a perfect matching yet, an M -unsaturated node u is chosen. We search for an M -augmenting path with origin u to construct a larger matching.

Reference-contexts: A number of works describe clustered systems [14, 10, 11].

In this paper, we evaluate scheduling strategies for the clustered architecture. Figure 1 shows a diagram of clustered video servers. The storage nodes, each with a local disk array, are responsible for storing video data in some storage medium, such as disks. <p> Related issues include disk layout and scheduling strategies, admission control strategies, real-time support, etc. [4, 7, 12, 15, 5].

According to the marriage theorem <ref> [8] </ref>, if G is a k-regular bipartite graph with k &gt; 0, then G has a perfect matching.

Reference-contexts: The data to be retrieved is sent to the memory buffer through a high-speed network or bus, and then to the clients. A mass storage system has presented the capacity of supporting hundreds of video streams <ref> [9] </ref>. However, it is not clear yet that a multiprocessor video server can be scalable. A clustered architecture is easy to scale to thousands server nodes.

The optimal block size is around 256 KBytes to 512 KBytes <ref> [11, 14, 9] </ref>, and an MPEG-2 compressed video rate is about 0:5MBytes/sec.

Reference-contexts: In the case that the total number of requests is more than N m, only N m requests can be fulfilled. Many existing algorithms can be applied to this problem. The objective is to move video streams from those overloaded nodes to the underloaded nodes with minimal cost. RIPS <ref> [13] </ref>, runtime incremental parallel scheduling, is a load-balancing algorithm designed and used to balance independent tasks on large-scale parallel machines. The algorithm can be so modified for parallel video servers that every node that presently handles more than m requests will send excess load to its nearest underloaded nodes.
