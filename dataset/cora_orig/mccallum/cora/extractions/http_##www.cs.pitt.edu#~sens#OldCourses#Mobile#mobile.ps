Reference-contexts: In their protocol Acharya and Badrinath <ref> [AB94] </ref> describe a scheme where checkpoints are stored at a fixed Mobility Support Station (MSS) and this information is passed along with the Dependency Vectors. This bypasses any search and inform cost since hosts know where to look for checkpoints. <p> The actual values assigned to these parameters for the purposes of our simulation study are shown in Table 2. Experiment 1: A Location Management Optimization The distributed algorithm <ref> [AB94] </ref> proposed by Acharya and Badrinath requires that a checkpoint be taken every time a MH changes location. This is due to the fact the the authors are interested in reducing the search/inform cost.
