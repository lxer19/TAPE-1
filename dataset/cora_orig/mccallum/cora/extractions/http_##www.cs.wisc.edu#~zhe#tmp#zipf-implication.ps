Abstract: Recently, a number of studies on characteristics of Web proxy traces have shown that the hit-ratios of the traces exhibit certain properties that are uniform across the different sets of the traces [CI97, RV98, DMF97, GB97, KLM97]. An explanation for these phenomena has eluded researchers and it is not clear whether the properties are inherent to Web accesses or particular to the set of traces studied. In this paper, we show that if one assumes that the references in the Web access stream are independent and the reference probability of the documents follow Zipf's law then the observed properties follow from Zipf's law. We revisit Web cache replacement algorithms and show that the algorithm that is suggested by Zipf's law performs best. Finally, we investigate the drift in the cache's hot set as a function of time.

Clearly our model has limitations. First, the model does not consider the cache's replacement policy, which no doubt plays a critical role in a cache's performance. Second, Zipf's law over-constrains the request probability function as P (i) = i ff where ff = 1.

In practice, an online algorithm detects those documents by keeping track of the number of references to each document and keeping those documents with the highest reference count in the cache. In other words, the best online algorithm under the independent reference model is the Least-Frequently-Used (LFU) algorithm.
