Abstract: Current research efforts focus on providing more effective and efficient methods which may increase the current range of shapes available for solid modeling. In this paper a new interactive technique for deforming three-dimensional objects is presented. Free-form deformation (FFD) is a powerful deformation modeling tool. Controlling the shape of an object under complex deformations is often difficult using this method. Extended free-form deformation (EFFD) is another deformation tool that permits the user to have more control of the deformation, but he must know the general shape of the desired deformation before modeling. Both tools require the user to interact with a large number of control points in order to complete the complex deformation of an object.

Reference-contexts: Techniques allowing a user to develop complex objects, which are intuitive and easy to use, are highly desired for such systems. In the past decade several methods have been developed to create complex models. Barr <ref> [1] </ref> introduced fl Computer Science Dept, Room 225AS, Santa Cruz CA 95064, USA. E-mail ajjoseph@cse.ucsc.edu geometric modeling deformations. These global deformations (twisting, tapering, and bending) provide abstract data manipulation operators that form a useful sculpting metaphor. <p> The majority of the work related to this topic deals with freeform deformation (FFD) or some variation thereof. The deformations introduced by Alan Barr <ref> [1] </ref> are highly intuitive and are an easily visualized set of operations. <p> This shows how the bounding box may be positioned and scaled to fit any desired region of the object to be deformed. 3.2 Global Deformations The global deformations used in this technique are the basic ones described by Barr in <ref> [1] </ref>. The following briefly explains each type of deformation the user may choose from. A globally specified deformation of a three-dimensional solid is a mathematical function F which explicitly modifies the global coordinates of points in space. <p> The global deformations described above may be adjusted so they can be applied as transformations around another axis. They can also be combined in succession to form more complex deformed objects. The fully developed details of global deformations can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. LGD transforms vertices of polygonal data using these global deformations while maintaining polygon connectivity. 3.3 Deforming a object Using the global deformation techniques described above, an area of the object is deformed according to the transformation chosen by the user.

Reference-contexts: Both FFD and EFFD are effective methods for deforming objects, but minimal human intervention is most desired in a deformation modeling tool. 2.2 Techniques using deformation Many papers ([5], [6], <ref> [2] </ref>) discuss techniques that would help to make a user's interaction with a modeling tool simple, yet allow them to model complex objects. Gudukay and Ozguc [5] present a system that uses both FFDs and regular (global) deformations to model a complex object. <p> The authors found that FFD can allow a user to create complex deformations on an object, but regular deformations give predictable results that are not guaranteed with FFDs, a feature that may prove to be useful when modeling. Comninos <ref> [2] </ref> presented a method to reduce the computational requirements of current FFD methods and increase their user friendliness and flexibility. This paper discusses using other polynomial bases, besides trivariate Bernstein polynomials for FFD,which introduces local control and local tension parameter.

Reference-contexts: Sederberg and Parry ([8],[9]) introduced a deformation technique that is used to redefine an area of a solid geometric model. Free-form deformation (FFD) allows a user to create a deformation in a local or global manner, that may not be obtained with global deformation. Coquillart's <ref> [3] </ref> deformation technique is an extension of FFDs that provides a highly interactive and intuitive modeling technique. Extended free-form deformation (EFFD) provides the user with a slightly more intuitive manner in which to control object deformations which may not be obtained using FFD. <p> Free-form deformation (FFD) allows the deformation of solid geometric models of any type and degree in a free-form manner. FFD allows deformations to be applied locally or globally, but arbitrarily shape deformations (those not from a parallelepipedical shape) are prohibited. Coquillart <ref> [3] </ref> presents an extension of FFD. Extended free-form deformation (EFFD) permits arbitrarily shaped bumps to be designed and surfaces may be bent along various shaped curves. The user is able to create diverse deformed objects, with the use of non-parallelepipedical lattices.

Reference-contexts: Extended free-form deformation (EFFD) provides the user with a slightly more intuitive manner in which to control object deformations which may not be obtained using FFD. These modeling deformation tools have proved to be useful in the area of geometric modeling and in the area of animation ([7], <ref> [4] </ref>). In this paper, an new interactive technique for deforming geometric models is presented. The technique may be used to redefine an area of a solid geometric model, as seen using FFD, but little human intervention is needed.
