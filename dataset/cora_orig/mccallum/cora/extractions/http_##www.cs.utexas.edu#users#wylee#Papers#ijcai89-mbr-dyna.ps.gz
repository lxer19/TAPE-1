Abstract: This paper describes a method for deriving diagnostic knowledge from models of a continuous-variable dynamic system. The method combines qualitative simulation of fault models with inductive learning to produce compact diagnostic rules in the form of a decision tree whose nodes correspond to features of dynamic behavior and whose construction is influenced not only by the information gain of features but also by: (1) the observability of features, (2) the a priori probabilities of faults, and (3) the historical probabilities of behaviors. The learned diagnostic knowledge is suited for use in process monitoring, where several system parameters are continually monitored, some can be manually measured, and the others are not observable.

Reference-contexts: In some domains, double-fault models may be adequate. In some medical domains the number of realistic fault combinations is tractable since most of the combinations are physiologically impossible or medically uninteresting <ref> [Bratko et al., 1986] </ref>. 7 New landmarks created during simulation of two different models are considered equivalent if their semantics are equivalent. <p> Classifying this behavior resulted in seven hypotheses plus the ranked measurement set fError-qdir HFin-qmagg. When Error-qdir (the top-ranked feature-to-be-measured) was measured and included in the next observation, the classifier found decoupled-temperature-sensor as the only fault hy pothesis. 9 Conclusions and Future Work Inspired by the work of <ref> [Bratko et al., 1986] </ref> and [Pearce, 1988], we have extended the technique of inducing diagnostic knowledge from qualitative models to cover continuous-variable dynamic systems.

Reference-contexts: In addition, a qualitative model can represent incomplete and/or imprecise knowledge of a mechanism (a fact of life in many situations, such as medical models). We use the Qsim <ref> [Kuipers, 1986] </ref> method for qualitative/quantitative representation and simulation of dynamic systems. Just as modern control theory represents a dynamic system as a set of coupled first-order differential equations, Qsim represents a dynamic system as a set of coupled first-order qualitative differential equations (QDEs), where each QDE is a constraint.

Reference-contexts: Currently, DynaLearn uses only qualitative observations. However, in process monitoring, sensor readings are frequently quantitative observations, and it would be advantageous to exploit this available quantitative information. Since Qsim is capable of reasoning with partial quantitative knowledge <ref> [Kuipers and Berleant, 1987] </ref>, it should be possible to augment the learned diagnostic knowledge with numerical ranges. This includes numerical ranges on time, which means that diagnosis can be further strengthened by recognizing events that occur too early or too late.

Reference-contexts: Originally described by Bratko et al. [1986] for learning from qualitative models, the technique consists of three steps | fault-model construction, simulation, and rule induction | to obtain operational diagnostic knowledge of the form syndrome ) fault. This work extends the work of <ref> [Pearce, 1988] </ref> to time-varying systems, much along lines he envisioned. 2 Dynamic Qualitative Models Fault model simulations provide the raw data for the inductive learner. These simulations must reveal the system's time-varying behavior and all of its qualitatively distinct behaviors. <p> When Error-qdir (the top-ranked feature-to-be-measured) was measured and included in the next observation, the classifier found decoupled-temperature-sensor as the only fault hy pothesis. 9 Conclusions and Future Work Inspired by the work of [Bratko et al., 1986] and <ref> [Pearce, 1988] </ref>, we have extended the technique of inducing diagnostic knowledge from qualitative models to cover continuous-variable dynamic systems.

Reference-contexts: The questions, then, are how to model a CVDS and how to derive the diagnostic knowledge suitable for process monitoring. This paper describes DynaLearn, a program in which we model a CVDS using dynamic qualitative model and induce a decision tree 1 using an algorithm similar to ID3 <ref> [Quinlan, 1986] </ref>. Originally described by Bratko et al. [1986] for learning from qualitative models, the technique consists of three steps | fault-model construction, simulation, and rule induction | to obtain operational diagnostic knowledge of the form syndrome ) fault. <p> Induction. The training set is compressed by an inductive learning program to a smaller body of operational diagnostic knowledge in the form of a decision tree. We use an algorithm (to be described in section 6) which is similar to ID3 <ref> [Quinlan, 1986] </ref> but designed around the criteria listed in section 4, As Davis and Hamscher [1988] note, the fault dictionary approach to diagnosis involves a tradeoff among coverage, resolution, and efficiency. 6 Building the Decision Tree ID3 is a member of a family of machine learning systems that perform top-down induction
