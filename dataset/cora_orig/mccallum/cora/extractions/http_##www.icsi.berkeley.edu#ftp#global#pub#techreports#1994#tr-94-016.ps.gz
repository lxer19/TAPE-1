Abstract: We study the following problem: given x 2 IR n either find a short integer relation m 2 ZZ n ; so that &lt; x; m &gt;= 0 holds for the inner product &lt; : ; : &gt; ; or prove that no short integer relation exists for x: Hastad, Just, Lagarias and Schnorr (1989) give a polynomial time algorithm for this problem. We present a stable variation of the HJLS-algorithm that preserves lower bounds on (x) for infinitesimal changes of x: Given x 2 IR n and ff 2 IN this algorithm finds a nearby point x 0 and a short integer relation m for x 0 : The nearby point x 0 is 'good' in the sense that no very short relation exists for points x within half the x 0 -distance from x: On the other hand if x 0 = x then m is, up to a factor 2 n=2 ; a shortest integer relation for x: Our algorithm uses, for arbitrary real input x; at most O(n 4 (n + log ff)) many arithmetical operations on real numbers. If x is rational the algorithm operates on integers having at most O(n 5 + n 3 (log ff) 2 + log(kqxk 2 )) many bits where q is the common denominator for x.

Reference-contexts: The first polynomial time algorithm, which for arbitrary real x produces a 'good' lower bound for (x) has been designed by Hastad, Just, Lagarias and Schnorr <ref> [HJLS89] </ref>. <p> a real number r ; drc =br + 0:5c : Let [b 1 ; : : : ; b n ] denote the matrix with column vectors b 1 ; : : : ; b n . 3 The method of the HJLS-algorithm The HJLS-algorithm relies on Proposition 3.1 of <ref> [HJLS89] </ref> which states that (x) 1= max k b b i;x k (1) holds for every basis b 1 ; : : : ; b n of the lattice ZZ n . This inequality already appears in somewhat weaker form in [FF79]. <p> Proof sketch. The number of arithmetic operations of the algorithm is about n times that of the HJLS-algorithm, see Theorem 3.2 of <ref> [HJLS89] </ref>. The additional factor n is for the size-reduction in step 2.3. <p> Proof. 3. If x 0 = x then b b n;x 6= 0 and thus m = a n is an integer relation for x by Proposition 3.1 of <ref> [HJLS89] </ref>. The same proposition shows that the length of a n is at most 2 n=2 1 minf (x); ffg : 1. The inequality k m k 2 O (n 4 (log ff) 2 ) follows from Proposition 2. <p> = b b n 6= 0 which implies &lt; a n ; x 0 &gt;= 0 : The equality a n = b b n k b b n k 2 follows from &lt; a n ; x 0 &gt;= 0 =&lt; obin; x 0 &gt;; see Proposition 3.1 of <ref> [HJLS89] </ref>. 2.

Just <ref> [Ju92] </ref> analyzes diophantine approximations obtained by a variant of the HJLS-algorithm on inputs of the special form x = (x 1 ; : : : ; x n1 ; 1) 2 IR n . <p> Her algorithm is the HJLS-algorithm with full reduction in size so that, before swapping 9 b k1 ; b k , size-reduction is performed on the vector b k with respect to b k1 ; : : : ; b 1 : Formula (17), <ref> [Ju92] </ref> shows that the final basis b 1 ; : : : ; b n ( and every basis in the algorithm that precedes a swap of the last two vectors b n ; b n1 ) satisfies with b 1 = (p 1 ; : : :; p n1 ; <p> : : : ; b n ( and every basis in the algorithm that precedes a swap of the last two vectors b n ; b n1 ) satisfies with b 1 = (p 1 ; : : :; p n1 ; q) max jx i q Moreover Theorem 7, <ref> [Ju92] </ref> bounds the error of the diophantine approximation as max jx i q 2 (n+2)=4 kxk This algorithmic result must be compared with the existential bound of Hermite, where the right hand side of inequality (9) is kxk=jqj 1+1=(n1) . <p> On the other hand the coefficients k;j with j &lt; s and the vectors b 1 ,...,b m , a 1 ,...,a s1 may become very large if x is irrational. This point requires further study. Our algorithm with full size-reduction in step 2.3 distinguishes from the algorithm in <ref> [Ju92] </ref> only in that we use the Lovasz exchange rule whereas Bergman's exchange rule is used in [Ju92] and in the HJLS-algorithm. 3. <p> This point requires further study.

Reference-contexts: Lagarias has shown that diophantine approximations can be constructed by the L 3 -algorithm for lattice basis reduction so that the right hand side in (9) is 2 n=2 n=jqj 1+1=(n1) <ref> [La83] </ref>. However this result does not use a continued fraction type algorithm. 2. The analysis of Just does not apply directly to our polynomial time algorithm, and the Just algorithm is not polynomial time.
