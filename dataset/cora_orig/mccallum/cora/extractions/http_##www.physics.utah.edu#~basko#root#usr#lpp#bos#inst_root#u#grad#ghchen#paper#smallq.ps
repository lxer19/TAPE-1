Abstract: We study the static dielectric function "(q) of 2D electron system with spin-orbit coupling in the frame of the random phase approximation. We demonstrate that, in addition to the well-known 2k F -Kohn anomaly, spin-orbit coupling gives rise to the novel anomaly at small q = q 0 t k F , where q 0 is the distance between two Fermi surfaces. The oscillations of the potential from a point charge resulting from this anomaly are studied. The remarkable feature of these oscillations is that they are not smeared out by the temperature.
