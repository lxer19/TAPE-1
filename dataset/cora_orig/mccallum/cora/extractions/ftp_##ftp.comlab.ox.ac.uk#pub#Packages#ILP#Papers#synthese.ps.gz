Title: Deduction, Induction and Probabilistic Support  
Author: James Cussens 
Abstract: Elementary results concerning the connections between deductive relations and probabilistic support are given. These are used to show that Popper-Miller's result is a special case of a more general result, and that their result is not "very unexpected" as claimed. According to Popper-Miller, a purely inductively supports b only if they are "deductively independent"|but this means that :a ` b. Hence, it is argued that viewing induction as occurring only in the absence of deductive relations, as Popper-Miller sometimes do, is untenable. Finally, it is shown that Popper-Miller's claim that deductive relations determine probabilistic support is untrue. In general, probabilistic support can vary greatly with fixed deductive relations as determined by the relevant Lindenbaum algebra.

Reference-contexts: Eells <ref> (Eells, 1988) </ref> has already cast serious doubt on the thesis that all probabilistic support is deductive in nature. <p> Purely deductive support does not come in degrees. <ref> (Eells, 1988) </ref> One of the central claims of PM is that probabilistic support is determined by deductive dependence, as measured by the overlap of consequence classes. To be able to examine this claim it is necessary to allow that deductive support may occur in degrees.

Reference-contexts: This is sufficient to refute the claim that deductive relations determine probabilistic support. This is essentially the same argument used by Howson <ref> (Howson, 1973) </ref>, when criticising Popper's claim that the `logical' probability of universal laws is always zero. It might be argued that a given probability measure implicitly assumes certain deductive relations between the elements of the algebra on which it is defined.

Reference-contexts: It is then simple to show that s (h e; e) &lt; 0 so long as p (h; e) &lt; 1 and p (e) &lt; 1. This is the core of PM's argument that probabilistic support derives from deductive relations. Jeffrey <ref> (Jeffrey, 1984) </ref> criticises this argument, using the example of h = e ^ f . f is part of h that does not follow deductively from e and yet is not contained in h e (h e 6` f with h ` f and e 6` f ).

Reference-contexts: An immediate corollary is that inductive (i.e. non-deductive) probabilistic support does not exist. All probabilistic support is deductive. 1 It is not my intention to give an account of the ensuing controversy, the interested reader is referred to <ref> (Mura, 1990) </ref>, which contains a list of the relevant papers. There is also a detailed survey in (Cussens, 1991). Instead, I will focus on two points. First, I identify and take issue with the concept of `induction' employed by PM. <p> The usual complaint is that for a proposition to `go beyond' evidence e, it is not necessary for it to 6 be deductively independent of e, in the sense defined above. It also accounts for the superficially puzzling remark of Miller (quoted in <ref> (Mura, 1990) </ref>) that the prediction h = `The sun will rise tomorrow.' is not itself `about' the future; indeed, it consists of a conjunction of a sentence `about' the past and a sentence countersupported by the evidence.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The publication of the paper, A Proof of the Impossibility of Inductive Probability by Popper and Miller <ref> (Popper and Miller, 1983) </ref>, marked the beginning of a vigorous debate on the relationship between deductive relations and probabilistic support.

Reference-contexts: As PM put it "we find that what is left of h once we discard from it everything that is logically implied by e, is a proposition that in general is counterdependent on e" <ref> (Popper and Miller, 1987) </ref>. This observation constitutes PM's "main thesis". Their argument involves a consideration of the consequence classes of propositions. For PM, 2 the deductive relations between two propositions are contained in the total-ity of logical implications between elements of their consequence classes. <p> Theorem 2.9 If a and b are deductively independent and p (b) &gt; 0 then s (a; b) = p (a; b) p (a) = = 0 if p (a) = 1 or p (b) = 1 &lt; 0 otherwise (This result is a direct consequence of Theorem 1 in <ref> (Popper and Miller, 1987) </ref>.) Proof of 2.9 If p (b) = 1 then it follows trivially that s (a; b) = 0, so from now on assume that p (b) &lt; 1, or equivalently that p (:b) &gt; 0. <p> The result then follows from Theorem 2.9. 2 We can now apply the general results above to the specifics of the Popper-Miller argument. PM note that h e is "what is left of h once we discard from it everything that is logically implied by e" <ref> (Popper and Miller, 1987) </ref>. In other words Cn (h e) is the class of consequences of h that are not deductively dependent on e, in particular h e is deductively independent of e. <p> Now it follows from Theorem 2.9 that s (h e; e) &lt; 0 unless p (h) = 1 or p (e) = 1, in which case s (h e; e) = 0. PM state that this is a "very unexpected result" <ref> (Popper and Miller, 1987) </ref>, but surely the result is not surprising, since :(h e) ` e. <p> If there is such a thing as pure inductive dependence at all, there seems nothing for it but to measure it by something like s (h e; e) or d (h e; e). <ref> (Popper and Miller, 1987) </ref> 1 d (a; b) = p (a ^ b) p (a)p (b), a function closely related to covariance. We will not examine this function in the present paper. 5 There are two problems with this focus on pure inductive support. <p> However, it is clear that there is a big difference between pure inductive support, as defined by PM, and inductive support as it is usually conceived (by inductivists, for example). The latter conception is given by Pierce, who is quoted by PM <ref> (Popper and Miller, 1987) </ref>, where he characterises "amplifative, synthetic, or (loosely speaking) inductive" reasoning occuring when "the facts summed up in the conclusion are not amongst those stated in the premisses". It is clear that these two conceptions of inductive inference are not coextensive. <p> It is clear that these two conceptions of inductive inference are not coextensive. Recall Jeffrey's example, as reported in Section 2.1. On the PM view, "the `ampliative' part of h relative to e was identified with this conditional h e" <ref> (Popper and Miller, 1987) </ref> and f is not an ampliative part of h relative to e, because e and f are, in general, deductively dependent. <p> Can Deductive Relations Explain Proba bilistic Support? PM claim that Although evidence may raise the probability of a hypothesis above the value it achieves on background knowledge alone, every such increase in probability has to be attributed entirely to the deductive connections that exist between the hypothesis and the evidence. <ref> (Popper and Miller, 1987) </ref> Now it is clear that PM have given a necessary condition for the existence of (positive) probabilistic support: s (a; b) &gt; 0 implies a and b are deductively dependent, or, equivalently, :a ` b ) s (a; b) 0. <p> support functions (h; e) = p (h; e)=p (h) and s (h; e) = p (h; e) p (h), they state: The measure , no less than the measure s, sustains the view that differences in probabilistic support are to be attributed entirely to differences in degrees of deductive dependence. <ref> (Popper and Miller, 1987) </ref> However, any claim that the extent of probabilistic support is determined by deductive relations is demonstrably false as we shall now show. Eells (Eells, 1988) has already cast serious doubt on the thesis that all probabilistic support is deductive in nature.
