Title: Ps in a Pod: some recipes for cooking Mendels data

Abstract: In 1936 R.A.Fisher asked the pointed question, Has Mendels Work Been Rediscovered? The query was intended to open for discussion whether someone altered the data in Gregor Mendels classic 1866 research report on the garden pea, Experiments in Plant-Hybridization. Fisher concluded, reluctantly, that the statistical counts in Mendels paper were doctored in order to create a better intuitive fit between Mendelian expected values and observed frequencies. That verdict remains the received view at least among statisticians, so I believe. Fishers analysis is a tour de force of socalled Goodness of Fit statistical tests using c 2 to calculate significance levels, i.e., P-values. In this paper I attempt a defense of Mendels report, based on several themes. (1) Mendels experiments include some important sequential design features that Fisher and (to my knowledge) others ignore. This is relevant to Fishers charge that, for one crucial experiment, Mendels protocol had approximately a 5% error of misclassifying hybrids as pure dominants. (2) Fisher uses particular statistical techniques of Meta-analysis for pooling outcomes from different experiments. These methods are subject to critical debate. and (3) I speculate on a small modification to Mendelian theory for the model of self-fertilization of garden pea that offers some relief from Fishers harsh conclusion that, overall, Mendels data are too good to be true. This last idea is yet another try to find an empirically plausible reason for thinking that Mendels pea data should reflect sub-binomial variability.
