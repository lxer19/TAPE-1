Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to examine the problem of controlling a linear discrete-time system subject to input saturation in order to have its output track (or reject) a family of reference (or disturbance) signals produced by some external generator. It is shown that a semi-global framework, rather than a global framework, for this problem is a natural one. Within this framework, a set of solvability conditions are given and feedback laws which solve the problem are constructed. The theory developed in this paper parallels the one we developed earlier for the continuous-time system [10].

Reference-contexts: In this case, although the controller has a linear structure, it has some nonlinearity due to input saturation. We introduce the notion of semi-global output regulation problems by extending the output regulator theory for linear systems in the absence of input saturation developed by several authors (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref> and [19]) to linear systems subject to input saturation which are asymptotically null controllable with bounded controls. A set of solvability conditions for these problems is provided and it is shown that for a fairly general class of systems these conditions are necessary. <p> For all (x (0); z (0); w (0)) 2 R n+l+s , the solution of (2.5) satisfies lim k!1 e (k) = 0. The solution of these two problems (see <ref> [1] </ref>) is based on the following three assumptions: A1. The eigenvalues of S are on or outside the unit circle. A2. The pair (A; B) is stabilizable. A3. The pair ([ C Q ] ; 0 S ) is detectable. <p> The third one is stronger than the assumption of detectability of the pair (C; A), that would be necessary for the asymptotic stabilization of the closed loop via error feedback, but again does not involve loss of generality, as discussed in detail by Francis in <ref> [1] </ref>. In fact, if the pair (C; A) is detectable and A3 does not hold, it is always possible to reduce the dimension of the exosystem which actually affects the error, and have on the reduced system thus obtained condition A3 satisfied.
