Title: A Multiple Baseline Stereo Camera System  
Author: Kari Pulli 
Date: June 4, 1995  
Abstract: This report describes the multiple baseline stereo camera system under construction at the University of Washington. The current status that most of the hardware is already working, and independant pieces of software are also working. However, the system does not work yet as a whole.

Reference-contexts: One could then populate virtual worlds by copies of real world objects and locations. 1.2 Background material Of the large amount of papers and publications that I have used as background material I will present three. The book "Three-Dimensional Computer Vision" by Faugeras <ref> [1] </ref> is a wonderful book that covers a wide variety of Computer Vision methods. It has a solid mathematical background in projective geometry, which is used to derive solutions and descriptions to several vision problems. Especially useful for this project were the chapters on camera calibration and stereo vision systems. <p> and using VC++ and MFC for creating graph ical user interfaces for Windows applications. * Operating video cameras with a PC programming interface. * Video camera calibration, both for single cameras and a stereo camera system. * Projective geometry (I needed to study this so I could better understand Faugeras' <ref> [1] </ref> book). * Got practise in writing image processing routines for edge detection and in efficient implementation of Hough transform, as well as in special case of model based matching (locating the point pattern from Hough parameter space peaks).

Reference-contexts: An own scanner would facilitate the testing of reconstruction algorithm and force us to face the problems of obtaining useful real-world data. The Robotics Institute of the Carnegie Mellon University has been working a few years with a stereo vision method based on multiple cameras <ref> [2] </ref>, [3]. Traditional two camera stereo systems, which are based on calculating distances using triangulation, have the inherent tradeoff of accuracy (large baseline is useful) and difficulty of matching parts of images corresponding to same surface points (short baseline helps). <p> It has a solid mathematical background in projective geometry, which is used to derive solutions and descriptions to several vision problems. Especially useful for this project were the chapters on camera calibration and stereo vision systems. The paper "A Multiple-Baseline Stereo Method" by Kanade et al. <ref> [2] </ref> describes both the theory behind this stereo camera system and a set of experiments both using laboratory scale models and outdoor scene experiments. As in most stereo systems, the idea is to find the points in the camera images that correspond to the same physical surface points.

The appendix "Depth from stereo" shows the geometry for this triangulation. <p> Hence the SSSD shows a unique global minimum at the correct distance. The paper "An active multibaseline stereo system with real-time image acquisition by Kang et al. <ref> [3] </ref> describes what has been done at CMU on this method since the previous paper. 2 The paper describes some more on the camera calibration methods that is used. The paper also shows that now active lighting is used.
