Abstract: A self-organizing neural network model for the simultaneous and cooperative development of topographic receptive fields and lateral interactions in cortical maps is presented. Both afferent and lateral connections adapt by the same Hebbian mechanism in a purely local and unsupervised learning process. Afferent input weights of each neuron self-organize into hill-shaped profiles, receptive fields organize topographically across the network, and unique lateral interaction profiles develop for each neuron. The model demonstrates how patterned lateral connections develop based on correlated activity, and explains why lateral connection patterns closely follow receptive field properties such as ocular dominance.

Reference-contexts: primarily connect areas with similar response properties, such as columns with the same orientation or (in the strabismic case) eye preference (Gilbert 1992; L owel and Singer 1992). (4) The lateral connections are far more numerous than the afferents and are believed to have a substantial influence on cortical activity <ref> (Gilbert et al.1990) </ref>. To fully account for cortical self-organization, a cortical map model must demonstrate that both afferent and lateral connections can organize simultaneously, from the same external input, and in a mutually supportive manner.

Reference-contexts: The crucial question is whether afferent stimulation produces mainly excitatory or inhibitory lateral responses at long range. Partial experimental support for long-range inhibition comes from optical imaging studies, which indicate that substantial lateral inhibition exists even at distances of up to 6mm in the primary visual cortex <ref> (Grinvald et al. 1994) </ref>. This range coincides well with the extent of long-range horizontal connections. Other studies such as that of Nelson and Frost (1978) have also reported long-range inhibitory interactions without clearly identifying the anatomical substrate.

Reference-contexts: However, binocular neurons, located between ocular dominance columns, retained connections to both eye regions. The ocular dominance stripes in the strabismics were broad and sharply defined <ref> (L owel 1994) </ref>. In contrast, ocular dominance stripes in normal animals were narrow and less sharply defined, and lateral connection patterns overall were not significantly influenced by ocular dominance. <p> If the range is less, activity patterns often split up into several separate bubbles, and distorted maps form. The weak long-range connections may be repeatedly pruned away during self-organization, as in the previous LISSOM model <ref> (Sirosh and Miikkulainen 1994) </ref>. By weight normalization, such pruning will increase the strength of the surviving connections, thereby increasing the inhibition between the correlated areas. <p> The crucial question is whether afferent stimulation produces mainly excitatory or inhibitory lateral responses at long range.
