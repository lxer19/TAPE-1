Title: Quadratic Dynamical Systems (Preliminary Version)  
Author: Yuri Rabinovich Alistair Sinclair Avi Wigderson 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to promote the study of computational aspects, primarily the convergence rate, of nonlinear dynamical systems from a combinatorial perspective. We identify the class of symmetric quadratic systems. Such systems have been widely used to model phenomena in the natural sciences, and also provide an appropriate framework for the study of genetic algorithms in combinatorial optimisation. We prove several fundamental general properties of these systems, including a characterisation of the set of fixed points to which the system converges. We go on to give a detailed analysis of a quadratic system defined in a natural way on probability distributions over the set of matchings in a graph. In particular, we prove that convergence to the limit requires only polynomial time when the graph is a tree. This result demonstrates that such systems, though nonlinear, are amenable to quantitative analysis.

Reference-contexts: In particular, there has been a recent upsurge of interest in algorithmic applications of artificial Markov chains in Computer Science, spurred by the development of new tools for analysing the rate of convergence. Examples include probabilistic algorithms for approximate counting [6, 10], pseudo-random number generators <ref> [1] </ref> and "simulated annealing" type algorithms for combinatorial optimisation [9, 10, 15]. For nonlinear systems, in stark contrast, there are almost no global convergence rate bounds available (but see [3]).

Reference-contexts: A population p is then simply the number of individuals of each type. The map f determines the population in the next generation according to a fixed set of rules that includes the genetic outcome of mating, the survival capacity of different types, random mutations etc. <ref> [2] </ref>. A completely different biological example describes the ecological coexistence of different species.

Reference-contexts: Examples include probabilistic algorithms for approximate counting [6, 10], pseudo-random number generators [1] and "simulated annealing" type algorithms for combinatorial optimisation [9, 10, 15]. For nonlinear systems, in stark contrast, there are almost no global convergence rate bounds available (but see <ref> [3] </ref>). We now identify a class of nonlinear systems known as symmetric quadratic systems, and argue that they capture several natural and artificial phenomena for which obtaining convergence rate information is computationally important.

Reference-contexts: To do this, we consider the information divergence, defined for distributions p; q on N by D (pjjq) = P i2N p i lg (p i =q i ) ; note that D (pjjq) 0 , with equality iff p = q . By the well-known relationship (see, e.g., <ref> [4, page 58] </ref>) between variation distance and information divergence, it suffices to show that D (p (t)jj) tends to zero as t ! 1 .

Reference-contexts: The system evolves under a fixed map f , which attempts to capture the underlying phenomenon. We mention below a few examples; for a detailed treatment see, e.g., <ref> [7] </ref>. In Physics, the system might describe the behaviour of gas molecules in a container. Here the types correspond to, say, velocity values, and the state p specifies how many molecules of each type there are at a certain point in time. <p> Here the types are species, p specifies the number of creatures of each type, and f describes the outcome of their interaction: for example, one species may be the food supply of the other, or compete with it for the same resource <ref> [7] </ref>. The basic object of study in any such system is the trajectory of a point p in the state space, i.e., the sequence of points p; f (p); f (f (p)); : : :. <p> Remarks: (a) Theorem 2 is a very special property that depends crucially on the symmetry of the operator fi . It is well known that asymmetric quadratic systems need not converge to a point but may exhibit more complex behaviour such as cycling <ref> [7] </ref>. (b) The above proof actually tells us rather more: it suffices to make the weaker assumption that some convergent subsequence has a limit with full support.

Reference-contexts: The importance of understanding the evolution of natural systems of this kind, and in particular the computational issue of the rate at which they approach limiting behaviour, is well known. Further motivation for the study of these questions is provided by a family of artificial systems called genetic algorithms <ref> [8] </ref>, which have recently gained acceptance as a general heuristic for solving combinatorial optimisation problems. The Appendix explains why similar questions about limit points and convergence rate arise when trying to understand these heuristics and estimate their efficiency. 1.3 Summary of results We consider only discrete-time, finite-dimensional systems.

Reference-contexts: The map f includes the Newtonian laws so as to produce from each state p a new state f (p) in the next time step, under some assumption about the spatial distribution of the molecules <ref> [11] </ref>. (One can also easily define a continuous-time analogue of this system). This view of dynamics is quite general and can in principle be used to describe a wide range of physical phenomena. <p> Remark: As mentioned in the Introduction, Theorem 1 is a discrete version of a classical result in statistical mechanics known as Boltzmann's H-Theorem, which asserts that the entropy of an ideal gas increases monotonically with time (see, e.g., <ref> [11] </ref>). Here the interaction probabilities fi ijkl have values that describe the collisions of pairs of gas molecules. The H-Theorem is generally proved for continuous time systems and assumed to hold for discrete time without rigorous justification.

Reference-contexts: More can be said about the general systems de scribed above. However, having established some key facts, we leave further development of the general setting to the full paper <ref> [12] </ref> and instead show how the above ideas may be applied to a specific example. 3 Matchings in graphs We define below a symmetric quadratic operator that acts on probability distributions over matchings in graphs. <p> This question turns out to be intimately related to the structure of the matching polytope of G; we defer a detailed discussion, which is of independent interest, to the full paper <ref> [12] </ref>. We turn now to the problem of determining the normal population to which the trajectory of a given initial population p (0) converges. Following the approach of the previous section, we identify a family of invariants of fi match .

Reference-contexts: Each of these classes behaves under B as an independent Markov chain, which is symmetric and aperiodic and thus has the uniform distribution as its unique stationary distribution. It is well known (see, e.g., <ref> [14, Section 5.6] </ref>) that such a Markov chain causes the entropy of any nonuniform probability distribution to increase strictly on every step.
