Abstract: We have developed a mathematical model for estimating the probability of routing on electrically programmable logic cell array (LCA). Using the model, the variation of the routability or the probability of routing with the average span of the nets, and flexibility of programming resources is determined. The results obtained from model have been verified experimentally. As expected, the routability also increases when the number of programming elements are increased. We also show a three dimensional relationship between routability, placement, and programming flexibility. Our results show a strong relationship between module placement and the routability for an LCA.

Reference-contexts: We have developed a mathematical model for LCA routing. In this paper we will use FPGA and LCA interchangeably. A stochastic model for routing field programmable gate arrays has also been developed in <ref> [1] </ref> that assumes a two-stage routing process of global routing followed by detailed routing. Recently it has been shown that the two stage routing may not be the best solution to FPGA configuration [7]. <p> The flexibility of an S block, F s , is defined as the number of segments to which a wire segment entering a S block can be connected. This LCA architecture is very similar to the one used in <ref> [1] </ref> and we have used their terminology for F c and F s . 3 Mathematical Model for Routing We develop a stochastic model for routing a given circuit on an LCA. The model finds the probability of successfully routing the nets in the presence of fixed routing resources. <p> Thus the channel densities for the LCA can be safely approximated by a Poisson distribution with the parameter g equal to R 2 , using the results of [4]. In <ref> [1] </ref>, the distribution of channel densities in actual circuits were shown to be quite close to the values from a Poisson distribution with the parameter R 2 . Both studies [4, 6] involve routability analysis based on a-priori knowledge of wire length distribution and a-priori knowledge of pins per cell. <p> For lower values of W like 5 or 6, these probabilities are considerable and ignoring them leads to a lower prediction of the routability. Similar to the model developed in <ref> [1] </ref>, our model also assumes that each of the F c switches for a logic block pin is equally likely to be on any of the W tracks.

Reference-contexts: Recently it has been shown that the two stage routing may not be the best solution to FPGA configuration [7]. Thus multi-terminal routing immediately after placement is being considered and has been found to outperform the two stage routing <ref> [3] </ref>. Our results also determine the probability of finding feasible paths from all possible routes. 2 Architecture of an LCA The architecture of the logic cell array is depicted in figure 1. The LCA is a two-dimensional array of logic blocks. It con sists of horizontal and vertical routing channels.

Reference-contexts: Thus, Routability = 1 T X P (RC i ) where P (RC i ) is the probability of the event RC i . The length of the connections is chosen from a probability distribution P L . In <ref> [4, 5, 6] </ref>, this distribution was found out to be geometric for a two-dimensional logic cell array architecture. Thus our model assumes the distribution P L to be geometric with a mean R. We consider all possible shortest connections between the end-points of a net. <p> Thus this model takes into account the side-effects of routing a net on the other nets. After that, we derive the probability of successfully routing a connection. 3.1 Predicting the Channel Densities El Gamal <ref> [4] </ref> and Sastry and Parker [6] developed stochastic models to estimate the routability in Master Slice Gate Arrays. The channel width estimates from these two models differ, however both studies are based on identical assumptions. <p> The results in <ref> [4] </ref> show that the channel width converges to a Poisson distribution with the parameter g given by g = 2 All the above assumptions are valid for the LCA architecture used in our model. <p> Thus the channel densities for the LCA can be safely approximated by a Poisson distribution with the parameter g equal to R 2 , using the results of <ref> [4] </ref>.
