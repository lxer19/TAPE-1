Title: An initial semantics for the -calculus on trees and Rabin's complementation lemma  
Author: Andre Arnold 
Address: Universite Bordeaux I  
Affiliation: LaBRI  
Abstract: In this paper we show that the function associated with any closed or non closed term of the -calculus on trees can be represented by a recognizable set of trees whose nodes are labeled by letters and by sets of variables. Rabin's complementation lemma is an immediate consequence of this result.

Reference-contexts: The Complementation property is obtained as a consequence of the determinacy of certain games. For Emerson and Jutla [2], O is the class of all closed terms of the -calculus on trees (cf. <ref> [9, 4, 7, 1] </ref>), for which the Complementation property is easy: every term t can be syntactically transformed into its dual ~t where L (~t ) is the complement of L (t ). <p> Beyond their interest in the present proof of Rabin's complementation lemma, we believe that f-sets should be a useful tool to define recognizable functions over sets of trees in the way suggested by Thomas in [12] or to investigate the problem posed in <ref> [1] </ref> of whether or not the alternation-depth hierarchy of the -calculus with intersection is finite. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we recall some notions and notations about trees. <p> A run is accepting if for any branch u (seen as an element of fl; rg ! ), the set of states occuring infinitely often in the infinite sequence (u [0])(u <ref> [1] </ref>) (u [n]) belongs to F . A tree t is accepted by A if there is an accepting run of A on t. The set of trees accepted by A is denoted by L (A).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There is no need to recall the importance, in logic and computer science, of Rabin's complementation lemma <ref> [10] </ref>: for any tree automaton A there is a tree automaton A 0 such that L (A 0 ), the set of infinite trees accepted by A 0 , is the complement of L (A), that constitutes the main lemma in the Rabin's proof of decidability of the monadic second-order theory <p> leads us to consider complete infinite trees whose nodes are labeled by a letter and a set of variables, called f-trees, because we use them as a concrete representation of functions over trees (such trees have been considered both by Muchnik [5], where variables are called "dead-ends", and by Rabin <ref> [10] </ref>). <p> We claim that all the difficulty of Rabin's theorem is concentrated in this result. 3 Of course, all methods used so far to prove Rabin's theorem can be used to prove this single result. Indeed it is not difficult to convince oneself that Lemmas 3.2 and 3.4 of Rabin <ref> [10] </ref> are direct proof of this result. <p> The set of trees accepted by A is denoted by L (A). A set T of trees is recognizable if there is an automaton A such that T = L (A), and we say that A recognizes T . 12 It is well known (cf. <ref> [10] </ref>), and easy to prove, that the family Rec (A) of recognizable subsets of T (A) is closed under union and intersection. Let us consider a second alphabet A 0 and a mapping : A ! A 0 .

Reference-contexts: In this case the Equivalence property is 8A; 9G : L (A) = L (G; I); and the Complementation property amounts to saying that for any game on any tree, one of the two players has a winning finite-state strategy (see also the survey of Thomas <ref> [11] </ref>). For Muller and Schupp [6], O is the class of alternating automata, which contains the usual automata, so that the Equivalence property is: for any alternating automaton B there is an automaton A such that L (B) = L (A).

Reference-contexts: Beyond their interest in the present proof of Rabin's complementation lemma, we believe that f-sets should be a useful tool to define recognizable functions over sets of trees in the way suggested by Thomas in <ref> [12] </ref> or to investigate the problem posed in [1] of whether or not the alternation-depth hierarchy of the -calculus with intersection is finite. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 1 we recall some notions and notations about trees.
