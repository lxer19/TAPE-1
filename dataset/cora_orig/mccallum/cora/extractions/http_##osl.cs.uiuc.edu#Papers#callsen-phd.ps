Reference-contexts: Extensions to ActorSpace 206 A possible solution is therefore to define an interface to actorspace pattern matching, and let the run-time system allow external pattern matching agents, analogous to the concept of "external pagers" for implementing user-space virtual memory management, which is supported by newer operating systems, such as Mach <ref> [ABG + 86, GJ91] </ref>. We will view a customized actorspace as an actor with the following definition of behavior: 13.2.
