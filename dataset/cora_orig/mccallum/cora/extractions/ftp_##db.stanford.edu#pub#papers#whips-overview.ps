Abstract: The goal of the data warehousing project at Stanford (the WHIPS project) is to develop algorithms and tools for the efficient collection and integration of information from heterogeneous and autonomous sources, including legacy sources. In this paper we give a brief overview of the WHIPS project, and we describe some of the research problems being addressed in the initial phase of the project.

Reference-contexts: reasons, the data warehousing approach may not be appropriate when absolutely current data is required, or when clients have unpredictable needs. 1 In reality, we believe that data warehousing should be seen as a complement, not a replacement, to passive query processing schemes, or to ad-hoc exploration and discovery mechanisms <ref> [2, 11] </ref>. For example, ad-hoc discovery mechanisms can identify information of interest, which can can be collected at the warehouse, improving and simplifying access to the information. The following examples suggest some of the application areas or characteristics for which the warehousing approach to information integration seems well suited. 1.

Reference-contexts: When a user query arrives, the query does not have to be translated and shipped to the original sources for execution (as would be done in, e.g., a mediated approach to information integration <ref> [19] </ref>.) Not only can such translation and shipping be a complex operation, but it also can be time consuming, especially if the sources are many and remote. <p> In this book, the advantages of the warehousing approach are put forth and a general architecture and suggested functionality are presented.

Reference-contexts: This decoupling between the base data on the one hand (at the sources), and the view definition and view maintenance machinery on the other (at the integrator), can lead the to incorrect views at the warehouse. We refer to this problem as the warehouse update anomaly problem <ref> [21] </ref>. There are a number of mechanisms for avoiding warehousing update anomalies. <p> The basic idea is to add to queries sent by the integrator to the sources compensating queries to offset the effect of concurrent updates. For details and examples of the Eager Compensating Algorithm, variations on the algorithm, and discussion of performance issues, refer to <ref> [21] </ref>. We plan to implement and experiment with the Eager Compensating Algorithm, along with the alternative approaches, within the rule-driven integrator framework described in Section 4.2. 5 Summary and Plans Data warehousing is a valuable alternative to traditional "passive" approaches for integrating and accessing data from autonomous, heterogeneous information sources.
