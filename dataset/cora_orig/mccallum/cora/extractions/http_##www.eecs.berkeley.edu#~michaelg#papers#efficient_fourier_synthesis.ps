Abstract: This paper discusses an additional signal processing procedure for use in a recently proposed frequency-domain additive synthesizer [1, 2]. The overlap-add approach used in the frequency-domain synthesis can result in amplitude modulation in the overlap region between successive time frames if the partial frequencies in those frames are significantly different. A new method is proposed in which sinusoids of linearly time-varying frequency (chirps) are used to accommodate the frame-to-frame frequency changes.

Reference-contexts: FREQUENCY-DOMAIN ADDITIVE SYNTHESIS In a recently proposed system, the additive synthesis is done in the frequency domain instead of the time domain so as to enhance the modification capabilities and improve the computational efficiency <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. The synthesis is based on partial parameters derived by a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) analysis followed by a spectral peak-picking algorithm.
