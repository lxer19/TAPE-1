Reference-contexts: The primary effort in prior automation is in the application of CSCW support for inspection collection meetings | that is, in the support for synchronous meetings (see for example <ref> [4, 1] </ref> ). But as we have shown above, asynchronous code inspections are more cost effective and at least as quality effective as synchronous inspections. Moreover, the cost of asynchronous automated support is significantly less than that of synchronous.

Reference-contexts: There is a significant difference for modified code, but the difference is effectively 0 (.0031 vs. .0037). Since this is and order of magnitude smaller than the densities for new code we conclude that meetingless inspections are no less effective than inspection with meetings. 1 Porter et al. <ref> [2] </ref> describes several approaches for measuring and estimating defect detection ratio.

Reference-contexts: We compare the results from these two classes of inspections: new code (Table 1 1) and repaired code (Table 2). The significance is calculated using the Wilcoxon-Mann and Whitney Rank Order Test <ref> [3] </ref> , a two-sided test assessing whether the fault densities observed for each inspection when taken from a desk or meeting are drawn from the same distribution. The smaller the value, the more significant.

Reference-contexts: From our viewpoint as experimentalists, the acceptance has come too readily and easily: we have lost our opportunity to control the important empirical variables and adequately assess the impact of the tool experimentally (see <ref> [6] </ref> for a description of our desired experimental structure). Because of its immediate acceptance at the grass roots level, the prototype has become a de facto product.

Reference-contexts: If on-line inspections are better than manual inspections, then it must be possible to eliminate meetings without decreasing effectiveness. Previous work <ref> [9, 8, 10] </ref> suggests that this is indeed the case, but until now there has been no direct evidence from an industrial environment.

Reference-contexts: Thus we are fortunate to have data available from one of these existing experiments that enables us to compare the effectiveness of synchronous vs. asynchronous inspections (see <ref> [12] </ref> for a similar example). The advantage of this approach is that the empirical infrastructure is already in place that is, the software development organization was already measuring the effects of two different inspection processes (desk-based collection versus meeting-based collection) and recording critical data for the two processes.
