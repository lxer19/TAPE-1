Reference-contexts: introduction of self-clocked fair queueing (SCFQ) <ref> [1] </ref>, [7]. The algorithm is based on the observation that the system's virtual time at any moment may be estimated from 12 the virtual finish time of the packet the currently being serviced.

Reference-contexts: As a matter of fact, the single rate is not a good choice since the source generates traffic at different rates at 15 different times <ref> [2] </ref>. Therefore, the scheduling scheme should satisfy the fair and firewall service even though the rate of the flows are highly fluctuated.

Reference-contexts: reference to other pictures, and arrangement of predictive (P) pictures, coded with reference to an immediate previous (I or P) picture, as well as an immediate future (P or I) picture, and bidirectionally-predicted picture (B) which provides the highest degree of compression, but require both past and future reference pictures <ref> [4] </ref>, [5], [14]. A GOP is defined by its length, N, the distance between I-frames, and M, the distance between P pictures. An example of a GOP with N=6 and M=6, consisting of one I picture, one P picture and four B pictures is shown in Fig. 20. <p> In addition, the P-frames tend to generate a greater number of bits than B-frames since only motion compensation is applied respect to the previous reference image <ref> [4] </ref>. 39 Fig. 20. Example of GOP in MPEG B. Traffic Smoothing The primary goal of the smoothing is to reduce the burstiness of video frames at the UNI (user network interface) so that the multiplexing gain can be increased [6]. Fig. 21. <p> Then the predicted results are used in smoothing modules. 1. Prediction Scheme Because of the bursty nature of MPEG video and coding mode, the correlation between consecutive frame is very low, but it is relatively high between frames encoded in the same mode <ref> [4] </ref>. For example, if GOP pattern is IBBPBB, we maintain six separate variables for each frame since the correlation of the frame that corresponds to previous same type frame, is highly related [4]. Fig. 22 and Fig. 23 shows the autocorrelation of lecture, advertisements and cnn MPEG. <p> between consecutive frame is very low, but it is relatively high between frames encoded in the same mode <ref> [4] </ref>. For example, if GOP pattern is IBBPBB, we maintain six separate variables for each frame since the correlation of the frame that corresponds to previous same type frame, is highly related [4]. Fig. 22 and Fig. 23 shows the autocorrelation of lecture, advertisements and cnn MPEG. The autocorrelation of cnn MPEG during the long lag is shown in Fig. 46 and Fig. 47 in Appendix A. The GOP sequence of lecture and advertisements, and cnn MPEG are IBBPBBPBB and IBBPBBPBBPBBPBB, respectively.

Reference-contexts: introduction of self-clocked fair queueing (SCFQ) [1], <ref> [7] </ref>. The algorithm is based on the observation that the system's virtual time at any moment may be estimated from 12 the virtual finish time of the packet the currently being serviced. <p> Thus, a flow that takes advantage of free bandwidth cannot be punished. While the calculation of virtual finish time is simpler in SCFQ, the inaccuracy makes SCFQ perform much worse than WFQ, since it incorrectly estimates its serviced rate. Fig. 7 <ref> [7] </ref> shows the unfair situation of SCFQ. There are 11 incoming flows in the switch or router. To simplify, one time unit is the speed of output link, and the packet size is fixed. We assume that the packets which have the same virtual finish time are served arbitrarily.
