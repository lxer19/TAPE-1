Abstract: With the growth in multimedia applications, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of these applications and derive the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. The multiple media streams and the synchronization across the media underline each application and its QoS requirements. These are normally negotiated upfront with the network service provider in the form of hard or soft guarantees. But the flow sequence of the streams, their interrelationships and the QoS may be affected by the changes made by the network service provider or the user interaction. This necessitates a systematic study of generic requirements of typical multimedia applications and specification of generic solutions in the form of protocol services in any network. This paper addresses these concerns by studying the network QoS requirements of multimedia presentation application. We use the idea of streams to characterize the multimedia application. An application sub-layer protocol called Multimedia Application Protocol (MMAP), which uses runtime support algorithms and provides services, for QoS negotiation and for handling user interaction, is proposed. We present an example from orchestrated multimedia application to show as to how the MMAP services can be used for implementing distributed multimedia applications.

Reference-contexts: If we visualize a simple three level architecture of a typical multimedia application, it will have three functional layers user, multimedia application and network service provider as shown in that, while the dynamics of user behavior may vary with the application context, the nature of interactions are fixed <ref> [9] </ref>. In the sequel, we use the terms input and interaction synonymously to refer to the actions such as skip, reverse, freeze, restart, etc. and refer to the sequence in which these inputs are given by the user as dynamics of the user behavior. <p> The identification of the different types of streams (primary, dependent secondary and independent secondary) and the identification of the next set of objects to presented are generic in nature. A set of algorithms have been proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>, outlining the operations to be carried out for skip, reverse presentation and navigate time. <p> These algorithms can use the formulae given in Section 2 for the preferred and acceptable throughput requirements. The algorithms can then be incorporated into the protocol for estimating the QoS requirements before its negotiation with the network service provider. A set of algorithms that are given in <ref> [9] </ref> can be used for this purpose. We propose an application sub-layer protocol called, Multimedia Application Protocol (MMAP), which will provide services for negotiating the QoS requirements with the network, for handling dynamic QoS modification by the network and for handling dynamic user behavior.
