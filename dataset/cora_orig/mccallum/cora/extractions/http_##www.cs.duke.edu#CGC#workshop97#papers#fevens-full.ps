Abstract: Summary: A convex quadrangulation with respect to a point set S is a planar subdivision whose vertices are the points of S, where the boundary of the unbounded outer face is the boundary of the convex hull of S, and every bounded interior face is convex and has four points from S on its boundary. A minimum weight convex quadrangulation with respect to S is a convex quadrangulation of S such that the sum of the Euclidean lengths of the edges of the subdivision is minimised. In this extended abstract, we will present a polynomial time algorithm to determine whether a set of points S admits a convex quadrangulation if S is constrained to lie on a fixed number of nested convex polygons, where the time complexity is polynomial in the cardinality of S. This algorithm can also be used to find a minimum weight convex quadrangulation of the point set. We use a similar approach to construct a convex subdivision with respect to S using three or four points from S per face, and minimising the total number of faces within the boundary of the convex hull of S.

Reference-contexts: To explore this area of research, we turn to the work of Anagnostou and Corneil on the Minimum Weight Triangulation problem on point sets lying on the boundaries of nested convex hulls <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> algorithm for a point set. 3 4 MWCQ of a Constrained Point Set The approach of Anagnostou and Corneil for the Minimum Weight Triangulation problem is centered on a dynamic programming algorithm based on finding optimal partitions of "legal polygons" of varying sizes (cardinality) defined from the point set, S <ref> [1] </ref>. At each stage of the algorithm, the optimal triangulation for a legal polygon is constructed from the best of all possible partitions of the polygon into legal subpolygons of smaller cardinality. Only one optimal solution is then kept for each legal polygon. <p> Most of the definitions are borrowed directly from Anagnostou and Corneil <ref> [1] </ref>. First, we introduce some definitions with regard to the nested convex hulls. <p> Proof. Proof by construction of all possible cases. See Anagnostou and Corneil <ref> [1] </ref> for an equivalent constructive proof for triangulations. 2 Definition 4.12 Given a legal polygon P (p; q), let u and v be the end points of legal paths p and q, respectively. Let w be a vertex 62 P (p; q) such that 4uwv is an empty triangle. <p> For h &gt; 1, this complexity is the same as for the Minimum Weight Triangulation algorithm of Anagnostou and Corneil <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> The time complexity is of the same order as the Minimum Weight Triangulation algorithm of Anagnostou and Corneil <ref> [1] </ref>. If a non-infinite weight is returned by Algorithm A, then it also returns the answer of affirmative whether a convex quadrangulation is admitted by the point set, as stated in the following theorem.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, relatively little published work has been done with regards to convex quadrangula-tions of planar point sets. There have been some heuristic algorithms for generating "well-shaped" quadrangulations, notably the work of Bose and Toussaint <ref> [2] </ref> using algorithms based on a serpentine triangulation of the point set. <p> Also, let S denote a given point set in the plane, including the vertices of P . If P admits a quadrangulation, then ffiP must have an even number of vertices. 7 Proof. Same type of argument as in the proof for Lemma 3.1 in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Definition 4.11 Define a convex partition with respect to a point set S to be a planar subdivision whose vertices are the points of S, where the boundary of the unbounded outer face is the boundary of the convex hull of S, and every bounded interior face is a

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction There are many problems for which it is necessary to find a numerical solution of a complicated system of differential equations. To find such a numerical solution, the finite element method <ref> [6] </ref> [20] is often employed. With this method, the domain over which the solution is sought is divided into small pieces (finite elements) determined by data points sampled from the domain. This subdivision, often generated automatically or semi-automatically, is termed a mesh.

Reference-contexts: Kahn, Klawe and Kleitman <ref> [8] </ref> then gave an existential proof that arbitrary simple orthogonal empty polygons can be partitioned into convex quadrangles. They also showed that any orthogonal polygon with n vertices and h holes can be decomposed into n=2 + h 1 convex quadrangles.

Reference-contexts: The related problem of decomposing a simple empty polygon P into the minimum number of convex polygons has been studied by Keil <ref> [9] </ref>, resulting in a O (N 2 n log n) algorithm where n is the number of vertices on ffiP and N is the number of reflex vertices (with interior angles greater then 180 degrees) on ffiP .

Reference-contexts: The quadrangulation of an empty polygon would be a special case where S " P only includes the vertices of P . 2 3 Previous Work The possible number of quadrangulations for a given empty polygon P can be exponential in the number of vertices on the boundary of P <ref> [10] </ref>, although an arbitrary simple empty polygon may not even necessarily admit a quadrangulation. <p> Also, Lubiw showed, using a fairly general computational model, that any algorithm used to decompose an orthogonal polygon with holes into convex quadrangles requires O (n log n) time. With regards to the minimum weight quadrangulation (minimum "ink" quadrangulation) of empty polygons, Keil and Sack <ref> [10] </ref> and Lubiw [13] showed that a minimum weight convex quadrangulation of a simple orthogonal polygon could be constructed in O (n 4 ) time and O (n 2 ) space using a straight forward dynamic programming algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Only one optimal solution is then kept for each legal polygon. Anagnostou and Corneil extended their method to the Minimum Weight Triangulation problem on a point set constrained to non-crossing straight lines. A more efficient solution to this latter problem was also presented by Meijer and Rappaport <ref> [14] </ref>. 4.1 Preliminaries Before we can discuss the partition of legal polygons and other aspects of the dynamic programming algorithm, we need a number of definitions. Most of the definitions are borrowed directly from Anagnostou and Corneil [1]. First, we introduce some definitions with regard to the nested convex hulls.

Reference-contexts: International Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures, WADS '95, Toussaint posed the problem of deciding whether one can "decide if a set of points admits a quadrangulation where every quadrangle is convex?", noting that this question was first raised by Joe Mitchell at the MSI Workshop in Stonybrook in 1993 <ref> [21] </ref>. In this abstract, we extend the work for finding MWCQs to planar point sets, and thus present a partial answer to the question posed by Toussaint.
