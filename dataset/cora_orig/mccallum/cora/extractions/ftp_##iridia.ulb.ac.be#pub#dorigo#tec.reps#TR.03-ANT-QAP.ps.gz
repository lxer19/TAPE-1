Title: THE ANT SYSTEM APPLIED TO THE QUADRATIC ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM  
Author: Vittorio Maniezzo Alberto Colorni Marco Dorigo 
Abstract: Technical Report 94/28 IRIDIA Universit Libre de Bruxelles Bruxelles, Belgium Abstract In recent years there has been growing interest in algorithms inspired by the observation of natural phenomena to define computational procedures which can solve complex problems. In this article we introduce a distributed heuristic algorithm which was inspired by the observation of the behavior of ant colonies and we propose its use for the Quadratic Assignment Problem. Finally the results obtained in solving some classical instances of the problem are compared with those obtained from other evolutionary heuristics to evaluate ^ Dipartimento di Scienze dell'Informazione, Universit di Bologna, Via Sacchi 3, 47023, Cesena, Italy, EU, maniezzo@csr.unibo.it & Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Via Ponzio 34/5, 20133, Milano, Italy, EU, colorni@elet.polimi.it # IRIDIA, Universit Libre de Bruxelles, Av.

Reference-contexts: In particular we are interested in the distribution of the search activity among agents which can only perform very simple actions, so that we can easily parallelize the computational effort. Our work was inspired by the research on the behavior of ant colonies <ref> (Denebourg, Pasteels and Verhaeghe, 1983) </ref>, where one of the problems of interest is to understand how ants, which are almost blind animals with very simple individual capacities, can, when they act together in a colony, find the shortest route between two points, (e.g. the ant's nest and a source of food). <p> The other possibility for improving the solutions constructed by the ants is a nondeterministic "hill-climbing" procedure (AS-SA), formed of a simulated annealing module <ref> (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi, 1983) </ref>. The simulated annealing implementation is the standard implementation for the annealing (temperature decrease) function, while there are some important variations for the initial temperature and the end-of-execution conditions. <p> The neighborhood of the current solution is examined comparing all the solutions obtained from the current solution by exchanging a pair of elements which form it. These second heuristics do not use the population concept and use different strategies to leave a local minimum: the Simulated Annealing (SA) method <ref> (Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi, 1983) </ref> accepts, with gradually decreasing probability, solutions worsening the objective function; the Tabu Search (TS) method (Glover, 1989; 1990; Skorin-Kapov, 1990; Taillard, 1990) accepts the best exchange and puts the last moves into a tabu list to prevent returning to previous solutions.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) of order n consists in looking for the best allocation of n activities in n locations, where the terms activity and location should be considered in their most general sense. It was first formulated in <ref> (Koopmans and Beckman, 1957) </ref> and since then has been recognized as a model of many different real situations; applications have been described concerning planning of buildings in university campuses, arrangement of departments in hospitals, minimization of the total wire length in electronic circuits, ordering of correlated data in magnetic tapes and

Reference-contexts: As an example we consider Nugent's problem of order 5 <ref> (Nugent, Vollman and Ruml, 1968) </ref>, a problem arising in a hospital layout location context. <p> As a complete analysis of the model which suggests the optimum values of the parameters in each situation has not yet been developed, we performed many simulations. The problems chosen are all described in the literature: some Nugent problems <ref> (Nugent, Vollman and Ruml, 1968) </ref> of dimension from 5 to 30, the Elshafei problem (Elshafei, 1977) of dimension 19, and a Krarup problem of dimension 30 (Krarup and Pruzan, 1978).
