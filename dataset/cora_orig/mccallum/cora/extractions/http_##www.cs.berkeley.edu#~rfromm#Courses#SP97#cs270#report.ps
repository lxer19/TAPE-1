Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Given an undirected graph G = (V; E), a k-coloring of G consists of assigning an integer in the range <ref> [1; k] </ref> to each vertex v 2 V . A valid k-coloring of G is a k-coloring for which no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same integer. Determining the smallest k for which there is a valid k-coloring of G is N P-hard.

Reference-contexts: This problem and variants of it are discussed in numerous books and articles. We list a sampling of the previous results in order to give some idea of the difficulty of the problem. A number of these results are discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. 1. Any bipartite graph can be 2-colored in polynomial time. 2. Any 3-colorable graph can be colored with ~ O (n 3=14 ) colors in polynomial time ([1]). 3. Any graph of maximum degree can be colored with + 1 colors in polynomial time using a greedy algorithm. <p> Instead of trying to build as large a maximal independent set as possible in each iteration, we instead focus on coloring the vertices which impose the most contraints. From <ref> [2] </ref>, we know that a graph of degree can be colored in + 1 colors using a greedy algorithm | which implies that high degree vertices are a natural place to begin looking for a maximal independent set. However, again, there may be several vertices with the same degree.
