(For example, if fl lies in the quadrant described by y &lt; b fl and x &gt; a fl , then we resolve fh i 2 H + : (b fl b i + c i )=a i a fl g; see <ref> [9] </ref> for details.) In cases 1 and 2, we have resolved a subset of H with weight at least W=2. Thus, we have achieved a fraction ffi (2) = 1=2 with fl (2) = 2 oracle calls.
