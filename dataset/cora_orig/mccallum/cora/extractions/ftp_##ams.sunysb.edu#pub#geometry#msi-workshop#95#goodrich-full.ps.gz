Abstract: We address the problem of drawing a 3-connected planar graph as a convex polyhedron in R 3 . We give an efficient algorithm for producing such a realization using O(n) volume under the vertex-resolution rule. Each vertex in the drawing resulting from this method is guaranteed to need no more than O(n log n) bits to represent (as a pair of rational numbers). This solves an open problem of Cohen, Eades, Lin, and Ruskey. We also show that under the angular-resolution rule drawing a 3-connected planar graph as a convex polyhedron in R 3 requires at least exponential volume in the worst case.

Reference-contexts: Our algorithm differs from theirs significantly in Step 1, however. Note that, under any of our resolution rules, if G has area A, then we can draw P to have volume A (by scaling the range of z-values to the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>). Let us therefore now concentrate on a method for drawing a 3-connected planar graph as a small-area planar convex equilibrium stress graph. 3 Algorithms for Small-Area Convex Equilibrium Stress Graphs Hopcroft and Kahn [28] show that there are convex planar embeddings that do not admit an equilibrium stress. <p> The proof of this lemma immediately implies an O (n 2 ) algorithm for computing such a stress, but we can actually implement this approach in linear time. Intuitively, the approach is to perform flow augmentations for many edges in G simultaneously by a "topological plane sweep" procedure <ref> [1, 2, 19] </ref>. <p> In addition, by well-known properties of rational-arithmetic linear system solving, we can guarantee that the number of bits needed to represent any y-coordinate, as a rational number, is O (n log n). If we scale the y-coordinates to lie in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then the drawing will still be a convex equilibrium stress embedding, but will have area O (n) under the vertex-resolution rule.

But recent advances in 3-dimensional visualization hardware have made 3-d drawings technically feasible, and a handful of researchers (and film makers 1 ) have begun to explore the possibilities of displaying graphs using this new technology [8, 17, 18].

In this section we review some important relationships of equilibrium stress graphs [28, 37, 38] and 3-dimensional convex drawings that will form a template for our convex drawing algorithm. 2.1 Convex equilibrium stress graphs Let G be a 3-connected planar graph embedded in R 2 . <p> Unfortunately, for our purposes, this approach does not in general produce nice drawings, for Eades and Garvan <ref> [17] </ref> show that such drawings can require exponential area under the vertex-resolution rule.

This template forms a very high-level description of our approach, as well as that of Eades and Garvan <ref> [17] </ref>. Our algorithm differs from theirs significantly in Step 1, however. Note that, under any of our resolution rules, if G has area A, then we can draw P to have volume A (by scaling the range of z-values to the interval [0; 1]). <p> The running time needed to achieve this is O (n + P (n)), where P (n) is the time needed to solve an n fi n linear system defined by planar constraints. Note that this area bound contrasts sharply with the exponential lower bound of Eades and Garvan <ref> [17] </ref> for the area of Tutte drawings under the vertex-resolution rule.

Reference-contexts: More recently, Eades and Garvan [17] address the problem of drawing 3-connected planar graphs as 3-dimensional convex polyhedra, adapting an approach of Hopcroft and Kahn <ref> [28] </ref> to produce such drawings in O (n 1:5 ) time in the real-RAM model. They do not analyze the bit complexity of their approach, but they do prove that their drawings have at least exponential volume under the vertex resolution rule. <p> above resolution rules for 3-dimensional graph drawing extends their resolution notions. 2 Convex Equilibrium Stress Graphs and 3-D Convex Drawings Our method builds upon the classic work of Tutte [37, 38] on the relationship between equilibrium stress graphs and planar convex drawings and the recent work of Hopcroft and Kahn <ref> [28] </ref> relating equilibrium stress graphs and 3-dimensional convex polytopes (see also [17]). <p> In this section we review some important relationships of equilibrium stress graphs <ref> [28, 37, 38] </ref> and 3-dimensional convex drawings that will form a template for our convex drawing algorithm. 2.1 Convex equilibrium stress graphs Let G be a 3-connected planar graph embedded in R 2 . Such an embedding is convex if every face of G is convex. <p> Thus, if we are to achieve polynomial area using this approach, we must use a more "adaptive" approach. As a step in this direction we note the following useful result of Hopcroft and Kahn: Lemma 2.2 <ref> [28] </ref>: Let G be an embedded planar graph with triangular external face, and let w be an internally-convex stress at internal equilibrium for G. Then there is an external extension w 0 of w that is convex and at equilibrium for G. <p> In this subsection we review the explicit formulation of Hopcroft and Kahn <ref> [28] </ref> for this mapping. Let G be a convex embedding of a 3-connected planar graph and let G have a convex equilibrium stress w. <p> Given such a mapping F , define a convex polyhedron by associating the plane z = 1 with the external face and the plane defined by f r with each internal face r in G. Hopcroft and Kahn <ref> [28] </ref> show the following: Theorem 2.3 [28]: If w is a convex equilibrium stress for a convex embedding G, then the polyhedron defined by a w-consistent mapping is strictly convex. Thus, we have a template for producing 3-dimensional strictly-convex drawings of 3-connected planar graphs: 1. <p> Given such a mapping F , define a convex polyhedron by associating the plane z = 1 with the external face and the plane defined by f r with each internal face r in G. Hopcroft and Kahn <ref> [28] </ref> show the following: Theorem 2.3 [28]: If w is a convex equilibrium stress for a convex embedding G, then the polyhedron defined by a w-consistent mapping is strictly convex. Thus, we have a template for producing 3-dimensional strictly-convex drawings of 3-connected planar graphs: 1. <p> Let us therefore now concentrate on a method for drawing a 3-connected planar graph as a small-area planar convex equilibrium stress graph. 3 Algorithms for Small-Area Convex Equilibrium Stress Graphs Hopcroft and Kahn <ref> [28] </ref> show that there are convex planar embeddings that do not admit an equilibrium stress. <p> Proof: The proof will be based upon an efficient implementation of the strategy of the previous proof using a monotone spanning tree technique <ref> [28] </ref>. Define a monotone spanning tree T on G by picking an outgoing (left-to-right oriented) edge for each node in G (other than the rightmost node). Remove the three external edges from G, leaving a spanning forest, T 0 , of trees rooted at nodes on the external face.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, it is a trivial exercise to derive from the published proofs of Steinitz's theorem an O (n 3 )-time method for drawing G as a 3-dimensional simplicial convex polytope in the real-RAM model <ref> [33] </ref>. Unfortunately, this approach seems to require at least exponential volume and an exponential number of bits to implement.

Reference-contexts: Incidentally, their method also yields a drawing of area O (n 2 ) under the edge-resolution rule. Moreover, Chrobak and Payne [7] show that the approach of de Fraysseix et al. can be implemented in O (n) time.

Since then, several researchers have worked on extending and tightening these results in the integer grid model [5, 6, 29].

Reference-contexts: That is, we wish to construct a set S of n points in R 3 so that G = conv (S), where conv (S) denotes the graph determined by the edges of the convex hull of S. It is well known (by Steinitz's theorem <ref> [36] </ref>) that such a drawing exists if and only if G is planar and 3-connected (see also Grunbaum [25]). Thus, let us assume for the remainder of this paper that our given graph G is planar and 3-connected, for these conditions can be tested in linear time [3, 4, 27]. <p> There are also a number of relevant previous results in 2-dimensional graph drawing.

If there exists an internally-convex stress function at internal equilibrium for G, then G is a convex embedding. Tutte shows how to use this theorem to draw G.
