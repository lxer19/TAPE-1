Abstract: Adequate protection of digital copies of multimedia content - both audio and video - is a prerequisite to the distribution of this content over networks. What is this IP protection problem and why is it hard to solve? In this paper we attempt to answer these questions in terms of various threat models. We then describe various technological approaches to solving the IP protection problem in the context of our threat models. We approach this by first describing solutions from a systems perspective. We then focus on the components of such systems. Particular attention is paid to a steganographic mechanism most commonly known as digital watermarking or fingerprinting and to its role in IP protection systems. Watermarking has gained rather abundant attention of late and is seen by some as a panacea. We analyze how watermarking may be used and then focus on specific mechanisms for audio and video.

Reference-contexts: However, improvements in network and storage technologies will soon lower these barriers. Perhaps the most fundamental advance is in compression technology. For audio, perceptual algorithms such as the new MPEG-2 Advanced Audio Coder <ref> [AAC] </ref> give near CD quality for most music and most listeners at a compression rate of 11 to 1 (128 kilobits per second). We can store more music in less space, storage is becoming cheaper and networks will allow greater throughput. All music currently distributed on CDs is unprotected. <p> We feel that cleartext watermarks should not be used to gate access to content. Bitstream (semantic-non-altering) Watermarking: Bitstream marking algorithms manipulate the compressed digital bitstream without changing the semantics of the audio or video stream. For example, a data envelope in an MPEG-2 Advanced Audio Coding (AAC <ref> [AAC] </ref>) audio frame could contain a watermark, albeit one which could easily be removed, e.g. by the parser mentioned above. Bitstream marking is low-complexity so can be used to carry transaction information.

Reference-contexts: Building such a mechanism in software is all but impossible. Recent work in tamper resistant software <ref> [AUC] </ref> is promising; it helps protect against casual attackers and keeps the honest user honest. This technology may be used to implement renewable security machinery; each instantiation of the client application can be made unique so that attackers must do the same amount of work for every client.

Reference-contexts: For each of these, a restriction on the ways that the content encryption key may be used is imposed. To manage these licensing issues a flexible mechanism is needed. PolicyMaker <ref> [BFL] </ref> is such a mechanism. PolicyMaker is a trust management engine that seeks to answer questions about trustworthiness of principals seeking access to resources in the presence of credentials and policies concerning those resources.

Reference-contexts: System designers should think carefully before using watermarks to gate usage, since by feeding different bitstreams into the decompressor the attacker may be able to probe the watermark algorithm, discover mark sites and possibly generate fraudulent marks <ref> [CL] </ref>. If a marking algorithm is to be used to gate usage, the algorithm should be designed in such a way that tampering with the mark should degrade the quality of the decompressed content. This suggests that the marking algorithm could beneficially be associated with the compression algorithm. <p> Note that if synchronization codes are used , the watermark can be recovered in the compressed domain through a lightweight recovery process. It can therefore be used for gating access to content. Although the attacker can use the gating mechanism to probe for the watermark sites <ref> [CL] </ref> and perhaps damage the synchronization codes, damage to the codes will generally produce perceptible artifacts. 5.6 Audio Results To evaluate our audio watermarking algorithm we used AT&Ts implementation of AAC.

Reference-contexts: In the most basic system, content is distributed in a cryptographic envelope. A random content encryption key is generated and used to encrypt the bits using some symmetric scheme such as DES <ref> [DES] </ref>. The key is then sold or licensed to clients and distributed (for example) by encrypting it with the clients public key. The client then uses its private key to uncover the content key and decrypt and decompress the content.

Reference-contexts: Depending on the details of the marking algorithm, the mark may survive D/A conversion. An example of this approach is <ref> [HG] </ref>, which does not use perceptual techniques. We now present another example. 13 5.5 Integrating the Watermarking Algorithm with Compression We have developed a first generation system that combines bitstream and integrated watermarking. It can be configured to support the three marking functions mentioned above. <p> Further, the increase in bit rate associated with marking should be small, and so must be monitored. A feedback mechanism similar to the one in <ref> [HG] </ref> can be used to prevent modification of scale factors that would increase the bit rate significantly. Watermark bits can be inserted in a variety of ways. Generally watermark sequences are inserted a few bits per frame.

Reference-contexts: Exactly what information should be bound is application specific but might include title, ownership, rights, international identifiers, etc. Digital watermarking has been discussed as such a mechanism. (See for example <ref> [IH96] </ref>.) However, watermarking has been proposed not only as a mechanism for identifying content but for gating the use of content as well. <p> A watermark should survive tandem encoding-decoding. Many algorithms reported in the literature claim to be robust in this sense for some limited number of generations <ref> [IH96] </ref>. 7) Tamper resistant or tamper evident. Most algorithms are robust, to some degree, against certain kinds of attacks, but none is tolerant of all attacks.

Reference-contexts: But one can still stream a film or any other content if one has been able to gain access to it in an unprotected state. The film can then be stored on writeable DVDs.

Reference-contexts: We have outlined a few basic attacks on watermarks in this section. Although many other attacks can be and have been mounted <ref> [PAK] </ref>, these attacks represent a minimum level of robustness an algorithm should display for a particular application before the algorithm can be considered to have increased the security of the system. 5.3 Desirable characteristics of watermark algorithms The following requirements are typically demanded of watermarks. 1) Watermark imperceptibility. <p> Many cleartext marking algorithms have been reported, see e.g. [ICIP97]. Many (if not all) cleartext watermarking mechanisms have been successfully attacked or are susceptible to classes of attacks reported in <ref> [PAK] </ref>. These algorithms are likely to be susceptible to frame-based collusion attacks. It is also the case that many commercial marking systems depend largely on algorithm obscurity for security. This is contrary to good system design, as the history of cryptography has shown.

Reference-contexts: Cleartext marking relies on perceptual methods to embed a data stream in a signal imperceptibly. The model for many cleartext marking algorithms is one in which a signal is injected into a noisy communication channel, where the audio/video signal is the interfering noise <ref> [SC] </ref>. Because the channel is so noisy, and the mark signal must 12 be imperceptible, the maximum bit rates that are achieved for audio are generally less than 100bps.
