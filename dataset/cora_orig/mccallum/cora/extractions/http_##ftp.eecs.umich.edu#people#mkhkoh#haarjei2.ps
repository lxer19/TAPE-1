Abstract: The sheet metal drawing operation is a complex manufacturing process involving more than forty process variables. The intricate interaction among these variables affect the forming tonnage which is measured by strain gages mounted on the press. A fault is said to occur when any of these process variables deviate beyond their specified limits. Current detection schemes based on thresholding do not fully exploit the information in the tonnage signals for the detection and isolation of multiple fault condition. It is thus an excellent case study for demonstrating the implementation of the detection methodology presented in Part 1. By partitioning the tonnage signature into disjoint segments, mutually exclusive sets of

Reference-contexts: Both the forces generated by the outer blankholding binders and the inner punch have significant impact on the quality of the part produced. These forces are also highly sensitive to changes in a number of process variables <ref> [1] </ref>, [4]- [5], [9] which may be broadly classified under: material properties, die set variables, press variables and interactive variables. Tonnage signatures are altered either directly by changes in these process variables or indirectly by occasions of splits, wrinkles or slugs in the drawing stage.

Reference-contexts: Establish detection threshold The UMP threshold for each Haar coefficient is computed from (30) using data collected during normal operation of the press. The mean and standard deviation of a Haar coefficient c i can be determined from (16) and (17). The value of is read off a table <ref> [6] </ref> when a level of significance, ff, has been predetermined. Step 4. Monitor the sets C j ; j = 1; 2; : : : ; J Apply the UMP to detect jumps in the selected Haar coefficients, that is, all c i 2 fC j g j=1 . <p> This trend is typical of the "curse of dimensionality" which describes the phenomena of deteriorating performance with increasing number of features used. The ROC curves for segments S 1 and S 2 are shown in Fig. 9. The value of ff is derived from <ref> [6] </ref> for 2:0 4:0.

Reference-contexts: Fault diagnosis is seldom quantitative and depends on the 2 experience of the technician who "eyeballs" errant signatures for some indications of the fault. Some attempts have been made to develop some kind of diagnostic tool for the forming process based on tonnage signatures. Martinez-Heath and Bortfeld <ref> [7] </ref> used the number of threshold crossings of the control limits of the template signature to discriminate between good and bad processes. Seem and Knussman [8] used the statistical measurements of peak tonnage to detect worn dies.

Both of these methods however are only effective for faults with significant amplitude changes. Faults which alter only the frequency content of the tonnage signal (for example, gib chatter) would escape detection by the amplitude-based control limits.
