Abstract: This note describes the Direct Deposit Protocol (DDP), a simple protocol for multicomputing on a carpet cluster. This protocol is an example of a user-level protocol to be layered on top of the low-level, sender-based protocols for the Protocol Processing Engine. The protocol will be described in terms of its system call interface and an operational decription.
