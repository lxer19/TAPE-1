Abstract: The problem we address is how to quickly estimate by simulation the loss in a buffer with multiclass on-off Markov fluid sources. We generate the Markov fluids with the altered rate matrices given in [11], instead of the originals, to speed up the simulation. Likelihood ratios are used to recover an estimate of the loss for the original traffic parameters.

Reference-contexts: We assume that the sources of the buffer are independent Markov fluids <ref> [1] </ref>. That is, the time-derivative of each source is a function of a continuous-time Markov chain on a finite state space. If the arrival process to a buffer with deterministic service rate is a superposition of independent Markov fluids, then the buffer occupancy has piecewise-linear trajectories with random slope.

Reference-contexts: Quick Simulation Approach To speed up the simulation to estimate , we alter or "tilt" the parameters of the arrival process so that the deviant behavior we are interested in (buffer overflow) becomes typical 1 Supported by: NSERC of Canada, Pacific Bell, Micro Grant of the State of California (see <ref> [4] </ref>, [2],[13]). We assume that the sources of the buffer are independent Markov fluids [1]. That is, the time-derivative of each source is a function of a continuous-time Markov chain on a finite state space.

Reference-contexts: We assume fl i 1 &lt; fl i 2 &lt; 1 for all i. Let i be the invariant of Q i ( i Q i = 0) and N i be the number of sources of type i. In [12] and <ref> [5] </ref>, we heuristically argued that has the following form = exp (BI (N; c) + o (B)) (1) where N = (N 1 ; :::; N K ), I (N; c) = inf P P K P K ; and exp (T H i (m i )) is approximately the probability <p> By evaluating I (N; c) we can approximate by exp (BI (N; c)); but this approxi mation may not be accurate when the "o (B)" terms are significant (see the simulations reported in <ref> [5] </ref>). Therefore, we base our change of parameters on an analysis of I (N; c). A (quick) simulation is conducted to take the possible significance of the "o (B)" terms into account. <p> The optimality of this choice of tilted parameters for the discrete-time buffer was proved recently in [3]. A quick simulation approach which assumes equation (1) holds but does not rely on knowledge of the traffic parameters is described in <ref> [5] </ref>. In summary, for a buffer with deterministic service rate and multiclass independent Markov fluid sources, we have derived an expression for tilted rate matrices in order to estimate the probability of buffer overflow in a busy cycle quickly.

If ff i () is defined to be the effective bandwidth of a call of type i, then ff i depends only on the type i parameters (i.e., Q i and fl i ) and [12]: I (N; c) ffi &gt; 0 , i=1 Thus, for large B, the constraint <p> for ^ M is obtained by using the concept of effective bandwidths ([8], [7], <ref> [12] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Using a form of important sampling deduced from large deviations, the traffic parameters are altered (or "tilted") so that is much larger and can be more accurately estimated in a reasonable amount of simulation time ("quick simulation" [16],[4], [2],[13], <ref> [15] </ref>). Likelihood ratios are used to recover an estimate for the original traffic parameters. This note is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the conjectured optimal choice for the tilted parameters reported in [11] and our quick simulation approach. A multiclass simulation example is reported in section 3.
