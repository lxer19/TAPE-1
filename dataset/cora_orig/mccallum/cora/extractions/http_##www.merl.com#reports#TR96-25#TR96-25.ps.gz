Reference-contexts: Double clicking on the icon label brings up the dialog box again, allowing further editing. 4 Implementation Details DeckView is implemented in C++ and Motif. The GNU Ghostscript interpreter is used to render document images. Documents must be formatted according to the Adobe Document Structuring Conventions (DSC) <ref> [1] </ref> to enable the navigation and annotation features, though non-DSC PostScript documents are supported with limited functionality.

Reference-contexts: The left tray holds permanent bookmarks, the right temporary ones. These bookmark thumbnails remain horizontally 1 There are other ways in which on-line document viewing might be enhanced: the "Virtual Paper" project at DEC SRC <ref> [2] </ref> is motivated by the same general goals as ours, but its developers have concentrated on different aspects of the document-viewing task. 2 Note that this aspect of the interaction permits an arbitrary number of pages, regardless of the height of the tray.

Reference-contexts: On-line document annotation can be an important element of computer-supported collaborative work <ref> [3] </ref>. Again, our strategy has been to use a single device for all types of annotation and linking. Annotations are added to a document by dragging the annotation button (to the left of the "Previous Page" button) to a specific location on the page in the page-display window.
