Title: Supporting Fine-Grained Data Lineage in a Database Visualization Environment

Abstract: The lineage of a datum records its processing history. Because such information can be used to trace the source of anomalies and errors in processed data sets, it is valuable to users for a variety of applications including investigation of anomalies and debugging. Traditional data lineage approaches rely on metadata. However, metadata does not scale well to fine-grained lineage, especially in large data sets. For example, it is not feasible to store all of the information necessary to trace from a specific floating point value in a processed data set to a particular satellite image pixel in a source data set. In this paper, we propose a novel method to support fine-grained data lineage. Rather than relying on metadata, our approach lazily computes lineage using a limited amount of information about the processing operators and the base data. We introduce the notions of weak inversion and verification. While our system does not perfectly invert the data, it uses weak inversion and verification to provide a number of guarantees about the lineage it generates. We propose a design for the implementation of weak inversion and verification in an object-relational database management system.

Reference-contexts: However, some scientific applications require lineage at a much finer granularity than previously considered we know of applications that require lineage at the level of pixels in images <ref> [2] </ref>. Imagine a scientist who is debugging an application that uses a regridded (interpolated) composite of many raster images. This user might need to know which pixels of which original raster images were used in the construction of the composite.

Reference-contexts: Recent scientific workflow systems (e.g., GIS databases such as Ge-olineus [6] and geophysical databases such as BigSur <ref> [3] </ref>) automate the process of lineage tracking by providing direct support in the workflow infrastructure. BigSur, for example, can supply the entire graph of processing steps by which a given satellite image was produced, or a list of all images produced using a given processing step.

Reference-contexts: Concrete model This section applies the concepts of the abstract model to our environment. Weak inversion and verification are being implemented in the Tioga database visualizer [11][1]. Tioga adopts the boxes-and-arrows programming paradigm popularized by AVS [14], Data Explorer <ref> [7] </ref>, and Khoros [10]. Every box is a user-defined function and arrows represent the flow of data between these functions. Certain boxes are database browsers which visualize data and display it to the user.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 describes the inversion planner. Finally, Section 5 presents conclusions and future work. Example scenario As a real-world application of our techniques, we consider a scenario for extracting cyclone tracks from atmospheric simulation data, based on <ref> [8] </ref>. In this subsection, we present the processing steps used in this scenario. Throughout the paper, to illustrate portions of the model, we discuss the weak inversion and verification of functions in this example. Validation of atmospheric simulations involves the com-parison of model data to observational data.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we discuss how properties of weak and verified inverses can be preserved during the combination of weak inversion and verification functions. We then present the algorithm the inversion planner follows to invert a chain. We make several simplifying assumptions. In <ref> [15] </ref> we consider further optimizations which may be made if these assumptions are relaxed. * We assume all tables (including intermediate results) are materialized. * We assume there is a per-tuple cost of applying an f w k (as opposed to a fixed or per-byte cost). * We assume that the <p> Details appear in <ref> [15] </ref>. Next, we discuss the case in which f k s are aggregate. Suppose T out contains two attributes x and y. In this situation, there is no guarantee that a single tuple in T in must be relevant to I. <p> Each of these cases has different performance implications, as discussed in <ref> [15] </ref>. <p> We have discussed how it can help users track the lineage of specific data. We are currently exploring several ways in which weak inversion and verification can be applied to optimization problems such as view maintenance, efficient materialization of partial results, and enhanced semantic query optimization <ref> [15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For example, Earth scientists can easily afford to store, say, 100 bytes of metadata for the 100 6000x6000 raster images they receive in a day. Even outside of the database field, (e.g., in such areas as dataflow program debugging <ref> [16] </ref>), researchers have assumed that the space/time cost of data tagging will be acceptable. However, some scientific applications require lineage at a much finer granularity than previously considered we know of applications that require lineage at the level of pixels in images [2].
