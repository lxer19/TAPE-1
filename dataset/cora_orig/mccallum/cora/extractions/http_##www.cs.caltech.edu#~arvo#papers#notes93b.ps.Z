Title: Linear Operators and Integral Equations in Global Illumination  
Author: James Arvo 
Affiliation: Program of Computer Graphics Cornell University  
Abstract: These notes introduce the basic concepts of integral equations and their application in global illumination. Much of the discussion is expressed in the language of linear operators to simplify the notation and to emphasize the algebraic properties of the integral equations. We start by reviewing some facts about linear operators and examining some of the operators that occur in global illumination. Six general methods of solving operator and integral equations are then discussed: the Neumann series, successive approximations, the Nystrom method, collocation, least squares, and the Galerkin method. Finally, we look at some of the steps involved in applying these techniques in the context of global illumination.

Reference-contexts: It is appropriate to refer to the elements of a function space either as "functions" or as "vectors", depending on the which level of structure one is considering. To illustrate, we first consider a simple function space; the collection of all real-valued functions on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, which we denote by X. The elements of X form a natural vector space if we define addition and scalar multiplication of functions pointwise. <p> That is, if f and g are two functions in X, we define the sum f + g and the scalar multiple fff to be new functions in the obvious way: (f + g)(x) f (x) + g (x) for each x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. It is easy to verify that X satisfies all the properties of a vector space with these operations. Precisely the same constructions apply to functions of several variables, such as radiance functions. <p> The dimension of a vector space is the maximal number of linearly independent elements. It is easy to see that the space X above is infinite dimensional, since the Fourier basis functions sin (nx), for n = 1; 2; : : :, are all linearly independent on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. In most problems involving function approximation the desired function is a member of some infinite-dimensional space. To be representable on a computer, however, the approximation must live in a space of only finite dimension. <p> We define the set L p (<ref> [0; 1] </ref>) to be the set of functions defined on the interval [0; 1] for which the integral makes sense and is finite. Since linear combinations of elements in L p retain these properties, it is a normed linear space with the norm jjjj p . We shall make use of the spaces L 1 and L 2 . <p> Furthermore, if the domain of T is a function space, we call it a linear operator. The most important linear operator for us will Linear Operators and Integral Equations 2-5 be the integral operator. Let k : <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 ! R be a continuous function on the unit square and consider the operator K defined by K 0 where the brackets are meant to accomodate a function of y. <p> linear operator over an appropriate domain X, such as L 1 (<ref> [0; 1] </ref>). Indeed, for any f; g 2 L 1 ([0; 1]), we have [K (f + g)](x) = 0 = 0 = 0 Z 1 k (x; y) g (y) dy Since this holds for all x 2 [0; 1], by definition the functions themselves are equal: K (f + g) = Kf + Kg: (9) Similarly, it can be shown that K (fff ) = ffKf . Therefore, K satisfies equation (6), showing that K is a linear operator on L 1 ([0; 1]). <p> Therefore we need to rely upon numerical methods. A large assortment of numerical techniques exist for solving integral equations <ref> [1] </ref>, and we shall only touch on a few of them. To illustrate the principles, assume K : X ! X is a bounded linear operator, where X is a space of functions defined over a domain D.

Reference-contexts: A major advantage of the Nystom method is that it can easily accomodate differential operators by means of finite difference approximations. This makes it readily applicable to problems involving participating media. The finite basis approaches have been the most prevelant in global illumination; particularly collocation <ref> [14] </ref>.

The advantage of finite elements in global illumination is that the element boundaries can be used to more accurately model discontinuities of various orders in the radiance functions.

Reference-contexts: For instance, if k and g are step functions, then the solution f to equation (29) must also be a step function <ref> [36] </ref>, yet we can say nothing about the form of f in equation (27). This fact would seem to indicate that 2nd kind equations are in some sense nicer to work with than 1st kind equations. This is indeed the case. <p> In general, we can obtain the kernel corresponding to the operator K n by a recurrence relation: k n (x; z) = k (x; y) k n1 (y; z) dy: (43) The kernel k n is called the iterated kernel of order n <ref> [36] </ref>. From the Neumann series we see that the kernel of the operator M n can be obtained by summing the iterated kernels of all orders up to n: m n (x; z) i=0 where k 0 is taken to be the identity.

Reference-contexts: Up until 1926 much of the analysis of interreflection was still carried out in a more tedious manner <ref> [37] </ref>, even though a significant theory of integral equations was already in existence [2, 3].

Reference-contexts: The successive kernels, or terms of the expansion, correspond to rays that have undergone increasing numbers of reflections. This very natural physical interpretation is often referred to as successive orders of scattering in radiative transfer literature <ref> [24, 38] </ref>. The method of discrete ordinates used in radiative heat ransfer [11, 23], atmospheric scattering [24], and neutron transport [7] works by applying quadrature rules to discretely sampled positions and directions. Thus, it is essentially an application of the Nystrom Linear Operators and Integral Equations 2-17 method.

Reference-contexts: Zatz took this approach, choosing polynomial basis functions defined over individual patches <ref> [39] </ref>. The resulting expressions for hKu i j u j i require quadruple integrals, yet their support is limited to the pair of patches involved, making the computation of the inner products feasible.
