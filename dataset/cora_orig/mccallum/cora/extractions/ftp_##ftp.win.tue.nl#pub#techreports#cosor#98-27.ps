Abstract: We consider a storage model that can be either interpreted as a certain queueing model with dependence between a service request and the subsequent interarrival time, or as a fluid production/inventory model with a two-state random environment. We establish a direct link between the workload distributions of the queueing model and the production/inventory model, and we present a detailed analysis of the workload and waiting time process of the queueing system.

Reference-contexts: According to the original production/inventory interpretation, our model is motivated as a replacement model with preventive maintenance. For a detailed survey on replacement policies and preventive maintenance we refer to Beichelt <ref> [1] </ref> and Voldes-Flores and Feldman [16]. According to the queueing interpretation, our model is a correlated single server queue with Markov arrivals.

Reference-contexts: According to the queueing interpretation, our model is a correlated single server queue with Markov arrivals. There are quite a few studies on single server queues in which the service time of a customer depends on the previous interarrival time; see, e.g., Borst et al. <ref> [2] </ref> that also contains an extensive list of references. But in the present case, as in [13] mentioned above, it is the interarrival time that depends on the service request of the previous arrival.

Reference-contexts: However, the resulting Wiener-Hopf decomposition in general does not yield a very explicit solution whereas in the present case such an explicit solution is indeed obtained. See Cidon et al. <ref> [5] </ref> for a detailed analysis of a =M=1 queue in which the interarrival time depends linearly on the service time of the previous customer. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the queueing model in detail.

Reference-contexts: But in the present case, as in [13] mentioned above, it is the interarrival time that depends on the service request of the previous arrival. In principle, this kind of dependence is allowed in the Lindley approach to the waiting time process in the G=G=1 queue (see Cohen <ref> [6] </ref>, Section II.6.3). However, the resulting Wiener-Hopf decomposition in general does not yield a very explicit solution whereas in the present case such an explicit solution is indeed obtained. <p> that E [min (B; T )] is less than the mean interarrival time EA, where A denotes a generic interarrival time: O 0 (0) 0 (0) &lt; 0 1 (0): (2.3) For the waiting time, this follows immediately from Lindley's theorem for the ordinary single server queue ([10], cf. also <ref> [6] </ref>, Section II.1.3), as this theorem applies even if an interarrival time depends on the previous service time. <p> We assume that the ergodicity condition (2.3) is satisfied. Consider the steady-state distribution F i (x) := lim t!1 PfV (t) &lt; x; J (t) = ig; x 0; i = 0; 1: (3.1) Using level crossing theory [7], or using the integro-differential method of Takacs [14] (cf. also <ref> [6] </ref>, Section II.4.5), we obtain for x &gt; 0: dF 0 (x) = 0 F 0 (x) 0 y=0 b=0 1 y=0 b=0 dF 1 (x) = 1 F 1 (x) 0 y=0 z=0 1 y=0 z=0 Let Z 1 e sx dF i (x); Re s 0; i = 0; <p> In the present section we determine the steady-state waiting time distribution, by using a Wiener-Hopf approach. This is a classical approach for the G=G=1 queue, cf. Lindley [10]; see also Section II.6.3 of <ref> [6] </ref>. A nice feature of the model under consideration is, that the Wiener-Hopf decomposition can be worked out in detail here, leading to quite explicit results. <p> It should be possible to extend the analysis of Sections 3 and 4 to the case of interarrival intervals with distributions that have a rational LST; cf. the analysis of the K m =G=1 queue in Section II.5.11 of <ref> [6] </ref>. For example, in (4.3) the terms i =( i s) then have 12 to be replaced by more complicated quotients of polynomials, after which all the zeros of the resulting new function h (s) in Re s &gt; 0 must be determined.

Reference-contexts: Note that the above stochastic process is a Markov process. We assume that the ergodicity condition (2.3) is satisfied.

Reference-contexts: Perry and Posner [13] have studied the special case in which the threshold T is a constant and the OFF periods of both types are exponentially distributed. Their analysis is based on the fact (cf. Kella and Whitt <ref> [9] </ref>) that the conditional steady-state buffer content distribution, given that it is positive, is independent of the inflow rate ff. Obviously, the validity of this fact holds for the more general case to be considered in the present paper in which the threshold T is a generally distributed random variable. <p> In this paper we concentrate on the queueing interpretation. We present a detailed analysis of the joint distribution of workload and `state of the arrival process', as well as of the waiting time distribution. We refer to Kella and Whitt <ref> [9] </ref> for a discussion of the equivalence relation between the workload process of the GI=G=1 queue and the buffer content process of a fluid model with linear flow and a two-state random environment.

Reference-contexts: It is assumed that negative inventory is not allowed, so there is no outflow whenever the buffer is empty.

Their analysis is based on the fact (cf. <p> There are quite a few studies on single server queues in which the service time of a customer depends on the previous interarrival time; see, e.g., Borst et al.

In the production/inventory application that motivated their study, the threshold is not necessarily deterministic.
