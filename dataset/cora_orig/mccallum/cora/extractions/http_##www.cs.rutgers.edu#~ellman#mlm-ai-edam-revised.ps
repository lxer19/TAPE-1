Abstract: Physical systems can be modeled at many levels of approximation. The right model depends on the problem to be solved. In many cases, a combination of models will be more effective than a single model alone. Our research investigates this idea in the context of engineering design optimization. We present a family of strategies that use multiple models for unconstrained optimization of engineering designs. The strategies are useful when multiple approximations of an objective function can be implemented by compositional modeling techniques. We show how a compositional modeling library can be used to construct a variety of locally calibratable approximation schemes that can be incorporated into the optimization strategies. We analyze the optimization strategies and approximation schemes to formulate and prove sufficient conditions for correctness and convergence. We also report experimental tests of our methods in the domain of sailing yacht design. Our results demonstrate dramatic reductions in the CPU time required for optimization, on the problems we tested, with no significant loss in design quality. fl Artificial Intelligence for Engineering Design, Analysis, and Manufacturing, 11, 5, 1997.

Reference-contexts: In this context, methods of dependency tracing suffice for deciding on which model to use to answer a given query. More sophisticated methods reason about the sign of the error of approximate models <ref> [ Addanki et al., 1991 ] </ref> , [ Weld, 1990 ] . In contrast to our work, considerations of numerical accuracy are not used at all to guide the choice of a suitable model.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, our technique uses multiple domain-specific models in the fitting process, rather than a single domain-specific model in combination with a domain-independent fitting technique. Our recalibrating strategies are similar in spirit to numerical continuation methods for solving equations or optimizing functions <ref> [ Allgower and Georg, 1990 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: These two modules are especially good candidates for approximation because they both involve time-consuming computational fluid-dynamics (CFD) codes. For example, effective draft D can be computed using a potential-flow code called "PMARC" [ Katz and Plotkin, 1991 ] , <ref> [ Ashby et al., 1992 ] </ref> . It can also be approximated by a simple algebraic formula. Likewise, wave resistance Rw can be computed using a slender-body flow code called "SLAW" [ Weems et al., 1994 ] .

Reference-contexts: In contrast to our work, however, these efforts have adhered to a paradigm in which there is a single model of the objective function, which remains fixed during the optimization process. A method of adapting standard optimization techniques to deal with modeling error is reported in <ref> [ Cagan and Williams, 1993 ] </ref> . In this work, the authors develop a modification of the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions for local optimality. In particular, they present a method of modifying the objective function (for unconstrained optimization) and the Lagrangian (for constrained optimization).

Reference-contexts: The performance of M LM 1 will depend in part on the order of convergence <ref> [ Dahlquist and Bjorck, 1974 ] </ref> of the optimization method. Consider what happens when the method has linear convergence. <p> Little can be said in general about these tradeoffs. On the other hand, the asymptotic behavior of M LM 2 can be characterized more precisely. In particular, the order of convergence <ref> [ Dahlquist and Bjorck, 1974 ] </ref> of M LM 2 is equal to the smallest derivative of I (s) with a nonzero norm at the optimum. (Assuming suitably many derivatives of I (s) are defined and continuous.) Thus if j@I (s)=@ sj &gt; 0 at the optimum, then M LM 2

Reference-contexts: A possible modification to strategy M LM 2 is suggested by analogy with "trust region" optimization techniques <ref> [ Dennis and Schnabel, 1983 ] </ref> . A trust region method fits an approximation ^e s (x) to the objective function e (x) at the design point s = s old . <p> Although the composition of the InnerOptimization and LineSearch is guaranteed to converge to a limit, the result may not be a correct solution to the original optimization problem. We can overcome this limitation by using a more sophisticated line search algorithm, e.g., one that satisfies the "Goldstein-Armijo" conditions <ref> [ Dennis and Schnabel, 1983 ] </ref> . Unfortunately, a more sophisticated line search would likely result in greater use of the exact objective function e (x), and correspondingly greater computational expense.

Reference-contexts: A number of investigators have recently developed knowledge-based methods for using multiple models to reason about physical systems. A technique known as "compositional modeling" has emerged as the dominant paradigm for this research <ref> [ Falkenhainer and Forbus, 1991 ] </ref> . In compositional modeling, each model is constructed from a library of model fragments. An entire space of models results from systematically enumerating combinations of model fragments. <p> Most of this work has taken considerations of gross relevance as the sole criterion for selecting among models <ref> [ Falkenhainer and Forbus, 1991 ] </ref> , [ Nayak, 1994 ] .

Reference-contexts: In contrast to our work, considerations of numerical accuracy are not used at all to guide the choice of a suitable model. Methods of using multiple models to assure the quality of numerical simulations are reported 32 by our colleague in <ref> [ Gelsey, 1995 ] </ref> . This work is similar to ours inasmuch as we both used the yacht domain and the PMARC code as experimental testbeds; however, this work focused on improving the reliability of simulations of individual designs.

Reference-contexts: This allows optimization to continue when such failures are encountered; however, it introduces sharp discontinuities into the objective function. These pathologies make optimization from a single seed extremely unreliable, even for finding a local optimum <ref> [ Gill et al., 1981 ] </ref> . A commonly used remedy is to conduct many optimizations, from randomly selected seeds; however, this approach dramatically raises the already high cost of optimization. In order to make reliable yacht design optimization feasible, some alternative must be found.

Reference-contexts: Since @ 2 ^e (x; s)=@ x 2 = @ 2 ^e s (x)=@ x 2 , this guarantees uniqueness of the local minimum of ^e s (x). (This argument was taken from <ref> [ Kachiyan, 1997 ] </ref> ). We may think of the function I (s) as representing the InnerOptimization routine in strategy M LM 2 . <p> Applying the Cauchy criterion again, it follows that series (s 0 ; s 1 ; : : : ; s i ; : : :) converges to a limit s l . (This proof was taken from <ref> [ Kachiyan, 1997 ] </ref> .) Under the assumptions of our original correctness and convergence theorems, it is also possible to prove that a point s in [ l; u] is a local optimum of e (x) if and only if s is a fixed point of C (s), provided the threshold

Reference-contexts: By so incorporating the rating constraint into the VPP program, we formulate the yacht design problem as unconstrained minimization of the course time function T (x). Numerical optimization codes offer a direct method of attempting to solve the yacht design problem. One such code is CFSQP <ref> [ Lawrence et al., 1995 ] </ref> . <p> that the two procedures InnerOptimization and LineSearch are analogous to two computation steps that occur in optimization codes based on Newton or Quasi-Newton methods: (1) constructing and optimizing a quadratic approximation of the objective function; (2) conducting a line search between the start and end points of the quadratic optimization <ref> [ Lawrence et al., 1995 ] </ref> . 11 The line search procedure is especially important in applications, such as the yacht domain, in which the code that evaluates the exact objective function e (x) may fail to return a value in some regions of the design space.

Reference-contexts: Our experiments relied on CFSQP to carry out all the underlying numerical optimizations required by the strategies we tested. Of course, we could have used any one of a large number of other codes for this purpose. A good survey of optimization software is found in <ref> [ More and Wright, 1993 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: Another portion of this work has attempted to use numerical methods in combination with rule-based inference to guide the search for an optimal design <ref> [ Tong, 1990 ] </ref> , [ Powell, 1990 ] . This work is similar to ours inasmuch as we are both motivated, in part, by a desire to deal with pathological objective functions.

Reference-contexts: It can also be approximated by a simple algebraic formula. Likewise, wave resistance Rw can be computed using a slender-body flow code called "SLAW" <ref> [ Weems et al., 1994 ] </ref> . It can also be approximated by a formula that interpolates data from wave tank tests. Such internal approximations are not available to purely numerical optimization methods.

Reference-contexts: In this context, methods of dependency tracing suffice for deciding on which model to use to answer a given query. More sophisticated methods reason about the sign of the error of approximate models [ Addanki et al., 1991 ] , <ref> [ Weld, 1990 ] </ref> . In contrast to our work, considerations of numerical accuracy are not used at all to guide the choice of a suitable model.

Reference-contexts: The second group of experiments was carried out using PMARC itself under the control of various design optimization strategies. In both groups of experiments, the necessary PMARC runs were set up using a fully automatic panelization system <ref> [ Yao and Gelsey, 1996 ] </ref> . The panelization program was run on a Sun Microsystems Sparcstation 2. PMARC itself was run on (one processor of) a three-processor DEC Alpha 2100.
