Abstract: Distributed audio and video applications require end-to-end performance guarantees from the underlying networks for smooth delivery of real-time media streams. The end-to-end nature dictates that real-time support be built into both wide-area and local-area networks. With the enormous growth of portable computers equipped with networking capabilities, it is important to develop real-time protocols for wireless LAN technologies, such that real-time audio/video communication services can be extended to these mobile terminals as well. This paper describes the implementation effort of supporting end-to-end performance guarantees over a heterogeneous local-area network comprising of both wired and wireless LAN segments. This work also addresses the performance guarantee issues associated with terminal mobility in the wireless segments. We also present performance measurements of our prototype to justify the various protocol design choices made.

Reference-contexts: Hence for the given parameter values, as long as a complete cell transition takes less than 1.58 sec, the network can switch to a new flow without the user noticing any interruption in service. 5. Related Work The IEEE 802.11 standard <ref> [1] </ref> is an emerging MAC standard that aims to provide real-time network access by switching channel access modes for CSMA/CA LANs. 802.11 switches to a polled mode of operation to support performance guarantees, which is reported not to perform very well [4] [8].

The wired backbone is a high speed network with wireless picocells.

Reference-contexts: The absence of such technology prohibits the realization of the vision of end-to-end desktop-to-desktop audio/video communication, because the network performance on the "last mile" to the desktops is not guaranteed. REther <ref> [10] </ref> is a software-based token passing protocol that bridges this gap by providing performance guarantees for real-time applications on existing Ethernet hardware infrastructure.

Section 6 concludes this paper with a summary of the main results and an outline of on-going work. 2. REther: A Real-Time Ethernet Protocol An Ethernet segment running REther <ref> [10] </ref> can be in one of two modes. In the absence of real-time flows, the network is in the CSMA mode and the nodes contend for channel access using the CSMA/CD protocol. When the first real-time flow is initiated, the network transparently switches to the Token Passing mode.

Introduction In wide-area networks emerging reservation protocols such as RSVP <ref> [14] </ref> together with real-time packet scheduling mechanisms in the routers, promise performance guarantees on IP-based networks. The circuit-switching nature of public telephone networks also offers a viable alternative for performance guarantees over a large geographical area. However, real-time performance guarantees for popular LAN technologies such as Ethernet are conspicuously missing.
