Abstract: Several routing schemes proposed for ad hoc networks assume that all mobile hosts have the same transmission power and bandwidth constraints. However, in real world, this assumption may often not be true since there exist many types of mobile hosts with different transmission capacity and mobility rate. This paper discusses a new ad hoc network architecture, called `Physically Hierarchical Ad hoc Networks' where two kinds of mobile hosts form the ad hoc network hierarchy: Super Mobile Hosts(Super-MHs) and Mini Mobile Hosts (Mini-MHs). The paper presents a protocol for routing in such a network. The protocol is based on the idea that most communication between Mini-MHs can be provided through a Super-MH playing the role of mobile base station for Mini-MHs.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction An ad hoc network is defined as "a collection of wireless mobile hosts forming a temporary network without the aid of any centralized administration or standard support services regularly available on the wide-area network to which the hosts may normally be connected" <ref> [1] </ref>. In order to develop a routing protocol suited for such an environment, several routing approaches focusing on unicast datagram routing have been proposed in the recent years. In general, routing approaches for ad hoc networks can be divided into two categories. <p> One type is to modify existing DBF (Distributed Bellman-Ford) routing algorithms to get optimal routes in a dynamic topology [2, 3, 4]. Another type uses an on-demand system, which is operated in two phases: route-discovery and route-maintenance <ref> [1, 5, 6, 7] </ref>. In DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) proposed in [1], a route from the source to the destination is dynamically determined by the results of a route discovery protocol without periodic router advertisement in the protocol. <p> One type is to modify existing DBF (Distributed Bellman-Ford) routing algorithms to get optimal routes in a dynamic topology [2, 3, 4]. Another type uses an on-demand system, which is operated in two phases: route-discovery and route-maintenance [1, 5, 6, 7]. In DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>, a route from the source to the destination is dynamically determined by the results of a route discovery protocol without periodic router advertisement in the protocol. Dube et al.[5] compare various protocols' routing types, criteria for selecting routes, and overhead. <p> Figure 7 shows an example for scenario C. Route Selection Scheme at a Super-Mobile Host In many existing ad hoc routing protocols, the best route among a set of possible routes from the source to the destination is utilized. For instance, DSR <ref> [1] </ref> and Lightweight Mobile Routing (LMR)[17] is described as simply selecting the route contained in the first arriving route request packet. DSDV [3] provides only a single path for routing between each given source/destination pair. <p> Route Request Cancellation Phase In ad hoc networks, network bandwidth, battery power, and available CPU processing time on each hosts are likely to be limited resources <ref> [1] </ref>. Consequently, useless packets in networks unnecessarily increase the overhead for processing it. <p> A good routing protocol for ad hoc networks should have a low communication overhead, by minimizing route setup and maintenance messages [5]. This is because the expence of excessive radio bandwidth consumption is clearly undesirable in ad hoc networks. The DSR <ref> [1] </ref> is limited in that, if the rate of topological change becomes higher, the amount of control packets broadcasted in the route maintenance phase also become larger.

Another type uses an on-demand system, which is operated in two phases: route-discovery and route-maintenance [1, 5, 6, 7]. <p> Thus, the scalability of "flat" routing protocols is limited by time or communication complexity. Hierarchical clustering in ad hoc networks is motivated because networks are somewhat clustered naturally, and a hierarchy improves scalability by providing a localization mechanism [9]. Several algorithms using clustering techniques have also been proposed <ref> [2, 10, 11, 12, 13] </ref>. All existing schemes are "logically" hierarchical routing scheme in that, physically, all mobile hosts are still assumed to have the same small transmission range, relative to the size of the network. This is indeed true in many circumstances.

Like the ABR approach, in Signal Stability based Adaptive Routing (SSA) protocol <ref> [5] </ref>, the first arriving route among routes through the most stable area of the network is chosen.

The DSR [1] is limited in that, if the rate of topological change becomes higher, the amount of control packets broadcasted in the route maintenance phase also become larger. <p> This method utilizies the property of 'Associativity', which is based on the idea that an intermediate mobile host's high association with its neighbor exhibits a high degree of node's stability. In SSA <ref> [5] </ref>, the signal quality of the channel is used as a route selection criteria by the destination as well as stability of individual hosts.

However, if the overhead associated with providing multipath routing is significant, then it makes any routing protocol impractical for this environment as well.

Reference-contexts: An ad hoc network where all mobile hosts are "equal", and there is no logical cluster, is said to be a flat architecture. Routing in flat architecture is not scalable <ref> [8] </ref>. Thus, the scalability of "flat" routing protocols is limited by time or communication complexity. Hierarchical clustering in ad hoc networks is motivated because networks are somewhat clustered naturally, and a hierarchy improves scalability by providing a localization mechanism [9].

Reference-contexts: one can envisage situations where the network may include hosts with significantly more bandwidth and/or transmission range. (We refer to such hosts as Super-MHs.) As a matter of fact, mobile hosts in an ad hoc network can be envisioned as having a "physically" hierarchical structure in terms of transmission capacity <ref> [14] </ref>. A fleet of ships in a naval task force is a good example of having physically hierarchical structure since it consists of slow ships with high transmission capacity and fast boats with low transmission capacity. A company in military environments is another example.

Reference-contexts: In ad hoc networks, the communication connectivity is fairly "weak", as any migration by mobile hosts participating in a route will cause the route to become invalid. Moreover, their quality is highly sensitive to environmental conditions including: the distance and terrain between mobile hosts, externally generated noise <ref> [15] </ref>. Therefore, some route determined by routing protocols for a traditional ad hoc network may not work quite often, in result it causes an overhead for frequently finding a new route and wastes of network bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: As far as velocity, Mini-MHs in this example are faster than a Super-MH. Parameters Mini-MH Super-MH Transmit Capacity Small Large Moving Speed Fast Slow Table 1: Classification of mobile hosts by parameters Quite often, low-mobility environments are associated with high bandwidths and high-mobility environments with relatively lower bandwidths <ref> [16] </ref>. Therefore, in our architecture, Super-MHs are assumed to have lower mobility than Mini-MHs. As a matter of fact, it is expected that a layer of hierarchy in ad hoc network architecture can be subdivided if we consider more parameters that affect the classification of mobile hosts' types.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, an IRD packet needs to contain the destination Mini-MH's ID as well as Super-MHs' ID. It can be thought as a kind of Multidestination routing algorithm, in which each packet contains a list of destinations <ref> [18] </ref>. The IRD packet has the format shown in Figure 4. Upon receiving an IRD packet for the Super-MH, any intermediate Mini-MHs checks to see if the address field for the destination Mini-MH matches with its own address.
