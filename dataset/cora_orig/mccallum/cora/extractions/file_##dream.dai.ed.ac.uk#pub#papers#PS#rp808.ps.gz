Abstract: ing between abstraction levels. Unlike previous approaches which reasoned about plans directly, we simulate the planning process numerically. Our model is based upon an analogy with electrical resistance. It is both fast and simple. The simplicity of our approach allows us to guarantee various theoretical properties hold lacking in previous approaches. In particular, the abstraction hierarchies constructed by our method satisfy two simple "monotonicity" properties. These ensure that the harder preconditions are achieved in the higher abstract levels. These monotonicity properties limit the amount of backtracking required between abstraction levels. We have compared our method with those in the ALPINE and HIGHPOINT procedures. Using a comprehensive set of experiments, we have demonstrated that the hierarchies constructed are better than those generated by ALPINE and HIGH-POINT. In addition, our method builds these hierarchies rapidly. Giunchiglia, F., and Walsh, T. 1991. Using abstraction.
