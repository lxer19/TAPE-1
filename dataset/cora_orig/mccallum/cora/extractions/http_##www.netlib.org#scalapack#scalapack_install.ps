Abstract: This working note describes how to install and test version 1.5 of ScaLAPACK. This release of ScaLAPACK extends the functionality of the package by providing new routines for band systems of linear equations and the singular value decomposition. These two-dimensional distributed memory versions of common LAPACK routines rely on calls to the BLAS for local computation, and calls to the PBLAS for global computations. For portability concerns, communication takes place inside the PBLAS through calls to the BLACS. The design of the testing/timing programs for the ScaLAPACK codes is also discussed.
