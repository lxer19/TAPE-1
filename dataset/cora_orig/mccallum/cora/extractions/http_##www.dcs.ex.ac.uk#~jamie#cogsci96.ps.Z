Title: A Connectionist Architecture with Inherent Systematicity  
Author: James Henderson

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Exeter  
Abstract: For connectionist networks to be adequate for higher level cognitive activities such as natural language interpretation, they have to generalize in a way that is appropriate given the regularities of the domain. Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) identified an important pattern of regularities in such domains, which they called systematicity. Several attempts have been made to show that connectionist networks can generalize in accordance with these regularities, but not to the satisfaction of the critics. To address this challenge, this paper starts by establishing the implications of systematicity for connectionist solutions to the variable binding problem. Based on the work of Hadley (1994a), we argue that the network must generalize information it learns in one variable binding to other variable bindings. We then show that temporal synchrony variable binding (Shas-tri and Ajjanagadde, 1993) inherently generalizes in this way. Thereby we show that temporal synchrony variable binding is a connectionist architecture that accounts for systematicity. This is an important step in showing that connectionism can be an adequate architecture for higher level cognition.

Reference-contexts: Thus currently only temporal synchrony variable binding implies that learned parameters are inherently independent of variable bindings, as required by systematicity. Tensor product variable binding (Smolensky, 1990) and relative-position encoding <ref> (Barnden and Srinivas, 1991) </ref> use the space dimension to represent variable bindings. Using such a representation, variable bindings are represented by specifying the units where the computation should take place. <p> Signatures (Lange and Dyer, 1989), CONSYDERR (Sun, 1992), and pattern-similarity association <ref> (Barnden and Srinivas, 1991) </ref> use the activation level dimension to represent variable bindings. This complicates the nature of computation in the network, since activation level is also being used to represent what features a variable's entity has.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, temporal synchrony variable binding by its very nature makes learned parameters independent of variable bindings. By showing this we show that temporal synchrony variable binding is a connectionist architecture that can account for systematicity. The Definition of Systematicity Although neither (Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988) nor <ref> (Fodor and McLaughlin, 1990) </ref> provides a precise definition of system-aticity, the concept is meant to embody the pervasive regularities in language (and thought) that are traditionally captured using compositional generative grammars. Such grammars express generalizations about the sentences of a language in terms of their subconstituents.

Reference-contexts: Hadley (1994a; 1994b) discusses a fourth type of systematic-ity which does this. He defines semantic systematicity to be strong systematicity plus the requirement that the system assign appropriate meanings to all words occurring in the novel test sentences <ref> (Hadley, 1994b) </ref>. The task of assigning meaning forces the system to make distinctions between syntactic positions.

Reference-contexts: Because there has not been general agreement about the exact definition of systematicity, this paper starts with a discussion of this issue based on the work of Hadley (1994a). The resulting definition of systematicity requires a solution 1 One proposal <ref> (Hadley and Hayward, 1995) </ref> has not yet been criticized in the literature. <p> For those who aren't satisfied with an in-principle argument, see the discussion below of <ref> (Hadley and Hayward, 1995) </ref>. Their experimental results can be interpreted as evidence for the generalization ability of temporal synchrony variable binding networks. 2 tion of variable bindings are rather different from the require-ments it places on the representation of words and syntactic positions.

The parallel between the use of time in recurrent networks and the use of time in temporal synchrony variable binding means that methods for training recurrent networks can be generalized to temporal synchrony variable binding networks.

Reference-contexts: For example, some constraints on long distance dependencies in natural language (wh- movement) can be explained by the inability of simple temporal synchrony variable binding networks to generalize over pairs of constituents <ref> (Henderson, 1994b) </ref>. By accounting for these particular phenomena at the implementation level, the classical competence theory of long distance dependencies is greatly simplified. Because temporal synchrony variable binding helps bridge the gap between low level biological evidence and high level cognitive phenomena, more such insights are likely in the future. <p> Even now it is abundantly clear that temporal synchrony variable binding is not merely an implementation of a classical computational architecture. 8 For a more thorough presentation of temporal synchrony variable binding and how it can be used to implement a syntactic parser, see either (Henderson, 1994a) or <ref> (Henderson, 1994b) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: They pointed out a pattern of regularities in higher level cognitive activities that they called systematicity, and challenged con-nectionists to show how this pattern could be accounted for within connectionism. In this paper we show that a particular connectionist architecture, called temporal synchrony variable binding <ref> (Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1993) </ref>, accounts for systematicity through its inherent ability to generalize across entities. In the process, we clarify the notion of systematic-ity and show its implications for variable binding techniques. <p> One such investigation developed a technique called temporal synchrony variable binding for use in fast, common sense reasoning (reflexive reasoning) <ref> (Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1993) </ref>. 2 This technique can represent multiple features of multiple entities, and it can perform a significant class of computations over this representation. In addition to reflexive reasoning, it has been successfully applied to syntactic natural language parsing (Hen-derson, 1994b; Henderson, 1994a). <p> As pointed out by Tesar and Smolensky (1994), temporal synchrony variable binding can be interpreted as an implementation of tensor product variable binding. 6 In addition, there is some evidence that temporal synchrony is used in the brain to do variable binding (see <ref> (Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1993) </ref> pages 439-441 for a discussion). Thus if we assume that the variable binding component of Hadley and Hayward's network is an abstract representation of a temporal synchrony variable binding mechanism, then the mere implementation criticism is addressed. More arguments against this criticism will be given below. <p> However, systematicity still requires learned parameters to be independent of these bindings. Because these bindings are represented using space, they pose the same problems as using space to represent variable bindings. Temporal synchrony variable binding <ref> (Shastri and Ajjana-gadde, 1993) </ref> is currently the only proposal for how to use the time dimension to represent variable bindings. In this model, a variable binding is represented by specifying the times during which the computations involving the variable should take place. <p> The biological evidence for temporal synchrony variable binding has also been used to explain other cognitive phenomena that were previously described in classical terms, such as Miller's (1956) bound on short term memory of seven plus or minus two things <ref> (Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1993) </ref>. Furthermore, the less abstract level of description provided by temporal synchrony variable binding has provided insights into cognitive phenomena that have not been achieved at the classical level. <p> Some complications arise when it is necessary to learn when to introduce new entities, but these are orthoganal to the issue of system-aticity. Methods for effective learning in temporal synchrony variable binding networks is an area of active research by the author and Shastri. Conclusion Temporal synchrony variable binding <ref> (Shastri and Ajjana-gadde, 1993) </ref> is a connectionist method for representing multiple entities, each with multiple features. It uses the time dimension to represent the binding between the different features of a given entity (i.e. variable bindings).
