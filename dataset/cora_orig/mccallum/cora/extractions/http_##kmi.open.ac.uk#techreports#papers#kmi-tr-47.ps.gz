Abstract: We describe a system which uses an agent-based approach to support teaching in the collaborative setting of asynchronous plaintext electronic conferencing. We have identified areas within which tutors who use conferencing need support and developed a system which provides help in an opportunistic manner. The agent we have developed uses a case-based approach to instruction by offering help on common student problems. The cases used are examples of problems experienced by students in previous years and discussions of how they were resolved. These cases are presented by the agent when it identifies an appropriate point in the conference. An experimental version of this agent, which we call the Virtual Participant (VP), has been tested on the Open University MBA course Creative Management. We review the effect of the system and the lessons to be learned from this experiment.

Reference-contexts: Through this it produces a multiuser system which gives access to contextually relevant discussions. D e s i g n The development plan for this system involves two prototypes. The first prototype was given the user name Uncle Bulgaria <ref> [1] </ref> and was given access to the coursework conferences of the B882 course. Assessment of our prototype identified some important lessons which are reported in the evaluation section. The second prototype is being developed with these in mind and is described in the current work section.
