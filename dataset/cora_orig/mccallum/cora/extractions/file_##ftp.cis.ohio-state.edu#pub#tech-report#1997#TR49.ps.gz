Abstract: Computer networks are an efficient, inexpensive, convenient and fast mode of communication and information transfer. There is widespread demand for the ability to buy and sell goods, especially electronic, using this medium. Sales over computer networks is also referred to as electronic commerce. A protocol for electronic commerce transactions is the series of steps that two parties must follow in order to transact business successfully. There are various issues that arise while designing electronic commerce protocols: how can one party be prevented from disappearing with the money/goods in the middle of a transaction? How can a party establish its identity without revealing personal information to unknown and untrusted parties? How can we prevent a third party from "stealing" money from the network? All these and other problems make designing an electronic commerce protocol both challenging and interesting. In this paper, we first present a protocol for electronic commerce transactions between an anonymous customer and a merchant whose identity is public. Tampering with the protocol, either by the involved parties or by an intruder, does not cost the merchant or the customer more than some additional computation. Furthermore, under all circumstances, the transaction is either completed (the right amount of money is exchanged for the right goods) or aborted (there is no transfer of money or goods). In other words, the protocol ensures anonymity, security, and atomicity in business transactions. We also propose a protocol for electronic auctions. The auction protocol has the same properties of anonymity, security, and atomicity as the transaction protocol. We extend these two protocols to apply to real-time transactions where goods (such as stocks, bonds, options, etc.) must be transferred within a stipulated period of time.

Reference-contexts: An electronic commerce transaction is the exchange of goods for money over electronic networks. A protocol in electronic commerce is a series of steps required to successfully complete an electronic commerce transaction. Several properties have been identified as either required or desirable in protocols for transactions in electronic commerce <ref> [NM95, And94] </ref>.

There is a limited form of anonymity. iKP: This family of protocols, designed by IBM <ref> [BGH + 95] </ref>, emphasizes on the security of transactions. The protocol works as follows: the merchant and customer agree upon the price and the product to be exchanged.

Ecash: Ecash, a system designed by DigiCash [Dig], emphasizes on privacy and anonymity <ref> [Cha92] </ref> of the customer. The protocol works as follows: the customer withdraws an ecash coin from the bank. The customer pays a merchant by sending a function of the coin and an arbitrary number provided by the merchant.

Reference-contexts: However, Bob's true identity is known. Alice also has the product advertisement, acknowledgement of her payment, and the encrypted product. Therefore, she can prove Bob's wrongdoing in front of an arbitrator <ref> [CS96] </ref> and demand that the right product be delivered. This ensures that goods are delivered if and only if the payment is made. In other words, the protocol is atomic.

Reference-contexts: Privacy, anonymity, and low overhead cost, on the other hand, are desirable features. While many protocols exist for electronic commerce, none has all the five features listed above. Some of them emphasize anonymity and privacy at the cost of atomicity <ref> [Dig] </ref>, others emphasize atomicity, but do not provide anonymity [ST95]. Although, these protocols are suitable for specific situations in the commerce, there is a need for a general protocol that is suitable for most situations. In addition, most existing electronic commerce protocols do not handle auctions. <p> Section 5 describes a protocol for auction over electronic networks.

Reference-contexts: In addition, most existing electronic commerce protocols do not handle auctions. When they do, they allow only a very simplified version of auction with no more than one round of bidding <ref> [FR95] </ref>. Auctions are an important and common form of commerce today. A difficult aspect of auctions is that the bidder must be present at the site of the auction. This reduces the appeal of auction and restricts the number of people who would otherwise participate in it. <p> These customers will, however, constitute a large part of the trade conducted electronically. Our general transaction protocol, caters 16 to customers with a variety of interests and requirements and hence is more general in its application. There is very little work previously done on auction protocols. The protocol in <ref> [FR95] </ref> is the only extensive work towards implementing electronic auctions. [FR95] ensures security and anonymity but not atomicity. Furthermore, customers may only bid once. Our protocol, on the other hand, meets all the five requirements described in Section 1 and allows multiple rounds of bidding. <p> Our general transaction protocol, caters 16 to customers with a variety of interests and requirements and hence is more general in its application.

Reference-contexts: This guarantees anonymity. Overhead Cost The above protocol does not require any complex computation. Furthermore, there are only five messages exchanged between the customer and the merchant. Therefore, the cost incurred is nominal <ref> [GS96] </ref>. Non-Electronic Goods With some minor modifications, the protocol can be extended to non-electronic goods. In Step 3, instead of sending an encrypted product, Bob only acknowledges the receipt of the encrypted payment.

Reference-contexts: We assume the existence of some acceptable electronic form of payment such as a credit card number, an electronic coin withdrawn from a bank, or any other electronic entity that does not compromise the customer's anonymity. In electronic commerce, we also assume the existence of trusted third parties <ref> [KGM96, Ket95] </ref>. The third parties facilitate anonymity by issuing pseudo-identities to customers. They may also issue credit cards that can be used by the customer for payment.

In addition, it does not ensure anonymity, since at least the NetBill server will be aware of all transactions made by the customer. DEC's Millicent: Millicent, a protocol designed at DEC <ref> [Man95] </ref>, emphasizes on low overhead cost. The protocol works as follows: a piece of "scrip" represents an account the customer has established with a vendor. At any given time, a vendor has outstanding scrip (open accounts) with the recently active customers.

Reference-contexts: For real-time transactions, it must be established if the product was indeed delivered within the stipulated period of time. If the product was not delivered within this period of time, the customer must be refunded his payment. We verify the time of delivery by timestamping <ref> [ST94] </ref> messages between the merchant and the customer. The parties involved, the resources at their disposal, their location are all exactly the same as in the situation with no time restrictions. We further assume that every customer is associated with a local trusted processor [YT95].
