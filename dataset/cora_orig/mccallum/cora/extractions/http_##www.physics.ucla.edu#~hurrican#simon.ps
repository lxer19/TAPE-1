Abstract: The spectrum of unstable perturbations of a simple magnetized atmosphere is studied. Magnetic field lines are straight, horizontal, and line tied to conducting walls at both ends. The temperature has horizontal variation across the field lines as well as vertical variation. The unstable spectrum close to marginal stability is found to be continuous from zero to a maximum growth rate. The structure of the unstable continuum modes is calculated in the dissipationless limit. The presence of singularities in the eigenfunction does not affect the growth rate significantly, nor does it lead to plasma heating. PACS 52.30, 52.35.P, 52.50

Reference-contexts: B. Stability Equations Applying the ordering scheme, Eqs. (5), to our evolution equations, Eqs. (2)-(4), yields a set of relations which can be solved order by order. The details of the procedures involved and the results of each order can be found in either Ref. [15] or Ref. <ref> [14] </ref>.

The form of this dissipation term comes from examining the viscosity term in the usual MHD momentum balance equation.

Presumably this means a fast variation across the field (since fast variation along the field must be stable) and the displacement must be perpendicular to the fast variation to avoid large compression. <p> We will probably explore this question more in the future, but for now we feel that our proof is rather unambiguous. The nonlinear explosive behavior of ballooning type modes (see Ref. [15] and <ref> [14] </ref>) will dominate most practical situations obscuring the details of the eigenmode discussed in this paper.

Hence the nonlinear phase would, for any reasonable initial perturbation, 12 arise before the eigenmode is assembled. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by NASA grant NRA-95-11-SSM-007 and U. S.
