Abstract: GP-COM is a genetic programming system based around this conceptual structure. Components in the system are loosely coupled and are defined only by their interfaces to other components. Components may be easily swapped to test potential improvements to the process, or to apply the system to a enw problem domain. The system consists of a collection of components glued together by high-level scripts.
