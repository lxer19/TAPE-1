Title: The Detour Framework for Packet Rerouting  
Author: Andy Collins 
Date: October 29, 1998  
Abstract: The Detour framework is a software infrastructure for alternative routing on the internet. It is being developed in conjunction with the Detour routing project, to serve as a mechanism for experimental deployment of new, performance-sensitive routing algorithms in the wide-area. The framework implements a virtual network that allows users of our system to take advantage of improved routing for real traffic, without harming non-Detour users. The framework consists of the basic mechanisms required for managing the virtual network and coordinating the activities of the various routing and congestion control algorithms running at each node. The performance is sufficient for our experimental needs, and some discussion of techniques for improving performance is included.

Reference-contexts: Given the separation in the model, it is even possible to implement a flow database on top of a language-based classification engine such as DPF <ref> [Eng96] </ref>. We would like to explore this avenue in the future, and perhaps compare routing using modern language classifiers to routing using advanced data-structure classifiers. 5 Egress nodes Until now we have ignored the issue of how packets enter and leave the Detour domain from and to the normal internet.

Reference-contexts: The disadvantage is fairly obvious: its hard, and we need to solve it before we can scale to large networks. But work in the area of classification and route lookup has been advancing at an astounding rate in the last couple of years ([Bro97], [Wal97], [Sri98], <ref> [Lak98] </ref>), and there is every reason to believe that this group of researchers will continue to make progress.

Reference-contexts: As the evidence accumulated that an experimental egress node was in fact a good choice the weights on the routes leading to that egress could be increased. 5.2 Network address translation Return symmetry is guaranteed by the framework by performing network address translation <ref> [RFC1631] </ref> on the data packets at the egress node. Each node is assigned a pool of addresses to use for translation. These are assigned from the internet address space and globally routed to the node.

Reference-contexts: The measurement study in 2.1 is important to motivating the work in general, while the routing techniques in 2.2 and 2.3 are important because the role of the framework is to support these algorithms. Much of this work is documented in <ref> [Sav98] </ref>. Section 2.4 looks at virtual networks. Virtual networks have been a useful architecture for deploying new internet algorithms in the past, so we discuss some of the general principles.
