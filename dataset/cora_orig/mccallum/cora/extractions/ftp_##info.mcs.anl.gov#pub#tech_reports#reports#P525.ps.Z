Title: Block-Classified Motion Compensation Scheme for Digital Video  
Author: Sohail Zafar Member, IEEE Ya-Qin Zhang Senior Member, IEEE Bijan Jabbari Senior Member, IEEE 
Abstract: A novel scheme for block-based motion compensation is introduced in which a block is classified according to the energy that is directly related to the motion activity it represents. This classification allows more flexibility in controlling the bit rate and the signal-to-noise ratio and results in a reduction in motion search complexity. The method introduced is not dependent on the particular type of motion search algorithm implemented and can thus be used with any method assuming that the underlying matching criteria used is minimum absolute difference. It has been shown that the method is superior to a simple motion compensation algorithm where all blocks are motion compensated regardless of the energy resulting after the displaced difference.
