Abstract: Statistics of pitch have recently been used in speaker recognition systems with good results. The success of such systems depends on robust and accurate computation of pitch statistics in the presence of pitch tracking errors. In this work, we develop a statistical model of pitch that allows unbiased estimation of pitch statistics from pitch tracks which are subject to doubling and/or halving. We first argue by a simple correlation model and empirically demonstrate by QQ plots that clean pitch is distributed with a lognormal distribution rather than the often assumed normal distribution. Second, we present a probabilistic model for estimated pitch via a pitch tracker in the presence of doubling/halving, which leads to a mixture of three lognormal distributions with tied means and variances for a total of four free parameters. We use the obtained pitch statistics as features in speaker verification on the March 1996 NIST Speaker Recognition Evaluation data (subset of Switchboard) and report results on the most difficult portion of the database: the one-session condition with males only for both the claimant and imposter speakers. Pitch statistics provide 22% reduction in false alarm rate at 1% miss rate and 11% reduction in false alarm rate at 10% miss rate over the cepstrum-only system.

INTRODUCTION Statistics of pitch have recently been used as prosodic features in speaker recognition systems with good results and have proven to be more robust than cepstra to acoustic environmental mismatches <ref> [1] </ref>. Also, in the context of objective measures of speaker recognizability, pitch statistics have been shown to be among the best descriptors, mean pitch being the most descriptive feature [2]. <p> In this work, we address the problem of unbiased estimation of pitch statistics using data from imperfect pitch trackers subject to halving/doubling. Prior work <ref> [1] </ref> has assumed a Gaussian distribution for clean pitch and addressed the pitch doubling/halving by hard thresholded outlier elimination. Pitch histograms, however, reveal the skewed nature of the distribution. <p> DISTRIBUTION OF PITCH Prior work on pitch for speaker identification has assumed that pitch has a normal distribution <ref> [1] </ref>. Pitch histograms, such as the one in Figure 2 (a) for a single female talker, however, indicate that the pitch distribution is skewed. <p> Both test conditions over the 30-second duration utterances are reported. 7. RESULTS AND FUTURE WORK The LTM estimation produces a modest but consistent gain over iterative outlier elimination described in <ref> [1] </ref>. The speaker detection results for both techniques are shown in Fig. 5. LTM uses statistics of halved/doubled datapoints and also produces the ratio of pitch halving to integral pitch.

Reference-contexts: Regarding the pitch tracking errors, we propose a probabilistic model of pitch halving/doubling that results in a lognormal tied mixture distribution for the estimated pitch with four free parameters. We use an auditory model based pitch tracker <ref> [3] </ref> which uses a model of cochlear filtering to compute autocorrelation-like functions and dynamic programming for tracking and voiced/unvoiced decisions. We use the obtained pitch statistics in a parallel cepstrum/pitch speaker verification system and report results on the March 1996 NIST dataset. 2. <p> PITCH TRACKER The pitch tracker used in this work (see Fig. 1) is based on a model of cochlear filtering and computes autocorrelation-like functions of the pitch lag for multiple frequency bands followed by two stages of dynamic programing for pitch period estimation and voiced/unvoiced decisions <ref> [3] </ref>.
