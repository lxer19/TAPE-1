Abstract: We present an analysis of a class of attacks we call address spoofing. With the recent publicity surrounding an instance of such an attack, we have written up a presentation we gave nine months before the attack; we include an analysis of the recent attack. First, we present some fundamentals behind network communication and routing. Next we discuss the class of attacks we call address spoofing. We then give a real-world example of an attack in this class. Finally, we address some of the questions related to these attacks.

Reference-contexts: Predicting sequence numbers is discussed in [Morris 85] and <ref> [Bellovin 89] </ref> and was used in the recently publicized IP spoofing attack. Eve's second major goal is to prevent Alice from interfering with the attack. <p> Therefore, Eve had to use an artificial address as the sender of the requestone that would never reply to Alice's responses. Step 2: Predict what Bob's sequence number will be. The attackers approach is essentially the same as those described in [Morris 85] and <ref> [Bellovin 89] </ref>. Eve sent 2 0 connection attempts to Bob's remote shell server; the starting sequence number for each connection request incremented by a predictable value of 128,000.

Eve's second major goal is to prevent Alice from interfering with the attack. <p> The RST would have freed Alice's data structures. Therefore, Eve had to use an artificial address as the sender of the requestone that would never reply to Alice's responses. Step 2: Predict what Bob's sequence number will be.
