Title: Abstract  
Abstract: In this paper, we present a task-independent learning procedure which has previously been shown to produce gradual performance improvement on single perceptual-motor tasks. We demonstrate how this procedure can be applied to produce a class of executive process knowledge needed to realize expert performance on a dual-task combination. This procedure is a direct result of the constraints that occur when realistic perceptual and motor mechanisms (EPIC) are mated to a learning cognitive modeling architecture (Soar).

Reference-contexts: In this work, we revisit those issues and suggest a possible solution through the application a learning procedure initially used to demonstrate gradual singletask performance improvement (Chong, 1998). Previous Work Chong & Laird (1997) presented a hybrid architecture called EPICSoar. EPICSoar <ref> (Chong, 1995) </ref> is an attempt to get both the detailed predictions and explanations provided by the perceptual and motor processors of EPIC (an ability Soar does not possess) and the problem solving, planning, and learning capabilities of Soar (an ability EPIC does not possess) in a single system.

Reference-contexts: The research questions that of interest to us are What is the nature of the knowledge that defines the executive process, and, How can this knowledge be learned? In <ref> (Chong & Laird, 1997) </ref>, we took the first steps to address these questions, but left a few open i ssues. In this work, we revisit those issues and suggest a possible solution through the application a learning procedure initially used to demonstrate gradual singletask performance improvement (Chong, 1998). <p> The fact that no tracking commands are issued between the stim-onset and responded perceptual events is what characterizes this structure as a novice structure, analogous to the sequential task strategy discussed in <ref> (Chong & Laird, 1997) </ref>. <p> To our surprise, the final performance was in fact not the same. Unlike the final performance of the IS model (which was condition-dependent across all conditions), the IC model was condition-independent for the first two-thirds 5 The jam-recovery/avoidance learning procedure presented in <ref> (Chong & Laird, 1997) </ref> was also used. 6 The tracking task is not shown because the promotion styles cannot be applied to the tracking command s, per the promotion guidelines. 7 We show only the effect of learning on the tracking task because the Wickens task combination is really a study <p> The RMS error of the IS and IC models relative to observed data was 1.88 and 2.36 with a correlation of 0.89 and 0.74 respectively. These results agree with the empirical studies, so we tentatively accept our models differential behavior as correct. Discussion In <ref> (Chong & Laird, 1997) </ref>, we had no satisfactory hypothesis for the source of the fourth class; the strategic knowledge class. The purpose of this work was to address this omission. A task-independent promotion-learning procedure was presented that generates this knowledge. <p> We know though that the addition of the pipelined version of this rule was shown to significantly improved the tracking error <ref> (Chong & Laird, 1997) </ref>. One possible explanation is that m 3 is the product of a yet-to-bedeveloped strategy-generation procedure .

Reference-contexts: condition-dependence for the last third of the conditions. (The subtleties of the interactions in the model which cause this behavior cannot be reported due to space limitations.) In trying to reconcile this result with our expectations, we recalled a study on the use of varied task emphasis in dual-task learning <ref> (Gopher, 1993) </ref>. There, post-training performance was superior for subjects (VP) who were made to vary task priorities during training compared to subjects who were either in the equal-priority (EP) or no-priority (NP) groups.

Reference-contexts: It is generally thought that the role of the executive process is to 1) mediate the use of limited structural resources such as the sensors (eyes) and effectors (hands); and 2) ensure adherence to task priorities as specified in the task instructions <ref> (Meyer & Kieras, 1997a) </ref>.
