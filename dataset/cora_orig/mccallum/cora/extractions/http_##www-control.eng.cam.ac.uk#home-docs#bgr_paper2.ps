Reference-contexts: In this section, a heuristic approach to generating candidate functions explicitly is given. The computation is reminiscent of the inverse Lyapunov theorems developed in the papers by Willems [12], and by Hill and Moylan <ref> [4] </ref>. In fact, the present treatment captures the Lyapunov results by letting fl tend to infinity. The result is presented as an existence result, which in fact shows the relationship between state space stability (null input) and stability in the input/output sense.

Reference-contexts: Proof: This theorem is originally due to Willems ([11], [12]), however later work (as in James <ref> [5] </ref>) has studied the consequences of relaxing the smoothness conditions. 2 3 Lemma 2.9: For a system of the form given in Definition 2.1, the induced norm fl fl over any nontrivial set W 2 is greater than or equal to the H 1 norm of the linearised system at the

Reference-contexts: There are basic existence theorems, which are expressed in terms of the solution of dynamic programming problems. The paper by van der Schaft [10] (for example) makes use of such results. The paper by James <ref> [6] </ref>, discusses a generic algorithm to make such a computation, which is in fact applicable to this class of systems. In this section, a heuristic approach to generating candidate functions explicitly is given.

Reference-contexts: The reason for this restriction is not merely a technical one; rather it allows the study of a more interesting sets of problems (such as open loop unstable plants), as has been noted in recent literature (see the discussion in <ref> [7] </ref> and justification given in [9]). 2 Assumption 2.2: Let W 2 (N 1 ) L 2+ T L 1 be the set of L 2+ disturbance signals with a bound on their infinity norm: W 2 (N 1 ) = fw: w 2 L 2+ ; kwk 1 &lt; N

Reference-contexts: However, it should be noted that the same problem framework as this paper has been addressed in the recent work by Chitour, Liu, and Sontag in <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> However, for the most basic system where a comparison can be made (the plant being an integrator following the standard saturation, with unity negative feedback), the bound for the induced L 2+ norm given in <ref> [8] </ref> is conservative, whereas the technique given in this paper determines a tight bound. 2 Mathematical Preliminaries Definition 2.1: The operators whose norm we are measuring are the closed loop mappings (resp. x ), which are the mappings from the external disturbance w to z (resp. x), and 1 generated by

The author has successfully extended this technique to discrete time, using an alternative method of proof. This, and other related results, are documented in <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Proof: See <ref> [10] </ref>, and references therein. 2 The motivation for result and notation is that for systems of the class described in Theorem 3.1, (~) represents a maximising u (t) at the point ~. <p> There are basic existence theorems, which are expressed in terms of the solution of dynamic programming problems.

Reference-contexts: Extending these results to nonlinear systems has been a topic of recent interest, such as in the papers [3],[7],[8],[10]. In this paper, we are studying the case of single input linear systems with input saturation. By applying the concept of dissipativity introduced by Willems in <ref> [11] </ref>, we are able to reduce the problem to finding a (piecewise) smooth candidate function whose derivatives satisfy three differential inequalities. For a subclass of closed loop systems, a technique is presented to calculate a valid candidate function.
