Abstract: Picture Retrieval (PR) problem is concerned with retrieving pictures that are relevant to users' requests from a large collection of pictures, referred to as the picture database. We use the term picture in a very general context to refer to difierent types of images originating in disparate application areas. The sources for these images range from satellites, diagnostic medical imaging, architectural and engineering drawings, geographic maps, mugshot images of criminals, to family photographs and portraits. A computer system that facilitates picture retrieval is referred to as the Picture Retrieval System (PRS). The application areas that consider picture retrieval as a principal activity are both numerous and disparate. As diverse as the application areas are, there seems to be no consensus as to what a picture retrieval system really is. Consequently, the features of the existing picture retrieval systems have essentially evolved from domain speciflc considerations. The interdisciplinary interest in the PR problem has contributed research results on various aspects of the problem. However, the investigations leading to these research results were carried out quite independently and often from application speciflc concerns. As a consequence, it has become very di-cult to assess the real progress in PR systems. Furthermore, often there is a duplication of research efiort. In this survey paper, we attempt to provide a unifled view of the evolution of PR systems. We trace the origin and developments in this area from a unifled perspective. To achieve this objective, it is essential that we consider image processing functions (which are very often domain dependent) of PR systems and their retrieval functions as two orthogonal issues. We provide a taxonomy under which various approaches to the PR problem can be compared and contrasted. Several representative PR systems are classifled under the proposed taxonomy. Finally, key research problems that need to be addressed for developing truly general purpose PR systems are identifled and future research directions are indicated.

Reference-contexts: The system architecture is shown in Figure 2. Query speciflcation for the formatted view of picture data is through the user interaction with the system by using either a set of simple commands or SQL. For example, in ELAS System <ref> [2] </ref>, commands exist for retrieving LANDSAT images based on attribute values such as date of image acquisition, geographic area represented by the image, spectral channel number, percentage of cloud cover, among others. <p> PDBMS under this category are similar to the second category of systems under Tamura and Yokoya's classiflcation and the flrst generation systems under Grosky and Mehrotra's classiflcation. Some representative systems under this category include MIDAS [119], REDI [28], IMAID [27], PICDMS [38, 95, 22], VICAR-IBIS [20], ELAS <ref> [2] </ref>, PDB [114], I See [53], ERDAS [1], ARC/INFO [124], GRASS [3], SAND [7, 8], and GENTLE [50].

Reference-contexts: Learned knowledge is represented with constrained programs. ACORN can generate scenes from spatial relational descriptions and can describe spatial relations in new image instances using the learned spatial knowledge. A picture retrieval system based on relevance feedback techniques used in bibliographic information retrieval is proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>. The initial query is stated in textual form. The user browses the retrieved pictures and provides relevance feedback to the system. <p> Additionally, incremental query speciflcation and reflnement through interactive involvement of the user to resolve any ambiguities and/or imprecision in the query speciflcation itself [82, 99, 73] or during query processing in the form of providing relevance feedback on the initial retrieval results is suggested <ref> [73, 4, 96] </ref>. The recent approaches [74, 77, 129, 62, 93] attempts to bridge the gap between the image interpretation and the database approaches by introducing the notion of logical representations.

Reference-contexts: To provide retrieval to such distributed picture collections in a way that is transparent to the user necessitates a general picture retrieval system to address the distributed aspects. More speciflcally, three issues will be of interest in this context - information flltering techniques [112] and user modeling <ref> [5] </ref>, "thumbnail" representation of pictures, and progressive display of pictures. Information flltering and user modeling techniques will help in incrementally reflning the user retrieval need starting from a general and often vague user query description.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that both spatial sequence and temporal sequence images occur in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) domain also. Therefore, a picture data model should feature modeling constructs both for multiple physical representations and image sequences. Compression of image sequences by iconic indexing is discussed in <ref> [9] </ref>. 4.4 Object Recognition and Feature Extraction Though object recognition task has been carried out automatically in industrial applications, it becomes extremely impractical in image database systems due to the following. In industrial applications, objects to be recognized are limited to few domain objects.

Reference-contexts: Support for modeling image sequences is provided. Sequences can be based on spatial contiguity of images or images of the same geographic region recorded at difierent time points. An application of VIMSYS data model for interactive retrieval of face information is described in <ref> [10] </ref>. REMINDS is proposed as a generic image database management system that includes an image interpretation module [122]. Though the underlying data model is relational, REMINDS has several structural object orientation features. <p> In industrial applications, objects to be recognized are limited to few domain objects. Either models (in the case of model-driven approach) or feature trees (in the case of data-driven approach) are used to assist in this task <ref> [68, 67, 64, 10] </ref>. In several image database applications, since the objects to be recognized originate from disparate domains and images contain considerable noise, model-based or data-driven approaches to object recognition may not be highly useful.

Reference-contexts: POSTGRES, Starburst, and Gral are based on relational model while PROBE is based on functional model. On the other hand, the other approach considers even the data model as varying and a toolkit is provided for the construction of an application speciflc database system as demonstrated in GENESIS <ref> [11] </ref> and EXODUS [24] projects. See Table 1 for a comparative assessment of some of these systems. Extensible data models provide most exibility as far as the view (s) of picture data is concerned. Picture data can be represented as formatted, structured, complex, or unstructured data. <p> This naturally leads us to structure and evolve the system toward the approach featured by database generators such as EXODUS [24] and GENESIS <ref> [11] </ref>. Under GENESIS approach, functionality corresponding to each of the requirements of a general picture retrieval system constitutes a primitive building block. A General Picture Retrieval system is expected to provide facilities for describing how to combine these primitive building blocks to generate an application speciflc picture retrieval system.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea behind extensibility is to provide facilities for the (picture) database users to deflne their own application speciflc extensions. An extensible database system must support at least the facility for abstract data types. There are two emerging approaches to providing extensibility in database systems <ref> [12] </ref>. The flrst approach considers the data model as flxed and implements this data model as a system with well-deflned interfaces for user extensions as in POSTGRES [153], Starburst [150], Gral [78], and PROBE [115, 132].

An approach to picture retrieval based only on spatial relationships is proposed by Chang & Lee <ref> [26] </ref>. A Picture Description Language (PDL) based on Entity-Attribute-Relationship model is pro 18 posed in [111]. PDL allows for the logical description of objects, attributes of objects, relationships among objects, and events in a picture. Logical descriptions are manually derived. A parser generates SQL "insert" and "select" statements from PDL.

Reference-contexts: Typically, the query language used is that of the host DBMS such as SQL. Though Query by Pictorial Example (QPE) is the name of the query language for IMAID system proposed in <ref> [28] </ref>, this appears to be a misnomer since pictorial entities such as line segments are specifled by the actual coordinate values of the end points. In some implementations, the query language of the host system was extended for specifying an output device for picture display [160]. <p> PDBMS under this category are similar to the second category of systems under Tamura and Yokoya's classiflcation and the flrst generation systems under Grosky and Mehrotra's classiflcation.

Reference-contexts: Image queries are expressed either in textual form using keywords or in pictorial form using region icons. IIDS (Intelligent Image Database System) is a prototype image database system [32] based on a pictorial data structure called the 2D-String <ref> [36] </ref>. This system supports spatial reasoning, and visualization, in addition to the traditional image database operations. An extension of this work appears in [34]. An approach to picture retrieval based only on spatial relationships is proposed by Chang & Lee [26]. <p> possibly the difiering view points and interpretations of the domain users [96, 73]. 4.6 Spatial Similarity In application areas such as Real Estate Marketing and Satellite Imagery Matching , a major class of users' requests require retrieving those images in the database that are spatially similar to the query image <ref> [36, 32, 34, 71, 110, 166, 85, 104, 162] </ref>. We refer to this class of queries as Retrieval by Spatial Constraint (RSC) queries. In RSC queries, spatial relationships may span a broad spectrum ranging from directional relationships to adjacency, overlap, and containment involving a pair of objects to multiple objects.

Reference-contexts: The third category of systems have evolved from various application areas such as remote sensing, geographic data processing, and medical imaging. Also, Chock provides a survey and comparison of functionality of several image database systems for geographic applications <ref> [38] </ref>. Recently, Grosky and Mehrotra classify image database management systems into three categories/generations [65]. The systems in the flrst generation typically use a relational database management system to store attribute information about images. The image attributes are manually derived and inserted into the relational tables. <p> PDBMS under this category are similar to the second category of systems under Tamura and Yokoya's classiflcation and the flrst generation systems under Grosky and Mehrotra's classiflcation. Some representative systems under this category include MIDAS [119], REDI [28], IMAID [27], PICDMS <ref> [38, 95, 22] </ref>, VICAR-IBIS [20], ELAS [2], PDB [114], I See [53], ERDAS [1], ARC/INFO [124], GRASS [3], SAND [7, 8], and GENTLE [50]. See Table 1 for a comparative assessment of these systems.

Reference-contexts: The sheer number of the picture database systems make the task of analyzing and assessing the progress made in the area only more di-cult. For example, there exists more than flve hundred commercial systems for Geographic Information System and Computer Aided Design applications alone <ref> [58] </ref>. In view of this complexity, we have approached the problem of providing a unifled treatment on the evolution and the current state of PR systems from a difierent perspective than any of the previous surveys. <p> Despite recent advances in the database technology, Computer Aided Design systems continue to use flle-oriented representations and Geographic Information Systems rely on ad hoc database systems <ref> [58] </ref>. This situation is attributable primarily to the inherent limitations of the current data models and database management systems to cope with the complexity of the picture data representation, the diversity in the picture query speciflcation techniques, and the range of domain speciflc operations required.

A recent extension of this work appears in <ref> [61] </ref> and the system is referred to as MOODS (Modeling of Object Oriented Data Semantics). The system makes it possible for a user to dynamically guide the image interpretation task of an image through a series of transformations to derive semantic information of the image from the users perspective. <p> Recall that we refer to this approach as attribute based retrieval in section 2. As a natural outgrowth of the image interpretation approach, some researchers have recently proposed that the domain users be involved in interactively guiding the image interpretation task during query processing <ref> [65, 61, 77] </ref>. It is argued that this approach is essential for extracting domain semantic information from the images that may vary from one user to another user. In other words, the picture data model should make provisions for integrating domain dependent processing requirements into the data model.

Reference-contexts: A generic architecture for systems that embrace this approach is shown in Figure 4. Since the systems based on this approach appear to be promising, we describe them in some detail. A framework for image retrieval referred to as Adaptive Image Retrieval (AIR) is proposed in <ref> [70, 74] </ref>. AIR identifles flve major generic retrieval types: Retrieval by Browsing, Retrieval by Objective Attributes, Retrieval by Spatial Constraints, Retrieval by Shape Similarity, and Retrieval by Semantic Similarity. Retrieval by Browsing is a user-friendly interface for retrieving information from picture databases by employing techniques from visual languages. <p> Speciflcation of these attributes necessarily involves some subjectivity, imprecision and/or uncertainty. Retrieval by Semantic Attribute queries are formulated by using the semantic attributes. AIR framework has raised several interesting research issues and solutions to some of them are provided in <ref> [71, 141, 70, 73] </ref>. VIMSYS (Visual Information Management SYStem) is an objectoriented multilayer data model proposed exclusively for visual information (i.e., pictures, video, etc.) management [77]. VIMSYS data model has four layers. The flrst (i.e., the bottom) layer is used to model multiple physical representations for images. <p> This approach implies that the retrieval users are domain experts and may render the system domainspeciflc. To account for the difiering domain interpretations and the view points of the retrieval users, database researchers have advocated that these difierences in the interpretations be considered during the database design phase <ref> [141, 72, 70] </ref>. Additionally, incremental query speciflcation and reflnement through interactive involvement of the user to resolve any ambiguities and/or imprecision in the query speciflcation itself [82, 99, 73] or during query processing in the form of providing relevance feedback on the initial retrieval results is suggested [73, 4, 96]. <p> As in the case of spatial similarity, it is desirable that a pictorial data model provide the necessary constructs for specifying logical representations that would support Retrieval by Shape queries. 4.8 Semantic Similarity Retrieval by Semantic Attributes (RSA) represents a major generic retrieval class in picture retrieval applications <ref> [99, 70] </ref>. Simply stated, semantic attributes are those attributes that are used to describe the high-level domain concepts which the images manifest. Speciflcation of semantic attributes necessarily involves some subjectivity, imprecision, and/or uncertainty. Subjectivity arises due to difiering view points of the users about various domain aspects. <p> An exemplar picture may be specifled by assigning semantic attributes to the picture and/or its constituent objects in the sketch pad window (see Query Language/Interface section below) or by simply providing a set of semantic attributes in textual/graphical form <ref> [82, 70] </ref>. Personal Construct Theory [101] from the clinical psychology domain has been used as a knowledge elicitation tool for systematically deriving semantic attributes. An algorithm for RSA has been proposed in [73]. Cognition based approaches to semantic similarity are discussed in [99, 98, 82]. <p> Hence, an automated or semi-automated tool for discovering the set of attributes that are best suited for meeting the retrieval needs of a pictorial database application is essential. A tool for this task based on Personal 32 Construct Theory from the Clinical Psychology domain has been investigated in <ref> [141, 73, 70] </ref>. 4.12 System Architecture We envision a general purpose Picture Retrieval System to feature all of the functionality described above. Such a system will provide uniform access to large, heterogeneous, distributed picture collections.

Reference-contexts: This approach implies that the retrieval users are domain experts and may render the system domainspeciflc. To account for the difiering domain interpretations and the view points of the retrieval users, database researchers have advocated that these difierences in the interpretations be considered during the database design phase <ref> [141, 72, 70] </ref>. Additionally, incremental query speciflcation and reflnement through interactive involvement of the user to resolve any ambiguities and/or imprecision in the query speciflcation itself [82, 99, 73] or during query processing in the form of providing relevance feedback on the initial retrieval results is suggested [73, 4, 96].

Reference-contexts: Speciflcation of these attributes necessarily involves some subjectivity, imprecision and/or uncertainty. Retrieval by Semantic Attribute queries are formulated by using the semantic attributes. AIR framework has raised several interesting research issues and solutions to some of them are provided in <ref> [71, 141, 70, 73] </ref>. VIMSYS (Visual Information Management SYStem) is an objectoriented multilayer data model proposed exclusively for visual information (i.e., pictures, video, etc.) management [77]. VIMSYS data model has four layers. The flrst (i.e., the bottom) layer is used to model multiple physical representations for images. <p> Additionally, incremental query speciflcation and reflnement through interactive involvement of the user to resolve any ambiguities and/or imprecision in the query speciflcation itself <ref> [82, 99, 73] </ref> or during query processing in the form of providing relevance feedback on the initial retrieval results is suggested [73, 4, 96]. <p> Additionally, incremental query speciflcation and reflnement through interactive involvement of the user to resolve any ambiguities and/or imprecision in the query speciflcation itself [82, 99, 73] or during query processing in the form of providing relevance feedback on the initial retrieval results is suggested <ref> [73, 4, 96] </ref>. The recent approaches [74, 77, 129, 62, 93] attempts to bridge the gap between the image interpretation and the database approaches by introducing the notion of logical representations. <p> Similarity measures must consider aspects of an attribute such as the scale of measurement (i.e., nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio) [143] used and possibly the difiering view points and interpretations of the domain users <ref> [96, 73] </ref>. 4.6 Spatial Similarity In application areas such as Real Estate Marketing and Satellite Imagery Matching , a major class of users' requests require retrieving those images in the database that are spatially similar to the query image [36, 32, 34, 71, 110, 166, 85, 104, 162]. <p> Personal Construct Theory [101] from the clinical psychology domain has been used as a knowledge elicitation tool for systematically deriving semantic attributes.

An approach based on Rough Set Theory [135] is described in [96]. 4.9 Query Language/Interface Query language/interface for a general purpose Picture Retrieval System is essentially a sophisticated window- based graphical interface. <p> Hence, an automated or semi-automated tool for discovering the set of attributes that are best suited for meeting the retrieval needs of a pictorial database application is essential. A tool for this task based on Personal 32 Construct Theory from the Clinical Psychology domain has been investigated in <ref> [141, 73, 70] </ref>. 4.12 System Architecture We envision a general purpose Picture Retrieval System to feature all of the functionality described above. Such a system will provide uniform access to large, heterogeneous, distributed picture collections.

Reference-contexts: A generic architecture for systems that embrace this approach is shown in Figure 4. Since the systems based on this approach appear to be promising, we describe them in some detail. A framework for image retrieval referred to as Adaptive Image Retrieval (AIR) is proposed in <ref> [70, 74] </ref>. AIR identifles flve major generic retrieval types: Retrieval by Browsing, Retrieval by Objective Attributes, Retrieval by Spatial Constraints, Retrieval by Shape Similarity, and Retrieval by Semantic Similarity. Retrieval by Browsing is a user-friendly interface for retrieving information from picture databases by employing techniques from visual languages. <p> The recent approaches <ref> [74, 77, 129, 62, 93] </ref> attempts to bridge the gap between the image interpretation and the database approaches by introducing the notion of logical representations. <p> It should also be recognized that our notion of logical representations is more general than the views of data introduced by Lorie. In the latter, each view of picture data can be characterized by one or more logical representations. Furthermore, based on initial studies reported in <ref> [74] </ref>, it appears that by studying picture retrieval requirements of several disparate domains, a new taxonomy for views of picture data is likely to emerge as follows. First several generic retrieval classes will be identifled by systematically studying picture collections from disparate domains.

Reference-contexts: AIR framework has raised several interesting research issues and solutions to some of them are provided in [71, 141, 70, 73]. VIMSYS (Visual Information Management SYStem) is an objectoriented multilayer data model proposed exclusively for visual information (i.e., pictures, video, etc.) management <ref> [77] </ref>. VIMSYS data model has four layers. The flrst (i.e., the bottom) layer is used to model multiple physical representations for images. Multiple physical representations may be useful in some applications. For example, a region may be represented by its interior or by its boundary. <p> Recall that we refer to this approach as attribute based retrieval in section 2. As a natural outgrowth of the image interpretation approach, some researchers have recently proposed that the domain users be involved in interactively guiding the image interpretation task during query processing <ref> [65, 61, 77] </ref>. It is argued that this approach is essential for extracting domain semantic information from the images that may vary from one user to another user. In other words, the picture data model should make provisions for integrating domain dependent processing requirements into the data model. <p> The recent approaches <ref> [74, 77, 129, 62, 93] </ref> attempts to bridge the gap between the image interpretation and the database approaches by introducing the notion of logical representations. <p> Additionally, constructs should also exist to model relationships among objects within a picture (i.e., intra-object relationships) and relationships among objects of difierent pictures (i.e., inter-object relationships). The latter becomes important in modeling domain phenomena that may span across several pictures (i.e., image sequences) <ref> [77] </ref>. Modeling of picture sequences also become necessary to study phenomenon that changes over time. Each picture in such a sequence represents a snapshot of the phenomenon at a particular point in time. This requires the picture data model to provide support for modeling of temporal aspects. <p> modeling of text that may be associated with the pictures. 4.3 Multiple Physical Representations and Image Sequences As we have noted in section 3, often there is a need for multiple physical representations of the same picture since a given representation is e-cient for certain kinds of feature extraction tasks <ref> [77] </ref>. This is especially important to the approach advanced by the image interpretation researchers 26 since the query processor has to extract features from the physical representations during the query processing session. <p> Such an interface should be designed more as a knowledge-based system to guide the user through the query speciflcation process <ref> [77] </ref> and to elicit user relevance feedback during query processing. User relevance feedback on the initial retrieval results may be essential to resolve the inherent subjectivity and imprecision associated with semantic attributes.

Reference-contexts: There are two emerging approaches to providing extensibility in database systems [12]. The flrst approach considers the data model as flxed and implements this data model as a system with well-deflned interfaces for user extensions as in POSTGRES [153], Starburst [150], Gral <ref> [78] </ref>, and PROBE [115, 132]. POSTGRES, Starburst, and Gral are based on relational model while PROBE is based on functional model.

Reference-contexts: Many of the systems that employ objectoriented databases [103, 16, 25, 169] for picture retrieval may be loosely placed under this category <ref> [167, 79, 88, 105] </ref>. <p> A transformation module is provided to transform knowledge among these three classes. Once the pictorial semantic network (s) is constructed for a domain, it can be searched to retrieve relevant images.

Objects are specifled by closed spine curves and matching algorithms are based on histogram matching and correlation on wavelet-encoded images.

The user model reects the visual perception processes of the user. <p> Queries are specifled either in the textual form or in the graphical form. In the latter, a facial (query) image is composed by selecting and assembling graphic icons representing various anatomical parts of a face. A cognition-based approach to picture retrieval is proposed in [82, 99, 98]. In <ref> [99] </ref>, the retrieval model is based on both the picture model and the user model. The picture model represents the picture features that are signiflcant for retrieval. The user model reects the visual perception processes of the user. The cognitive model integrates both the picture model and the user model. <p> Additionally, incremental query speciflcation and reflnement through interactive involvement of the user to resolve any ambiguities and/or imprecision in the query speciflcation itself <ref> [82, 99, 73] </ref> or during query processing in the form of providing relevance feedback on the initial retrieval results is suggested [73, 4, 96]. <p> As in the case of spatial similarity, it is desirable that a pictorial data model provide the necessary constructs for specifying logical representations that would support Retrieval by Shape queries. 4.8 Semantic Similarity Retrieval by Semantic Attributes (RSA) represents a major generic retrieval class in picture retrieval applications <ref> [99, 70] </ref>. Simply stated, semantic attributes are those attributes that are used to describe the high-level domain concepts which the images manifest. Speciflcation of semantic attributes necessarily involves some subjectivity, imprecision, and/or uncertainty. Subjectivity arises due to difiering view points of the users about various domain aspects. <p> Personal Construct Theory [101] from the clinical psychology domain has been used as a knowledge elicitation tool for systematically deriving semantic attributes. An algorithm for RSA has been proposed in [73]. Cognition based approaches to semantic similarity are discussed in <ref> [99, 98, 82] </ref>. An approach based on Rough Set Theory [135] is described in [96]. 4.9 Query Language/Interface Query language/interface for a general purpose Picture Retrieval System is essentially a sophisticated window- based graphical interface.

Reference-contexts: Objects are specifled by closed spine curves and matching algorithms are based on histogram matching and correlation on wavelet-encoded images. An approach to retrieving similar images from NOVA satellite imagery collection is discussed in <ref> [104] </ref>. The notion of similarity is based on the shape and the spatial relationships among the objects (i.e., regions) in the satellite imagery. Images are modeled as attributed relational graphs and similarity is computed by graph matching. <p> possibly the difiering view points and interpretations of the domain users [96, 73]. 4.6 Spatial Similarity In application areas such as Real Estate Marketing and Satellite Imagery Matching , a major class of users' requests require retrieving those images in the database that are spatially similar to the query image <ref> [36, 32, 34, 71, 110, 166, 85, 104, 162] </ref>.

Pictorial semantic networks is proposed as a scheme for representing pictorial knowledge in <ref> [107] </ref>. Pictorial knowledge is grouped into three classes: angular, side, angular and side.

Reference-contexts: An extension of this work appears in [34]. An approach to picture retrieval based only on spatial relationships is proposed by Chang & Lee [26]. A Picture Description Language (PDL) based on Entity-Attribute-Relationship model is pro 18 posed in <ref> [111] </ref>. PDL allows for the logical description of objects, attributes of objects, relationships among objects, and events in a picture. Logical descriptions are manually derived. A parser generates SQL "insert" and "select" statements from PDL. <p> Therefore, there is a considerable scope for posing ad hoc queries on the picture database and to facilitate content based picture retrieval. However, it is well recognized that an automated approach to object recognition is a very di-cult problem <ref> [53, 111, 156, 59] </ref>. Furthermore, the problem is worsened if we assume that the objects to be recognized originate from disparate domains.

Reference-contexts: To provide retrieval to such distributed picture collections in a way that is transparent to the user necessitates a general picture retrieval system to address the distributed aspects. More speciflcally, three issues will be of interest in this context - information flltering techniques <ref> [112] </ref> and user modeling [5], "thumbnail" representation of pictures, and progressive display of pictures. Information flltering and user modeling techniques will help in incrementally reflning the user retrieval need starting from a general and often vague user query description.

Reference-contexts: Views of Picture Data Lorie classifles data that exists in the current application areas of advanced database systems into the following categories: formatted data, structured data, complex data, and unformatted data <ref> [113] </ref>. Formatted data refers to the data that is found in conventional database applications. 1 Each data item is a scalar type and the query language SQL (Structured Query Language) has become the standard for manipulating formatted data. <p> It should be noted that these four views were proposed by Lorie in the context of data that occurs in Computer Aided Design applications <ref> [113] </ref>. It should also be recognized that our notion of logical representations is more general than the views of data introduced by Lorie. In the latter, each view of picture data can be characterized by one or more logical representations.

Reference-contexts: Queries are modeled by selecting ranges on each of the semantic axes and thus it forms a subspace in the semantic space. Another approach to picture retrieval based on partitioning the database images into clusters based on their "visual" resemblance is presented in <ref> [131] </ref>. The partitioning of images is performed adaptively on the basis of the statistical properties of the user's query patterns. The grouping of similar images is expected to make the subsequent searches much faster. Explicit computation of statistics is avoided by employing a learning automata.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that the term PDM (or image data model) is often used in the literature to refer to low-level schemes (i.e., the representations that are closer to the image flle formats such as raster and vector) used for representing images <ref> [136] </ref>. Picture Retrieval Model (PRM): A PRM encompasses the speciflcation of the following: a picture data model, a query speciflcation language for expressing user queries, and matching or retrieval strategies required for retrieving relevant images from a picture database to provide answers to user queries. <p> The data model employed for unformatted view of data is primarily one of the two fundamental physical level representations: raster or vector. Representations such as topological vector representation, Geographic Base File=Dual Independent Map Encoding (GBF/DIME), and POLYgon conVERTer (POLYVERT) also have been used <ref> [136] </ref>. In systems where the formatted data is limited to the data that is derived external to the picture contents, the data model used is simply a set of keywords or attribute-value pairs that are integratedly stored as part of the flle header information. <p> There are various formats available for the former case such as GIF and TIFF [56]. For the latter case, most of the current representations are at the level of pixels <ref> [136] </ref>, which we refer to as physical representations or physical level representations. Among the physical level representations, raster and vector formats are ubiquitous [54]. There is always a trade-ofi between the level of abstraction involved in the representation of a picture and the operations and inferencing it facilitates.

Reference-contexts: Speciflcation of these attributes necessarily involves some subjectivity, imprecision and/or uncertainty. Retrieval by Semantic Attribute queries are formulated by using the semantic attributes. AIR framework has raised several interesting research issues and solutions to some of them are provided in <ref> [71, 141, 70, 73] </ref>. VIMSYS (Visual Information Management SYStem) is an objectoriented multilayer data model proposed exclusively for visual information (i.e., pictures, video, etc.) management [77]. VIMSYS data model has four layers. The flrst (i.e., the bottom) layer is used to model multiple physical representations for images. <p> This approach implies that the retrieval users are domain experts and may render the system domainspeciflc. To account for the difiering domain interpretations and the view points of the retrieval users, database researchers have advocated that these difierences in the interpretations be considered during the database design phase <ref> [141, 72, 70] </ref>. Additionally, incremental query speciflcation and reflnement through interactive involvement of the user to resolve any ambiguities and/or imprecision in the query speciflcation itself [82, 99, 73] or during query processing in the form of providing relevance feedback on the initial retrieval results is suggested [73, 4, 96]. <p> Hence, an automated or semi-automated tool for discovering the set of attributes that are best suited for meeting the retrieval needs of a pictorial database application is essential. A tool for this task based on Personal 32 Construct Theory from the Clinical Psychology domain has been investigated in <ref> [141, 73, 70] </ref>. 4.12 System Architecture We envision a general purpose Picture Retrieval System to feature all of the functionality described above. Such a system will provide uniform access to large, heterogeneous, distributed picture collections.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, similarity measures for attributes based on the Euclidean distance are clearly unsuitable for all the data types. Similarity measures must consider aspects of an attribute such as the scale of measurement (i.e., nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio) <ref> [143] </ref> used and possibly the difiering view points and interpretations of the domain users [96, 73]. 4.6 Spatial Similarity In application areas such as Real Estate Marketing and Satellite Imagery Matching , a major class of users' requests require retrieving those images in the database that are spatially similar to the

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the idea of representing pictures by index terms or attribute--value pairs helps to achieve domain independence and is similar to the representation of documents by index terms in Bibliographic Information Systems <ref> [145] </ref>. In the latter, documents are uniformly represented by index terms in a domain independent fashion. However, it should be noted that the indexing task itself is domain dependent and complex and is usually performed in a semi-automated fashion in commercially successful Bibliographic Information Systems.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, a completely manual approach to object recognition and feature extraction is uneconomical and tedious. Therefore, semi-automated approaches to object recognition and feature extraction seem to be very promising. There has been some recent research in this direction referred to as interactive outlining <ref> [44, 146] </ref>. During the insertion of a new image into the database, the system outlines and 27 extracts features of the domain objects with the assistance of a human.

Reference-contexts: Once the pictorial semantic network (s) is constructed for a domain, it can be searched to retrieve relevant images. Another schema for conceptual indexing of images is discussed in [79]. FINDIT is an image retrieval tool for locating images that contain an object specifled in the query <ref> [156] </ref>. Objects are specifled by closed spine curves and matching algorithms are based on histogram matching and correlation on wavelet-encoded images. An approach to retrieving similar images from NOVA satellite imagery collection is discussed in [104]. <p> Therefore, there is a considerable scope for posing ad hoc queries on the picture database and to facilitate content based picture retrieval. However, it is well recognized that an automated approach to object recognition is a very di-cult problem <ref> [53, 111, 156, 59] </ref>. Furthermore, the problem is worsened if we assume that the objects to be recognized originate from disparate domains.
