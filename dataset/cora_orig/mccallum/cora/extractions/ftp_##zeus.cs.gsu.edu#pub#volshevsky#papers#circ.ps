Title: CIRCULANTS, DISPLACEMENTS AND DECOMPOSITIONS OF MATRICES 1  
Author: I.Gohberg and V.Olshevsky 
Abstract: In this paper are suggested new formulas for representation of matrices and their inverses in the form of sums of products of factor circulants, which are based on the analysis of the factor cyclic displacement of matrices. The results in applications to Toeplitz matrices generalized the Gohberg-Semencul, Ben-Artzi-Shalom and Heinig-Rost formulas and are useful for complexity analysis.

Reference-contexts: Before stating their results <ref> [AG] </ref> [G], let us introduce the necessary notations. <p> The matrix Circ 1 (r) is called a circulant, and the matrix Circ 1 (r) is said to be skew-circulant. In <ref> [AG] </ref> [G] it was shown that if the equality r 1 (A) = m=1 m (f m ; g T holds, then A = Circ lr + ff X L (f m ) Circ 1 (g m ) T ; (0.3) where Circ lr is the circulant with the same last <p> The last columns of the matrices X and Circ lc are the same. The formulas (1.3), (1.4) and (1.5) are generalizations of the formulas of G.Ammar and P.Gader <ref> [AG] </ref> [G]. In the latter papers the formulas (1.3) and (1.4) were obtained for the extremal case '= 1, = 0. In this case Circ (f m ) are replaced by lower triangular Toeplitz matrices. The expression similar to (1.5) was obtained in [AG] [G] for the extremal case '= 1, <p> of the formulas of G.Ammar and P.Gader <ref> [AG] </ref> [G]. In the latter papers the formulas (1.3) and (1.4) were obtained for the extremal case '= 1, = 0. In this case Circ (f m ) are replaced by lower triangular Toeplitz matrices. The expression similar to (1.5) was obtained in [AG] [G] for the extremal case '= 1, = 1, and there Circ 1 (g m ) T are replaced by upper triangular Toeplitz matrices. PROOF. Let matrix A = (a ij ) n1 i;j=0 satisfies the condition A = Z ' AZ T 1 ' . <p> Formula (3.11) is a generalization of the formula of G.Ammar and P.Gader <ref> [AG] </ref>, where they considered the case ' = 1; = 1 and Hermitian Toeplitz matrix A. Note, if the matrix A is Hermitian, then the persymmetry of A 1 means that the solutions x and y of (3.10) are related by y = J x. <p> As was already noted, for the case '= 1 both formulas (4.3) and (4.4) are due to G.Ammar and P.Gader <ref> [AG] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In a general situation the inverse of an arbitrary Toeplitz matrix cannot be determined by any fixed pair of its columns. As was shown in <ref> [BAS] </ref> for this purpose three properly chosen columns of A 1 are always enough. Now let us formulate the factor circulant analog of this result. Hereafter we shall assume that the coordinate vectors are indexed by the integers modulo n, such that e n = e 0 .

INTRODUCTION About a decade ago T.Kailath and his coauthors [KKM] <ref> [FMKL] </ref> (see also [K]) proposed a concept of classification of matrices, which turned out to be an effective tool for the investigation of the complexity of matrix inversion. We start with a brief review of their results. <p> Various applications give rise to matrices that, while not Toeplitz themselves, are closely related to Toeplitz matrices. For example, the inverses of the Toeplitz matrices, or product of two Toeplitz matrices are "close" to the Toeplitz matrices in the sense that their displacement rank is comparatively small <ref> [FMKL] </ref>. The displacement rank may be considered as a measure of the above mentioned closeness. The "displacement" approach gave a new explanation of the nature of the Gohberg Semencul formula.
