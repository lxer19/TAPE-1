Abstract: It is now evident that sustainability of an organisation is affected by its capability for the utilisation and development of new technologies. This potential, as the engine of strategic development of organisations, is based on the quality and quantity of the transfer of technology into organisations in both developed and developing countries. The fact that organisations in the first world are capable to create and provide new technologies, which is far from the passive transfer of technology, should be consider as an additional opportunity for viable strategic development in these organisations. In fact, international transfer of technology is a crucial basis for technology innovation in the industrialised world and for technological change in developing countries. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a conceptual model in which strategic technologies can be comprehensively evaluated in the context of strategic development. This requires the integration of qualitative and quantitative variables within a subjective assessment approach. Therefore, it is necessary decomposing the concepts of the technology system and technology transfer in the context of strategic and dynamic development. Based on this understanding we introduce a procedure for obtaining a reliable index which enables us to evaluate and rank candidate options. We define this index, Technology Index, to be the outcome of the proposed model for technology evaluation and strategic choice.

Reference-contexts: An important point for a solid assessment / selection of strategic technology is domain and types of uncertainty, and the ways to cope with in the process of technology assessment. Therefore, it is required to balance many different forms of risk <ref> (Clemons 1991) </ref> such as the following: 1. Financial risk: the costs may outweigh the expected benefits or the organisation may not be able to afford it; 2. Technical risk: the technology may not be able to support what is required by the project; 3.

Reference-contexts: For a project starting-up in Brazil the transferor had problems for transplanting their administrative structure from a large (original) plant at home, to a smaller one in a setting with fewer experienced technical personnel and less-skilled workers <ref> (Dahlman et al. 1987) </ref>. This is apart from other problems that left some of the transfer projects with less or lack of successful outcomes.

Reference-contexts: This may be due to the environment having changed; 5. Systemic risk: here the success of the system may drastically change the environment so that previous estimates of costs and benefits are significantly altered. Furthermore, there is a very important type of uncertainty that is caused by human-technology mismatch <ref> (for further discussion, see Kahen & Griffiths 1995) </ref>. In fact, human-based uncertainty (i.e. uncertainty caused by human conflicts) should be seen as an internal variable which has not been given adequate value within the process of evaluation.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that information is not culturally neutral and current information is a reflection of a certain way of thinking and of a certain economic and social organisation: it is the product of a given rationalist and special culture <ref> (Kalman 1981) </ref>. Such a structure is deeply affected by cultural environment in which symbols and meanings within the model will be differently interpreted in another cultural context where technology users are in different sociocultural, environmental, technical, and economic contexts.

Reference-contexts: of modern technology, for instance, the analysis of the performance of computerisation in a big manufacturing company in Egypt (NASCO) revealed that the Western conception of rational behaviour used as basis for the design of the computer systems studied is often inconsistent with the observed conditions and behaviour at NASCO <ref> (Lind 1991) </ref>. In fact, behind technological models there is special rationality (mostly Westernised). Understanding and interpretation of reality and rationality within models is a complex issue which should be taken into account for an effective transfer of a strategic technology in organisations. <p> - health problems, unsuitable temperature and ventilation conditions. 2 This may be partly because the work requires more attention, and it is probably also a question of the psychological effects of the mechanical equipment. 10 These problems can be categorised into three major sets: operational, contextual, and strategical Another study <ref> (Lind 1991) </ref> revealed that a such operational problems occurred when the Indian government chose the British BBC computers for its computer-in-school project. The selected equipment never worked properly as it was not designed to operate in the high temperature and humidity prevailing in many Indian regions.

Reference-contexts: There are two major reasons for this: inappropriate choice of applications, and inadequate consideration of organisational and environmental factors in the formulation and implementation of technological strategy <ref> (Mohan & Belardo 1990) </ref>. This can cause a form of unsuitable resource allocation (see, for example, Jones 1985; Todaro 1985; Hill 1986).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, even if similar systems are in use elsewhere, transporting them, modifying them, and fitting them to match local needs, may not be easy. In fact, in many cases, local specifications may be a preferred solution <ref> (Narasimhan 1984) </ref>. It should be mentioned that the three categories are interrelated; a problem in one group cannot be addressed without considering the other types of problems.

Reference-contexts: In fact, two features of the AHP differentiate it from other decision-making approaches: ability to handle both tangible and intangible attributes; and ability to monitor the consistency with which a decision-maker (i.e. technology assessor) makes his judgments <ref> (Roper & Sharp 1990) </ref>. Allowing the integration of both, quantitative and qualitative criteria in the proposed model, the AHP should be approached within three major components: Problem Structuring (the formation of levels in a rational hierarchy), Preference Assessment (prioritisation), and 14 Synthesis.
