Abstract: Electroencephalogram, or EEG, signals are an important source of information for the study of underlying brain processes. Such studies now provide a framework for the development of a new modality of human-computer interaction based on EEG. Current research in this area only detects a small number of mental states. In this article, EEG from one subject who performed three mental tasks are classified by neural networks. Using a sixth-order autoregressive (AR) model of half-second windows of six-channel EEG, a classification accuracy of 89% on test data is achieved. A cross-validation study of a variety of neural network topologies showed that a network with one hidden layer of 20 units produced the best performance. It was also found that averaging the output of the network over consecutive inputs improved performance. K-means clustering of the resulting neural networks' weights identified key components of the AR representation.

Reference-contexts: contain more than 35 windows, averaging the outputs over that many windows resulted in lower performance. | Insert figure 10 about here. | 5 ANALYSIS OF THE NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIER To understand what was learned by a neural network, symbolic rules can be extracted that capture some of the information <ref> (e.g., Alexander and Mozer, 1995) </ref>. However, we find it is more useful to numerically analyze our neural network classifiers for our EEG classification problem. We used graphical and numerical tools to interpret what was learned by the 20-0 network.

These six channels were referenced to electrically linked mastoids at A1 and A2. The impedance of all electrodes was kept below five Kohms.

Reference-contexts: Model orders from two to six were tested, with little difference between them. Adding the peak frequency did not improve the results. The performance of several classifiers was compared, including LVQ3 <ref> (Kohonen, 1995) </ref>, k-means, and backpropagation neural networks. Their best results|90% correct|were obtained using LVQ3 with one or two reference vectors. The neural network trained with backpropagation was not significantly worse, though required more computational effort to train. <p> After normalizing, signals were bandpass filtered to 9-11 Hz and their power was calculated by squaring the result. Power values were averaged over successive samples for 125, 250, or 500 milliseconds and results compared. Classification was performed with Kohonen's LVQ3 algorithm <ref> (Kohonen, 1995) </ref>. The best classification results on test data were 80% correct. Results were not significantly affected by varying the window size or by the use of the normalization methods.

Reference-contexts: The subject, selected arbitrarily from Keirn and Aunon's data, was a 48-year-old, left-handed, male, university employee. All tasks were performed with the subject's eyes open. The tasks were chosen by Keirn and Aunon to invoke hemispheric brainwave asymmetry <ref> (Osaka, 1984) </ref>. The three tasks were: 5 Baseline Task: The subject was not asked to perform a specific mental task, but to relax as much as possible and think of nothing in particular.

Reference-contexts: The procedure described here could be modified to do this by using an output layer of the neural network that generates a multinomial distribution. Then, with a small change to the error backpropagation procedure, the network could be trained to approximate the a posterior task probabilities <ref> (Rumelhart et al., 1995) </ref>. This is currently being investigated. The most likely avenue to better discrimination accuracy is to continue the search for a better representation of the EEG signals. Here, we used linear predictive models to reduce the dimensionality of the signals.
