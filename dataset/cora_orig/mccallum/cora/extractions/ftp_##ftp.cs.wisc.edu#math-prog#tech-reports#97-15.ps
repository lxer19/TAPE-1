Reference-contexts: Finally, we also considered the option of initiating the computation by performing at most 10 iterations of a projected gradient method to minimize F over the nonnegative orthant <ref> [1] </ref>. The rationale behind this option is to try to move in a more "promising" zone by performing a few steps of a robust and not expensive method.

Reference-contexts: (1) so that the NCP (F ) can be reformulated as a system of nonsmooth equations F (x) = 0; where F : IR n ! IR n is defined by F (x) := B @ . . . 1 C The Fischer function, or some suitable modifications of it <ref> [25, 23, 22, 2] </ref>, has maintained a central role in the development of semismooth methods up to now; in fact it appears to possess many favourable properties both from the theoretical and numerical point of view. 3 In this paper we introduce a general line search scheme based on the semismooth <p> Other examples include, e.g., ' KK (a; b) := (a b) 2 + ab a b; 2 (0; 4) fixed (see Kanzow and Kleinmichel [22]), and ' CCK (a; b) := ' F (a; b) (1 )a + b + ; 2 (0; 1) fixed (see Chen, Chen and Kanzow <ref> [2] </ref>), where a + := maxf0; ag and, similarly, b + := maxf0; bg. We denote the corresponding operators by KK and CCK , respectively. <p> The function ' KK is interesting because for = 2 it reduces to the Fischer function, and in the limiting case = 0 it becomes a multiple of the Minimum function. On the other hand, very strong theoretical and numerical results have been reported for ' CCK in <ref> [2] </ref>. Now, similar to the (exact, inexact and LM inexact) Fischer-Qi directions, we can define (exact, inexact and LM inexact) search directions based on KK and CCK . <p> On the other hand, very strong theoretical and numerical results have been reported for ' CCK in [2].

Since it is known <ref> [22, 2] </ref> that KK and CCK are (strongly) semismooth if F is a C 1 -function (LC 1 -function) and that an R-regular solution of NCP (F ) is a BD-regular solution for the nonlinear systems of equations KK (x) = 0 and CCK (x) = 0, it is not difficult

Reference-contexts: Then x fl is an R-regular solution if and only if it is a b-regular solution. Proof. The statement follows directly from Theorem 2.5 and the fact that the Schur- complement of a nonsingular submatrix of a P 0 -matrix is again a P 0 -matrix, see <ref> [3, Lemma 2.3] </ref>. 2 If F : IR n ! IR n is a P 0 -function, then all Jacobian matrices are P 0 -matrices by [28, The- orem 5.8]. Hence there is no difference between Rand b-regular solutions for P 0 -function complementarity problems.

Reference-contexts: Proposition 2.9 Suppose that F is a C 1 -function. Then the merit function F is continuously differentiable with gradient r F (x) = H T F (x) for an arbitrary matrix H 2 @ F (x). In <ref> [6] </ref> it has been shown how to calculate elements in the B-subdifferential of F , and this, in view of Proposition 2.9, also allows to easily evaluate the gradient of F . We now consider analogous issues for P . <p> the natural merit function associated to the operator P is not differentiable everywhere in general, making the design of globally convergent algorithms based on P fairly cumbersome. 11 3 Algorithm and Convergence In this section we propose a general algorithmic scheme which is similar to the algorithms considered, e.g., in <ref> [19, 6] </ref>. The only difference is that, instead of using a specific direction, we use a generic direction on which we impose certain assumptions. In the next section, we shall illustrate how directions satisfying these assumptions can be calculated. <p> But then (13) and (10) imply that fp k g ! 0 so that r F (x fl ) = 0 by Assumption 1 (b). 2 Assumptions under which a stationary point of the function F is a solution of the complementarity problem are given in <ref> [6] </ref> to which we refer the interested reader. Here we only note that if F is a P 0 -function then every stationary point of F is a solution of the complementarity problem. <p> Obviously, it does not appear to be very desirable to have to resort to the gradient often. From this point of view we may note that it is easy to see that the Fischer-Qi directions are always directions of descent for the merit function F , see, e.g., <ref> [11, 6] </ref>, while we cannot expect a similar property to hold for the Pang-Qi directions since these directions are calculated on the basis of a reformulation of the complementarity problem based on P and not on F . <p> In particular, if we use the exact Fischer-Qi direction we have the algorithm considered in <ref> [6] </ref>, whereas if we use the inexact LM Fischer-Qi direction we obtain the algorithm considered in [10]. 5 Numerical Results 5.1 Description of the Test Problems and Implementation Details We tested our algorithm on test problems generated by using a technique first suggested in [17] and subsequently used, e.g., in [10].

Reference-contexts: We also set a limit of 200 iterations to the conjugate gradient phase. Finally we turn to the choice of k . We first note that the classical sophisticated choices indicated, e.g., in <ref> [7] </ref>, are not suitable for large-scale problems. We therefore used a very simple, and yet seemingly effective strategy, already employed in [10].

Reference-contexts: The rationale behind this option is to try to move in a more "promising" zone by performing a few steps of a robust and not expensive method. Similar ideas were successfully used, for example, in <ref> [8] </ref>, where, however, the situation is slightly more complicated since the merit function is not differentiable. It should be remarked that in this gradient phase, we introduce the constraints x 0.

Reference-contexts: Instead, an iterative method is used to solve the linear system (4), and this method is stopped when the norm of the residual r k is smaller than a prefixed accuracy.

Reference-contexts: The vector r k is, again, the residual. The local properties of the Generalized Inexact Levenberg-Marquardt Method are also very similar to its smooth counterpart, and have been established in <ref> [10] </ref>. Theorem 2.3 Let G : IR n ! IR n be semismooth and let x fl 2 IR n be a BD-regular solution of G (x) = 0: Suppose that fx k g is a sequence generated by the Generalized Inexact Levenberg- Marquardt Method. <p> It was already considered in <ref> [10] </ref> and is defined as follows: (H T k F (x k ) + r k ; (18) where k is a nonnegative number and r k is the residual, which measures the inaccuracy with which the system is solved. <p> In particular, if we use the exact Fischer-Qi direction we have the algorithm considered in [6], whereas if we use the inexact LM Fischer-Qi direction we obtain the algorithm considered in <ref> [10] </ref>. 5 Numerical Results 5.1 Description of the Test Problems and Implementation Details We tested our algorithm on test problems generated by using a technique first suggested in [17] and subsequently used, e.g., in [10]. <p> [6], whereas if we use the inexact LM Fischer-Qi direction we obtain the algorithm considered in <ref> [10] </ref>. 5 Numerical Results 5.1 Description of the Test Problems and Implementation Details We tested our algorithm on test problems generated by using a technique first suggested in [17] and subsequently used, e.g., in [10].

We first note that the classical sophisticated choices indicated, e.g., in [7], are not suitable for large-scale problems.

Reference-contexts: Another point which deserves attention is the structure of the B-subdifferentials of F and P and the conditions which guarantee BD-regularity at a solution. The following result was shown in <ref> [11] </ref>. Proposition 2.8 Suppose that F is a C 1 -function and x fl is an R-regular solution of NCP (F ). <p> Then x fl is a BD-regular solution of the system F (x) = 0: A crucial property in the design of globally convergent algorithms, that has been extensively exploited in recent years, is that the corresponding merit function F (see (2)) is continuously differentiable <ref> [11, 16, 19] </ref>). Proposition 2.9 Suppose that F is a C 1 -function. Then the merit function F is continuously differentiable with gradient r F (x) = H T F (x) for an arbitrary matrix H 2 @ F (x). <p> Then, eventually p k = d k , x k+1 = x k + d k and fx k g converges Q-superlinearly to x fl . The proof uses the following two lemmas. The first one was shown in <ref> [11] </ref> under a slightly stronger assumption. However, it is easy to see that the proof goes through with the weaker assumption stated here. The second lemma readily follows from [34, Lemma 3.1]. <p> semismooth by Proposition 2.7 (b), and the assertion follows from Theorem 2.1 (c). (c) This follows immediately from [15, Theorem 4], Proposition 2.10 and the upper semi- continuity of the B-subdifferential. 2 Point (c) in the theorem above also appears to be strongly related to the finite termination result in <ref> [11] </ref>. From a computational point of view, it may be interesting to observe that the system H k d = P (x k ), used in (19), is very structured, and this can be exploited numerically. <p> Obviously, it does not appear to be very desirable to have to resort to the gradient often. From this point of view we may note that it is easy to see that the Fischer-Qi directions are always directions of descent for the merit function F , see, e.g., <ref> [11, 6] </ref>, while we cannot expect a similar property to hold for the Pang-Qi directions since these directions are calculated on the basis of a reformulation of the complementarity problem based on P and not on F .

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, it turns out that these new semismooth algorithms have stronger theoretical properties than the known ones and that their numerical behaviour is at least comparable. The nonlinear complementarity problem has important applications in operations research, economic equilibrium models and in the engineering sciences, see, e.g., <ref> [18, 12] </ref>. For this reason, there is a growing interest in finding efficient and robust algorithms for solving NCP (F ). This reflects in an increasing number of proposals of solution schemes for NCP (F ) in recent years.

Reference-contexts: We refer the reader to Subsection 2.1 for a short overview on semismooth Newton methods and to Subsection 2.3 for the presentation of some basic properties of two different reformulations which will be considered in this paper. The first semismooth methods were based on the Fischer function <ref> [13] </ref>: ' F (a; b) := a 2 + b 2 a b: The function ' F has the property that ' F (a; b) = 0 () a 0; b 0; ab = 0; (1) so that the NCP (F ) can be reformulated as a system of nonsmooth equations

Reference-contexts: In view of the results of the previous sections we are obviously interested in the semis- moothness properties of these reformulations. The first result that can easily be established is that, if F is (strongly) semismooth, then also F and P are strongly semismooth, see <ref> [14, 20] </ref> for details. In particular, we have the following Proposition 2.7 (a) If F is a C 1 -function, then F and P are semismooth. (b) If F is an LC 1 -function, then F and P are strongly semismooth.

Reference-contexts: Hence Assumption 2 sup holds because of Theorem 2.1 (a) and (b). If, in addition, F is an LC 1 - function, then P is strongly semismooth by Proposition 2.7 (b), and the assertion follows from Theorem 2.1 (c). (c) This follows immediately from <ref> [15, Theorem 4] </ref>, Proposition 2.10 and the upper semi- continuity of the B-subdifferential. 2 Point (c) in the theorem above also appears to be strongly related to the finite termination result in [11].

Reference-contexts: Instead, an iterative method is used to solve the linear system (4), and this method is stopped when the norm of the residual r k is smaller than a prefixed accuracy. The following result can be established, see <ref> [26, 9] </ref>. 6 Theorem 2.2 Let G be semismooth and let x fl be a BD-regular solution of the system G (x) = 0: Suppose that fx k g is a sequence generated by the Generalized Inexact Newton Method.

Reference-contexts: 2.5 and the fact that the Schur- complement of a nonsingular submatrix of a P 0 -matrix is again a P 0 -matrix, see [3, Lemma 2.3]. 2 If F : IR n ! IR n is a P 0 -function, then all Jacobian matrices are P 0 -matrices by <ref> [28, The- orem 5.8] </ref>. Hence there is no difference between Rand b-regular solutions for P 0 -function complementarity problems.
