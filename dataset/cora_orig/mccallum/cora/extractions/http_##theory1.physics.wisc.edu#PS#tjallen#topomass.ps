Abstract: The four-dimensional theory of a 1-form abelian gauge field A coupled to a 2-form (antisymmetric tensor) potential B is studied. The two gauge invariances of the theory admit a coupling mB ^F where F is the field strength (F = dA) of A. It is shown that this theory is a unitary, renormalizable theory of a massive spin-one field with no additional degrees of freedom. In this sense it is a generalization to four dimensions of topological mechanisms in two dimensions (the Schwinger model) and three dimensions (Chern-Simons theory). The issue of spontaneous symmetry breaking is also examined.

Reference-contexts: In three dimensions the addition of a Chern-Simons term to the Lagrangian also results in a massive spin-1 vector field, with the mass arbitrary in the abelian case and quantized in the non-abelian case. The mass generation in these models may be viewed as resulting from non-trivial underlying topology <ref> [1] </ref>. In four dimensions a fundamentally different mechanism the Higgs mechanism is usually invoked to generate a mass gap whilst preserving the gauge invariance needed to ensure renormalizability of the theory.

Reference-contexts: There is also known a topological-type gauge-invariant mechanism for generating mass for an abelian gauge field in four dimensions. It involves introducing a 2-form potential (Kalb-Ramond field) B <ref> [2] </ref> into the theory and coupling it to the gauge field through a B ^ F term. This theory has two types of gauge invariance and has therefore highly constrained couplings and is very geometrical.

Reference-contexts: Finally in section 5 we look at the issue of symmetry breaking in the B ^ F theory. 2. A Topological Lagrangian in Four Dimensions A well-known example of topological mass generation is the 2+1 dimensional Chern-Simons theory <ref> [3] </ref>. In this theory the relevant terms in the Lagrangian are L cs = 1 A ^ F A ^ fl j; (2:1) where A is the gauge field, F = dA and j = e fl .

Reference-contexts: It seems possible that this mechanism can be generalized to non-abelian gauge fields in 3+1 dimensions using the non-abelian generalization of the Kalb-Ramond gauge invariance due to Rajeev <ref> [4] </ref>. Such a mechanism would obviate the need for a Higgs boson, left over from the process of giving mass to the gauge fields (via the usual Higgs mechanism) but would not address the independent problems of giving masses to the quarks and leptons and of chiral symmetry breaking.

Reference-contexts: We should note here that the massiveness is not a gauge artifact, because F obeys the massive Klein-Gordon equation <ref> [5] </ref> independent of gauge choice, as can be seen by substituting the second equation of (2.9) into the first. Another point of interest is that the field is not a Higgs.

Reference-contexts: axion. y In particular, it is more natural to view this as a theory with a massive gauge field in flat space in the presence of fermionic matter, while near a black hole with large closed strings present, this may be treated as a theory of a massive Kalb-Ramond field <ref> [6] </ref>. y The terminology is a little confusing here. A massive B has three degrees of freedom, while conventionally an axion is a scalar field that couples derivatively to other fields. 4 3. <p> Q above was just the generator of gauge transformations B ! B + where = d (H 2 ( 3 M) = 0 iff d = 0 ) = d). When the space-time is nontrivial more interesting things can happen. In nontrivial space-times, (such as axionic black hole spacetimes <ref> [6] </ref> or when 3 M = R 3 nf0g) the axionic charge is, strictly speaking, not 3 M H = @ 3 M B, since the boundary includes a 2-sphere around r = 0.

Reference-contexts: The counterterms induced by these three diagrams cancel all higher order divergences, and the theory is renormalizable. The gauge dependence of the counterterms can be seen by using arguments similar to the ones used for massive quantum electrodynamics <ref> [7] </ref>.
