Abstract: Coevolution has been proposed as a way to evolve a learner and a learning environment simultaneously such that open-ended progress arises naturally, via a competitive arms race, with minimal inductive bias. Nevertheless, the conditions necessary to initiate and sustain arms-race dynamics are not well understood; mediocre stable states frequently result from learning through self-play (Angeline & Pollack 1994), while analysis usually requires closed domains with known optima, like sorting-networks (Hillis 1991). While intuitions regarding what enables successful coevolution abound, none have been methodically tested. We present a game that affords such methodical investigation. A population of deterministic string generators is coevolved with two populations of string predictors, one "friendly" and one "hostile"; generators are rewarded to behave in a manner that is simultaneously predictable to the friendly predictors and unpredictable to the hostile predictors. This game design allows us to employ information theory to provide rigorous characterizations of agent behavior and coevolutionary progress. Further, we can craft agents of known ability and environments of known difficulty, and thus precisely frame questions regarding learnability. Our results show that subtle changes to the game determine whether it is open-ended, and profoundly affect the existence and nature of an arms race.

Reference-contexts: We find that open-ended coevolution is not necessarily synonymous with a purely competitive framework; our game requires a mixture of cooperative and competitive pressures to avoid simple mediocre stable-states and closed-endedness. In this sense, our result agrees substantially with <ref> (Akiyama & Kaneko 1997) </ref>. Finally, because our domain allows us to characterize the difficulty of an environment, we can identify arms races that have broken because a participant has become too good. Indeed, we can begin to tease apart the many possible causes of system disfunction.

Reference-contexts: Rather than enter an arms race, the two populations form loose food-chain relationships and fall into a circular pattern of convention chasing | a mediocre stable-state. Much like the CIAO graphs of <ref> (Cliff & Miller 1995) </ref>, predictors against the champion generators that were evolved by scoring method A. Each position on the axes represents a moment in evolutionary time when a change in champion occurred.

Reference-contexts: Rather than give their formal mathematical definitions, we emphasize a more intuitive explanation of these concepts and their implications as they relate to our domain. Readers interested in more formal detail are referred to <ref> (Hamming 1980) </ref>. Entropy Information theory is concerned with characterizing signals and their transmission. A signal source produces some symbol, which is passed through a channel to a receiver. We assume, for our purposes, that the channel does not distort the signal.

Reference-contexts: This view of system complexity thus considers random sources to be simpler than completely predictable sources of higher order; the size and structure of the Markov model is what counts, not the compressibility of the produced signal <ref> (Kolen & Pollack 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: That low-order, regular generators out-score irregular ones by method A indicates that simple prediction strategies can be elicited from the initial predictor population | prediction strategies against which the most adaptive generators act as potent anti-signals, sequences that make predictors perform worse than random <ref> (Zhu & Kinzel 1997) </ref>. Since the generators are ballistic, they require some homogeneity amongst the predictors in order to be viable as anti-signals.
