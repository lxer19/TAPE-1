Reference-contexts: Finally, when an organism happens to step on a food cell, it eats the food element which disappears. To evolve organisms which are able to reach food elements we used a kind of genetic algorithm <ref> (Holland, 1975) </ref> applied to the organisms' "genotypes". We begin with 100 randomly generated genotypes each yielding a network with a different architecture and a different assignment of connection weights. This is Generation 0 (G0).

Reference-contexts: But these methods, in addition to being biologically implausible, have problems in scalability, i.e. performance degrades significantly as the size of the network increases <ref> (Kitano, 1990) </ref>. In real life the mapping from genetic information into network structure is a very complex one. Langton (1992) has stressed that we cannot predict which phenotype will emerge from a given genotype because of the large nonlinearities present in the mapping process.

Reference-contexts: Simulations with the same type of task and environment in which a fixed architecture was used required many more connections and resulted in poorer performance <ref> (Nolfi and Parisi, 1991) </ref>. Other interesting results concern the observed regularities in the evolutionary development of the organisms' sensory and motor systems. (Notice that, within the sensory layer, filled circles represent neurons sensitive to the angle of the nearest food element and empty circles neurons sensitive to its distance.
