Reference-contexts: People (both the search engine providers and the users) evaluate and compare the performances of the search engines using different criteria <ref> [5] </ref> [13] [23]. Actually, all the search engine providers have their own arguments to declare to be the best, like Excite, Lycos, etc. Users also don't have the unanimous answers to the questions of how to evaluate different engines and what performance measures are more important.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the updating period of this kind of database is long, and will not meet of the growing speed of the ever exploding WWW. Recently, artificial intelligence, natural language processing are being used to build directory database by computer <ref> [9] </ref>. They replace part of the work originally done manually and the processing speed is much faster. However, so far, the performance of these mechanisms is not quite satisfactory yet.

Reference-contexts: While the robots can recursively augment its URL collection and automatically update its database, there is no easy way to determine which of a set of URLs has been removed, moved, or modified. There is a "If-Modified-Since" mechanism in the HTTP <ref> [10] </ref> which allows the user-agent to specify the modification time-stamp of a cached document along with a request for the document. The contents of the document will be transfered only if the document has been modified since it was cached. <p> The same web page can have infinite number of URLs starting with "http://degas.eecs.berkeley.edu/~thuang/index.html", and continuing with "http://degas.eecs.berkeley.edu/~thuang/self/index.h-tml", "http://degas.eecs.berkeley.edu/~thuang/self/self/index.html", etc. A more elaborated version of this kind of infinite loop can trap robots that fall into them, then it is called "black holes" <ref> [10] </ref>. A simple way to keep a robot away from a "black hole" is to impose a limit on the depth a robot can search, but that may compromise the size and coverage of the collection. <p> Robots operate continually and some even feature parallel retrieval for faster collection. Temporary shortage of bandwidth for general users may be resulted from a large number of robotic retrievals in a short time ("rapid fire") <ref> [10] </ref>. The extra load placed on a server probed by a robot may compromise the performance of the server during the probe.

Reference-contexts: This gives the web designer's a little bit of control over what is done by the search engines with their pages. When this kind of feature is not available, however, web designers might tend to try to "fool" the search engine. An example of this is a suggestion <ref> [14] </ref> to repeat commented paragraphs to improve the ranking in Excite which uses AI techniques to search through the database, and does not support meta-tags. The same can be said by a commonly used way to increase relevancy: keywords loading or spamming. <p> Since this is a well known way to fool search engines, many search engines are already immune to this trick, and may even punish those that do it by putting them at the end of the list <ref> [14] </ref>. A big problem observed in many search engines in particular, Hotbot and Altavista (from our sample query in section 1.3) is the repetition of entries in the same server. Search engines should prevent that by presenting a more diverse listing especially in the first down-load.

Reference-contexts: Accessible through WWW are many type of resources like HTTP, Gopher, Veronica, Archie, WAIS, USENET, etc <ref> [15] </ref>. A collector that 12 searches through all of them may not have the collection in one type of resource as complete as that of a collector specializing in that one type for the same cost.
