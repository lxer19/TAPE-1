Abstract: In this paper we describe ASTRA, a computational aid for generating process explanations in nuclear astrophysics. The system operates in two stages, the first using knowledge of quantum theory to produce a set of legal reactions among elements and the second searching for pathways of such reactions that explain the evolution of some element in terms of lighter ones. ASTRA has found apparently novel reactions that involve proton and neutron capture, as well as novel fusion reactions that produce neutrons and deuterium. The system has also generated reaction pathways for helium, carbon, and oxygen that do not appear in the scientific literature. Discussions with an expert in the domain suggest these results have scientific merit. However, ASTRA also finds many other reaction pathways that are less interesting and that point toward directions for future research.

Reference-contexts: The basic problem is to explain the transformation of hydrogen (H), hypothesized to have emerged before the formation of stars and galaxies, into helium ( 4 He) and other elements <ref> (Fowler, 1986) </ref>. Another challenge concerns the distribution of the elements, in particular the abundance of carbon ( 12 C), nitrogen ( 14 N), and oxygen ( 16 O) relative to lighter elements like lithium ( 7 Li), beryllium (9Be), and boron ( 11 B).

Reference-contexts: Related Research on Scientific Discovery Our approach to computational discovery draws many ideas from earlier work on the topic. As we noted in Section 2, our system shares many goals and techniques with Valdes-Perez' Mechem, which discovers reaction pathways in physical chemistry. Another close relative is SynGen <ref> (Hendrickson, 1995) </ref>, which addresses the task of chemical synthesis in which one must determine not only the reaction paths but also the starting molecules. A more detailed similarity is that both ASTRA and SynGen generate pathways by chaining backward from the final products using known reactions.

Reference-contexts: Early research focused on replicating discoveries from the history of science, covering results from disciplines as diverse as physics, chemistry, and biology. The types of discoveries also ranged widely, including numeric laws (e.g., Langley, 1981), qualitative relations <ref> (e.g., Jones, 1986) </ref>, structural models (e.g., Zytkow & Simon, 1986), and process models (e.g., Kulkarni & Simon, 1990). Nevertheless, some critics questioned these results because they involved scientific relations already known to the developers.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm simply instantiates each form in all possible ways and retains each proposed reaction only if it conserves all the relevant properties. The basic operation at this stage is equivalent to one module of the BR-4 system, which we have described elsewhere <ref> (Kocabas & Langley, 1995) </ref>. Note that this process generates not only fusion reactions, considered the mainstay of astrophysics, but also decay reactions, in which one element breaks into others. <p> Generating Explanations in Astrophysics 12 Our system differs mainly from these earlier algorithms in its focus on astrophysics and in its ability to generate the basic reactions from the elements involved and the principles of quantum physics. ASTRA inherits this latter ability from our previous BR-4 system <ref> (Kocabas & Langley, 1995) </ref>, which carries out theory revision in particle physics, much like its predecessor BR-3 (Kocabas, 1991). The BR-3 system in turn is a direct descendant of Stahl (Zytkow & Simon, 1986) and Stahlp (Rose & Langley, 1986), which modeled qualitative discovery in chemistry.

Reference-contexts: Discussion of Results We have been careful to compare ASTRA's outputs, at both the reaction and pathway level, to those available in standard texts on astrophysics (Adouze & Vauclair, 1990; Clayton, 1983; Fowler, 1986; Kippenhahn & Weigert, 1994; Lang, 1974) and particle physics <ref> (Williams, 1991) </ref>. Of course, an exhaustive comparison to these fields' literatures would be intractable, but we have combined our search with analyses by an established scientist in the area, whose expertise should complement that available in our sample of the written record.
