Abstract: In News-on-Demand, we can navigate the complex information space of news stories, without the linear access constraint that normally makes this process so time consuming. Thus Informedia News-on-Demand provides a new dimension in information access to video and audio material. In the future, we plan to add OCR capabilities for reading headlines and image processing for visual scene segmentation to the News-on-Demand system. The greatest societal impact of what we do will most likely be in K-12 education. The Digital Video Library represents a critical step toward an educational future that we can hardly recognize today. Ready access to multimedia resources will bring to the paradigm of books, blackboards, and classrooms the energy, vitality, and intimacy of entertainment television and video games. The persistent and pervasive impact of such capabilities will revolutionize education as weve known it, making it as engaging and powerful as the television students have come to love. I would like to thank Michael Witbrock for his help with News-on-demand and everything else, Mike Christel for the Informedia library interface, Ravi Mosur for the fbs6/fbs8 Sphinx-II implementation. I am also indebted to all the members of the Informedia Project under Howard Wactlar for helping to digitize and record the data as well as the CMU Speech Group under Raj Reddy for all their support.
