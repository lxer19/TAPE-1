Abstract: This paper presents an overview of a planned system for automatic population of geospatial databases which represent urban exteriors as textured geometric model data. The salient features of the system are that 1) it employs "pose- imagery:" high-quality, digital still images, each timestamped, and annotated with a reliable estimate of the acquiring camera's absolute position and attitude; 2) it exploits both dense and sparse image features by sifting evidence for in- terpixel correlation across every image; 3) it addresses the combinatorial aspects of large-scale 3D reconstruction from thousands of arbitrary images; and 4) it has no "human in the loop."

Reference-contexts: Using many thousands of close-range images, rather than a few distant images, and annotating them with high-quality pose estimates in an absolute Earth coordinate system, make the "footprint" of this effort quite distinct from those of existing efforts [ Niem, 1994 ] <ref> [ Collins et al., 1995 ] </ref> [ Streilein, 1995 ] . We hope to learn much and develop a class of useful 3D reconstruction algorithms novel from both research and engineering standpoints.

Reference-contexts: The resulting "pose-camera" will ease some of the most significant hindrances to achieving automated 3D reconstruction <ref> [ Faugeras, 1993 ] </ref> . We have developed several novel algorithms that process pose-imagery to: establish sparse (edge) and dense (region) correspondences; identify regions of empty space; and reconstruct globally consistent 3D models (with confidence bounds) from local, occluded observations. <p> Associ- ating spatially proximal cameras avoids both falsely negative and falsely positive matches that arise in schemes relying only upon temporal coherence (Fig. 2). a c <p>- sociate images (a,b) or fail to asso <p>- ciate relevant images (c,d). We augment traditional "sparse" (point- and edge-based) correspondence algorithms <ref> [ Faugeras, 1993 ] </ref> with "dense" processing algorithms which correlate every pixel in every image with some other pixel set. The goal, of course, is to find that representation of the 3D world most consistent with the totality of 2D observations (pose images).

Reference-contexts: Simulated data is synthetic imagery with arbitrary specified pose, generated with standard geometric modeling and computer graphics (rendering) algorithms. Hybrid data is imagery acquired by a manually operated camera mounted on a tripod, with pose estimates derived a posteriori via semi-automatic photogrammetry <ref> [ Horn, 1986 ] </ref> or other human assistance.
