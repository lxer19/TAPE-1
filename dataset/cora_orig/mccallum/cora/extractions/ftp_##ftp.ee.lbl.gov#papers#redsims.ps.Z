Reference-contexts: Simulations with wait set to false and linterm set to 50 should give similar results to simulations with wait set to true and linterm set to 25. 3 Acknowledgements Our old simulator tcpsim is a version of the REAL simulator [K88a] built on Columbia's Nest simulation package <ref> [BDSY88a] </ref>, with extensive modifications and bug fixes made by Steven McCanne and by Sugih Jamin. For the new simulator ns [Ns], written largely by Steve McCanne, this has been rewritten embedded into Tcl, with the simulation en gine implemented in C++. 1

For most of the simulations in this note, the parameter wait is set to true, resulting in a minimum spacing between packet drops that is a function of the drop parameter.
