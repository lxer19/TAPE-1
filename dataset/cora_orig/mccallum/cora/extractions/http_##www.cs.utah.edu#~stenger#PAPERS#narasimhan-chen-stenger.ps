Reference-contexts: Some of the sinc approximation methods include - sinc interpolation, sinc approximation of derivatives, sinc collocation, sinc quadrature, sinc indefinite convolution, sinc Galerkin method, etc. Most of the details regarding the sinc approximation mentioned above can be obtained from the SINCPACK summary by Stenger <ref> [1] </ref>. An elaborate treatment of the sinc Galerkin method can be found in the book by Lund and Bowers [2]. The harmonic sinc method is a recent addition to the powerful family of sinc approximation methods.

Reference-contexts: Many features such as singularities, infinite and semi-infinite regions or boundary layers that pose serious problems with other numerical methods can be easily handled by sinc methods. Sinc methods are now being used in various fields of engineering and science. Bisseling and Kosloff <ref> [3] </ref> developed a multidimensional interpolator based on convolution with the sinc function which was global in nature with all of the sampled data contributing to the computation. They tested the interpolator for one, two and three dimensional problems in molecular dynamics.

Reference-contexts: Their study demonstrated the salient features of the sinc method like exponential rate of convergence, ease of assembly of the discrete system, a global approximation and ability to handle singular problems. Bellomo and Ridolfi <ref> [6] </ref> developed the solution of nonlinear initial-boundary value problems by sinc collocation-interpolation methods. But the method developed by them does not include any mapping or transformation function which are normally used in all sinc literature [1,2] and hence do not give exponential convergence.

Reference-contexts: Numerical solutions of the two-dimensional heat conduction problem were obtained using a simple finite-difference method, the multigrid method by Liu <ref> [15] </ref> and the harmonic sinc approximation method. In case of the finite difference method, a central difference approximation was used for the second order space derivatives in the Laplace equation and Gauss-Seidel iteration method was used for obtaining the solution to the matrix equations. The multigrid method of Liu [15] uses <p> Liu <ref> [15] </ref> and the harmonic sinc approximation method. In case of the finite difference method, a central difference approximation was used for the second order space derivatives in the Laplace equation and Gauss-Seidel iteration method was used for obtaining the solution to the matrix equations. The multigrid method of Liu [15] uses coarse and fine meshes interchangeably to reduce the fluctuations in the value of the residual and the finest grid used in this method was 65x65 with 5 different levels of grid sizes. <p> If the problem is not formulated correctly, it can lead to erroneous results within the computational domain. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Conduction in a Square Geometry The solution obtained from the harmonic sinc approximation method was compared with the finite-difference method and the multigrid method by Liu <ref> [15] </ref>. The error between the values of obtained from the numerical methods and the analytical solution was computed as, (15) The average error within the computational domain was found to be for the finite-difference method, for the multigrid method and for the harmonic sinc method.
