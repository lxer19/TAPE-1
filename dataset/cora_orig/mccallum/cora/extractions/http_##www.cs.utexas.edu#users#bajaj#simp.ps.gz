Abstract: Many approaches to simplification of triangulated terrains and surfaces have been proposed which permit bounds on the error introduced. A few algorithms additionally bound errors in auxiliary functions defined over the triangulation. We present an approach to simplification of scalar fields over unstructured grids which preserves the topology of functions defined over the triangulation, in addition to bounding of the errors. The topology of a 2D scalar field is defined by critical points (local maxima, local minima, saddle points), in addition to integral curves between them, which together segment the field into regions which vary monotonically. By preserving this shape description, we guarantee that isocontours of the scalar function maintain the correct topology in the simplified model. Methods for topology preserving simplification by both point-insertion

Reference-contexts: approach inverts the order of operation, beginning with the scalar topology computation, which serves as a sparse base mesh which is refined to meet error-bound criteria. 3 Scalar Field Topology Scalar field structure can be characterized by the critical points of the scalar field and higher order relationships between them <ref> [4] </ref>. A point x is a critical point of the scalar function F (x) if all first-order partial derivatives of F evaluated at x are zero [30]. In degenerate cases, a critical point may be part of a larger critical curve or critical region.

Reference-contexts: Ronfard et al. [34] apply successive edge contraction operations to compute a wide range of levels-of-detail for triangulated polyhedra. Edges are extracted from a priority queue based on a computed edge cost such that edges of lesser significance are removed first. Gueziec <ref> [14] </ref> introduces a tolerance volume for bounding the error resulting from successive edge contraction operations.

Reference-contexts: Several passes over the object successively remove vertices until no vertex satisfies the criteria for removal. There is no cumulative error measure, and therefore no guarantee on the amount of accumulated error in the final representation. Hamann <ref> [15] </ref> applies a similar technique in which triangles are considered for deletion based on curvature estimates at the vertices. Reduction may be driven by mesh resolution or, in the case of functional surfaces, root-mean-square (RMS) error.

Reference-contexts: Clustering approaches have the advantage that small features which are geometrically close but not topologically connected can be grouped and merged for higher rates of simplification. In this scheme long, thin objects may collapse to an edge and small objects may collapse to a point. He et al. <ref> [16] </ref> provide more control over subsampling of regular grids by filtering the simplified mesh at each step. The regular grid corresponds to a sampling of the signed-distance function of a 3D surface. A multi-resolution triangle mesh is extracted from the resulting multi-resolution volume buffer using traditional isosurfacing techniques.

Reference-contexts: The level of mesh simplification is controlled by a parameter in the energy function which penalizes meshes with large numbers of vertices, as well as a spring constant which helps guide the energy minimization to a desirable result. In <ref> [20] </ref>, Hoppe applies the optimization framework to the simplification of scalar fields. Multi-resolution analysis Multi-resolution analysis is a structured mathematical decomposition of functions into multiple levels of representation.

The initial position for the iterative stepping is placed a small distance from the saddle point along the appropriate eigenvector. Computation of the integral curve ends when we reach the vicinity of another critical point within a certain *, in which case the curve terminates at that point.

Reference-contexts: A multi-resolution triangle mesh is extracted from the resulting multi-resolution volume buffer using traditional isosurfacing techniques. Optimization Optimization methods define measures of energies for point sets or triangulations based on an original mesh, and use interactive optimization to minimize these energies in forming a simplified mesh. Turk <ref> [40] </ref> computes simplified polygonal surfaces at a desired number of vertices. Contrast this with the point insertion and deletion methods which are usually driven by error computations rather than desired resolution. Given the desired number of vertices, point repulsion on the polygonal surface spreads the points out.
