Title: An Empirical Study of Scalable Domain Decomposition Methods for a 2-D Parabolic Equation Solver  
Author: Chi-Ming Chiang Qiang Du Matt W. Mutka Ron Sass 
Abstract: This paper describes an empirical study of an efficient scheme to solve transient problems. It describes a domain decomposition strategy that uses an explicit solution technique for adjacent boundaries. The grid points within a subdomain can be solved independently without communication required at each iteration. Therefore the amount of communication can be reduced significantly. We present an introduction to the problem and show an empirical evaluation of the heat equation as an application of the technique. A comparison between the new and traditional approaches is given.

Reference-contexts: Domain decomposition involves dividing the domain of a problem definition into subdomains and solving the subdomain problems simultaneously. Much of the application of domain decomposition for solving partial differential equations has been for elliptic equations <ref> [1, 2, 5] </ref>, which are often characterized by a closed system that requires a solution of equilibrium conditions. Dawson, Du and DuPont [3, 4] recently devised an efficient scheme for solving parabolic equations (to which we will refer as the DDD method).

For this study, H = 2h and t=H 2 is 1=8; hence, t = H 2 =8 or h 2 =2. All values on the right-hand side of the Equation 2 are known.
