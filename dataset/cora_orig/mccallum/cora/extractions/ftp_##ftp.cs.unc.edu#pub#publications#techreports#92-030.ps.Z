Abstract: This report describes the design and construction of a 30-degree see-through head-mounted display (STHMD). The design goals for this STHMD were that it employ calibrated means of adjusting the virtual image distance (focus) and inter-pupillary distance (IPD) and provide for adjustment of exit pupil location with respect to individual wearers. The optics were designed by Jannick Rolland to incorporate off-the-shelf optical components. A head-on view of the STHMD optical assembly is shown in Figure 1. The liquid crystal display (LCD) units are on the extreme right and left sides. The optical path for each side proceeds from the LCD to a fold mirror, where a 90 downward turn occurs. It then passes through a 2-element magnifying lens, followed by a partially (30%) transparent mirror. The reflected (70%) LCD image is deflected 90 into the eye of the viewer, who simultaneously sees the real world scene transmitted at 30% intensity through the semi-transparent mirror. The display elements for the STHMD are Sony LCD Color Monitors (Model FDL-330S). Each display area measures 54 by 40 mm (67 mm diagonal) and consists of 240 rows with approximately 340 single-primary pixels in each row. The actual LCD pixel plane is located 4 mm in optical path length (including refractive index effects) behind the front display plastic window. The Sony units come in three modules: the LCD monitor with associated drive electronics, an rf video receiver assembly, and a battery/auxillary power pack. The rf video receiver assembly was not needed in the STHMD application. The battery/auxillary power pack was retained because it provided a convenient external power connection and mounting recess for attaching the LCD unit to the STHMD mechanical structure without adding significant weight. The STHMD was designed to provide several opto-mechanical adjustments. Because of the small 1 cm diameter exit pupil of the optical system, the STHMD has variable interpupillary distance which can be set within a 55 to 75 mm range. To accomplish this adjustment, the left and right display and optical assemblies move apart or together while maintaining parallel optical
