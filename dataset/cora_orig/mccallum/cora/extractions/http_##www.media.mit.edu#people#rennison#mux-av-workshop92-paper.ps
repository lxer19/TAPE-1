Abstract: This paper describes a data-processing model providing the synchronization, integration and hyperpresentation of multimedia data. This model consists of three layers: (1) stream, (2) multimedia presentation, and (3) hyperpresentation. This paper describes the data abstractions associated with each layer, defines the services provided by each layer, and describes the mechanisms that provide those services. A sample scenario is presented to illustrate the use of this model. Implementation issues, prototype status, and future directions are also discussed.
