Abstract: Many techniques for speedup learning and knowledge compilation focus on the learning and optimization of macro-operators or control rules in task domains that can be characterized using a problem-space search paradigm. However, such a characterization does not fit well the class of task domains in which the problem solver is required to perform in a continuous manner. For example, in many robotic domains, the problem solver is required to monitor real-valued perceptual inputs and vary its motor control parameters in a continuous, on-line manner to successfully accomplish its task. In such domains, discrete symbolic states and operators are difficult to define. To improve its performance in continuous problem domains, a problem solver must learn, modify, and use continuous operators that continuously map input sensory information to appropriate control outputs. Additionally, the problem solver must learn the contexts in which those continuous operators are applicable. We propose a learning method that can compile sensorimo-tor experiences into continuous operators, which can then be used to improve performance of the problem solver. The method speeds up the task performance as well as results in improvements in the quality of the resulting solutions. The method is implemented in a robotic navigation system, which is evaluated through extensive experimen tation.

Reference-contexts: This may be thought of as a kind of constructive representational change in which raw sensorimotor experiences are compiled into higher-level operators for navigation <ref> (Ram, 1993) </ref>. The learning methods result in improvements in the quality of performance in addition to its speed, which are realized even when the system is faced with a different problem situation each time.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, schema parameters have been fixed and determined ahead of time by the system designer. However, on-line selection and modification of the appropriate parameters based on the current environmental situation can enhance navigational performance, as in the ACBARR system <ref> (Ram, Arkin, Moorman, & Clark, 1992) </ref>. ACBARR can dynamically modify its behavioral parameters in order to perform successfully in different environmental configurations requiring different navigational strategies. SINS adopts this approach by allowing schema parameters to be modified continuously and dynamically.

Reference-contexts: from case-based reasoning and learning, which deals with the issue of using past experiences to deal with and learn from novel situations (e.g., see Kolodner, 1993; Ham-mond, 1989), and from reinforcement learning, which deals with the issue of updating the content of system's knowledge based on feedback from the environment <ref> (e.g., see Sutton, 1992) </ref>. SINS starts out with no knowledge about how and when to modify the schema parameter values, relying purely on reactive control to navigate through the terrain.
