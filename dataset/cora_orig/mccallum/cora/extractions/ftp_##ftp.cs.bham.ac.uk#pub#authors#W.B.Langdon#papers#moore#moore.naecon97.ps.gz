Abstract: programs were independently evolved using fixed and randomly-generated fitness cases. These programs were subsequently tested against a large, representative fixed population of pursuers to determine their relative effectiveness. This paper describes the implementation of both the original and modified systems, and summarizes the results of these tests.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The two-dimensional pursuer/evader problem (2DPE) is a competitive zerosum game in which a faster, more agile pursuer is given a limited amount of time to capture an evader as both are traveling across a plane <ref> [1] </ref>. The game ends favorably for the evader if it manages to stay outside the lethal radius of the pursuer (the maximum distance at which a capture is considered to have occurred) for the duration of the encounter.

Reference-contexts: Genetic programming (GP) is an evolutionary programming optimization methodology that shows considerable promise in bypassing bottlenecks of program development and knowledge acquisition encountered when using traditional programming techniques <ref> [2] </ref>. With GP, programs (in the form of parse trees of primitive functions) are automatically created from random combinations of allowable operations and inputs. Reproduction, crossover, and mutation are used to probabilistically breed each generation of programs from the previous generation. <p> Although GP cannot guarantee the global optimality of a best-of-run program, GP has produced programs whose performances converge towards near-optimal solution for a wide variety of problems, using a population size which is very small relative to the size of the problem space, within a comparatively small number of generations <ref> [2] </ref>, [3]. The GP methodology represents problemsolving strategies in their most natural form: programs .

A Genetic Programming Solution to the Extended Pursuer/Evader Problem As illustrated in Figure 1, our previous solution to the extended two-dimensional pursuer/evader problem (E2DPE) <ref> [4] </ref> modeled pursuer P and evader E as point masses (rather than massless points) whose motions across a plane were controlled by thrusting forces (applied in the direction of the velocity vector) and turning forces (applied in a direction that is perpendicular to the velocity vector).

Reference-contexts: If the evader failed to maneuver, the pursuer captured the evader at (or very close to) the intercept point. If the evader maneuvered, the pursuer relied on the highly effective proportional navigation technique <ref> [5] </ref> to maintain a constant line-of-sight angle with the evader.

During each generation of the GP approach, each member of a population of programs for maneuvering the evader was evaluated against each member of a training population of pursuers. Each GP run optimized maneuvers against a single type of pursuer. Proportional navigation was used by all pursuers.

Reference-contexts: The line-of-sight distance and the initial velocity vector of the evader were used by the pursuer to predict an intercept point. The pursuer was then launched in the direction of the intercept point, and changed its trajectory only in response to evader maneuvers <ref> [8] </ref>. The aggregate fitness of a specific program reflected its fitness when evaluated against pursuers launched from each of these initial positions. A tableau for the E2DPE problem is shown represent components of position, velocity, and acceleration for both the evader and the pursuer.
