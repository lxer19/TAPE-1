Abstract: In Artificial Intelligence, Psychology, and Education, a growing body of research supports the view that learning is a goal-directed process. Psychological experiments show that people with different goals process information differently; studies in education show that goals have strong effects on what students learn; and functional arguments from machine learning support the necessity of goal-based focusing of learner effort. At the Fourteenth Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, a symposium brought together researchers in AI, psychology, and education to discuss goal-driven learning. This article presents the fundamental points illuminated by the symposium, placing them in the context of open questions and current research di rections in goal-driven learning. fl Appears in AI Magazine, 14(4):67-72, 1993

Reference-contexts: In his model, requirements for filling system knowledge gaps also direct explanation generation, by guiding retrieval and revision of explanations during case-based explanation construction (Leake, 1992). In the context of analogical mapping, Thagard pointed out that goals, semantic constraints and syntactic constraints all affect both analogical mapping <ref> (Holyoak & Thagard, 1989) </ref> and retrieval of potential analogues (Thagard, Holyoak, Nelson, & Gochfeld, 1990). Michalski described the Inferential Theory of Learning, a theoretical framework in which learning depends on input information, prior knowledge, and learning goals.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the passive and static process used in many learning systems, goal-driven learning is itself a planful process in which selection of target concepts and learning strategies is guided by desires and needs for knowledge <ref> (Hunter, 1990) </ref>. Recent research provides growing support for goal-driven approaches to learning, both on cognitive and on functional grounds.

Reference-contexts: that learning goals can also be characterized by the type of reasoning failure from which they arise, as when forgetting gives rise to a goal to learn a new index (Ram & Cox, 1993); Leake examined the types of learning goals that arise from failures during understanding|anomalies|that must be resolved <ref> (Leake, 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In order to learn effectively in such situations, a learning system needs ways to focus the learning process. The need for focusing concept formation is widely recognized in AI, and standard focusing methods have emerged. Inductive learning systems depend on built-in biases to constrain what they learn (e.g., <ref> (Michalski, 1983) </ref>); explanation-based learning systems depend on pre-specified target concepts and appropriate operationality criteria (e.g., (Mitchell, Keller, & Kedar-Cabelli, 1986)). In most systems, these focusing criteria are fixed (cf. (Utgoff, 1986)). However, as circumstances change, the need for learning changes as well.

Reference-contexts: In most systems, these focusing criteria are fixed (cf. (Utgoff, 1986)). However, as circumstances change, the need for learning changes as well. Because inappropriate learning may actually degrade system performance (e.g., <ref> (Minton, 1988) </ref>), effective performance depends on assuring that what is learned actually furthers system goals. Goal-driven learning takes system goals as a starting point in the learning process.

Traditional learning systems take a fixed "target concept" as an input (e.g., <ref> (Mitchell, Keller, & Kedar-Cabelli, 1986) </ref>), or rely on the user to select appropriate examples to define the appropriate concept (e.g., (Winston, 1975)); they also apply fixed learning strategies regardless of circumstances.

Reference-contexts: This differs from learning based on general goal orientations, which results in learning that may later serve a wide range of explicit goals. Data collected by Ng substantiate the influence of particular classes of goals in shaping human learning <ref> (Ng & Bereiter, 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: By knowledge gap or failure necessitating learning: Ram proposed that learning goals can also be characterized by the type of reasoning failure from which they arise, as when forgetting gives rise to a goal to learn a new index <ref> (Ram & Cox, 1993) </ref>; Leake examined the types of learning goals that arise from failures during understanding|anomalies|that must be resolved (Leake, 1992). By the learning that results: Ram and Michalski pointed out that taxonomies may also be based on the type of learning that results. <p> Ram pointed out that goals can affect many parts of the learning process such as focusing attention, controlling what is learned, and determining how to select and combine learning strategies <ref> (Ram & Cox, 1993) </ref>. He stressed the importance of having an explicit representation of learning goals, to support the goal-driven learning process by allowing the reasoner to notice and avail 8 itself of unexpected opportunities to learn something previously identified as important or interesting.
