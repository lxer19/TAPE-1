Abstract: Technical Report AI94-223 May 1994 Abstract An important but often neglected problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence is that of grounding systems in their environment such that the representations they manipulate have inherent meaning for the system. Since humans rely so heavily on semantics, it seems likely that the grounding is crucial to the development of truly intelligent behavior. This study investigates the use of simulated robotic agents with neural network processors as part of a method to ensure grounding. Both the topology and weights of the neural networks are optimized through genetic algorithms. Although such comprehensive optimization is difficult, the empirical evidence gathered here shows that the method is not only tractable but quite fruitful. In the experiments, the agents evolved a wall-following control strategy and were able to transfer it to novel environments. Their behavior suggests that they were also learning to build cognitive maps.

Reference-contexts: The encoding outlined above is not the only one possible; others may prove to be effective. Still, it has several properties that make it well suited for the current task. Theoretically, the longer the bit string to be optimized, the more difficult the genetic optimiazation <ref> (Goldberg, 1989) </ref>. Since any string which completely specifies a non-trivial neural network is inevitably quite long, it becomes important to conserve wherever possible.

Reference-contexts: Such an adaptive mapping ability will be an important contribution to the problem of robot navigation <ref> (Kuipers and Levitt, 1988) </ref>. Based on the results so far, using genetically determined neural networks as processors for robotic agents seems to be a very feasible approach to the tabula rasa learning problem.

Reference-contexts: This is not only a philosophical problem; the lack of semantics in traditional AI programs has given rise to serious practical problems as well. Cases in point are the well-known frame problem <ref> (McCarthy and Hayes, 1969) </ref>, the ability to react appropriately in novel situations and the problem of scalability in general.
