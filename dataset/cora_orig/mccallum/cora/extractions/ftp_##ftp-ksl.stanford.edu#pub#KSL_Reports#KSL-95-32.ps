Reference-contexts: In the discussion below, conceptual graphs will be referred to merely as "concepts". The basic algorithm of KDSA is shown in Figure 1. The low-level search of memory (step 2 in the figure) is conducted by a spreading activation mechanism (see, e.g., <ref> [Anderson, 1983] </ref>). In this formalism, activation is passed 4 1. Assign activation to all nodes in the target. 2.

Reference-contexts: Other approaches to retrieval using spreading activation, including Holland et. al.'s PI [Holland et al., 1986], Anderson's PUPS <ref> [Anderson and Thompson, 1989] </ref>, and the aforementioned EUREKA, all have very limited ability to control the spread of activation, so these systems would have difficulty retrieving semantically distant analogies without the help of external cues. 7 Discussion and Conclusion There are a number of open issues related to this project.

Reference-contexts: Many researchers have classified design along a spectrum of the amount of creativity demonstrated by the designer. Most often, this spectrum is divided into three distinct classes: routine, innovative, and creative design. Some researchers, such as Brown and Chandrasekaran <ref> [Brown and Chandrasekaran, 1989] </ref> and Gero [Gero, 1990] focus on the process of producing the design, making distinctions based on the nature of the design space being searched, the types and quantities used in designing, etc.

Reference-contexts: This approach allows the analogy to focus on high-level process and configuration issues, rather than conditions on low-level variables. Automatically generating a model at a desired level of abstraction for a particular task is an interesting open question, one which has been addressed in <ref> [Falkenhainer and Forbus, 1988] </ref>. The third step in the analogy process, transfer, is not the focus of this project. The transfer step for innovative design presented in Section 3 is simple and needs to be extended in order for IDA to produce detailed designs.

Reference-contexts: For example, the H2O-SOURCE node in the structure graph is actually the same node as the H2O-SOURCE node in the behavior graph and the H2O-SOURCE node in the function graph. 10 11 In this representational framework, the terms "process" and "individual" are borrowed from Qualitative Process Theory <ref> [Forbus, 1984] </ref>. The primitive processes in the behavior of sprinkler irrigation|PUMP, FLOW, and SPRAY|can be thought of as QPT processes.

Reference-contexts: Some researchers, such as Brown and Chandrasekaran [Brown and Chandrasekaran, 1989] and Gero [Gero, 1990] focus on the process of producing the design, making distinctions based on the nature of the design space being searched, the types and quantities used in designing, etc. By contrast, Goel <ref> [Goel, 1989] </ref> classifies design in a way that focuses more on the product, i.e., the design itself 1 .

Reference-contexts: The transfer step will not necessarily involve direct copying of a component|it may be modified in some way during the transfer procedure. Also, after transfer there may be some further adaptation of the new design. Specializing Greiner's definition of useful analogical inference <ref> [Greiner, 1988] </ref>, we will say that an analogy is useful for innovative redesign of an existing device if it, along with the designer's design knowledge, can be used to produce a novel redesign of the existing device that satisfies the existing device's functional specification.

Reference-contexts: it is conceivable that it could cause a human designer or a sophisticated computer design system to generate the idea of drip irrigation, where water is delivered to plant roots by slowly dripping out of porous "capillary" hoses. 5 Implementation and Experiments We have implemented KDSA ID in a BB1 <ref> [Hayes-Roth, 1990] </ref> program called IDA. We ran experiments with IDA retrieving analogues for innovative design in a diverse knowledge base of devices. The knowledge base used for these experiments consists of 29 fully represented models of devices.

Reference-contexts: Edison's invention of the quadruplex telegraph was based almost entirely on an analogy to a water system of pumps, pipes, valves, and water wheels <ref> [Hughes, 1971] </ref>. And actress Hedy Lamarr conceived of a method for coordinating frequencies between sender and receiver in frequency-hopping communication by analogy to a player-piano roll [Simon et al., 1985]. These examples all show the inventor making a connection between two concepts not normally thought of as connected.

Reference-contexts: There are several other projects that deal with the use of analogy in other types of creative thought. Jones and Langley have developed the EUREKA system <ref> [Jones, 1989] </ref> and a model of analogy in scientific discovery compatible with EUREKA [Langley and Jones, 1988]. Like KDSA ID , EUREKA searches for analogues with spreading activation.
Reference: [Kock, 1978] <author> W. Kock. </author> <title> The Creative Engineer. </title> <publisher> Plenum Press, </publisher> <year> 1978. </year>
Reference-contexts: Kock believes in the importance of combining knowledge from multiple disciplines in the invention process, and he points out that a large number of inventions were produced by people who weren't specialists in the field <ref> [Kock, 1978] </ref>. And successful inventor L. W. Andrews describes his own process of invention as follows [Rossman, 1931]: First seek out as many analogies as possible, criticise and eliminate; then examine the small number left by experiment.
Reference: [Koestler, 1965] <author> A. Koestler. </author> <title> The Act of Creation. </title> <publisher> Macmillan, </publisher> <year> 1965. </year>
Reference-contexts: The literature on invention is full of examples of inventions that were guided by semantically distant analogies. Gutenberg invented the printing press after noticing the connection between applying force to impress script on paper and applying force to squeeze grapes in a wine press <ref> [Koestler, 1965] </ref> . Edison's invention of the quadruplex telegraph was based almost entirely on an analogy to a water system of pumps, pipes, valves, and water wheels [Hughes, 1971]. <p> Koestler's idea of bisociation, which he views as characteristic of all creativity, reflects this ability <ref> [Koestler, 1965] </ref>. Middendorf asserts that "...creative persons usually have ability and willingness to explore tenuous connections between only remotely connectable things" [Middendorf, 1981].

C., </address> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: There is a growing body of research on using case-based reasoning for creative design. Kolodner and Wills <ref> [Kolodner and Wills, 1993, Wills and Kolodner, 1994] </ref> describe an analysis of creative designers that shows those designers making substantial use of cross-domain analogy during the design process.

Jones and Langley have developed the EUREKA system [Jones, 1989] and a model of analogy in scientific discovery compatible with EUREKA <ref> [Langley and Jones, 1988] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: KDSA ID , by contrast, is designed to retrieve semantically distant analogies without necessarily being aided by an external cue. Another approach to computational creativity that, like KDSA ID , uses heuristics to evaluate the "interestingness" of a concept is Lenat's AM <ref> [Lenat, 1976] </ref>. However, KDSA ID differs from AM in the way that new concepts are generated: AM created entirely new concepts by modifying slots in existing ones, while KDSA ID retrieves concepts that are already in its knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: Four Stanford researchers provided one or more device descriptions which were converted into models, and many of the other models were based on a more-or-less random traversal of the book The Way Things Work <ref> [Macaulay, 1988] </ref>. The 29 devices represented in the knowledge base are shown in Figure 9. The representations of these devices, along with the type hierarchy of concepts used in those representations, comprises about 1100 total objects.

Reference-contexts: Koestler's idea of bisociation, which he views as characteristic of all creativity, reflects this ability [Koestler, 1965]. Middendorf asserts that "...creative persons usually have ability and willingness to explore tenuous connections between only remotely connectable things" <ref> [Middendorf, 1981] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this way KDSA can use these promising concepts as beacons along the way to the final good analogy. This is very similar to the way that promising intermediate states are used in heuristic search techniques such as hill-climbing or best-first search <ref> [Pearl and Korf, 1987] </ref>. The use of the mapping component of the mechanism to provide feedback to the spreading activation search provides a key distinguishing feature of our approach.

Reference-contexts: This heuristic allows KDSA to search based on the strengths of near-analogies it has seen before. Each time the mapping component encounters a new IC with portions that look good, it sets up a new intersection search <ref> [Quillian, 1968] </ref> to find the intersection of all promising portions it has seen 15 Condition: Newly retrieved IC has some portions P 1 ; : : : ; P n that are within some threshold of meeting the applicable condition from the simi larity metric.

Reference-contexts: Another body of related research lies in the collection of approaches to controlling a spreading activation search. SCISOR <ref> [Rau, 1987] </ref> and GRANT [Co-hen and Kjeldsen, 1987] both use heuristic information to direct a spread of activation in semantic networks. KDSA's search control component is similar to the relatedness condition which controls the spread of markers in SCISOR and 25 the path endorsements which direct spreading activation in GRANT.

Reference-contexts: And successful inventor L. W. Andrews describes his own process of invention as follows <ref> [Rossman, 1931] </ref>: First seek out as many analogies as possible, criticise and eliminate; then examine the small number left by experiment. If this fails begin again with analogies of a quite different type and again follow the process as above. But always analogy is the leading string.

Reference-contexts: And actress Hedy Lamarr conceived of a method for coordinating frequencies between sender and receiver in frequency-hopping communication by analogy to a player-piano roll <ref> [Simon et al., 1985] </ref>. These examples all show the inventor making a connection between two concepts not normally thought of as connected. We have referred to this type of analogy as being semantically distant [Wolverton and Hayes-Roth, 1994, Wolverton, 1994].

Reference-contexts: This description of KDSA will assume that all world knowledge is represented in a single semantic network. Within that semantic network, small subgraphs of nodes and links which represent aggregate concepts are explicitly grouped together as conceptual graphs <ref> [Sowa, 1984] </ref>. Individual conceptual graphs are treated the same as primitive nodes|i.e., they can be associated with other nodes via links, and they can themselves be parts of larger conceptual graphs. In the discussion below, conceptual graphs will be referred to merely as "concepts". <p> The functional descriptions in the device representations are similarly represented as a network of primitive functional processes (e.g., delivery) and the individuals they act on. above. Borrowing from Sowa's graphical format <ref> [Sowa, 1984] </ref>, we show the objects in the representation as rectangles and the relations (which we will refer to as "links") of the representation as circles.
