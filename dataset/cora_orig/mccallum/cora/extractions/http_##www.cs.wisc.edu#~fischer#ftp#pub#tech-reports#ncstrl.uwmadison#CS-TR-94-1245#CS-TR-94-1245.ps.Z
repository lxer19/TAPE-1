Abstract: fl To the referees: We intend this to be a short, pointed note in the tradition of Gustafson's "Reevaluating Amdahl's Law" (CACM May '88, pp. 532-533) or J. Smith's "Characterizing Computer Performance with a Single Number" (CACM Oct '88, pp. 1202-1206). y This paper generalizes the cost model introduced by Falsafi and Wood (Cost/Performance of a Parallel Computer Simulator, in Proceedings of PADS '94, July 1994).

Reference-contexts: He found C.mmp to be three to four times more cost-effective; however, his results were dependent upon the specific processor and (differing) memory costs of these systems. Falsafi and Wood <ref> [2] </ref> investigated the cost-effectiveness of the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel (WWT) parallel simulator. WWT runs on a Thinking Machines CM-5 (the host), but models the processors and memories of alternative cache-coherent shared-memory machines (the targets) with enough detail to run target executables. <p> Acknowledgements This work was performed as part of the Wis-consin Wind Tunnel project, which is co-led by Profs.

Reference-contexts: This model assumes that memory costs the same in a uniprocessor or a parallel system of any size. While this assumption seems reasonable given current technologies, marketing considerations can make parallel system memory more expensive <ref> [3] </ref>. Using this model, costup is: costup (p; m; m 0 ) = f (p) + g (m 0 ) : If memory costs are negligible, then costup is f (p). <p> This result may also call into question the wisdom of time-sharing large-memory jobs without considering memory-processor interaction metrics like the space-time product [1]. Related Work Few papers address the cost-effectiveness of parallel computing. Fuller <ref> [3] </ref> compared the multiprocessor CMU C.mmp (based on the DEC PDP 11/20 and 11/40 processors) with the uniprocessor DEC PDP-10. He found C.mmp to be three to four times more cost-effective; however, his results were dependent upon the specific processor and (differing) memory costs of these systems.

Reference-contexts: This is because the parallel system does not need p times the memory of the uniprocessor, since parallelizing a job rarely multiplies its memory requirements by p. Three decades ago Amdahl argued that each million-instructions-per-second (MIPS) of processing power should be accompanied by 1 megabyte of memory <ref> [4] </ref> (p. 17). Our results can be interpreted as the converse of Amdahl's dictum: Each 1 megabyte of memory should be accompanied by 1 MIPS of processing power.

Reference-contexts: We consider hardware costs, but not software ones since we do not know how to non-controversially measure the latter. All prices are list prices in U.S. dollars as of July 15, 1994 <ref> [5] </ref>. We ignore the volume discounts that may favor uniprocessors. Since we take the ratio of two list prices, our quantitative results also hold exactly when a vendor gives a customer the same discount on both systems. Silicon Graphics products range from low-cost desktop workstations to million-dollar shared-memory multiprocessors.
