Title: Better approximation bounds for the network and Euclidean Steiner tree problems  
Author: Alexander Zelikovsky 
Keyword: Combinatorial problems, approximation algorithms, Steiner trees.

Abstract: The network and Euclidean Steiner tree problems require a shortest tree spanning a given vertex subset within a network G = (V; E; d) and Euclidean plane, respectively. For these problems, we present a series of heuristics finding approximate Steiner tree with performance guarantee coming arbitrary close to 1+ln 2 1:693 and 1+ln 2 p
