Abstract: Traditionally, corners are found along step edges. In this paper, we present an alternative approach corners along ridges/troughs and local minima points. These features seem to be more reliable for tracking. A new approach for sub-pixel localization of these corners is suggested, using a local approximation of the image surface.

Reference-contexts: A good feature point has some singularity in its neigh-bourhood: a high curvature point on an edge, an intersection of curves, or an extermum point in the image (darkest or brightest in its neighbourhood). Most corner detections detect high curvature points in a step edge [7] <ref> [1] </ref> and/or intersection of lines [4]. In this paper we describe some of the drawbacks of the common feature detection for tracking, and suggest a new feature detection method that better suits the correspondence problem. 1.1. <p> This framework can be extended for different types of edges, but high order derivatives are needed. Correspondence is achieved under the assumption that the two images are related by translation. Wang and Brady <ref> [1] </ref> find corners in step edges. Their goal is to obtain features for motion estimation.

Reference-contexts: Some applications, such as navigation and computation of weak calibration (e.g. fundamental matrix and trifocal tensor), require a small set of features that can be tracked with high reliability along an image sequence. Those features can be points (e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>), edges (e.g. [3]) or regions (e.g. [6]). Regions offer more information than edges, which offer more than points. On the other hand, the detection problem becomes more complicated as the feature becomes more general. Since the detection is always difficult, most applications use point features. <p> It often occurs, that a few features from the second image will match one from the first. Different tracking methods differ in the way in which they try to deduce the 'right` match out of these multi-feature correspondences. For example, in <ref> [2] </ref>, they constrain the change in tangent direction and curvature at the feature points. They also enforce symmetry in features, i.e. if feature a 1 from the first image match feature a 2 from the second image according to some criteria, than a 2 must match a 1 too.

Related Work Vieville and Faugeras <ref> [3] </ref> find a step edge in one image and its corresponding edge in a second image. This framework can be extended for different types of edges, but high order derivatives are needed. Correspondence is achieved under the assumption that the two images are related by translation. <p> A step edge will not pass this test. Note that this definition does not assume a certain behavior of the ridge. Most edge detection schemes assume, implicitly or explicitly, that the edge curve does not change brightness, at least locally (see <ref> [3] </ref> for more details). In practice, it is enough to check only in the axes' directions. For each direction, the quadratic curve that minimizes least square error (LSE) along a 1-D window around the pixel is chosen.

We compare our method to Harris and Stephens method <ref> [7] </ref>, as a representative of a step edge corner detector. the corner detection of [7] compared to the features that our method detects. The thresholds were tuned to obtain the same number of features (54, in our method and 55 using Harris and Stephens' detector). <p> We compare our method to Harris and Stephens method <ref> [7] </ref>, as a representative of a step edge corner detector. the corner detection of [7] compared to the features that our method detects.
