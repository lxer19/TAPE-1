Abstract: Metadata is used increasingly in geographic and environmental information systems to improve both the availability and the quality of the information delivered. The growing popularity of Internet-based data servers has accelerated this trend even further. In this chapter we give an overview of metadata schemes and implementations that are common in this domain. Case studies include the Content Standards for Digital Geospatial Metadata of the U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), and the Catalogue of Data Sources (CDS) of the European Environmental Agency. Another activity that we will discuss in somewhat greater detail concerns the UDK project, an international software engineering effort to facilitate access to environmental data. The UDK (Environmental Data Catalogue) is a public meta information system and navigation tool that helps users to identify and retrieve environmental data from the government and other sources. In 1995, first versions of the UDK were made available in Austria and Germany; several other European countries are currently evaluating the system. We will present the UDK data model, its implementation as a distributed information system, and its integration into the World Wide Web.

Reference-contexts: While collection has been mostly manual so far, the automatic extraction of metadata is increasingly becoming an option; Drew and Ying give a concrete example in another chapter of this volume <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> The system allows to store documentation about each layer in a frame-based format. Metadata in Geographic and Environmental Data Management 9 In this volume, Drew and Ying describe a concrete approach to use metadata in order to provide uniform access to a heterogeneous collection of GIS and spatial databases <ref> [3] </ref>. Based on metadata about those systems and their contents, their GeoChange system serves as a navigation and access tool. To a large extent, it is non-intrusive, i.e., it can be implemented on top of an existing collection of independent systems without major changes to the underlying architectures and implementations.

Reference-contexts: Recent legislation reflects this trend. According to a recent directive of the European Union, for example, almost all environmental data that is stored at public agencies has to be made available to any citizen on demand <ref> [4] </ref>. As the last few years have shown, the tendency to exert this right is rising steadily. There is, for example, an increasing demand for up-to-date information on air quality in inner cities, on water quality in coastal regions, and so on.

Reference-contexts: In terms of practical consequences, metadata technology is increasingly being integrated into commercial GIS. Most commercial systems have always maintained some basic metadata on the objects to be administered. ARC/INFO, for example, generates and maintains metadata on the spatial registration, projection, and tolerances of a coverage or grid <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> One trend is to collect more information about the detailed content of the data. Vendors typically choose some bibliography-style format to represent this information; conformity with the FGDC Content Standards (see Section 3.2) is increasingly required. The ARC/INFO component DOCUMENT.AML <ref> [7] </ref> is a typical example of such a tool. Another trend is to describe the history and quality (also called lineage) of data sets and their sources in more detail. Geolineus of Geographic Designs Inc. is a typical tool for this purpose [12].

Reference-contexts: Other than many existing standards (such as VPF), the SDTS is not an exchange format. It rather provides guidelines that need to be translated into a native application-specific format before they can be used. Most GIS vendors provide interfaces and tools for that purpose <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Based on the results of a previous project called CORINE CDS (1985-1989), the EU recently commissioned a study entitled "Catalogue of Data Sources for the Environment Analysis and Suggestions for a Meta-Data System and Service for The European Environment Agency" <ref> [9] </ref>. An essential result of this study was the (hardly surprising) insight that the construction of a European environmental information system from scratch is neither economically feasible nor politically viable. Many member countries already have some kind of national environmental information system.

Reference-contexts: Both vector and raster data of a large variety of data models can be exchanged across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms using the SDTS. The standard is structured into three main parts; the subsequent presentation follows the overview of Fegeas et al. <ref> [10] </ref>. 1. Logical Specification This part contains the logical specification of the entities and data objects used to describe different GIS data models. It consists of three major sections in turn and provides guidelines on how spatial and nonspatial objects (simple or composite) are to be organized, named, and structured.

Further details of the implementation and related issues have been described by Kramer et al. [20, 21]. A somewhat different approach for a WWW implementation of the UDK was suggested in <ref> [14] </ref>. Here, each UDK object corresponds to exactly one Web page. HTML links are used to implement primary and secondary catalogues and to establish connections to environmental data objects. In our view this architecture leads to a much more flexible and user-friendly implementation.

Reference-contexts: Metadata can also help to inventory existing data holdings, to unify naming schemes, and to record relationships between different data items and data sets. This aspect of metadata has recently become very popular as one of the core functionalities of data warehouses <ref> [16] </ref>. The concept of metadata is not new. Online documentation of programs and data sets has been in common use for many years.

Reference-contexts: Metadata may be collected at any of the four phases of the data flow and built into the corresponding data structures. As Kashyap et al. point out in this volume <ref> [18] </ref>, much of the data produced during data aggregation and storage is already metadata, starting with simple database schema information up to high-level semantic abstractions of the available data sets. <p> It should be noted here that other researchers have presented different ways to classify metadata; Kashyap et al. give an overview of related work in this volume <ref> [18] </ref>. The relevance of metadata for the management and analysis of complex data sets has been pointed out early on by McCarthy [26] and pursued further in the area of statistical and scientific databases. Siegel and Madnick [36] built on those ideas, concentrating on possible applications in financial data analysis.

Following Melton et al. <ref> [28] </ref>, further examples of annotative metadata include "information in scientific notebooks, instrument logs, manuals, and reports that document the platform and instrument conditions, the operational environment, interferring sources of noise, and that uniquely identify the software and computer platforms used for analysis, modelling and simulation."

Reference-contexts: To a large extent, it is non-intrusive, i.e., it can be implemented on top of an existing collection of independent systems without major changes to the underlying architectures and implementations. Other trends in metadata management include the inclusion of more spatial elements in the metadata itself <ref> [35] </ref> and the use of metadata to describe and access not only other data sets, but also models and algorithms [23]. Parallel to these application developments, metadata management has become a focus in an increasing number of government R&D projects.

Reference-contexts: The relevance of metadata for the management and analysis of complex data sets has been pointed out early on by McCarthy [26] and pursued further in the area of statistical and scientific databases. Siegel and Madnick <ref> [36] </ref> built on those ideas, concentrating on possible applications in financial data analysis. The IEEE Mass Storage Systems and Technology Committee has 8 Chapter 1 sponsored several metadata workshops whose results are available on the Web (URL http://www.llnl.gov/liv comp/metadata/metadata.html).

Reference-contexts: Geological Survey, an agency under the supervision of the U.S. Department of the Interior. One of the first major results was the development of the Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS), a Federal Information Processing Standard to facilitate the online exchange of spatial data <ref> [37] </ref>. The goal is to accommodate different spatial data models, to preserve topologies, and to maintain even complex relationships, as data is transferred across different computer platforms and software systems. Other than many existing standards (such as VPF), the SDTS is not an exchange format. <p> The only two sections that both standards have in common concern data quality and the data dictionary information; we will discuss this in detail later on. 3.1 The Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) The Spatial Data Transfer Standard (SDTS) <ref> [37] </ref> was designed to facilitate the online transfer of the full range of geographic and cartographic data. Both vector and raster data of a large variety of data models can be exchanged across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms using the SDTS.

Reference-contexts: The implementation of the standard is based on the Executive Order 12906, "Coordinating Geographic Data Acquisition and Access: The National Spatial Data Infrastructure," which was signed on April 11, 1994, by President Metadata in Geographic and Environmental Data Management 11 Clinton <ref> [38] </ref>. In addition to providing a long-needed political foundation for the NSDI, the order requires all government agencies to use the FGDC Content Standards for documenting all new geospatial data it collects or produces as of April 11, 1995.

At about the same time, the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) has started a project on the Harmonization of Environmental Measurements (HEM) [19].
