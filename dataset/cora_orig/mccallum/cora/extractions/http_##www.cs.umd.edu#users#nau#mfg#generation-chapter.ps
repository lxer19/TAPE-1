Abstract: This chapter describes a methodology for analyzing some of the manu-facturability aspects of machined parts during the design stage of the product development cycle, so that problems related to machining can be recognized and corrected while the product is being designed. Starting with the CAD design for a proposed part, our basic approach is to systematically generate alternative operation plans for machining the part, evaluating the capabilities of each operation plan to see which one best balances the need for efficient manufacturing against the need for a quality product. We anticipate that the information provided by this analysis will be useful both to provide information to the manufacturing engineer about alternative ways in which the part might be machined, and also to give feedback to the designer about problems that might arise with the machining.

The AMPS process planning system <ref> [2] </ref> includes a step called "feature refinement," which involves combining a set of features into a more complex feature if it appears that this will optimize the plan, or splitting a feature that cannot be machined into two or more features that can (hopefully) be machined. <p> In addition, mechanistic models have been developed to provide quantitative mappings between machining parameters (such as cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut), to the performance measures of interest (such as surface finish and dimensional accuracy) <ref> [7, 2, 35, 36, 30] </ref>.

This total ordering is not unique, but since totally orders intersecting features, we can prove that we will get exactly the same operation plan regardless of which total ordering is produced by the topological sorting algorithm.
