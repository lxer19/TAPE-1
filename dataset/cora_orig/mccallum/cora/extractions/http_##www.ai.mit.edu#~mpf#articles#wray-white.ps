Abstract: This proposal outlines a special purpose toolkit for use in data analysis. The toolkit is a compiler that uses a graphical language to specify problems, and is able to generate C++ code for solving the problems. The design is able to generate a significant number of the popular learning algorithms now available, including some considered to be at the leading edge of research, and is also able to generate novel hybrids of many existing algorithms. The toolkit will revolutionize the way learning and data analysis is currently performed: rapid prototyping can be used, diagnosis, learning and knowledge The probabilistic approach to data analysis looks at a scientist or engineer's data with a view to developing a probabilistic model of the data that can be used in subsequent discovery by the scientist or diagnosis by the engineer. It is done by the earth scientist, the astrophysicist, the engineer analyzing data from the space shuttle main engine, and the mission controller analyzing telemetry data. Data analysis is greatly aided by the availability of general purpose pattern discovery tools such as unsupervised learning systems, neural networks or statistical regression. These tools, along with widely used data manipulation and visualization packages such as Matlab, IDL or S-Plus are often used in a prototyping context, allowing the user to understand what is happening in the data. However, it is often the case that no one data analysis tool is specifically tailored for the job and several may be tried. Matlab and IDL, for instance, have primitive data analysis capabilities, and S-Plus is more a library of standard methods than a flexible toolkit that can be used in the construction of novel data analysis tasks or the refinement of existing methods. In contrast to these general systems, special purpose systems are also used. Previously we have fielded a number of these special purpose tools (Autoclass, IND), we have designed a number of algorithms that have been implemented by others [Bun91, BW91], and we have had broad experience in combining these with data manipulation and visualization packages on applications. However, like others, our work is often hampered by the slow development time for prototyping the data analysis tools as they are adapted for the application. discovery can now be seemlessly integrated.
