Abstract: pSather 1.1 [2] is a parallel extension of the object-oriented sequential programming language Sather 1.1 [1]. A compiler for sequential Sather is available which is written in Sather. This document describes the basic ideas of the extensions of the sequential Sather compiler to handle pSather programs and is thus a high-level documentation of parts of the pSather compiler. Most of the transformations are presented in form of a transformation from pSather to Sather.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Throughout this document we assume that the reader is familiar with the language definitions of sequential Sather 1.1 <ref> [1] </ref> and the parallel extension pSather 1.1 [2]. Conceptually, the transformation of pSather to Sather is organized in phases, each of which deals with a separate problem of the translation. The document's organization reflects these phases. Note however, that a phase does not correspond with a pass of compilation.
