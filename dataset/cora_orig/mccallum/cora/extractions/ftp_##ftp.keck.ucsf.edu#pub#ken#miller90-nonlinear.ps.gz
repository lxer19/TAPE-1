Abstract: A linear Hebbian equation for synaptic plasticity is derived from a more complex, nonlinear model by considering the initial development of the difference between two equivalent excitatory projections. This provides a justification for the use of such a simple equation to model activity-dependent neural development and plasticity, and allows analysis of the biological origins of the terms in the equation. Connections to previously published models are discussed.

Reference-contexts: We make the following nontrivial assumption: A9 For each input vector (t), Eq. (3) defines a unique output vector o (t). Biologically, this is the assumption that the inputs determine the state of the outputs. Mathematically, this can be motivated by studies of the Hartline-Ratliff equation <ref> [Hadeler & Kuhn, 1987] </ref>. 1 With this assumption, o (x; t) can be regarded as a function of the variables (y; t) for varying y. We now transform from the variables S 1 and S 2 to sum and difference variables. <p> That equation has a unique output for every input, for symmetric B, iff 1 B is positive definite; a more general condition for B nonsymmetric can also be derived <ref> [Hadeler & Kuhn, 1987] </ref>. 3 S (x; t) j 2 fi i (fi; t); 1 X S D (x; fi; t)f D Note that (x; t) = S (x; t) + D (x; t).

Reference-contexts: More generally, given an ensemble of input patterns and the initial distribution of S S , the functions I (x y) and C D (ff fi) could be calculated explicitly from Eqs. 14 and 15, respectively. Similarly, <ref> [Hopfield, 1984] </ref> proposed a neuronal activation rule in which f i and f o are taken to be sigmoidal functions and g is the identity; while many current models (i.e. [Rumelhart et al., 1986]) take f i and f o to be the identity, but take g to be sigmoidal.

Reference-contexts: The result is an equation for the mean value hS D i, averaged over input patterns. The right hand side of the equation consists of an infinite series of terms, corresponding to the various cumulants of the stochastic operators of Eq. 12 <ref> [Keller, 1977, Miller, 1989b] </ref>. However, when and fl are sufficiently small that S D can be considered constant over a period in which all input activity patterns are sampled, only the first term is significant. We restrict attention to that term.

Reference-contexts: that cortical development may act to keep cortical cells operating within their dynamic range. 5 Comparison to the Sum of an Excitatory and an Inhibitory Projection An alternative proposal to that developed here is to study the sum of the strengths of two indistinguishable input projections, one excitatory, one inhibitory <ref> [Linsker, 1986] </ref>. This case is mathematically distinct from the sum of two equivalent excitatory projections, because the Hebb rule does not change sign for the inhibitory population relative to the excitatory population. <p> Thus, direct Hebbian couplings to both S D and S S drive the initial development of S S , rendering it difficult to describe the dynamics by a simple linear equation like Eq. 13. In <ref> [Linsker, 1986] </ref>, two assumptions were made that together lead to the disappearance of this first term. First, the output functions h o , f o and g were taken to be linear. This causes the first term to be proportional to C D . <p> In [MacKay & Miller, 1990], it was shown that these parameters can significantly alter the dynamics, and play crucial roles in many of the results of <ref> [Linsker, 1986] </ref>. In summary, the proposal to study equivalent excitatory and inhibitory projections does not robustly yield a linear equation in the presence of nonlinearities in the output functions h o , f o and g. <p> It is also formally equivalent to that studied in <ref> [Linsker, 1986] </ref> except for the absence of the two parameters k 1 and k 2 . 4 4 Also, lateral interactions in the output layer were not introduced until the final layer in [Linsker, 1986]. They were then introduced perturbatively, so that I was approximated by 1 + B. <p> It is also formally equivalent to that studied in <ref> [Linsker, 1986] </ref> except for the absence of the two parameters k 1 and k 2 . 4 4 Also, lateral interactions in the output layer were not introduced until the final layer in [Linsker, 1986].
