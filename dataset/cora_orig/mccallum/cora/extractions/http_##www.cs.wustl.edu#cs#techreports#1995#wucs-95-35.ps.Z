All the above approaches deal with f low/congestion control and are therefore orthogonal to our work.

Reference-contexts: In addition to high bandwidth, future networks will provide both Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to Page 3 support CM applications and efficient multicast to support multipoint applications. However, before these new network services can be successfully realized, changes are required in the protocol layers [17], the network interface <ref> [3, 20, 21, 25, 35, 44] </ref> and the operating system [27, 31]. In this work, we focus on error control. Specifically, we examine how error control must evolve to support (a) point-to-point CM applications and (b) multipoint applications with a large number of participants.

Reference-contexts: However, as we describe below, the success of this approach is highly dependent on network and connection topology. All of the existing work has focused on receiver controlled implosion. We are not yet aware of any published work on sender-controlled implosion. In <ref> [4] </ref>, the authors proposed a block-based acknowledgment protocol to provide reliable communication and control implosion. In this protocol, the sender knows all the receivers. The sender sends a block of packets and waits for acknowledgments from all receivers. By examining acknowledgments, the sender identifies and retransmits lost packets.

Reference-contexts: The proposed alternatives are to minimize loss with (1) peak-bandwidth allocation, (2) concealment, or (3) Forward Error Correction (FEC) <ref> [5] </ref>. Transmitting variable bit-rate (VBR) traffic requiring deterministic loss and delay guarantees means that peak-bandwidth reservation is needed for the duration of the connection. For applications with high peak-to-average ratio, peak-bandwidth allocation is too expensive and inefficient.

Reference-contexts: They show that retransmission with a 3-frame playout delay and concealment work well together even over transcontinental delays. As we mentioned earlier, we are planning to collaborate with the authors to perform experiments with MPEG data. Other researchers have relied on FEC based error control for audio <ref> [6, 33] </ref> and video [48]. We believe that FEC may be feasible in low bandwidth streams like audio, but not for video, because of the bandwidth overhead. In addition, FEC works best if lost packets are dispersed randomly rather than being lost consecutively. <p> In addition, FEC works best if lost packets are dispersed randomly rather than being lost consecutively. However, there seems to be some controversy as to whether this is true of the Internet and the MBone: the authors in <ref> [6] </ref> find that losses appear to be random, but the authors in [47] have found losses to be correlated. 4. IMPLOSION IN MULTICAST ERROR CONTROL 1 In this section we first describe implosion and how it occurs in multicast error control.

Reference-contexts: To control losses, a mechanism is usually employed for the sender to collect feedback from receivers and adjust the transmission rate to minimize congestion and loss <ref> [7] </ref>. Other researchers propose the creation and concurrent transmission of multiple streams with different rate/quality characteristics, where receivers select and join a stream depending on the level of congestion they experience [2]. <p> However , implosion control is not addressed in the above protocols because the number of participants is assumed to be small. Moreover, these protocols are concerned with providing 100% reliability and therefore provide no latency guarantees, making them inappropriate for many multimedia applications. In <ref> [7] </ref> the authors describe a feedback control mechanism for variable bit rate video over the MBone.

Reference-contexts: This is called playout buffering 1 and the buffering delay is called playout delay. In interactive applications the playout delay is limited by the perceptual tolerance of the user, which is around 200 mSec <ref> [8] </ref>. Therefore, for NTSC video a play-out delay of 100 mSec allows a playout buffer of three frames as shown in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: For example, the cost of setting up and maintaining many-to-many connections is drastically dif ferent in the two environments: many-to-many connections are readily supported on the Internet with IP Multicast <ref> [22] </ref>, but are currently very expensive in ATM requiring the creation of several one-to-many connections (one for each endpoint). In this section we begin by describing the operation of SRM, followed by its performance characteristics and trade-offs.

Reference-contexts: Adopting a variable control-time scheme would lead to variable frame-rate video. However, we do not yet know how the end users would react to such a video stream. The work closest to ours is Partially Reliable Streams <ref> [23] </ref>. PRS use playout buffering and conditional retransmission, but do not deliver data integrity information to the application. An implementation of PRS reportedly exists, but we unable to obtain details and evaluation studies.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we expect that our mechanism will perhaps be used in conjunction with one of the previous ow control mechanisms. A retransmission-based error control mechanism for CM audio applications was proposed in <ref> [24] </ref>. In this work the authors have developed an end-to-end model for packet voice transmission and created a simulation to test their model. In the voice model the control time (playout buffering) between talkspurts is artificially extended when there is loss, to allow additional time for retransmission.

Reference-contexts: One of the most signif icant efforts is the receiver-controlled implosion mechanisms introduced in the eXpress T ransfer Protocol (XTP) in the form of damping and slotting heuristics [46].

Reference-contexts: For applications with high peak-to-average ratio, peak-bandwidth allocation is too expensive and inefficient. However, transmitting VBR with statistical guarantees on loss and delay while reserving bandwidth close to the average will result in a high loss rate. For example, after analyzing a compressed two-hour sci-fi action movie <ref> [29] </ref>, the average bandwidth of the resulting VBR compressed video was 5.34 Mbps and the peak bandwidth almost 3 times higher (15 Mbps). These peaks were infrequent as witnessed by the coefficient of variation (0.23) and therefore reserving peak bandwidth for the duration of the connection is wasteful.

Reference-contexts: The timeout values are typically lar ge (several times the RTD), and therefore timeout loss detection is not appropriate for continuous media applications. W e believe that gap-based loss detection at the receiver with an explicit retransmission request is more appropriate <ref> [30] </ref>. It is important to note, however, that gap-based loss detection is applicable only if the underlying network preserves packet sequence. In gap-based loss detection, each packet contains a sequence number, as depicted in Figure 3.

Reference-contexts: The second difference of RMTP and our work is the error recovery: RMTP uses periodic state exchange to notify the sender of lost data, whereas we rely on explicit requests from the receivers. In <ref> [32] </ref> Log-Based Receiver-reliable Multicast (LBRM) for distributed interactive simulation is presented. The protocol uses a primary logging server and a static hierarchy of secondary logging servers to provide reliability. Data is multicast from the source to all logging servers and receivers, but only the primary logging server sends acknowledgments.

Reference-contexts: Other proposed solutions are based on a hierarchical approach similar to our hierarchical solution. There are some important differences with our work, especially in the way the hierarchy is created and the steps taken to control implosion. We elaborate on these differences next. In <ref> [37] </ref> a Reliable Multicast T ransport Protocol (RMTP) is presented. RMTP controls implosion by dividing receivers in a static hierarchy. The source multicasts data to all receivers, but only a few designated receivers (DRs) return acknowledgments. Receivers are divided into local regions with one DR per region.

Reference-contexts: However, this is a slow-reacting mechanism which aims at providing the source with some idea of the congestion experienced by the multicast group in order to adjust the output of the video coder. The mechanism is not suitable for recovery of lost data. In <ref> [38] </ref>, after studying sender initiated and receiver initiated error recovery, the authors concluded that in multicast communication the burden of error detection and retransmission request should be moved to the receivers.

Reference-contexts: Existing error control mechanisms are unsuitable for these applications because they fail to meet two important requirements: bounded latency, required by CM applications and ef ficient scaling, required by multipoint applications. Error control as implemented in existing transport protocols (e.g., TCP <ref> [39] </ref>) offers 100% reliability at the expense of latency. In CM applications the limited lifetime of the data makes this trade-off inappropriate. CM applications require error control mechanisms that will not violate the application s latency requirements.

Reference-contexts: The work closest to ours is Partially Reliable Streams [23]. PRS use playout buffering and conditional retransmission, but do not deliver data integrity information to the application. An implementation of PRS reportedly exists, but we unable to obtain details and evaluation studies. In <ref> [40] </ref>, the authors have developed an analytic model to study the ef fect of retransmission-based recovery in conjunction with concealment on ATM based networks. They show that retransmission with a 3-frame playout delay and concealment work well together even over transcontinental delays.

Reference-contexts: Y et other researchers propose the use of hierarchically encoded streams, where receivers receive a subset of the encoded layers <ref> [10, 41] </ref>. All the above approaches deal with f low/congestion control and are therefore orthogonal to our work. Our mechanism is an error control mechanism where we attempt to recover lost data rather than make adjustments to the data ow to avoid future congestion and loss.

To control losses, a mechanism is usually employed for the sender to collect feedback from receivers and adjust the transmission rate to minimize congestion and loss [7].

Reference-contexts: Other requirements, however, have a support range that can vary by several orders of magnitude: for example, the number of endpoints a multipoint connection can range from two to possibly thousands (for entertainment audio and video), spanning three orders of magnitude; latency requirements can vary from microseconds (RPC, PVM <ref> [43] </ref>) to milliseconds (interactive audio and video, interactive applications), or seconds (file transfer), spanning almost six orders of magnitude. Creating a communication protocol that can support the complete range of even one such requirement is in itself a challenging task.

Reference-contexts: In addition to high bandwidth, future networks will provide both Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to Page 3 support CM applications and efficient multicast to support multipoint applications. However, before these new network services can be successfully realized, changes are required in the protocol layers [17], the network interface <ref> [3, 20, 21, 25, 35, 44] </ref> and the operating system [27, 31]. In this work, we focus on error control. Specifically, we examine how error control must evolve to support (a) point-to-point CM applications and (b) multipoint applications with a large number of participants.

Reference-contexts: With gap-based loss detection, loss is detected after the reception of a packet, so there is a good possibility that the network loss period is over (assuming no packet-discarding strategies are employed at the network <ref> [45] </ref>). 3.2.4 Conditional retransmission Since data in continuous media has a limited lifetime, the protocol must employ a mechanism to abort retransmission when the time left before presentation is less than the RTD.

Reference-contexts: RECEIVER-CONTROLLED IMPLOSION In contrast to sender-controlled implosion, receiver-controlled implosion has drawn some attention in the last few years. One of the most signif icant efforts is the receiver-controlled implosion mechanisms introduced in the eXpress T ransfer Protocol (XTP) in the form of damping and slotting heuristics <ref> [46] </ref>. Recently, in Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) [28] enhancements to the original XTP mechanisms were presented, targeted again to the Internet environment. SRM is currently gaining rapid acceptance within the IP community. <p> However, as we have argued earlier, the problem of NACK implosion still has to be solved. The first protocol where implosion was addressed is the eXpress T ransfer Protocol (XTP) <ref> [46] </ref> with mechanisms known as the bucket algorithm, damping and slotting. SRM, which was described earlier in detail, has built upon the XTP damping and slotting mechanisms. A problem with SRM and other Internet protocols employing implosion control (e.g.

Reference-contexts: However, there seems to be some controversy as to whether this is true of the Internet and the MBone: the authors in [6] find that losses appear to be random, but the authors in <ref> [47] </ref> have found losses to be correlated. 4. IMPLOSION IN MULTICAST ERROR CONTROL 1 In this section we first describe implosion and how it occurs in multicast error control.

Reference-contexts: As we mentioned earlier, we are planning to collaborate with the authors to perform experiments with MPEG data. Other researchers have relied on FEC based error control for audio [6, 33] and video <ref> [48] </ref>. We believe that FEC may be feasible in low bandwidth streams like audio, but not for video, because of the bandwidth overhead. In addition, FEC works best if lost packets are dispersed randomly rather than being lost consecutively.

Reference-contexts: In our mechanism there is no duplication and signif icantly less redundancy, which is limited only to the local groups, never to the whole multicast group. In the Tree-based Multicast Transport Protocol (TMTP) <ref> [49] </ref> a dynamic hierarchical control tree is created via an expanding ring search. During the search, new domain managers (similar in functionality to our RNs) join the tree by repeatedly broadcasting a SEARCH_FOR_PARENT request by increasing the time-to-live (TTL) value.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, losing data in the network would lower the quality and compromise the entertainment value of the movie. This is especially important for future HDTV. An alternative to peak-bandwidth allocation is to reserve less than the peak bandwidth and attempt to conceal <ref> [50] </ref> lost data by taking advantage of the inherent redundancy in CM applications. Examples of concealment include substitution of lost data with previously received data, interpolation and approximation. Supporters of this approach claim that the network loss rates will be low and thus concealment will be adequate.

Reference-contexts: At the end of our evaluation we will systematically document the tradeoffs of MRTs and have efficient implementations of their components. 8.7 Related work One of the pioneering works on reliable multicast is [13], where a centralized, reliable, totally ordered multicast protocol is described. The Reliable Multicast Protocol (RMP) <ref> [51] </ref> is an enhanced version of the protocol in [13]. Other reliable multicast protocols include [1, 9, 19, 34]. However , implosion control is not addressed in the above protocols because the number of participants is assumed to be small.
