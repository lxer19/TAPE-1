Reference-contexts: Work is in progress in diverse areas, including: 1. Architectural knowledge documentation [GHJV94, GS95, PW92, Joh92, BJ94, LH89] to produce for novices catalogues of proven useful design abstractions (see Section 2.1.1). Such catalogues provide fundamental data for the establishment of design compliance checkers. 2. Architectural formalization <ref> [All95, SG95, SSC96b] </ref> to make descriptions of common design structures like Pipe-and-Filter or Mediator more precise. The result 18 ing formal models and theories lead to a better understanding of the structures. This aids the development of rule bases for checking the invariants and constraints imposed by the structures. 3.
