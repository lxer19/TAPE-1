Abstract: This paper argues that all discoveries, if they can be viewed as autonomous learning from the environment, share a common process. This is the process of model abstraction involving four steps: act, predict, surprise, and refine, all built on top of the discoverer's innate actions, percepts, and mental constructors. The evidence for this process is based on observations on various discoveries, ranging from children playing to animal discoveries of tools, from human problem solving to scientific discovery. Details of this process can be studied with computer simulations of discovery in simulated environments.

Reference-contexts: the bar and the grabbing of the toy? If we can find answers to these questions, we will gain much knowledge about discovery in general. 2.2 Adults Solving a Novel Problem In this experiment, the problem to be solved is to steer a simulated ship through a series of gates <ref> [1] </ref>. The subjects are college students and the device is a video game in which one can steer a moving point on the screen using a joystick.

Reference-contexts: All of these areas bring complementary perspectives to this very challenging question. Whether such a question can be answered, however, is still in debate. To some minds, this is a question outside the scope of natural science, as Einstein put it <ref> [2, pp.125] </ref>: "The supreme task of the physicist is to search for those highly universal laws ... from which a picture of the world can be obtained by pure deduction. There is no logical path leading to these ... laws.

Reference-contexts: One important idea is heuristic search in problem spaces, put forward by Simon and Newell [10]. Based on their ideas, we now have machines that play chess at the grandmaster level, programs that rediscover mathematics concepts [7, 14], and systems that rediscover laws of nature based on historical data <ref> [6, 3] </ref>. Attempts have been made to extend heuristic search by relaxing the assumption that a well-defined problem space must be given prior to the search.

Reference-contexts: For example, most of Piaget's work (for example [11, 12]) has been dedicated to observing and hypothesizing how children make their discoveries. His theory of assimilation is widely acknowledged. In parallel with observing humans, empirical psychologists also seek hints from animals' intelligent behavior. For example, the German scientist Kohler <ref> [4] </ref> spent four years observing a group of apes and their intelligent behavior, especially focusing on how they discover, make, and use tools. All these studies implicitly suggest that there may be a common process behind the discovery activities. <p> We will show that the same process that discovers rotations and momentum can be used to discover genes after a more elaborated search. 2.4 The Intelligent Behaviors of Apes Kohler observed a group of apes for more than four years, from 1913 through 1917. In his book <ref> [4] </ref>, Kohler reported various fascinating experiments on how apes discover, use, and make tools. In one experiment, an adult ape was placed in a room where food was visible in an adjacent room through a door with vertical bars.

Reference-contexts: The purpose is to seek commonality across these seemingly very different discoveries. 2.1 Children Discovering a New Tool Consider an experiment reported in the literature of developmental psychology <ref> [5] </ref>. The subjects of this experiment are young toddlers between 12 and 24 months old. A bar is placed on a rotatable circular platform that is mounted on a table in front of them. An interesting toy is fastened to the bar.

Reference-contexts: What about scientific discoveries? Here, let us look at the discovery of genes by Mendel <ref> [8] </ref>. Mendel's experiments constituted a series of breeding actions and observations on garden peas. The peas were classified according to their observable features. For example, peas of one class may be green and have wrinkles, and of another class may be yellow and have long stems.

Reference-contexts: For example, after observing many swans and noticing that they are all white, one might discover that all swans are white. The question raised by philosophers is how to guarantee the truth of the induced statement. As John S. Mill <ref> [9] </ref> put it, "Why is a single instance, in some cases, sufficient for a complete induction, while in others myriads of concurring instances, without a single exception known or presumed, go such a very little way toward establishing a universal proposition? Whoever can answer this question knows more of the philosophy

Reference-contexts: Since the model is empty at the beginning, D1 has no idea of the effects of action, and it uses a set of heuristics <ref> [15] </ref> to decide what actions to explore. In this case, the following two actions are selected by the heuristics: f PICK (BALL1 PLATE1); PUT (BALL1 PLATE2) g Executing these two actions causes BALL1 to be moved from PLATE1 first to HAND, then to PLATE2. <p> As a result, BALL1 is successfully put on PLATE3, but after PUT (BALL2 PLATE3) is applied, a surprise occurs because BALL2 is dropped on the table instead on 1 The details of the computer implementation of D1 can be found in <ref> [15] </ref>. 10 PLATE3 (PLATE3 already contains BALL1, which is smaller than BALL2). Based on this surprise, D1 revises Rule0, which is responsible for the wrong prediction (hence the surprise), by first finding the differences between the current situation and a previous successful application of Rule0. <p> It notices that the crucial difference is that in the previous situation, the target plate was empty while in the current situation it is not. (To find the crucial difference between two states is a difficult problem; D1 uses a heuristic called "incremental enlargement" <ref> [15] </ref>.) Appending this difference to the condition of Rule0, D1 builds up two new rules, Rule2 and Rule4, to replace Rule0 (the variables ball-x and ball-y must be bound to different balls): Index: Rule2 Condition: INHAND (ball-x)^:ON (ball-x plate)^:ON (ball-y plate) Action: PUT (ball-x plate) Prediction: ON (ball-x plate)^:INHAND (ball-x) Sibling: <p> Once all these rules are discovered, D1 has mastered the hidden "laws" of this environment. It finally plans the actions correctly (i.e., puts the larger balls on the target plate first) and achieves all the given goals successfully. D1 uses standard goal-regression planning, see <ref> [15] </ref> for details. 4.2 The Discoverer D2 (Discovering Mental Relations) As we could see in the last section, D1 has a very special set of percepts suitable for this particular environment.

Reference-contexts: In some cases, when no difference can be found between two states, the search for a difference must be extended into the discoverer's action history. New features defined on such historical differences are called "recursive theoretical terms" <ref> [16] </ref>. We will provide examples of such terms in the descriptions of our computer simulation.
