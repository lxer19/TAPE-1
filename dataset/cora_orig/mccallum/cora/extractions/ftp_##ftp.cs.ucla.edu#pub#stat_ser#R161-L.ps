Abstract: This paper presents recent developments toward a formalism that combines useful properties of both logic and probabilities. Like logic, the formalism admits qualitative sentences and provides symbolic machinery for deriving deductively closed beliefs and, like probability, it permits us to express if-then rules with different levels of firmness and to retract beliefs in response to changing observations. Rules are interpreted as order-of-magnitude approximations of conditional probabilities which impose constraints over the rankings of worlds. Inferences are supported by a unique priority ordering on rules which is syntactically derived from the knowledge base. This ordering accounts for rule interactions, respects specificity considerations and facilitates the construction of coherent states of beliefs. Practical algorithms are developed and analyzed for testing consistency, computing rule ordering, and answering queries. Imprecise observations are incorporated using qualitative versions of Jef-frey's Rule and Bayesian updating, with the result that coherent belief revision is embodied naturally and tractably. Finally, causal rules are interpreted as imposing Markovian conditions that further constrain world rankings to reflect the modularity of causal organizations. These constraints are shown to facilitate reasoning about causal projections, explanations, actions and change.

Reference-contexts: Entailment relations are often characterized using a set of axioms, which can also be used as inference rules. For example, the following five axioms completely characterize p-entailment <ref> [1, 25, 43] </ref>: 1. (Defaults)If ' ! 2 , then ' k c ~ . 2. (Deduction) If j= ' , then ' k c ~ . 3. (Augmentation) If ' k c ~ and ' k c ~ fl, then ' ^ fl k c ~ . 4. (Cut) If <p> These results should carry over to possibility theory as formulated by Dubois and Prade [22], which has similar features to Spohn's system except that beliefs are measured on the real interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. In addition, as Section 5 shows, the system can also accommodate expressions of imprecise observations without loss of tractability, thus providing a good model for weighing the impact of evidence and counter-evidence on our beliefs. <p> Funding was provided in part by NSF grant #IRI-9200918, AFOSR grant #94-1-0173, and MICRO grant #93-124. In addition Moises Gold-szmidt acknowledges the support of an IBM Graduate Fellowship 1990-1992, and Rockwell Science Center IR&D program. A Proofs of Main Results Theorem 1 was proven in <ref> [1] </ref> where rules are interpreted directly in terms of high probability conditional statements. A proof in terms of ranking functions runs along the lines of the proof of Theorem 9 below. Theorem 2 and Corollary 3 appear in [57] and proofs may be found in [33].

By combining order-of-magnitude specifications of probabilities and utilities, we can compare and rank the expected utilities of actions and consequences, conditioned on observations.

Computationally, we can take advantage of the relation between stratified rankings and probability distributions represented in Bayesian networks, to compute default conclusions from stratified rankings. Hunter <ref> [39] </ref>, for example, has shown that the polytree algorithm for probabilistic belief update [54] can be modified slightly 38 and become applicable to a network of belief quantified with a stratified ranking.
