Title: A Microprocessor Design Project in an Introductory VLSI Course  
Author: Richard B. Brown, Ronald J. Lomax and Gordon Carichner 
Note: Section 1. Introduction The students have access to all of the CAD tools needed to support a full-custom design  
Abstract: The introductory VLSI design course at the University of Michigan has been offered for over 10 years. More recently, it has been reorganized around a microprocessor design project. This paper describes the course philosophy and content, and the baseline project from which class projects begin. The introductory VLSI course, EECS427, teaches mask-level layout and integrated circuit design verification. Since students learn most about VLSI through actually doing microsys-tem design, the course is organized almost entirely around term projects. Students design, in groups of two or three, primitive 8-bit microprocessors customized for applications of their choosing. All of the circuit design and layout is done by the students except for I/O pads, and a control PLA which is generated automatically from their state-machine descriptions. Familiarity with custom design issues gives students a solid foundation for work in VLSI at any level. By learning mask-level layout, they are prepared to master any of the ASIC design methods easily, and to be involved in the development of future ASIC technologies. In addition, students learn to design integrated circuits in an environment characterized by a combination of design styles or vertical design approaches. This polygon-level experience also helps students understand and appreciate the higher-level physical design tools used in the advanced course, and gives them the background in physical design needed for developing future VLSI CAD tools.

Reference-contexts: A broad set of CAD tools is required to teach good design methodology. At the University of Michigan, a uniform set of commercial tools is incrementally introduced starting in a sophomore logic design course <ref> [1] </ref>. Our most widely used VLSI design tools are from Mentor Graphics, Cascade Design Automation, and Cadence. Table 1 lists the major tools by function, and shows yearly enrollment and specific tool use in the courses which depend most upon them.
