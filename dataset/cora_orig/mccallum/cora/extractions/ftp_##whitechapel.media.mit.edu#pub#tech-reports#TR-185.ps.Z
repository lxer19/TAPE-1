Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 185 Appeared: Soc. for Information Display 1992 Int. Symp. Digest, Vol XXIII, pp 685-688, Boston, MA, May 92. Abstract Random field models are able to synthesize a large variety of complex patterns with a small number of parameters. This paper discusses the use of a Gibbs random field model as part of an image coding system. In particular, some semantic and perceptual attributes of this model are addressed.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Gibbs random field (GRF) model has been shown to produce a large variety of texture patterns <ref> [1] </ref>. Theoretically it is capable of synthesizing any pattern, including both random and regular textures. In practice, it models two-dimensional stochastic patterns very well with a small number of parameters. In the next section some brief background is given on the GRF. <p> The different models corresponding to this form of the energy are typically called "auto-"models, after Besag [2]. An example of a Gibbs model having an energy function of this form is the auto-binomial model used by Cross and Jain <ref> [1] </ref>. The homogeneous auto-binomial Gibbs energy is s2S ffx s + T ln n 1 X fi r x s x r : This energy function has parameters ff and fi r . <p> However, let us briefly consider two other issues which are as important as bit rate performance: perceptual and semantic performance. 4 Perceptual issues It has been shown recently [6] that the second term in the Gibbs energy of (2) is equiv 1 This procedure is the same as in <ref> [1] </ref>; note that ff can be ignored because of the choice of the synthesis method. alent to a linear combination of pairwise co-occurrence statistics (second order statistics of the graylevels).

Reference-contexts: The single-site potentials are also called the "external field". Note that this energy only specifies interactions between at most two pixels in an image. The different models corresponding to this form of the energy are typically called "auto-"models, after Besag <ref> [2] </ref>. An example of a Gibbs model having an energy function of this form is the auto-binomial model used by Cross and Jain [1].

Reference-contexts: The simplest place to begin studying the GRF for coding is in an assumed homogeneous textured region of an image. Note that the problem of image segmentation to obtain such a region is still an open one, and one which is also actively in-vestigated using the GRF <ref> [3] </ref>. Also, truly homogeneous texture regions are not typical, complicating this assumption. The GRF can be made nonhomogeneous, but at the cost of additional parameters. (This is true for most models.) One example of coding homogeneous texture in a real image is shown in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: Ten iterations of the Metropolis exchange algorithm on a periodic lattice were applied to the initial images, resulting in the synthetic fur patches 1 . The two patches were then inserted back into the image using the multiresolution spline of <ref> [4] </ref> to reduce perceptual boundary effects. The estimation involved for the mandril fur was straightforward. However, in general this is not always the case; in particular, care must be exercised in choosing T [5].

Note that each patch was synthesized with five parameters (approximating 8192 pixels with ten parameters); on this pattern the GRF requires a couple of orders of magnitude fewer coefficients than a DCT.

The GRF is one model (out of many) that could provide a more semantic description for some parts of an image, or for some classes of images. In <ref> [6] </ref> we showed that the auto-binomial GRF parameters correspond to rates of "mixing" and "separation" between different graylevels in an image.

Reference-contexts: For example, the GRF is known to be able to efficiently and accurately represent images of clouds <ref> [7] </ref>. If one had a database of weather cloud images, one might get excellent compression with the random field model.
