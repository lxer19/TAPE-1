Title: Part II Introduction to algebraic algorithms  
Note: 16  
Abstract: An algebraic problem is a problem of computing one or more elements in an algebraic structure from other elements. The complexity is measured by the number of algebraic operations we have to perform to compute the element in question. Example Let M be an n n matrix over the integers. Assume that we want to compute M m for some positive integer m. At the "top level" (The ring of n n matrices) we measure the complexity as the number of matrix multiplications to be used. At this level one element together with a parameter m is given. The complexity is O(log m) (repeated squaring). If we want to go into more details we consider the problem as a problem within the integers. Then the complexity is measured by the number of integer operations involved. Finally we could choose Boolean algebra as the structure of interest. Then the number of bit operation needed are to be determined. Note that all three "levels" are of interest even in the case when Boolean algebra is the structure of interest. It is then an example of the programming paradigm stepwise reflnement. In the flrst section we examine the number of ring operations needed to compute the product of two matrices. Next we look into the problem of handling polynomials. This includes among other things a presentation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which is an extremely useful algorithm used in many applications.
