Abstract: A fundamental assumption made by classical AI planners is that there is no uncertainty in the world: the planner has full knowledge of the conditions under which the plan will be executed and the outcome of every action is fully predictable. These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e., plans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In this paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order contingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the agent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The decision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are planned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes the process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions such as the use of different decision-making procedures.

Reference-contexts: It can only solve problems for which there are valid plans involving ways of discriminating between possible outcomes; the algorithm given here cannot solve the original version of the bomb-in-the-toilet problem, although the extension described in Section 6.5.5 can do so <ref> (Collins & Pryor, 1995) </ref>. The algorithm described in this paper has two major practical limitations: first, the plans it produces are often more complex than necessary; and second, the time taken to produce plans precludes its use on all except simple problems.

Reference-contexts: Just as for contingency planning, the planner is given a set of initial conditions and a goal. However, instead of producing a plan with branches, it produces a set of condition-action rules: for example, universal plans (Schoppers, 1987) or Situated Control Rules (SCRs) <ref> (Drummond, 1989) </ref>. In theory, a reactive planning system can handle exogenous events as well as uncertain effects and unknown initial conditions: it is possible to provide a reaction rule for every possible situation that may be encountered, whether or not the circumstances that would lead to it can be envisaged.

Reference-contexts: In some circumstances, such as in this example, plan complexity could be reduced through the use of run-time variables, which were introduced in ipem (Ambros-Ingerson & Steel, 1988) and used in sensp <ref> (Etzioni et al., 1992) </ref> (see Section 7). When the only uncertainty is in the value that an action parameter takes (which is the case when opening a combination safe) it would be possible to use a run-time variable to represent that parameter, obviating the need for separate plan branches.

Reference-contexts: Planners that interleave planning and execution include ipem (Ambros-Ingerson & Steel, 1988), xii (Golden, Etzioni, & Weld, 1994) and Sage <ref> (Knoblock, 1995) </ref>. All three use the same basic interleaving technique: only when no further planning is possible are steps executed. They thus do not set out to decide in advance exactly when further planning will be necessary, and their plans do not include explicit provision for further planning.

Reference-contexts: Cassandra is thus consistent with the view that planning is the process of making decisions in advance. In this view, contingency plans are plans that defer some decisions until the information on which they are based will be available <ref> (Pryor, 1995) </ref>. Different plan branches correspond to different decision outcomes. Through its use of explicit decision steps, Cassandra distinguishes between sensing or information-gathering actions on the one hand, and decision making on the other. <p> It can only solve problems for which there are valid plans involving ways of discriminating between possible outcomes; the algorithm given here cannot solve the original version of the bomb-in-the-toilet problem, although the extension described in Section 6.5.5 can do so <ref> (Collins & Pryor, 1995) </ref>.
