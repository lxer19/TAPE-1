Abstract: Data-driven model building is an important task of scientific discovery that is seeing real success in the development and application of discovery programs. Most efforts have targeted fields of natural science in which the hypothesis spaces are specialized and deal with domains having considerable formal structure. Less work has been directed toward qualitative areas of social science, in which model building also arises. This paper reports the first automation of a modelling task from linguistic anthropology: the analysis of natural-language kinship terminologies in terms of simpler semantic components. Our approach uses three generic simplicity criteria to comprehensively find all the simplest models that are consistent with kinship data. We have reproduced results from the linguistics literature, but have also found simpler models in some cases. The task has strong generic elements: extracts of the code are applied to other data sets to illustrate this potential.

Reference-contexts: MPD with feature invention does not succeed in reducing significantly the number of uncontrasted classes. Linguistic Phonology. We have recently applied the MPD algorithm to data in phonology (the study of language sounds) from a classic paper that reported a componential analysis of Russian phonemes <ref> (Cherry, Halle, & Jakobson 1953) </ref>. The data set consists of 42 classes (phonemes) and 11 binary features (voiced, etc.); the class individuals are not available from the paper. KINSHIP confirmed that all 11 features are needed, but our second and third parsimony criteria led to simpler solutions than were reported.

Reference-contexts: One reasoning task is: given a newly discovered painting, determine who painted it (classify the painting). This is inductive classification of multiclass concepts, which can be approached in several ways <ref> (Dietterich & Bakiri 1995) </ref>. A second reasoning task is: given the same database, express the differences among these painters in the most parsimonious ways possible. The goal here is to understand in simple ways how the style of these painters differ; the goal is not prediction of heretofore unseen paintings. <p> Such algorithms have no explicit concern with minimizing the use of discriminating features nor minimizing the description of individual classes. There is no correspondence with our three simplicity criteria. There are two main approaches to learning multi-class decision trees <ref> (Dietterich & Bakiri 1995) </ref>. The first approach is to induce a separate classifier for each class.

Reference-contexts: Currently, derived features are invented using two heuristics. The first heuristic is inspired by the Bacon program <ref> (Langley et al. 1987) </ref>: for every pair of numeric features, create two derived features that consist of the product and the quotient of the feature pair.

Reference-contexts: For example, in English the term father denotes a male biological parent, whereas in Seneca (an American Indian language of the Iroquois family), the term ha?nih denotes the male parent, but also what English speakers would call uncle, also the father's male first cousin, and others <ref> (Leech 1974) </ref>. Thus, different meaning structures underly different kinship terminologies, hence the interest of anthropological linguistics in discovering a concise formal description of these meaning structures possessed by the diverse languages throughout the world. <p> A companion paper (Pericliev & Valdes-Perez 1997) for a linguistics audience describes our linguistics contributions, which we summarize here.

Reference-contexts: This should not be hastily interpreted as an inherent characteristic of a language, because the possibility of a unique simplest model depends on the available features and on their specific definitions (there is some variance of feature definitions in linguistic practice). A companion paper <ref> (Pericliev & Valdes-Perez 1997) </ref> for a linguistics audience describes our linguistics contributions, which we summarize here. KINSHIP has reproduced Lounsbury's classic analysis of Seneca (Leech 1974), successfully analyzed a previously unanalyzed language (Bulgarian), and improved on previous analyses of English.
