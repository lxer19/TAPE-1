Abstract: In this paper, we present a scalable VC routing protocol. It is based on the recently proposed viewserver hierarchy, where each viewserver maintains a partial view of the network. By querying these viewservers, a source can obtain a merged view that contains a path to the destination. The source then sends a request packet over this path to setup a real-time VC through resource reservations. The request is blocked if the setup fails. We compare our protocol to a simple approach using simulation. Under this simple approach, a source maintains a full view of the network. In addition to the savings in storage, our results indicate that our protocol performs close to or better than the simple approach in terms of VC carried load and blocking probability over a wide range of real-time workload. fl This work is supported in part by ARPA and Philips Labs under contract DASG60-92-0055 to Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, and by National Science Foundation Grant No. NCR 89-04590.

Most of the VC routing schemes proposed for real-time QoS networks are based on the link-state full-view approach described in Section 1 <ref> [6, 1, 10, 24] </ref>. Recall that in this approach, each end-system maintains a view of the whole network, i.e. a graph with a vertex for every node and an edge between two neighbor nodes. QoS information is attached to the vertices and the edges of the view.

Reference-contexts: Our scheme In this paper, we present a scalable VC routing scheme that does not suffer from the problems of areas. Our scheme is based on the viewserver hierarchy we recently proposed in <ref> [3, 2] </ref> for large internetworks and evaluated for administrative policy constraints. Here, we are concerned with the support of performance/QoS requirements in large wide-area ATM-like networks, and we adapt our viewserver protocols accordingly. In our scheme, views are not maintained by every end-system but by special switches called viewservers. <p> Surprisingly, at high values of , all the viewserver schemes perform better than the simple approach. At = 0:5, the network with the base scheme carries about 30% higher load than the simple approach. This is an interesting result. Our explanation is as follows. Elsewhere <ref> [2] </ref>, we have found that when the viewserver schemes can not find an existing feasible path, this path is usually very long (more than 11 hops). This causes our viewserver hierarchy protocols to reject VCs that are admitted by the simple approach over long paths.

We note that our protocol scales even better on larger size networks <ref> [3] </ref>. In all the viewserver schemes we studied, each switch is a viewserver. In practice, not all switches need to be viewservers. We may associate one viewserver with a group of switches. <p> We expect our viewserver schemes to outperform the simple approach in this realistic setting as the update of views of the viewservers requires less time and communication overhead. Thus, views in our viewserver schemes will be more up-to-date. As we pointed out in <ref> [3] </ref>, the only drawback of our protocol is that to obtain a source route for a VC, views are merged at (or prior to) the VC setup, thereby increasing the setup time.

Reference-contexts: This requires a transport protocol support such as TCP [20]. To implement both kind of sends, we assume there is a reserved VC on each link for sending routing, signaling and control messages <ref> [4] </ref>. This also ensures that routing messages do not degrade the QoS seen by applications. Views and Viewservers Views are maintained by special nodes called viewservers. Each viewserver has a precinct, which is a set of nodes around the viewserver.

Reference-contexts: This reservation amount can be thought of either as the peak transmission rate of the VC or its "effective bandwidth" <ref> [12] </ref> varying between the peak and average transmission rate. VC setup requests arrive to the network according to a Poisson process of rate , each requiring one unit of bandwidth. Each VC, once it is successfully setup, has a lifetime of exponential duration with mean 1=.

In this approach, for each destination a node maintains a set of paths, one through each of its neighbor nodes. QoS information is attached to these paths. For each destination, a node exchanges its best feasible path 3 with its neighbor nodes. The scheme in [13] provides two kinds of routes: pre-computed and on-demand. Pre-computed routes match some well-known QoS requirements, and are maintained using the path-vector approach. On-demand routes are calculated for specific QoS requirements upon request.

Generally, a cost function is defined in terms of the QoS information, and used to estimate the cost of a path to the VC's destination. The route selection algorithm then favors short paths with minimum cost. See <ref> [17, 22] </ref> for an evaluation of several schemes.

Reference-contexts: A traditional solution to this scaling problem is the area hierarchy used in routing protocols such as the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol <ref> [18] </ref>. The basic idea is to aggregate nodes hierarchically into areas: "close" nodes are aggregated into level 1 areas, "close" level 1 areas are aggregated into level 2 areas, and so on.
