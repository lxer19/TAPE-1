Title: An Approximation to Compartmental Neuronal Modelling with Significant Gains in Performance

Abstract: In this paper I present the results of an investigation into modelling neurons by a method that approximates the realistic dynamics achieved by compartmental modelling but with significantly less computation. The method employs artificial neural networks as the components for model-ling voltage and time-dependent conductances, and lengths of membrane. I describe a model of a squid giant axon and indicate the computational gains over a comparable compartmental model. A generalized set of such artificial neural networks could provide the means to conduct fast, large-scale simulations. keywords: neural networks, computational neuroscience, compartmental modelling
