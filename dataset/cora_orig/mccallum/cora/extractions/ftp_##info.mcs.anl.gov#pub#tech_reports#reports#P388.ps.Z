Reference-contexts: The sum inequality on D fffl ((0; 1)) (4) 0 ae Z 1 t fl juj p + 0 oe follows trivially. By existing theory (take I = [1; 1), ffi := (ff fl)=2p &lt; 1, and * = 1 in <ref> [1, Example 1] </ref>) we obtain the sum inequality (5) 1 ae Z 1 t fl juj p + 1 oe on D flff ([1; 1)). Addition of (4) and (5) gives the sum inequality on the entire interval. Set t = s. <p> Then Hardy's inequality for D R ((0; 1] (see [5, Example 6.8 (ii)]), Minkowski's inequality, and the integrability of t fi on (0; 1] gives (7) 0 ae Z 1 t ff ju 00 j p + ju 0 (1)j p : Since <ref> [1, Lemma 2.1] </ref> (8) ju 0 (1)j K 1 Z 2 ju 00 j ; a standard Holder's inequality argument applied to (8) in conjunction with (7) yields that (9) 0 ae Z 1 t fl juj p + 0 oe Since (5) remains valid, addition of (5) and (9) gives <p> Case (iii): If fi &lt; ff p and fi &lt; 1, Hardy's inequality for D L ([1; 1)) (see [5, Example 6.9 (i)]), Minkowski's inequality, Lemma 2.1 of <ref> [1] </ref>, etc., give as in Case (ii) the sum inequality (5). On the other hand since (ff fl)=2p 1, existing theory (see [1, Example 2]) gives (10) 0 ae Z 1 t fl juj p + 0 oe we then add and scale as before. <p> On the other hand since (ff fl)=2p 1, existing theory (see <ref> [1, Example 2] </ref>) gives (10) 0 ae Z 1 t fl juj p + 0 oe we then add and scale as before. Case (iv): If fi &lt; ff p and fi 1, we can show that lim u 0 (t) = 0 by an argument similar to Case (i). <p> Now suppose that fi = ff p. To handle this situation we modify an argument previously given in the proof of [2, Theorem 2.1]: Let OE be a C 1 0 function with support on <ref> [3=4; 1] </ref> such that 0 OE 1 and OE = 1 on [1=2; 1]. Define a bi-infinite partition ft i g 1 1 of (0; 1) by letting t 0 = 1 and t i = 2 i . <p> Now suppose that fi = ff p. To handle this situation we modify an argument previously given in the proof of [2, Theorem 2.1]: Let OE be a C 1 0 function with support on [3=4; 1] such that 0 OE 1 and OE = 1 on <ref> [1=2; 1] </ref>. Define a bi-infinite partition ft i g 1 1 of (0; 1) by letting t 0 = 1 and t i = 2 i . <p> lim Q (u ffi ) lim 2 (1 + ffi) p i (1+ffi) p j It remains to prove (3) in the exceptional case: Let f (t) = t, N = t 1 , W = t 1p , and P = t p1 in condition (C 3 ) of <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Then a calculation shows that S 1 = (*t) p (*t) 1 t ! Z t (1+*) s (p1)p 0 =p ds * Z t (1+*) s 1 ds (*t) 1 t ! p1 This yields by <ref> [1, Theorem 2.1 (iv)] </ref> the sum inequality (24) 0 ae Z 1 t 1p juj p + * p 0 oe We substitute the elementary inequality (1 + *) p+1 2 p into (24) and then minimize 2 p * p 0 Z 1 t p1 ju 00 j p on

Reference-contexts: The other possibilities concerning fi follow a similar logic. Case (ii): Assume fi &gt; f1; ff pg. Then Hardy's inequality for D R ((0; 1] (see <ref> [5, Example 6.8 (ii)] </ref>), Minkowski's inequality, and the integrability of t fi on (0; 1] gives (7) 0 ae Z 1 t ff ju 00 j p + ju 0 (1)j p : Since [1, Lemma 2.1] (8) ju 0 (1)j K 1 Z 2 ju 00 j ; a standard <p> Case (iii): If fi &lt; ff p and fi &lt; 1, Hardy's inequality for D L ([1; 1)) (see <ref> [5, Example 6.9 (i)] </ref>), Minkowski's inequality, Lemma 2.1 of [1], etc., give as in Case (ii) the sum inequality (5). <p> Case (iv): If fi &lt; ff p and fi 1, we can show that lim u 0 (t) = 0 by an argument similar to Case (i). Hardy's inequality for D R ([1; 1)) (see <ref> [5, Example 6.9 (ii)] </ref>) then leads trivially to (5). Adding this to (10) (the argument of Case (iii) continues to apply) and finishing the argument as before completes the proof. Now suppose that fi = ff p. <p> Since fl &lt; 1 the limit is 0. This shows that D fffl ((0; 1)) = D L ((0; 1)). Since ff p &lt; 1, iteration of Hardy's inequality for D L ((0; 1)) (cf. <ref> [5, Example 6.7] </ref>) gives (17) 0 Z 1 t ff ju 00 j p : A REMARK ON A WEIGHTED LANDAU INEQUALITY OF KWONG AND ZETTL 5 Substitution of (17) into (16) yields (2). The case fi &gt; 1, fl &gt; 1 is covered by Theorem 1.
