Title: Parallel Model-Based Diagnosis using PVM

Abstract: The present paper outlines the PVM implementation of a particular approach to model-based diagnosis which uses a Petri net model of the system to be diagnosed. Parallel backward reachability analysis on the state space of the net is used to explain the misbehavior of the modeled system. The analysis algorithm is based on the automatic identification of the parallelism present in the structure of the Petri net model. Starting from the above information, a MIMD message passing program is automatically constructed. PVM has proved to be a useful tool for implementing the above parallel programs; in particular, we tested the approach by implementing a parallel program for a car fault diagnosis domain.

Reference-contexts: The markings of the reachability graph corresponding to the presence of primary causes of the model will represent the possible diagnoses. 2 Parallel Backward Reachability Analysis The backward reachability graph generation is a computationally expensive problem. In order to alleviate it, in <ref> [1] </ref> we have proposed an approach in which the backward reachability graph, corresponding to a particular initial marking for a given BPN, is generated by means of an MIMD, message-passing parallel program which is automatically constructed starting from the structure of the above BPN. <p> The derivation of this parallel program is accomplished by first individuating the available parallelism in a given BPN, by means of an algorithm which partitions the BPN into subnets (see <ref> [1] </ref> for more details on the partitioning technique), and then by generating a process for each subnet. Each process is in charge of performing the backward firing for the transitions in the subnet it corresponds to, so its behavior depends on the type of transitions it contains. <p> In particular, if a given place is an input place for a transition of one of the processes and an output place for a transition of the other one, the former process sends messages to the latter (details can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>.) The computation evolves according to the macro-dataflow paradigm, that is each process starts its computation as soon as enough inputs are available. <p> marking has been specified, ENV computes the set of processes which will participate to the solution of the corresponding diagnostic problem, and will disable the other ones in order to avoid the arise of deadlocks (the set of active processes depends on the marking from which the backward analysis starts <ref> [1] </ref>.) After the computation of a particular solution is completed, the cycle is repeated again, until the user decides to terminate the entire program.

Reference-contexts: to diagnosis, a model of the structure and/or of the behavior of the system to be diagnosed is supposed to be available; the solution to a diagnostic problem is obtained by tracking back the observed misbehavior on the available model, looking for a possible explanation of such a misbehavior (see <ref> [2] </ref> for a complete survey). A Petri net [3] representation of the causal behavior of the system to be modeled has been proposed in [4, 5] with the introduction of the model of Behavioral Petri Nets (BPN).

In particular, backward reachability analysis on the state space of the net is used, since diagnosis is a problem of post-diction rather than prediction.
