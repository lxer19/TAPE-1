Reference-contexts: Cs 137 is product of fission of U 235 ,U 238 ,Pu 239 . Looking at these decay series one finds the following candidates 7 with gamma ray emissions for the peaks in table 4.

Reference-contexts: The amount of light, and ultimately voltage, is related to the energy of the gamma ray photons. Once detected, the voltage pulses are counted. These follow a Possion distribution in which the variance is square root of the expected value <ref> [3] </ref>. = is the expectation value. Combining measurements the error goes down by 1/ p 1 where N is number of measurements [3]. So for multiple counts the error goes to = (1) In this case N is taken to the the number of counts in the observed distribution. <p> Once detected, the voltage pulses are counted.

After a linear least squares fit is done on data, the slope and intercept of the line are determined.

Reference-contexts: After a linear least squares fit is done on data, the slope and intercept of the line are determined. The variance of the slope m and intercept b are correlated, changing one will necessarily change the other. The variance on least squares fit of slope and intercept from reference <ref> [4] </ref> are the following: 2 B b = DB A 2 (2) N X 1 N X x 2 (y i ) 2 A = 1 (y i ) 2 1.2 Measurements Known sources of gamma rays were used to calibrate the system at a specific gain.

Reference-contexts: Data was taken for 62831 seconds. Calibration data from section 1.2 and 1.332 MeV peak of Co 60 enabled the determination of energy peaks. These peaks are at 2.6, 2.10, 1.73, 1.43, 1.06, 0.89, 0.56, 0.03 MeV. From <ref> [5] </ref> the major contributors are 40 K, and from the series beginning with 238 U, 235 U, 232 Th. 137 Cs is considered as well since it was deposited during open air nuclear tests [6]. Cs 137 is product of fission of U 235 ,U 238 ,Pu 239 .
