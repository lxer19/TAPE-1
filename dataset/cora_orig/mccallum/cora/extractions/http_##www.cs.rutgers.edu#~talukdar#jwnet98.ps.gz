Abstract: This paper considers the support of real-time services to mobile users in an Integrated Services Packet Network. In the currently existing architectures, the service guarantees provided to the mobile hosts are mobility dependent, i.e. mobile hosts experience wide variation in the Quality of Service and often service disruption when hosts move from one location to another. The network performance degrades significantly when mobile hosts are provided with mobility independent service guarantees. In this paper we have proposed a service model for mobile hosts that can support adaptive applications which can withstand service degradation and disruption, as well as applications which require mobility independent service guarantees. We describe an admission control scheme for implementing this service model and evaluate its performance by simulation experiments. Simulation results show that, if sufficient degree of multiplexing of the mobility dependent and independent services are allowed, the network does not suffer any significant performance degradation and in particular our admission control scheme achieves high utilization of network resources. Keywords: Integrated Services Packet Networks, mobility, Quality of Service, admission control, performance

Reference-contexts: Jamin et. al.[7] have described a scheme to implement the service model described in <ref> [5] </ref>. As portable computers become more powerful and the accessibility of a fixed network from a mobile host becomes easier, the number of mobile users will grow and additionally the mobile users will demand the same real-time services which are available to fixed hosts. <p> In this paper, we investigate the problems of providing real-time services to mobile hosts in an ISPN. As described in <ref> [5] </ref>, to handle real-time services an enhanced architecture is required for a network. This architecture has five key components. The first component is the nature of service commitments the network can provide. <p> Service Model The service model, we propose, is derived from the service model, containing the two service classes guaranteed and predictive services, described in <ref> [5] </ref> by Clark et. al. Guaranteed service provides a hard or absolute bound on the delay of every packet and is suitable for those applications which cannot tolerate any violation of delay bound. <p> The MIG flows belong to the guaranteed service class; the MIP and MDP flows belong to the predictive class. There are multiple levels of predictive service with widely separated delay bounds. The scheduling algorithm considers only the active flows on a link. The unified scheduling algorithm of <ref> [5] </ref> is used, i.e., guaran teed service is provided by the Weighted Fair Queuing scheduling discipline described in [11,6] and the predictive service is provided by the priority queuing algorithm using the bandwidth leftover from serving guaranteed service.

Reference-contexts: A flow is admitted to the network only if it passes the admission control criteria at each switch or base station where the flow requires reservation. Our admission control algorithm is derived from the measurement-based admission control scheme for ISPN proposed by Jamin et. al.<ref> [7] </ref>. In Reference [7], Jamin et. al. have described a technique to measure the queuing delays, link usage rates of the guaranteed service class and each predictive class. <p> The admission control criteria in our service model will use the same equivalent token bucket filter parameters whenever possible. In addition, we augment the measurement process of <ref> [7] </ref> to measure the token generation rate of the equivalent token bucket filter for each individual active flow. <p> Hence, the admission control algorithms are designed to keep the link utilization below a utilization target v (0 v 1). The appropriate utilization target for a link will depend on the characteristics of the traffic flowing through it (see Subsection 3.2 in <ref> [7] </ref>). 5.2. Admission Control Criteria for MIG service The flow ff, active or passive, is admitted to the MIG service class, if all of the following conditions are satisfied at the switch or base station: 1.

Reference-contexts: The delay bound of level i is smaller than the delay bound of level j for i &lt; j. The aggregate token bucket filter parameter of predictive class j is (r j ; b j ) and is the link capacity such that P N Parekh, in <ref> [11] </ref>, has shown that in a network with arbitrary topology, under WFQ scheduling discipline the delay bounds of a guaranteed flow depends only on its reserved flow rate and its bucket depth. <p> When the packet size is small, i.e. the transmission time of each packet is sufficiently small compared to other delays and hence can be ignored, the worst-case delay, D j , of priority queue level j is given by the following theorem in <ref> [11] </ref>: Theorem 1 Parekh [11]: The worst-case class j delay, with FIFO discipline within the class and assuming infinite peak rates for the sources, is D fl j X b i j1 X r i for each class j. <p> When the packet size is small, i.e. the transmission time of each packet is sufficiently small compared to other delays and hence can be ignored, the worst-case delay, D j , of priority queue level j is given by the following theorem in <ref> [11] </ref>: Theorem 1 Parekh [11]: The worst-case class j delay, with FIFO discipline within the class and assuming infinite peak rates for the sources, is D fl j X b i j1 X r i for each class j.

Reference-contexts: Let M h be the mobility specification of a mobile host h. A flow may be an unicast flow or a multicast flow. For a multicast flow, h will join the multicast group. We assume that the underlying routing protocol is the IETF Mobile-IP routing protocol <ref> [12] </ref>, in which data packets are routed to a mobile host via mobility agents, home agent and foreign agent. The protocol works as follows: 1. The sender sends a P AT H message to h or the mul-ticast group address. 2.
