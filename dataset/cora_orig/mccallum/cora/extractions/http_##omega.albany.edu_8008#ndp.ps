Abstract: DRAFT Deconvolution of Neutron Depth Profiling Spectra with Entropic Priors Carlos C. Rodrguez Department of Mathematics and Statistics State University of New York at Albany E-Mail: carlos@omega.albany.edu March 18, 1992 Abstract An iterative algorithm to deconvolve neutron depth profiling spectra is derived. The method is similar to the EM algorithm used by Coakley [1] but it aims at maximizing the entropic posterior probability instead of the likelihood. This allows to introduce objective and invariant prior information into the problem and it is therefore expected to improve the reconstructions. Basically the same algorithm can be used to reconstruct not just depth but the full three dimensional concentrations of impurities in a sample. General guidelines for computational experiments, to be designed in close contact with NIST scientists, are proposed to evaluate the operating characteristics of the new procedure. 1 Derivation of the Problem I propose to incorporate the available objective prior information to the problem of deconvolution of neutron depth profiling (NDP) spectra by means of the associated family of entropic priors. Entropic priors (see Rodrguez [2]) have desirable theoretical properties and they have been successfully applied to deconvolution problems in image processing. In NDP a sample (e.g. silicon) containing an unknown distribution of impurities (e.g. boron) is bombarded with a beam of neutrons. When the neutrons interact with the impurities radiation is emitted. The energy of this radiation depends on the position of the impurities in the sample in a way that allows to specify p(b; d), the probability of observing intensity d when a particle is produced at position b, from the geometry of the experimental setting. If we assume that the emissions follow a spatial Poisson point process in the region of the sample and we discretize the positions (b = 1; : : : ; B) and energies (d = 1; : : : ; D) 1
