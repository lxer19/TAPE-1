Abstract: Alice has made a decision in her mind. While she does not want to reveal it to Bob at this moment, she would like to convince Bob that she is committed to this particular decision and that she cannot change it at a later time. Is there a way for Alice to get Bob's trust? Until recently, researchers had believed that the above task can be performed with the help of quantum mechanics. And the security of the quantum scheme lies on the uncertainty principle. Nevertheless, such optimism was recently shattered by Mayers and by us, who found that Alice can always change her mind if she has a quantum computer. Here, we survey this dramatic development and its implications on the security of other quantum cryptographic schemes.

Reference-contexts: For instance, multiplying two integers is easy, but there is no known efficient classical algorithm 1 to date for computing the factors of a large composite number <ref> [2] </ref>. In the modern world, a bit commitment scheme may go as follows (see Ref. [8] for discussions of various bit commitment schemes): [Classical Bit Commitment Scheme] 1. Alice chooses her bit b = 0 to be committed to Bob. 2.

Reference-contexts: Thus, an eavesdropper can be discovered readily. Bennett and Brassard had shown in 1984 how quantum cryptography can be used to secure communications between two users against eavesdropping attack through the so-called quantum key distribution scheme <ref> [7] </ref>. This article does not concern quantum key distribution. Instead, we concentrate on a class of more fancy schemes, which are probably more useful in peacetime. The basic theme in those applications is the protection of private information during a public decision. <p> A weakness of a restricted class of quantum secure computation schemes ("multiplexing channel" [12]) as well as the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-type of attack <ref> [7] </ref> which underlines the insecurity of quantum bit commitment and secure computations had already been noted in some pioneering papers. What had not been fully appreciated until the work of Mayers [18,20,21] and ours [19,22,23] was the generality of such attacks. Quantum mechanics is a double-edged sword in cryptology.

Reference-contexts: Since it is a standard result in classical cryptography that some two-party secure computations can be used to implement bit commitment <ref> [9] </ref>, the impossibility of quantum bit commitment must immediately imply that quantum two-party secure computation is generally impossible.

Reference-contexts: One can envisage one day when quantum computer becomes a reality. Then, all classical bit commitment schemes will be unsafe. C. Bit Commitment In The Post-Modern World Following the pioneering works by Wiesner on "quantum money" and "multiplexing channel" <ref> [12] </ref>, various quantum bit commitment schemes have been proposed [7,13-15]. There was a common belief just two years ago that quantum bit commitment is absolutely safe [13,16,17]. <p> C. Lessons We Learn We remark that the attacks used by Mayers in Refs. [18,20,21], by Lo and Chau in Refs. [19,22] and by Lo in Ref. [23] as discussed in this paper, were not new.

Reference-contexts: This is because measurement on an unknown quantum state is an irreversible process. A number of quantum bit commitment schemes have been proposed [7,13-15]. Amongst them, the most well-known one is probably the BCJL scheme <ref> [13] </ref>. The detailed procedure of the BCJL scheme is irrelevant for our discussion. Nonetheless, for completeness, it is listed below. [BCJL Quantum Bit Commitment Scheme] 1. Let * be the average noise level of a quantum communication channel shared between Alice and Bob. <p> Alice encodes her commitment as some polarization of photons that is unknown to Bob. Thus, it is impossible for Bob to determine Alice's choice before she opens her commitment. Indeed, Brassard et al. <ref> [13] </ref> have already proven the security of the BCJL scheme against a cheating Bob. The alleged security of this scheme against a cheating Alice is, however, flawed. Mayers [18] and, independently, we ourselves [19] showed that Alice can cheat successfully if she has a quantum computer.

As it turns out, the same cheating strategy can break not only all the existing schemes, but also all quantum bit commitment schemes [20-22] that one can possibly construct. <p> She can then declare that b = 1 and execute the opening phase for b = 1 accordingly. There is absolutely no way for Bob to defeat such an attack by Alice. Having considered the ideal case, let us now, following Mayers <ref> [18] </ref>, consider the nonideal case where B 0 differs from B 1 slightly. In quantum mechanics, a good measure of the "closeness" between two density matrices is fidelity [24].

Reference-contexts: In particular, they may raise the following objections: 3 Mayers proved that all quantum bit commitment schemes are insecure in Refs. [20,21]. Here we will, however, follow our discussion of the same result in Refs. <ref> [22] </ref>. 6 Question 1: Communications by classical means between Alice and Bob is not considered. Answer 1: Since classical communications are a special case of quantum communications, they can be done on a quantum channel and there is no need to give them any special consideration. <p> Here we are considering the ideal case. The non-ideal case where the state is only approximately an eigenstate of f (x; y 1 ) does not change the essential argument [23]. 7 Another interesting protocol is quantum coin tossing, we have shown in Ref. <ref> [22] </ref> that ideal quantum coin tossing (that completely forbids successful cheating) is impossible. It is still open whether non-ideal coin tossing is achievable.

Reference-contexts: However, a fake teller machine does not know which y to use as the input. Using a random y will give it very little information about x. The insecurity of quantum one-sided two-party secure computations was finally demonstrated explicitly by one of us <ref> [23] </ref>, who showed that a cheating Bob can learn f (x; y) for all values of y. This is a fatal violation of the security requirement. <p> That is, the state of all quantum particles in Alice and Bob's hands when computing f (x; y) and f (x; y 0 ) are related by a unitary transformation involving only particles in Bob's hand <ref> [23] </ref>, as required in the cheating strategy presented in the last paragraph. In conclusion, quantum one-sided two-party secure computations are, in principle, insecure. 7 Even though quantum bit commitment and quantum two-party secure computations are insecure in theory, they may still be secure in practice. <p> Here we are considering the ideal case. The non-ideal case where the state is only approximately an eigenstate of f (x; y 1 ) does not change the essential argument <ref> [23] </ref>. 7 Another interesting protocol is quantum coin tossing, we have shown in Ref. [22] that ideal quantum coin tossing (that completely forbids successful cheating) is impossible. It is still open whether non-ideal coin tossing is achievable. It was also shown in Ref.

[22] that ideal quantum coin tossing (that completely forbids successful cheating) is impossible. It is still open whether non-ideal coin tossing is achievable. It was also shown in Ref. [23] that quantum two-sided two-party secure computations are also generally impossible. 12 spirit that a cryptographic protocol satisfies conventional security requirements, which are usually written in terms of probability and thus implicitly demand that protocols follow the rules of inference in classical probability theory. <p> Therefore, in analyzing quantum protocols a more refined security analysis than what is commonly adopted is needed <ref> [23] </ref>. <p> C.

In quantum mechanics, a good measure of the "closeness" between two density matrices is fidelity <ref> [24] </ref>. In general, given two reduced density matrices B 0 and B 1 of Bob, there are many possible systems A attached to Bob's system B such that the combined wavefunction of systems A and B are pure states j 0 i and j 1 i, respectively.
