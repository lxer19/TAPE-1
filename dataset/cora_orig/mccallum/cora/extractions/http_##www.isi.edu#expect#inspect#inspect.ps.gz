Reference-contexts: Also, for several of its checks, INSPECT relies on the availability of structured descriptions of the objectives according to the grammar proposed in another related document and incorporated in an extended objectives editor in the IFD-4 version of ACPT <ref> [Valente et al., 1996] </ref>. If those descriptions are not available, 2 INSPECT's evaluation capability may become severely limited. * The friendly order of battle (FOB).
