Reference-contexts: The original application of Solomonoff's idea has been to the extraction of grammatical rules (cf. also <ref> [1] </ref>). The aim of this work is to apply the MDL principle to derive semantic properties of individual words, given a set of example sentences.

Reference-contexts: As a matter of choice, we may use the principle of adaptive distance measures <ref> [5] </ref> for clustering.) Assuming that the application of this mechanism to a large data set would yield useful lexical groups such as twig, stick, tube, sac, knife, blade, sheet, stone (manipulable physical objects) or place, replace, stick, pull, slip, put (verbs of placement) we may replace these lexemes by a generic

Reference-contexts: It is assumed that the distributive properties of lex-emes may be described as a set of such signatures and that these signatures may be regarded as semantic features, i.e. the capture important aspects of the meaning of the lexemes (cf. <ref> [6] </ref> for a critical appraisal of this approach). However, the different contexts of a lexeme may be of varying importance. One approach consists in finding those features in a context which, when applied to the representation of the lexeme, leads to a maximally compressed version of the text.
