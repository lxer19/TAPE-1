Abstract: Smart spaces will be composed of thousands of computing elements interacting with the physical world. We argue that automatic configuration and resource discovery remains an important unsolved problem in smart-space deployment.

Reference-contexts: Approaches to relax these constraints are important if smart spaces are to apply to a range of link layers and to interoperate with IPv4 systems. At the transport layer, smart spaces suggest wide use of multi-cast protocols <ref> [1, 6] </ref>. Multicast protocols allow groups of devices or a user and a group of sensors to interact efficiently. Multicast group addresses decouple the data sender and list of recipients. With thousands of nodes where weak connections and node failure may be common, flexible group membership is critical.

Reference-contexts: Finally, announce/listen-style multicast-based protocols and soft-state simplify failure recovery. Protocols which self-adapt to congestion are vital for smart spaces. Floyd argues that it is the use of end-to-end congestion control and particularly TCP's additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease algorithms that have allowed the Internet to cope with orders of magnitude in growth <ref> [2] </ref>. If smart spaces are to adapt from the very high node densities of a conference room to a relatively sparse city street, similar protocols will be required. 3.

Reference-contexts: For example, devices attached to individual lighting elements of a light panel may coordinate to dynamically vary their overall intensity based on environmental factors. Self-organization protocols build on the basic announce/listen protocols; announcements allow frequent cluster self-organization and reorganization. While existing clustering protocols <ref> [3] </ref> can be adapted to smart spaces, two features distinguish clustering in in this environment: * Clusters for smart spaces frequently overlap. Functionally related devices (e.g., lighting elements) may not be topologically contiguous, and different uses may overlap (full room lighting vs. podium lighting).

Reference-contexts: Finally, a location-equivalent of the Network Time Protocol [8] is needed to allow nodes to benefit from nearby GPS receivers. Although physical location is important, we have argued elsewhere that logical location is often more important to to real world applications <ref> [4] </ref>. (After all, do you care that you're at latitude 33.97988N, longitude 118.43994W, or that you're at work and that you're in your office?) Improving mappings between raw physical location and logical location are key to effective interaction between smart spaces and the environment.

Reference-contexts: At the physical layer, many nodes imply a need for very flexible network connectivity. Wireless technologies are the obvious choice here. Substantial progress has been made both in COTS wireless (for example standardization and widespread deployment of IEEE-802.11 <ref> [5] </ref>) and in the research community (for example, DARPA's GloMo efforts). We believe that flexible wired connections are also important. Wired connections can provide both high-speed connectivity and (if accompanied by power) can eliminate energy constraints. At the network layer fully automated Internet address configuration is a requirement.

Reference-contexts: Supplemental protocols are important to offset these problems. Accuracy of centimeters or tens of centimeters is important to place a node on one side of a wall or the other. The use of alternate protocols may be desired in buildings [14]. Finally, a location-equivalent of the Network Time Protocol <ref> [8] </ref> is needed to allow nodes to benefit from nearby GPS receivers.

Reference-contexts: Two very different approaches address this problem. On one hand we can construct nodes to be field-upgradable. Active Networks initiatives offer promise here [10]. An alternate approach is based on the principle of delay and discard. Nodes interact with very flexible protocols (for example, information buses <ref> [9] </ref>), delaying the need for frequent change. Nodes are designed to be cheap enough that they can simply be discarded when they no longer interoperate. 4. SECURITY CHALLENGES Just as configuration must scale to support hundreds of nodes per person, so must security protocols.

Reference-contexts: We believe that flexible wired connections are also important. Wired connections can provide both high-speed connectivity and (if accompanied by power) can eliminate energy constraints. At the network layer fully automated Internet address configuration is a requirement. IPv6 holds some promise here with a carefully considered autoconfiguration <ref> [11] </ref>, but it assumes that failures can be manually resolved, it bases configuration on globally unique link-layer addresses, and its protocols require a very large address space.
