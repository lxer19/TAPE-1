Reference-contexts: Thus one would expect the 14 C isotopic abundance in an organic liquid scintillator to be extremely low. In fact, the abundance of 14 C in a petroleum-derived scintillator has never been determined. In the Borexino solar neutrino experiment <ref> [1] </ref>, low-energy neutrinos (&lt; 1 MeV) are detected via neutrino-electron scattering in a large target mass of liquid scintillator.

Reference-contexts: The expected neutrino-electron interaction rate in Borexino, for electron recoils above 250 keV, is dominated by 7 Be solar neutrinos and amounts to ~0.5 events/day/ton, assuming the neutrino flux calculated in Standard Solar Models <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. Though the maximum fi energy for 14 C is 156 keV, finite energy resolution and pile-up can create a tail in the fi energy spectrum that extends to higher energy.

Reference-contexts: From these considerations, it is desirable in Borexino that the 14 C/ 12 C ratio not substantially exceed 10 18 . Trace concentrations of 14 C are usually measured with accelerator mass spectroscopy (AMS). The sensitivity of this technique is limited by sample preparation at the 10 15 level <ref> [4] </ref>, corresponding to a radiocarbon age of about 60,000 years. In one atypical measurement, CO samples were prepared from purified methane from a natural gas well and underwent an enrichment process to potentially increase the 14 C/ 12 C isotope ratio.

Reference-contexts: When analyzed with AMS at the IsoTrace Laboratory in Toronto, Canada, by comparing with blank values, an upper limit of &lt; 1:6 fi 10 18 was obtained <ref> [5] </ref>. This result suggested a petroleum-derived scintillator would be satisfactory for the Borexino solar neutrino experiment. However, a direct measurement of the 14 C abundance in a liquid scintillator was considered a necessary prerequisite.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the scintillating volume must be installed in an environment with sufficient shielding against cosmic rays and ambient radioactivity. A prototype for the Borexino experiment, the Counting Test Facility (CTF) <ref> [6] </ref>, was constructed in the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, at an underground depth of ~3500 meters-water-equivalent. The primary objective of this instrument was to measure the abundances of trace radioactive contaminants in a liquid scintillator detector, in particular the abundances of 14 C, U and Th. <p> A schematic drawing of the detector is shown in Fig. 1 and a complete description is published in Ref. <ref> [6] </ref>. Only a short summary is given here. A transparent, spherical nylon vessel forms the active volume of the CTF, and contains 4.8 m 3 of liquid scintillator with density = 0:88 g/cm 3 .

Reference-contexts: The purpose of this procedure was to investigate whether the fluor might be the dominant carrier of 14 C. A comprehensive description of the various scintillator operations is given in Ref. <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. Several data-taking periods were dedicated to background characterization. The "water run" consists of data taken with the CTF filled with water, before the introduction of scintillator into the active volume. This spectrum characterizes the background from Cerenkov light emission by fl-ray and muon interactions in the water buffer.

Reference-contexts: A recent theoretical calculation by Garca and Brown <ref> [10] </ref> of the 14 C fi spectrum shape predicts a shape factor correction, C (W e ), of: C (W e ) = 1 (0:37 0:04)W e ; where W e is the total energy of the electron in MeV. <p> A 14 C/ 12 C ratio of (1:94 0:09) fi 10 18 was found in the scintillator investigated.

Reference-contexts: A non-statistical shape factor for 14 C was first measured by Sonntag et al. <ref> [11] </ref>, with the following form: C (W e ) = 1 9:14W e + 1:5=W e + 8W 2 with the coefficients converted to the same W e units expressed above. <p> An examination of the shape of the fi spectrum found results consistent with the theoretical prediction [10] and with the recent experimental result [12] for the deviation from the allowed statistical shape.

Various scintillator purification operations aimed at the removal of trace contaminants did not affect the 14 C abundance.

Reference-contexts: The size of this correction is in disagreement with the more recent measurement by Wietfeldt et al. <ref> [12] </ref>, which found a smaller shape factor: C (W e ) = 1 (0:45 0:04)W e ; and which is closer to agreement with the recent theoretically-calculated value. <p> A 14 C/ 12 C ratio of (1:94 0:09) fi 10 18 was found in the scintillator investigated.

Reference-contexts: From calibration measurements using the 214 Po ff line, it is known that g (W 0 e ; W e ) has a Gaussian shape. Its width depends on the energy and scales approximately with its square root. For the Fermi function, the tabulated values from Ref. <ref> [14] </ref> were taken and parameterized. A 2 analysis was performed in an energy interval between 60 keV and 250 keV. During minimization, the fi endpoint for 14 C was fixed at 156 keV while the following four parameters were allowed to vary: 1.

Reference-contexts: However, at sufficient depth underground cosmogenic production becomes negligible compared to other production mechanisms involving natural radioactivity. Production of 14 C deep underground can occur through nuclear reactions involving neutrons and ff particles emitted by the surrounding natural radioactivity. The neutron flux deep underground originates chiefly from (ff,n) reactions <ref> [15] </ref> on Al, Mg, Na and other elements in the surrounding rock. The uranium and thorium decay chains supply most of these ff decays (neutrons are also emitted in spontaneous fission of uranium). <p> Using an estimate of the thermal neutron flux in limestone [16] and the above cross sections, Florkowski et al. have estimated an equilibrium activity level of: 4:4fi10 8 14 C decays per minute in one gram of limestone <ref> [15] </ref>. If all of the 14 C atoms in this one gram of rock were swept into one gram of adjacent petroleum (CH 2 -), this would give an isotopic ratio for 14 C/ 12 C in the petroleum of ~5 fi 10 21 .
