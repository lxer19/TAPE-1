Abstract: The goal of the Web-KB project is to develop automatic methods for constructing and maintaining large knowledge bases whose contents mirror those of the World Wide Web. We argue for the feasibility of a system which, given a manually constructed ontology and a seed knowledge base comprising a set of labeled Web pages, learns to instantiate knowledge-base objects and relations from the Web. Such a system could construct a knowledge base supporting concept-oriented queries to the Web, or serve as a resource for Web-based problem solvers and search agents. At the heart of this task are two general sub-problems: identifying instances of the classes, and identifying instances of the relations that are defined in the ontology. The first sub-problem includes the task of recognizing cases in which individual Web pages correspond to the classes of interest, and the second sub-problem includes the task of identifying cases in which pairs of pages instantiate the ontology's relations. We present the results of initial experiments into the use of text classification and relational learning for these tasks, and sketch problems for future research.

Reference-contexts: Because the Web presents new opportunities for acquiring user feedback, much of the work has gone toward modeling user interests through direct interaction (e.g., [1][8]). Similarly, details of Web organization can be treated as classifications for learning, as in <ref> [2] </ref>. The use of ontologies as a means to facilitate automatic processing of Web data has also received attention. SHOE [7] is a proposed extension to HTML with which page designers can annotate their pages, associating them in on-tologic structures, thereby enabling indexing systems to respond to concept-based queries.

Reference-contexts: One approach would be to learn a separate page classifier for each level of the ontology, using a feature set selected specifically for making discriminations at that level. * Learn to classify hyperlinks based on the linguistic structure of the surrounding text. In other work <ref> [3] </ref> we have obtained preliminary results showing that one can learn rules that extract information from flat text based on examining the linguistic parse of the sentence. * Use the learned Web-page classifiers to bootstrap the collection of training examples for the above flat-text information extractor.

Reference-contexts: Below we describe these two steps in turn. 4.1 Using Word Vectors to Classify Web Pages Word-vector-based methods represent a document as a vector, with one entry for each word in the vocabulary. The Probabilistic Indexing approach <ref> [4] </ref> used in this paper classifies a new document d ? by summing, over all words in d ? , the probability that the word is representative of both the document and the class.

Reference-contexts: The Scorpion project [10] adopts the Dewey Decimal system as its ontology and the source of its classes, but does not attempt to model relations between entities. The IICA project <ref> [5] </ref> makes use of large, subject-oriented ontologies, which are applied both at indexing time to organize retrieved pages, and to mediate between user queries and page contents. 7 Discussion In this paper we have explored the feasibility of using machine learning techniques to classify arbitrary hypertext pages on the World Wide

Reference-contexts: One approach would be to parse the natural language text in the Web, and extract its meaning. A more practical alternative is to follow the approach taken by the TIPSTER project <ref> [6] </ref>, in which many text pattern matchers were developed (primarily by hand) to describe specific 3 phrases that allow extracting specific types of information. In this paper we take a third approach which we conjecture is more appropriate for extracting information from the Web.
