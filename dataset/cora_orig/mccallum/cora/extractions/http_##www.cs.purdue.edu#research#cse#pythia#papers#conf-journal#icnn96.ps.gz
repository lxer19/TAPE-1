Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new agglomerative clustering algorithm in which each pattern cluster is represented by a collection of fuzzy hyperboxes. Initially, a number of such hyperboxes are calculated to represent the pattern samples. Then, the algorithm applies multi-resolution techniques to progressively "combine" these hyperboxes in a hierarchial manner. Such an agglomerative scheme has been found to yield encouraging results in real-world clustering problems.

Reference-contexts: They serve as a natural basis for pattern recognition in cases where an object belongs to a cluster not in a binary fashion, but to a certain "degree". The first use of fuzzy sets as a basis for clustering was in <ref> [1] </ref>. A systematic and extensive analysis of the use of fuzzy sets in clustering was made by Ruspini [11]. Further clustering techniques are dealt with in detail in [2].

Reference-contexts: It finds applications in unsupervised concept learning, human sensory processing, discovery, and provides a convenient representation of the input pattern domain. Clustering thus reveals associations between individuals of a population. The clustering problem <ref> [2, 5] </ref> can be formally described as follows: Input A set of patterns X = fx 1 ; x 2 ; x 3 ; : : : ; x n g Output A cpartition of X that exhibits categorically homogenous subsets, where 2 c n Different clustering methods have been proposed <p> cpartition of X that exhibits categorically homogenous subsets, where 2 c n Different clustering methods have been proposed that represent clusters in different ways for example, using a representative exemplar of a cluster, a probability distribution over a space of attribute values, necessary and sufficient conditions for cluster membership etc <ref> [2] </ref>. To represent a cluster by a collection of training exemplars and to "assign" new samples to existing clusters, we use some form of a utility measure. This is normally based on some mathematical property such as distance, angle, curvature, symmetry, intensity that are exhibited by the members of X. <p> It has been recognised [11] that no universal clustering criterion can exist and that selection of any such criterion is subjective and depends on the domain of application under question. Clustering techniques can be divided into three categories <ref> [2, 11, 3] </ref>: (i) Hierarchial Methods, (ii) Graph-Theoretic Methods and (iii) Objective Function Methods. The hiearchial methods are based on agglomerative and divisive ideas to partition the pattern space and are characterized by their computational simplicity. <p> The first use of fuzzy sets as a basis for clustering was in [1]. A systematic and extensive analysis of the use of fuzzy sets in clustering was made by Ruspini [11]. Further clustering techniques are dealt with in detail in <ref> [2] </ref>. Each technique differs in the kind of method it uses to partition the pattern space, the type of partitions generated and the shapes of clusters that it can detect.

Reference-contexts: While the techniques involved are general, our current implementation of PYTHIA operates in conjuction with systems which solve (elliptic) partial differential equations (//ELLPACK <ref> [6] </ref>). The strategy of PYTHIA is to compare a given problem to the ones it has seen before, and then use its knowledge about the performance characteristics of prior problems to estimate those of the given one.

Reference-contexts: The disadvantage of this is that the algorithm requires more than one run through the data in order to achieve "cluster stability" and hence discourages single-pass clustering. 3 Agglomerative Fuzzy Clustering We propose a multi-resolution scheme, similar to computer vision <ref> [7] </ref>, to partition the data into clusters. For clustering at the base of the multi-level pyramid, we use Simpson's algorithm. Then, we operate at different "zoom"/resolution levels to obtain the final clusters. This approach has led to encouraging results from clustering real world data sets.

Reference-contexts: B j assumes the class of B i and vice versa. 4 Experimental Results We have implemented this algorithm and used it on some classical pattern recognition problems like the Iris data set and the famous soybean disease database (from the machine learning repository at the University of California, Irvine <ref> [10] </ref>), as well as on some new data sets from the domain of scientific computation, which we describe below. 4.1 PYTHIA PYTHIA is an intelligent computational assistant [8] that we have developed to automate selecting methods to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). <p> In this case, each pattern belonged to an unique class and hence the clustering algorithm did not run into the problems as in the case of the PYTHIA domain. 4.3 Soybean Disease Database The final data set that we used to test the algorithm was Michalski's famous Soybean Disease Database <ref> [10] </ref>. 4 4.4 Observations 1. We obtained encouraging results for all the data sets considered in this experiment. The number of samples that were clustered with other samples (that were known to belong to the same class) was taken to be a measure of performance.
