Title: On Traveling Incognito  
Author: Giuseppe Ateniese Amir Herzberg Hugo Krawczyk Gene Tsudik 
Date: July 9, 1998  
Abstract: User mobility is rapidly becoming an important and popular network feature. This is especially evident in wireless/cellular networks where user mobility raises a number of important security issues and concerns. Foremost among them is the ability to track mobile users' movements and whereabouts. Ideally, no entity other than the user himself and a responsible authority in the user's home domain (if any) should know both the real identity and the current location of the mobile user. At present, most environments supporting user mobility either do not address the problem at all or base their solutions on the specific features of the user's personal device, e.g., a cellular telephone. This paper discusses a number of issues related to anonymity and location privacy in mobile networks. It reviews current state-of-the-art approaches, identifies their exposures of anonymity and proposes several low-cost solutions which vary in complexity, degree of protection and assumptions about the underlying environment.

Reference-contexts: Each MD-IS controls an area (i.e., domain) covered by a number of MDBSs. Therefore, it only makes sense to discuss anonymity with respect to inter-area mobility. 3 Upon arrival to a new area, the mobile unit first engages in a Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol <ref> [2] </ref> with the local MD-IS. As a result, both parties obtain a shared secret key. Subsequently, the mobile unit encrypts its real identity (Network Equipment Identifier - NEI) and transmits it to the local MD-IS. While seemingly more secure than GSM, the CDPD approach has two major drawbacks. <p> Finally, we discuss the case with the a device based on public key cryptography. Note that all mechanisms discussed below may be complemented with the two-flow Diffie-Hellman <ref> [2] </ref> key exchange protocol over the airlink, a la CDPD [3]. In this case, the entire procedure becomes resistant to passive intruders over the airlink since all messages can be enciphered under the new key.

However, this is unrelated to the problem at hand. (See, for example, <ref> [4] </ref> for a treatment of this subject.) To summarize, this approach provides a reasonable level of conditionally-linkable anonymity, with minimal requirements on the user's device. Robustness is mainly a function of the clock synchronization, and clever techniques can deal with drifts.

Reference-contexts: We do not discuss this approach in detail here, however, a thorough treatment can be found in the work of Samfat et al. <ref> [5] </ref>. 4.4 Contributory Aliases Thus far, we treated authentication and key distribution as services orthogonal to anonymity. We now switch gears and integrate the key distribution and authentication services with alias-based anonymity service.

While theoretically sound, NDM requires non-trivial infrastructure alterations due to the introduction of MIX-s.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, a mobile user can be tracked. This serves as motivation for stronger, unlinkable anonymity. On the other hand, our scope is narrower than general-purpose anonymity such as that desired in anonymous electronic payment mechanisms, e.g., e-cash <ref> [8, 9] </ref>. The techniques presented below are unsuitable for general-purpose anonymity since in a typical mobile environment a user's home domain is always aware of user's current location.

Reference-contexts: The mobile unit then transmits its real identity enciphered with the new key and the intruder can simply decipher the entire transmission. (One obvious fix for this problem is to introduce domain-level certificates.)

Reference-contexts: Note that this scenario is important, since sometimes even a simple device is not affordable; cf., the widely used S/key authentication protocol, which does not require a device <ref> [11] </ref>. Finally, we stress that the size of the state is also important. * AS x Authentication Server of the home domain; also referred to as the home agent. Solutions differ on the storage and processing requirements for the home domain. * AS y Authentication Server of the foreign domain. <p> In fact, the user can just carry the list of aliases on paper, or as a computer file, and use standard authentication mechanisms (that does not support anonymity). These requirements are similar to those of the popular S/Key authentication mechanism <ref> [11] </ref>. Finally, establishing the real identity of the mobile user is only half the work; AS x must then verify the authentication information supplied in the second flow.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, the identity of the payee should not necessarily be made known to the consumer's credit card issuer. There have been several proposals for (limited) anonymous credit cards, e.g., Low et al. <ref> [13] </ref>. 2 Model and Measures of Anonymity Mechanisms The anonymity problem occurs in many different settings, as described above. However, most can be mapped into the following simple model, which we use in this paper. In our model we assume that the "world" is partitioned into administrative domains.

Reference-contexts: Hence, our goal is to construct an efficient key distribution protocol providing implicit key authentication and key confirmation. Implicit key authentication protects against active attacks such as the well-known man-in-the-middle attack <ref> [17] </ref>. Key confirmation, on the other hand, assures one party that its peer is in possession of the correct key. Note that, without key (i.e., alias) confirmation, the mobile user can compute an incorrect key (alias) which, in turn, can greatly complicate the next run of the protocol.
