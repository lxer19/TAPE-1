Abstract: The problem considered in this paper is motivated by the independence between logical and physical topology in Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) based local and metropolitan lightwave networks. This paper suggests logical embeddings of digraphs into multihop lightwave networks to maximize the throughput under nonuniform traffic conditions. The performance of the heuristics is empirically analyzed on various traffic models. Simulation results show that our heuristics perform, on the average, 20% from a computed lower bound. Since this lower bound is not quite tight, we suspect that the actual performance is better. In addition, we show that 5% 20% performance improvements can be obtained over the previous work.

Reference-contexts: The reported results are based on starting with a "greedy" topology and modifying it with branch-exchange operations. The routing problem is solved by using the Flow Deviation method <ref> [12] </ref>. We suspect that the choice of starting topology is one of the reasons that our algorithms outperforms the previous results. Another reason for the performance difference is the step size in the search process. <p> The edge perturbation mode is 2-change operation whereas the branch-exchange operations on digraphs are quite tricky. Finally, Linear Programming for solving the Routing Problem may be a better choice (in contrast to the Flow Deviation method which is suggested in <ref> [12] </ref> for non-linear, unconstraint flow problems). In order to study the sensitivity of our heuristics to different starting topologies, we generated random 3 starting points and computed the standard deviation of minimum congestion for each perturbation mode by gathering information from 30 different starting points.

Reference-contexts: The conjecture is that the problem is still NP hard, with the integrality relaxation on the routing problem, (due to remaining integrality constraint on the edge variables). Therefore, we introduce two perturbation heuristics [33] for approximate solutions based on Variable Depth Local Search [20], and Simulated Annealing techniques <ref> [19] </ref>, respectively. Each heuristic performs a greedy search in an exponentially large configuration space (the set of all CONFs). The direction of the search is guided by the value of a cost function, which is the amount of maximum congestion.

Suggested by Kerninghan and Lin <ref> [20] </ref>, the technique is based on the idea of replacing the search for one modification by a search for a sequence of modifications, using a cost function to direct the search. Our algorithm modifies this technique by enhancing it with backtracking and maintaining an overall best solution.
