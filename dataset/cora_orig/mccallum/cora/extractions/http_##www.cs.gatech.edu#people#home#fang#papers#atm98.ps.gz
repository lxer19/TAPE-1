Abstract: Supporting guaranteed services in a large network requires solutions to many difficult problems. In this paper, we focus on the problem of on-demand routing of virtual circuits with quality of service guarantees. Specifically, we investigate the performance of the ATM Private Network-Network Interface (PNNI) protocol in a large topology with structure reflecting the hierarchy and locality present in internetworks. PNNI uses several techniques to maintain scalability of the routing process; each technique has an associated penalty in performance (i.e., the ability of the protocol to find routes). The tension between scalability and performance is the subject of this paper. We examine the routing performance under a variety of aggregation and topology update conditions. The work described in this paper uses a large-scale simulator being developed as part of the Scalable Self-Organizing Simulation project.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we focus on the problem of on-demand routing of virtual circuits with quality of service guarantees. Specifically, we investigate the performance of the ATM Private Network-Network Interface (PNNI) protocol <ref> [1] </ref> in a large topology with structure reflecting the hierarchy and locality present in internet-works. PNNI uses several techniques to maintain scalability of the routing process; each technique has an associated penalty in performance (i.e., the ability of the protocol to find routes). <p> 7], as well as routing problems specific to ATM networks [19, 20]However, to our knowledge, this is the first relatively detailed PNNI protocol simulation study that is based on a large-scale Internet-type topology. 2 PNNI Overview The PNNI protocol suite is an international draft standard proposed by the ATM Forum <ref> [1] </ref>. PNNI defines a standard interface between switches and groups of switches in an ATM internetwork. The protocol supports automatic topology discovery, reconfiguration to support network changes, and dynamic routing of switched virtual circuits. The protocol is intended to scale to very large global networks. <p> In other words, a logical node is a node at level 1 or above in the hierarchy, while a physical node is a level-0 node. Note that the PNNI specification <ref> [1] </ref> has a slightly different definition: it uses the term level-0 logical node for a physical node. each PGL is played by a physical node, called the role playing physical node (RPPN). The RPPN of a PGL can be determined by recursively following PGLs down the hierarchy to a switch. <p> Bandwidth is released by a tear down message when the call is over. An added twist in PNNI routing is the use of crankbacks. Crankback is "a mechanism for partially releasing a connection setup in progress which has encountered a failure", which "allows PNNI to perform alternate routing" <ref> [1] </ref>. If the failure occurs because a switch that makes a routing decision has inaccurate routing information, it is hoped that crankback can correct this inaccuracy. Once a decision-making switch is told about the failure, it can try an alternative path.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we offer conclusions and directions for future work in Section 5. 1.2 Related Work The impact of inaccurate information on QoS routing is also addressed by other researchers. Guerin and Orda <ref> [6] </ref> discuss the effect of aggregation on routing of connections with bandwidth requirements and suggest using a shortest path algorithm with weights based on the probability that a link can satisfy the bandwidth requirement of the connection.

Reference-contexts: Although this method is theoretically simple, it is practically difficult because it is not clear how to estimate the probabilities when the network conditions are dynamically changing. The inaccuracy caused by delay in receiving routing information updates is not discussed. Shaikh et al. <ref> [7] </ref> study the inaccuracy caused by delayed updates, based on simulations of k-ary n-cube topologies ranging from tens of nodes to 100 nodes. While this improves on previous studies using smaller topologies, it is not immediately clear how the observations apply to more irregular Internet-type topologies. <p> The second contribution [14] provides more detailed guidelines on the crankback procedures. Again, the reasoning in both contributions is based on qualititive analysis.

Routing fail ure occurs if the switch cannot find a path for the call based on its routing computation, i.e., the call is rejected in the first place.

However, quantititive comparisons of routing performance for the aggregation methods are not given.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm we use is competitive call routing, wherein a minimum weight path to the destination is chosen, provided that the total cost does not exceed a certain threshold <ref> [21] </ref>. If the threshold is exceeded, the call is rejected. Bandwidth is reserved temporarily for the call on the path as the signalling message proceeds. The temporary reservation is finalized when the signalling message comes back, if the call is accepted; the reservation is canceled if the call is rejected.
