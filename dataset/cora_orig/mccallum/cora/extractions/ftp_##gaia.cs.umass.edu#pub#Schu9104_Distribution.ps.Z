Abstract: For soft real-time communication systems, packet loss due to excessive delay rather than average delay becomes the critical performance issue. While most previous studies of real-time systems measure loss as a time-average fraction of excessively delayed packets, this paper characterizes the stochastic properties of time-out loss periods for infinite queues, that is, uninterrupted intervals during which the virtual wait is at or above some fixed threshold. We present analytic expressions and numerical techniques for computing both "time-based" measures such as the distribution of periods during which all arriving packets are lost due to excessive delay as well as "packet-based" measures such as the distribution of the number of consecutively lost packets and the number of successful packets between such periods of loss. Both continuous and discrete-time systems are examined. It is shown that the assumption of random packet loss severely underestimates the number of consecutively lost packets. Also, the loss period is found to be independent of the waiting time threshold for the G/M/1

Reference-contexts: Interactive voice, video and distributed measurement and control are examples of such systems that impose delay constraints, but also show a certain tolerance for lost packets. Most previous studies of real-time systems only measure loss as a time-average fraction of missing packets (e.g., <ref> [1, 2] </ref>). In order to judge the "quality" of loss-prone communication, however, it is important to know not just how many packets are being lost, but also whether losses occur in clusters or randomly. <p> The loss as defined here differs from that studied in our earlier work <ref> [1] </ref>, where excessively delayed customers depart before occupying the server. A loss period (LP) is an uninterrupted interval during which all arriving customers would experience a waiting time exceeding h. <p> Defining C C and C B as the number of consecutively lost customers and the number of customers in a busy period, respectively, we have P [C C = n] = P <ref> [C B &gt; 1] </ref> where P [C B &gt; 1] is the probability that the busy period contains more than one customer. Let us apply these results to the M=M=1 queue. <p> Defining C C and C B as the number of consecutively lost customers and the number of customers in a busy period, respectively, we have P [C C = n] = P <ref> [C B &gt; 1] </ref> where P [C B &gt; 1] is the probability that the busy period contains more than one customer. Let us apply these results to the M=M=1 queue. <p> <ref> [C B &gt; 1] </ref> is the probability that the busy period contains more than one customer. Let us apply these results to the M=M=1 queue. With P [C B = n] given by [17, Eq. (5.157)] P [C B = n] = n 2n 2 n1 12n we compute P [C B &gt; 1] = 1 P [C B = 1] = 1 1 + : Thus, P [C C = n] = n + 1 2n (1 + ) 2n ; n &gt; 0: Note that this result differs markedly from the geometric distribution postulated by Ferrandiz [9, Corollary 5.3]. <p> Since the average number of customers per busy period is 1=(1 ), we have that for the M=M=1 queue the average number of consecutive customers lost is E [C C ] = P <ref> [C B &gt; 1] </ref> 1 1 = 1 This result differs markedly from that obtained under the assumption that losses occur independently as Bernoulli events with the time-average loss probability ff.

We conclude by summarizing the work presented and pointing out some issues to be investigated.

Even for the relatively coarse quantization of t = 0:1, the noloss duration agrees quite closely with the approximate analysis.

Reference-contexts: The loss period distribution is independent of the threshold h. For G=G=1 queues, a loss period is stochastically identical to a busy period with special first service. Busy periods with special (or exceptional) first service are covered by Wolff <ref> [15, p. 392-394] </ref>. The independence of the loss behavior from the threshold recalls a similar observation made by Li [16] regarding the buffer overflow process in a packet voice system.

The independence of the loss behavior from the threshold recalls a similar observation made by Li <ref> [16] </ref> regarding the buffer overflow process in a packet voice system. <p> It seems natural to extend these results to finite queues in order to analyze periods of buffer overflow, as was done in <ref> [16] </ref> for a packet voice arrival process. For G=M=1 and D [Geo] =D=1 queues, a busy period can be regarded as a special case of a loss period. Thus, computation of the distribution of busy periods is of particular interest in studying loss phenomena.
