Reference-contexts: Cook and Rackoff show an algorithm for their more restricted "JAG" model that is similar to, but more subtle than Savitch's; it has essentially the same time and space performance. Recent progress has been made on the time-space complexity of ustcon. Barnes and Ruzzo <ref> [1] </ref> show the first sublinear space, polynomial time algorithms for undirected connectivity. Nisan [5] shows that O (log 2 n) space and polynomial time suffice. Nisan et al. [6] show the first ustcon algorithm that uses less space than Savitch's algorithm (O (log 1:5 n) vs. fi (log 2 n)). <p> Any improvement to the short paths algorithm would probably be very useful in designing future small space stcon algorithms. Our algorithm for stcon does not perform nearly as well as the recent sublinear space algorithms for ustcon by Barnes and Ruzzo <ref> [1] </ref>, Nisan [5], and Nisan et al. [6]. This may be due to a fundamental difference between connectivity on directed and undirected graphs.

Reference-contexts: Prior to the present paper, there was no corresponding sublinear space, polynomial time algorithm known for stcon, and there was some evidence 2 suggesting that none was possible. It has been conjectured <ref> [2] </ref> that no de-terministic stcon algorithm can run in simultaneous polynomial time and polylogarithmic space. Tompa [8] shows that certain natural approaches to solving stcon admit no such solution. <p> The main result of our paper is a new deterministic algorithm for directed s-t connectivity that achieves polynomial time and sublinear space simultaneously. While not disproving the conjecture of <ref> [2] </ref>, it shows that the behavior elicited from certain algorithms by Tompa is not intrinsic to the problem. Our algorithm can use as little as n=2 fi ( p log n) space while still running in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: No nontrivial lower bounds are known for general models of computation (such as Turing machines) on either the space, or on the simultaneous space and time required to solve stcon, although Cook and Rackoff <ref> [3] </ref> and Tompa [8] have obtained lower bounds for restricted models. This paper presents new upper bounds for the problem. The standard algorithms for connectivity, breadth- and depth-first search, run in optimal time fi (m + n) and use fi (n log n) space.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the s-t connectivity problem for directed graphs (stcon) is the prototypical complete problem for nondeterministic logarithmic space [7]. Both stcon and the undirected version of the problem, ustcon, are DLOG-hard | any problem solvable deterministically in logarithmic space can be reduced to either problem <ref> [4, 7] </ref>. Establishing the deterministic space complexity of stcon would tell us a great deal about the relationship between deterministic and nondeterministic space bounded complexity classes.

The results of both Barnes and Ruzzo, and of Nisan et al. exploit the symmetry of undirected graphs to group many vertices into one vertex that has the same connectivity prop erties.

Reference-contexts: In computational complexity the-ory, it has an additional significance: understanding its complexity is a key to understanding the relationship between deterministic and nondeterministic space bounded complexity classes. In particular, the s-t connectivity problem for directed graphs (stcon) is the prototypical complete problem for nondeterministic logarithmic space <ref> [7] </ref>. Both stcon and the undirected version of the problem, ustcon, are DLOG-hard | any problem solvable deterministically in logarithmic space can be reduced to either problem [4, 7]. <p> In particular, the s-t connectivity problem for directed graphs (stcon) is the prototypical complete problem for nondeterministic logarithmic space [7]. Both stcon and the undirected version of the problem, ustcon, are DLOG-hard | any problem solvable deterministically in logarithmic space can be reduced to either problem <ref> [4, 7] </ref>. Establishing the deterministic space complexity of stcon would tell us a great deal about the relationship between deterministic and nondeterministic space bounded complexity classes. <p> For example, showing a deterministic log space algorithm for directed connectivity would prove that DSPACE (f (n)) = NSPACE (f (n)) for any constructible f (n) = (log (n)) <ref> [7] </ref>. Unfortunately, this remains a difficult open problem. A fruitful intermediate step is to explore time-space tradeoffs for stcon: the simultaneous time and space requirements of algorithms for directed connectivity. <p> This paper presents new upper bounds for the problem. The standard algorithms for connectivity, breadth- and depth-first search, run in optimal time fi (m + n) and use fi (n log n) space. At the other extreme, Savitch's Theorem <ref> [7] </ref> provides a small space (fi (log 2 n)) algorithm that requires time exponential in its space bound (i.e., time n fi (log n) ).
