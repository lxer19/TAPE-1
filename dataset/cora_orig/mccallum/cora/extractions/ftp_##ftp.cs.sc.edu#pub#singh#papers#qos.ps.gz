Abstract: With rapid technological advances being made in the area of wireless communications it is expected that, in the near future, mobile users will be able to access a wide variety of services that will be made available over future high-speed networks. The quality of these services in the high-speed network domain can be specified in terms of several QOS parameters. In this paper we identify two new QOS parameters unique to the mobile environment guarantee of seamless service and ensuring graceful degradation of service in situations where user demands exceed the network's capacity to satisfy them. A network architecture and a suite of transport level services are proposed that enables these QOS parameters to be satisfied.

Reference-contexts: The reason is that the MH may move out of range of an MSS before receiving all packets from it. In such situations, in our model, the old MSS simply discards these packets and the SH forwards them to the new MSS.

Reference-contexts: Let us further assume that the bandwidth of a channel is 32kbps (as in [10]) and that the cell currently has two mobile users, M1 and M2, each with an open constant bit-rate connection (see <ref> [3] </ref> and section 4) operating at 16kbps. Initially, M1 and M2 receive 1 The reason for this choice is that most proposed standards for communication within a cell such as, the European standard (GSM), the North American standard (IS-54) and another Pan-European standard (DECT) use TDMA (see [10]). <p> These services will be implemented on top of new technology, like ATM, using the four traffic classes <ref> [3] </ref> - connectionless, connection-oriented, constant bit-rate and variable bit-rate (referred to as AAL 1 thru AAL 5 in [13]). Clearly, if mobile users are to have access to these services, the mobile networks will have to provide equivalent traffic classes at the transport layer of the mobile users.

Reference-contexts: The problem becomes even more severe when we consider in-building picocells with very rapid user mobility between cells (because of their small size users move faster through them). <ref> [4] </ref> also discusses a three-level hierarchy for supporting cellular mobile telephone systems. The lowest level of this hierarchy is called the radio infrastructure and consists of mobile users and base transceiver stations (MSSs). The next level consists of base station controllers each of which controls several base transceiver stations.

Reference-contexts: In order to support such high data rates, a microcellular network architecture has been proposed, see <ref> [9, 5] </ref>. Here a geographical region such as a campus is divided into microcells with a diameter of the order of hundreds of meters. <p> Each MSS contains a large amount of buffer space in order to support high-bandwidth applications for the mobile users. Our proposed architecture differs from traditional microcellular architectures, such as <ref> [5, 14] </ref>, in important ways. The network intelligence in those architectures resides in the MSS nodes. The MSS is responsible for routing decisions, tracking of mobile users and forwarding packets for mobile users that have moved into new cells. It is also responsible for providing the negotiated quality of service. <p> The reason is that the MH may move out of range of an MSS before receiving all packets from it. In such situations, in our model, the old MSS simply discards these packets and the SH forwards them to the new MSS.

Reference-contexts: For a mobile user in a car that is moving at 30-40 mph, these blackouts will occur every 5-10 sec (assuming a microcell size between 100 and 200 meters) and may last for as long as half a second (see <ref> [6, 7] </ref>). In this paper, we identify several fundamental open problems related to networking in the mobile environment and propose approaches to solving these problems. These important problems arise mainly because of the mobility of the users and the unpredictability of their motion. <p> In <ref> [6] </ref> we have presented a network-level solution that ensures users do not see any breaks in service. The basic concept behind this solution is the idea of a group. In Figure 3 let us assume that the mobile user is in cell c i at some given time. <p> Notice that the two Supervisor Hosts in Figure 9 share cells at the boundary of their respective domains. This is needed to ensure that groups can be implemented across SH boundaries. Our architecture offers several advantages: * As we discussed in <ref> [6] </ref> seamless communication using groups can be very easily implemented in this architecture. The SH tracks users within its domain and maintains group information for each user. Packets for a particular mobile user are multicast to the MSS nodes that form its current group. <p> Office buildings and other high-density sites will be served by a picocellular network while lower density regions will be serviced by a microcellular network, see <ref> [6, 9] </ref>. An advantage of a smaller cell size is higher throughput (because there will be fewer users per cell), greater frequency reuse (i.e., while adjacent cells use different radio frequencies, non-adjacent cells may use the same frequency) and low-power transmitters (resulting in longer battery life). <p> This enables an easy implementation of groups for seamless communication and simplifies flow-control. We proposed a connection setup and maintenance protocol in <ref> [6] </ref> that uses packets. As discussed there, whenever an MH needs to open a new connection it sends a request to its SH. The SH sets up the connection and returns an identifier to the MH. Henceforth every packet sent along this connection carries its identifier. <p> When, however, the MH moves between cells belonging to different Supervisor Hosts, the new SH adopts all the open connections of the MH. This involves informing the old SH so that packets can be forwarded to the new SH, see <ref> [6] </ref>. Giving new identifiers to all the open connections (since these identifiers must be unique within the subnet).

In this paper, we identify several fundamental open problems related to networking in the mobile environment and propose approaches to solving these problems. These important problems arise mainly because of the mobility of the users and the unpredictability of their motion. <p> In some circumstances, where the mobile user is in a car traveling on a highway, we can fairly accurately predict the future positions of the user and buffer accordingly. However, this 5 is not always possible. In <ref> [7] </ref> we proposed two orthogonal approaches for solving this problem. The first approach is to estimate the latency of the user in a cell and begin prebuffering at neighboring cells (i.e., cells of the group) only after a certain amount of time. <p> Therefore the buffering overhead is only (k 1) fl (t t ) fl d every t sec, where d is the data rate of the mobile user's open connections. If the value of t can be estimated accurately, the predictive buffering overhead can be substantially reduced. In <ref> [7] </ref> we show that if the cell latency of the mobile user is a normal distribution then, in most cases, the buffer overhead is only double. <p> In such situations, in our model, the old MSS simply discards these packets and the SH forwards them to the new MSS. In [1, 5] the old MSS would be responsible for forwarding these packets. The drawbacks of this approach have been discussed in <ref> [7] </ref>. In our model connection maintenance is the responsibility of the SH.

Reference-contexts: A global database combined with source routing was the proposed solution. Obviously this does not scale to networks with a large number of very mobile users. <ref> [11] </ref> proposes a more appropriate solution for mobile computing called the IPIP ("IP-within-IP") protocol. Every MH has a unique IP address called its `home address'. To deliver a packet to a remote MH, the source MSS first broadcasts an ARP to all other MSS nodes to locate the MH.

Reference-contexts: Nodes M, R, S, etc. form the mobile network. Our focus in this section is on developing a mobile network arhitecture that provides a simple way to satisfy the QOS requirements of diverse applications. Corresponding transport layer issues are discussed in section 4. Some authors, for instance <ref> [14] </ref>, view the mobile network as an extension of ATM networks and suggest that the mobile network architecture and protocols be compatible with ATM in terms of functional layers and services so that there is a minimum of protocol processing at the interface between the mobile network and the ATM network. <p> If we adapt the approach in <ref> [14] </ref>, since the QOS parameters for an open connection can no longer be satisfied, the mobile user may, (1) close connections for which the QOS parameters can no longer be met, or (2) renegotiate QOS parameters for these connections. The first solution is clearly undesirable. <p> Furthermore, as we will discuss in section 3.4, communication between the SH and MH nodes takes place via packets containing sequence numbers. Therefore the problems of duplicate or out-of-order data arriving at the MH can be easily handled. Recall that this was a problem with the approach in <ref> [14] </ref>. * An implication of our approach is that it is now possible to have one set of QOS parameters for the mobile part of a connection (between the mobile user and the Supervisor Host) and another set defined for the high-speed fixed network. <p> Each MSS contains a large amount of buffer space in order to support high-bandwidth applications for the mobile users. Our proposed architecture differs from traditional microcellular architectures, such as <ref> [5, 14] </ref>, in important ways. The network intelligence in those architectures resides in the MSS nodes. The MSS is responsible for routing decisions, tracking of mobile users and forwarding packets for mobile users that have moved into new cells. It is also responsible for providing the negotiated quality of service. <p> Network routers associate this VIP address with the IP address of the SH and route the packet accordingly. The SH then forwards the packet to the MH via the MSS in whose cell the MH is currently located. 13 3.4 Connection Management Unlike <ref> [14] </ref> we believe that the smallest unit of communication between mobile users and SH nodes must be variable-sized packets. The reason is that every packet can be numbered and duplicates can be easily discarded by the MH (this is a problem in [14] as discussed in section 3.1). <p> is currently located. 13 3.4 Connection Management Unlike <ref> [14] </ref> we believe that the smallest unit of communication between mobile users and SH nodes must be variable-sized packets.

Reference-contexts: Upon receiving this packet the destination MSS extracts the original packet and attempts to deliver it to the destination MH. If the MH has moved away, the destination MSS attempts to locate it by broadcasting an ARP request. As discussed in <ref> [17] </ref> this method is not easily scalable.

Unlike <ref> [17] </ref>, however, we do not require MH nodes to have an IP address. This is because MH nodes move around so rapidly that there would be little point in assigning them IP addresses.
