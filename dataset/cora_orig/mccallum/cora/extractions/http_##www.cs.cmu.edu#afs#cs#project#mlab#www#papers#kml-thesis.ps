[183]). 1.3.3 Path Planning with Grasp Constraints To plan pushing paths, we must find (1) a sequence of robot pushing motions and (2) the robot's motion between pushes.

Throwing Learning approaches have been applied to improve a robot's ability to throw (Aboaf et al. <ref> [2] </ref>; Schneider and Brown [188]). Throwing a club using a dynamic grasp was previously reported by Mason and Lynch [143, 144]. Batting Batting combines catching and throwing into a single collision.

Reference-contexts: Batting Batting combines catching and throwing into a single collision. Robot juggling by batting has been demonstrated for one or two pucks with a planar juggler (Buhler and Koditschek [46]), a ball in space (Aboaf et al. <ref> [3] </ref>, Rizzi and Koditschek [175]), and two balls in space (Rizzi and Koditschek [176]). The problem of batting a planar polygon to a desired stable orientation was addressed by Zumel and Erdmann [229]. Schaal et al. [186, 185] used batting in their "devil sticking" robot. <p> DYNAMIC MANIPULATION EXPERIMENTS 11.2. EXPERIMENTS 159 160 CHAPTER 11. DYNAMIC MANIPULATION EXPERIMENTS 11.2.

Reference-contexts: Sawasaki et al. [184] investigated tumbling as a manipulation primitive. During a tumbling operation, two robot fingers move in concert to cause the polyhedral object to rotate about an edge of the object in contact with the floor. Aiyama et al. <ref> [5] </ref> proposed a similar pivoting operation, where the object is rotated about a vertex in contact with the floor. During both of these operations, the floor acts as an extra finger.

Reference-contexts: We have applied results of this thesis to develop a simple planar parts feeding system, dubbed "1JOC" (one-joint-over-conveyor, pronounced "one jock") (Akella et al. <ref> [6] </ref>). Using a single joint manipulator positioned over a conveyor, the 1JOC can bring any polygonal part from a random initial configuration on the conveyor to a desired configuration by a series of pushes. <p> A discussion of the results is presented in Chapter 12. 1.5 Publication Note Much of Chapters 3-6 has previously appeared in (Lynch and Mason [132, 133]). Chapter 7 is joint work with Srinivas Akella, Wes Huang, and Matt Mason, and has previously appeared in <ref> [6] </ref>. 20 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION Chapter 2 Definitions The problems dealt with in this thesis are planar. The configuration space of the object is C = SE (2) = R 2 fi S 1 . <p> along the conveyor, the fence positions and orients a part and directs it into the entry point of a feeder track which carries the part to the next station. 1 This chapter is joint work with Srinivas Akella, Wes Huang, and Matt Mason, and previously appeared in (Akella et al. <ref> [6] </ref>). 69 70 CHAPTER 7.

Reference-contexts: Peshkin and Sanderson [163], and later Brokowski et al. [40], considered a similar problem, where the part is carried on a conveyor belt and reoriented by interactions with fences suspended above the belt. Akella and Mason <ref> [7] </ref> showed how to use a sequence of linear pushes with a fence to move a polygonal object from any initial configuration to any goal configuration.

Reference-contexts: A version of this problem was studied by Wilfong [218], who described an algorithm for a convex polygon translating among obstacles and pushing another convex polygon at edge contacts, without considering pushing direction constraints. In the terminology of Alami et al. <ref> [8] </ref>, a path between pushing contacts is a transit path, and a pushing path is called a transfer path. They described an approach to planning both the transit and transfer paths using manipulation graphs.

Reference-contexts: When the support distribution of the object is known, the limit surface of Goyal et al. [84, 85] is a convenient geometric interpretation of the relationship between support friction forces and slider motions. Alexander and Maddocks <ref> [9] </ref> considered the other extreme, when only the geometric extent of the support area is known, and described techniques to bound the possible motions of a pushed object. A comparison of the quasistatic and dynamic initial motions of a pushed object was given by Pham et al. [165]. <p> The actual motion is given by the contact mode that is consistent with all kinematic and force constraints. Peshkin and Sanderson [162] and Alexander and Maddocks <ref> [9] </ref> derived similar search procedures that find the slider motion by minimizing the power loss due to frictional sliding. Peshkin and Sanderson [164] proved that the power minimization approach is equivalent to the force/torque balance approach. In general, the support friction distribution s (x) is indeterminate. <p> In general, the support friction distribution s (x) is indeterminate. For this reason, several authors have investigated the use of weaker models of the support friction distribution (Mason [139]; Mason and Brost [142]; Peshkin and Sanderson [162]; Alexander and Maddocks <ref> [9] </ref>). With these weaker models, it is usually impossible to find the exact motion of the slider (see Appendix A). <p> For an applied force at an edge of the friction cone, the resulting rotation center must lie in its respective band (Mason and Brost [142]; Alexander and Maddocks <ref> [9] </ref>). Counterclockwise (respectively clockwise) rotation centers between the two bands and to the left (resp. right) of the slider correspond to force angles inside the angular limits of the friction cone. <p> Building on this work, Mason and Brost [142] and Peshkin and Sanderson [162] studied case (1.b), and Goyal et al. [84] investigated case (1.c). Alexander and Maddocks <ref> [9] </ref> argue that cases 1 Note that this is not equivalent to an infinite friction contact, because there may be slip even if the friction coefficient is infinite (Lynch and Mason [132]). 171 172 APPENDIX A.

Reference-contexts: The problem of batting a planar polygon to a desired stable orientation was addressed by Zumel and Erdmann [229]. Schaal et al. [186, 185] used batting in their "devil sticking" robot. Andersson <ref> [10] </ref> built a machine to play ping-pong, which is an adversarial form of batting. Striking an object sitting on a frictional planar surface can be used for micropositioning parts with an accuracy greater than the robot's positioning accuracy (Higuchi [91]; Huang et al. [96]).

Reference-contexts: Dynamic Nonprehensile Manipulation Koditschek [107] provides a thoughtful review of seminal works in the area of dynamic manipulation. Some examples of dynamic nonprehensile manipulation are discussed below. Parts Reorienting In research closely related to the work described in Part II, Arai and Khatib <ref> [11] </ref> used dynamic forces to roll a cube sitting on a paddle held by a PUMA robot arm. The paddle has three degrees of motion freedom in the vertical plane.

Reference-contexts: dynamic coupling includes controlling an inverted pendulum (Higdon and Cannon [90]); controlling the swinging motion of a high-bar robot (Takashima [209]) or the Acrobot (Hauser and Murray [87]; Spong [198]); the control of running and hopping robots (Berkemeier and Fearing [24]); and a series of papers by Arai et al. <ref> [13, 12, 14] </ref> (and related work by Bergerman et al.

[23]) using dynamic coupling with an actuated joint. This is similar to controlling rolling motion of an object. Straightforward application of active feedback is difficult, however, since the object is usually not instrumented to provide angular feedback.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, I use a feedback loop around the feedforward control to provide small corrections. B.7. RESULTS 187 Figure B.8: The test trajectory, shown as acceleration. I am also interested in learning control (Arimoto <ref> [15] </ref>), so trajectory following improves with practice. I have implemented two simple learning rules. The first is to simply add the PD feedback used during the run to the feedforward control of the next run. The second is a learning rule described by Atkeson [16].

Reference-contexts: One iteration of "learning control" is applied to the results of the previous run to generate a new feedforward control that compensates for unmodeled effects. We use an algorithm due to Atkeson <ref> [16] </ref> (see Appendix B). 4. The feedforward control is now fixed for all time, and future runs use this feedforward control along with PD feedback. <p> I have implemented two simple learning rules. The first is to simply add the PD feedback used during the run to the feedforward control of the next run. The second is a learning rule described by Atkeson <ref> [16] </ref>. The estimated torque command error at each timestep is given by ~t err = ~t ((; _ ; ) measured ) ~t ((; _ ; ) desired ); where ~t (; _ ; ) is the torque necessary using the model of the arm.

Reference-contexts: Brost [43] demonstrated linear pushing motions which result in a goal pusher/object equilibrium configuration by integrating the object's motion on the configuration space obstacle defined by the shapes of the pusher and the object. This is like "catching" the object by pushing it. Balorda <ref> [17, 18] </ref> has investigated catching by pushing with two points of contact. Mason [140] showed how to synthesize robot pushing motions to slide a block along a wall.

Reference-contexts: Coulomb friction is an approximate model of a complex and poorly understood physical process. It is well known that rigid-body mechanics with Coulomb friction gives rise to inconsistencies and ambiguities (Baraff <ref> [19] </ref>, Dupont [67], Erdmann [68, 69, 70], Lotstedt [126], Lynch and Mason [132], Trinkle et al. [211], Wang et al. [215]). To overcome this difficulty, compliant contact models have been suggested (Sinha [193]; Wang et al. [215]). <p> Despite the relative simplicity of the contact model, Baraff <ref> [19] </ref> showed that finding the motion of a rigid object in frictional contact may require time exponential in the number of contacts. 1.3. RELATED RESEARCH 11 1.3.2 Nonprehensile Manipulation Many different forms of nonprehensile manipulation have been studied. Of these, pushing has received the most attention.

This result has also been used in planning paths among obstacles (Laumond et al. [119]). The pushing planner presented in Chapter 6 is an adaptation of an algorithm by Barraquand and Latombe <ref> [21] </ref> for planning the motion of a car-like mobile robot. 1.3.5 Optimal Trajectory Planning The problem of finding open-loop controls of nonholonomically constrained systems is related to the optimal trajectory planning problem for fully actuated systems. To increase productivity, much work has focused on time-optimal trajectory planning. <p> Planning. Pushing paths consist of sequences of stable pushes, and the space of stable pushing directions imposes nonholonomic constraints on the motion of the object. I draw on work on path planning for nonholonomic mobile robots by Barraquand and Latombe <ref> [21] </ref> to construct a planner to find stable pushing paths among obstacles. 3.1 Assumptions 1. All pushing forces lie in the horizontal support plane, and gravity acts along the vertical. 2. The pusher and slider move in the horizontal plane. 3. Friction properties are uniform over the support plane. 3.2. <p> Here we note that any control system that is accessible must also be smalltime accessible. Thus the conditions of Proposition 4.1 are also necessary and sufficient for accessibility. Proposition 4.1 is a straightforward generalization of a result due to Barraquand and Latombe <ref> [21] </ref> that states that the Lie Algebra Rank Condition is satisfied for any car-like mobile robot that can take at least two steering angles. A car-like mobile robot can drive both forward and backward, and this symmetry, coupled with small-time accessibility, implies small-time local controllability. <p> Proof: Proposition 5 in Appendix B of (Barraquand and Latombe <ref> [21] </ref>) proves the case when ^ V consists of two velocity directions. <p> Despite this, Laumond [116] showed that a car-like robot that can reverse can reach any configuration in any open connected subset of its free configuration space. Barraquand and Latombe <ref> [21] </ref> showed that only two steering directions are required. Many path planners for car-like mobile robots have been proposed; see Chapter 9 of (Latombe [115]) for a survey.

For each pushing contact i = 1; : : : ; m, we calculate the set of stable pushing directions using the procedure Stable. <p> This is particularly an issue when there are many pushing edges and extremal controls. 6.3 Properties of the Planner The push planner inherits properties of the planner described by Barraquand and Latombe <ref> [21] </ref>.

For an n-joint robot, x = (x 1 x 2 : : : x n ), where x i is the vector of knot points for the cubic B-spline position history of joint i.

During nonprehensile manipulation, the object can be considered a link connected to the manipulator by a three (planar) or six (spatial) degree-of-freedom unactuated joint. As shown by Oriolo and Nakamura [159], unactuated joints typically result in nonintegrable second-order constraints.

Reference-contexts: Vukobratovic and Kircanski [212] split the trajectory into short segments and solved for the actuator effort during each segment using dynamic programming. This permits a nonuniform time-scaling of the trajectory, but it is also much more computationally intensive than Hollerbach's approach. Shin and McKay [191] and Bobrow et al. <ref> [30] </ref> independently derived similar, and much more efficient, algorithms for determining the time-optimal manipulator trajectory along a given path. The algorithms consider full arm dynamics and actuator torque limits. A computational improvement to the algorithm was reported by Slotine and Yang [195]. <p> For point-to-point control where the path is unimportant, however, the question remains of how to find both the both the optimal path and its time-scaling. Rajan [169] addressed this problem by first using a simple spline path between the start and goal points. The algorithm of Bobrow et al. <ref> [30] </ref> is used to find the time necessary for that path. Then the path representation is refined by adding another knot point, and the knots are locally varied to find the local minimum-time path. This process is repeated until path refinements yield little improvement.

Reference-contexts: NONPREHENSILE MANIPULATION 3 1.1.1 Applications of Nonprehensile Manipulation This section lists some applications of nonprehensile manipulation, to motivate the problems studied in this thesis. Parts feeding. Nonprehensile manipulation is particularly suited for parts feeding for automated assembly. The vibratory bowl feeder (Boothroyd et al. <ref> [35] </ref>) and the SONY APOS (Advanced Parts Orienting System) (Hitakawa [92]) are two successful systems that use dynamic nonprehensile manipulation. In both cases, a vibratory motion is combined with specially-shaped fixtures to either bring parts to a desired orientation, or reject them and send them back to be reprocessed. <p> Part II of this thesis addresses the problem of planning such trajectories automatically, explicitly considering friction constraints and manipulator kinematic and dynamic constraints, especially for low-degree-of-freedom manipulators. Parts Feeding The SONY APOS parts feeder (Hitakawa [92]) and the bowl feeder (Boothroyd et al. <ref> [35] </ref>) are examples of dynamic nonprehensile manipulation that have been successfully applied in industry. The design of these systems is primarily based on experience and trial-and-error, but recent work on the design of bowl feeders is aimed at partially automating the process (Boothroyd [34]; Caine [48]; Christiansen et al.

Reference-contexts: The Lie Algebra Rank Condition, an important nonlinear analog to the Kalman controllability rank condition of linear control theory, 1.3. RELATED RESEARCH 15 and its implications are discussed by Brockett <ref> [38] </ref>, Haynes and Hermes [88], Hermann and Krener [89], Jurdjevic [102], Sussmann and Jurdjevic [206], and Sussmann [204, 202]. Although there is no general necessary and sufficient condition for the controllability of nonlinear systems, Sussmann [205] derived a general sufficient condition for small-time local controllability. <p> As we have already noted, the pushing control system may not be symmetric, so small-time local controllability does not follow from small-time accessibility. For some systems, however, accessibility may imply controllability even when the system is not small-time locally controllable (Jurdjevic [102]; Jurdjevic and Sussmann [103]; Brockett <ref> [38] </ref>; Sussmann [204]; Crouch [58]). Consider the task of setting the minute-hand of a watch if it can only be rotated in a clockwise direction. The configuration of the minute-hand is not small-time locally controllable, but the topology of its configuration manifold S 1 renders the minute-hand's configuration controllable.

Reference-contexts: Although there is no general necessary and sufficient condition for the controllability of nonlinear systems, Sussmann [205] derived a general sufficient condition for small-time local controllability. Even if a nonholonomic system is fully controllable, however, Brockett <ref> [39] </ref> showed that it may not be stabilizable to a single equilibrium point using smooth state feedback. This suggests the use of algorithmic or nonsmooth control. <p> A simplified model of the snakeboard has been studied by Ostrowski et al. [161, 160]. A key feature of underactuated systems is the inability to independently drive all state variables to their desired values using smooth state feedback (Brockett <ref> [39] </ref>). Thus we need some sort of switching feedback law or open-loop control to reach the goal. Strategies for generating open-loop controls for nonholonomically constrained systems have been proposed by Murray and Sastry [155], Lafferiere and Sussmann [113], Sussmann [202], Sontag [196], and Leonard and Krishnaprasad [121]. <p> In my experiments, I was guided by intuition. Uncertainty Because of the nonholonomic nature of the manipulator/object system, there is no smooth feedback control law that will take the system to the goal state (Brockett <ref> [39] </ref>). For this reason, this thesis has studied open-loop controls. A serious limitation of the open-loop approach presented here is that there is no robustness to uncertainties and errors during the execution.

Reference-contexts: Extensions to the six-dimensional force-torque space of spatial objects are also discussed.

Reference-contexts: Throwing a club using a dynamic grasp was previously reported by Mason and Lynch [143, 144]. Batting Batting combines catching and throwing into a single collision. Robot juggling by batting has been demonstrated for one or two pucks with a planar juggler (Buhler and Koditschek <ref> [46] </ref>), a ball in space (Aboaf et al.

Reference-contexts: Velocity-matching and the shape of the cup make the catch robust. Slotine's catching robot uses visual data to estimate the flight of a ball, matches the trajectory of the end-effector to that of the ball, and then grabs it [194]. Burridge et al. <ref> [47] </ref> described three different "mirror laws" for controlled juggling, catching, and palming a ball with a planar paddle. By switching control laws from juggling to catching to palming, the robot transitions from juggling the ball to balancing it on the paddle.

Reference-contexts: Grid-based algorithms are presented for finding provably-nearly-time-optimal trajectories in obstacle fields for robots with coupled and decoupled dynamics.

Canny et al. <ref> [49] </ref> also proposed an exact algorithm for finding the time-optimal trajectory for a point mass with decoupled dynamics in the obstacle-free plane. All of these kinodynamic algorithms suffer from high computational complexity (Xavier [220]). Optimal control with objective functions other than time has also been considered.

Reference-contexts: The amount of computation is lessened by pruning the possible paths according to upper bounds on the estimated trajectory time. A very different approach was taken in a series of papers on kinodynamic planning (Canny et al. <ref> [50] </ref>, Donald and Xavier [63, 64]).

Reference-contexts: The design of these systems is primarily based on experience and trial-and-error, but recent work on the design of bowl feeders is aimed at partially automating the process (Boothroyd [34]; Caine [48]; Christiansen et al. <ref> [55] </ref>). Singer and Seering [192], Bohringer et al. [32], and Swanson et al. [207] studied related, simplified problems of using a vibrating planar support surface to bring parts to a desired configuration. Catching In catching, impact is inevitable.

Reference-contexts: In this research, I assume friction conforms to Coulomb's law (Coulomb <ref> [57] </ref>). The friction cone (Moseley [152]) is a useful geometric interpretation of Coulomb's law. Erdmann [68, 71] generalized the idea of the friction cone by including torques in the representation. <p> The set of available contact points on the object is a closed, piecewise smooth curve , which typically forms the perimeter of the object. Friction is assumed to conform to Coulomb's law (Coulomb <ref> [57] </ref>). The force applied at a frictional contact must satisfy the inequality jf t j f n , where f t is the tangential frictional component, f n is the normal component, and is the coefficient of friction.

Reference-contexts: There are many other nonholonomic systems of interest, including underwater vehicles and space robots; see (Bloch et al. [29]; Latombe [115]; Murray et al. [154]) for references. We note that dynamic nonprehensile manipulation is similar to controlling the attitude of a satellite (Crouch <ref> [58] </ref>), except the "jets" are unilateral frictional contacts. Motion Planning for Mobile Robots Particularly relevant to our work on planning pushing paths is path planning for car-like mobile robots, which move in an R 2 fi S 1 configuration space and share similar motion constraints. <p> For some systems, however, accessibility may imply controllability even when the system is not small-time locally controllable (Jurdjevic [102]; Jurdjevic and Sussmann [103]; Brockett [38]; Sussmann [204]; Crouch <ref> [58] </ref>). Consider the task of setting the minute-hand of a watch if it can only be rotated in a clockwise direction. The configuration of the minute-hand is not small-time locally controllable, but the topology of its configuration manifold S 1 renders the minute-hand's configuration controllable.

Reference-contexts: In their problem, the robot and the manipulated object translate in a planar workspace with obstacles, and the robot can grasp the object at a discrete set of locations and place the object at a discrete set of configurations. The planner of Dacre-Wright et al. <ref> [59] </ref> addresses the case of a convex planar robot and object where the robot can grasp the object at any contact.

Reference-contexts: A computational improvement to the algorithm was reported by Slotine and Yang [195]. Tan and Potts [210] described a time-optimal trajectory planner for a robot modeled using discrete dynamics and considering velocity, torque, and jerk constraints. De Luca et al. <ref> [60] </ref> used sequential quadratic programming to find the timing of knot points in a spline representation of the path. (Other objective functions are also possible.)

Reference-contexts: Thus we need some sort of switching feedback law or open-loop control to reach the goal.

Reference-contexts: In the future, warehouses will be maintained by robots, and pushing will be a useful capability for these robots. Throwing can be a useful method for transferring parts and tools between robots with disjoint kinematic workspaces. According to Marvin Minsky (Dodd and Rossol <ref> [62] </ref>): It seems to me that assembly lines are silly and when we have good hand-eye robots, they will usually throw the part across the factory to the machine that wants it and that machine will catch it.

Reference-contexts: Jacobs and Canny [99] constructed a motion planner for finding paths among obstacles for a mobile robot which does not reverse.

Reference-contexts: The task-level pick-and-place planning system HANDEY is described by Lozano-Perez et al. [127, 128]. Grasps are designed to make carrying the object to the goal configuration feasible in the presence of obstacles. An introduction to motion planning with grasp constraints is given by Latombe <ref> [115] </ref>. 1.3.4 Motion Planning and Control of Underactuated Systems Results from nonlinear control theory are useful in characterizing the controllability of nonholonomically constrained robot systems. <p> This suggests the use of algorithmic or nonsmooth control. An introduction to nonholonomic motion planning and the use of nonlinear control theory in robotics is given in the texts by Latombe <ref> [115] </ref>, Murray et al. [154], and Li and Canny [124]. The structure of mechanical control systems is used by Bloch et al. [28, 29] and Lewis and Murray [122] to derive controllability results. <p> An important characteristic of the trajectory planning problem for dynamic nonprehensile manipulation is the inequality constraints imposed by unilateral frictional contact. There are many other nonholonomic systems of interest, including underwater vehicles and space robots; see (Bloch et al. [29]; Latombe <ref> [115] </ref>; Murray et al. [154]) for references. We note that dynamic nonprehensile manipulation is similar to controlling the attitude of a satellite (Crouch [58]), except the "jets" are unilateral frictional contacts. <p> Controllability results and motion planners for this class of robots, and mobile robots pulling trailers, have been reported by Fortune and Wilfong [79], Barraquand and Latombe [20, 21], Latombe <ref> [114, 115] </ref>, Laumond [116, 117, 118], and Laumond et al. [119]. Jacobs and Canny [99] constructed a motion planner for finding paths among obstacles for a mobile robot which does not reverse. <p> Barraquand and Latombe [21] showed that only two steering directions are required. Many path planners for car-like mobile robots have been proposed; see Chapter 9 of (Latombe <ref> [115] </ref>) for a survey. For planning pushing paths, I chose to adapt an algorithm by Barraquand and Latombe [21] due to its simplicity and its adaptability to two-dimensional velocity direction sets. The resulting algorithm closely parallels that described by Barraquand and Latombe. <p> by Koditschek [108] and Rimon and Koditschek [174], which are guaranteed to be almost globally convergent based on prior knowledge of the topology of the space.) Randomly changing the iterate in the optimization is similar to the random jumps used to escape potential field minima in randomized path planning (Latombe <ref> [115] </ref>). Objective function Recognizing that friction between the arm and the object is limited and possibly varying, I chose to minimize the required friction for most of the examples. 165 166 CHAPTER 12.

RELATED RESEARCH 17 which include reversals. This result has also been used in planning paths among obstacles (Laumond et al. <ref> [119] </ref>). <p> An even better solution is to define this preimage as the goal region. Another approach is to find an exact holonomic path and transform it into one that obeys the nonholonomic constraints (Laumond et al. <ref> [119] </ref>). The examples presented in Section 6.4 use stable translational velocity directions that border on being unstable. These pushing paths may be made robust to bounded uncertainty in the pushing friction coefficient and the location of the center of friction by propagating this uncertainty through the procedure Stable. <p> Reeds and Shepp [173] enumerated a set of canonical paths, guaranteed to include the shortest path in the obstacle-free plane, for a car-like mobile robot that can reverse. This result has also been used in planning paths among obstacles (Laumond et al. <ref> [119] </ref>). As far as I am aware, there have been no similar results for more general sets of velocity directions. I have assumed that the set of possible pushing contacts is specified by the user.

Reference-contexts: This is a key result, as the precise support distribution is usually indeterminate. Peshkin and Sanderson [162] followed this work by finding bounds on the velocity direction of an object pushed at a point contact, and these results were used by Lynch <ref> [129] </ref> to find stable pushing motions for line contact. When the support distribution of the object is known, the limit surface of Goyal et al. [84, 85] is a convenient geometric interpretation of the relationship between support friction forces and slider motions. <p> The contact mode describes the qualitative behavior of each contact point between the pusher and the slider. For each possible contact mode i, there is a space of possible slider velocities V k;i that are kinematically consistent with that contact mode and the known pusher velocity (Lynch <ref> [129] </ref>). By Coulomb's law, each contact mode also specifies a polyhedral cone of possible pushing forces in the three-dimensional force space. This cone is the convex hull of the individual friction cones at the sticking contacts and the friction cone edges at the sliding contacts (Erdmann [68, 71]). <p> Instead, I assume that the center of friction and the shape of the slider are known. An algorithm for finding an approximation to ^ V F for a slider with a known center of friction was presented in (Lynch <ref> [129] </ref>). This algorithm utilizes results due to Peshkin and Sanderson [162] on the possible support friction distributions of a disk slider. Here I describe the much simpler procedure Stable for finding a conservative approximation to ^ V F . I will illustrate the procedure using rotation centers. <p> In general, however, the force cone F " does not fit the special structure assumed by Stable, so a more general algorithm, such as that described in (Lynch <ref> [129] </ref>), must be used. In principle we can do better if we know the relative magnitude of the support friction of S 1 and S 2 . <p> I have focused on line contact pushing, but a similar approach can be used with other types of pushing contacts, particularly using the algorithm of (Lynch <ref> [129] </ref>). To manipulate an unknown object, a robot could estimate the friction parameters of the object (Yoshikawa and Kurisu [224]; Lynch [130]), perform the mechanics analysis, and use the results in the planner described here. <p> Thus the circle criterion of Proposition 4 is explained simply using force-moment balance and the pc-circle. The point ~c of the circle C is equivalent to the "effective center of friction" (Lynch <ref> [129] </ref>). In other words, for the COR c, the bipod distribution acts like a single point at ~c: the total support frictional force acts through ~c in a direction opposite its motion.

By careful modeling of frictional and dynamic forces during pushing, Jia and Erdmann [101] demonstrated that it is possible to determine the configuration of a known object from tactile data during a blind, open-loop push. <p> I have focused on line contact pushing, but a similar approach can be used with other types of pushing contacts, particularly using the algorithm of (Lynch [129]). To manipulate an unknown object, a robot could estimate the friction parameters of the object (Yoshikawa and Kurisu [224]; Lynch <ref> [130] </ref>), perform the mechanics analysis, and use the results in the planner described here. Alternatively, the robot could empirically determine a set of stable pushing directions and plug these directly into the planner.

Reference-contexts: Coulomb friction is an approximate model of a complex and poorly understood physical process. It is well known that rigid-body mechanics with Coulomb friction gives rise to inconsistencies and ambiguities (Baraff [19], Dupont [67], Erdmann [68, 69, 70], Lotstedt [126], Lynch and Mason <ref> [132] </ref>, Trinkle et al. [211], Wang et al. [215]). To overcome this difficulty, compliant contact models have been suggested (Sinha [193]; Wang et al. [215]). Alternatively, the friction law could be modified; the field of tribology (Bowden and Tabor [36]) is concerned with finding more accurate descriptions of friction. <p> Simulation and experimental results are given in Chapter 11. A discussion of the results is presented in Chapter 12. 1.5 Publication Note Much of Chapters 3-6 has previously appeared in (Lynch and Mason <ref> [132, 133] </ref>).

INTRODUCTION Chapter 2 Definitions The problems dealt with in this thesis are planar. <p> Despite the notation, each joint can be either prismatic or revolute. Chapter 9 Controllability of Dynamic Manipulation This chapter examines the controllability of dynamic nonprehensile manipulation. I begin by developing a geometric interpretation of the mapping from applied forces to accelerations of the object, taken from (Lynch and Mason <ref> [132] </ref>). This geometric interpretation is simply to aid the intuition, and is analogous to the limit surface of Part I. A key difference is that the limit surface has no closed-form representation, and there is no closed-form solution to the motion of a pushed object. <p> Alexander and Maddocks [9] argue that cases 1 Note that this is not equivalent to an infinite friction contact, because there may be slip even if the friction coefficient is infinite (Lynch and Mason <ref> [132] </ref>). 171 172 APPENDIX A. PUSHING WITH POINT CONTACT (1.b) and (1.c) require information that may not be available or assumptions that may not be met. They present new results for cases (1.a, 2.b.i) and (1.a, 2.b.iii), which require only a geometric model of the possible support region.

Reference-contexts: Of these, pushing has received the most attention. Pushing Mason identified pushing as an important manipulation process for manipulating several objects at once, for reducing uncertainty in part orientation, and as a precursor to grasping. Building on early work by Prescott [167] and MacMillan <ref> [134] </ref> on determining the support friction forces and torques during general sliding motion, Mason [139, 145] derived perhaps the first useful result for planning pushing operations. <p> the plane, and a slider frame F S with origin O S is attached to the center of friction of the slider S. (For a uniform coefficient of support friction, the center of friction of the slider is the point in the support plane beneath the center of mass (MacMillan <ref> [134] </ref>).) The configuration q = (x w ; y w ; w ) T describes the position and orientation of the slider frame F S relative to the world frame F W .

During nonprehensile manipulation, the object can be considered a link connected to the manipulator by a three (planar) or six (spatial) degree-of-freedom unactuated joint. As shown by Oriolo and Nakamura [159], unactuated joints typically result in nonintegrable second-order constraints.

Mason <ref> [139] </ref> developed search procedures to find the slider motion resulting in force/torque balance (for a known support friction distribution s (x)) for sticking and sliding contact. The actual motion is given by the contact mode that is consistent with all kinematic and force constraints. <p> Peshkin and Sanderson [164] proved that the power minimization approach is equivalent to the force/torque balance approach. In general, the support friction distribution s (x) is indeterminate. For this reason, several authors have investigated the use of weaker models of the support friction distribution (Mason <ref> [139] </ref>; Mason and Brost [142]; Peshkin and Sanderson [162]; Alexander and Maddocks [9]). With these weaker models, it is usually impossible to find the exact motion of the slider (see Appendix A). <p> Nonzero friction. iii. Perfectly rough (no slip). 1 To get useful results for robotic manipulation planning, this thesis uses a known center of friction for the pushed object. This appendix addresses techniques for bounding the motion of a pushed object when the center of friction is not known.

Building on this work, Mason and Brost [142] and Peshkin and Sanderson [162] studied case (1.b), and Goyal et al. [84] investigated case (1.c).

Reference-contexts: Erdmann showed how to use this generalized friction cone to compute the reaction forces and motions of an object in its configuration space. Extensions to the six-dimensional force-torque space of spatial objects are also discussed. Graphical methods for representing and combining planar frictional forces are described by Mason <ref> [141] </ref> and Brost and Mason [44]. Both of these methods ignore force magnitudes to render the force-torque space two-dimensional. The latter approach essentially projects Erdmann's generalized friction cones to the unit sphere in force-torque space.

Reference-contexts: In this thesis, I explore the last approach and study the capabilities of very simple robots endowed with good models of mechanics. Based on the underlying mechanics model, we can define a taxonomy of manipulation models (Mason and Lynch <ref> [143] </ref>): * Kinematic manipulation. Kinematics (motion without regard to forces) are considered. * Static manipulation. Kinematics and static forces (such as Coulomb static friction and gravity) are considered. * Quasistatic manipulation. Kinematics, static forces, and quasistatic forces, such as sliding friction, are considered. Inertial forces are negligible. * Dynamic manipulation. <p> Using the taxonomy of manipulation models, we can define the following types of grasps (Mason and Lynch <ref> [143] </ref>): * Kinematic grasp. All relative motion is prevented considering only kinematic constraints. This is a form closure grasp, often used in fixturing. * Static grasp. All relative motion is prevented considering only kinematic constraints and static forces, such as gravity and static friction. <p> Throwing Learning approaches have been applied to improve a robot's ability to throw (Aboaf et al. [2]; Schneider and Brown [188]). Throwing a club using a dynamic grasp was previously reported by Mason and Lynch <ref> [143, 144] </ref>. Batting Batting combines catching and throwing into a single collision.

Reference-contexts: Running Locomotion can be viewed as "self manipulation." Raibert [168] described a class of running machines that are dynamically stable. These machines can also perform gymnastic feats such as flips (Hodgins and Raibert [93]). McGeer <ref> [147] </ref> constructed a walking machine that is simplicity itself: there are no motors or sensors. The structure and mass parameters of the walker were chosen so walking down a slight incline is passively stable. A later version of the walker used knees to prevent toe-stubbing [148]. <p> The complexity of a system may be measured in terms of the sensors, effectors, computation, communication, etc., necessary to accomplish the task (Bohringer et al. [31]). This thesis explores minimal effector solutions to manipulation tasks. McGeer's walking machines <ref> [147, 148] </ref> are dramatic examples of minimalism; a stable walking gait is obtained without sensors, actuators, or computation. Another example is the tray-tilting system built by Erdmann and Mason [74], which can orient a part in a random configuration in the tray without sensing.

Reference-contexts: At each iteration, SQP determines the direction to step by solving a quadratic subprogram, where the objective function is a quadratic approximation at the current point and nonlinear constraints are linearized. The constrained nonlinear program can be written (More and Wright <ref> [151] </ref>) min f (x) subject to c i (x) 0; i 2 I c i (x) = 0; i 2 E where x 2 R n is the iterate, f is the objective function, each c i is a constraint mapping R n to R, and I and E are index <p> Most algorithms, including the one used in this work, use the BFGS update rule (or similar quasi-Newton update rule) to generate a positive definite approximation to the Hessian, which results in superlinear convergence (More and Wright <ref> [151] </ref>). A number of packages are available to solve SQP problems, including implementations in the NAG and IMSL libraries. The results reported in this thesis were obtained using CFSQP (C code for Feasible Sequential Quadratic Programming, Lawrence et al. [120]) using QLD (Schittkowski [187]) to solve each quadratic programming subproblem.

Reference-contexts: In this research, I assume friction conforms to Coulomb's law (Coulomb [57]). The friction cone (Moseley <ref> [152] </ref>) is a useful geometric interpretation of Coulomb's law. Erdmann [68, 71] generalized the idea of the friction cone by including torques in the representation. Thus a friction cone in the plane is represented as an infinite planar cone emanating from the origin of a three-dimensional force-torque space. <p> Most of the results presented here can be easily generalized to the case where kinetic friction is less than static friction.) 21 22 CHAPTER 2. DEFINITIONS The friction coefficient can be geometrically interpreted as a friction cone (generally credited to Moseley <ref> [152] </ref>). The cone consists of all forces passing through the contact point and making an angle less than or equal to tan 1 with the contact normal (Figure 2.2).

An introduction to nonholonomic motion planning and the use of nonlinear control theory in robotics is given in the texts by Latombe [115], Murray et al. <ref> [154] </ref>, and Li and Canny [124]. The structure of mechanical control systems is used by Bloch et al.

There are many other nonholonomic systems of interest, including underwater vehicles and space robots; see (Bloch et al. [29]; Latombe [115]; Murray et al. <ref> [154] </ref>) for references. We note that dynamic nonprehensile manipulation is similar to controlling the attitude of a satellite (Crouch [58]), except the "jets" are unilateral frictional contacts. <p> This section reviews some basic facts necessary to apply results from nonlinear control theory, and is intended to aid the reader who is unfamiliar with differential geometry.

Reference-contexts: By shifting his or her weight, the rider produces motion of the snakeboard through rolling of the wheels. A simplified model of the snakeboard has been studied by Ostrowski et al. <ref> [161, 160] </ref>. A key feature of underactuated systems is the inability to independently drive all state variables to their desired values using smooth state feedback (Brockett [39]). Thus we need some sort of switching feedback law or open-loop control to reach the goal.

Reference-contexts: He discovered a simple rule for determining the rotation sense of a pushed object that depends on the center of friction of the object, not its precise support distribution. This is a key result, as the precise support distribution is usually indeterminate. Peshkin and Sanderson <ref> [162] </ref> followed this work by finding bounds on the velocity direction of an object pushed at a point contact, and these results were used by Lynch [129] to find stable pushing motions for line contact. <p> Mason [139] developed search procedures to find the slider motion resulting in force/torque balance (for a known support friction distribution s (x)) for sticking and sliding contact. The actual motion is given by the contact mode that is consistent with all kinematic and force constraints. Peshkin and Sanderson <ref> [162] </ref> and Alexander and Maddocks [9] derived similar search procedures that find the slider motion by minimizing the power loss due to frictional sliding. Peshkin and Sanderson [164] proved that the power minimization approach is equivalent to the force/torque balance approach. <p> In general, the support friction distribution s (x) is indeterminate. For this reason, several authors have investigated the use of weaker models of the support friction distribution (Mason [139]; Mason and Brost [142]; Peshkin and Sanderson <ref> [162] </ref>; Alexander and Maddocks [9]). With these weaker models, it is usually impossible to find the exact motion of the slider (see Appendix A). <p> Instead, I assume that the center of friction and the shape of the slider are known. An algorithm for finding an approximation to ^ V F for a slider with a known center of friction was presented in (Lynch [129]). This algorithm utilizes results due to Peshkin and Sanderson <ref> [162] </ref> on the possible support friction distributions of a disk slider. Here I describe the much simpler procedure Stable for finding a conservative approximation to ^ V F . I will illustrate the procedure using rotation centers. Without loss of 5.3. <p> endpoint, where p is the distance from the endpoint to the center of friction and r is the distance from the center of friction to the most distant support point of the slider. (This "tip line" should actually be slightly more distant from the center of friction (Peshkin and Sanderson <ref> [162] </ref>).) The rotation center from a force through this endpoint must lie in the band between these two lines (Mason and Brost [142]). All rotation centers between the two bands correspond to forces that pass between the two endpoints. <p> Mason [139] studied several models for support and pushing friction, and he utilized theoretical results for case (1.b) to synthesize robot manipulation plans. Building on this work, Mason and Brost [142] and Peshkin and Sanderson <ref> [162] </ref> studied case (1.b), and Goyal et al. [84] investigated case (1.c).

Reference-contexts: Robot programming languages. Someday robot programming languages will include such primitives as "push" and "throw." Box pushing has become such a popular task for mobile robots that at least one mobile robot manufacturer is planning to include pushing simulation software with its simulation environment (Pignon <ref> [166] </ref>). 1.1.2 An Example Let's look at one example of nonprehensile manipulation: a nonprehensile "grasp." I will say that an object is "grasped" if it remains fixed to the manipulator as it moves.

Reference-contexts: Of these, pushing has received the most attention. Pushing Mason identified pushing as an important manipulation process for manipulating several objects at once, for reducing uncertainty in part orientation, and as a precursor to grasping. Building on early work by Prescott <ref> [167] </ref> and MacMillan [134] on determining the support friction forces and torques during general sliding motion, Mason [139, 145] derived perhaps the first useful result for planning pushing operations.

Reference-contexts: Striking an object sitting on a frictional planar surface can be used for micropositioning parts with an accuracy greater than the robot's positioning accuracy (Higuchi [91]; Huang et al. [96]). Running Locomotion can be viewed as "self manipulation." Raibert <ref> [168] </ref> described a class of running machines that are dynamically stable. These machines can also perform gymnastic feats such as flips (Hodgins and Raibert [93]). McGeer [147] constructed a walking machine that is simplicity itself: there are no motors or sensors.

Reference-contexts: For point-to-point control where the path is unimportant, however, the question remains of how to find both the both the optimal path and its time-scaling. Rajan <ref> [169] </ref> addressed this problem by first using a simple spline path between the start and goal points. The algorithm of Bobrow et al.

Reference-contexts: The latter approach essentially projects Erdmann's generalized friction cones to the unit sphere in force-torque space. These approaches are suited to problems where force magnitudes are not relevant to determining the direction of motion of an object. Rajan et al. <ref> [170] </ref> described an algebraic approach to determining the motion of a rigid planar object in frictional contact with walls. Coulomb friction is an approximate model of a complex and poorly understood physical process.

Reference-contexts: Jacobs and Canny [99] constructed a motion planner for finding paths among obstacles for a mobile robot which does not reverse. This planner uses a set of canonical shortest C 1 curves with a lower bound on the turning radius, due to Dubins [66].

Reference-contexts: In short, SQP as a motion planner suffers from the same local problems inherent to any potential field method. (Notable exceptions are the navigation functions constructed by Koditschek [108] and Rimon and Koditschek <ref> [174] </ref>, which are guaranteed to be almost globally convergent based on prior knowledge of the topology of the space.) Randomly changing the iterate in the optimization is similar to the random jumps used to escape potential field minima in randomized path planning (Latombe [115]).

The set of nonzero tangent vectors at q is denoted X (q). <p> Theorem 4.1 does not completely answer the question of small-time local controllability at q, however, as it does not address the case when 0 lies in @CH R 3 (X (q)). To resolve this case, we must consider the derivatives of X (q) (Sussmann <ref> [203] </ref>). If 0 lies in @CH R 3 (X (q)), then there is a unique linear subspace Z of maximum dimension such that 0 lies in the interior of @CH R 3 (X (q)) in this space Z. <p> The set of all vector fields [X; Y ] such that X; Y 2 X Z is denoted X 1 Z . Applying Sussmann's sufficient condition for small-time local controllability (Sussmann <ref> [203] </ref>), the control system is small-time locally controllable if the convex hull of X (q) and X 1 Z (q) contains 0 in its interior. For the control system , Sussmann's sufficient condition is also necessary.

Although there is no general necessary and sufficient condition for the controllability of nonlinear systems, Sussmann <ref> [205] </ref> derived a general sufficient condition for small-time local controllability. Even if a nonholonomic system is fully controllable, however, Brockett [39] showed that it may not be stabilizable to a single equilibrium point using smooth state feedback. This suggests the use of algorithmic or nonsmooth control. <p> One example is the class of symmetric systems, where all vector fields can be followed forward and backward. Although there are no known necessary and sufficient conditions for small-time local controllability for general nonlinear systems, Sussmann <ref> [205] </ref> derived a sufficient condition that generalizes many of the sufficient condtions in the literature. Controllability can be proven by "patching" together open sets of the state space where small-time local controllability holds. <p> The system satisfies the Lie Algebra Rank Condition. Now we give some definitions necessary to apply Sussmann's sufficient condition for smalltime local controllability <ref> [205] </ref>. For an element B 2 Br (X ), we define ffi i (B) as the number of times X i appears in B, and the degree of B is P n i=0 ffi i (B). <p> A "bad" bracket B is "neutralized" at a state p if B, evaluated at p, is the linear combination of "good" brackets of lower degree evaluated at p. Sussmann <ref> [205] </ref> proved that if a system satisfies the Lie Algebra Rank Condition at p and all "bad" brackets evaluated at p are neutralized, then the system is small-time locally controllable at p.

However, APOS provides an example of a simple type of assembly with nonprehensile manipulation|parts are "assembled" in the proper orientation in specially-shaped depressions of a vibrating pallet.

The space of all trajectories of the manipulator and object is, in theory, infinite-dimensional. In practice, we can only solve for finite-dimensional approximations to the 114 CHAPTER 10.

Reference-contexts: Canny et al. [49] also proposed an exact algorithm for finding the time-optimal trajectory for a point mass with decoupled dynamics in the obstacle-free plane. All of these kinodynamic algorithms suffer from high computational complexity (Xavier <ref> [220] </ref>). Optimal control with objective functions other than time has also been considered. Yen and Nagurka [221] represented robot trajectories as the sum of a fifth-order polynomial and a finite Fourier series and used nonlinear programming to solve for minimum-energy trajectories. <p> Kinodynamic planning is an example of the former. Kinodynamic planning has the advantage that solutions are guaranteed to be close to optimal. It suffers from high computational complexity, however, and I am not aware of any implementations for robots with more than two degrees-of-freedom (Xavier <ref> [220] </ref>). Iterative gradient-based approaches take advantage of smoothness to obtain directional information to guide the search for a solution. This information can potentially lead to relatively fast searching of high-dimensional spaces.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Yokoyama [158]; Lynch et al. [131]), and infrared ranging feedback (unpublished work by Latombe and colleagues <ref> [222] </ref>). Learning (Mahadevan and Connell [135]; Miura [150]; Salganicoff [181]; Zrimec [227]) and friction parameter estimation (Lynch [130]; Yoshikawa and Kurisu [224]) have also been proposed to improve control of pushing. <p> The pushing model provides the information necessary to derive the object's configuration from the tactile data. Box pushing seems to be a favorite task for mobile robots like Shakey (Fikes and Nilsson [78]) and his successors (Mahadevan and Connell [135]; Okawa and Yokoyama [158]; Latombe and colleagues <ref> [222] </ref>). Donald et al. [65] and Brown and Jennings [45] demonstrated controlled pushing using two cooperating mobile robots which communicate only through the motion of the sliding object. Mataric et al. [146] demonstrated box pushing by two walking robots coordinated by a simple set of behavioral rules. <p> point contact is inherently unstable, and many researchers have constructed point contact pushing control systems using visual (Inaba and Inoue [97]; Gandolfo et al. [80]; Salganicoff et al. [181]; Narasimhan [156]), tactile (Okawa and Yokoyama [158]; Lynch et al. [131]), and infrared ranging feedback (unpublished work by Latombe and colleagues <ref> [222] </ref>). Here I examine the controllability of such a system.

Reference-contexts: By switching control laws from juggling to catching to palming, the robot transitions from juggling the ball to balancing it on the paddle. Other work on catching focuses on designing the manipulator configuration and compliance to reduce impact forces for tasks such as capturing a satellite (Yoshikawa and Yamada <ref> [223] </ref>). Throwing Learning approaches have been applied to improve a robot's ability to throw (Aboaf et al. [2]; Schneider and Brown [188]). Throwing a club using a dynamic grasp was previously reported by Mason and Lynch [143, 144]. Batting Batting combines catching and throwing into a single collision.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Yokoyama [158]; Lynch et al. [131]), and infrared ranging feedback (unpublished work by Latombe and colleagues [222]). Learning (Mahadevan and Connell [135]; Miura [150]; Salganicoff [181]; Zrimec [227]) and friction parameter estimation (Lynch [130]; Yoshikawa and Kurisu <ref> [224] </ref>) have also been proposed to improve control of pushing. By careful modeling of frictional and dynamic forces during pushing, Jia and Erdmann [101] demonstrated that it is possible to determine the configuration of a known object from tactile data during a blind, open-loop push. <p> I have focused on line contact pushing, but a similar approach can be used with other types of pushing contacts, particularly using the algorithm of (Lynch [129]). To manipulate an unknown object, a robot could estimate the friction parameters of the object (Yoshikawa and Kurisu <ref> [224] </ref>; Lynch [130]), perform the mechanics analysis, and use the results in the planner described here. Alternatively, the robot could empirically determine a set of stable pushing directions and plug these directly into the planner.

Reference-contexts: of a high-bar robot (Takashima [209]) or the Acrobot (Hauser and Murray [87]; Spong [198]); the control of running and hopping robots (Berkemeier and Fearing [24]); and a series of papers by Arai et al. [13, 12, 14] (and related work by Bergerman et al. [23] and Yu et al. <ref> [225] </ref>) examining controllability and describing control algorithms for robots with some joints equipped only with brakes. Jain and Rodriguez [100] studied the kinematics and dynamics of underactuated manipulators and described an inverse dynamics algorithm. Other researchers have studied underactuated manipulation using kinematic coupling instead of dynamic coupling.

Reference-contexts: Chen [53] took a similar approach, representing the robot trajectory by uniform cubic B-splines and using sequential quadratic programming to handle linear and nonlinear equality and inequality constraints. Recently, Zefran and Kumar <ref> [226] </ref> proposed another method for handling inequality constraints in optimal control problems. In an effort to automatically produce physically realistic animation, Witkin and Kass [219] model a character's physical structure and find actuator programs that accomplish a goal while optimizing some function.

Reference-contexts: During both of these operations, the floor acts as an extra finger. Other examples of nonprehensile manipulation include rotating an object in a gravity field using two frictionless point contacts (Abell and Erdmann [1]); cooperative manipulation by two nonprehensile palms (Erdmann [72]; Zumel <ref> [228] </ref>); and various forms of whole-arm manipulation (Salisbury [182]; Salisbury et al. [183]). 1.3.3 Path Planning with Grasp Constraints To plan pushing paths, we must find (1) a sequence of robot pushing motions and (2) the robot's motion between pushes.
