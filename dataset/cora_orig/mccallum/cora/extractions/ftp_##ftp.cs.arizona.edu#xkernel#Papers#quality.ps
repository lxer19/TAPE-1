Abstract: In order to transfer digital images over computer networks, it is necessaryto encode the pixels that make up the image into a set of network packets. Because the network does not reliably deliver all the packets from the source to the destination, this encoding influencesthe quality of the image that is delivered to the end user. This paper explores the effects of various encoding algorithms on image quality in the presence of unreliable computer networks.

Reference-contexts: Like many other parts of an end-to-end system, the right recovery method is a function of required image quality and execution speed requirements. The user has a range of recovery options ordered by increasing accuracy and processing requirements <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. In some cases it is acceptable to do no recovery, or merely replace missing pixels with precomputed global averages. A variety of interpolation options are more expensive but yield better results. Finally, techniques like median or morphological filtering can be used effectively on certain classes of imagery.

Reference-contexts: To verify this intuition, this section reports on the performance of three image processing applications. First, consider a multispectral k-means classification algorithm, which is based on the standard isodata clustering algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>. In measuring the performance of this application, we ran the system on samples of 20m multispectral SPOT imagery of a complex urban area. Such areas are believed to provide a more difficult test for our encoding algorithms due to the highly variable nature of such scenes.

Reference-contexts: We have already described various encoding and recovery algorithms and quantified their effect on image transfer time in a companion paper <ref> [4] </ref>. This paper briefly summarizes that work, and then explores on the effect of various encoding algorithms on image quality. <p> A variety of interpolation options are more expensive but yield better results. Finally, techniques like median or morphological filtering can be used effectively on certain classes of imagery. The reader is referred to <ref> [4] </ref> for more details on recovery algorithms. 2.3 Encoding Algorithms The success of most recovery algorithms is determined by the amount of information available for recovery around each lost pixel. <p> We have tested our system on samples 1 The relationship between the encoding algorithms and data compression is discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>. from four different types of digital imagery, and report the average measurements for five sample images of each type: MSS: Landsat Multispectral Scanner. TM: Landsat Thematic Mapper. SPOT: French SPOT Satellite. EO: Underwater Electro-Optical Camera. <p> This is ultimately promising because it indicates a potential robustness to changes in encoding. This allows much more flexibility in the design of encoding and transmission algorithms. 4 Conclusions We demonstrate in a companion paper <ref> [4] </ref> that the end-to-end performance of an image transfer protocol can be improved by not retransmitting packets dropped by the network. To compensate for lost packets, we run various recovery algorithms on the transmitted images.
