Abstract: In 1992 and 1993, a series of experiments using the NetDyn tool was run at the University of Maryland to characterize network behavior. These studies identified multiple design and implementation faults in the Internet. Since that time, there has been a wide array of changes to the Internet. During the Spring of 1996, we conducted a replication of the NetDyn experiments in order to characterize end-to-end behavior in the current environment. In this paper, we present and discuss the latest results obtained during this study. Although the network seems to be stabilizing with respect to transit times, our current results are similar to the results from past experiments. That is, networks often exhibit unexpected behavior. The data suggest that while there has been improvement, there are still problem areas that need to be addressed. fl This work is supported in part by ONR and ARPA under contract N66001-95-C-8619 to the Computer Science Department at the University of Maryland.

Reference-contexts: This minimal packet size is used so that the experiments will not contribute significantly to network congestion, which might skew the results. Both the Source and Echo processes forward packets using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <ref> [1] </ref>. 1 UDP is a best-effort protocol which does not provide flow control or reliability checks such as detection of lost packets, in-order delivery, etc. The absence of quality of service guarantees allows us to study network behavior at the IP [2] level.

In this study, all of the hosts for the experiment were in one location (UC-Berkeley).
