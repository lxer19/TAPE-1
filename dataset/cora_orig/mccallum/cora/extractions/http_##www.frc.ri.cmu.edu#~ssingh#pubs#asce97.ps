Abstract: A recent trend towards greater automation of earthmoving machines, such as backhoes, loaders, and dozers, reects a larger movement in the construction industry to improve productivity, efficiency and safety. This document reviews related work in various disciplines drawn upon by researchers soil mechanics, computer graphics, kinematic and dynamical modeling, optimization, control and decision theory. A taxonomy is suggested into which various automated systems reported in the literature, can be classified.

Various indices are suggested based on the configuration of these machines and resistive forces can be roughly estimated by numerically integrating simple equations.

Reference-contexts: Bernold suggests methods that could be used to schedule a eet of excavators and haulage vehicles to perform the task of excavation most efficiently <ref> [Bernold 86] </ref>. 4.5 Other Systems Several other systems do not fit into the above classification. Whittaker et al. demonstrated a novel system that uncovered buried pipes using a vacuum tool mounted on a back-hoe arm [Whittaker 85].

Reference-contexts: The depth of a cut is adjusted so that the swept volume fills the bucket.

Saratas method selects a path in the ore pile consisting of straight lines such that the swept volume is equal to the capacity of the bucket.

Reference-contexts: The paper discusses the forces and how they vary during scooping. Bisse et al. have suggested an analysis to evaluate the sum of the forces and energy involved in making a wheel loader bucket follow an arbitrary trajectory in a muck pile <ref> [Bisse 95] </ref>. A necessary assumption in both the work of Hemami and Bisse is that the shape of the pile being excavated and the soil properties are known in advance. Malaguti has proposed an analysis of soil-tool interaction based on physical models [Malaguti 94].

For example, researchers at the University of Lancaster, England have developed an automated 15 excavator (LUCIE) that uses a rule based method to dig trenches <ref> [Seward 88, Seward 92, Bradley 93] </ref>. Digging is broken down into three phases penetrate, drag and empty.

Reference-contexts: At this point, the loader curls the bucket and moves to the dumping point. In a similar vein, Bullock demonstrated a simple scheme to deal with the stiffness of soil <ref> [Bullock 89, Bullock 92] </ref>. He instrumented a small, four degree-of-freedom manipulator arm with strain gauges on one of the limbs. These strain gauges were monitored while a scoop attached to the end of the manipulator was pushed through the soil along a prescribed path.

Reference-contexts: The planner operates purely on a geometric basis without consideration of the strength of the soil versus the forces that can be developed by the excavator. Similarly, although at a smaller scale, Bullock and Apte describe the generation of subgoals for an excavator <ref> [Bullock 90] </ref>. The task is essentially to decompose a target volume into smaller volumes that can be tackled by an excavator. Both works described above relied only on simulation studies, and hence the resolution of the subgoals generated by a strategic planner for excavation remains an open question.

Reference-contexts: Another example is in the remediation of waste sites where chemical and nuclear wastes are stored <ref> [Wohlford 90, Burks 92, Thomp-son 95] </ref>. The net effect is that the past decade has seen a groundswell of interest in automation of earthmoving, and the trend is accelerating. The cycle of operation for a fully autonomous machine is: sense, plan, and execute. <p> The authors describe the evolution and specification of a remotely controlled excavator that is specifically designed to function productively while its operator is located at a safe distance. Similarly, Burks et al. describe a modified tracked excavator that has been developed to deal with buried waste <ref> [Burks 92, Thompson 95] </ref>. Their tele-operated military vehicle is equipped with a backhoe and front loader for explosive ordnance disposal and general utility excavation. The system is operated from a hand controller at a remotely located, portable, base station.

Each cell in the terrain map is 5 cm square. 5 reports numerous radar systems aimed at satisfying short distance non-contact ranging needs <ref> [Everett 95] </ref>. The greatest concern with this modality is resolution. While down-range accuracy is generally high, the cross-track accuracy suffers due to the broad transmitted beams. Even with the broad beams, it is possible to do successful obstacle avoidance as described by League and Lay [League 95].

Reference-contexts: A contour of the rock pile is extracted from the images and candidate digging locations and directions that fill the bucket completely, are chosen. Feng et al. have performed simulation studies to plan the trajectory of an excavator <ref> [Feng 92] </ref>. They have proposed a method to select between parameterized digs. The authors also use a heuristic rule based system to deal with force overload at the bucket. 19 In a similar vein is work reported by Singh [Singh 95a] at Carnegie Mellon University.

Reference-contexts: The simplest systems are triggered by pre-set force thresholds. For example, Gocho et al. describe the automation of a wheel loader working in an asphalt plant <ref> [Gocho 92] </ref>. The wheel loader navigates by following buried underground wires between loading and dumping points. Loading is accomplished by dropping the bucket to the ground and driving into a pile of granular material until a threshold is reached in the hydraulic back-pressure.

Reference-contexts: Hemami and Daneshmand have developed a similar kinematic model for a front loader <ref> [Hemami 92a] </ref>. Since most excavator mechanisms are not directly driven at the joints, but rather are powered by hydraulic cylinders attached to the limbs of the machine, researchers have further developed the relationships between the joint angles and cylinder positions [Koivo 92, Hemami 92a, Takahashi 94b]. <p> Since most excavator mechanisms are not directly driven at the joints, but rather are powered by hydraulic cylinders attached to the limbs of the machine, researchers have further developed the relationships between the joint angles and cylinder positions <ref> [Koivo 92, Hemami 92a, Takahashi 94b] </ref>. The forward kinematic relationship is used mainly in visualization for humans and in forward simulations of the joint trajectories. On the other hand, given a desired pose of the bucket, the inverse relationship provides the joint angles necessary to achieve the pose. <p> The kinematic analysis can be carried further in order to relate velocities and forces at the bucket tip to velocities and forces experienced at the joints. Hemami and Daneshmand have suggested such an equivalent model for a wheel loader <ref> [Hemami 92a] </ref>. 3.2 Dynamical Mechanism Models While kinematic models employ a purely geometric basis, dynamical models try to capture considerations such as inertia, friction, and acceleration. The purpose of such models is to relate joint torques to the motion of the excavators limbs.

Accuracy +/- 5cm. scanning laser using a mapping system developed at Carnegie Mellon <ref> [Hoffman 92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, no results exist for this type of system. Hoffman and Simmons describe a simulation system that incorporates a geometric model of the excavator and terrain, a laser scanner model that provides 3-D terrain data and a communication layer that interfaces to external modules <ref> [Hoffman 94] </ref>. The simulator is designed such that it can completely mimic an excavator and on-board sensors and provides 21 a platform for testing task-level software and for verifying correctness of the system integration.

Reference-contexts: These methods represent the world as a two or three-dimensional grid of discrete elements. Iterative algorithms are applied to the grids until equilibrium is reached. For example, Homma et al. propose a volumetric model to simulate the settlement of soil <ref> [Homma 90] </ref>. Terrain is tessellated into a three dimensional grid and each cell is marked as 9 occupied/empty. At every step of the simulation, each grid cell is checked to see if the contents will stay unchanged, or move to another cell, using a few simple rules.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, other researchers have suggested active use of a robot to determine the nature of material the robot is to interact with <ref> [Homma 92] </ref>. For like reasons, Singh has proposed a method that learns to predict resistive forces based on force measurements during digging with a excavator backhoe bucket [Singh 95b].

Reference-contexts: When the strain measurement exceeded a preset threshold, the scoop was backed up and a scooping operation was performed. Huang and Bernold have extended this type of control to deal with very stiff inclusions such as rocks in the soil being excavated <ref> [Huang 93] </ref>. They use a scaled model of a backhoe that has been outfitted with a load cell between the bucket and the backhoe stick. An obstacle is indicated by a high reading on the load cell.

Reference-contexts: These systems use pressure sensors inside the cylinders to trigger joint motions based on preset thresholds. The thresholds are parameterized by a scalar that represents soil condition but are fixed otherwise. In the same vein is a controller proposed by Kakuzen et al. <ref> [Kakuzen 88] </ref>. They have developed a feedback and feed-forward controller for crowd control and level luffing of a crane.

Reference-contexts: Operations are conducted on a tele-operated machine noteworthy because it was designed solely to be controlled by a computer as opposed other automated machines that are retrofits of standard construction equipment. Kojima et al. have described a tele-operated backhoe used to dig deep foundations <ref> [Kojima 90] </ref>. The operator uses a video monitor while operating a master control mechanism. Nakano et al. have demonstrated a prototype controller for a backhoe excavator that allows an operation to control the bucket in cartesian coordinates, and, to perform slope control [Nakano 92].

Reference-contexts: A necessary assumption in both the work of Hemami and Bisse is that the shape of the pile being excavated and the soil properties are known in advance. Malaguti has proposed an analysis of soil-tool interaction based on physical models <ref> [Malaguti 94] </ref>. The resistive force is composed of the soil-cutting force, the soil-penetration force, and the filling force. These forces are described in an universal earthmoving equation that accounts for the soils friction and cohesion. Quasi-static and dynamic models of soil-tool interaction (impedance) are also described.

Reference-contexts: Since soil conditions can vary immensely, prediction of resistive forces will suffer in accuracy if nominal values for soil and soil-tool parameters are used. Estimating forces precisely requires experimentally determined values. Several instruments are available for this process in a laboratory setting <ref> [McKyes 85] </ref>, although in situ testing will obviously provide better results [Wroth 84]. Wadhwa recognized that a better prediction of resistive force might be obtained for a tillage tool when the soil parameters are estimated using a scaled version of the tool itself, rather than using other devices [Wadhwa 80].

Reference-contexts: Resolvers, like potentiometers produce a signal that is proportional to joint displacement. Mulligan et al. report a novel scheme to compute the joint displacements from images of an excavator linkage using geometric models of an excavator arm coupled with fast processing <ref> [Mulligan 89] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The operator uses a video monitor while operating a master control mechanism. Nakano et al. have demonstrated a prototype controller for a backhoe excavator that allows an operation to control the bucket in cartesian coordinates, and, to perform slope control <ref> [Nakano 92] </ref>. In this case, the controls are able to directly specify motion of the bucket rather than of the joints. Recognizing that force information plays an important role in the control of an excavator, some attention has been focused on force-reecting master-slave systems.

Reference-contexts: This method is slow simply because it is three dimensional and requires treatment of a large number of cells. Puhl has described a similar method that assumes that the elevation of terrain is a single-valued function, that is, there are no voids <ref> [Puhl 92] </ref>. This simplification allows a two dimensional treatment of the soil surface and is, hence, much faster (quadratic instead of cubic).

Recently, Rowe and Stentz, at Carnegie Mellon University, have described a method to parameterize the motion of an excavator during a bench loading cycle as shown in Figure 8 <ref> [Rowe 97] </ref>. In a typical excavation a loading machine digs material from a face and dumps the material in a truck, often with a throughput of hundreds of trucks per day. Hence even a few seconds saved in every loading cycle can result in significant improvement in productivity.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to some of the heuristic schemes discussed above, Salcudean et al. have proposed a position-based impedance controller for the motion an excavator backhoe during digging <ref> [Salcudean 97] </ref>. In this approach, the bucket is modeled as a position source and the contact force measured through pressure sensors in the cylinders is used to modify the trajectory. 4.3 Tactical Planning At the next level of autonomy, it is necessary to determine where to dig.

Reference-contexts: For example, the type of image shown above can be easily transformed into a topological map of the terrain such as shown in Figure 3. Sarata has also proposed using a scanning laser scanner to determine the shape of an ore pile <ref> [Sarata 93] </ref>. Laser ranging will likely become cheaper, more accurate and fastercommercial prototypes of laser scanners operating at 500 Hkz with millimeter accuracy are already avail-ablebut the main issue is whether such sensors can be made to operate in the dust, smoke, and precipitation commonly found at worksites. <p> The depth of a cut is adjusted so that the swept volume fills the bucket.

Reference-contexts: This simplification allows a two dimensional treatment of the soil surface and is, hence, much faster (quadratic instead of cubic). Figure 4 shows how a modified version of this method described in <ref> [Singh 95a] </ref> could be used to predict settlement of soil after removing a specified volume. While the method assumes instantaneous removal of soil, the results approximate the settlement seen after a bucket has removed soil along a trench, where the soil is homogenous, dry, and uncompacted. <p> They have proposed a method to select between parameterized digs. The authors also use a heuristic rule based system to deal with force overload at the bucket. 19 In a similar vein is work reported by Singh <ref> [Singh 95a] </ref> at Carnegie Mellon University. Excavation is posed as a problem of constrained optimization over the space of prototypical, one-step excavating plans. The system uses geometric and force constraints and an objective function (e.g. minimum torque) to produce digging plans.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, other researchers have suggested active use of a robot to determine the nature of material the robot is to interact with [Homma 92]. For like reasons, Singh has proposed a method that learns to predict resistive forces based on force measurements during digging with a excavator backhoe bucket <ref> [Singh 95b] </ref>. The model incorporates parameters motivated by the analysis due to Reece, but the parameters can be non linearly related to the output.

It suffices to say that many sensing modalities have been used, including GPS, inertial sensors, and reecting beacons <ref> [Wells 86, Smith 88] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Since most excavator mechanisms are not directly driven at the joints, but rather are powered by hydraulic cylinders attached to the limbs of the machine, researchers have further developed the relationships between the joint angles and cylinder positions <ref> [Koivo 92, Hemami 92a, Takahashi 94b] </ref>. The forward kinematic relationship is used mainly in visualization for humans and in forward simulations of the joint trajectories. On the other hand, given a desired pose of the bucket, the inverse relationship provides the joint angles necessary to achieve the pose.

Reference-contexts: Although these sensors have seen greater use on indoor robots, ultrasonic sensors have been used outdoors for tasks such as collision avoidance for autonomous vehicles [Langer 92]. They have also been proposed to measure terrain elevation as it is graded <ref> [Teach 93] </ref>. Placed behind the bulldozer blade, the sensors provide a continuous elevation survey and the resultant contour map is displayed to an operator in the vehicle. In contrast to active sensors that transmit energy into the world, passive ranging devices use available energy to calculate range.

Reference-contexts: Another body of work, in contrast, attempts to estimate cutting forces based on first principle mechanics. Motivated largely by the need to estimate the forces experienced by tools used to perform tillage, the seminal ideas in this work come from the civil engineer's load-bearing equations for foundations <ref> [Terzaghi 47] </ref>. These models were extended by several researchers who recognized the similarity to the case of a blade moving through soil [Reece 64, Siemens 65, Luth 65, Hettiaratchi 67, Gill 68]. These researchers have added provisions to account for a variety of tool geometries and orientations.

Similarly, Burks et al. describe a modified tracked excavator that has been developed to deal with buried waste <ref> [Burks 92, Thompson 95] </ref>. Their tele-operated military vehicle is equipped with a backhoe and front loader for explosive ordnance disposal and general utility excavation. The system is operated from a hand controller at a remotely located, portable, base station.

Reference-contexts: The inverse dynamic model offers greater utility. It provides a reference joint-torque trajectory given the desired end-effector motion. Vaha and Skibiniewski have proposed a model based on the Newton-Euler method of dynamical modeling for robot manipulators <ref> [Vaha 91b, Vaha 93a] </ref>. Lawrence et al. have also used a similar formulation to model an excavator backhoe modified for forestry applications [Lawrence 95].

Reference-contexts: Wadhwa recognized that a better prediction of resistive force might be obtained for a tillage tool when the soil parameters are estimated using a scaled version of the tool itself, rather than using other devices <ref> [Wadhwa 80] </ref>. Similarly, other researchers have suggested active use of a robot to determine the nature of material the robot is to interact with [Homma 92].

Reference-contexts: Another form of state estimation is to locate an earthmover with respect to some fixed coordinate frame. It suffices to say that many sensing modalities have been used, including GPS, inertial sensors, and reecting beacons <ref> [Wells 86, Smith 88] </ref>. Successful estimation schemes combine vehicle models with complementary sensing modalities. The other class of sensor perceives the machines immediate environment so that it can intelligently perform tasks such as avoiding obstacles or picking a place to dig.

Reference-contexts: Another example is in the remediation of waste sites where chemical and nuclear wastes are stored <ref> [Wohlford 90, Burks 92, Thomp-son 95] </ref>. The net effect is that the past decade has seen a groundswell of interest in automation of earthmoving, and the trend is accelerating.
