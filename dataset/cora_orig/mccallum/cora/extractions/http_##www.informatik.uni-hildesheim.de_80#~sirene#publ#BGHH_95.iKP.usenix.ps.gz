Abstract: This paper proposes a family of protocols iKP for secure electronic payments over the Internet. The protocols implement credit card-based transactions between the customer and the merchant while using the existing financial network for clearing and authorization. The protocols can be extended to apply to other payment models, such as debit cards and electronic checks. They are based on public-key cryptography and can be implemented in either software or hardware. Individual protocols differ in key management complexity and degree of security. It is intended that their deployment be gradual and incremental.

Reference-contexts: While 1KP is very simple, it does not offer non-repudiation for messages sent by customers and merchants; this means that disputes about the authenticity of payment orders are not easily resolvable. Some consequences of missing non-repudiation for payment systems are illustrated in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2KP improves on 1KP by providing also merchants, in addition to gateways, with public key-pairs and public key certificates. As a result, non-repudiation is provided for messages originated by merchants. <p> E i invoked upon message m will use, to compute its output, some randomizer, so that each encryption is different from previous ones. 9 iKP A Family of Secure Electronic Payment Protocols - 6 ?

But it can be made to provide an authentication like capability between parties sharing a key (such as the PIN).

Reference-contexts: Correct decryption convinces the decryptor that the transmitter knows the plaintext that was encrypted. In particular, tampering with ciphertext is detectable. Such encryption has been called plaintext-aware encryption, and simple schemes to achieve it in simple ways using RSA (or other common public key functions) are described in <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For example, [12] uses public-key cryptography between merchant and gateway, and the protocol sketched in [9] appears cryptographically similar to 2KP. The most cryptographically advanced electronic payment systems emphasize untraceability and anonymity against the payment system <ref> [3, 5, 6, 4, 10, 16] </ref>. Finally, there are some general security schemes for the World Wide Web, most notably, SHTTP [18] and SSL [14]. Both have been suggested as a basis for secure electronic payments. SHTTP is a possible platform for implementing iKP.

Reference-contexts: One of the biggest concerns is that of an adversary breaking into an acquirer computer through the Internet connection. Therefore, the acquirer's computer must be protected with the utmost care; including a very limited Internet connection using advanced firewall technology (e.g., <ref> [8, 7] </ref>.) Furthermore, the trust in the acquirer's computer must be limited, so that a break in would have a limited effect only. 4 Security Requirements In this section we consider a range of potential requirements for each party involved in the payment process: issuer/acquirer, merchant, and customer.
