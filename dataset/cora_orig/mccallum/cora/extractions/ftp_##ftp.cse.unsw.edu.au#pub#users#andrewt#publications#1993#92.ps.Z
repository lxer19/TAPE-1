Title: Systematic local flip rules are generalized Delaunay rules (Extended Abstract)  
Author: Timothy Lambert 
Abstract: A locally optimized triangulation (LOT) of a set of sites can be defined by a flip rule that determines which diagonal of a convex quadrilateral should be included in the triangulation. A flip rule is systematic if there is a unique LOT. It is local if the only new edges added when inserting a new site in the triangulation are adjacent to the new site. I prove that the only systematic local flip rules correspond to generalizations of convex distance function De-launay triangulations which I call empty shape triangulations.

Reference-contexts: To resolve this ambiguity one particular circumscribing shape must be chosen (e.g. the bottom leftmost one <ref> [12] </ref>). This 5 is effectively treating the flat part of the boundary as being very slightly curved, and the conditions of theorem 4 hold. If the cdf has corners then the conditions of theorem 5 are violated because there is no shape that rounds the corners of the cdf.
