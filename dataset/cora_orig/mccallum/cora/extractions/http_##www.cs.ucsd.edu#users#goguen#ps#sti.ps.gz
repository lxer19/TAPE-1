Abstract: We seek to take some initial steps towards a theory of information that is adequate for understanding and designing systems that process information, i.e., information systems in a broad sense. Formal representations of information are needed in designing, using and maintaining such systems, especially when they are computer based. However, it is also necessary to take account of social context, including how information is produced and used, not merely how it is represented; that is, we need a social theory of information. Ideas from ethnomethodology and semiotics, as well as logic and the sociology of science, are used to explore the nature of information. Ethnomethodology also provides guidelines for collecting high quality information on which to base design, especially in situations where interaction is important. In addition, some case studies and some ideas on how to combine methods are presented. We argue that, as a result of its social situatedness, information has an intrinsic ethical dimension, and that this may have some wider implications.

Agre <ref> [1] </ref> argues that the notion of information is itself a myth, mobilized to support certain institutions, such as libararies. 1 that "despite 50 years of progress, the software industry remains years | perhaps decades | short of the mature engineering discipline needed to meet the demands of an information-age society."

Reference-contexts: It follows that a suitable theory of information must be a social theory of information, rather than a statistical theory of information, like Shannon's theory [56], or a representational theory of information, like the situation theory of Barwise and Perry <ref> [3] </ref>. In fact, a theory of the kind we need cannot be "objectivist" or "realist," in the sense of assuming a pre-given distinction between subject and object, and an objectively given real world. <p> By contrast, a representational theory of meaning claims that a meaningful configuration of signs represents something in the real world. In sophisticated representational theories, such as situation semantics <ref> [3] </ref>, what is represented by (say) a given phrase in English can vary with the context where it is interpreted, and need not be a simple object, but can be a complex of interconnected relationships, that is, what they call a "situation." This is adequate for some purposes, but even the

Reference-contexts: Thus, in the first verse, they first went up, then Jack fell down, then he broke his crown, and then Jill came tumbling after. This basic principle is called the narrative presupposition. Note that it is a convention, and not a necessary feature of narratives; for example, Becker <ref> [4] </ref> shows that in Balinese narratives, if no special care is taken then the events reported in a sequence of narrative clauses are taken as occurring simultaneously rather than sequentially 11 . Because ordering is significant in English narratives, it is interesting to notice that Jack always comes before Jill.

Reference-contexts: A power struggle can be defined as a difference 18 among two or more groups in how to interpret some signs, or alternatively, as the failure of an information system to effectively function as a boundary object 15 . Boland <ref> [5] </ref> gives an interesting case study that illustrates the importance of power struggles in understanding organizations. The failure to take account of such factors explains why many large information systems have failed in practice.

Reference-contexts: Bowers <ref> [6] </ref> emphasizes this point particularly for formalisms; he criticizes the modernist rhetoric of emancipation through formalization, and suggests that undoing chains of rerepresen-tations may be an antidote (I suggest calling this derepresentation).

Reference-contexts: Requirements engineering has developed special tools, such as gIBIS <ref> [8] </ref>, to help collect and organize arguments for various positions on selected requirements issues. However, these tools are based on normatively given presuppositions about the way that projects should be organized, and serve mainly to increase the power of analysts.

Reference-contexts: Postmodernism, despite many valuable insights, encourages fragmentation through its attacks on the grand narratives that lend coherence to Western culture; this makes it difficult to respond to, or even conceptualize, contemporary environmental and social crises <ref> [11] </ref>. Ethnomethodology can be seen as taking a relativistic view that would prohibit discussions like that in this and the previous paragraph.

Reference-contexts: Ethnomethodology began as a reaction against the objective "scientific" and normative approach of traditional sociology <ref> [12] </ref>. Unfortunately, ethnomethodology can be difficult to understand; however [35], [59] and [21] give relatively comprehensible expositions of certain points. Ethnomethodology tries to reconcile a radical empiricism with the situatedness of social data, by looking closely at how competent members of a group actually organize their interactions. <p> Trust between members and analysts is often essential to the success of the analysis. Even in cases where such trust is neither sought nor secured, such as Garfinkel's "breaching experiments" <ref> [12] </ref>, a sense of compassion, that is, of being able to sympathize with members, seems essential to the analysis. This is a fundamentally ethical point. 3.6 Case Studies Case studies have been done to test the practical application of interaction analysis to requirements engineering.

Reference-contexts: It seems promising to apply methods from ethnomethodology to the sociology of science. Work that helps point the way has been done by Eric Livingston [41] on mathematics, and there are also ethnomethodological studies of several other fields of science, e.g., see <ref> [13] </ref> on the discovery of pulsars. Such an approach could help correct the lack of explicit empirical research in much current sociology of science. Another promising direction is to apply category systems to information systems.

We call these types of information dry and wet, respectively <ref> [15] </ref>. Note that there is really a continuum of "humidity" for information, e.g., there is "damp" information, of which cooking recipes are a typical example.

Parts of this work are drawn from <ref> [16] </ref> and [21]. <p> An abstract data type defines the space of all admissible configurations for a class of signs, along with methods for creating, modifying and retrieving configurations. The notion of situated abstract data type was introduced in <ref> [16] </ref> to explicate how information can be both contextual and structured. 2.4 Tacit Knowledge It can be difficult to find good data on which to base the design of information systems. Experience shows that simply asking managers what they want often works poorly. <p> These qualities can be applied in many ways. For example, they lead to some basic limitations of formalization. Because any formalization is information, it must be emergent, contingent, local, open and vague; for further discussion, see <ref> [16, 22] </ref>. We can also apply the list to obtain qualities of category systems, signs, interpretations, texts, etc. We can also use the qualities of information to understand why it is not possible to completely formalize requirements: it is because they cannot be fully separated from their social context. <p> These categories may not be recognized by users, but they are an important part of the apparatus of analysis. Members concepts and methods can be formalized using abstract data types <ref> [16] </ref>. This motivates a reexamination of Sacks' categorization devices as situated abstract data types, where the relationships between the formal and informal social aspects are taken into account; [16] shows that a great many such relationships are possible; this can be seen as an attempt for further develop and formalize Sacks' <p> Members concepts and methods can be formalized using abstract data types <ref> [16] </ref>.

It seems promising to apply methods from ethnomethodology to the sociology of science. <p> To sum up, I recommend a zooming method of requirements elicitation, whereby the more expensive but detailed methods are only employed selectively for problems that have been determined by other methods to be especially important <ref> [16] </ref>. From this point of view, the various methods based on ethnomethodology can be seen as analoguous to an electron microscope: they provide an instrument that is very accurate and powerful, but that is also expensive, and requires careful preparation to ensure that the right thing is examined. <p> Moreover, dryness comes not merely in different degrees, but also in a wide variety of kinds, resulting from the complex relationships of accountability between different communities, including that of analysts (e.g., see the examples in <ref> [16] </ref>). This applies to the observations of conversation analysis just as much as anything else. Information Systems are a particularly interesting site for research. <p> The formal context insensitive and the social context sensitive aspects of information are complementary, and can be very complex in that many different facets can arise in different social contexts, with different levels of abstraction, interconnected in complex ways, as shown by examples in <ref> [16] </ref>. It is the nature of technical design to construct dry structures, and design necessarily occurs at a meta level, involving a group that to some degree has separated itself from users.

Special thanks to Dr. Charlotte Linde for our long collaboration, during which I learned much of what I know about language.

(Or the subject may be rebellious, and try to frustrate the imagined partner.) Thus, protocols are an unnatural discourse form, and moreover, are unnatural in ways that are difficult to specify, as well as being based on an incorrect cognitivist model of human thought that ignores social context; <ref> [21] </ref> gives a detailed analysis of a protocol demonstrating its unnaturalness on linguistic grounds. None of these methods can elicit tacit knowledge. <p> Ethnomethodology began as a reaction against the objective "scientific" and normative approach of traditional sociology [12]. Unfortunately, ethnomethodology can be difficult to understand; however [35], [59] and <ref> [21] </ref> give relatively comprehensible expositions of certain points. Ethnomethodology tries to reconcile a radical empiricism with the situatedness of social data, by looking closely at how competent members of a group actually organize their interactions. <p> as providing useful general guidelines for how to collect high quality data about social interaction, and conversation and interaction analyses can be seen as embodying these guidelines in ways that are directly applicable to many practical problems in understanding and designing technology (some further discussion and examples are given in <ref> [21] </ref>). Also, they can be used to obtain tacit knowledge, because they bypass the unreliable explanations of users and managers, and instead examine what actually happens.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the same configuration of signs can mean different things in different contexts. The structure of information is how it is configured; formalization makes that structure more precise and explicit, through use of a metalanguage. The notion of abstract data type <ref> [23] </ref> uses the very dry metalanguage of abstract algebra for formalizing structure. This approach also formalizes the notion "representation independence," that the same structure can be represented in different ways.

Reference-contexts: Thus, information is always subject to revision, and is often revised as events unfold. Empirical support for this view can be found in work on plans and explanations reported in [39] and <ref> [24] </ref>, and in the important work of Suchman [59] on situated planing. <p> A discourse unit is a structural, linguistic unit directly above the sentence. Some common examples that have been studied extensively are the oral narrative of personal experience [32, 37, 48], the joke [52], the explanation <ref> [24] </ref>, the spatial description [36, 40], and the plan [39]. A discourse unit has two criterial properties: defined boundaries, and a describable internal structure.

Reference-contexts: Thus, values are a necessary presupposition of ethnomethodological analysis: members' accountability to shared values renders their concepts and methods visible to analysts. Jayyusi <ref> [29] </ref> puts it as follows: What emerges from both Garfinkel's and Sacks' work is the understanding that all communicative praxis presupposes, and is founded in, a `natural' ethic | an ethic, that is, which is constitutive of, and reflexively constituted by, the natural attitude of everyday life.

Reference-contexts: Interaction analysis extends conversation analysis from audio to video data, particularly in institutional settings. See [25] for a recent overview of conversation analysis, and <ref> [31] </ref> for a collection of essays on interaction analysis. Both these fields are strongly empirically based, in the sense that any phenomenon asserted by analysts must be "warranted" (i.e., supported) by evidence that members in some way orient to that phenomenon, i.e., noticeably use it to organize interaction. <p> Conversation and interaction analyses can help to uncover limitations of other methods. Interaction analysis can be used to discover details of nonverbal interaction in real work environments <ref> [31] </ref>; but the effort required to produce video transcripts suggests that this method should be used very selectively. 17 Ethnography should be used continually to provide context for results obtained by other methods.

Reference-contexts: The linguistic approaches arise from sociolinguistics, and consider the internal structure of certain discourse forms; this subsection concentrates on the linguistic approach. A discourse unit is a structural, linguistic unit directly above the sentence. Some common examples that have been studied extensively are the oral narrative of personal experience <ref> [32, 37, 48] </ref>, the joke [52], the explanation [24], the spatial description [36, 40], and the plan [39]. A discourse unit has two criterial properties: defined boundaries, and a describable internal structure. <p> Moreover, discourse structure can be described with just as much mathematical precision as sentential syntax ([39, 24] present an appropriate mathematical apparatus). The principle of accountability suggests that a member of some group telling a story should establish its relevance to the audience. In a classic paper, William Labov <ref> [32] </ref> showed that narratives of personal experience, in which the narrator is an agent, are discourse units. For our present purpose, it suffices to consider just two aspects of narrative structure. <p> Let us illustrate these ideas with a nursery rhyme. This is not a naturally occurring spontaneous story, let alone a narrative of personal experience, as studied by Labov <ref> [32] </ref>. However, it is often read, or repeated from memory, to children in natural social settings, and thus an analysis of its values should tell us something about our society. Our analysis will omitting many details of argument; otherwise, it could be too tedious to read. <p> A related method determines work structure from task oriented discourse. These methods primarily use narratives of personal experience, in which an individual relates events that were personally experienced <ref> [32] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One exciting voice in this field is Bruno Latour, who has suggested certain properties that distinguish scientific work from other kinds of work <ref> [33] </ref>. Latour introduces the phrase immutable mobile for a representation 6 that can be interpreted in essentially the same way in a variety of contexts; thus, immutable mobiles are information structures that have been dried out. To illustrate this concept, Latour [33] discusses the use of cartographic maps for navigation: given <p> that distinguish scientific work from other kinds of work <ref> [33] </ref>. Latour introduces the phrase immutable mobile for a representation 6 that can be interpreted in essentially the same way in a variety of contexts; thus, immutable mobiles are information structures that have been dried out. To illustrate this concept, Latour [33] discusses the use of cartographic maps for navigation: given the proper instruments and proper conditions (e.g., good weather), such maps can be used anywhere in the world; but each such use is still a local interpretation. <p> concentrated. 6 It is not so clear what Latour means by a "representation," but for present purposes, it should simply be considered a configuration of signs, without any necessary representational connection to "real" objects. 7 These can be seen as "semiotic morphisms" in the sense of [17]. 7 As Latour <ref> [33] </ref> points out, the construction of immutable mobiles can be a way to mobilize power. Bowers [6] emphasizes this point particularly for formalisms; he criticizes the modernist rhetoric of emancipation through formalization, and suggests that undoing chains of rerepresen-tations may be an antidote (I suggest calling this derepresentation).

Reference-contexts: On the contrary, this list derives its plausibility from its similarity to many other such lists. For example, qualities like these are familiar to anthropologists (e.g., see various comments by Levi-Strauss in <ref> [34] </ref>), although anthropologists have not (to my knowledge) been very precise in distinguishing among different qualities. Also, Suchman [59] gives a similar list of qualities for plans, which was a major inspiration for the above list.

Reference-contexts: It may seem surprising that values are an integral part of the internal structure of stories, rather than being confined to an optional "moral" given at the end. Evaluative material sometimes appears in explicit "evaluative clauses," but usually appears in more implicit forms <ref> [38] </ref>, and indeed, its syntactic expression is a significant clue to its importance in a given story.

Reference-contexts: Thus, information is always subject to revision, and is often revised as events unfold. Empirical support for this view can be found in work on plans and explanations reported in <ref> [39] </ref> and [24], and in the important work of Suchman [59] on situated planing. <p> A discourse unit is a structural, linguistic unit directly above the sentence.

A discourse unit has two criterial properties: defined boundaries, and a describable internal structure. The property of definable boundaries means that the discourse unit is bounded; for example, (with some interesting exceptions) we know when a speaker is or is not engaged in a narrative.

Reference-contexts: It seems promising to apply methods from ethnomethodology to the sociology of science. Work that helps point the way has been done by Eric Livingston <ref> [41] </ref> on mathematics, and there are also ethnomethodological studies of several other fields of science, e.g., see [13] on the discovery of pulsars. Such an approach could help correct the lack of explicit empirical research in much current sociology of science.

Reference-contexts: We can relate this discussion to the work of Jean-Fran~cois Lyotard <ref> [42] </ref> on information in the postmodernism age. For Lyotard, modern societies rely on the values in meta-narratives, or "grand unifying stories," to legitimate their institutions. The grand narratives of Western civilization support the domination and exploitation of nature.

Reference-contexts: In particular, ethnomethodology looks at the categories and methods members use to render their actions intelligible to one another; this contrasts with presupposing that the categories and methods of the analyst are necessarily superior to those of members. The methods and 8 Penrose <ref> [45] </ref> gives an elegant and readable exposition that illustrates just how strange the theories of contem porary physics can be. 9 Of course, this does not imply that such accounts are always requested, or even usually requested. 10 categories of members are identifiable through the procedures by which members are held

Reference-contexts: Of course, there may be boundary disputes, either at the beginning, during which a speaker negotiates with hearers whether the narrative will be told, or at the end, where the speaker may negotiate the proper response to the unit with hearers <ref> [52, 47, 48] </ref>. However, such negotiations do not mean that the unit is not structurally bounded. Rather, they imply that its boundaries are negotiated, i.e., they are social.

Reference-contexts: This is not because managers are incompetent; on the contrary, they are (usually) genuine experts at their own job. Rather, it is due to what philosophers <ref> [49] </ref> call the problem of tacit knowledge, i.e., the phenomenon that people may know how to do something, without being able to articulate how they do it.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, the activities that are necessary for a successful system development project cannot always be expected to fit in a natural way into any system of pre-given categories, and practicing software engineers often report (informally) that they have to spend much of their time circumventing "the system." Robinson and Bannon <ref> [50] </ref> show that representations pass through multiple "semantic communities" during the construction of complex systems, and suggest this implies that such "work-arounds" should not be surprising in practice. 2.6 Sociology of Science There have been important new developments in the sociology of science.

Reference-contexts: Through immersion in data from some particular social group, the particular competencies are gradually acquired that enable the analyst to be a sensitive and effective instrument in that domain. In this way, subjectivity is harnessed, rather than rejected. Sacks <ref> [51] </ref> demonstrated that members' categories often come as part of category systems 10 , which are collections of category distinctions that members treat as naturally co-occurring. Sacks also gave some rules that govern the use of such systems, and showed how these provide a rich resource for interpreting ordinary conversation. <p> Also, they can be used to obtain tacit knowledge, because they bypass the unreliable explanations of users and managers, and instead examine what actually happens. However, these are far from the only way to elicit requirements, and may not be the best methods for some circumstances. 10 Actually, Sacks <ref> [51] </ref> called these "categorization devices." 11 3.3 Some Limitations of Ethnomethodology For present purposes (which are understanding and designing information systems), ethnomethod-ology and the methods based on it have some significant limitations. These include the following: 1.

In fact, a theory of the kind we need cannot be "objectivist" or "realist," in the sense of assuming a pre-given distinction between subject and object, and an objectively given real world.

Reference-contexts: In particular, it is usually a good idea to start with an ethnographic study to uncover basic aspects of social order, such as basic concept systems used by members, the division into social groups, some typical patterns of work of various social groups, etc. (see <ref> [57] </ref> for a review of ethnography in relation to requirements engineering). After this, one might use questionnaires or interviews to explore what problems members see as most important, how members place themselves in various classification schemes, etc.

Reference-contexts: A tool that tries to make requirements information more relevant to users and their needs is described in [46], with further motivation given in [18].

Reference-contexts: For example, qualities like these are familiar to anthropologists (e.g., see various comments by Levi-Strauss in [34]), although anthropologists have not (to my knowledge) been very precise in distinguishing among different qualities. Also, Suchman <ref> [59] </ref> gives a similar list of qualities for plans, which was a major inspiration for the above list. On the other hand, the categories in the list are themselves vague and partially overlapping, and the list itself should be considered open; that is, this list of qualities applies to itself. <p> Thus, information is always subject to revision, and is often revised as events unfold. Empirical support for this view can be found in work on plans and explanations reported in [39] and [24], and in the important work of Suchman <ref> [59] </ref> on situated planing. <p> Ethnomethodology began as a reaction against the objective "scientific" and normative approach of traditional sociology [12].

Reference-contexts: However, this method is still limited by the need for the participants to share basic concepts and methods, without which they will be unable to negotiate shared meanings for the questions asked. Open ended interviews are also more vulnerable to distortion by interviewer bias. (See <ref> [60] </ref> for a more detailed discussion of this topic, including some examples.) These limitations also apply to focus groups, and to their cousins in requirements engineering, called JAD (or RAD) groups. In addition, these methods are vulnerable to political manipulations by participants, as many experienced requirements know from bitter experience.
