The official version of this paper has been published by the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (http://www.aaai.org).

They suggest that in societies where agents can possess such characteristics, to behave rationally, in the usual sense in Game Theory, is not the best attitude for good performance in the long run, both individually and for the group.
