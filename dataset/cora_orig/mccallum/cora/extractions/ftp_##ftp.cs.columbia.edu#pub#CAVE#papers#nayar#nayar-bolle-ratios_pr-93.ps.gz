Abstract: This paper presents a photometric invariant called reflectance ratio that can be computed from a single brightness image of a scene. The brightness variation in an image of a surface depends on several factors; the three-dimensional shape of the surface, its reflectance properties, and the illumination conditions. Since neighboring points on a smoothly curved surface have similar surface orientations, their brightness values can be used to compute the ratio of their reflectance coefficients. Based on this observation, we develop an algorithm that estimates a reflectance ratio for each region in the image with respect to its background. The algorithm is computationally efficient as it computes ratios for all image regions in just two raster scans. In the first scan, the image is segmented into regions using a sequential labeling algorithm. During labeling, the reflectance ratio between adjacent pixels is used as a measure of connectivity. In the second scan, a reflectance ratio is computed for each image region as an average of the ratios computed for all points that lie on its boundary. The region reflectance ratio is also a photometric invariant; it represents a physical property of the region and is invariant to the illumination conditions. Several experimental results are included to demonstrate the invariance of reflectance ratios to imaging and illumination parameters. We conclude with a brief discussion on the application of reflectance ratios to the problems of object recognition and visual inspection.

Reference-contexts: It has been widely used in the context of binary images [12, 7] where it is straightforward to determine if two image pixels are "connected." Algorithms have also been proposed that use near equal brightness values to determine the similarity between pixels in gray-scale images <ref> [1] </ref>. We use the reflectance ratio as a measure of similarity between two neighboring pixels. Let p (A; B) denote the reflectance ratio ( A B )=( A + B ) of two neighboring pixels A and B.

Reference-contexts: This photometric invariant, referred to as the reflectance ratio, provides valuable information for machine vision applications such as object recognition and inspection. Traditionally, object recognition systems have used only geometric (shape) information to represent objects of interest and to recognize them <ref> [2, 5] </ref>. Recognizing a three-dimensional object in a two-dimensional brightness image is more a problem of appearance matching rather than shape matching. Appearance is related not only to shape but also reflectance and illumination.

Reference-contexts: Later, Land and McCann [11] proposed a one-dimensional hardware implementation for computing lightness. Subsequently, Horn [8] extended these ideas to two dimensions and proposed several analog methods for implementing the lightness computation. Horn's approach was later improved upon by Blake <ref> [3] </ref>. The main idea underlying Land's lightness computation is global consistency. The lightness value computed for any particular region must be consistent with those computed elsewhere in the image. However, realistic images include shadows, occlusions, and noise.

Reference-contexts: Second, every optical system is characterized by a blur function; due to imperfect imaging optics, each point in the scene is projected onto a small patch (not a point) of the image sensor <ref> [4] </ref>. Thus, the pixels on and around the edge end up with different labels from the region and the background. One way of computing the reflectance ratio P (S) of a region S is by using the average brightness of the region and the average brightness of the background.

Reference-contexts: Next, a reflectance ratio is computed for each region and its background using only points that lie close to the region's boundary. In this approach, the reflectance ratio computed for any particular region is not affected by those computed for regions elsewhere in the image. Adopting another approach, Finlayson <ref> [6] </ref> recently used ratios of neighboring pixels in three color channels to compute histograms for object recognition. In their analysis and experiments, Land and McCann [11] restricted themselves to planar (two-dimensional) scenes with patches of constant reflectance.

Reference-contexts: The reflectance ratio invariant presented in this paper is an example of a physical property that can be robustly and efficiently computed from a single image. The problem of computing the reflectance of regions in a scene was first addressed by Land <ref> [10] </ref>. In general, image brightness is the product of surface reflectance and illumination. Hence, it is impossible to separate the contributions of reflectance and illumination at a single image point if the point is treated in isolation. <p> It is computed using a single image of the scene and provides important information regarding the physical properties of surface regions in the scene. Before proceeding any further, it is worthwhile to compare our approach with Land's retinex theory <ref> [10] </ref>. Our objective is similar to that of Land's, that is, to compute the reflectance of regions in a scene by computing variations in image brightness across region boundaries. Land's analysis of brightness variations does not however include the problem of curved surfaces.

In contrast, our derivation of the reflectance ratio is based on the analysis of regions that lie on curved surfaces.

Reference-contexts: The exact functional form of R (s; v; n) is determined to a great extent by microscopic structure of the surface; generally R () includes a diffuse component and a specular component <ref> [13] </ref>. Once again, the reflection coefficient is the fraction of incident light that is reflected by the surface. It represents the reflective power of the surface and is sometimes referred to as surface albedo. Consider two neighboring points on a surface (Figure 1).
