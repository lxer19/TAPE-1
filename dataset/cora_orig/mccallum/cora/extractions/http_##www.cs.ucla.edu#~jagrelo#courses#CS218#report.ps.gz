Abstract: CS218 Project Report Abstract With the predictable spread use of ATM as the platform for the Integrated Services Networks, a great number of studies have been done on the multimedia traffic transmission over it. Efficient encoding schemes of multimedia traffic using perceptual coding produce variable bit rate (VBR) traffic and this is one of the most challenging traffic types for ATM networks due to its complex characteristics and its QoS requirements. In this paper we will describe the problems that appear as well as several proposed solutions to alleviate them, restricting our study to the transmission of traffic generated by MPEG sources.

Reference-contexts: All of this has promoted a great research activity in all of the aspects related to video encoding and transmission. The MPEG standards have been chosen as the base for the video/audio encoding schemes <ref> [1] </ref> and have received the greatest attention in the different studies done so far. These encoding schemes provide several video qualities with high compression ratios, and the obtained rates fall in the range which goes from 1.14 to 8 Mbit/s for the different resolutions. <p> The MPEG-2 standard shares the basic ideas underlying MPEG and the current proposals for TV and Video-on-Demand (VoD) transmission over ATM use it as the video encoding scheme <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.1 The compression algorithm Due to the conflicting requirements of random access and high compression rates, the MPEG encoding schemes use three 2 kind of pictures called respectively Intra (I), Predictive (P ) and Bidirectional (B) or interpolated pictures.

Reference-contexts: Models are also used in the implementation of adaptive rate mechanisms based on prediction. Among the different models proposed and used for the simulation and/or prediction of the traffic from MPEG sources, we have: * 2-State Markov Modulated Bernoulli Process (MMBP) <ref> [5] </ref>: This model can emulate simple bursty sources with On/Off behavior and allows simple analysis.

Reference-contexts: It is however a model too simple to catch the complex characteristics of MPEG traffic. * 3-State MMBP <ref> [6] </ref>: The use of a MMBP with a different state for each of the three picture types is a better model of the MPEG traffic. The model considers a set of transition probabilities and a mean cell generation rate for each state.

Reference-contexts: For sources where the rate variation within a picture type is high the error should be expected to be high, although we do not of any formal study done for this case. * Mean and Standard Deviation based model <ref> [7] </ref>: This model was proposed for bandwidth estimation, however the standard deviation of the MPEG traffic is generally too large to predict accurately the traffic in the next picture based in the previous one. 5 * Autoregressive (AR) model with Gaussian process [8]: Although this model can be suitable for less <p> However, the problem with this scheme is that how we determine what bandwidth should be reserved. One possible solution is to allocate a bandwidth which equals to the sum of mean and standard deviation <ref> [7] </ref>. 4.3.2 Dynamic bandwidth reservation Dynamic bandwidth reservation tries to allocate bandwidth dynamically during the transmission process. <p> In this way, we can avoid some of the problems incurred from static bandwidth allocation scheme. In the following paragraphs, we will summarize two of the dynamic bandwidth reservation schemes. A. Dynamic bandwidth reservation using prediction with standard coder <ref> [7] </ref> Due to the burstiness nature of MPEG traffic, it is often very difficult to accurately estimate the cell generation rate for the next frame. <p> However, if we can model our MPEG source using a Markov Chain Model, then the probability of cell generation rate increasing by greater than one standard deviation in next frame is small. Based on the above argument, <ref> [7] </ref> uses the following formula to estimate the cell generation rate for next frame: C n = max (; C n1 + ) Here C n represents the estimate number of cells generated by the coder in frame n; C n1 is the actual bandwidth requirement for frame n 1; is <p> The reason is that we have to use intraframe which is 16 frames earlier to estimate the cell generation rate for the next intraframe. Hence, the coherence is not as close as in pure coder. B. Dynamic bandwidth reservation using prediction with layered coder <ref> [7] </ref> For layered coder (a MPEG coder which prioritize its cells as HP (High Priority) and LP (Low Priority) cells) , the reserved bandwidth will first fill up HP cells, if extra bandwidth left, LP cells will be filled. <p> The second needs to use a prediction scheme which can estimate the HP stream cell rate based on previous HP stream cell rate. In <ref> [7] </ref> are proposed the following two steps: 1. estimate HP traffic using c HP n1 + (fi) Here c HP n fi is the estimated cell rate of frame n at fi value for HP stream; c HP n1 is the actual HP cell rate from frame n 1; (fi) is

Reference-contexts: The problem is in determining the state for each period of time. * AR Model with Picture Decomposition <ref> [10] </ref>: This model uses different AR models for each type of picture, and it has been used for traffic prediction. <p> In MPEG, as we mentioned before, the highest rates are due to the I pictures. The P pictures produce medium rates while the B pictures produce the lowest rates. A proposed smoothing scheme <ref> [10] </ref> uses lower transmission rates for I and P pictures and higher for B pictures, while maintaining the overall delay for a window comprising several pictures constant. <p> With any of these two schemes, the burstiness has showed <ref> [10] </ref> to decrease linearly with d, and a reduction of nearly one half can be obtained in some cases applying a one-picture delay. 4.5 Source Control Using Prediction In previous dynamic bandwidth scheme, we assume that we can always obtain the desired bandwidth on a frame by frame basis.

Reference-contexts: But for MPEG video, this could be significant and we can see the effects in <ref> [11] </ref>. This simulation assumes the multiplexer accepts incoming cells and places them in a common buffer with limited capacity. The cell stream emitted by each video source is assumed to be suitably paced during a frame interval.

Reference-contexts: When a network congestion occurs, the network can drop some less important frames, such as B frames and transfer the more important frames, such as I frames. Han and Orozco-Barbosa <ref> [12] </ref> proposed a priority scheme. It labels I and P frames as High Priority and B frames as low priority frames. When network congestion occurs, B frames are dropped first. During the simulation, they assume that only the low priority frames may be lost. We think this is unrealistic. <p> Otherwise, several macroblocks, an entire slice, even an entire picture could be corrupted due to the lost of one cell. Therefore, it is very important for a decoder to be able to detect the loss information to reduce the propagation of impairments. In <ref> [12] </ref> a Dummy Cell insertion scheme is introduced to solve this problem, where the lost information is replaced with a fixed code. The objective is to define a proper code for the dummy cell to be inserted to allow the decoder to detect quickly that information has been lost.

Reference-contexts: Although the author claims a good result for the above scheme, however, we fill that this scheme will inevitably result in a fluctuation of service quality at receiver's end. 5 Our Suggestion: Multi-layered Encoding Chiueh and Katz <ref> [13] </ref> proposed a new pyramid fashion encoding scheme. When Encoding a MPEG video, we can store multi-resolution information in the base substreams. In this way, more levels of resolutions can be supported. The different levels of resolution in the base substream can be arranged as either Laplacian or Gaussian pyramids.
