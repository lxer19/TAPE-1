Reference-contexts: Fortunately, there are better estimates that are valid for all but a few "exceptional" moduli; see [8], [26]. Our argument is based on the following special case of Theorem 2.1 from <ref> [1] </ref>, where we have set A = 49=20, * = 1=2, and ffi = 2=245 in that Theorem. We denote, as is usual, by (y; d; a) the number of primes up to y in the arithmetic progression a + dN, so that (y) = (y; 1; 1).

Reference-contexts: Weil estimate|exploiting the algebraic nature of the Frobenius roots|are in [34, 35], and [39], Chapter 5. [43] show N 1 (C) g (q 1=2 1) + o (g) for curves of large genus over a fixed field; this is twice better than the Weil estimate. [9] (1986, Theorem 4.9) and <ref> [2] </ref> (1993) show that some 2 variants of (2) hold for absolutely irreducible projective curves even if they are singular. Bach shows that (2) holds for the arithmetic genus g, which also satisfies g (d 1)(d 2)=2.

Reference-contexts: Apparently no "Weil estimate" has been previously known for this problem, 3 however, a special case of our resulting formula, namely for the total image size of a polynomial, is essentially in <ref> [3] </ref>. In Section 4, we show that curve counting is #P-complete via probabilistic Tu-ring reductions if the defining polynomial f 2 F q [x; y] is given in sparse representation. <p> We apply Lemma 3.1 to the curve C = fg 1 (y) = xg 2 (y)g. A formula essentially equivalent to Lemma 3.1 in the particular case of f = g 1 2 F q [x] is in <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Proof. It is well-known that r can be calculated by a fast continued-fraction algorithm in F (x)[y] and using the subresultant description of r with O (M (d) log d) operations in F (x); see, e.g., <ref> [11] </ref>, steps 4, 5, 6 of the algorithm in Section 2. By the subresultant theory, the degree in x of each intermediate result is at most d 2 , so that the total cost is O (M (d)M (d 2 ) log d) operations in F .

Reference-contexts: If R R [y]=(f ) = S is an extension of degree m, then one can multiply in S [x] with O (M (mn)) operations in R (see <ref> [13] </ref>, Lemma 2.2). All logarithms in this paper are natural. 2 Estimating the size of a curve over a prime field We propose a deterministic "strip counting" algorithm to estimate the size of curves over a prime field F q . <p> By the subresultant theory, the degree in x of each intermediate result is at most d 2 , so that the total cost is O (M (d)M (d 2 ) log d) operations in F . In fact, using Lemma 2.2 from <ref> [13] </ref>, this can be done with O (M (d 3 ) log d) operations.

"Time" will usually mean arithmetic operations in F q ; the number of bit operations is at most a factor O~(log q) larger, where the "soft-O" notation s = O~(t) means that s = t (log t + 2) O (1) . <ref> [27] </ref> presented an algorithm for calculating N n (C) that generalized Schoof's (1985) method, which applies to elliptic curves.

In those papers, membership in NP or #P was left as an open question. This is answered affirmatively for the curve counting problem, and as a consequence we also solve this open question for the special variant of the gcd problem that we consider. <p> We rely on hardness results proved by <ref> [30] </ref>, which in turn are based on Plaisted's (1977, 1984) work. A bonus of our approach is that we have upper bounds matching the previously known lower bounds, so that now some variants of Plaisted's and Quick's problems are shown to be complete for NP and #P, respectively. <p> We are very grateful to Kevin McCurley and to Carl Pomerance for helping us to understand their results on primes in arithmetic progressions.

[43] show N 1 (C) g (q 1=2 1) + o (g) for curves of large genus over a fixed field; this is twice better than the Weil estimate. [9] (1986, Theorem 4.9) and [2] (1993) show that some 2 variants of (2) hold for absolutely irreducible projective <p> The latter paper gives O~(n 7 log 2 q (n 5 +log q)) bit operations. These algorithms are probabilistic of the Las Vegas type, i.e., they never return an incorrect answer, but they may fail, with controllably small probability. <ref> [39] </ref>, Theorem 1.7, gives a deterministic method whose cost is O (n 3:7 log q) for almost all input polynomials. We will assume from now on, without loss of generality, that f is squarefree. <p> Then the image of T ffi f : F m q n ! F q can be calculated with ((nt + 1) (p1)r + 2) m or (nt) O (mpr) evaluations of T ffi f. Proof. Using the algorithms of [37] or [38] (see also <ref> [39] </ref>), we can construct in time (pn) O (1) a set M F q with cardinality (pn) O (1) containing a primitive root of F q .

Reference-contexts: It relies on the general principle that the "behaviour" of a curve or an algebraic variety over a wide enough "strip" is the same as over the whole field; <ref> [40] </ref> gives another example of using this principle. We will use the following notation: K is an algebraic closure of F q , X K m+1 is a curve of degree d, C = X " F m+1 q are the rational points of X over F q .

Reference-contexts: A formula essentially equivalent to Lemma 3.1 in the particular case of f = g 1 2 F q [x] is in [3]. The results of this and the previous section can be extended to counting complete intersections over finite fields, by using the results of <ref> [41] </ref> on the distribution of points on such varieties instead of Lemma 2.1. 4 #P -completeness of sparse curve counting In this section, we show that the counting problem for sparsely represented curves over finite fields is #P-complete, via probabilistic Turing reductions.
