Reference-contexts: Unlike other techniques, data visualization emphasizes the importance of close human-tool interaction. This special requirement poses both a challenge to the human interface designer of a visualization system and an opportunity for highly productive mode of data exploration. Collaborative visualization is rapidly gaining popularity [WWHK95], <ref> [AC97] </ref>. It is motivated by several important factors. First of all, the advancement of networking infrastructure, especially Internet provides more chances for collaboration across physical boundaries. Secondly, separate administrative domains and data ownership sometimes make collaborative data analysis the only way of data analysis.

Reference-contexts: More discussion about view sharing can be found in the future work section. In the following parts of this section, we describe the architecture of the collaboration environ ment and the command object layer that handles command propagation. 5 4.1 Architecture of Collaboration in the architecture picture. Collaborator <ref> [AT97] </ref> is an independent process that manages group membership database, controls token exchange and provides group-cast services. The collaborator also coordinates the checkpointing between a group leader (Active server in Figure 2) and a new member of the group. (Passive server in Figure 2).

Reference-contexts: From the perspective of query submission, we abstract view from another direction. We treat a view as a collection of TData attributes <ref> [KCDK98] </ref> plus the ranges for those attributes. We define these attributes as View Variables and corresponding ranges as View Variable Ranges.

Reference-contexts: In section 5, we propose future direction for our research. 2 DEVise Overview DEVise is a complicated visualization system with built-in DBMS support, graph rendering, multiple-level caching of intermediate data etc. For a comprehensive formal treatment of DEVise, interested readers are referred to the classic DEVise paper <ref> [MR97] </ref>. 1 In this section, we presents a skeleton description of DEVise's data at different stage of visualization process and data flow between stages. In figure 1, the oval boxes represent the data objects and the rectangular boxes represent operators. <p> Many directions are worth exploring. View sharing and protection is an immediate issue. DEVise has a rich set of primitives <ref> [MR97] </ref> that correlates views with each other. How to handle Share/Non-share views in the context of strong correlation is major challenge. Visual queries based on views are transformed into simultaneous multiple queries. We are looking for a good abstraction of sharing so that multiple queries optimization can take advantage of.

Reference-contexts: Wide commercial use of DBMS systems and modern scientific research have accumulated a wealth of data. How to effectively extract knowledge from large amount of data becomes the unifying theme for quite a few data exploration techniques, such as Data Mining <ref> [PSF91] </ref>, OLAP [SU96]. Unlike other techniques, data visualization emphasizes the importance of close human-tool interaction. This special requirement poses both a challenge to the human interface designer of a visualization system and an opportunity for highly productive mode of data exploration. Collaborative visualization is rapidly gaining popularity [WWHK95], [AC97].
