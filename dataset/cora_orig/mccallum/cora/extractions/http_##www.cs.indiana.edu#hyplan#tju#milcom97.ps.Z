Abstract: This paper discusses the issues to consider when selecting congestion control scheme for an integrated ground radio and satellite network engaging primarily in transmitting multimedia traffic, and then it proceeds to discuss effects (both positive and negative) of smoothing rendered on the input traffic as a congestion control scheme. We chose traffic shaping by smoothing rendered on the input traffic as the congestion control scheme to use for our mixed ground/satellite network due to the considerations of satellite's long propagation delay, high bandwidth of ground network, and the real-time nature of the traffic. Traffic shaping in our case, involves smoothing and policing the traffic by using the "virtual token buckets" and our original "multi-buckets" (i.e., virtual token buckets plus one additional leaky bucket). The simulation results show that in the case of congestion, virtual token buckets and multi-buckets algorithms, improve throughput significantly for the ground/satellite network, with virtual token buckets slightly outperforming multi-buckets. Our experimental multi-buckets algorithm is useful, because it is capable of rendering additional smoothing, and thus affording us more flexibility to examine the impact of smoothing. The fact that virtual token buckets outperforms slightly the multi-buckets shows that more smoothing does not always render better throughput, and confirms that factors such as the tradeoffs between smoothing and network utilization, burstiness of the streams, and the number of congested hops traversed need to be considered when examining the usefulness of smoothing.

Specifically, Piironen addressed the problem for ATM/Satellite networks while Lee addressed the problem for satellite frame relay networks. Both use feedback mechanism to address the problem. However we feel that feedback approach is inappropriate.

Reference-contexts: However, limiting the size of token bucket foregoes the advantage of the speed-up feature. The point is that the network may not mind getting a lot of data close together from a flow, provided there is some space for other traffic. <ref> [6] </ref> provides a good discussion for this point. 3.4.3 Virtual Token Buckets Algorithm Our discussion now shifts back to token bucket discussed Section 3.4.1. With token bucket, there are still two more disadvantages.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Although the congestion control problem has been studied by researchers for a long time, satellite links coupled with ground network introduce a new dimension. For a good general discussion on the congestion control problem, see Yang and Reddy [11], Brett et. al. [10], Jain <ref> [8] </ref> and Tanenbaum [9]. The goal of our work regarding congestion control to date is twofold: 1. To address what congestion control approach best suits mixed ground/satellite network (which may involve high-speed ground network like ATM) engaging primarily in transmitting real-time traffic.

The results hopefully can be extended to ATM networks as well. In section below, leaky bucket, along with its variants are discussed in further details.

The token buckets here in our implementation are without internal queue. Vickers et. al. <ref> [10] </ref> provides a good discussion on this subject matter. 3.4.4 Multi-buckets Algorithm By adding the concepts mentioned above to the concept of combining leaky bucket and token bucket in Section 3.4.2, we have the resultant three buckets algorithm which we term multi-buckets algorithm.

Also, the maximum number of congested hop (i.e., satellite node) traversed in our MSE network incidentally, is one. 3 Proposed Congestion Control Schemes Yang and Reddy <ref> [11] </ref> have developed a taxonomy for congestion control algorithms. Yang and Reddy begin by dividing all algorithms into either open loop or closed loop.
