Abstract: This paper presents new single-layer, i.e., planar-embeddable, clock tree constructions with exact zero skew under either the linear or the Elmore delay model. Our method, called Planar-DME, consists of two parts. The first algorithm, called Linear-Planar-DME, guarantees an optimal planar zero-skew clock tree (ZST) under the linear delay model. The second algorithm, called Elmore-Planar-DME, uses the Linear-Planar-DME connection topology in constructing a low-cost ZST according to the Elmore delay model. While a planar ZST under the linear delay model is easily converted to a planar ZST under the Elmore model by elongating tree edges in bottom-up order, our key idea is to avoid unneeded wire elongation by iterating the DME construction of ZST and the bottom-up modification of the resulting non-planar routing. Costs of our planar ZST solutions are comparable to those of the best previous non-planar ZST solutions, and substantially improve over previous planar clock routing methods.

Reference-contexts: The above methods all concentrate on generation of the clock tree topology: the topology is then embedded in the plane more or less arbitrarily as it is generated. The Deferred-Merge Embedding 2 (DME) method, which was discovered independently by three groups <ref> [3, 4, 11] </ref>, is a linear-time algorithm which optimally embeds any given topology in the Manhattan plane, i.e., with exact zero skew and minimum total wirelength. <p> Because the properties of the DME construction are central to our present work, we now provide a review of DME following the development in <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> nodes of G via: (i) a bottom-up phase that constructs a tree of merging segments which represent loci of possible placements of internal nodes in the ZST T ; and (ii) a top-down embedding phase that determines exact locations for the internal nodes in G (see Figure 3, reproduced from <ref> [3] </ref>). In the bottom-up phase (Figure 3a), each node v 2 G is associated with a merging segment which represents a set of possible placements of v in a minimum-cost ZST. <p> The collection of points within a fixed distance of a Manhattan arc is called a tilted rectangular region, or TRR, whose boundary is composed of Manhattan arcs (Figure 1, reproduced from <ref> [3] </ref>). The Manhattan arc at the center of the TRR is called its core. Finally, the radius of a TRR is the distance between its core and its boundary. Note that a Manhattan arc is itself a TRR with radius 0. <p> ms (b) are both Manhattan arcs, then ms (v) = trr a " trr b is obtained by intersecting two TRRs, trr a with core ms (a) and radius je a j, and trr b with core ms (b) and radius je b j (see Figure 2, also reproduced from <ref> [3] </ref>). Boese and Kahng [3] show that if ms (a) and ms (b) are both Manhattan arcs, then ms (v) is also a Manhattan arc. <p> Manhattan arcs, then ms (v) = trr a " trr b is obtained by intersecting two TRRs, trr a with core ms (a) and radius je a j, and trr b with core ms (b) and radius je b j (see Figure 2, also reproduced from <ref> [3] </ref>). Boese and Kahng [3] show that if ms (a) and ms (b) are both Manhattan arcs, then ms (v) is also a Manhattan arc. <p> Note that DME requires an input topology. Several works have thus proposed topology constructions that yield low-cost routing solutions when DME is applied. Below, we compare against the non-planar KCR+DME <ref> [3] </ref> and Greedy-DME [12] methods. 1 If a fixed clock source location clk has been specified, DME chooses l (s 0 ) 2 ms (s 0 ) with minimum distance from clk and connects a wire directly from clk to l (s 0 ). 4 Procedure Build Tree of Segments (G,S) <p> This leads to what we call the Single-Pass DME algorithm. The following Facts and Theorem are crucial to the development of the Single-Pass DME and then the Linear-Planar-DME algorithms. Two useful facts are due to <ref> [3] </ref>. Fact 1 is a straightforward extension of Theorem 2 in [3] 2 , and Fact 2 is proved in the analysis of the same Theorem 2. <p> This leads to what we call the Single-Pass DME algorithm.

Fact 1 is a straightforward extension of Theorem 2 in [3] 2 , and Fact 2 is proved in the analysis of the same Theorem 2. Fact 1: For any sink set S and topology G, let S v be the set of sinks in the subtree rooted at v in the DME solution. <p> Proof: We determine the merging segments and incident edge lengths for all nodes in top-down 2 Theorem 2 in <ref> [3] </ref> states that for any sink set S and topology G, the DME algorithm will find a ZST with source-sink pathlength delay T LD (s 0 ) = diam (S)=2. 8 order as follows. Let v be a node in G with parent p (if v is not the root). <p> From Lemmas 1, 2 and 3 in <ref> [3] </ref>, we have ms (v) = core ( T T u2S v M D (l (u); r 0 ) = center (S v ), where r 0 = radius (S v ). <p> Note that under the Elmore delay model, the DME algorithm is no longer optimal: it does not necessarily return a minimum-cost ZST for given S and G <ref> [3, 5] </ref>. 5 Also, the merging segment for the root of the subtree over S 0 S in the DME solution is no longer independent of the subtree connection topology. Hence, the bottom-up DME phase cannot be eliminated, i.e., Single-Pass DME cannot be applied to the Elmore delay model.

First, any connection topology can be trivially embedded with exact zero skew onto a single routing layer; however, re-embedding the topology of a non-planar ZST (e.g., from <ref> [12] </ref>) onto a single layer can drastically increase the tree cost. The partial correspondence between linear delay and Elmore delay (at least in some technology regimes) suggests that the (optimum) Linear-Planar-DME solution can be re-embedded to have zero Elmore delay skew with very little increase in tree cost. <p> Experimentally, very limited improvements result from trying more than 16 cases. 5 Experimental Results We implemented the Linear-Planar-DME and Elmore-Planar-DME algorithms using Sun SPARC-10 workstations and the C/Unix environment.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the zero-skew clock routing problem, along with its planar variant, remains a fundamental building block in any clock distribution methodology. The first clock tree construction for cell-based layouts with arbitrary sink locations was that of Jackson et al. <ref> [16] </ref>; their MMM algorithm does recursive top-down partitioning of the set of sinks into two equal-sized subsets, always connecting the centroid of a set to the centroids of its subsets. Kahng et al. [8, 18] constructed clock tree topologies using a bottom-up matching approach. <p> However, the method basically creates an "X" clock tree, where an "H" would considerably reduce the tree cost. Khan et al. [19] have observed this deficiency, and have proposed a guaranteed-planar 6 heuristic which reduces the tree cost by applying the top-down horizontal/vertical partitioning ap-proach of <ref> [16] </ref> for a user-specified number of levels, then applying the Zhu-Dai X-tree construction within each of the resulting regions. When the user-specified number of levels is zero, the method reduces to that of Zhu-Dai.

To maintain the exact zero skew, wires are elongated via "snaking" as necessary. <p> In the last column, we also show the ZST height as a multiple of the minimum possible tree height, lg n. Table 2 compares our new algorithms with two leading non-planar ZST algorithms in the literature - Greedy-DME [12] and KCR+DME <ref> [5, 18] </ref> as well as the previous planar routing method of Zhu and Dai [25]. Greedy-DME corresponds to the CL+I6 method of Edahiro [12], and can yield an unbalanced topology. KCR+DME uses a matching approach to achieve a balanced topology [5].

Reference-contexts: Kahng et al. [8, 18] constructed clock tree topologies using a bottom-up matching approach. Their "KCR" algorithm obtains zero pathlength skew in practice (i.e., zero skew under the linear delay model) but has no theoretical guarantee. The work of Tsay <ref> [23] </ref> was the first to guarantee exact zero skew for any input; this was accomplished with respect to the Elmore delay model. In the same spirit as [18], Tsay recursively combines pairs of zero skew trees at "tapping points" to yield larger zero skew trees. <p> Thus, Linear-Planar-DME is a natural choice for generating the connection topology within our approach. 6 Second, given a Linear-Planar-DME solution, it is simple to obtain a planar Elmore-ZST by elongating tree edges in a bottom-up fashion to balance differences in sink delays (e.g., by the "snaking" method of <ref> [23] </ref>). In the experimental comparisons of Section 5 below, we call such an approach "Naive-Elmore-Planar-DME". <p> The x-coordinates and y-coordinates of Primary1 sink locations range from 120 to 5520 units and from 0 to 5790 units, respectively; those of Primary2 range from 20 to 9840 units and from 0 to 10250 units, respectively. Details of the circuit parameters for benchmarks r1-r5 can be found in <ref> [23] </ref>. Table 1 shows that our Elmore-Planar-DME implementation is relatively efficient, with run-times dominated by the generation of a good topology in the call to Linear-Planar-DME-3. Note that the Primary2 and r2 test cases have about the same number of sinks, but Primary2 leads to relatively higher runtimes.

Reference-contexts: This difficulty was first noted by Zhu and Dai <ref> [25] </ref>, who stated compelling reasons to seek a single-layer, or planar-embeddable clock routing solution. 5 * The clock routing layer may be prescribed, or we may prefer the layer with smallest RC delay. * Routing on fewer distinct layers (i.e., having fewer distinct electrical parameters) makes the layout more independent of <p> Existing work <ref> [25] </ref> implicitly relies on Euclidean planar-embeddability being sufficient for Manhattan planar-embeddability (a line segment in the Euclidean plane can be approximated to any desired accuracy by a monotone staircase in the Manhattan plane). <p> Figure 4 shows this phenomenon: four sinks that are collinear will have an optimal "planar" clock tree whose edges pass over each other. Since this overlapping can be made planar with minimum increase in wirelength, we accept such a degenerate solution as planar. This is also the convention of <ref> [25] </ref>. accept this since the ZST can be made non-overlapping with minimal increase in wirelength.

(The convex polygons P S 0 , P S 0 1 , and P S 0 2 and the points p and v pertain to the later discussion about the partitioning rules for Linear-Planar-DME.) The clock routing method of Zhu and Dai <ref> [25] </ref> was the first to guarantee a planar ZST; the solution has minimum possible source-sink pathlength, and runs in between (n log n) and O (n 2 ) time. However, the method basically creates an "X" clock tree, where an "H" would considerably reduce the tree cost. <p> When the user-specified number of levels is zero, the method reduces to that of Zhu-Dai.

The same seven examples as in <ref> [5, 12, 25] </ref> were 22 studied. Benchmarks Primary1 and Primary2 both have the same loading capacitance of 0:5pF for all sinks, and also have per-unit wire resistance and wire capacitance of 16:6m and 0:027f F , respectively. <p> Table 2 compares our new algorithms with two leading non-planar ZST algorithms in the literature - Greedy-DME [12] and KCR+DME [5, 18] as well as the previous planar routing method of Zhu and Dai <ref> [25] </ref>. Greedy-DME corresponds to the CL+I6 method of Edahiro [12], and can yield an unbalanced topology. KCR+DME uses a matching approach to achieve a balanced topology [5]. <p> Our new planar ZST solutions are competitive with the best known non-planar ZST solutions of Greedy-DME (having average 9:8% greater wiring cost), and are superior to KCR+DME solutions in all cases. Elmore-Planar-DME also uses 22:5% less wire than the (linear delay based) method of <ref> [25] </ref>. It is interesting to note that the cost of our Elmore-Planar-DME solutions is only slightly increased from the cost of the starting Linear-Planar-DME ZSTs. We believe this implies that better solutions can be obtained as we continue to improve Linear-Planar-DME. <p> Finally, Figure 15 shows ZSTs for the Primary1 benchmark constructed by Greedy-DME, Linear-Planar-DME, Elmore-Planar-DME, and the method of Zhu and Dai. 23 Greedy-DME Naive Elm- benchmark (CL+I6 [12]) Lin-Pln-DME-3 Elm-Pln-DME KCR+DME [5] Pln-DME Zhu-Dai <ref> [25] </ref> prim1 129.2 130.2 132.9 140.1 146.1 167.9 prim2 304.0 320.1 330.2 345.2 391.6 422.5 r1 1,253.3 1,351.3 1,392.8 1,487 1,686.2 1,778.3 r3 3,193.8 3,501.4 3,543.7 3,867 3,916.2 4,635.9 r5 9,723.7 10,556.2 10,806.4 11,606 12,823.3 14,119.4 Ave Cost (+0.0%) +7.2% +9.8% +17.3% +28.1% +39.4% Planar No Yes Yes No Yes Yes <p> 4,635.9 r5 9,723.7 10,556.2 10,806.4 11,606 12,823.3 14,119.4 Ave Cost (+0.0%) +7.2% +9.8% +17.3% +28.1% +39.4% Planar No Yes Yes No Yes Yes Delay Model Elmore Linear Elmore Elmore Elmore Linear Table 2: Comparison of Elmore-Planar-DME with other algorithms in terms of total wirelength, using the same benchmarks studied in <ref> [5, 12, 25] </ref>.
