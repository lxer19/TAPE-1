Reference-contexts: The general micro-architecture of the JAGUAR is given below. The JAGUAR is a one-wide dispatch, multi-issue machine with out-of-order execution capabilities. Further details of the micro-architecture is found in <ref> [1] </ref>. In order to accommodate the MULFP, modifications to the existing PUMA design included the addition of a FPR (Floating Point Register) file, changes in decode logic and changes in the ROB (ReOrder Buffer) and the dispatch Unit.
