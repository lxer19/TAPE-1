Title: Benchmark Queries for Temporal Databases  
Author: Patrick P. Kalua and Edward L Robertson 
Address: Bloomington, Indiana 47405, USA  
Affiliation: Indiana University Computer Science Department  
Abstract: This paper is intended to facilitate the development and evaluation of temporal database models by presenting semantic benchmarks with a large time component. It presents several temporal queries drawn from three application areas, and the results of some of these queries on the example relation instances. The schemas used in this paper are not based on any particular model but can be translated into most of the available temporal data models. With this in mind, it is our hope that other researchers will be able to use some of these queries as benchmarks to test their models and also as a basis for comparing different language proposals.

Reference-contexts: However, an increasing number of demographic researchers have recently developed an interest in using the group of techniques often referred at as "event history analysis" <ref> [1] </ref>. Like cross-section data, event history data describes the attributes of individuals. But additionally, event history data includes the dates at which the attributes changed.

Reference-contexts: developed to deal with two main kinds of data sources : cross-sectional survey data, which provides a snapshot description of characteristics of a set of individuals observed at a moment in time , and time series data which provides a series of observations of some aggregate unit at regular intervals <ref> [3] </ref>. However, an increasing number of demographic researchers have recently developed an interest in using the group of techniques often referred at as "event history analysis" [1]. Like cross-section data, event history data describes the attributes of individuals.

Reference-contexts: When the database model is well-defined and the goal is to compare different implementations, a performance benchmark can be used to stress-test implementations under load <ref> [4] </ref>. When there are several proposed models and the goal is to compare the descriptive and operational characteristics and capabilities of the various models, a semantic benchmark facilitates this comparison. Our benchmarks fall into the semantic category.

Reference-contexts: In other words, what units of information receive time-stamps : tuples or individual attributes ? * Temporally ungrouped <ref> [6] </ref> or First Normal Form (1NF) each tuple is augmented with some appropriate time attributes. * Temporally grouped or Non-First Normal Form (N1NF) a single (nested) tuple exists with time versions for each attribute value within the tuple.

Reference-contexts: our queries on the event history database are patterned after current literature in demographic research [1,2,3] and from the several discussions we have had with some historians and demographers at Indiana University who use event history data in their research and with whom we have been collaborating on our project <ref> [9] </ref>. Our example event history database is constructed using spells from data obtained in an employment survey of work histories of men and women 2 .

Reference-contexts: It is our hope that other researchers will use these queries as benchmarks to test their models and also as a basis for comparing different language proposals.

The number of queries has gone up by about twenty and we have also provided solutions to over fifty queries. 1.1 The Need for Benchmarks There are two major motivations for establishing benchmarks.

The TOD (and MEDLOG) databases are structured to store patient information that has been collected over the course of multiple clinic visits.

Reference-contexts: In two of the three areas we are aided by the fact that researchers in those areas have thought about their needs for temporal information [1,2,3,12,13,14,17]. 1.2 Terminology Snodgrass and Ahn <ref> [16] </ref> distinguish between two measures of time, called transaction time, the time when information is stored into the database and valid time, the time when the stored information models reality. Temporal databases are commonly categorized in two ways.
