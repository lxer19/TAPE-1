Abstract: In a series of case studies out of the field of dynamic manipulation (Mason, 1992), different principles for open loop stable con trol are in troduced and ana lyzed. This investiga tion may provide some insight into how open loop control can serve as a useful foundation for closed loop control and, par ticularly, what to focus on in learning control.

Reference-contexts: When feedback of the ball state was also provided, the focusing tra jec tory was still found, al though it emerged out of a coupled oscillator like representation in which the ball drives the paddle by some linear coupling terms <ref> (Bhler, 1990) </ref>. Particularly in the lat ter case, the paddle trajectory was clearly not a sine wave anymore. 2.2 Ball-in-a-Wedge Juggling The next juggling task constitutes a slight exten sion of the paddle juggler.

Reference-contexts: Instead of forcing a de sired trajectory or movement pattern on the system, the design goal was to find so - lutions exhibiting open loop stability. This re duces computational effort for any control sys tem and uses mechanics to help implement the task <ref> (Mason, 1992) </ref>. The Shannon juggler literally implements the task mechanically.

Reference-contexts: It is distinguished from closed loop control strate - gies by the absence of sensory input to the computing of ac - tuator commands for error compensation. Some open loop controlled devices use no actuators at all <ref> (McGeer, 1990) </ref>. As has been shown by McGeers (1990) passive dy - namic walking machines, dynamic systems are likely to of - fer regions in state and control space which are inher ently more advantageous to the ex ecution of a task then others.

The former case achieved clearly bet - ter results when implemented with an open loop throwing motion: a fixed throw pattern was triggered through sens ing the impact between hand stick and cen ter stick. Figure 11 shows a run for the steep juggling pattern.

Due to energy conserva tion, maximum stability does not go be yond neutral stability <ref> (Liouvilles theorem, Symon, 1971) </ref>. This corresponds to a Liapunov exponent of zero (note: numerical instabilities in calculating the data of Figure 6 also give some incorrect values slightly below zero). <p> However, efforts to find open loop-like schemes resulted in clearly im proved per formance of a closed loop con troller. A crucial property of movement sys tems is their loss of energy, on which all concepts of open loop stability rely. Liouville's theorem <ref> (Symon 1971) </ref> shows that con servative systems, i.e., systems which do not lose any en ergy (as in celestial physics), cannot be asymptoti cally stable; a change in energy caused by a small pertur bation persists. Therefore, dissi pation is desirable.

Reference-contexts: The gray areas denote initial con ditions belonging to the basin of attrac tion for periodic jug gling, the white areas physically impossible initial condi tions, and the black areas initial conditions which did not lead to pe ri-odic juggling <ref> (Tufillaro et al., 1992) </ref>. The numerical calculation for Figure 4 assesses the size of the basin of attraction as 0.257 of the trapping re - gion, corresponding to a probability P=0.257 that the ball 3 ends up in periodic juggling if it was initially dropped from a large enough height.
