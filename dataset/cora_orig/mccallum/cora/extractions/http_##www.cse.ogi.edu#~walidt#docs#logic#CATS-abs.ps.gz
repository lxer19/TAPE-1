Abstract: Metalanguages based on typed -calculus are a well-established tool for describing the semantics of programming languages. Among them the leading example is Scott's LCF , a predicate logic on top of a typed -calculus, which is directly inspired by the domains used in denotational semantics. LCF was introduced by Dana Scott in 1969 (see [Sco93]). Since then various issues regarding the semantic description of programming languages have become clearer: The above scenario suggests a substantial rethinking of metalanguages (and LCF in particular). We will outline a possible metalanguage, which we call LCF ++, structured in three components: and we will explain how these three components should interact. As a sample application of (a sugared version of) such a metalanguage, we will consider the incremental description of a parallel language (following the methodology proposed in [CM93]).
