Abstract: It is shown that a solution of the time-independent Ginzburg-Landau equations of superconductivity is determined completely and exactly by its values at a finite but sufficiently dense set of determining nodes in the domain. If the applied magnetic field is time dependent and asymptotically stationary, the large-time asymptotic behavior of a solution of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations of superconductivity is determined similarly by its values at a finite set of determining nodes, whose positions may vary with time.

Reference-contexts: In the latter case, we allow for a time-varying but asymptotically stationary applied magnetic field; the determining nodes themselves may also vary with time. The Ginzburg-Landau equations of superconductivity admit vortex solutions, which are characterized by singularities of the complex order parameter; see <ref> [3] </ref>. Vortex solutions are of particular interest in solid-state physics, as well as for techno 3 logical applications. It is tempting to speculate (but by no means certain) that the determining nodes are related to the vortices.
