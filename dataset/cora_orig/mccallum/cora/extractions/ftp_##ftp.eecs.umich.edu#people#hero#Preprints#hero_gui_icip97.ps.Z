Title: Robust Detection of SAR/IR Targets via Invariance

Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in automatic target recognition is reliable detection of targets in high clutter backgrounds. When the clutter statistics are unknown or highly variable, the false alarm rate of classical detection algorithms, e.g. the matched filter, cannot be controlled and target detections become unreliable. The reason for this is lack of robustness of the test statistics to clutter variations. Here we apply maximal invariants to design target detection algorithms which have constant false alarm rate yet maintain high target detection rate. Numerical comparisons will be presented for multispectral and multisnap-shot radar images which illustrate that significant gains are achievable using invariance approaches.

Reference-contexts: These two probabilities generally depend on unknown parameters 0 2 fi 0 and 1 2 fi 1 and therefore no optimal uniformly most powerful (UMP) detector generally exists. Here we use the invariance approach <ref> [1] </ref> to designing suboptimal tests. In particular, the objective will be to find detectors which are most powerful among the restricted class of CFAR (constant false alarm rate) detectors (P F A constant over fi 0 ). <p> We first consider the case of known target location, i.e. the vector b is known. In this case we can left multiply X by an n fi n unitary matrix V to put X in canonical form X = s e T where e 1 = <ref> [1; 0 : : :; 0] </ref>. Note that (m 1) fi n matrix X 2 is a clutter-only component of X. The hypotheses H 0 and H 1 correspond to fi 0 = fs = 0; R &gt; 0g; fi 1 = fs 6= 0; R &gt; 0g.

Reference-contexts: A single known 5 fi 5 synthetic "cross hair" target signature was inserted into the first subimage at an known location in an inscribed 6 fi 4 grid. We implemented three target detectors: the proposed test (3) and two versions of Kelly's GLRT <ref> [2] </ref>, one in original unstructured form and the other modified to account for the presence of the clutter boundary. By varying the thresholds on these tests and gathering empirical statistics on false alarm and detecion rates, we generated ROC curves (shown on the attached figures).
