Reference-contexts: Proposition 2. Protocol cascade is (i) effective, (ii) unforgeable under the SDL assumption, (iii) restrictive (see Proposition 1) and (iv) unconditionally blind in the sense that Bob's results from executing protocol sign are unconditionally unlinkable to Alice's views of these executions. 3 3.4 Diverted Proof of Knowledge Brands <ref> [B93] </ref> has proposed an interactive proof based on work of Chaum, Evertse and van de Graaf [CEG88] where a prover P proves to a verifier V that she knows a witness, namely a representation w = (w 1 ; : : : ; w l ) 2 ZZ q l , <p> For all l &gt; 1, this interactive proof is witness indistinguishable over the predicate family W [FS90], where W = fW q g and W q = f ( ; w)j = i=1 g w i i g. Brands has further shown in <ref> [B93] </ref> how his proof protocol can be "diverted" such that (i) P , during the interactive proof protocol with verifier V , has online access to a third party, called the co-prover Q, and ([m 0 ; 0 ] B ) cascade ([x; m] A ; [y; m; ; !] B <p> Our proposal is based upon restrictive blind signatures and a new primitive called restrictive cascade signatures. Their implementations in turn rely on the discrete log assumption. A few fundamental notions remain to be formally defined. One is restrictive blind signatures as proposed by Brands <ref> [B93] </ref>. A second is the related new primitive of restrictive cascade signatures. A third is divertibility of interactive proofs of knowledge in a more general sense than proposed by Okamoto and Ohta [OO90].

Reference-contexts: Then we present a blind signature scheme that is inspired by previous work of Schnorr [S91], Chaum, Pedersen [CP92] and Brands <ref> [B94] </ref>. Finally, we present a new interactive proof of knowledge scheme. All proofs are presented in Appendix 6.1. 3.1 Notation Since all the following protocols are based on the intractability of computing discrete representations, the following definitions are useful.

Reference-contexts: The previous proposals for personal and ballot credentials were unsatisfactory because most of them simply ignored the problem of non-transferability, e.g., Chaum [C85,CE87,C90] and Chen [C96]. Damg-ard [D90] states non-transferability as a requirement but proposes an implementation that cannot achieve it. Chaum [C92] and Brands, Chaum <ref> [BC94] </ref> address the problem partially by suggesting "distance bounding protocols" in order to ensure the physical presence of credential users' devices. Distance bounding can prevent Mafia frauds, where several individuals connect their devices online in order to virtually join all their credentials.

Reference-contexts: Another problem with Chen's proposal [C96] is its limitation to one-time credentials. In the conclusion of that work, many-time credentials based on the intractability of taking discrete logarithms are posed as an open problem. In recent years, there is increasing scientific interest in biometric person authentication <ref> [BCB97] </ref> and a growing market of biometric consumer devices|as opposed to password based solutions. But although biometric technology is on the rise, it is usually not applied in a privacy-oriented way.

Reference-contexts: Choosing an element uniformly at random from a set A and assigning it to a variable a is denoted a 2 R A. Evaluating an expression E and assigning the result to a is denoted by a left arrow a E. By h we denote a pseudo-random hash function <ref> [BR93] </ref> that, on input any binary string, returns a value in ZZ q . We relax the notation by allowing any number of arguments to h meaning that their binary representations are concatenated and then fed to h.

Reference-contexts: This concept has been introduced by Chaum and Pedersen [CP92] as the wallet with observer architecture (Fig. 2). Fig. 2. Wallet with observer architecture In the following, we are only concerned with o*ine credentials. Various cryptographic implementations have been proposed: Free credentials were given by Chaum <ref> [C85] </ref>. Personal credentials have been considered by Chaum and Evertse [C85,CE87,C90a,C92], Chen [C96] and Damg-ard [D90]. Coin credentials were suggested by Brands, Chaum, Cramer, Pedersen [CP94], and many others. <p> But although biometric technology is on the rise, it is usually not applied in a privacy-oriented way. This is what personal credentials aim at. 2 New Achievements The basic building block of many coin credential implementations is a blind signature scheme <ref> [C85] </ref>. The main idea then is to enable an owner to transform his credential for a pseudonym to a pseudonym so that the transformed credential is valid but cannot be linked to the credential issued.

Reference-contexts: In principle, the constraints on using credentials can be enforced proactively 2 or retroactively, depending on whether illegitimate use is prevented or can be identified after the fact. Proactive enforcement can be achieved either online by a central process that oversees every operation <ref> [C90] </ref>, or o*ine by equipping each individual with a personal communication device (wallet ) that can run a trusted local process (observer ) [CP92]. For example, wallets and observers could be implemented by palmtops or pilots with a built-in tamper resistant chip [PPSW97].

Reference-contexts: Protocol prove is a "diverted" and witness indistinguishable proof of knowledge over W = fW q g. 3 6 Other examples of this more general notion of divertibility of proofs of knowledge have been considered by Chen <ref> [C94] </ref>, but a formal definition is outstanding. 7 If the candidate depends only on Q's private input, e.g., as in protocol prove, then we omit from Q's input parameter list in order to avoid redundancy. ([acc] V ) prove ([v] Q ; [ ; 0 ; !; w] P ; [ <p> The main observeration is that transferability of personal and ballot credentials can only be prevented by some kind of biometric identification of the owner, and the new contribution is to do this in a privacy protecting way. In particular, we have solved the problem <ref> [C94] </ref> of using personal and ballot credentials more than once in an unlinkable way. Our proposal is based upon restrictive blind signatures and a new primitive called restrictive cascade signatures. Their implementations in turn rely on the discrete log assumption. A few fundamental notions remain to be formally defined.

Reference-contexts: The phrase "proceed iff P " with P a Boolean predicate indicates that the protocol execution proceeds if and only if P holds. Otherwise, the protocol is aborted and the participants return a corresponding exception. Polynomial composition of protocols <ref> [FS90] </ref> means to execute a given number of protocols a polynomial number of times in arbitrarily interleaved fashion. 3.2 Blind Brands-Chaum-Pedersen (BCP) Signature Scheme The signer Alice chooses her private key x 2 R ZZ q uniformly at random and publishes the corresponding public key y g x mod p. <p> For all l &gt; 1, this interactive proof is witness indistinguishable over the predicate family W <ref> [FS90] </ref>, where W = fW q g and W q = f ( ; w)j = i=1 g w i i g.

Reference-contexts: In order to identify double spending after the fact, Brands [B93,B94] suggested restricted blind signatures and Franklin, Young <ref> [FY93] </ref> had a similar concept called oblivious authentication. In both cases, the idea is to encode the owner's identity into his pseudonyms and to restrict the possible transformations so that the owner's identity is still recoverable from the pseudonym of any transformed credential should it be used twice.

In contrast to the well-defined notion of divertibility by Okamoto and Ohta <ref> [OO90] </ref>, the "diverted" proof protocol by Brands takes private input not only from the co-prover, but also from the prover, and there is no input common to all three parties, but only a semi-common input to Q and P and one to P and V . 6 We need an interactive <p> One is restrictive blind signatures as proposed by Brands [B93].

Reference-contexts: inflow of information from an organization to the observer. 1 We can generalize this property to k-time usage for any fixed k 2 IN but for our coarse categorization this is not important. 2 This is not to be confused with the proactive attacker model introduced by Ostrovsky and Yung <ref> [OY91] </ref>. Preventing outflow and inflow requires that the observer has no communication link other than to its hosting device, and all communications protocols must prevent outflow from the observer (or inflow to the observer).
