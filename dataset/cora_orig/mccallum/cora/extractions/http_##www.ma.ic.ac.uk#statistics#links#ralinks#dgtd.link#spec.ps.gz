Abstract: A Bayesian method of estimating the power spectra of stationary random processes is proposed. Initially we estimate the true spectra via the log pe-riodogram but due to the inadequacies of the periodogram when the true spectrum has a high dynamic range and/or is rapidly varying for such problems we use the multitaper spectrum estimates which have known error distributions. Piecewise polynomials with random knot locations have been used to estimate the spectra. The methodology has been successful in giving "smooth" estimates which also capture peaks and troughs in the true spectra.

Reference-contexts: So the problem of routine calculation of posterior distributions for both the number and location of knots as well as the polynomial coefficients is addressed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation technique of reversible jumps <ref> (Green, 1995) </ref>. In the previous analysis we use the periodogram estimates as our raw data. But the periodogram provides poor spectral estimates especially when the true spectrum has high dynamic range and/or is rapidly varying. <p> form p (k; (k) jy) = p (kjy)p ( (k) jk; y): (11) We will generate samples from the joint posterior of (k; (k) ) (as in these non-trivial cases of changing dimension the standard MCMC theory does not apply) by using a wider class of reversible jumps Metropolis-Hastings algorithms <ref> (Green, 1995) </ref>. Full details of these methods can be found in the references cited. Here, we focus on the essence of the methodology and the particular forms of the algorithms in our current context. We first write down the Bayesian model.

Reference-contexts: This method is very sensitive to the choice of bandwidths and usually performs poorly in cases of high dynamic range. (b) Autoregressive (Moving Average) spectral estimation, <ref> (Parzen, 1974) </ref>: Usually a high order AR, MA or ARMA model is fitted using Yule-Walker or Burg algorithms. The critical parameter here is the order of the autoregres-sion, usually chosen using a stopping criterion such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

Reference-contexts: But the periodogram provides poor spectral estimates especially when the true spectrum has high dynamic range and/or is rapidly varying. In these cases we need to start with a better spectrum estimator such as the multitaper spectrum estimator <ref> (Percival and Walden, 1993) </ref>. To do this we replace the log periodogram with the log of the multitaper spectrum estimate, then the estimates become less biased but more correlated; also the errors become normally distributed.

Reference-contexts: But I (!) is not a consistent estimate of f (!) and most of the times wiggly, even if f (!) is smooth. The most popular methods for estimating the spectral density are: (a) Window methods, <ref> (Priestley, 1981) </ref>: A spectral window (weight function) is used to smooth the periodogram.
