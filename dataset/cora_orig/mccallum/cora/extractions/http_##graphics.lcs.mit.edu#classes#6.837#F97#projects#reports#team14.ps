Title: Real-Time Interactive Manipulation of Objects in a Ray Traced Scene

Abstract: Traditional ray tracing provides an impressive degree of realism in computer generated images by simulating the behavior of light. However, it is highly computationally expensive precluding most real-time applications. Attempts at real-time rendering have led to alternative methods, sacrificing quality for speed. This paper presents a method for rendering ray-traced images in real time. This is made possible through the use of data that is pre-calculated in a separate non-time-critical phase. This limits the application to scenes of a static environment with an arbitrarily complex geometry, and dynamic objects that are relatively simple. The task is divided into two steps: the setup phase in which all the pre-computation is accomplished and the real-time phase in which the interactivity takes place. The setup phase involves rendering the environment via a variation on traditional ray tracing such that much more data about the scene is saved. The real-time phase then utilizes this pre-computed data to eliminate a majority of the computation normally associated with ray tracing (i.e. ray generation, shading calculations.) while preserving the high quality. The presented method trades pre-computation overhead and flexibility for speed increases on the order of thousands in render time, making it possible to render ray traced scenes in real-time. Without accelerated graphics hardware, we were able to obtain reasonable frame rates on a Pentium 200. These results indicate that this method could soon become useful for a large range of applications.
