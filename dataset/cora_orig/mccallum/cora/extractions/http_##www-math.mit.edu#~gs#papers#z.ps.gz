Abstract: To study wavelets and filter banks of high order, we begin with the zeros of B p (y). This is the binomial series for (1 y) p , truncated after p terms. Its zeros give the p 1 zeros of the Daubechies filter inside the unit circle, by z + z 1 = 2 4y. The filter has p additional zeros at z = 1, and this construction makes it orthogonal and maximally flat. The dilation equation leads to orthogonal wavelets with p vanishing moments. Symmetric biorthogonal wavelets (generally better in image compression) come similarly from a subset of the zeros of B p (y). We study the asymptotic behavior of these zeros. Matlab shows a remarkable plot for p = 70. The zeros approach a limiting curve j4y(1 y)j = 1 in the complex plane, which is jz z 1 j = 2. All zeros have jyj 1=2, and the rightmost zeros approach y = 1=2 (corresponding to z = i ) with speed p 1=2 . The curve j4y(1 y)j = (4p) 1=2p j1 2yj 1=p gives a very accurate approximation for finite p. The wide dynamic range in the coefficients of B p (y) makes the zeros difficult to compute for large p. Rescaling y by 4 allows us to reach p = 80 by standard codes. This is "spectral factorization" of high order. The zeros at z = 1 stabilize the iteration of the filter in a multiresolution.

Reference-contexts: Then all zeros of p (y) must lie in the closed annulus: min i r i jyj max i r i . The details about when and how the zeros can really lie on the border of the prescribed annulus is discussed by Anderson, Saff, and Varga <ref> [1] </ref>. Their sharpened form gives the strict inequality jY j &lt; 1=2 for p &gt; 2. Proof of Theorem 2. By (1), B p (y) satisfies the condition of the EK Theorem. And in this case, r i = (i + 1)=(p + i) for 0 i p 2.

Reference-contexts: We now explain how the zeros of B p (y) are connected to the coefficients h (n) that generate Daubechies wavelets.

The Daubechies wavelets have orthogonality but not symmmetry. The translates and dilates w (2 j t k) are an orthogonal basis for L 2 (R).

Reference-contexts: Then Theorem 5 would give j4Y (1 Y )j = j1 W 2 p 1 + O (p 2 )j = 1 + O (p 2 ) This contradicts the inequality j4Y (1 Y )j &gt; 2 1=p in Theorem 2, proving the corollary.

They also proved an asymptotic form of the statement jarg W j 3=4. <p> In this region, the error order in equation (20) rises to p 1 .

A change of variables t = (1 cos )=2 in (24) produces the integral of sin 2p1 .

Reference-contexts: A polynomial with repeated roots leads to a defective matrix (not diagonalizable). Algorithms based on Newton's method had difficulty with the accurate evaluation of B p and B 0 p . Lang's algorithm (Lang and Frenzel <ref> [4] </ref>) is comparable to Matlab `roots', and probably faster. We now explain how the zeros of B p (y) are connected to the coefficients h (n) that generate Daubechies wavelets. It is important to note that the same zeros also lead to 2 biorthogonal filters and symmetric wavelets (cf.

Reference-contexts: For p = 2, the only zero is Y = 1=2. For p &gt; 2 all the zeros satisfy jY j &lt; 1=2. Therefore each Z has Re (Z) &gt; 0. Before proving it, we need a theorem due to Enestrom and Kakeya (cf. Marden <ref> [5] </ref>): EK Theorem. Let p (y) be a polynomial of degree n with all coefficients a i real and positive. Define r i = a i =a i+1 , 0 i n 1.

Reference-contexts: The limits of intergration are related by y = (1cos )=2, which is exactly the change associated with z = e i! in the proof of Theorem 1. Thus (24) is Meyer's form (cf. Meyer <ref> [6] </ref>, page 43) of the halfband filter P (z) in equation (6) P (e i! ) = 1 c 1 Z ! sin 2p1 d: (28) The zero at y = 1 becomes the celebrated "zero at " for the frequency response P (e i! ).

Reference-contexts: The outstanding contribution to problems of this type was by Szego <ref> [8] </ref> in 1924, who studied the truncation of the exponential series. His limiting curve was jze 1z j = 1, when the zeros are divided by p.

Reference-contexts: Now we describe more precisely the location of the zeros of B p (y). As in Szego's problem for the exponential series (see the new methods and additional results in Varga <ref> [9] </ref>), there are two regions to consider: near y = 1=2 and away from y = 1=2. Suppose D is a circle around y = 1=2, with fixed small radius ffi. Theorem 5 studies the zeros inside D, and Theorem 4 studies the zeros outside.
