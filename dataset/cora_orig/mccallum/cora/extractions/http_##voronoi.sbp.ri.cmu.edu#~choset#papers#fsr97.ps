Abstract: Coverage path planning is the determination of a path that a robot must take in order to pass over each point in an environment. Applications include vacuuming, floor scrubbing, and inspection. We developed the boustrophedon cellular decomposition, which is an exact cellular decomposition approach, for the purposes of coverage. Each cell in the boustrophedon is covered with simple back and forth motions. Once each cell is covered, then the entire environment is covered. Therefore, coverage is reduced to finding an exhaustive path through a graph which represents the adjacency relationships of the cells in the boustrophedon decomposition. This approach is provably complete and Experiments on a mobile robot validate this approach.

Reference-contexts: Typically, this is called a critical point, which are used in roadmap motion planning techniques such as Canny and Lin's "Opportunistic Path Planner" (OPP) <ref> [ Canny and Lin, 1990 ] </ref> , [ Canny and Lin, 1993 ] , which is itself based on Canny's Roadmap Algorithm [ Canny, 1988 ] . Now, the robot can perform coverage in curved, or even sampled, environments.

Again, a slice sweeps through a bounded planar environment populated with polygonal obstacles.

Reference-contexts: Once a robot covers each cell, it has covered the entire free region of an environment. This approach has been validated with simulations and a Nomadic 200 mobile robot base. 2 Background Work 2.1 Prior Work in Coverage Previous work in coverage include applications such as vacuum cleaning <ref> [ Colegrave and Branch, 1994 ] </ref> and floor cleaning. In these approaches, the path must be ex plicitly programmed into the robot; i.e., they do not use an algorithm to generate the coverage path, but instead prescribe one "by hand." Furthermore, these algorithms rely on landmarks deployed in the environment.
