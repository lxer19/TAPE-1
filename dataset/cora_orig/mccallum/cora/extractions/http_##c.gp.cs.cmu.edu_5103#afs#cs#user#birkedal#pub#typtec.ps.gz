Abstract: Partial equivalence relations (and categories of these) are a standard tool in semantics of type theories and programming languages, since they often provide a cartesian closed category with extended defin-ability. Using the theory of exact categories, we give a category-theoretic explanation of why the construction of a category of partial equivalence relations often produces a cartesian closed category. We show how several familiar examples of categories of partial equivalence relations fit into the general framework.

Reference-contexts: See also [37] which obtains independently the same result with a rather different, non-elementary proof. 3 Defining exact categories In order to recall the definition of an exact category from <ref> [8] </ref>, we must introduce some preliminary notions in a category with pullbacks: an equivalence relation is a pair of parallel maps X 1 r 1 - - X 0 which is (i) jointly monic: for every x; y: Z - X 1 , if r 1 x = r 1 y <p> It is said to be effective if its kernel pair is isomorphic to the given equivalence relation. It is stable if any pullback of it is a quotient. In the category of sets, all quotients are effective and stable but this fails in many other categories. 3.1 DEFINITION (see <ref> [8] </ref>) A category is called exact if it has finite limits and stable effective quotients of equivalence relations.

(In the set-theoretic intuition, a regular projective is a set for which choice principle holds.) 3.4 THEOREM (see <ref> [11] </ref>) An exact category E is a free completion if and only if the full subcategory on the regular projectives of E is closed under finite limits, and every object E of E is the target of a quotient map from a regular projective. <p> Proof: It follows immediately from the property of the respective categories of regular projectives, also for the last case since Eff PartAsm ex , see <ref> [11, 36] </ref>. <p> On the topological side, since Top has stable disjoint sums, these are inherited by Top ex , see <ref> [11] </ref>, which is therefore a locally cartesian closed pretopos. This result is new and of importance to topology.

Reference-contexts: The presentation of the regular projectives in the effective topos as partitioned assemblies gives another example.

Similarly, taking the elements of M as the inclusions in PartAsm (and E accordingly), the category PER (PartAsm; M) is equivalent to the category of assemblies, see <ref> [12] </ref>.

A non-expert can simply read the two state ments in this section and continue to the next. <p> Using the result at the previous point, the conclusion follows.

Reference-contexts: Note that in an exact category, every map can be factored as a quotient followed by a mono. In fact, one shows that quotients and monos form a stable factorization system, see <ref> [19] </ref>. Moreover, there are coequal izers also for pseudo-equivalence relations: a parallel pair X 1 r 1 - - X 0 which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive (pseudo because it may fail to satisfy the jointly-monic condition from the definition of an equivalence relation). <p> Recall from <ref> [19] </ref> that a stable factorization system is such that every map in C can be factored as a composite of a map in E and one in M, that these collections are closed under pullbacks, and that they are orthogonal: there exists a unique diagonal filling in every commutative square such

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Partial equivalence relations (and categories of these) are a standard tool in semantics of programming languages, see e.g. <ref> [2, 5, 7, 9, 15, 17, 20, 22, 35] </ref> and [6, 29] for extensive surveys. They are usefully applied to give proofs of correctness and adequacy since they often provide a cartesian closed category with additional properties.

Reference-contexts: Also, in the process one sees that the exact completion of the category of (all) topological spaces and the effective topos (which is an exact completion of a category with finite limits, see <ref> [36] </ref>) share many similarities. In particular, they are both cartesian closed pretoposes for the same general reason. In particular, one also obtains a solution to a long standing problem in categorical topology of embedding the category of topological spaces into an exact cartesian closed category. <p> Proof: It follows immediately from the property of the respective categories of regular projectives, also for the last case since Eff PartAsm ex , see <ref> [11, 36] </ref>.

In particular, one also obtains a solution to a long standing problem in categorical topology of embedding the category of topological spaces into an exact cartesian closed category. See also <ref> [37] </ref> which obtains independently the same result with a rather different, non-elementary proof. 3 Defining exact categories In order to recall the definition of an exact category from [8], we must introduce some preliminary notions in a category with pullbacks: an equivalence relation is a pair of parallel maps X 1
