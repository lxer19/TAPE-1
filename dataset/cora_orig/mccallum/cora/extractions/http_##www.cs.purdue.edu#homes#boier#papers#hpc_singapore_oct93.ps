Abstract: A typical computing environment for solving Grand Challenge Problems consists of a high performance graphics workstation acting as a front-end, connected to a variety of remote supercomputers. A Problem Solving Environment (PSE) is a system of programs designed to assist a scientist in solving his/her problems without detailed understanding of parallel machines, and guiding him/her through the maze of computing options and mountains of data. A PSE for Structural Biology, SB, is under development at Purdue University to aid biologists manage such computations. This paper discusses the functions supported by SB and proposes it as a generic model for such environments.

Reference-contexts: There are many simple rules to assist the biologists or automate completely the selection. The database also contains historical data collected by SB and the characteristics of the current computations can be compared to previous ones. This methodology is described in detail in <ref> [Hou 91] </ref>, [Hou 94] for another application area.
