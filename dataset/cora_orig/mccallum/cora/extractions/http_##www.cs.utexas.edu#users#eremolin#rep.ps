Title: A Kalman Filter for Wall Following  
Author: Emilio Remolina 
Date: November 6, 1997  
Abstract: We have implemented a wall following control law which takes its input signal from a kalman filter. The kalman filter comprises a wall model as well as the control law dynamics. The benefits of using this kalman filter approach include: (i) the effect of sensor's noise on the control law is lessen, (ii) a compromise between the control's law operational conditions 1 and the actual environment is achieved, (iii) reliable methods can be implemented to detect when the control law should no longer be executed. We propose a system architecture that allows to detect inconsistences between the environment and the kalman filter's dynamic and measurement models. We develop a strategy for a smooth change to a new wall model (if possible), whenever the current wall model is no longer valid.

Reference-contexts: We are planning to use the methods presented in this paper to implement more complex trajectory-following control law (for example, a middle-line following behavior) as well as add the use of Kalman Filters for autonomous learn behaviors as presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. In addition, we would like to adapt the RCD's methods presented in [3] in order to detect the end of a control law.

Reference-contexts: When various consecutive qualitative changes in the corrections are detected, the end of the control law is signaled. Next we explain how this is done. 7 This window correspond to the validation gate used in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 The Kalman's filter update rule has the form x t = x fl t ) where x t denotes the state of the system at time t, x fl t is the dynamic's model projected state at time t, K is the kalman gain, r is the current measurement, <p> The current robot cannot rotate in small angles 10 commanded by the control law. When using raw sonar reading, these differences are due to sonar noise and translational odometry errors when taking the readings used to calculate the orientation. 5 Related work Leonard and Durrant-White <ref> [3] </ref> present an extensive use of Kalman Filters for mobile robot navigation using sonar. After pointing out the main characteristics of sonar, they introduce the notion of regions of constant depth (RCD) as a qualitative representation of the information content in a sonar scan. <p> In addition, they are used for map building by matching multiple RCDs observed from different locations based on different target assumptions. Next we summarize some of 10 angles in the interval (-0.1,0.1) the main points in <ref> [3] </ref> related to the methods presented in this paper. 1. In [3], targets (i.e. walls, edges, corners, etc.) are represented with respect to a global frame of coordinates. A local frame of coordinates suffices for our wall-following control law. 2. <p> In addition, they are used for map building by matching multiple RCDs observed from different locations based on different target assumptions.

Reference-contexts: Previous implementations of this control law calculated the values of e and directly from sonar readings (see <ref> [4] </ref>). In these implementations, heuristics were use to deal with sonar noise, specially with sonar's specular reflection. In this report, we describe the use of a kalman filter in order to calculate the current values of e and .
