Title: Compact Roundtrip Routing for Digraphs  
Author: Lenore J. Cowen Christopher G. Wagner

Abstract: n log 2 n)-sized routing tables on average at each node, and the second achieves O(n 2=3 log 4=3 n)-sized routing tables maximum space at every node. Both schemes use O(log n) bit vertex addresses and achieve roundtrip routes of stretch at most 3 compared to the optimal roundtrip shortest paths in any strongly connected weighted or unweighted digraph.

Reference-contexts: The compact routing problem instead considers a tradeoff of route lengths for space, in the setting where each node locally stores its own routing tables. Much recent work has been done on fast constructions of approximate shortest paths (see <ref> [1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 10] </ref>) and on compact routing schemes with sublinear maximum or average space (see [3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 14]) for undirected weighted and unweighted graphs.
