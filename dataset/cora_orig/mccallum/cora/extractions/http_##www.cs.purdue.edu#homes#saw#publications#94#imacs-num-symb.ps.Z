Reference-contexts: In this report, we describe our experience with developing a software environment that supports the convenient and ubiquitous interaction of these two (and other) computing methodologies. The next section provides a broad overview of the PDELab project <ref> [1] </ref>, the larger context to which this work belongs. Section 3 highlights the integrated use of symbolic computation in PDELab and the following section describes the software environment that facilitates this. 2.

Reference-contexts: This layer is responsible for the integration of various software components to form integrated workbenches and facilitate the development of these components as well. The communication fabric that supports component integration is based on the software bus model <ref> [2] </ref>. The software bus concept is an attempt to emulate the hardware bus mechanism that provides a standard hardware interface to attach additional capabilities to a machine.

Reference-contexts: Symbolic transformations on PDESpec objects (for example, linearizing a nonlinear equation or discretizing a PDE operator) are also supported. When a PDESpec program is to be executed, a translator in MACSYMA symbolically analyzes the program and generates the target code using the GENCRAY code generation system <ref> [3] </ref>. Execution time discretizations (for example, discretizing continuous boundary conditions to generate discrete values at boundary points) are done using MACSYMA as an evaluation server.
