Abstract: The MEME algorithm extends the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for identifying motifs in unaligned biopolymer sequences. The aim of MEME is to discover new motifs in a set of biopolymer sequences where little or nothing is known in advance about any motifs that may be present. MEME innovations expand the range of problems which can be solved using EM and increase the chance of finding good solutions. First, subsequences which actually occur in the biopolymer sequences are used as starting points for the EM algorithm to increase the probability of finding globally optimal motifs. Second, the assumption that each sequence contains exactly one occurrence of the shared motif is removed. This allows multiple appearances of a motif to occur in any sequence and permits the algorithm to ignore sequences with no appearance of the shared motif, increasing its resistance to noisy data. Third, a method for probabilistically erasing shared motifs after they are found is incorporated so that several distinct motifs can be found in the same set of sequences, both when different motifs appear in different sequences and when a single sequence may contain multiple motifs. Experiments show that MEME can discover both the CRP and LexA binding sites from a set of sequences which contain one or both sites, and that MEME can discover both the 10 and 35 promoter regions in a set of E. coli sequences.

Reference-contexts: The information content of the model is thus defined as I model = W X I j : The relationship between I model and log (likelihood ) is discussed by Stormo [18] and Bailey <ref> [1] </ref>. 3. Promoter sequences are DNA sequences that precede genes and are necessary for the tran scription of DNA to messenger RNA. 4. The consensus sequence of a motif is the sequence consisting of the most commonly occurring letter in each position of the appearances of the motif.

Reference-contexts: Supervised learning is often done by humans rather than by software, because it is an open-ended problem that is harder than searching. For example, the prosite profiles were created by Amos Bairoch by personally examining families of proteins <ref> [2] </ref>. An unsupervised learning tool takes as input a set of sequences, and discovers a pattern that some of the sequences share. Unsupervised learning is harder than supervised learning because the space of possible patterns is much larger.

Reference-contexts: It is also described in detail below. An overview of the contents of the datasets is given in Table 1. The CRP dataset is taken from Stormo and Hartzell [19] who, in turn, derived it from Berg and von Hippel <ref> [3] </ref> and de Crombrugghe et al. [6]. It contains 18 DNA fragments from E. coli each believed to contain one or more CRP binding sites. The dataset contains 18 CRP binding sites which had been verified by DNase protection experiments when the dataset was compiled.

Reference-contexts: It may be possible to use the multiple models learned by MEME on passes through the dataset as features for another learning algorithm. For example, a decision tree learner such as ID3 [15] or CART <ref> [4] </ref> could use the models learned by MEME on the promoter dataset as features to learn a classification rule for E. coli promoters. Since the first two passes of MEME found models for the 10 and 35 regions of the promoter, this approach should have a high chance of success.

Reference-contexts: The correct model for the shared motif is expected to be the model which globally maximizes the likelihood function, but EM is not guaranteed to find the global maximum, only a local maximum. Previous UNSUPERVISED LEARNING OF MULTIPLE MOTIFS IN BIOPOLYMERS USING EM 57 authors ([14], <ref> [5] </ref>) have recommended using several starting points for EM and choosing the model with the highest likelihood, but how to choose the starting points has not been discussed in detail. <p> One of the samples in the LexA dataset overlaps a sample in the CRP dataset. The overlap includes the known CRP site. The promoter dataset is taken from Cardon and Stormo <ref> [5] </ref>. It contains 231 E. coli DNA fragments each believed to contain promoter regions. This dataset was originally compiled by Harley and Reynolds [9], and contained 288 fragments, but Cardon and Stormo omitted a number of fragments that were from highly redundant sequences or known to be mutant promoters.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that expectation maximization algorithms find values for the model parameters at which the likelihood function assumes a local maximum <ref> [7] </ref>. It is reasonable to assume that the correct solution to the problem of characterizing the shared motif occurs at the global maximum of the likelihood function.

Reference-contexts: MEME discovered the LexA binding site on its first pass and the CRP binding site on its second pass. The second dataset contained 231 E. coli promoter sequences <ref> [9] </ref>. 3 MEME discovered the TATAAT and TTGACA consensus sequences 4 on the first and second passes, respectively. This demonstrates the ability of MEME to avoid local optima, to tolerate large number of sequences which do not contain the motif, and to find multiple motifs in a single dataset. 2. <p> The overlap includes the known CRP site. The promoter dataset is taken from Cardon and Stormo [5]. It contains 231 E. coli DNA fragments each believed to contain promoter regions. This dataset was originally compiled by Harley and Reynolds <ref> [9] </ref>, and contained 288 fragments, but Cardon and Stormo omitted a number of fragments that were from highly redundant sequences or known to be mutant promoters. <p> All the fragments roughly comprise positions 50 to +10 with respect to the start of transcription. 8 Previous work such as that of Harley and Reynolds <ref> [9] </ref> has shown that the promoter motif seems to consist of two highly conserved sub-motifs of width 6 each, separated by a variable-length spacer. The spacer is usually 15, 16, 17 or 18 bases long.

Reference-contexts: Another promising idea is to use the short motifs learned by MEME to construct starting points for hidden Markov models. The innovations added to the EM algorithm in MEME can also be used with hidden Markov models (HMMs) <ref> [10] </ref>. The idea of using subsequence-derived starting points may be adaptable for use with HMMs. The method used by MEME for probabilistically erasing sites after each pass would certainly be easy to add to the standard forward/backward HMM learning algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Several methods have been presented in the literature which work on problems related to discovering multiple, distinct shared motifs in a set of biological sequences. The purpose of this research is to extend the range of problems that can be attacked. Hertz et al. <ref> [11] </ref> presented a greedy algorithm for discovering a single, shared motif that is present once in each of a set of sequences. Lawrence and Reilly [14] extended that work by developing an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for solving the same problem. <p> The MEME algorithm with the n-per model was tested on two datasets. The first was a dataset combining 18 E. coli sequences containing CRP binding sites [14] and 16 sequences containing LexA binding sites <ref> [11] </ref>. MEME discovered the LexA binding site on its first pass and the CRP binding site on its second pass. The second dataset contained 231 E. coli promoter sequences [9]. 3 MEME discovered the TATAAT and TTGACA consensus sequences 4 on the first and second passes, respectively. <p> Each fragment in the dataset contains 105 bases and the fragments are not aligned with each other in any particular way. The LexA dataset is taken from Table I in <ref> [11] </ref>. It contains 16 DNA fragments each believed to contain one or more LexA binding sites. The dataset contains 11 LexA binding sites which had been verified by DNase protection experiments when the dataset was compiled. <p> MEME prints the consensus (i.e., the most probable letter for each position in the motif as determined from ) after each pass. The consensus after pass 1 was UNSUPERVISED LEARNING OF MULTIPLE MOTIFS IN BIOPOLYMERS USING EM 63 TACTGTATATATATACAGTA, which matches the consensus reported by <ref> [11] </ref> and is a perfect DNA palindrome.

The CRP samples are the short curves at the top. <p> The recN sample contains three LexA binding sites whose left ends are marked on the horizontal axis of the figure. The peaks in the curve occur at or near these positions. The same phenomenon was observed for the other LexA samples, except for himA and uvrC which previous researchers <ref> [11] </ref> have noted do not match the LexA consensus 4.2. "Erasing" one motif is necessary to find another On closer inspection of the plots, peaks could also be seen in the curves from the CRP samples at positions corresponding to known CRP binding sites. <p> MEME discovered CRP sites in the colicin Ia and colicin Ib samples. The site in colicin Ib was mentioned in [21] as being either a LexA site or possibly a CRP site. <ref> [11] </ref> appear to have classified it as a LexA site.

The MEME algorithm with the n-per model was tested on two datasets.

MEME discovered the LexA binding site on its first pass and the CRP binding site on its second pass. <p> This demonstrates the ability of MEME to avoid local optima, to tolerate large number of sequences which do not contain the motif, and to find multiple motifs in a single dataset. 2. The MEME algorithm The MEME algorithm has at its core a modified version of the EM algorithm <ref> [14] </ref>. The pseudo-code for the algorithm is given below. In the inner loop, an algorithm 56 TIMOTHY L. BAILEY AND CHARLES ELKAN based on the EM algorithm is run repeatedly with different starting points for the chosen model (either one-per model or n-per model). <p> Dealing with multiple appearances of a shared motif MEME allows the user to specify that either the one-per model or the n-per model be used. With the one-per model, MEME uses the EM algorithm of Lawrence and Reilly <ref> [14] </ref> to fit the model to the dataset. To fit the n-per model, a heuristic modification of the EM algorithm is used. The one-per model assumes that each sequence in the dataset contains exactly one appearance of the shared motif to be characterized. <p> On the next pass, MEME discovers the CRP motif. The consensus sequence it reports for pass 2 is TTTTTTGATCGGTTTCACAC, which agrees well with the consensus found with one-per model and reported in <ref> [14] </ref>. More significantly, the model char acterizes the CRP motif well, judging from the values of z ij for the various positions in the samples in the dataset. Table 4 shows the values of z ij found during pass 2 on the CRP/LexA dataset. According to [14], the CRP dataset contains <p> model and reported in <ref> [14] </ref>. More significantly, the model char acterizes the CRP motif well, judging from the values of z ij for the various positions in the samples in the dataset. Table 4 shows the values of z ij found during pass 2 on the CRP/LexA dataset. According to [14], the CRP dataset contains 24 known CRP binding sites, 18 of which had been verified by protection experiments. The value of z ij for eight of these is above 0.99 in the model, while eleven have z ij values above 0.1. <p> Bases preceding the start of transcription are given negative numbers, starting at -1, with 0 not used.) 9. If the best value of W is not known in advance, MEME can be run repeatedly with different values. <ref> [14] </ref> addresses the question of choosing the best value of W . Each run of MEME uses a single value of W for all motifs found.

Reference-contexts: It should also be possible to design a HMM which, like the n-per model, eliminates the assumption of one motif per sequence.

MEME discovered CRP sites in the colicin Ia and colicin Ib samples. The site in colicin Ib was mentioned in [21] as being either a LexA site or possibly a CRP site.
