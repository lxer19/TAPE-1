Abstract: In this paper we report on experiments using WordNet synset tags to evaluate the semantic properties of the verb classes cataloged by Levin (1993). This paper represents ongoing research begun at the University of Pennsylvania (Rosenzweig and Dang, 1997; Palmer, Rosenzweig, and Dang, 1997) and the University of Maryland (Dorr and Jones, 1996b; Dorr and Jones, 1996a; Dorr and Jones, 1996c). Using WordNet sense tags to constrain the intersection of Levin classes, we avoid spurious class intersections introduced by homonymy and polysemy (run a bath, run a mile). By adding class intersections based on a single shared sense-tagged word, we minimize the impact of the non-exhaustiveness of Levin's database (Dorr and Olsen, 1996; Dorr, To appear). By examining the syntactic properties of the intersective classes, we provide a clearer picture of the relationship between WordNet/EuroWordNet and the LCS interlingua for machine translation and other NLP applications.

Reference-contexts: The only property given for the Verbs of Rushing is the fact that all can be used transitively in the causative construction (Her sister hurried. Maggie hurried her sister.). Among other properties, the Run verbs participate in the Induced Action Alternation, a type of causative <ref> (Levin, 1993, p. 31) </ref>. <p> This suggests that the Verbs of Rushing are a subclass of the Run verbs that is semantically rather than syntactically described: the Verbs of Rushing "describe doing something quickly" and the Run verbs "describe the manners in which animate entities can move" <ref> (Levin, 1993, pp. 271, 267) </ref>. <p> They suggest reflecting the Levin-WordNet mapping more directly by removing the type of polysemy encoded by the in-tersective classes.

Reference-contexts: They derive 129 additional classes from Levin, using sets of classes that shared at least three verb tokens. The three-member threshold ensured systematic relations between classes, rather than spurious intersections due to homonymy or polysemy. This prevented e.g., draw (water) and draw (a picture) from creating an intersective class <ref> (Rosenzweig and Dang, 1997) </ref>. They used these intersective sets, hand-tagged with WordNet senses, to investigate the relationship between WordNet and Levin for two classes: 21.1 Cut verbs and 23.2 Split verbs. <p> the use illustrated here, each of these verbs manifests an extended sense which might be paraphrased `separate by V-ing,' where 'V' is the basic meaning of that verb." blow, break, cut, draw, hack, hew, kick, knock, pry, pull, push, rip, roll, saw, shove, slip, tug, yank (3) 21.1 and 23.2 <ref> (Rosenzweig and Dang, 1997) </ref> cut, hack, hew, saw The results of our experiments (specifically 3 below) suggest chop as a po tential additional member: * Experiment 1: any senses of a given word overlap 21.1 and 23.2: cut 1, hack 1, hew 1, hew 2, saw 1 * Experiment 2: all
