A few minor editing changes have been made since then, and one reference to a paper that did not yet exist at that time has been added.

Reference-contexts: A useful characterization of distributions on the sphere is presented in Beran <ref> [Bera79] </ref>. Beran considers exponential distributions on the sphere, that is, distributions of the form expfP g where P is a polynomial evaluated over the surface of the sphere.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the low order approximation to any antipodally symmetric exponential distribution on the sphere is of the form expfY 2 g. A distribution having this form has already been studied in the statistical literature, where it is called Bingham's distribution <ref> [Bing74] </ref>. Bingham's distribution can be described as a trivariate Gaussian vector with zero mean and arbitrary covariance matrix, conditioned on the length of the vector being unity.

Reference-contexts: A general-purpose algorithm for vanishing point analysis therefore needs to be able to handle clusters of vanishing point estimates centered around points at infinity <ref> [Coll90a] </ref>. Since the projective plane is topologically closed, it is better to think of it as a closed 2D space like the surface of a sphere. <p> Bingham's distribution has been used previously in a computer vision setting to represent uncertainties in line and plane orientations estimated from vanishing point analysis and stereo line correspondences <ref> [Coll90b, Coll90a] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This backprojection lies at the core of model extension work by Mohr [Mohr91, Mohr90] and Collins <ref> [Coll92] </ref>. Unfortunately, some camera images are dominated by nonlinear lens distortions, and any analysis based on projective transformations becomes invalid. Under radial distortion, for instance, the images of colinear points may no longer be colinear, and the corresponding plane to plane mapping is no longer a homography. <p> Bingham's distribution has been used previously in a computer vision setting to represent uncertainties in line and plane orientations estimated from vanishing point analysis and stereo line correspondences [Coll90b, Coll90a]. An application of Bingham's distribution to projective model extension is presented in <ref> [Coll92] </ref>, where maximum likelihood estimation is used to fuse clusters of homogeneous coordinate estimates. 6 4 Towards Nonplanar Reconstructions Up to this point in the discussion, it has been assumed that the scene is either planar, or is viewed from far enough away that it appears planar. <p> Consideration of antipodally symmetric probability distributions on the sphere identified Bingham's distribution as a first-order approximation to any probability distribution in the projective plane. In <ref> [Coll92] </ref>, data fusion in the projective plane is performed using maximum likelihood estimation on samples from Bingham density clusters. The second deviation from a pure projective geometry setting that was considered in this paper was an analysis of how noncoplanar points are transformed under a homography.

Reference-contexts: least four point or line correspondences between the two views can be found, a projective transformation mapping the second image into the coordinate frame of the first can be computed, allowing the oblique view to be effectively "unwarped" into registration with the initial nadir view (for an alternative approach, see <ref> [Coll93] </ref>). extracted image line segments. One real-world issue becomes immediately apparent from this example. If ideal features were being transformed between the two images, corresponding features would overlap exactly in the final registered mosaic.

Faugeras and Lustman present a least squares approach to homography estimation <ref> [Faug88] </ref>. Each finite point to point correspondence supplies two constraints on the eight independent parameters to be estimated.

Reference-contexts: In the remainder of this paper nonlinear camera parameters are neglected; when such lens distortions are nonnegligable a preprocessing step must be performed to remove their effects <ref> [Gros90] </ref>. 2.2 Estimation of a homography The fundamental theorem of projective geometry states that a plane to plane homography is completely determined by the correspondences of four points, no three of which are colinear.

Reference-contexts: In actuality, the pinhole camera model does not adequately characterize images produced by real cameras. If the deviation of a particular camera from the pinhole model is governed by linear camera calibration parameters, the resulting image is an affine transformation of the pure pinhole projection <ref> [Horn86] </ref>. These transformations are labeled C 1 and 2 C 2 in the figure. Affine transformations are a subgroup of the homography group, and the composition of a pinhole perspectivity followed by an affine deformation yields yet another homography.

Reference-contexts: This assumption is not as restrictive as it seems, since any strictly positive function F on the sphere can be represented as expflnfF gg. One good reason for considering exponential distributions is their ease of use in maximum likelihood estimation <ref> [Mend87] </ref>. Assuming a distribution of the form expfP g, Beran notes that the polynomial P can be decomposed using spherical harmonics, analogous to the way polynomials in Euclidean space are decomposed using Fourier analysis. If the distribution is required to have antipodal symmetry, all odd order harmonics are identically zero.

For a more comprehensive discussion of projective transformations, the reader is invited to consult a projective geometry text <ref> [Spri64] </ref>. 2.1 Homographies A general projective transformation between planes can be written algebraically as X 0 = gX + hY + i dX + eY + f (1) where (X; Y ) and (X 0 ; Y 0 ) are points represented in the 2D local coordinate systems of each plane. <p> Making sure that the constraint equations properly handle points at infinity is important, since a standard coordinatization of the projective plane with respect to four basis points involves computing a homography mapping finite points to infinite points <ref> [Spri64] </ref>. Points at infinity also arise in practice. Points and lines are duals in the projective plane. Intuitively this means geometric constructions that are valid for points are also valid for lines.
