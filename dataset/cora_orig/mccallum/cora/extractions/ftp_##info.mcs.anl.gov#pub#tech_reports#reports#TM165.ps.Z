Abstract: We record MATLAB experiments implementing the sweeping algorithms we proposed recently to solve five-point stencils arising from the discretization of partial differential equations, notably the Ginzburg-Landau equations from the theory of superconductivity. Algorithms tested include two-direction, multistage, and partial sweeping.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [3] </ref> we proposed a method of sweeping for solving five-point stencils. Our work is motivated by our numerical study of the Ginzburg-Landau equations that arise in the theory of superconductivity. Nevertheless, the sweeping method is applicable to many generic five-point stencils derived from dis-cretizing other partial differential equations. <p> In other words, the relationship of neighborhood is continued across a boundary by wrapping around to the opposite boundary. As explained in <ref> [3] </ref>, the periodic Ginzburg-Landau model that Du, Gunzburger, and Peterson described in [2] leads to a different definition for the lower neighbor of a point on the first row (and the upper neighbor of a point on the last row). <p> Problem III. To get a non-Dirichlet test problem, we take the stencil of Problem II and change the first column of L and the last column of R to ones. Problem IV. For a discussion of the derivation of the discrete Ginzburg-Landau operator that has motivated our study, see <ref> [3] </ref>. Other numerical approaches include the recent work of Du, Gunzburger, and Peterson (finite element method) [?] and Garner et al. (optimization techniques) [4]. We choose for our sample test problem the following parameters: 1. The vortex number nv = 2. 2. <p> The second component of the vector potential B = 0. The coefficients for the stencil are found by using the formulas given in <ref> [3] </ref>. For reference, we list below those corresponding to N = 40: 1. C (i; j) = 4 2. L = R. <p> For a recent reference, see [5] by S. Wright. Many banded matrices can be inverted by the method of sweeping | in particular, those for which none of the elements in the band vanishes. A discussion can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. When the banded matrix is large, instability of the sweeping will be a problem, and the technique of multi-stage or partial sweeping can be applied as in the case of solving stencil equations.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, if the width of a subdomain is small relative to its length, the corresponding rectifying matrix to be inverted turns out to be banded. It is well known that banded matrices need substantially less effort to invert than full matrices. For a recent reference, see <ref> [5] </ref> by S. Wright. Many banded matrices can be inverted by the method of sweeping | in particular, those for which none of the elements in the band vanishes. A discussion can be found in [3].
