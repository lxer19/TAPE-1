Abstract: Multiple Access protocols are distributed algorithms that enable a set of geographically dispersed stations to communicate using a single, common, broadcast channel. We concentrate on the class of Conflict Resolution Algorithms. This class exhibits very good performance characteristics for ``bursty'' computer communications traffic, including high capacity, low delay under light traffic conditions, and inherent stability. One algorithm in this class achieves the highest capacity among all known multiple-access protocols for the infinite population Poisson model. Indeed, this capacity is not far from a theoretical upper bound. After surveying the most important and influential Conflict Resolution Algorithms, the emphasis in our presentation is shifted to methods for their analysis and results of their performance evaluation. We also discuss some extensions of the basic protocols and performance results for non-standard environments, such as Local Area Networks, satellite channels, channels with errors, etc., providing a comprehensive bibliography.

Reference-contexts: The standard assumptions call for either binary feedback of the type ``conflictno-conflict'' or ternary feedback of the type ``idlesuccessconflict.'' Two other types of binary feedback, ``successfailure'' and ``somethingnothing,'' are considered in <ref> [Berge84] </ref>. In general, these types of feedback are more difficult to work with and algorithms for these environments attain lower capacities. In [Pater89b] the authors consider binary ``successfailure'' feedback and propose and analyze a limited sensing algorithm that achieves a capacity of 0.322.

Reference-contexts: Combining this estimation procedure with a CRA leads to hybrid protocols, the most efficient of which resolve conflicts about 20 per cent faster on average than comparable algorithms without conflict multiplicity estimation.

The authors develop a nonadaptive algorithm that resolves conflicts among k out of n stations in time Q (k +k log (n/k )) in the worst case (same as for the STA with deterministic addressing), assuming that the conflict multiplicity k is given a priori.

Reference-contexts: Gated Access Algorithms Capetanakis was probably the first to attempt the delay analysis for a CRA. His results [Capet78, Capet79, Capet79b] consist of bounds on the mean delay for the STA with gated access. Comparable results can be found in <ref> [Masse81] </ref>. 1 Unfortunately, these bounds are not very tight (they diverge as throughput ap proaches capacity), and large numbers of ``magic'' constants appear in the derivation. <p> Tree Algorithms in the Local Area Network (LAN) environment have been suggested from early on by Massey <ref> [Masse81] </ref> and Towsley and Venkatesh [Towsl82]. Notice also, that Hayes' original paper on the subject [Hayes78] was entitled ``An Adaptive Technique for Local Distribution,'' and his model for ``Probing'' is very close to this setting (even though not a direct transmission system). <p> Several strategies have also been proposed for reducing the delay penalty, including breadth-first traversal of the large conflict resolution trees that result from gated access <ref> [Masse81] </ref>, sharing a common ``gate'' among R independent copies of a gated access CRA to reduce the mean variability of the initial conflict multiplicity [Tsyba81], and even sharing a common stack among R copies of a window access CRA to combine the traversals of several trees of low initial conflict multiplicity <p> Channel Errors and Capture Many authors have investigated CRA performance with various channel and feedback error models. The first treatment of channel errors is due, again, to Massey <ref> [Masse81] </ref> who has considered shared channel errors, i.e., errors in the forward channel or the feedback channel, but which all stations perceive in the same way. His model assumes that idle or successful slots can be erroneously recognized as conflicts, while conflict slots are always correctly detected.

Reference-contexts: Tsybakov and Beloyarov [Tsyba90] have developed another algorithm for the same environment with capacity 1/e ~ ~ 0.367; they obtain delay upper bounds for protocols using ``successfailure'' and ``nothingsomething'' feedback in [Tsyba90b]. Massey and Mathys <ref> [Masse85] </ref> consider the standard ALOHA-type channel but with no feedback. It is shown that the capacity under these conditions is 1/e ~ ~ 0.367, i.e., equal to the capacity of the (stabilized) Slotted ALOHA protocol. Tsybakov and Likhanov [Tsyba83] investigate a similar problem.

Reference-contexts: Energy level detectors were suggested in [Georg82] as a way to implement this type of feedback in conjunction with some (additive) channels. The idea of energy level detectors was applied to the ``nothing something'' feedback model by Mehravari <ref> [Mehra88] </ref>, who developed an interval mixing CRA for the case of ``nothingsomethingsomething-else'' feedback.

Reference-contexts: Polyzos et al. [Polyz87] provide delay distribution results for various finite non-homogeneous population models.

Reference-contexts: They also allowed an arbitrary conflict resolution algorithm to be used, although they had to assume that it satisfies the following ``separability'' condition <ref> [Polyz93] </ref> which states that the CRI does not terminate until all packets with arrival times in the window have been successfully transmitted. Thus, the ``tree pruning'' optimization in the 0.487 algorithm which can lead to a regression on the window boundary cannot be directly accommodated. <p> However, they were unable to obtain the kernel of the integral equation exactly and had therefore resorted to bounds in this case. 1 hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 1 This difficulty could be avoided by defining the kernel of the integral equation in terms of the augmented CRI length for the 0.487 Algorithm <ref> [Polyz93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Woodruff's method easily extends to D = 3 as long as the CRI lengths are always odd (as they are for the binary STA). Other combinations can be solved using a regenerative approach <ref> [Tsyba85] </ref>. Woodruff observed that the only non-zero components of the delay are t 0 (which is uniformly distributed over a constant-sized window) and t 2 . Furthermore, they are independent, so we can obtain distributional results by combining the marginal distributions of each component.

Reference-contexts: His model assumes that idle or successful slots can be erroneously recognized as conflicts, while conflict slots are always correctly detected. As we have seen, Paterakis and Papantoni-Kazakos have proposed and analyzed the 2CA, a better alternative than the STA in noisy environments [Pater89]. Vvedenskaya and Tsybakov <ref> [Vvede88] </ref> compute and compare packet delays for two stack algorithms for the case of a channel with feedback errors.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the FEs given in section 5.4 would require significant modifications. Furthermore, their solution would be of greater numerical complexity because of the added dimension. On the other hand, the analysis of LCFS preemptive window algorithms is relatively straightforward. Below we summarize Woodruff's decomposition approach <ref> [Woodr92] </ref> to the case D=2 in combination with any conflict resolution algorithm. Woodruff's method easily extends to D = 3 as long as the CRI lengths are always odd (as they are for the binary STA). Other combinations can be solved using a regenerative approach [Tsyba85].
