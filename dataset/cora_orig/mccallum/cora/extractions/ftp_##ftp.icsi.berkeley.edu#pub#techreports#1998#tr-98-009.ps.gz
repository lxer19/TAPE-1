Abstract: Several interesting strategies are adopted by the well-known Pappas clustering algorithm to segment smooth images. These include exploitation of contextual information to model both class conditional densities and a priori knowledge in a Bayesian framework. Deficiencies of this algorithm are that: i) it removes from the scene any genuine but small region; and ii) its feature-preserving capability largely depends on a user-defined smoothing parameter. This parameter is equivalent to a clique potential of a Markov Random Field model employed to capture known stochastic components of the labeled scene. In this paper a modified version of the Pappas segmentation algorithm is proposed to process smooth and noiseless images requiring enhanced pattern-preserving capability. In the proposed algorithm: iii) no spatial continuity in pixel labeling is enforced to capture known stochastic components of the labeled scene; iv) local intensity parameters, pixel labels, and global intensity parameters are estimated in sequence; and v) if no local intensity average is available to model one category in the neighborhood of a given pixel, then global statistics are employed to determine whether that category is the one closest to pixel data. Results show that our contextual algorithm can be employed: vi) in cascade to any noncontextual (pixel-wise) hard c-means clustering algorithm to enhance detection of small image features; and vii) as the initialization stage of any crisp and iterative segmentation algorithm requiring priors to be neglected on earlier iterations (such as the Iterative Conditional Modes algorithm).

Reference-contexts: For example, the segmentation of a crossboard picture may improve when the number of small holes decreases even though its mislabeling rate actually increases [22]. Therefore, these global statistics cannot be employed for quantitative evaluation of picture segmentation <ref> [29] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: MPAC is a suboptimal iterative algorithm detecting local minima. This is tantamount to stating that MPAC largely depends on its initialization. To initialize MPAC, any hard c-means clustering algorithm can be chosen from those found in the literature, see for example <ref> [30] </ref>, [31]. One main issue regards the number of clusters to be detected [19], [23]. <p> To segment an image featuring no texture and noise, MPAC must be used in cascade with a noncontextual hard c-means clustering algorithm (e.g., see <ref> [30] </ref>, [31]), that provides histogram analysis of pixel values. By alternating between estimating pixel labels and local and global intensity values, MPAC preserves small details better than noncontextual hard c-means clustering algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The second segmentation scheme employed for comparison is the SA algorithm, which is a general purpose approach for detecting the absolute minimum of a cost function <ref> [32] </ref>. <p> Fig. 4 shows the output of the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm exploiting parameters T = 800, ffi = 0:95, fi = 0:5, t max = 150, where t max is the epoch at which the algorithm is stopped <ref> [32] </ref>. Since weight fi of the term enforcing spatial continuity in pixel labeling is small, then, as expected, minimization of Equation (16) provides a segmentation result almost identical to that generated by the hard c-means clustering algorithm at the initialization step.

Reference-contexts: Regions belonging to six classes (tissues) of interest are manually selected by expert photointerpreters. These classes are (see Fig. 30): white matter (red), grey matter (green), Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF, liquor: light blue), lesions (yellow), background (blue), other (bones, fat, thalamus: white). A Self-Organizing Map (SOM, <ref> [33] </ref>) is employed to extract twenty-two statistical regularities (equivalent to centers of image categories or clusters) from the MRI 3-D histogram. Then each cluster is related to one supervised class by majority voting.
