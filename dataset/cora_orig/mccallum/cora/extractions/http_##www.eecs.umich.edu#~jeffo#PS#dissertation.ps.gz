Reference-contexts: Examples of close to quadratic forms are where the kernel of time-frequency distribution is allowed to be signal adaptive [5, 6, 44, 76]. Another approach that is close to quadratic is the reassignment method of Auger and Flandrin <ref> [1] </ref>. The close to quadratic time-frequency distributions often provide improved performance over the quadratic time-frequency distributions. Other time-frequency distributions are explicitly higher order functions of the signal. <p> If the sole purpose of computing a TFD is to obtain a picture, then the extra computations necessary for computing a type I TFD do not present a significant disadvantage. However, for more complicated tasks such as kernels that vary in time and/or frequency [44] or time-frequency reassignment <ref> [1] </ref>, the extra complexity and computations make the type I Cohen's class less desirable and the type II Cohen's class more appealing. 8 We have also investigated the implementation of the type I Cohen's class in the time-lag plane.

Reference-contexts: One example is the hyperbolic class of time-frequency distributions [62]. Time-frequency distributions in the hyperbolic class are covariant to scales and hyperbolic time shifts. The hyperbolic class intersects with the affine class but not with Cohen's class. Baraniuk <ref> [2] </ref> has recently presented a fundamental result concerning the existence of quadratic time-frequency distributions covariant to arbitrary operators. One troublesome aspect of quadratic distributions is that they always contain "cross terms". The cross terms are undesirable for two reasons. <p> Baraniuk has recently developed a fundamental result on the existence of covariant distributions of arbitrary operators. For more information see <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.12 Higher Order Time-Frequency Distributions In this section we will briefly describe three higher order methods for computing time-frequency distributions. The first method we will look at is the Wigner higher order moment spectra by Fonollosa and Nikias [31]. <p> If we focus on a frequency range of [; ], then 36 a cross term should appear at a frequency of ( 2 + 2 )=2 = 0 radians. If we focus on a frequency range of <ref> [0; 2] </ref>, then a cross term should appear at a frequency of ( 2 + 3 radians. There is no reason to prefer one range over another, so a natural solution would be to include cross terms at both 0 and radians. <p> First, since the frequency variable is periodic, the finite frequency support property is not well defined. If one tries to define the finite frequency support property by choosing an arbitrary frequency range, such as <ref> [0; 2] </ref>, then the property can not be satisfied by any type II smoothed Wigner distribution because of the circular cross terms. However, the strong frequency support property [46] can be satisfied.

The most common distributions outside of time and frequency are those of time and scale. The concept of scale is closely related to the concept of frequency and some time-frequency distributions, like the those in the affine class, have analogous time-scale distributions.

Also, the Wigner distribution for a specific signal can be quite different in different locations of the time 21 (a) Wigner Distribution (b) Spectrogram (c) Choi-Williams Distribution butions in Cohen's class. 22 frequency plane. <p> Since the structure of the cross terms and auto terms in the Wigner distribution varies greatly for different signals, kernels that work well for one signal will not necessarily 105 work well for other signals. Because of this, Baraniuk and Jones <ref> [5, 6] </ref> have proposed methods for creating signal adaptive kernels. Their algorithms use the ambiguity function as a means for finding "good" signal-adaptive kernels. <p> It has been observed that, in the ambiguity function, the auto terms lie near the origin while the cross terms tend to lie away from the origin [27] and the methods of Baraniuk and Jones exploit this observation. The signal dependent kernel introduced in <ref> [5] </ref> is called a radially Gaussian kernel (RGK) and is formulated in the ambiguity plane as: (; t ) = exp 2 + t 2 where the spread function, (-), controls the "spread" of the kernel at angle -.

Reference-contexts: It is our conjecture that there does not exist a corresponding form for the Wigner distribution in the class of AF-GDTFDs. 3.9 The AF-GDTFDs Versus the GDTFDs A very commonly used method for computing TFDs of sampled signals is Boashash's <ref> [9] </ref> Generalized Discrete Time-Frequency Distributions (GDTFDs). In this section, we will present a detailed comparison of the AF-GDTFDs and the GDTFDs. <p> The first approach uses the IF of the underlying continuous signal, the second and third approaches are variants of the methods by Claasen and Mecklenbrauker [17] and Boashash <ref> [9] </ref>. None of the three approaches are completely satisfactory, and perhaps a different definition for the moments of a periodic function could provide a more complete answer. First Approach The first approach tries to mimic the requirements for the type I Cohen's class. <p> However, we will use the following definition for the periodic frequency moment: h! 3 i n = 1 Z 2 e j2! C II This definition is similar to the one first proposed by Claasen and Mecklenbrauker for their discrete Wigner distribution [17] and later used by Boashash <ref> [9] </ref>. If we constrain the kernel such that (n; 2) = cffi (n), for some constant c, then the following is true: h! 3 i = '(n + 1) '(n 1) 66 A proof of this is given in the appendix. This approach is unappealing for two reasons. <p> The first assumes that the samples before and after the actual samples are zero, and the second assumes that we have one period a periodic signal. Perhaps the most commonly used method for computing TFDs of sampled signals is Boashash's generalized discrete time-frequency distributions <ref> [9] </ref> (GDTFDs). In the previous chapter we compared the GDTFDs with the type II Cohen's class (then the AF-GDTFDs) and concluded that the type II Cohen's class should be used in place of the GDTFDs.

Reference-contexts: For more details see <ref> [10] </ref> 8 One advantage of the analytic signal is that it can be sampled at half the rate of the real signal. Another advantage of the analytic signal, which will be discussed later, is that there are fewer cross terms in the time-frequency distribution of an analytic signal.

Reference-contexts: The first, as defined by Nuttall [52, 53] computes samples of TFDs in Cohen's class 28 from the sampled signal. Two similar methods for computing TFDs from sampled signals are the generalized discrete time-frequency distributions (GDTFDs) of Boashash <ref> [11] </ref> and the alias-free generalized discrete time-frequency distributions (AF-GDTFDs) of Jeong and Williams [42]. The GDTFDs use a signal that is sampled at twice the Nyquist rate to compute a class of TFDs, while the AF-GDTFDs use a Nyquist sampled signal to compute a class of TFDs.

Reference-contexts: The close to quadratic time-frequency distributions often provide improved performance over the quadratic time-frequency distributions. Other time-frequency distributions are explicitly higher order functions of the signal. Some examples are the polynomial Wigner distributions by Boashash and O'Shea <ref> [12] </ref>, the L-Wigner distributions by Stankovic [70, 69, 71], and the Wigner higher order moment spectra by Fonollosa and Nikias [31]. These higher order methods provide remarkable results for very specific classes of signals, but produce extremely unsatisfactory results for most signals. <p> Boashash and O'Shea <ref> [12] </ref> have developed a class of time-frequency distributions called polynomial Wigner distributions (PWDs). The PWDs provide the optimum concentration in the time-frequency plane for signals with a polynomial frequency modulation, while the Wigner distribution only provides the optimal concentration for a signal with a linear frequency modulation. <p> Stankovic and Stankovic [69, 70, 71] have defined a class of L-Wigner distributions that are functions one time variable and one frequency variable. Boashash and O'Shea <ref> [12] </ref> have defined a class of polynomial Wigner distributions that are also functions 102 of one time variable and one frequency variable. Fonollosa and Nikias defined a class of Wigner higher order moment spectra that are based on higher order moments of the signal. <p> Stankovic and Stankovic [69, 70, 71] defined the class of L-Wigner distributions as: L x (t; !; `) = [x (t + t 2` )] ` e j!t dt Boashash and O'Shea <ref> [12] </ref> defined a class of polynomial Wigner distributions as: P x (t; !) = k=q=2 As shown in a previous section, one can compute the second order L-Wigner distribution from the Q function, but there does not appear to be any other relationships between the Q function, the L-Wigner distributions, and <p> This is similar in spirit to the spectrogram decompositions of TFDs [26, 75], but has the potential to provide far greater performance. 5.9 Conclusions This chapter provides a means for representing a signal in several new domains by using quartic functions of the signal. Previous higher order methods <ref> [12, 31, 69, 70, 71] </ref> have focused on representing the signal in terms of one or more time and frequency variables. This chapter derives the Q function which represents the signal simultaneously in time, frequency, lag, and doppler.

Reference-contexts: The AF-GDTFDs of Jeong and Williams have properties that are clearly different from TFDs in Cohen's class, and the properties of the AF-GDTFDs are also not well understood. Authors have claimed <ref> [13, 77] </ref> that the differences between TFDs in the class of AF-GDTFDs and TFDs in Cohen's class are due to aliasing. The methods for computing Fourier transforms of continuous and sampled signals are similar, but not identical [61].

Reference-contexts: A simple, but useful, observation is that by using a kernel that acts as a low pass filter, one can attenuate cross terms and retain the auto terms. This was first observed by Choi and Williams <ref> [15] </ref> when they created a Gaussian kernel of the form: (; t ) = e 2 t 2 = where the parameter controls the cut off frequency of the filter.

Let us assume that the continuous signal, of which we would like to compute the Wigner distribution, is approximately zero outside [0; N T ) where T is the sampling period corresponding to the Nyquist rate.

For more complete reviews see <ref> [21, 22, 35] </ref>. 2.1 The Need for Time-Frequency Distributions The distribution of signal energy in the time and the distribution of signal energy in frequency are very straightforward. <p> These four functions will be used extensively throughout the dissertation. 2.8 Cohen's Class of Time-Frequency Distributions Following the example of the Wigner distribution, authors have developed alternative methods for obtaining time-frequency distributions. We will mention some of them briefly here, for a more detailed history see <ref> [21] </ref>. The Rihaczek distribution is defined as: RD x (t; !) = x fl (t) X (!) e j!t The Rihaczek distribution is simpler to compute than the Wigner distribution and also satisfies the marginal properties as defined above, but will be complex valued. <p> In his pioneering work, Cohen [20] devised a method for creating an infinite number of 17 time-frequency distributions. The method he used to do this is based in quantum mechanics and is derived using operator theory. For more details on the derivation see <ref> [22, 21] </ref>. <p> Remember that kernels for the AF-GDTFDs are sampled on hexagonal grids due to the full outer product sampling. The kernels corresponding to the discrete spectrogram, Born-Jordan, Rihaczek, Page, and Levin distributions are all direct discretizations of the corresponding kernels for Cohen's class TFDs <ref> [21, 22] </ref>. These discrete TFDs are all computed from the Nyquist sampled signal, are covariant to time shifts and circular frequency shifts, and satisfy many of the properties of the corresponding Cohen's class TFDs (e.g. marginals). <p> The four signal types are listed in Table 4.1 along with their properties in the time domain. For each of the four types of signals, there is an appropriate Fourier transform pair, so it seems plausible that there should exist four types of time-frequency distributions. Cohen's class <ref> [21, 22] </ref> (with the restriction that the kernel not be a function of time and frequency and also not a function of the signal) can derived axiomatically as the class of all quadratic time-frequency distributions for type I signals that are covariant to time shifts and frequency shifts. <p> Since the AF-GDTFDs are covariant to time and frequency shifts, they are clearly a subset of the type II Cohen's class, however, nothing more can be said at this point. There are three common methods for deriving time-frequency distributions for type I signals. The first uses operator theory <ref> [21, 22] </ref>, the second uses group theory [68], and the third uses covariance properties [29].

The theory has been progressing rapidly and has been successfully applied to wide variety of signals including the following: speech, biological, biomedical, geophysical, machine monitoring, radar, and electro-magnetic scatter. <p> Loughlin et. al. [47] and also Sang et. al. [67] have created positive time-frequency distributions by iterating quadratic time-frequency distributions. There has also been recent work in constructing distributions of quantities other than time and frequency <ref> [3, 4, 39, 22] </ref>. The most common distributions outside of time and frequency are those of time and scale. The concept of scale is closely related to the concept of frequency and some time-frequency distributions, like the those in the affine class, have analogous time-scale distributions. <p> Finally, chapter six provides directions for future work. 5 CHAPTER 2 REVIEW OF TIME-FREQUENCY ANALYSIS This chapter presents a background of the concepts used in time-frequency analysis that are necessary for understanding the rest of the dissertation. For more complete reviews see <ref> [21, 22, 35] </ref>. 2.1 The Need for Time-Frequency Distributions The distribution of signal energy in the time and the distribution of signal energy in frequency are very straightforward. <p> In his pioneering work, Cohen [20] devised a method for creating an infinite number of 17 time-frequency distributions. The method he used to do this is based in quantum mechanics and is derived using operator theory. For more details on the derivation see <ref> [22, 21] </ref>. <p> Remember that kernels for the AF-GDTFDs are sampled on hexagonal grids due to the full outer product sampling. The kernels corresponding to the discrete spectrogram, Born-Jordan, Rihaczek, Page, and Levin distributions are all direct discretizations of the corresponding kernels for Cohen's class TFDs <ref> [21, 22] </ref>. These discrete TFDs are all computed from the Nyquist sampled signal, are covariant to time shifts and circular frequency shifts, and satisfy many of the properties of the corresponding Cohen's class TFDs (e.g. marginals). <p> The four signal types are listed in Table 4.1 along with their properties in the time domain. For each of the four types of signals, there is an appropriate Fourier transform pair, so it seems plausible that there should exist four types of time-frequency distributions. Cohen's class <ref> [21, 22] </ref> (with the restriction that the kernel not be a function of time and frequency and also not a function of the signal) can derived axiomatically as the class of all quadratic time-frequency distributions for type I signals that are covariant to time shifts and frequency shifts. <p> Since the AF-GDTFDs are covariant to time and frequency shifts, they are clearly a subset of the type II Cohen's class, however, nothing more can be said at this point. There are three common methods for deriving time-frequency distributions for type I signals. The first uses operator theory <ref> [21, 22] </ref>, the second uses group theory [68], and the third uses covariance properties [29].

Reference-contexts: These higher order distributions seem to have promise but are currently not well understood. It is often desired that a time-frequency distribution be positive valued, and Cohen has created a general class of time-frequency that are always positive valued <ref> [23] </ref>. Since this class is very general, it intersects with every class (quadratic and non-quadratic) of time-frequency distributions listed above. The main difficulty with this class is that it is not clear how to construct time-frequency distributions in the class.

Reference-contexts: Their TACF is sampled in the lag direction at half the Nyquist rate, so aliasing occurs and the frequency axis has a period of rather than 2. To avoid aliasing the signal must be sampled at twice the Nyquist rate. Costa and Boudreaux-Bartels <ref> [24] </ref> and also Morris and Wu [50] have claimed a third type of aliasing. They point out that in the AF-GDTFDs, there are extra components that are not present in TFDs in Cohen's class. <p> A nice example of this is the binomial distributions of low and high frequency sinusoids in Figure 3.5. In both cases, the cross term that is attenuated the least is the one that is closest to the auto terms. 3.7.4 Cross Terms or Aliasing? Costa and Boudreaux-Bartels <ref> [24] </ref> and also Morris and Wu [50] have claimed that the extra components that appear in the AF-GDTFDs are due to aliasing, since these components do not appear in Cohen's class and are separated in frequency by radians away from other components.

Reference-contexts: Their algorithms use the ambiguity function as a means for finding "good" signal-adaptive kernels.

Reference-contexts: Other time-frequency distributions are explicitly higher order functions of the signal. Some examples are the polynomial Wigner distributions by Boashash and O'Shea [12], the L-Wigner distributions by Stankovic [70, 69, 71], and the Wigner higher order moment spectra by Fonollosa and Nikias <ref> [31] </ref>. These higher order methods provide remarkable results for very specific classes of signals, but produce extremely unsatisfactory results for most signals. These higher order distributions seem to have promise but are currently not well understood. <p> For more information see [2]. 2.12 Higher Order Time-Frequency Distributions In this section we will briefly describe three higher order methods for computing time-frequency distributions. The first method we will look at is the Wigner higher order moment spectra by Fonollosa and Nikias <ref> [31] </ref>. Fonollosa and Nikias have generalized the Wigner distribution to a Wigner bispectrum, Wigner trispectrum, and so forth. <p> This provides further support for calling the third and fourth terms auto terms. 5.6 Relationships with other Quartic Distributions In this section we will compare the Q function with other quartic functions defined in the context of time-frequency analysis. Fonollosa and Nikias <ref> [31] </ref> have defined a class of Wigner higher order moment spectra that are functions of one time variable and multiple frequency variables. Stankovic and Stankovic [69, 70, 71] have defined a class of L-Wigner distributions that are functions one time variable and one frequency variable. <p> This is similar in spirit to the spectrogram decompositions of TFDs [26, 75], but has the potential to provide far greater performance. 5.9 Conclusions This chapter provides a means for representing a signal in several new domains by using quartic functions of the signal. Previous higher order methods <ref> [12, 31, 69, 70, 71] </ref> have focused on representing the signal in terms of one or more time and frequency variables. This chapter derives the Q function which represents the signal simultaneously in time, frequency, lag, and doppler.

For more complete reviews see <ref> [21, 22, 35] </ref>. 2.1 The Need for Time-Frequency Distributions The distribution of signal energy in the time and the distribution of signal energy in frequency are very straightforward. <p> Also, the time marginal of a time-frequency distribution is the integral of the time-frequency distribution over frequency, and the time marginal should be identical to the distribution of signal energy over time. These properties and several others are listed in Table 2.1. For a more complete listing see <ref> [35] </ref>. 2.5 Covariance and Invariance The notion of a density function being covariant or invariant to an operator plays an important role in time-frequency analysis. <p> By using the analytic signal, one removes the redundant information and also many of the cross terms that hinder the interpretation of the Wigner distribution. The ambiguity function has been used extensively for applications of radar, and is also important in time-frequency analysis <ref> [35] </ref>. <p> The cross term properties of the Wigner distribution and the Rihaczek distribution are quite different [37] even though they 35 are both members of Cohen's class.

Reference-contexts: Two similar methods for computing TFDs from sampled signals are the generalized discrete time-frequency distributions (GDTFDs) of Boashash [11] and the alias-free generalized discrete time-frequency distributions (AF-GDTFDs) of Jeong and Williams <ref> [42] </ref>. The GDTFDs use a signal that is sampled at twice the Nyquist rate to compute a class of TFDs, while the AF-GDTFDs use a Nyquist sampled signal to compute a class of TFDs. <p> From this sampled signal, there are two common ways to sample the temporal auto-correlation function <ref> [42] </ref>. The first method, called "half outer product" sampling and denoted R h x (n; m), is defined for n 2 ZZ and even m. This method uses only half of the available samples and results in a TACF that is sampled on a rectangular grid. <p> continuous and periodic in frequency, * satisfy circular cross term rules, * include the discrete time spectrogram, * use the Nyquist sampled signal, and * be covariant to time shifts and circular frequency shifts. 3.6 Analysis of the AF-GDTFDs TFDs in the class of alias-free generalized discrete time-frequency distributions (AF-GDTFDs) <ref> [42] </ref> can be constrained to satisfy many desirable properties TFDs. However, there is currently no relationship between the AF-GDTFDs and any continuous TFD, so the AF-GDTFDs are not well understood. <p> An unusual feature of R II x (n; m) and (n; m) is that they are only defined when n m 2 ; m 2 ZZ, resulting in a hexagonal sampling grid. 3 The class of AF-GDTFDs were originally presented by Jeong and Williams <ref> [42] </ref> in the form of equation 4.4b however this notation is somewhat cumbersome due to the hexagonal sampling. The forms in equations 4.4a and 4.4c arrive naturally from the derivation and provide a more elegant notation. <p> When the class of AF-GDTFDs was originally presented by Jeong and Williams <ref> [42] </ref>, they also derived kernel constraints for the distributions to satisfy many desirable properties: realness, positivity, time shift covariance, frequency shift covariance, time marginals, frequency marginals, finite time support, finite frequency support, instantaneous frequency, and group delay. <p> The result given below also holds for the more general case, however, we do not wish to introduce type II cross TFDs at this point. 63 4.4.2 Group Delay In <ref> [42] </ref> a kernel constraint was given for the AF-GDTFDs to satisfy the group delay property. However this constraint was presented as a discretization of the constraint for the type I Cohen's class, and does not hold in general for the type II Cohen's class. <p> Under certain kernel constraints, the type I Cohen's class satisfies the following IF property: R x (t; !; ) d! C I = @t 64 Jeong et. al. <ref> [42, 40] </ref> use the following definition for the first frequency moment for a type II TFD: R x (n; !; ) d!

Reference-contexts: Some methods, that are very similar to the Cohen's and affine classes, but not quadratic will be called "close" to the quadratic. Examples of close to quadratic forms are where the kernel of time-frequency distribution is allowed to be signal adaptive <ref> [5, 6, 44, 76] </ref>. Another approach that is close to quadratic is the reassignment method of Auger and Flandrin [1]. The close to quadratic time-frequency distributions often provide improved performance over the quadratic time-frequency distributions. Other time-frequency distributions are explicitly higher order functions of the signal. <p> The second part of this dissertation derives and investigates a quartic (quadralinear) function of a signal that is fundamentally different from previous higher order distributions. The quartic function is used to greatly extend the close-to-quadratic time-frequency distributions of Jones and Baraniuk <ref> [44] </ref>. This function also provides insight into the L-Wigner distributions of Stankovic [69, 70, 71]. The organization of the dissertation is as follows. Chapter two provides a review of the concepts in time-frequency analysis that are used throughout the dissertation. <p> Another extension to Cohen's class would be to allow the kernel to vary as a function of time and frequency (similar to a time-varying filter). Jones and Baraniuk have created a method for designing time-varying, signal-adaptive kernels <ref> [44] </ref>. <p> If the sole purpose of computing a TFD is to obtain a picture, then the extra computations necessary for computing a type I TFD do not present a significant disadvantage. However, for more complicated tasks such as kernels that vary in time and/or frequency <ref> [44] </ref> or time-frequency reassignment [1], the extra complexity and computations make the type I Cohen's class less desirable and the type II Cohen's class more appealing. 8 We have also investigated the implementation of the type I Cohen's class in the time-lag plane. <p> In the same way, one can apply kernels to the quartic functions to create an infinite number of distributions of three and four variables. 103 Jones and Baraniuk have developed a method for creating a function of time, lag, and doppler that they call a short-time ambiguity function (STAF) <ref> [44] </ref>. They developed this function for the purpose of creating signal-adaptive kernels that vary over time. <p> But since the signal is non-stationary, it is reasonable to assume that a kernel that works well at one time, will not necessarily work well at another time. Jones and Baraniuk recognized this and extended their RGK algorithm to design signal-adaptive, time-varying kernels <ref> [44] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If one tries to define the finite frequency support property by choosing an arbitrary frequency range, such as [0; 2], then the property can not be satisfied by any type II smoothed Wigner distribution because of the circular cross terms.

Reference-contexts: Since this class is very general, it intersects with every class (quadratic and non-quadratic) of time-frequency distributions listed above. The main difficulty with this class is that it is not clear how to construct time-frequency distributions in the class. Loughlin et. al. <ref> [47] </ref> and also Sang et. al.

Reference-contexts: Second Approach The second approach assumes a sampled signal of the form x (n) = A (n) e j'(n) A (n) &gt; 0 (4.9) and uses the following definition for the periodic frequency moment: h! 2 i n = arg 0 x (n; !; )d! (4.10) Lovell et. al <ref> [48] </ref> has used this periodic moment in defining frequency estimators and shown that, for sampled signals, it provides improved performance over non-periodic moments. This definition for the periodic frequency moment finds the weighted average "angle" for each time. An example of the periodic moment is shown in Figure 4.2.

Reference-contexts: Their TACF is sampled in the lag direction at half the Nyquist rate, so aliasing occurs and the frequency axis has a period of rather than 2. To avoid aliasing the signal must be sampled at twice the Nyquist rate. Costa and Boudreaux-Bartels [24] and also Morris and Wu <ref> [50] </ref> have claimed a third type of aliasing. They point out that in the AF-GDTFDs, there are extra components that are not present in TFDs in Cohen's class. <p> In both cases, the cross term that is attenuated the least is the one that is closest to the auto terms. 3.7.4 Cross Terms or Aliasing? Costa and Boudreaux-Bartels [24] and also Morris and Wu <ref> [50] </ref> have claimed that the extra components that appear in the AF-GDTFDs are due to aliasing, since these components do not appear in Cohen's class and are separated in frequency by radians away from other components. <p> One alternative would be to base the type II Cohen's class on the type II Rihaczek distribution (as will be defined below) and a type II asymmetric ambiguity function, and present kernel constraints in these domains. Morris and Wu <ref> [50] </ref> have rederived kernel constraints for the AF-GDTFDs (now the type II Cohen's class) using an asymmetric definition of the type II ambiguity function.

Reference-contexts: In this chapter we will consider three methods for computing classes of TFDs from sampled signals. The first, as defined by Nuttall <ref> [52, 53] </ref> computes samples of TFDs in Cohen's class 28 from the sampled signal. Two similar methods for computing TFDs from sampled signals are the generalized discrete time-frequency distributions (GDTFDs) of Boashash [11] and the alias-free generalized discrete time-frequency distributions (AF-GDTFDs) of Jeong and Williams [42]. <p> In the frequency domain, the periodic repetitions overlap and the continuous signal can not be recovered. In the time-frequency literature, the word "aliasing" has been used to describe several different phenomena as explained here. Nuttall <ref> [52, 53] </ref> has defined his discrete time-frequency distributions to be samples of the continuous distributions in the time-frequency plane. Here, aliasing occurs if the sampling rates in the time and frequency directions are less than the appropriate Nyquist rates. <p> The simplest way to analyze the aliasing in the sampled TACF is to analyze what happens to the spectral auto-correlation function (SACF). For a continuous, bandlimited signal, the SACF has a diamond shaped region of support <ref> [52, 65] </ref>. When the TACF is sampled, the SACF becomes a periodic function. If the periodic repetitions of the SACF overlap, then aliasing occurs in the TACF. For half outer product sampling, the diamonds in the SACF clearly overlap, so aliasing has occurred. <p> Therefore we can represent the Wigner distribution with a 2N by 2N matrix of samples: W d 2 ; 2k 2 ; = 2k for n; k 2 f0; : : : ; 2N 1g. We can also reconstruct the continuous Wigner distribution from these samples. Nuttall <ref> [52] </ref> has also devised a method for computing samples of the Wigner distribution without explicitly oversampling the signal by two.

This is exactly the approach taken by Nuttall in <ref> [53] </ref>. However, there are several drawbacks to Nuttall's method. Nuttall claims that the two-dimensional Nyquist rate for TFDs in Cohen's class is higher than the two-dimensional Nyquist rate of the Wigner distribution, and that TFDs in Cohen's class require more samples than are required for the Wigner distribution.

Reference-contexts: Authors have claimed [13, 77] that the differences between TFDs in the class of AF-GDTFDs and TFDs in Cohen's class are due to aliasing. The methods for computing Fourier transforms of continuous and sampled signals are similar, but not identical <ref> [61] </ref>. The properties of the Fourier transforms for continuous and sampled signals are also not identical. One example being that the product of two continuous signals is a linear convolution of the spectra while the product of two sampled signals is a circular convolution of the spectra.

Reference-contexts: Recently, quadratic time-frequency distributions have been defined that are covariant to operators other than the three mentioned above. One example is the hyperbolic class of time-frequency distributions <ref> [62] </ref>. Time-frequency distributions in the hyperbolic class are covariant to scales and hyperbolic time shifts. The hyperbolic class intersects with the affine class but not with Cohen's class. Baraniuk [2] has recently presented a fundamental result concerning the existence of quadratic time-frequency distributions covariant to arbitrary operators. <p> The scalogram is 24 defined as the squared magnitude of the wavelet transform, and scalograms are a subset of the affine class. Recently, Papandreou et. al. <ref> [62] </ref> have defined another quadratic class called the hyperbolic class. This class consists of all quadratic time-frequency distributions covariant to scales and "hyperbolic time-shifts".

Reference-contexts: The close to quadratic time-frequency distributions often provide improved performance over the quadratic time-frequency distributions. Other time-frequency distributions are explicitly higher order functions of the signal. Some examples are the polynomial Wigner distributions by Boashash and O'Shea [12], the L-Wigner distributions by Stankovic <ref> [70, 69, 71] </ref>, and the Wigner higher order moment spectra by Fonollosa and Nikias [31].

Stankovic and Stankovic <ref> [69, 70, 71] </ref> have defined a class of L-Wigner distributions that are functions one time variable and one frequency variable. Boashash and O'Shea [12] have defined a class of polynomial Wigner distributions that are also functions 102 of one time variable and one frequency variable. <p> Although the Wigner higher order moment spectra have a similar appearance to the Q function defined in this chapter, there is no clear relation between the two.

Previous higher order methods <ref> [12, 31, 69, 70, 71] </ref> have focused on representing the signal in terms of one or more time and frequency variables. This chapter derives the Q function which represents the signal simultaneously in time, frequency, lag, and doppler. <p> One can foresee this process going on indefinitely with the dimension of the kernel continually increasing. While this is clearly not a practical method, it could provide insight into other methods for creating TFDs. 6.2.2 L-Wigner Distributions Stankovic et. al. <ref> [69, 70, 71] </ref> have defined a class of L-Wigner distributions that has very interesting properties. The class is defined as: L x (t; !; `) = x (t + t 2` )] 2` e j!t dt where ` is the order of the L-Wigner distribution.

Reference-contexts: The close to quadratic time-frequency distributions often provide improved performance over the quadratic time-frequency distributions. Other time-frequency distributions are explicitly higher order functions of the signal. Some examples are the polynomial Wigner distributions by Boashash and O'Shea [12], the L-Wigner distributions by Stankovic <ref> [70, 69, 71] </ref>, and the Wigner higher order moment spectra by Fonollosa and Nikias [31]. These higher order methods provide remarkable results for very specific classes of signals, but produce extremely unsatisfactory results for most signals. These higher order distributions seem to have promise but are currently not well understood. <p> The quartic function is used to greatly extend the close-to-quadratic time-frequency distributions of Jones and Baraniuk [44]. This function also provides insight into the L-Wigner distributions of Stankovic <ref> [69, 70, 71] </ref>. The organization of the dissertation is as follows.

Reference-contexts: The Wigner distribution is more commonly presented in the following form: W x (t; !) = x (t + t 2 ) e j!t dt (2.2) and was derived in the context of quantum mechanics by Wigner [73] and later extended to the signal processing context by Ville <ref> [72] </ref>. The Wigner distribution satisfies many of the desirable properties in Table 2.1 (all except positivity, strong time support, and strong frequency support).

Reference-contexts: Three examples of modified kernels in the time-frequency plane are shown in Figure 3.4. The first kernel, called the binomial kernel, was constructed specifically for the class of AF-GDTFDs and has many interesting properties <ref> [74] </ref>. The second kernel, called a quasi-Wigner kernel, is, in a sense, "close" to the kernel of the Wigner distribution. This kernel is useful for illustrating the properties of the AF-GDTFDs. The third kernel corresponds to a discrete spectrogram with a Hanning window. Each kernel contains two distinct parts. <p> For example, the continuous and 50 discrete Rihaczek distributions are defined as: RD I RD II The binomial kernel was first presented by Williams and Jeong in <ref> [74] </ref>. The binomial kernel satisfies many of the desirable properties of TFDs and the recursive structure also allows the implementation of fast algorithms. The quasi-Wigner kernel provides very little smoothing so is, in a sense, "close" to a Wigner kernel.

Reference-contexts: The inclusion of the spectrogram in the class of AF-GDTFDs allows for practical results such as methods for obtaining positive distributions that satisfy the marginals [47] and the formulation of fast algorithms <ref> [25, 75] </ref>. The AF-GDTFDs also provide better results when synthesizing a signal from a TFD [41]. <p> The optimization routine would, for each point in the time-frequency plane, find the "optimum" linear combination of the dictionary TFDs. This is similar in spirit to the spectrogram decompositions of TFDs <ref> [26, 75] </ref>, but has the potential to provide far greater performance. 5.9 Conclusions This chapter provides a means for representing a signal in several new domains by using quartic functions of the signal.

Reference-contexts: Some methods, that are very similar to the Cohen's and affine classes, but not quadratic will be called "close" to the quadratic. Examples of close to quadratic forms are where the kernel of time-frequency distribution is allowed to be signal adaptive <ref> [5, 6, 44, 76] </ref>. Another approach that is close to quadratic is the reassignment method of Auger and Flandrin [1]. The close to quadratic time-frequency distributions often provide improved performance over the quadratic time-frequency distributions. Other time-frequency distributions are explicitly higher order functions of the signal.

Reference-contexts: The AF-GDTFDs of Jeong and Williams have properties that are clearly different from TFDs in Cohen's class, and the properties of the AF-GDTFDs are also not well understood. Authors have claimed <ref> [13, 77] </ref> that the differences between TFDs in the class of AF-GDTFDs and TFDs in Cohen's class are due to aliasing. The methods for computing Fourier transforms of continuous and sampled signals are similar, but not identical [61].
