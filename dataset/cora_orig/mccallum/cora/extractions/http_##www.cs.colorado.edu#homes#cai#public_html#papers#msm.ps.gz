Abstract: The class of multiplicative Schwarz methods originated from the classical Schwarz alternating method. It has been shown to be one of the most powerful methods for solving finite element or finite difference elliptic problems. In this paper, we extend these methods to a class of singularly perturbed equations, that are encountered when discretizing parabolic equations by implicit methods such as the backward Euler's or Crank-Nicolson's schemes. We discuss several algorithms, including one-level, two-level and multilevel overlapping methods and study how the convergence rates depend on the time and space discretization parameters, as well as subspace decomposition parameters such as the number of subregions and the number of levels to which the finite element space is decomposed. We show that in the presence of a fine enough coarse mesh space the algorithms are optimal for both symmetric and nonsymmetric problems, i.e. the convergence rates are independent of all these parameters in both two and three dimensions. If the coarse mesh space is dropped, the algorithms are still optimal but only if the time step and the coarse mesh size satisfy certain relationship.

In the multilevel case, the uniformity is also with respect to the number of levels. 2.1. One- and Two-level Decompositions. Both decompositions have been discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>, and the boundedness of the one-level decomposition is discussed only for the case d = 2. Here, we cover both d = 2 and 3. <p> It was proved in <ref> [4] </ref> that the two-level decomposition (5) is uniformly bounded in the k k a t norm in both two- and three-dimensional spaces. Lemma 2.1. <p> If we drop the coarse mesh space V 0 from (5) and v 0 from the decomposition, the following estimate holds for both d = 2 and 3. The case d = 2 was concerned in <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, as shown above, in the parabolic case, only a factor of t =H 2 appears in the estimate and t is usually in the order of the time step size. 2.2. Multilevel Decompositions. Following Dryja and Widlund [14] and Zhang <ref> [27] </ref>, we let fT l g L l=0 be a nested sequence of triangulations of , i.e. <p> constant C &gt; 0, independent of the parameters h, H and L, such that kv 0 k 2 L X J l X kv l a Ckvk 2 a ; 8v 2 V h : We refer to Bramble and Pasciak [1], Dryja and Widlund [14], Oswald [22] and Zhang <ref> [27] </ref> for the analysis and discussions of this bound. In order to prove that the decomposition (11) is also uniformly bounded in the t dependent norm kk a t , we need only to show that the same decomposition is uniformly bounded in the L 2 () norm. <p> We use the fact that L X kv l k 2 a Ckvk 2 a ; 8v 2 V h ;(19) where the constant C &gt; 0 is independent of the parameters h, H and L. We refer to Bramble and Pasciak [1], Oswald [22] and Zhang <ref> [27] </ref> for the proofs and discussions. <p> In general, jEj l 1 J or J + 1 for one- or two-level methods.
