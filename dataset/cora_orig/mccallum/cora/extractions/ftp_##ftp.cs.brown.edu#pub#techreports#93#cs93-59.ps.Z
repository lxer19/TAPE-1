Reference-contexts: Two microkernels that have achieved some degree of success are Chorus [7], from Chorus Systems, and Mach [4], from Carnegie Mellon University. Both have been used as the basis of UNIX implementations: Chorus with UNIX System V Release 4 <ref> [1] </ref> and Mach with Berkeley UNIX and OSF/1 [5]. There have been a few experiments in building personalities for other operating systems on top of Mach [6, 9]. IBM has demonstrated an OS/2 personality for Mach.

Reference-contexts: The big-endian vs. little-indian distinction, an allusion to Swifts Gullivers Travels, refers to whether the byte addressed by the address of an integer contains the most significant bits (big-endian) or the least significant bits (little-endian). This allusion was first made by D. Cohen in <ref> [2] </ref>. 5.1.4 Identification We ordinarily think of a remote procedure as being a service or part of a service that is being made available to potential clients.

Reference-contexts: There have been a few experiments in building personalities for other operating systems on top of Mach [6, 9]. IBM has demonstrated an OS/2 personality for Mach. Furthermore, the architecture of NT is based on microkernel concepts <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.1 Why Use Microkernels? Why is there interest in microkernels? We argue below that execution speed is not the rea-sona microkernel-based implementation of an operating system may well be inherently slower than a traditional monolithic implementation.

Reference-contexts: The user applications are clients of the personalitythey obtain operating-system services from the personality (though the services of the microkernel might be used to provide communication between the applications and the personality). Two microkernels that have achieved some degree of success are Chorus [7], from Chorus Systems, and Mach <ref> [4] </ref>, from Carnegie Mellon University.

Reference-contexts: An authorization service that manages the use of ACLs (access control lists), allowing servers to determine if clients should be allowed to perform the operations they have requested. The authentication service is based upon MITs Kerberos system <ref> [8] </ref>. This is a private key approach in which one or more trusted servers store a copy of each principals private encryption key. (A principal is some entity, such as a user or a server, than can enter in security negotiations.
