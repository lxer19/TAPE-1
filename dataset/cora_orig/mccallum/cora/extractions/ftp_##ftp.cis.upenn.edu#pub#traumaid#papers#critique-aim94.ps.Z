Reference-contexts: While recognizing these systems' potential for improving the quality of patient care and for controlling costs, physicians have tended to reject new technologies which they see as intrusive, time-consuming, or a challenge to their judgment or autonomy as clinical decision-makers <ref> [1] </ref>. At the same time, the information processing demands on physicians have been increasing dramatically. Utilizing available clinical data to make appropriate decisions about patient care can be challenging to physicians, who are susceptible to information overload which can lead to biases in data acquisition and processing [8].

Reference-contexts: To counteract the limitations of human information processing, computer-based decision-support systems have been developed to monitor clinical data as they become available and make physicians aware of pertinent events by means of reminders [4] or alerts <ref> [2] </ref>. Other systems follow the critiquing approach, providing a more extensive off-line discussion of the risks and benefits of alternative management plans [5, 9].

Reference-contexts: To address these concerns, we began work on a critiquing interface, Trauma-TIQ, which would take a proposed plan from the physician and produce a critique of that plan, focusing on those items where there was a potential disagreement <ref> [3] </ref>. In this way, important points could be emphasized, and the physicians would not have to be presented with a great deal of information that simply confirmed what they were planning to do already in order to find what was different.

Reference-contexts: Our collaborators in this area have developed an approach to speech generation that takes account of both the informational content and the discourse context of the proposition to be expressed in order to produce appropriate stress and intonational contours <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. This technique can drastically increase the hearer's ability to grasp the meaning of an utterance, particularly in a situation where a contrast is being made.
