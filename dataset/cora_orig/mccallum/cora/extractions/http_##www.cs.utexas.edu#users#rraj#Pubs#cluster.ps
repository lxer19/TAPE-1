Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of circuit clustering for delay minimization, subject to area capacity constraints. We use the general delay model, for which only heuristic solutions were known. We present an optimum polynomial-time algorithm for combinational circuits under this model. Our algorithm can be generalized to solve the problem under any monotone clustering constraint.

Reference-contexts: We address the problem of dividing a circuit into components so that the maximum delay at the outputs is minimized. We consider circuit partitioning with replication of nodes, i.e., a gate may be assigned to more than one component in the layout. Following <ref> [1] </ref> and [3], we refer to each such component as a cluster , and to the problem as the Circuit Clustering Problem. Lawler, Levitt and Turner [3] gave a polynomial-time optimum solution to this problem assuming the unit delay model (using the terminology of [1]). <p> Following <ref> [1] </ref> and [3], we refer to each such component as a cluster , and to the problem as the Circuit Clustering Problem. Lawler, Levitt and Turner [3] gave a polynomial-time optimum solution to this problem assuming the unit delay model (using the terminology of [1]). In this model, no delay is associated with any gate or interconnection linking two gates within a cluster. A delay of one time unit is encountered along any interconnection crossing a cluster boundary. <p> As more gates are packed onto a single chip, a path might pass through many gates, incurring a substantial delay within the chip itself. Murgai, Brayton, and Sangiovanni-Vincentelli <ref> [1] </ref> proposed the general delay model , a more realistic extension of the unit delay model. <p> For example, delay on the interconnections can be handled by adding a dummy gate (with zero area) to every interconnection, and assigning an appropriate delay to the dummy gate. This transformation increases the size of the network by a constant factor only. In <ref> [1] </ref>, Murgai, Brayton, and Sangiovanni-Vincentelli give an algorithm (referred to as the GLLT algorithm) to cluster networks with the objective of minimizing delay under the general delay model. The GLLT algorithm (based on a greedy labeling procedure) is optimum only under specific conditions. <p> Moreover, the algorithm can be generalized for any monotone clustering constraint. Our algorithm does not guarantee the minimum number of clusters in the solution with optimum delay. We can overcome this to some extent by using techniques mentioned in <ref> [1] </ref>, in a postprocessing phase to reduce the number of nodes and clusters, without changing the delay through the circuit.

Clearly the capacity constraint is a monotone clustering constraint. To solve the delay optimization problem under any monotone constraint, the labeling phase has to be changed to test for the feasibility of the cluster being computed, under the particluar clustering constraint. <p> The "pin limitation" constraint is the restriction on the number of signals that cross a cluster. Since such a constraint is a monotone constraint for both rooted and nonrooted trees <ref> [3] </ref>, our Clustering algorithm, with appropriate modifications can compute an optimum clustering solution. Unfortunately, for a general combinational network, the pin constraint is not monotone.

Reference-contexts: Proof: The computation of the matrix can be reduced to an all-pairs shortest path problem by a suitable transformation of the graph. The all-pairs shortest path problem for directed acyclic graphs can be solved in O (n (n + m)) time <ref> [4] </ref>. Sorting the nodes in topological order takes O (n + m) time. For each node v, G v can be constructed in O (n + m) time, and the nodes can be sorted according to the values of ` 0 in O (n log n) time.

Unfortunately, for a general combinational network, the pin constraint is not monotone. Cong and Ding <ref> [5] </ref> have given an optimum algorithm for a special case of clustering under pin constraints in the unit delay model, that has applications in FPGA designs. 6 Experimental Results We have implemented the Clustering algorithm in C on the SUN SPARC workstations.
