Abstract: We present a decision-theoretic model which determines whether to pre-send web documents a user is likely to request. Our model balances the cost of transmitting information with the inconvenience or cost to a user caused by having to wait for required information. It uses a Markov model built from web-access data to predict which documents are likely to be requested next. A comparative evaluation of our pre-sending scheme identifies circumstances in which our scheme is beneficial for users.

Reference-contexts: Other less easily quantified factors include the user's dissatisfaction at having to wait, and the loss of productivity while waiting for work-related information. Analysis of the WWW server information yields the following features. (1) Unlike other work done in plan recognition for domains such as the MUD <ref> [Albrecht et al., 1998] </ref> and UNIX [Lesh and Etzioni, 1995], we cannot directly observe the actions performed by a user in his/her system. 2 Our observations consist of records of visited pages (locations) in the WWW, and our aim is to predict the next location to be visited by a user.

Reference-contexts: The system described in [Raskutti et al., 1997] uses a user profile to recommend film videos; the system builds both a positive and a negative profile of the user based on his/her long term preferences and various features of the films, e.g., genre, director, producer and principal actors. WebWatcher <ref> [Armstrong et al., 1995, Joachims et al., 1997] </ref> and Letizia [Lieberman, 1995] consider several machine learning techniques to recommend links a user may wish to follow from a particular web page based on his/her interests.

Reference-contexts: DICA identifies potentially interesting changes in web pages in which a user is interested. These systems make recommendations, but they do not take any action on behalf of the user, rather they let the user determine a course of action. In contrast, the system described in <ref> [Balabanovic, 1998] </ref> considers two policies, exploitation versus exploration, to select web documents to be delivered to a user; the user's profile is represented by a linear function of the term vectors [Salton and McGill, 1983] of the documents of interest to the user.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, the system described in <ref> [Bestavros, 1996] </ref> pre-sends to a user web pages in which the user is likely to be interested. This system is the most closely related to the work described in this paper. <p> The current model considers only the prediction of the next request. In Section 8, we discuss an extension to this model which involves predictions that a document will be requested within a particular time window (such predictions are also considered in <ref> [Bestavros, 1996] </ref>). Supply Handler: The Supply Handler module sends documents to clients based on directives received from the Request Handler (in response to a direct request from a client) or from the Speculator. <p> In order to account for this situation, we intend to extend our models and evaluation procedures to cover a window of future requests as described in <ref> [Bestavros, 1996] </ref>, and incorporate a client cache profile. <p> If the transmission cost is low but the waiting cost is high, users derive more benefit from the Speculator if it pre-sends large files; this behaviour contrasts with Bestavros' speculation procedure, which gives best results when limited to documents with a maximum size of 30KB <ref> [Bestavros, 1996] </ref>. Most documents have few time-Markov successors compared to the number of documents in the database, and according to our prediction model, only successors have predicted probabilities above the 0.1 probability threshold (Section 7).

Reference-contexts: Syskill & Webert [Pazzani et al., 1996] and DICA [Starr et al., 1996] use a Bayesian Classifier <ref> [Duda and Hart, 1973] </ref> to create a user's profile from his/her preferences. In Syskill & Webert the profile is used to recommend web pages to a user, and also to construct LYCOS queries to find pages of likely interest 1 and to rate the pages returned by LYCOS.

Reference-contexts: Each arc D i ! D j has an associated weight, w (D i ; D j ), which is the frequency of the pair of successive requests across all sessions plus a small number (0.5) that corresponds to Good's flattening constant <ref> [Good, 1965] </ref>. This small number is added to adjust the frequencies for unseen requests. Let us define the set of successors of a node D i in the graph G to be succ (D i ).

Reference-contexts: These systems acquire user features relevant to a particular domain (by combining machine learning techniques with explicit knowledge elicitation from the user), and then recommend facilities or information items which are likely to be of interest to the user.
