Title: Parallel ocean circulation modeling on Cedar  
Author: L. DeRose K. Gallivan E. Gallopoulos yz A. Navarra 
Date: May 1991  
Abstract: In order to conduct faithful simulations of ocean circulation one needs considerable computational power and storage capabilities. We study the parallelization of a three-dimensional ocean circulation model (OCM) and provide summary results from recent experiments on the Cedar hierarchical architecture. A major goal of our effort is to obtain guidelines for the proper design of OCM codes for parallel architectures.

Reference-contexts: Numerical techniques are based on approximating the three-dimensional conservation equations for momentum, mass, salinity and temperature in order to understand the evolution of these fields with time. For a review of the equations and finite-difference discretizations see <ref> [2, 11] </ref>. Two difficulties of conducting ocean circulation simulations are the fine spatial resolution necessary and the requirement to perform long term simulations for meaningful climatic studies. These factors make detailed simulations costly in terms of computer time and storage. <p> the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Italy. y Center for Supercomputing Research and Development, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Illinois 61801. z Address correspondence to stratis@csrd.uiuc.edu. x Instituto per lo Studio delle Metodologie Geofisiche Ambientali-CNR, Modena, Italy. 1 are based on the primitive equations model designed by Bryan and Cox <ref> [2] </ref> were redesigned to exploit vector and, with the pioneering work of Semtner and Chervin, parallel processing [3, 10, 1, 9, 12, 4, 13].

Results were summarized in <ref> [4] </ref>. The largest amount of time was spent in computing 3D fields. 2. Data and control were partitioned to introduce parallelization. Corresponding to the flexibility of Cedar, several partitioning strategies were investigated, cf. Section 4.1. 3.

Reference-contexts: What we believe makes this effort interesting, is that the hierarchical architecture of Cedar can lead to mapping strategies suitable for different architectural configurations. These will help us deal with the scalability issues (as the size of the problem and/or the number of processors/clusters increase see for example <ref> [5] </ref> for current work on these issues in the context of the CHAMMP climate modeling program). They will also guide the design of codes, which adapt as a function of the problem parameters and of the system specifications.

Reference-contexts: They are combined with the hydrostatic approximation, the incompressibility condition, and an equation of state. These equations are written in spherical coordinates ( , , z). We refer to <ref> [8] </ref> for the boundary conditions used in the model. Second order time and space discretization is used. In space, an Arakawa B staggered grid is used. Discretization is uniform in the horizontal direction and non-uniform in the vertical. <p> The virtual disk data consists of the data structures for the 3D fields.
