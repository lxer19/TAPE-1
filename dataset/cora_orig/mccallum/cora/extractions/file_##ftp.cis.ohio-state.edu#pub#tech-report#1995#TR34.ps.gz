Reference-contexts: Let C d j be the family of all sets of R d which are the union of j or fewer convex sets. The intersection of members of C d j is not necessarily in C d j . Alon and Kalai <ref> [AK95] </ref> and independently Matousek [Matar] proved: Theorem 3 For every j; d 1 there exists an integer c (j; d) &lt; 1 such that: If A is a finite subfamily of C d j of size at least c (j; d), such that the intersection of every subfamily of A is <p> Similarly, Theorem 15 generalizes to subfamilies of C d j <ref> [AK95] </ref>: Theorem 20 For every p q d + 1 and every j &gt; 0, there exists a positive integer c (j; p; q; d) &lt; 1 such that: If A is a finite subfamily of C d j of size at least p and out of every p members of <p> Alon and Kalai gave a variant of Theorem 15 for hyperplane transversals <ref> [AK95] </ref>: Theorem 37 For every p q d + 1 there exists a positive integer c (p; q; d) &lt; 1 such that: If A is a finite family of at least p convex sets in R d and out of every p members of A some q have a hyperplane <p> It is conjectured, but not proven, that the number four in the conclusion of Theorem 39 can be reduced to three. It cannot be reduced to two.

Reference-contexts: The problem of finding a point common to n convex sets can be formulated and solved as a generalized linear programming problem. In addition, other Helly-type theorems have related algorithmic questions which can be formulated and solved as generalized linear programming problems <ref> [Ame94] </ref>. For more on linear programming and generalized linear programming, see Chapter XX. OPEN PROBLEMS 1.

Reference-contexts: If every j (d + 1) members of A have a point in common, then there is a point common to all the members of A. The value j (d + 1) cannot be reduced. A recent elegant proof of this theorem appears in <ref> [Amear] </ref>. INTERSECTIONS IN MORE THAN A POINT The following generalizations of Helly's Theorem apply to families of convex sets but strengthen both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the theorem, usually by assuming that the sets intersect in more than a single point.
