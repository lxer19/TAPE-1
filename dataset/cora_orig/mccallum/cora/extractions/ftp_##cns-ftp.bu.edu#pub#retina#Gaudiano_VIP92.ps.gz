Reference-contexts: All derivations in this section follow those of earlier articles on which the temporal adaptation model is based <ref> (e.g., Carpenter and Grossberg, 1981) </ref>, but are duplicated here for completeness. This section may be skipped on a first reading. <p> From a functional perspective, the temporal adaptation should occur at the first stages of phototransduction. As indicated earlier, an enhanced version of this law has been used to model photoreceptor dynamics <ref> (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1981) </ref>, and a heuristically derived law of form (22) has been implicated in the transduction of light into neural signals for the vertebrate rod (Pugh and Lamb, 1990).

Reference-contexts: of the model, discussing the controversial experimental findings presented in earlier sections, and outlining a number of predictions and future applications of the model. 2 Anatomy and physiology of the retina The retina of all vertebrates is organized into three cellular (or nuclear) layers and two synaptic (or plexiform) layers <ref> (Dowling, 1987) </ref>. Information flows from the photoreceptors, through a layer of bipolar cells, and finally through the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), whose axons project via the optic nerve to subcortical and cortical areas. <p> The model thus predicts that there should exist no classes of bipolar (or horizontal) cells that can give purely transient responses, a finding that receives some support in the experimental literature <ref> (e.g., chapter 4 of Dowling, 1987) </ref>. The existence of push-pull bipolar inputs to RGCs as proposed here receives some direct experimental support, though even this limited support has recently been questioned (Sterling, personal conversation).

Reference-contexts: These converging push-pull bipolar pathways coexist with and overlap the well-known diverging bipolar pathways that give rise to ON-center and OFF-center ganglion cell classes. Similar push-pull bipolar!RGC connections may also exist for the ON- and OFF-alpha RGC classes <ref> (Freed and Sterling, 1988) </ref>. The push-pull mechanism has been interpreted as a means of increasing the cone's effective dynamic range (McGuire et al., 1986; Sterling, 1990) by ensuring that excitation is accompanied by disinhibition, and vice versa.

Reference-contexts: Details and simulation results can be found elsewhere <ref> (Gaudiano, 1991a,b) </ref>. Briefly, the conclusion stems from the realization that light, as a physical quantity, must be nonnegative. As a result the shunting network exhibits an asymmetry in its response to light increments and decrements. <p> Detailed derivation of all results presented here can be found elsewhere <ref> (Gaudiano, 1991a,b) </ref>. This section may be skipped on a first reading. With reference to Fig. 5, let the input impinging upon each element of the shunting network be bounded between zero and a maximum level M . <p> This property of photoreceptor adaptation has been used <ref> (Gaudiano, 1991a,c) </ref> to show mathematically that the push-pull network can sometimes exhibit nonlinear behavior (such as frequency doubling) in response to temporal modulation of spatial stimuli, depending on the input and model parameters. 12 The null test for X and Y cells I will now present a number of illustrative simulation <p> This observation was confirmed by mathematical analysis of the push-pull network response to modulation of a bipartite field <ref> (Gaudiano, 1991a,c) </ref>. The effectiveness of edge sharpness in enhancing on-off responses can be seen in Fig. 7. The 19 parameters are the same as in earlier figures. (a): Response of a photoreceptor, X, and Y cell located at contrast edge. <p> The on-off responses at that location arise from the nonlinearity in the activation of photoreceptors on the two sides of the RGC's receptive field <ref> (Gaudiano, 1991a,c) </ref>. This result is also illustrated in Fig. 7b, which shows the response of 1-D populations of simulated X and Y cells to the same square-wave modulated bipartite field. It is apparent that Y cells at the edge exhibit a large positive-going response at both contrast reversals.

Reference-contexts: This behavior is predicted by the push-pull shunting network, because the on-off response depends on photoreceptor asymmetry, which is propagated through the bipolar receptive fields. Mathematical analyses have shown <ref> (Gaudiano, 1991c) </ref> that the existence of on-off responses depends only partially on the spatial modulation function.

Reference-contexts: Although there is general agreement that retinal cells can be subdivided into these broad classes, morphological and anatomical studies have shown the existence of a great number of cell types within each class, including dozens of RGC and amacrine cell types <ref> (e.g., Kolb et al., 1981) </ref>. In addition to morphological and anatomical classification schemes, physiological studies have shown the existence of distinct, broad functional classes. Kuffler (1953) and Barlow (1953) first reported the existence of two RGC classes: on-center (ON) and off-center (OFF) cells.

Reference-contexts: A heuristically derived law of form (22) has been used to describe the amount of free sites to which cyclic GMP can bind for transduction of light signals into neural activity in the vertebrate rod <ref> (e.g., Pugh and Lamb, 1990) </ref>. The net signal through the photoreceptor under the influence of a steady input signal is a monotone increasing function of the input signal amplitude, even though the amount of available transmitter is a monotone decreasing function of the input signal amplitude. <p> As indicated earlier, an enhanced version of this law has been used to model photoreceptor dynamics (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1981), and a heuristically derived law of form (22) has been implicated in the transduction of light into neural signals for the vertebrate rod <ref> (Pugh and Lamb, 1990) </ref>. However, the transient overshoots and undershoots observed at and beyond the bipolar cell layer may be faster and more pronounced than those found in the photoreceptors.

Reference-contexts: Cone activation has opposite effects on each bipolar within a pair, and there is evidence that the bipolars within each pair in turn have opposite effects on the RGC they contact <ref> (Sterling, 1990) </ref>. These converging push-pull bipolar pathways coexist with and overlap the well-known diverging bipolar pathways that give rise to ON-center and OFF-center ganglion cell classes. Similar push-pull bipolar!RGC connections may also exist for the ON- and OFF-alpha RGC classes (Freed and Sterling, 1988). <p> This assumption is based on the experimental observation that the primary morphological difference between X (beta) and Y (alpha) is not simply overall receptive field size, but rather the relationship between receptive field center and surround widths: it has generally been noted <ref> (e.g., Sterling, 1990) </ref> that in the beta cell the receptive field center is 18 significantly narrower than the surround, whereas in alpha cells the width of the receptive field center is much closer to that of the surround.

Reference-contexts: Grossberg (1980) has also shown that the region of maximal sensitivity of a cell obeying (1) shifts without compression as the background intensity is parametrically increased. This is known as the shift property, which has been demonstrated experimentally for certain classes of retinal cells <ref> (Werblin, 1971) </ref>. Similar results ensue when the center-surround mechanism consists of distinct, overlapping center and surround components, as shown in Fig. 3b.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, stimulation of the receptive field surround decreases activation in the ON cells, and increases activation in OFF cells. The distinct response characteristics of ON and OFF RGCs appear to originate in the bipolar cell layer <ref> (Werblin and Dowling, 1969) </ref>.
