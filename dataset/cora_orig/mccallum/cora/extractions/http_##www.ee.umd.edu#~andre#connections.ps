Abstract: The main contribution of the paper is to show the equivalence between the following two approaches for obtaining sufficient conditions for the robust stability of systems with structured uncertainties: (i) apply the classical absolute stability theory with multipliers; (ii) use modern theory, specifically, the upper bound obtained by Fan, Tits and Doyle [IEEE TAC, Vol. 36, 25-38]. In particular, the relationship between the stability multipliers used in absolute stability theory and the scaling matrices used in the cited reference is explicitly characterized. The development hinges on the derivation of certain properties of a parameterized family of complex LMIs (linear matrix inequalities), a result of independent interest. The derivation also suggests a general computational framework for checking the feasibility of a broad class of frequency-dependent conditions, based on which bisection schemes can be devised to reliably compute several quantities of interest for robust control.

This problem has received considerable attention over the years, and a number of sufficient conditions for stability have been proposed; perhaps the most celebrated of these have been the circle and Popov criteria.

A simple bisection scheme can then be implemented, combining these bounds, to compute kP k ^ to any arbitrary accuracy. 5 Synopsis of the Continuous-Time Case Continuous-time analogues of Proposition 2.1 and Theorem 3.2 are easily obtained.

Reference-contexts: The inequality symbol indicates positive definiteness. LMIs (1) are widely encountered in system and control theory and their applications; see, for example <ref> [22] </ref>. In this section, we consider a parametrized family of LMIs, every element of which is of the form (1).

The first step here is to restrict the functions of frequency that are the optimization variables in the original frequency-domain condition to lie in a finite-dimensional subspace.
