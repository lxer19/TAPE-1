Abstract: The predominant use of point-to-point communication protocols on the global Internet, combined with the communication patterns imposed by the World Wide Web, make inefficient use of the Internet's increasingly scarce network bandwidth. While more network fiber helps to belay the impact of these inefficiencies, ultimately more intelligent coordination of data distribution and the use of more efficient distribution protocols will be necessary to support the user population of the Information Superhighway. To this end, we propose the notion of Information Servers. Using the publish-subscribe paradigm,

Reference-contexts: While considerable attention is focused on the appearance of information, as display languages such as HTML and Java are introduced and refined, insufficient attention is being given to how data is transmitted. The use of RPC-style communication is well suited for interactive World Wide Web <ref> [1] </ref> use; however, the span of this communication is too wide. As users interact with the Web, their browsers repeatedly communicate with Web data sources to fetch text, images, and sounds.

Reference-contexts: The service is responsible for disseminating the information to all subscribers who have registered an interest in this subject group. The notion of publish-subscribe is already familiar to users of the Internet. In the Network News protocol <ref> [3] </ref>, a person (or process) wishing to announce some piece of information to a subset of the world does so by posting an article to a subject group.

Reference-contexts: Another example of the usefulness of the publish-subscribe paradigm for handling data distribution to a large community is the Multicast Backbone or Mbone <ref> [4] </ref>. The Mbone demonstrates the capability of the existing Internet to support audio and video conferencing through the combination of hardware multicast and tunneling. However, the success of this system is currently achieved through coordinated and planned scheduling of network resources.

Reference-contexts: This system is perhaps the largest example of a publish-subscribe communication system and while its implementation needs modernizing to reduce inefficiencies, it has served its large community well. Recently, the Web has taken over as the dominant source of traffic on the Internet <ref> [5] </ref>. With its simple interface, the Web has literally brought the world to the user with a click of a button. The traffic patterns 2 caused by this phenomenon are not nearly as coordinated, predictable, or broad serving as the distribution methods of Network News.
