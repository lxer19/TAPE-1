Title: Game Theory and Active Learning  
Author: Dean Foster Rick Vohra 
Address: Pennsylvania  
Affiliation: University of  Ohio State University  
Abstract: In the last couple of years there has been a spurt of interest in the subject of learning how to play a games. This learning consists of playing the same opponent over and over again (or possible a sequence of opponents). With each repeat of the game, hopefully play improves. In this note we discuss some of the empirical research from observing people play games and some theoretical research on how they might be played. We will also describe a computer tournament which ends before the the start of symposium.
