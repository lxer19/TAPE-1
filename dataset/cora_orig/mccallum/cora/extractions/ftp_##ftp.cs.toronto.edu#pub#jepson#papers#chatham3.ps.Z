Abstract: Visual perception is the process of inferring world structure from image structure. If the world structure we recover from our images "makes sense" as a plausible world event, then we have a "percept" and can often offer a concise linguistic description of what we see. For example, in the upper panel of Figure 3.1, if asked, "What do you see?", a typical response might be a pillbox with a handle either erect (left) or flat (right). This concise and confident response suggests that we have identified a model type that fits the image observation with no residual ambiguities at the level of the description. In contrast, when asked to describe the two lower drawings in Figure 3.1, there is some hesitancy and uncertainty. Is the handle erect or not? Does it have a skewed or rectangular shape? The depiction leaves us somewhat uncertain, as if several options were possible, but none where all aspects of the interpretation collectively support each other. What then, leads us to the certainty in the upper set and to the ambiguity in the lower pair? To be a bit more precise about our goal, let us assume that some Waltz-like algorithm has already identified the base of the pillbox and the wire-frame handle as separate 3D parts. Even with this decomposition, there remains an infinity of possible interpretations for any of these drawings. Yet we confidently commit to one interpretation in the case of the upper panel, but otherwise for the lower pair. Our aim, then, is to understand why the image structures in the upper panel support the assertion that they must arise only from very particular world structures, whereas the lower two structures seem more ambiguous. Our analysis will consist of three parts: first we will lay out the domain associated with pillboxes having handles. Then the role of preferences for

For the pillbox and handle, we have two "parts" and hence two coordinate frames. Let us specify the coordinate frame for the pillbox by its symmetry axis A, and by the feet 86 W. Richards, A.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the essence of the priors is captured by the preference relations without the need to assume complex relationships based on probability density functions, utility factors, etc. <ref> (Arrow, 1963) </ref>. Although we lose statistical optimality, we gain a robustness over contexts. The use and form of the preferences, then, are more akin to Bennett & Hoffman's Boolean Lebesque logic, than they are to statistical estimation procedures.

Reference-contexts: A possible source of such a prior might be from viewing line drawings, where the bisector rule could appear modally as a convention. Alternatively, it may arise as a consequence of a heuristic such as minimum slant <ref> (Kanade, 1983) </ref>. In either case, if our perceptual system is Bayesian, then the priors on the possible viewpoints of Figure 3.1 appear to be biased in favour of the "modal" bisector rule, and moreover this bias is unfair relative to a uniform distribution of viewpoints. 3.7 Preference lattices vs.

Reference-contexts: Notice that the causal explanation behind each of these stable configurations is not necessarily known to the perceiver. Rather, the point is that the perceiver has reason to believe that some such explanation is likely to exist <ref> (MacKay, 1978) </ref>. Conversely, if a causal force (like gravity) is known, then the perceiver is justified in placing a high prior on a configuration that this causal force will tend to produce (like the flat handle).
