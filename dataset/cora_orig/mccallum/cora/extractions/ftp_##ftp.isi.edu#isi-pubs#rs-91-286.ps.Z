Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multimedia conferencing has come of age. Or, has it? Proponents of teleconferencing have made statements like this since as early as the 1920's when the idea of video conferencing debuted [20], and echoed this pronouncement again during the 1960's when AT&T introduced its PicturePhone <ref> [3] </ref> at the 1964 World's Fair. Marketing forecasts of the 1970's promised the teleconferencing revolution [35] and touted "videoconferencing as a revolutionary concept on the brink of success" [9]. One must wonder, are these assertions any more true now than they were then? Teleconferencing is hardly a novel concept. <p> Cruiser's sensible range of social protocols (from "anyone may drop in" to "no one is to bother me") serve to offset Orwellian reactions to the presence of cameras <ref> [3, 9, 39] </ref>. 5 New Technology Technology advances at a rapid pace. We now expect workstations to come with a mouse. We are beginning to expect workstations to come with audio.

Reference-contexts: Bikson lobbies for systems more attuned to group processes, taking the stance that system builders must consider the tools and technology already in place, as well as individual preferences <ref> [4] </ref>. Despite valid skepticism, multimedia conferencing continues to be an active research area with a diversity of systems being developed for a variety of situations. In particular, multimedia conferencing is central to the idea of the Collaboratory, an electronic environment for conducting science. <p> With familiarity come spontaneity and informality, both ingredients for making an environment conducive for collaborations. Similar arguments are made by those who favor conferencing systems that allow one's usual collection of desktop tools to be used <ref> [4, 9, 17] </ref>. Cognitive overload. Designers of the Capture Lab were worried about the impact of simultaneous typing, that the "cognitive load" would be too high for participants to carry on useful conversations if everyone could enter data at the same time.

Reference-contexts: We note the variation in capabilities, architecture and results gleaned from each. Many of the projects in the last decade have been inspired by the seminal ideas of Bush, whose hypothetical Memex <ref> [5] </ref> predates today's hypertext systems as multi-user repositories of information. To an even larger degree many were influenced by Engelbart, whose NLS/AUGMENT [12, 11] was one of the first systems to use computers for group collaboration.

Reference-contexts: the attitude only-interrupt-me-if-its-my-boss have corollaries in the electronic realm, as do purely technology-age phenomena such as answering machine tag. 3.6 The DARPA Multimedia Conferencing Project The Multimedia Conferencing (MMC) project, a collaborative effort between ISI and BBN STC under DARPA sponsorship, has developed an experimental system for real-time, multisite conferences <ref> [6, 33] </ref>. While some conferencing projects have focused on issues for same-room conferencing, and others have concentrated on inter-office conferencing over LANs, our work has instead targeted remote conferencing across transcontinental packet-switched networks. <p> Packet switching technology promises to allow improvement of video quality by efficiently supporting variable-rate video coding. Its inherent multiplexing of multiple streams also allows more efficient multi-destination delivery for N-way conferencing <ref> [6] </ref>. However, most video codecs are designed for dedicated circuits, so part of the work for MMC was to adapt these codecs to packet switching. -5 A disadvantage of packet-switching is the potential for an increase in communication delay. <p> This network infrastructure in combination with video capabilities in the workstation will enable widespread multimedia conferencing, to support projects such as the Collaboratory. Support for real-time data over these networks will require real-time communication protocols similar to those the MMC project has developed <ref> [6, 38] </ref>. These protocols provide for low delay transmission and multicast delivery for multisite conferences. Multicast delivery is also valuable for non-real-time protocols [8] used in groupware applications. 6 Conclusions Technology alone cannot transform electronic conferencing into an accepted or widespread form of communication.

Most multimedia conferencing systems include computer-based tools to support group collaboration, or groupware [7, 11, 12, 23].

The centralized approach is based on the execution of the application at one site with input forwarded from whichever site has the floor to the site where the application executes and all output broadcast to the other sites. <p> Input from the site with the floor is broadcast to the other participating sites and output is generated locally at each site. Replicated systems minimize the input to output delay for the participant with the floor, but are harder to construct <ref> [7, 24] </ref>. Within groupware applications, a range of floor policies are used. Some systems allow simultaneous access to the shared workspace by multiple users [36], while others only allow one user to alter the work area at a time [7, 23]. <p> Within groupware applications, a range of floor policies are used.

Reference-contexts: Marketing forecasts of the 1970's promised the teleconferencing revolution [35] and touted "videoconferencing as a revolutionary concept on the brink of success" <ref> [9] </ref>. One must wonder, are these assertions any more true now than they were then? Teleconferencing is hardly a novel concept. Yet, it has consistently fallen short of expectations as an effective means of communication. <p> Egido's articulate discussion of its failures points to factors lying beyond the scope of technology, such as psychological and sociological ones, and argues that the casting of electronic communication in the image of face-to-face meetings has stood in the way of developing multimedia conferencing technology to its fullest potential <ref> [9] </ref>. Bikson lobbies for systems more attuned to group processes, taking the stance that system builders must consider the tools and technology already in place, as well as individual preferences [4]. <p> Inter-office conferencing will allow individuals to be surrounded by their usual assemblage of working tools, reference materials, and other familiar resources. The MMC project is moving towards personal conferencing by porting the real-time processing components of the system onto a workstation. Although some studies <ref> [9] </ref> indicate a preference for inter-office conferencing over conference room teleconferencing, meeting room style conferencing also has its place. <p> With familiarity come spontaneity and informality, both ingredients for making an environment conducive for collaborations.

Although some studies have pointed to the dubious nature of adding a visual channel, others have found there is more of a demand for video if it can be provided cheaply enough <ref> [9] </ref>. Video acts not only as a means of viewing remote co-workers, but also as a means for providing the three dimensional equivalent of a scanner or facsimile. <p> Because the successful existing systems span a wide range of audio and video quality, it would appear that acceptance of these systems has more to do with "the nature of the intended application than with the details of technical quality" <ref> [9] </ref>. Communication delays. Concern about minimizing communication delays seems to come in two flavors: concern about delays for collaborative tools to propagate updates to all sites, and about end-to-end delay of real-time media. Minimizing interaction delay is at the root of the centralized versus replicated debate for computer conferencing architectures. <p> Cruiser's sensible range of social protocols (from "anyone may drop in" to "no one is to bother me") serve to offset Orwellian reactions to the presence of cameras <ref> [3, 9, 39] </ref>. 5 New Technology Technology advances at a rapid pace.

Reference-contexts: The current project grew out of an initial interest during the 1970's in research on packet transmission of voice. This evolved into an interest in packet-switched video as a good application for stressing the network. The system relies on an experimental suite of protocols for real-time data <ref> [13, 38] </ref> and the underlying experimental Terrestrial Wideband Network (TWBnet). Packet switching technology promises to allow improvement of video quality by efficiently supporting variable-rate video coding. Its inherent multiplexing of multiple streams also allows more efficient multi-destination delivery for N-way conferencing [6].

Lastly, they found that more formal meetings with a designated scribe generally broke down into rotating scribe meetings. 3.3 MMConf BBN's MMConf system <ref> [7, 14] </ref> differs from the Colab and Capture Lab projects in that it was designed to accommodate remote conferencing -- distributed, real-time group interactions of an inter-office or inter-meeting-room nature. <p> This was certainly found to be the case at ISI, where groups of users convene in a special meeting room and then conference between meeting rooms sharing a group account. Comments about the need for simplicity were in reaction to a sophisticated -6 multimedia editor <ref> [14] </ref> that was the original multi-user application provided with the system. Surprisingly, the criticism was aimed at its wonderfully rich functionality. Many users preferred an interface they could intuitively operate (e.g., draw with the mouse, click on the screen to change cursor position, enter text by simply typing).

Reference-contexts: This was also evidenced at Colab by the distillation of one of the original applications into a simpler version with little to no use of menus <ref> [15] </ref>. Flexibility. Different kinds of meetings will arise. They will call for a variety of applications, different levels of sophistication among users, and a range of floor control options. <p> Recognizing the diversity of meeting situations and audiences, Colab developers had designed a range of tools from formal to informal, resulting in a total of 16-18 applications as of August 1989 <ref> [15] </ref>. Similarly, the latest version of MMConf now offers a choice of floor policy options. In short, it is necessary to offer interfaces that are appropriate for the different usages of conferencing systems. Necessity of real-time media. Remote conferencing is impractical without some form of real-time voice communication. <p> Technology and human factors. Foster states "the mission of the Colab project is how computers can make groups more effective at their work" and that this requires an awareness of the interplay between technology and -7 group productivity <ref> [15] </ref>. Details as seemingly unimportant as inter-participant viewing and changes to room accoutrements effected acceptance of the Capture Lab system. Video monitor height and the size of video images figure into people's receptiveness to the MMC teleconferencing system.

Reference-contexts: Large-format monitors were placed in common areas and limited office-to-office connectivity was provided through switching. Preliminary data indicated that 70% of all communications were of a casual, drop-in nature, with users reporting that most probably would not have occurred in the absence of the video link <ref> [16] </ref>. Roughly two-thirds of all interactions were primarily technical in nature, the remainder being social [31].

Reference-contexts: However, Cruiser caters not so much to continuous audio-video presence, but rather to personal conferencing, where individuals rendezvous as desired. The motivations for the Cruiser project were studies that suggest physical proximity between scientific researchers leads to research collaborations <ref> [21] </ref>. The notion is that physical proximity invites frequent and spontaneous communication that in turn often initiates collaboration. The correlation is even found to extend to informal encounters, of a social nature. <p> However, the 56 Kbps digital video channel was considered insufficient for crucial aspects of joint work, such as detailed collaboration or delicate negotiation <ref> [21] </ref>. Audio ambiance is perhaps even more important than video quality because most information is carried in the audio channel. First reactions to the MMC system often include favorable comments on audio quality, and in particular on the ability of all sites to generate and hear audio simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the most basic division is between synchronous and asynchronous conferencing. While both forms of conferencing cater to multiple users, synchronous conferencing is intended for simultaneous users who have real-time interactions, while asynchronous conferencing systems, such as multimedia electronic mail [29] and structured -1 messaging systems <ref> [22] </ref>, provide non-real-time communication. In this paper, we concentrate our discussion on synchronous conferencing systems.

Reference-contexts: The current project grew out of an initial interest during the 1970's in research on packet transmission of voice. This evolved into an interest in packet-switched video as a good application for stressing the network. The system relies on an experimental suite of protocols for real-time data <ref> [13, 38] </ref> and the underlying experimental Terrestrial Wideband Network (TWBnet). Packet switching technology promises to allow improvement of video quality by efficiently supporting variable-rate video coding. Its inherent multiplexing of multiple streams also allows more efficient multi-destination delivery for N-way conferencing [6]. <p> This network infrastructure in combination with video capabilities in the workstation will enable widespread multimedia conferencing, to support projects such as the Collaboratory. Support for real-time data over these networks will require real-time communication protocols similar to those the MMC project has developed <ref> [6, 38] </ref>. These protocols provide for low delay transmission and multicast delivery for multisite conferences. Multicast delivery is also valuable for non-real-time protocols [8] used in groupware applications. 6 Conclusions Technology alone cannot transform electronic conferencing into an accepted or widespread form of communication.
