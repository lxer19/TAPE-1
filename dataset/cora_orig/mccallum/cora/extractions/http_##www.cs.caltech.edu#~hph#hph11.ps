Reference-contexts: Introduction We present a proof of a mutual exclusion algorithm by Haldar and Subramanian <ref> [1] </ref>. The original operational reasoning did not convince us of the correctness of the algorithm and even though the reasoning was improved upon in [2], we feel our proof is an improvement over both.

Reference-contexts: Introduction We present a proof of a mutual exclusion algorithm by Haldar and Subramanian [1]. The original operational reasoning did not convince us of the correctness of the algorithm and even though the reasoning was improved upon in <ref> [2] </ref>, we feel our proof is an improvement over both. For our proof we use the formalization of Dijkstra's P and V operations on (unfair) semaphores introduced by Martin [3].
