Abstract: Shape from Motion data fusion brings a greater degree of autonomy and sensor integration to intelligent systems in which fusion by constant linear transformations is appropriate. To illustrate this, we apply Shape from Motion techniques to applications involving both similar and disparate sensory information vectors. First, nearly autonomous force/torque sensor calibration is demonstrated through fusion of the individual channels of raw strain gauge data. Gathering only the raw sensor signals, the motion of the force vector (the motion) and the calibration matrix (the shape) are simultaneously extracted by singular value decomposition. This calibration example is provided to simply explain the mathematics. Disparate sensory information is fused in a primordial learning mobile robot through a similar eigenspace representation. This paper summarizes these shape from motion applications and presents an extension for simultaneously extracting sensor bias.

Reference-contexts: A few researchers have attempted to formalize the least squares calibration process in terms of SVD. Uchiyama, et al [11] have done the most comprehensive treatment along this vein, but Bicchi and Dario <ref> [1] </ref> provided early foundations. These formalizations still require complete input and output data sets, unlike Shape from Motion. 4 Algorithmic Details 4.1 The Calibration Problem A sensor converts an applied load, , into a measurement vector, z (Figure 2).

Reference-contexts: This topic is beyond the scope of this work and is better left to the classical references in the field such as <ref> [2] </ref>. Suffice it to say, no volume of additional data can make up for poor experiment design and shape from motion calibration is no exception. The success of the technique is dependent on proper excitation of the measurement space.

Reference-contexts: The shape from motion technique is modified to match the principal component analyses of Hancock and Thorpe <ref> [4] </ref> and Pierce [7]. The standard principal components analysis provides a substitute for the geometric constraint used in equation (14). For primordial learning, we do not wish to constrain the problem. <p> The training data was batch-processed using SVD to extract the eigenvectors and selected the largest n eigenvectors using the largest ratio of adjacent singular values as the threshold for n. For run-time operation (sensor fusion in real-time), the new sensor image is projected onto the eigenspace as described in <ref> [4] </ref>. Using this technique, the real robot achieved both wandering behavior and escaped stalls and collisions without highly redundant or correlated sensors and with no algorithmic structure imposed on the learned result.
