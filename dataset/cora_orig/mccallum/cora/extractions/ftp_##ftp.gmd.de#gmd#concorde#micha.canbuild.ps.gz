Title: CAN-BUILD Solving the Can-Build Problem Using Constraint Logic Programming  
Author: Michael Nitsche 
Address: FIRST, Rudower Chaussee 5, 12489 Berlin, Germany  
Affiliation: GMD  
Abstract: Solving the can-build problem | a subtask of Materials Requirements Planning | means establishing an executable production plan when constraints on the availability of resources occur. This paper investigates how Constraint Logic Programming can be used to solve this real-world problem. An algorithm is presented that returns the most general solution according to those constraints which are known explicitly. Since this solution cannot be used directly in a planning tool, we investigate how the user can be supported to understand, analyse and refine the constraint answer set maintaining his domain and technical terms. An interactive decision support mechanism has been provided that allows to add management information and intuitive knowledge by specifying constraints implicitly via a command interpreter. fl This paper is a collected and revised version of [Nitsche 94a] and [Nitsche 94b].

Reference-contexts: We have therefore confined our investigations to one particular system | Hewlett- Packard's I-MRP tool (for Interactive Materials Requirements Planning), which was developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Bristol, as a decision support system for use in the planning process <ref> [HP 92a, HP 92b] </ref>. In order to be able to supply the user with the information needed, the system has to access various basic data, which is stored in external databases. Basically, there are two types of data | product-related data and planning-related data.

Reference-contexts: During the development of a commercial MRP system, we have investigated the feasibility of solving can-build problems using Constraint Logic Pro- gramming <ref> [Jaffar 87a] </ref>. This means applying an advanced Logic Programming technique to a real-world problem and | to our knowledge | has not been done before.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, the output constraints will only involve target variables (i.e. those variables contained in the query) and be free of redundancy, but this is not always possible. In general, eliminating redundancies from a set of linear arithmetic constraints is a nontrivial problem <ref> [Lassez 89] </ref>. Since certain properties hold for the constraint set returned by the can-build algorithm, we can remove most redundancies using a quite simple algorithm.
