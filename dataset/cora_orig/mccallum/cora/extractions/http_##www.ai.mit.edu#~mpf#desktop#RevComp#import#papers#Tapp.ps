Abstract: This paper describes the simulation of an S(n) space-bounded deterministic Turing machine by a reversible Turing machine operating in space S(n). It thus answers a question posed by Bennett in 1989 and refutes the conjecture, made by Li and Vitanyi in 1996, that any reversible simulation of an irreversible computation must obey Bennett's reversible pebble game rules.

Following Bennett <ref> [Be89] </ref>, we impose the following restrictions on the transitions of a Turing machine and claim that these are sufficient to imply reversibility. We restrict the transitions to be of one of the two following types: either the head is not moving, or the tape is not modified. <p> Since spoiled memory is no longer useful, it is important that the memory be restored to its initial state at the end of a reversible computation. Two notions of memory "cleanliness" have been studied in the literature: These correspond to input-saving and to input-erasing Turing machines <ref> [Be89] </ref>. In an input-saving computation, the final tape content is #x#f (x)#. In an input-erasing computation, only f (x) remains on the tape. The latter notion was only considered useful when f is injective. <p> It is interesting to compare this with the equivalence of deterministic time and reversible time, which is simply shown by storing the whole computational history on a separate write-only tape <ref> [Le63, Be89] </ref>. It is remarkable that this is the very same construction which proves the equivalence of nondeterministic time and symmetric 1 time [LePa82].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A Turing machine M is reversible iff the infinite graph of all configurations of M has indegree one. Interest in reversibility arose at first in connection with the thermodynamics of computation, following Landauer's demonstration in 1961 that, contrary to earlier intuition (see <ref> [Bu66] </ref>), physical laws do not preclude using an arbitrarily small amount of energy to perform logically reversible computing steps [La61]. More recently, renewed interest in the notion of reversibility was sparked by the prospect of quantum computers, whose observation-free computational steps are intrinsically reversible [De85, Sh94, Br95].

Reference-contexts: situations in which space is the only resource of interest: For example, it is not clear that quantum computing forbids the effective use of exponential "parallel hardware" (hardware size being the parallel complexity measure which corresponds to the sequential time measure by the so-called parallel computation thesis, see for instance <ref> [Co85] </ref>), so that a quantum computer could take advantage of our space-efficient reversible simulation. Section 2 in this abstract contains preliminaries and discusses the notion of reversibility.

Reference-contexts: The difficulty is to ensure reversibility of R at the transition function level. To simplify the presentation of the machine R, we will make use of a construction developed in <ref> [CoMc87] </ref> for the purpose of showing that permutation representation problems and tree traversal problems are logspace-complete. We now recall this construction. <p> Although we have described the construction of T and T in the context of a simple example, the construction as it applies to a general tree T should be clear. Among the properties of T T proved in <ref> [CoMc87] </ref>, we will only make use of the property that T T is a single cycle which includes precisely all the elements in T . Our reversible Turing machine R will simulate the computation of G w G w .

Reference-contexts: It is remarkable that this is the very same construction which proves the equivalence of nondeterministic time and symmetric 1 time <ref> [LePa82] </ref>. This duality of the pairs non-determinism versus symmetry and determinism versus reversibility is tied to the question of whether transitions can be regarded as directed or as undirected: This makes no difference if the indegree of every configuration is at most one.
