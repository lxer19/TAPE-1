Abstract: We describe the Phase-Space Nonlinear Control Toolbox, a suite of computational tools for synthesizing, evaluating, and verifying control laws for a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems. The Toolbox comprises computational algorithms for identifying optimal control reference trajectories in the phase space of dynamical systems, experimental methods for evaluating performance of the control laws, and algorithms for verifying correct behaviors of the synthesized control laws. These algorithms combine knowledge of the geometric theory of modern nonlinear dynamical systems with efficient computational methods for geometric reasoning and graph search. They define the properties of controllability and robustness in terms of phase-space geometric structures and exploit the phase-space neighborhood adjacencies to obtain computational efficiency. They evolve a hierarchically-refined bound of system nonlinear dynamics during verification and can address practical concerns such as sensor, actuator, and modeling uncertainties in a systematic manner. Compared to the traditional analytic control design methods, the phase-space based control synthesis

In hybrid systems terms (see e.g. <ref> [6] </ref>), each cell can be thought of as a discrete state, and the bounding polytope is determined by approximating system dynamics with a rectangular differential inclusion. In step 3, we are checking for two properties: 1. 8x 2 c : f n (x) =2 c for some n 2 N. <p> Additionally, the structure permits programmed trade-offs between computation and control quality.
