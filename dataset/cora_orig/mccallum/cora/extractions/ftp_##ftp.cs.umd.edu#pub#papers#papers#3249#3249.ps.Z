Abstract: Most common sense reasoning formalisms do not account for the passage of time as the reasoning occurs, and hence are inadequate from the point of view of modeling an agent's ongoing process of reasoning. We present a modal active-logic that treats time as a valuable resource that is consumed in each step of the agent's reasoning. We provide a sound and complete characterization for this logic and examine how it addresses the problem of logical omniscience.

Reference-contexts: In section 5 we examine how our approach addresses the logical omniscience problem and summarize our contribution. 2 The various aspects of omniscience and its treatment Fagin and Halpern <ref> [FH88] </ref> have analyzed what is meant by the notion of logical omniscience. They define an agent to be logically omniscient if whenever he believes formulas in a set , and logically implies the formula , then the agent also believes . <p> However, we provide the distinction of incorporating time-situatedness. Vardi [Var86] provides a co-relation between restrictions on models in the Montague semantics and the corresponding agent properties that they characterize. Fagin and Halpern <ref> [FH88] </ref> have presented a series of interesting approaches to limited reasoning that marry the syntactic and semantic approaches. They provide an extension to Levesque's approach for the multi-agent case, and introduce a notion of awareness. <p> The agent also believes only those tautologies that are in G. Hence the scope of (b) and (c) is reduced in the modified structure. The agent's language G has similarities to the awareness set concept of <ref> [FH88] </ref>. <p> In our logic, by (R2), it takes an agent one period of time to deduce the consequence. 12 considers multiagent belief operators B i without a time parameter then a modified version of Axioms (A2), (A4) and (R4) from figure 4 are true in the model of local reasoning of <ref> [FH88] </ref>, (without modalities for implicit belief). Note, that we have only explicit beliefs, and there is no notion of implicit beliefs. In [FH88] the models are still static, in that even though they suggest incorporating reasoning about time, and changing awareness functions, there is no way to account for inference time <p> B i without a time parameter then a modified version of Axioms (A2), (A4) and (R4) from figure 4 are true in the model of local reasoning of <ref> [FH88] </ref>, (without modalities for implicit belief).

In [FH88] the models are still static, in that even though they suggest incorporating reasoning about time, and changing awareness functions, there is no way to account for inference time in their models. Parallels to more advanced step-logics for planning and default reasoning have also been developed.

Reference-contexts: Resource limitations have been of some concern in formal work. In particular, the problem of logical omniscience has received attention in the epistemic logic literature. It concerns the difficulty with the classical Hintikka possible world semantics <ref> [Hin62] </ref> that the agent always knows the logical consequences of her beliefs. However, no existing works provide a semantics addressing the issue of how the reasoning progresses vis a vis the passage of time. <p> Domain specific axioms describe the particular instance of the planning problem. A limited-memory model that addresses two other resources of value: space and parallelism has been integrated into the deadline-coupled reasoning. 3 formulas, namely, if is valid, then is believed. The agent in the classical model of knowledge <ref> [Hin62] </ref> has all the undesirable properties (a), (b) and (c) above. Several improvements have been suggested, and they have been broadly classified as "syntactic" and "semantic" approaches.

Reference-contexts: The proof of completeness hinges on the definition of a canonical model M c in which every consistent 10 formula is satisfiable. In M c we have a timeline corresponding to every maximal consistent set V . For definition and properties of maximal consistent sets we refer to <ref> [HY92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: They have since been extended and renamed as active logics. In <ref> [KNP90, NKP91, NKP93] </ref> the step-logic framework is used to create an active logic based fully deadline-coupled planning and reasoning mechanism which is a combination of declarative and procedural approaches that is capable of solving the above mentioned problems 1 .

Reference-contexts: But such approaches are difficult to analyze, since they are not guided by knowledge-based principles. A commendable syntactic approach is presented by Konolige in his deduction model <ref> [Kon83] </ref> which gives a formal characterization of explicit beliefs and captures how agents syntactically derive new beliefs, possibly with an incomplete set of inference rules. In contrast, semantic approaches attempt to give semantics similar in most cases to the possible world semantics, but with "fixes".

Reference-contexts: They also provide an approach to local reasoning that they call a society of minds approach. Fagin and Halpern's awareness notion, in their logic of general awareness acts like a filter on semantic formulations. It has been evaluated and criticized in <ref> [Kon86] </ref>. One of the criticisms is that the model is unintuitive, since it is unlikely that an agent can compute all logical consequences, discarding the one's that it is not aware of, say, because of memory limitations, because in fact, agents are also affected by time limitations.

Reference-contexts: Levesque's approach was subject to the criticism that an agent in the logic is a perfect reasoner in relevance logic. Levesque's ideas have been extended in [PS85] and <ref> [Lak86] </ref>. Montague has given a possible world semantics that gets around problem (a) of logical consequence. We use the main idea in this model, namely, to define knowledge as a relation between a world and a set of sets of possible worlds. However, we provide the distinction of incorporating time-situatedness.
