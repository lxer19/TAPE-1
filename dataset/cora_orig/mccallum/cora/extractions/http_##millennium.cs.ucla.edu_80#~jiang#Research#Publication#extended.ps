Abstract: where, the same as in our previous analysis, c 1 = ff B s + ff T ff B into (15), we obtain a value H 0 . Now we consider another system with the same b, s, , and ff T ff B . When the user is using a file, for each file in the new system, we set its access probability to H 0 if and only if it is at least H 0 when the same file is being used in the original system, otherwise we set it to 0. Since two system have the same b; s; and ff T , the prefetch threshold for the new system is H 0 by (15). This implies that the average cost of a user request can be minimized by prefetching all the files with access probability H 0 . In this new system, let 2 be the corresponding prefetch request rate at which the cost is minimized. By our definition of the new system and the result in section 3.2, it is given by 2 = ff T (s H 0 b) for 0 2 2 . Based on equations (21) and (22), we take the derivative of equation (23) with respect to 2 to obtain that dC( 2 ) ff B
