Title: The Composition Effect in Symbolizing: The Role of Symbol Production vs. Text Comprehension

Abstract: A person's ability to translate a mathematical problem into symbols is an increasingly important skill as computational devices play an increasing role in academia and the workplace. Thus it is important to better understand this "symbolization" skill and how it develops. We are working toward a model of the acquisition of skill at symbolizing and scaffolding strategies for assisting that acquisition. We are using a difficulties factors assessment as an efficient methodology for identifying the critical cognitive factors that distinguish competent from less competent symbolizers. The current study indicates there is more to symbolizing than translating individual phrases into symbols and using long-term schematic knowledge to fill in implied information. In particular, students must be able to compose these individual translation operations into a complete symbolic sentence. We provide evidence that in contrast to many prior models of word problem solving which address story comprehension skills, a critical element of student competence is symbolic production skills.

Reference-contexts: We hypothesize that many students start their study of algebra with knowledge components (e.g., ACT-R production rules <ref> (Anderson 1993) </ref>) that enable them to symbolize only one operator problems because their production rules only allow for single numerals or variables (e.g., 40 or m) to be used as arguments to the mathematical operators, as opposed to whole subexpressions (e.g., 40*m or 800-x).

Reference-contexts: After answering these concrete arithmetic problems, students were asked to write the symbolic expression. Students in this inductive support tutor were shown to learn more than students using an alternative "textbook" tutor. The tutor's design was adapted based on this study so that the current tutor <ref> (Koedinger, Anderson, Hadley, Mark, 1995) </ref> has a "Pattern Finder" component where, rather than just answering these concrete questions, students are asked to show how to get answers for successive small values of x, namely, 2, 3, and 4.

Reference-contexts: The use of the equals sign in this example appears to grow out of the way students use the equal sign as "gives" in elementary arithmetic in which it is not uncommon to see students chain together steps with equal sign like 3*4=12-5=7 <ref> (Sfard, et. al., 1993) </ref>. Since 72-m can not be simplified the student uses a new variable "n" to stand for the result and then continues. Our goal is to better understand what these symbol production skills are and how students might better learn them.
