Abstract: Knowledge discovery in databases can be enhanced by the introduction of "catalytic relations" conveying external common sense knowledge. The new information catalyzes database inference and manifests new facts, rules, and latent inference channels. This paper presents a formalism for modeling and analyzing imprecise inference based on functional dependencies (FDs) in "mixed" databases containing precise, imprecise, and fuzzy relations. The ability to deal with mixed databases is important. It allows common knowledge, typically expressed in imprecise or fuzzy terms, to be introduced to catalyze inference in precise databases. The inference formalism is flexible and robust, and has applications in database mining and database security control.

Reference-contexts: Imprecise information is represented by classical sets with cardinality greater than one. Definition: A fuzzy set X on domain D is defined by a characteristic function X (x) * <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for all x * D. A fuzzy set generalizes a classical set in that its characteristic function takes values in the interval [0; 1] instead of the set f0; 1g. <p> Definition: A fuzzy set X on domain D is defined by a characteristic function X (x) * <ref> [0; 1] </ref> for all x * D. A fuzzy set generalizes a classical set in that its characteristic function takes values in the interval [0; 1] instead of the set f0; 1g. Fuzzy sets can be used to express subjective or linguistic statements such as "Height is about 180cm." The characteristic function of the fuzzy set, about180cm , is shown in Figure 3 (solid line). <p> It provides a mechanism for "classicalizing" a fuzzy set by converting it to family of classical sets. Definition: The ff-level set or ff-cut of a fuzzy set X, denoted as X ff , is the classical set fx j X (x) ffg for ff * <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The strong ff-cut of a fuzzy set X, denoted as X + ff , is the classical set fx j X (x) &gt; ffg for ff * [0; 1]. <p> a fuzzy set X, denoted as X ff , is the classical set fx j X (x) ffg for ff * <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. The strong ff-cut of a fuzzy set X, denoted as X + ff , is the classical set fx j X (x) &gt; ffg for ff * [0; 1]. <p> Certain fuzzy relational database models [17,24] introduce an additional tuple membership attribute. In this work, however, tuple membership is considered to be a Boolean property because the goal is to analyze database inference at the unit possibility level. The extension of tuple membership to values in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> or, more generally, fuzzy sets on [0; 1], is easily accomplished by treating tuple membership as a separate attribute. <p> In this work, however, tuple membership is considered to be a Boolean property because the goal is to analyze database inference at the unit possibility level.

Reference-contexts: However, in mixed databases, it is possible to have redundant tuples which are equivalent but not identical. These tuples must be subsumed to maintain entity integrity. This is accomplished by "merging" each group of redundant tuples by the set union of the respective components <ref> [4] </ref>. The merge operation defined below reduces to its classical counterpart for precise database relations.

Reference-contexts: In addition to Armstrong's axioms, certain other inference axioms exist for context-based FDs <ref> [9] </ref>. The new axioms relate FDs at different precision levels. The following inference axiom states that if an information chunk x determines some chunk y using an FD, then information more precise than x can determine information less precise than y. <p> The remaining inference axioms formalize partial deduction and abduction, the primary FD-based inference mechanisms. The axioms for partial deduction and abduction use "induced contexts" <ref> [9] </ref> which are similar to induced set functions in set theory. For a relation with attributes X and Y , the induced context, I X!Y (C X ), is the finest context for Y that yields an FD from X to Y with context C X for X. <p> Create a hypernode referencing all nodes with attributes in Y if no such hypernode exists. Add a hyperedge between these two hypernodes. For systematic inference path exploration, the hypergraph can be reduced to a regular graph whose vertices are hyperedges <ref> [9] </ref>. That is, a hyperedge E (a;b) with hypernodes a and b becomes a vertex V E (a;b) in a regular graph. <p> The granularities can be compared using the channel contexts, or better still, by examining the actual inferred information. If one of these channels is considered to be secure, a potential inference compromise exists when the other channel does not produce information which is coarser than the secure channel <ref> [9] </ref>. A potential compromise obviously exists when an inference channel produces finer information than a secure channel.

Reference-contexts: This section discusses the main issues involved in modeling inference paths (intensional analysis) and tracing inference channels (extensional analysis). 5.1 Inference Channels A precise inference channel is defined as a "use set" of FDs <ref> [12] </ref>. Similiarly, an inference channel in a mixed database be defined as a use set of precise, imprecise and/or fuzzy FDs. A use set can be visualized as connected chains of FDs.

Reference-contexts: The imprecise inference formalism described in this paper addresses these issues. The formalism effectively models FD-based imprecise inference, and promotes integration and interoperability in mixed databases. The canonical representation of imprecise inference generalizes precise deduction and the primitive imprecise inference mechanisms of abduction and partial deduction. Core integrity properties <ref> [18] </ref> are specified for "classicalizing" imprecise and fuzzy relations to maximize integration and interoperability with precise database relations. <p> Integration and interoper-abililty are achieved by generalizing the main classical database integrity properties <ref> [18] </ref>. The model is defined using fuzzy sets which generalize classical sets (imprecise values) and singleton sets (precise values). The focus is on imprecise inference or fuzzy inference at the unit membership level (ff-level = 1). Thus, all properties are defined at the unit membership level only.

Reference-contexts: A precise inference attack occurs when a user is able to infer exact values of sensitive information from authorized query responses and prevailing common knowledge. Integrity constraints, particularly functional dependencies (FDs) and multivalued dependencies (MVDs), create "inference channels" used in inference attacks. Su and Oszoyoglu <ref> [21] </ref> showed that the detection and elimination of precise inference channels due to FDs and MVDs in multilevel secure (MLS) databases are NP-complete problems.
