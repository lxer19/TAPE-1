Abstract: The design of file systems is strongly influenced by measuring the use of existing file systems, such file size distribution and patterns of access. We believe that a similar characterization of video stored on the Internet will help network engineers, codec designers, and other multimedia researchers. We therefore executed an experiment to measure how video data is used on the Web today. In this experiment, we downloaded and analyzed over 57000 AVI, QuickTime and MPEG files stored on the Web - approximately 100 Gigabytes of data. Among our more interesting discoveries, we found that the most common video technology in use today is QuickTime, and that the image resolution and frame rate of video files that include audio are much more uniform than video-only files. The majority of all audio/video files have dimensions of CIF or QCIF (or very similar) at 10, 12, 15, or 30 fps, whereas the dimensions and frame rates of video-only files are more uniformly distributed. We also experimentally verified the conjecture that current Internet bandwidth is at least an order of magnitude too slow to support streaming playback of video. We present these results and other statistical information characterizing video on the web in this paper.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In 1985, researchers at the University of California at Berkeley published a study of the UNIX 4.2 BSD file system <ref> [1] </ref>. This analysis provided a number of insights regarding file sizes, lifetimes and access and was highly influential in the design of several file systems. In 1991, Berkeley researchers released a follow-up study on Sprite [2], which verified the assertions made in [1] and made further measurements. <p> study of the UNIX 4.2 BSD file system <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Users adhere to standard small or medium picture dimensions (such as 160x120 or 320x240) when creating videos with audio content, but not when creating videos without audio. 4. The number of movies coming online is increasing exponentially. 5. MPEG <ref> [7] </ref> files compress better than QuickTime [6] or AVI [5] due to their lower bits/pixel values. MPEG files also have smaller playback times and higher frame rates. 6. QuickTime and AVI files share many similar properties. They have analogous distributions for frame rates, duration, size and waiting time.

Reference-contexts: Related Work Surveys dealing with the WWW can be classified into roughly two types: examination of Web traffic and analysis of web content. Web traffic investigation can deal with requests either emanating from a cluster of clients or directly at the server itself. Mogul [14] and Kwan <ref> [11] </ref> have investigated access patterns at specific servers. In addition to analyzing the underlying systems and network behavior of the server under study, they have also examined incoming HTTP requests by looking at their interarrival times, variations with time, size and type of files desired and requesting domain type.

Reference-contexts: The same core criteria (plus some others) have been used by Arlitt [13] to extract underlying patterns from a number of server traces. Cunha et al <ref> [12] </ref> have performed client side traffic work. They instrumented browsers at clusters of workstations to collect individual user access traces, which they then collated and analyzed. In all of these studies, videos accounted for a very small percentage of overall requests.

Reference-contexts: Once again, their analysis is based on data collected during 1995. However, according to Woodruff, MPEGs comprise the highest proportion of video files during this time, followed by QuickTime and AVI respectively. This result agrees with our findings. The study by Smith and Chang <ref> [15] </ref> is, to our knowledge, the only previous work that has analyzed video on the web. They have implemented a system for traversing the web that locates and indexes images and videos. Their focus is on marrying text-based processing and content-based visual analysis to produce an easily searched taxonomy.

Reference-contexts: However, since the traffic data in these studies were all collected during 1994 and 1995 when the web presence of videos, as our study shows, was insignificant, they do not present an accurate picture of current video activity. Woodruff <ref> [16] </ref> and Bray [17] have inspected WWW content. They have looked at a very large number of URLs and HTML documents to characterize document sizes, HTML tag usage, file types used as URLs and so on.
