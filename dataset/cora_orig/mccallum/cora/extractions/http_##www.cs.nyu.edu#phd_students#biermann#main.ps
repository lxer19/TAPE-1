Title: Comic Strips for Algorithm Visualization  
Author: Henning Biermann Richard Cole 
Abstract: This paper presents visualizations of binary search trees and splay trees. The visualizations comprise sequences of figures or frames, called comic strips. Consecutive frames are viewed two at a time to facilitate user (viewer) understanding of the algorithm steps. The visualizations are implemented in Java to facilitate their wide use. This paper explores several other considerations in the design of instructional visualizations.

Reference-contexts: The alternate approach of showing the frames one at a time forces the viewer to remember the exact form of the previous configuration, which seems an unnecessary burden on the viewer. The utility of showing more than one frame at a time was already observed by Naps and Bressler <ref> [NB98] </ref>; they provide an environment for showing multiple frames, which could be successive views of a data structure, or might be alternate views of the same algorithm configuration. Our perspective, which we discuss further in Section 3, is that it is essential to present successive frames within one window.
