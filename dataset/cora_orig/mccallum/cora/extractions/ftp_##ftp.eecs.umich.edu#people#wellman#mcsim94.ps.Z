Abstract: Cognitive mapping is a qualitative decision modeling technique developed over twenty years ago by political scientists, which continues to see occasional use in social science and decision-aiding applications. In this paper, I show how cognitive maps can be viewed in the context of more recent formalisms for qualitative decision modeling, and how the latter provide a firm semantic foundation that can facilitate the development of more powerful inference procedures as well as extensions in expressiveness for models of this sort.

Reference-contexts: Cognitive maps attempt to capture the qualitative structure of a belief system as it relates to a decision problem, by representing the directional relationships among component beliefs. Cognitive maps were introduced by political scientists in the early 1970s as a formal tool for the analysis of policymaking behavior <ref> [1] </ref>. The motivations for focusing on qualitative, or sign, relationships were twofold: 1. The direction of relationships is typically all that is discernible from transcripts of policy sessions or verbal arguments. 2. <p> The social scientists' primary interest is in capturing the structure of a decision problem and determining the relationship among arguments, as opposed to prescribing a policy alternative. In the ensuing years, political scientists generated cognitive maps as part of several historical studies <ref> [1, 2, 4, 16] </ref>. Advocates of the technique claimed that the models faithfully captured the structure of arguments and offered some insights into policy practice. Moreover, the maps were simple to analyze, and although constructing them from raw historical data was labor-intensive, the process was amenable to robust modeling methodology. <p> Then the sign of the derived causal relation from a to b is <ref> [1] </ref>: M 0 O ffi A ; (1) where and denote sign addition and multiplication, respectively. <p> Computing the derived relation via (1) is a form of inference: from the signs of certain links and the absence of others we conclude the derived sign of an arbitrary 5 The situation is more complicated for cognitive maps with cycles. Axelrod <ref> [1] </ref> suggest that one add the signs of all (simple) paths and cycles. But it is not clear which cycles are to be included when querying the relation between two concepts, and also appears questionable whether a negative feedback path should contribute to a negative overall relation.

Cognitive mapping as practiced in political science and organization theory is primarily for descriptive purposes. <p> For example, several of the studies of cognitive maps of policymakers and business managers draw conclusions based on measures of the complexity of the map structure [16, 18] or on its change in structure over time <ref> [3, 18] </ref>. For the most part, these complexity and change measures are simply derived from the size of the graph (nodes and links) or number of common components, and do not make any use of the sign relations or more complex argument structure.

In some descriptions of cognitive maps (e.g., Eden <ref> [10] </ref>), variables are defined in terms of their endpoints, or "poles"; semantically, however, what matters is the relative ordering among values, not whether they are at the extremes. Edges in a QPN denote the sign of probabilistic dependence.

The independence properties of QPNs are identical to those of numeric probabilistic dependency networks <ref> [19] </ref>, so all results and algorithms based on graph structure alone carry over.

Reference-contexts: Presumably, the map endorses an option if it can be shown to qualitatively increase the utility of all the groups of interest. The power to prescribe decisions can also be justified by an appeal to qualitative probabilistic networks. In QPNs (as in influence diagrams <ref> [20] </ref>), we distinguish decision variables under the agent's direct control, and designate one variable as the value node denoting the objective. Edges into the value node describe the qualitative functional relation of the antecedent concept on utility.
