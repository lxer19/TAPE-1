Abstract: A novel scene reconstruction technique is presented, different from previous approaches in its ability to cope with large changes in visibility and its modeling of intrinsic scene color and texture information. The method avoids image correspondence problems by working in a discretized scene space whose voxels are traversed in a fixed visibility ordering. This strategy takes full account of occlusions and allows the input cameras to be far apart and widely distributed about the environment. The algorithm identifies a special set of invariant voxels which together form a spatial and photometric reconstruction of the scene, fully consistent with the input images.

Reference-contexts: First, the reconstruction must be dense and sufficiently accurate to reproduce the original images. This requirement poses a problem for feature-based reconstruction methods, which produce relatively sparse reconstructions. Although sparse reconstructions can be augmented by fitting surfaces (e.g., <ref> [ Beardsley et al., 1996 ] </ref> ), the triangulation techniques currently used cannot easily cope with discontinuities and, more importantly, are not image driven. Consequently, surfaces derived from sparse reconstructions may only agree with the input images at points where image features were detected.

Reference-contexts: The voxel coloring algorithm presented here works by discretizing scene space into a set of voxels that are traversed and colored in a special order. In this respect, the method is similar to Collins' Space-Sweep approach <ref> [ Collins, 1996 ] </ref> , which performs an analogous scene traversal. However, the Space-Sweep algorithm does not provide a solution to the occlusion problem, a primary contribution of this paper.

Reference-contexts: While some stereo methods can cope with limited occlusions, visibility changes of much greater magnitude appear to be beyond the state of the art. In addition, the views may be far apart, making the correspondence problem extremely difficult. Existing stereo-based approaches to this prob lem <ref> [ Kanade et al., 1995 ] </ref> match nearby images two or three at a time to ameliorate visibility problems. This approach, however, does not fully integrate the image information and introduces new complications, such as how to merge the partial reconstructions.

Reference-contexts: An image-space visibility ordering was described by McMillan and Bishop [ McMil-lan and Bishop, 1995 ] , but was used only for image rendering, not correspondence computation or scene reconstruction. Also related are recently developed panoramic stereo <ref> [ McMillan and Bishop, 1995, Kang and Szeliski, 1996 ] </ref> algorithms that avoid field of view problems by matching 360 degree panoramic views directly. Panoramic reconstructions can also be achieved using our approach, but without the need to first build panoramic images (see Figures 1 (b) and 4).

However, the Space-Sweep algorithm does not provide a solution to the occlusion problem, a primary contribution of this paper. Katayama et al. <ref> [ Katayama et al., 1995 ] </ref> described a related method in which images are matched by detecting lines through slices of an epipolar volume, noting that occlusions could be explained by labeling lines in order of increasing slope.

Reference-contexts: Given a multiplicity of solutions to the reconstruction problem, the only way to recover intrinsic scene information is through invariants| properties that are satisfied by every consistent scene. For instance, consider the set of voxels that are present in every consistent scene. Laurentini <ref> [ Laurentini, 1995 ] </ref> described how these invariants, called hard points, could be recovered by volume intersection from binary images. Hard points are useful in that they provide absolute information about the true scene.

Reference-contexts: A purely contour-based reconstruction can be texture-mapped, as in <ref> [ Moezzi et al., 1996 ] </ref> , but not in a way that ensures projected consistency with all of the input images, due to the aforementioned problems. In addition, contour-based methods require occluding contours to be isolated; a difficult segmentation problem avoided by voxel coloring.
