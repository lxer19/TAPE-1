Abstract: The RF-SLISSOM model integrates two separate lines of research on computational modeling of the visual cortex. Laterally connected self-organizing maps have been used to model how afferent structures such as orientation columns and patterned lateral connections can simultaneously self-organize through input-driven Hebbian adaptation. Spiking neurons with leaky integrator synapses have been used to model image segmentation and binding by synchronization and desynchronization of neuronal group activity. Although these approaches differ in how they model the neuron and what they explain, they share the same overall layout of a laterally connected two-dimensional network. This paper shows how both self-organization and segmentation can be achieved in such an integrated network, thus presenting a unified model of development and functional dynamics in the primary visual cortex.

Reference-contexts: The afferent receptive fields were 7 fi 7 squares, comparable in size to the major axis of the Gaussian. The receptive field of neuron (i; j) was centered at (i=3; j=3), and the afferent weights were randomly initialized within <ref> [0:25; 1] </ref> in the 3 fi 3 center and [0; 0:75] in the perimeter of the receptive field and then normalized as in equation 3 (figure 2a). The lateral connection weights were randomly initialized within [0; 1] and normalized (equation 3; figure 2c). <p> The lateral connection weights were randomly initialized within <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and normalized (equation 3; figure 2c). Each neuron received inhibition from a square 31 fi 31 neighborhood, and excitation from a neighborhood initially of size 17 fi 17, gradually decreasing to 7 fi 7 in 2,500 input presentations. <p> The self-organized lateral connections represent correlations in the input. Because they are mostly inhibitory, redundant activity is reduced, and the number of active neurons for each input minimized. Such coding is thought to be well suited for the detection of suspicious coincidences, associative memory, and feature grouping <ref> [1, 2, 11, 12] </ref>. The RF-SLISSOM model introduces temporal dynamics to sparse coding. Leaky integrator neurons with dynamic thresholds desynchronize representations of different objects, forming a temporal sparse coding as 14 well.

[28] who multiplied the weighted sums from afferent connections and those from lateral connections. Multiplying exerts better modulation on the neuronal activity, but disturbs self-organization by rapid fluctuation.

Reference-contexts: In the standard RF-LISSOM model, the input is kept constant while the cortical response settles through the lateral connections, forming a concentrated, redundancy-reduced activation pattern (as measured by the kurtosis of the map activity <ref> [11, 29] </ref>). The RF-SLISSOM goes through a similar settling process. The retinal neurons are spiking constantly at each iteration and the cortical neurons are allowed to exchange spikes. <p> The self-organized lateral connections represent correlations in the input. Because they are mostly inhibitory, redundant activity is reduced, and the number of active neurons for each input minimized.

Reference-contexts: During self-organization, the connections between uncorrelated regions became weaker, and in the end, the strong connections link areas of similar orientation preferences (figure 4b). Furthermore, the connection patterns are elongated along the direction that corresponds to the neuron's preferred stimulus orientation, as they do in the cortex <ref> [13] </ref>.

Apparently when they overlap slightly, phase locking becomes less well defined at the border of the areas.

Larger magnification factor allows a larger number of cortical neurons to represent the features of the input at each location, resulting in a better mapping of the input space. <p> Thus, a more accurate representation of gradually changing orientation preference requires a simulation with a larger magnification factor. Similarly, representing other features such as ocular dominance and spatial frequency <ref> [22] </ref> is possible but increases the computational requirements even further. Such simulations should be possible with the newest generation of parallel supercomputers, and constitute the most immediate direction of future work. The extent of lateral connections is a crucial factor in binding and segmentation.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Several models of the visual cortex that take into account lateral interactions between neurons have recently been proposed (see Sirosh et al. <ref> [34] </ref> for an overview). These models can potentially account for a wider set of developmental and functional phenomena than Self-Organizing Map (SOM) models without explicit lateral connections [23, 24, 25, 26].

There are two possible solutions to this problem. One way is to have two sets of lateral connections, one for fast adaptation and the other for slow adaptation <ref> [38] </ref>. The fast connections become active after the slow connections have converged. The other is to vary the learning rate of the synapse. The learning process starts out with a slow learning rate and gradually the synapses become more plastic.
