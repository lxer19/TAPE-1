Abstract: We lay the foundation for ontological mediation as a method for resolving communication difficulties resulting from different ontologies. The notion of hierarchical relations enables a theory of orientation or direction of ontologies to be presented. We describe an ontologcial mediator as being able to think about (or conceptualize) concepts from ontologies and find equivalences between them. Algorithms for finding the meanings of unfamiliar words by asking questions are introduced and evaluated experimentally.

Reference-contexts: Worse yet, they often cannot agree on a taxonomization of the domain into represented concepts. For example, notice the differences between upper levels of the CYC (Lenat & Guha 1990; Lenat 1995), and Penman <ref> (Bateman et al. 1990) </ref> ontologies shown in figure 1. Moreover, useful knowledge resources designed before a standard ontology is adopted will not be able to participate in information interchange without the assistance of some sort of translator or mediator to facilitate dialogue with other agents.

Reference-contexts: Both agents use the WordNet ontology, but are restricted from using words strictly from the other's dialect (they pretend not to know them). The dialect restrictions come from the Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language, <ref> (Crystal 1995, p. 309) </ref>. Naturally we only used word pairs where both words exist in WordNet in the same synset. We chose 57 word pairs where both words were present in WordNet and members of the same snyset, for example, (lift,elevator), (patience, solitaire), (holiday, vacation), (draughts, checkers).

Reference-contexts: Presently, this involves deciding ahead of time on the following: I. a syntax and semantics for the language in which they communicate (a popular one is KIF <ref> (Genesereth 1995) </ref>), and II. an ontology, or domain conceptualization that sets forth the terminology they may use, along with relations that hold between the concepts that these terms denote.

Reference-contexts: Work on pruning this sort of search is being considered. Meanwhile we plan to apply ontological mediation algorithms to other ontologies including the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) <ref> (Humphreys & Lindberg 1993) </ref>. Mediating between two different ontologies, UMLS and WordNet will lead to new ideas for ontological mediation algorithms. Another experiment could involve human subjects, for example, those searching a database and are looking for just the right keyword to find some target.

Reference-contexts: Of course, this assumption can lead to problems when common words really don't mean the same thing. Then it becomes the agents' duty to detect miscommunication. Work is being done in this area (see, for example <ref> (McRoy 1996) </ref>) but this is not the focus of our current research. We are more concerned with using mediation techniques to find correspondences between concepts in ontologies. This presupposes detection, since the agents have called a mediator to help them.
