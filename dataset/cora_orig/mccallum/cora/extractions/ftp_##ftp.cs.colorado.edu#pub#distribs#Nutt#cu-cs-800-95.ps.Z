Reference-contexts: a new set of issues arise, e.g., suppose an interaction in the snippet replay changes the state of an object 19 so that it is inconsistent with the snippet; should this be allowed? How can it be correlated with the remainder of the snippet (cf. shared memory multiprocessor trace extrapolation <ref> [7] </ref>. Global Replay. Should global replay create a new, nested world within a particular world? 8 Status and Conclusion The VPR is an experimental software system to implement multi user virtual environments.

Reference-contexts: Such machines are almost universally configured with UNIX operating systems. The UNIX operating system was designed as a timesharing system, thus its strategy for scheduling, blocking processes, data throughput, etc. is not particularly well-suited for VE middleware and applications. Jeffay <ref> [19] </ref> and others have posed alternative operating system strategies tuned to support multimedia-based domains. Independently, there is a trend in operating systems design to factor conventional operating systems services into a minimum nucleus of functions called a micro-kernel with full services being provided by servers that use the microkernel. <p> Nakajima and Tezuka describe work being conducted at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology with researchers at Carnegie-Mellon University on 5 the use of RT-Mach to support multimedia applications [21].

Reference-contexts: However, there is a diversity of opinion about how computers might best assist a group in its work, ranging from "situated work" [26], to automatic coordination systems <ref> [20] </ref>. There is an emerging camp that takes an intermediate position: the computer might be used to assist in computation and the coordination or work, though the team should not rely on the machine to do all the computation nor all the coordination for the work.

Reference-contexts: In another paper, we argue that model-based virtual environments (MBVEs) are especially well-suited to CSCW work because they provide a framework in which the group can capture the structured parts of their work, yet still have a high bandwidth mechanism for formal and informal communication <ref> [24] </ref>. Like conventional electronic meeting rooms and virtual environments, MBVEs are compute- and I/O-intensive distributed systems; besides their inherent functionality requirements, reasonable system performance is a prerequisite to their success.
