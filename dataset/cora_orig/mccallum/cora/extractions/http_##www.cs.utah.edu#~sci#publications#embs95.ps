Abstract: An anatomically accurate 3-D cellular automaton model was used for studying electrical propagation in canine ventricles. The heart model geometry was based upon histologically extracted information that takes into account anisotropy of propagation through myocardial fiber orientation. We present results that compare our computer model to experimentally obtained activation sequences from a canine heart. The data generated from the model showed a high correlation, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to experimental results and that the inclusion of the anisotropy of propagation plays an important role when modeling electrical wave propagation. We envision our model as a useful tool in the search for parameters that promote, initiate and sustain ventricular arrhythmia and fibrillation in the heart. Once characterized, these parameters could contribute to determining the arrhythmogenic risk of patients with heart disease.

These models are known as cellular automaton models <ref> [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] </ref>. Using currently available computational means, the wave equation methods and the cellular automata are the only feasible means of simulating propagation in the entire heart. <p> Cellular automata are simplistic models of the complex processes, and hence a validation of the results from cellular automation models is imperative. Earlier models, like the model described by Moe et al. <ref> [21] </ref>, lacked spatial or temporal information about the model and the parameters that were used. In our model, the spatial and temporal information is inherent as part of the design and hence it is possible to compare our results with experimental studies. <p> The basic rules for our model are an extension of the 2-D cellular automaton model first described by Moe et al. <ref> [21] </ref> and extensively used by Abildskov [31, 32, 33]. A simulated action potential, which is equivalent to the state diagram, for the model is shown in Figure 2. The first state we encounter is labeled 5 fl , and is the resting state. <p> An element in this state can be excited by an external stimulus or by an activated neighbor. On a subsequent fl The numbering of the states is arbitrary, and is defined as in the model described by Moe et al. <ref> [21] </ref> 4 5 time step, the element changes from state 5 to state 1, the first activation, or absolute refractory state, in which no subsequent activation is possible. As a continuation of this activation process, each activated element propagates the activation to all 26 of its nearest neighbors. <p> In this state the element may not be activated either by an external stimulus or by an activated neighbor. The duration of the absolute refractory state, the absolutely refractory period (ARP), is not constant but is proportional to the square root of the previous cycle length (CL) <ref> [21] </ref> according to. ARP = K fi CL (1) The constant of proportionality K, determines the recovery properties of the element. Elements with smaller K values recover faster than elements with a larger K value.

Reference-contexts: Individual parameter setting also allows model parameters to be set on the basis of tissue type assignments. This permits us to mimic the experimental finding that epicardial tissue recovers faster than endocardial <ref> [34] </ref> by adjusting the mean value of K in both regions To model cardiac electrical activity, the model must mimic propagation in the heart, which moves from cell to cell via low resistance gap junctions in the intercalated disks at cell interfaces.

Reference-contexts: Activation isochrones may be extracted for the entire dataset or only from certain selected regions and then utilized for visual or statistical correlation with experimental data. Isochrones can be visualized using Map3D <ref> [37] </ref>, or other visualization systems like AVS, SGI Iris Explorer or IBM Data Explorer that provide automatic isosurface extraction. Electrograms may be calculated from the dataset by assigning electrical potential values to the individual states. We used a finite difference method to compute the potential dipoles for every element.

Reference-contexts: In the experiment, the sock was placed on the epicardial surface of a dog heart that had been surgically exposed and suspended in a pericardial cradle, under pentobarbital anesthesia (30 mg/Kg). A similar protocol has been followed in other experiments described by Taccardi <ref> [39, 40] </ref>. Unipolar electrographic signals from 242 sock electrodes were simultaneously amplified, sampled at 1 KHz per channel, digitized (12 bits) and stored in a MicroVax II disk memory. The heart was sequentially paced from 45 sites selected out of the 242 electrodes the pacing sites covering the entire epicardium.
