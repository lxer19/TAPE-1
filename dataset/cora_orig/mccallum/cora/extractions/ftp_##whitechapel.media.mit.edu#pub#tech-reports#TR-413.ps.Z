Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 413 Appears in the Royal Society Workshop on Knowledge-based Vision in Man and Machine, London, England | February, 1997 To appear: Proceedings of the Royal Socoiety Abstract We present several approaches to the machine perception of motion and discuss the role and levels of knowledge in each. In particular we describe different techniques of motion understanding as focusing on one of movement, activity, or action. Movements are the most atomic primitives, requiring no contextual or sequence knowledge to be recognized; movement is often addressed using either view- invariant or view specific geometric techniques. Activity refers to sequences of movements or states, where the only real knowledge required is the statistics of the sequence; much of the recent work in gesture understanding falls within this category of motion perception. Finally, actions are larger scale events which typically include interaction with the environment and causal relationships; action understanding straddles the gray division between perception and cognition, computer vision and artificial intelligence. We illustrate these levels with examples drawn mostly from our work in understanding motion in video imagery and argue the utility of such a division is that it makes explicit the representational competencies and manipulations necessary for perception.
