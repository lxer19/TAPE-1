Title: Domain-specific Information Browsers for Man Page, File, and Font  
Author: Thomas A. Phelps 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Computer Science Division University of California,  
Abstract: The task of information browsers is (1) to aid in navigating through a large database to locate the item of interest and (2) to inspect or otherwise manipulate this item once found. This document describes three experi-ments in constructing tools for information browsing: TkMan for UNIX manual pages, NBT for files in a hierarchical file system, and FoSel for bitmap fonts. Each exploits the large-scale natural organization of data and the fine-grained structure of each datum with a graphical user interface to provide a powerful yet intuitive tool. The lessons learned in imple-menting the browsers point to general principles that should guide the design of all information browsers.

Reference-contexts: One can imagine a more uid interface yet. The widgets provided by Tk and most user interface toolkits come in rectangles of varying sizes that are pasted together in nonoverlapping regions. Given a more powerful rendering mechanism such as Display PostScript <ref> [Ado93] </ref>, one could compose an interface of greater aesthetic harmony and take fuller advantage of graphic design with greater freedom in widget shape and relative placement. Some of this is possible with Tks canvas drawing widget, which can draw arbitrary shapes and associate widget-like behaviors with them.

Furthermore, Robertson et al at Xerox PARC [RCM93] exploit 3-D rendering and animation in the creation of novel information browsers. The other aspect of the visible interface is its dynamic reconfiguration to different docu-ment types.

Reference-contexts: Of the two, XHyper is the more advanced, leveraging code from InterViews idraw graphics editor and doc word processor. In addition, one enjoys the convenience and sophistication of FrameMaker in writing his help documents, as FrameMakers Maker Markup Language is XHypers storage format. HyperHelp <ref> [Bri] </ref>, a commercial product, represents the top of the line of this new class of help systems. It sports hierarchical document navigation with hypertext, backtracking and book-marks. Help pages are rendered in multiple colors and illustrated with embedded pictures. One may attach PostIt-like notes to arbitrary help pages.

Reference-contexts: Neither provides any special support for manual pages over that given to any ordinary ASCII document. Perl man is the result of a complete rewrite of the man system with the three goals of effect [ing] substantial gains in functionality, extensibility, and speed <ref> [Chr87] </ref>. It combs through man pages cross checking for misnamed, misorganized and missing man pages. The results of all this labor are stored in a database to provide very rapid location of content location, bypassing a search through the file system.

Indeed, the interrelationships of functionality dictate the organization, which in turn points back to the function. Form follows function. Form illuminates function.

Reference-contexts: It describes a structured, hierarchical format homologous to the essentials of LaTeXs format, with hypertext links between structural entities. Info viewers can build more advanced features on top of this infrastructure, but it remains a text-based format at heart. 4 XHyper [Hem93] and X.Desktop <ref> [Dav93] </ref> surpass TeXinfo viewers with multiple fonts and embedded pictures. Navigation in the hypertext web is enhanced by backtracking and book-mark setting. Of the two, XHyper is the more advanced, leveraging code from InterViews idraw graphics editor and doc word processor.

Reference-contexts: The most highly developed output form is that for Ensemble <ref> [GHM92] </ref>. With its companion structure and presentation schemas, the appearance of a man page in Ensem-ble can be radically transformed. <p> A component of the Ensemble Multimedia Editor of structured documents <ref> [GHM92] </ref>, NBT addresses these concerns by bringing together various means of navigation, providing an extensible means of viewing and manipulating files, and learning from user interaction to custom-ize itself. NBT is useful for navigating and inspecting files apart from or in conjunction with selecting them for use in an application.

Reference-contexts: A number of output formats have been implemented besides those for TkMan and [tn]roff. The ASCII format produces pure ASCII shorn of boldfacing and italics for use by indexing programs. With all of the structural signals that output functions receive, it is trivial to write SGML <ref> [Gol90] </ref> and HTML (which is simply SGML with a specific document type defini-tion) output formats simply by emitting an appropriate start tag or end tag when called with the corresponding signal. The most highly developed output form is that for Ensemble [GHM92].

Reference-contexts: This section argues for the need of file browsers, for use in conjunction with and apart from an application. NBT extends the design of NEXTSTEPs file selection box <ref> [NeX92] </ref> and sets a new standard for file browsers in the areas of directory navigation and file inspection and manipula-tion. NBT is the second experiment in domain-specific information browsers. <p> Yet even today, many X Windows and even Suns OpenWindows applications merely present a line to the user on which he is expected to type the full, often lengthy path name of the desired file <ref> [NeX92] </ref>. Motif [Ope91] and some X and Tcl/Tk programmers have improved on this by offering a point-and-click (no typing) mechanism. <p> Another X file selection box [vdP89] gives a contextual view of three directories and, with a scrollbar, one can scroll up the entire directory path. Although not well publicized, it is a high quality, freely usuable widget. NEXTSTEP <ref> [NeX92] </ref> improves upon this contextual view with an iconic representation of files and a shelf upon which one can cache directories and files for quick access later. 3.2 Design 3.2.1 Navigation of Directory Hierarchy NBT consolidates and extends the best features of file selection boxes from the Macintoshs and NEXTSTEPs, which

Reference-contexts: Alas, removed from the text-based UNIX pipe world, xman lacks copy and paste and searching within the man page. One must scroll page by page, reading the screen for the relevant passage, and then retype it into its destination. Just as Perl man improved upon the earlier man, hman <ref> [Rao91] </ref> improves upon xman. The manual page of hman claims that it displays a manual page and highlight [s] the references to other UNIX commands. Clicking on the highlighted text will display the new manual page. The Search button searches a regular expression in the text.

Reference-contexts: Perl man indexes long man pages to provide direct access to sec-tions and subsections. To take advantage of the feature, though, one must first memorize or instruct Perl man to produce a list of available sections, then invoke it again with a few-letter key to identify the section. Emacs <ref> [Sta87] </ref> can bring man pages into its editing environment, where there the user can take advantage of its wealth of capabilities. The user can search for text incrementally or with reg 3 ular expressions, copy and paste text into another file or to a shell window within Emacs. <p> Regular expression searching scans the entire document for matches, highlights them, and then lets the user navigate from one to the next. Switches under the Occasionals menu toggle the cases sensitivity of the search mechanisms. Finally, Emacs-like <ref> [Sta87] </ref> bindings control screen scrolling from the keyboard. One may scroll by lines or pages, jump directly to the head or tail of the document, or set a mark and return to that position later. 2.4.4 Customization TkMan may be customized on three levels of increasing difficulty. <p> Upon selecting a file, users may Peek at it or View it. Peeking shows the raw ASCII contents of a file, along with file meta information, e.g., creation time and file size. As in Emacs <ref> [Sta87] </ref>, one may search the contents incrementally, character by character, either forward or backward. Regular expression searching is available in a text entry line at the bottom of the window.

Reference-contexts: It boasts a text search facility and a popup glossary and can print out any help page.
