Abstract: Clinical decision analysis seeks to identify the optimal management strategy by modelling the uncertainty and risks entailed in the diagnosis, natural history, and treatment of a particular problem or disorder. Decision trees are the most frequently used model in clinical decision analysis, but can be tedious to construct, cumbersome to use, and computationally prohibitive, especially with large, complex decision problems. We present a new method for clinical decision analysis that combines the techniques of decision theory and artificial intelligence. Our model uses a modular representation of knowledge that simplifies model building and enables more fully automated decision making. Moreover, the model exploits problem structures to yield better computational efficiency. As an example we apply our techniques to the problem of management of acute deep venous thrombosis.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Clinical decision analysis, an analytic approach to decision making based on decision theory, is increasingly used to seek optimal decisions (or "strategies") for clinical protocols as well as management of individual patients <ref> [1] </ref>. Typically, a decision analyst will construct a set of decision trees to evaluate potential management strategies. There are two disadvantages to decision trees. First, even with the help of currently available software packages, constructing and evaluating decision trees remains tedious, and requires meticulous attention to avoid introducing errors.

Reference-contexts: The area of artificial intelligence known as decision-theoretic planning has yielded new, alternative approaches for decision-making models. We introduce the abstraction-based model <ref> [2] </ref>, which addresses the problems identified earlier in the decision tree model. We applied this abstraction-based model to a clinical problem to demonstrate the model's practical advantages over the decision trees. We refer to the full paper [3] for more detailed description of the model, and discussion of additional issues.

Reference-contexts: ACUTE DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS Appropriate management of patients with suspected acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities remains an important and complex clinical problem. The clinical findings of DVT do not permit diagnosis with certainty <ref> [4] </ref>. Unchecked, DVT of the calf veins (calf-DVT) can progress to the deep veins of the thigh (thigh-DVT), which can cause pulmonary embolism (PE), a condition that entails significant morbidity and mortality. Anticoagulation therapy for DVT is expensive and carries the risk of hemorrhage.

Reference-contexts: Anticoagulation therapy for DVT is expensive and carries the risk of hemorrhage. Even diagnostic procedures such as venog-raphy entail risks such as iatrogenic thrombosis or contrast reaction. We constructed a model for diagnosis and treatment of DVT based on data from an article that compared 24 different management strategies <ref> [5] </ref>. The available diagnostic tests are venography (Venography), impedance plethysmography (IPG), and real-time ultrasonography (RUS). <p> Memory consumption values represent the maximum memory size that is required at one time by each algorithm. model" assumptions of the original model <ref> [5] </ref>, in which the cost of a fatal event was set at $30,000, drips determined that the plan with the highest expected utility was their Strategy A, "No Tests, No Treatment." The cost of this plan differed from the cost identified in the reference manuscript.

Reference-contexts: In fact, for several other plans, drips calculated cost values that differed from those published in the source manuscript. In attempting to resolve this discrepancy, we discovered that at least one of the 24 decision trees constructed by Hillner and colleagues was incorrect <ref> [7] </ref>. Evaluating this model on our DEC 5000/200 machine with unoptimized code written in Common Lisp took less than eight minutes.

Reference-contexts: Although creating the composite actions and the abstraction hierarchy is easy, calculating the descriptions for abstract actions based on the composite actions proved to be a tedious job. We are working on automating this calculation process <ref> [8] </ref>. We are also investigating how to automatically specify the optimal abstraction hierarchy. Our approach works with any abstraction hierarchy, but some are better than the others since they provide better pruning.
