Abstract: Combinatorial auctions, i.e. auctions where bidders can bid on combinations of items, tend to lead to more efficient allocations than traditional auctions in multi-item auctions where the agents' valuations of the items are not additive. However, determining the winners so as to maximize revenue is N P-complete. First, existing approaches for tackling this problem are reviewed: exhaustive enumeration, dynamic programming, approximation algorithms, and restricting the allowable combinations. Then we overview our new search algorithm for optimal anytime winner determination. By capitalizing on the fact that the space of bids is necessarily sparsely populated in practice, it enlarges the envelope of input sizes for which combinatorial auctions are computationally feasible. Finally we discuss eMediator, our electronic commerce server which implements several techniques for automatically facilitating commerce, including an auction house with generalized combinatorial auctions. To our knowledge, our implementation is the first Internet auction to support combinatorial auctions, bidding via graphically drawn price-quantity graphs, and by mobile agents.

Reference-contexts: To allow an efficient allocation to be reached, it would be desirable to extract truthful valuation revelations as the bids to the auctioneer. Bidding truthfully can be made incentive compatible (a dominant strategy) by using the Groves-Clarke mechanism <ref> [ 5, 4 ] </ref> . This means that each bidder is motivated to bid truthfully irrespective of what the others bid. This renders counterspec-ulation unnecessary.

Reference-contexts: A considerable amount of research has focused on generating such approximation algorithms that execute in polynomial time. In the case of combinatorial auctions this means time that is polynomial in n. 6.1 General case Unfortunately, a recent inapproximability result of Hastad for the maximum clique problem <ref> [ 8 ] </ref> can be used to show that no polynomial time algorithm can guarantee a bound k n 1* for any * &gt; 0 for the winner determination problem (unless N P equals probabilistic polynomial time).

Reference-contexts: The winner determination problem is the same problem as the abstract prob 7 lem called weighted set packing once we view each bid as a set and the price, b (S), as the weight of the set S. The fact that weighted set packing is N P-complete <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> means that, unless P = N P, no algorithm can find a revenue maximizing allocation in combinatorial auctions in polynomial time in n.

Reference-contexts: When testing the anytime feature, it turned out that in practice most of the revenue was generated early on as desired, and there were diminishing returns to computation. The same search tree can be searched more efficiently without compromising optimality by using an iterative deepening A* search strategy <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> (with a heuristic that we developed specifically for the winner determination applica 12 tion) instead of depth-first search. Furthermore, before the main search we run a preprocessing search that removes all the bids that are provably noncompetitive. This makes the main search faster without compromising optimality.

Reference-contexts: Because every bidder would want to wait, no bidding would commence. As a patch to this problem, activity rules have been used <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> . Each bidder has to bid at least a certain volume by predefined time points in the auction, otherwise the bidder's future rights are reduced in some prespecified manner. Unfortunately, the equilibrium bidding strategies in such auctions are not game-theoretically known. <p> Another approach is to allow bidders to retract their bids if they do not get the combinations that they want. For example, in the Federal Communications Committee's bandwidth auction the bidders were allowed to retract their bids. In case of a retraction, the item was opened for reauction <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> . If the new winning price was lower than the old one, the bidder that retracted the bid had to pay the difference. This guarantees that retractions do not decrease the auctioneer's payoff. However, it exposes the retracting bidder to considerable risk.

One idea toward this direction was presented early on by Rassenti et al <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> . They allowed the bidder to place combinational bids and to state the maximal number of combinations that could be accepted. An XOR-bid is a special case of this where that number is one. In our auction server, we allow the user to submit multiple XOR-bids.

Reference-contexts: We will also restrict our attention to settings where there is only one indivisible unit of each item. While these restrictions are common in the literature on combinatorial auctions <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> , winner determination methods have also been developed for cases where these assumptions are relaxed [ 14 ] . Such more general auctions are discussed in section 9. <p> The next sections discuss different approaches for tackling the winner determination problem. 5 Dynamic programming One approach to optimal winner determination is to use dynamic programming instead of exhaustive enumeration in the graph of Figure 1. This has been discussed by Rothkopf et al <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> . Based on the b (S) function, the dynamic programming algorithm determines for each set S of items the highest possible revenue that can be acquired using only the items in S. The algorithm proceeds systematically from the smallest sets to the largest. <p> The savings compared to exhaustive search come from the fact that the revenue maximizing solutions for the subsets need not be computed over and over again, but only once. The dynamic programming algorithm takes (2 m ) and o (2 2m ) steps <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> , which is a considerable saving over exhaustive enumeration, but still too complex to scale to large numbers of items (above about 20-30). A key observation here is that the dynamic programming algorithm takes the same number of steps independent of the number of actual bids. <p> To capitalize on this idea in practice, the restrictions would have to be imposed by the auctioneer since they (at least the currently known ones <ref> [ 16 ] </ref> ) are so severe that it is very unlikely that they would hold by chance. Imposing restrictions on the bids introduces some of the same inefficiencies that are present in non-combinatorial auctions because the bidders may be barred from bidding on the combinations that they want.

The number of such allocations is so large that not all allocations can be enumerated unless the number of items is extremely small|below a dozen or so in practice.
