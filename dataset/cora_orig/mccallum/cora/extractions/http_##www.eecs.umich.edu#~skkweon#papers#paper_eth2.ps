Abstract: In order to realize real-time communication over Ethernet or fast Ethernet, one must be able to bound the medium access time within an acceptable limit. The multiple access nature of an Ethernet makes it impossible to guarantee a deterministic medium access time (hence packet delivery deadlines) to individual stations. However, one can bound the medium access time statistically by limiting the packet arrival rate at the medium access control (MAC) layer. While focusing on automated manufacturing systems as the main application, this paper considers the connection admission control (CAC) problem for statistically bounding the medium access time of Ethernet. Specifically, a packet is guaranteed to have a medium access time smaller than a predefined bound with a certain probability if the instantaneous packet arrival rate is kept below a certain threshold. Through an analysis, we first derived such a threshold. In order to keep the packet arrival rate under the given threshold, we employ a middleware which (i) resides between the transport layer and Ethernet datalink layer and (ii) smooths packet streams between them. The implementation of this middleware requires only a minimal change in the OS kernel without any modification to the current standard of Ethernet MAC protocol or TCP or UDP/IP stack. In order to solve the CAC problem, we derived the probability of transmitting a packet successfully upon each trial by modeling the MAC protocol, 1-persistent CSMA/CD, and the collision resolution protocol, Binary Exponential Backoff, of Ethernet. Using a simulation study, we have shown this analytic model to provide a reasonably accurate estimate of packet-loss (or deadline-miss) rate over Fast Ethernet. Finally, we implemented the middleware on the Linux OS, experimentally demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in providing real-time communication over Ethernet.

Reference-contexts: Before describing our model, let's examine the operation of BEB briefly. When a packet collides with another packet, BEB sets the backoff time for the packet indicating when to try its retransmission. The backoff time is randomly chosen from <ref> [0; 1; ; 2 n1 ] </ref>fi slot time, where n is the number of times the packet has collided with other packets and slot time is 512 bit times (in Ethernet, 51.2 secs, and in Fast Ethernet, 5.12 secs).

Reference-contexts: Most of earlier work in the area of supporting real-time communication over Ethernet focused on modifying the Ethernet MAC sub-layer so that a bounded channel access time may be achieved [2-4]. These approaches are quite costly compared to using the well-established and widely-used current Ethernet standard. Venkatramani and Chiueh <ref> [5] </ref> proposed implementation of a virtual token ring over Ethernet in order to avoid packet collision. Token management is executed by a higher-layer protocol rather than the MAC, and thus their approach does not require modifying the hardware but the software.

Reference-contexts: However, the throughput and average delay analysis is not enough nor acceptable in realizing real-time communication. Realization of real-time communication requires the knowledge of the tail distribution of packet delay rather than such average performance parameters. Beuerman and Coyle <ref> [6] </ref> derived the tail distribution of packet delay in a non-persistent CSMA/CD protocol, assuming that the average waiting time for retransmission is sufficiently larger than packet transmission time. However, the characteristic of the 1-persistent CSMA/CD protocol combined with BEB is quite different from their result on the non-persistent version.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, a statistical real-time channel is defined as a unidirectional virtual circuit that guarantees the timely delivery of packets in statistical terms, i.e., the probability that a packet is lost during its transmission or misses its delivery deadline is less than a certain loss tolerance, Z <ref> [7] </ref>: P r (end-to-end packet loss) Z; (2.1) or P r (packet delay &gt; delay bound) Z: (2.2) Unlike WAN or other LANs such as FDDI and FieldBus, Ethernet cannot control the medium access time of individual stations or connections.

Reference-contexts: In an Ethernet where the arrival rate of new packets is quite low, if no collision occurs for a sufficiently long time, the channel offered traffic rate is 1 this modeling draws on Vo-Dai's work <ref> [8] </ref> which we modified to accommodate the bursty nature of Ethernet traffic 7 very small and close to the arrival rate of new packets. However, once a collision occurs, the channel offered traffic rate increases abruptly due to the small backoff time. <p> In state 3 of Figure 2, t 3 + Y indicates the latest transmission initiated within the contention period. See <ref> [8] </ref> for a detailed account of derivation of G (x). Note that G (x) depends on the packet arrival rate in both contention states 2 and 6. <p> Note that g is the rate of both new packet arrivals and retransmission trials in QUIET mode. Since we have two channel offered traffic rates, g and fi in our model, Figure 3 must read differently from the results in <ref> [8, 10] </ref>. Figure 3 indicates the relation between g and the input load from outside the system. We determine g from Figure 3, given the input load, using the steady-state condition assumption as discussed in Section 3.2. Unlike g, fi is a fixed parameter that is independent of the throughput.

Reference-contexts: Then, it is easy to show G (x; g) G (x; fi); 8 x: That is, Y (fi) is probabilistically larger than Y (g) <ref> [9] </ref>, where Y (g) and Y (fi) are the latest transmissions initiated in states 2 and 6 in reference to their starting times, respectively. Then, G (x) is given as the weighted sum of G (x; g) and G (x; fi).

Reference-contexts: The collision domain diameter is 10 m. Our middleware is installed on all of the PCs, and smooths the packet stream using a leaky-bucket regulator <ref> [11] </ref> which has a token bucket. The token bucket depth (TBD) limits the maximum number of tokens that can be contained in the token bucket. Up to TBD tokens are added to the bucket every refresh period (RP), specified in seconds.
