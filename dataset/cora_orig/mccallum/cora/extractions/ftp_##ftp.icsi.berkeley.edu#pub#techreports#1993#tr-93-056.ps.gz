Abstract: Many new applications in networks require support for multicast communication. In addition, continuous data streams such as audio and video require real-time performance guarantees to ensure quality of service. We introduce a model for real-time multicast channels and present a set of scalable algorithms for the dynamic joining and leaving of destination nodes in this environment. In particular we present an algorithm for finding a good attachment point to the multicast tree. We also describe detailed admission tests that preserve the guarantees given to existing channels. Our algorithm for a leaving node specifies in particular the resources to be released in the network. We also discuss tree reorganization issues.

Reference-contexts: From the user's point of view these channels are independent; in order to keep multicast support simple and general, the coordination and control of the M multicast channels is not built into the network, but left to the higher layers of the protocol hierarchy. For example floor passing <ref> [1] </ref> or multicast ordering [14, 15] are handled in higher layers. The nodes in a multicast tree perform the following operations: * They route packets and forward them to output links (switching).

Reference-contexts: Several research laboratories have implemented ST-II successfully [20, 18, 12, 13]. The OSI community is also working on a new generation of transport protocols. The concept of a Quality of Service requested by the user and guaranteed by the transport service is an important part of these new protocols <ref> [2] </ref>. Support for multi-peer connections is also included in the new proposal. Details of multicast algorithms or operational implementations have not yet been reported. None of the approaches mentioned above allow dynamic joining and leaving of nodes under real-time conditions.

Reference-contexts: The find-candidate-node subroutine will be described in 3.3.1. The unicast-admission-test determines whether 7 a node on the path from the joining node to the attachment candidate can handle the additional (guaranteed) traffic. It is identical to the server tests for admission control for Tenet unicast channels <ref> [10] </ref>. The multicast-admission-test subroutine will be described in detail in 3.3.2. The destination-test subroutine considers the QoS requirements of the new destination and will also be described in 3.3.2. <p> The reader is referred to earlier Tenet publications for a detailed discussion of these [11, 7].

Other local parameters that characterize a channel i and each of its outgoing links l in node n can be derived similarly. They are similar to the parameters relevant to real-time unicast channels as described in <ref> [10] </ref>, but augmented by a link identifier l where appropriate: t n;i : maximum packet service time, w n;i : local minimum probability of buffer overflow. 12 Admission Test for CPU Power When a packet arrives on one of the channels, a copy of it has to be made at node

Reference-contexts: For example floor passing [1] or multicast ordering <ref> [14, 15] </ref> are handled in higher layers. The nodes in a multicast tree perform the following operations: * They route packets and forward them to output links (switching). <p> It is also free to enforce a sender selection discipline (such as floor passing), or to implement protocols for multicast ordering <ref> [14] </ref>. In our example in Figure 2, both sources are sending to the same target set consisting of destinations D2, D3 and D5. If a source wants to send to a target set, the source asks for establishment of a channel to that target set.

Reference-contexts: Again, the main difference between a unicast channel and a multicast channel is that the test has to consider each outgoing link l. The details of all these admission tests can be found in <ref> [16] </ref>. In addition to verifying that enough computing power and buffer space are available at the attachment node, we must also take the QoS requirements of the new destination node into account. <p> For each performance bound of channel i a separate test has to be made: * the D-Test for the end-to-end delay bound D max;i * the J-Test for the end-to-end delay jitter bound J max;i The details of these tests can be found in <ref> [16] </ref>. <p> In this computation, the end-to-end performance requirements of the complete route from the source to the new destination must be considered, but only parameters at nodes along p c;opt are relaxed. The details of these computations can be found in <ref> [16] </ref>. Let us now come back to our example in Figure 2, and let us consider the attachment for node D6. Candidate nodes for attaching D6 were the router n, the router at D5, and the router at D3.

Reference-contexts: The only clean solution is to reserve the resources on the new tree first, switch over in an atomic operation, and then release the resources along the old tree. Obviously additional resources are required during the reorganization process. Detailed algorithms for dynamic channel management can be found in <ref> [17] </ref>. In our example we can reorganize the tree for channel 1 after destination D3 has left. We assume that the current path from D4 to D6 via two intermediate nodes is no longer desirable. The tree reorganization sketched above would reorganize the subtree of the branch node at D4.

Reference-contexts: It is popular for workstation conferencing and seminar broadcasting. Multicast IP does not use resource reservation, and does not provide performance guarantees for multimedia data streams. The ST-II protocol (Internet Stream Protocol Version 2, <ref> [19] </ref>) was also developed as an Internet protocol suite extension. It is a connection-oriented network layer protocol supporting multicast. Unlike multicast IP, it guarantees end-to-end bandwidth and delay. <p> Details of multicast algorithms or operational implementations have not yet been reported. None of the approaches mentioned above allow dynamic joining and leaving of nodes under real-time conditions. ST-II comes closest to our approach, but in the current version all join operations have to be managed by the source <ref> [19] </ref>. Thus, dynamic joins do not scale well. We consider scalable dynamic join and leave operations to be an important requirement for multimedia applications in digital networks. In Section 2 of this paper we introduce our model for real-time multicast communication; it is largely based on Tenet Scheme 2.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a multicast channel connects a source to exactly one target set. Just as destinations are free to dynamically join and 5 leave target sets, sources are free to dynamically establish and tear down channels. When a new multicast channel is established, a tree routing algorithm similar to <ref> [22, 21] </ref> is invoked. It determines a tree topology from the source to all nodes currently in the target set.
