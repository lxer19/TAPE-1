Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction DIADEM <ref> [1] </ref> is a software platform for implementing real-time Dynamic Event Management systems. Event management is at the heart of all management and control processes. Events arise from process logic, real-time conditions, state space conditions, synchronization needs, asynchronous interrupts, and user inputs.

Reference-contexts: The following examples illustrate some of the uses of DIADEM in embedded systems. Automobile Control This application area includes various automobile control functions such as engine, brake and body control, and stability and handling enhancement. <ref> [2] </ref> DIADEM is also being used for integrating the operation of multiple on-vehicle control systems, an essential feature in many of the emerging automobile control functions.

Reference-contexts: application for trading and electronic funds transfer, the per server throughput was over 100,000 application-level transactions per hour with databasing and networking enabled. 1.5 Tools Interfaces The DIADEM model is closely related to simulation tools such as SHIFT [6, 7, 8] on one side and verification tools such as KRONOS <ref> [4, 9] </ref> and HyTech [5] on the other side. Restricting SHIFT for efficiency of execution, in DIADEM differential equations are not numerically integrated and event synchronization is performed in an input-output manner rather than in a parallel synchronous manner.
