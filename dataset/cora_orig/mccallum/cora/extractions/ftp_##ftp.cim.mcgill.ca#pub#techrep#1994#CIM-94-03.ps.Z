Reference-contexts: However it is still desirable to choose forms in which physical attributes can be ascribed to model parameters in an intuitive manner. The finite-element representations introduced by Pentland and his colleagues are a case in point <ref> [3, 7] </ref>. For our purposes, where shape is initially partitioned into part-oriented segments, superellip-soids are attractive both in the range of shapes they can represent as well as their computational simplicity.

Reference-contexts: Finally, one must consider the stability of model parameters. Representations based on superquadrics, for example, pose a number of problems due to degeneracies in shape and orientation. Other parametric forms, e.g. algebraic surfaces <ref> [5] </ref>, are sometimes less problematic and can offer a more stable basis for recognition purposes. However it is still desirable to choose forms in which physical attributes can be ascribed to model parameters in an intuitive manner.

Reference-contexts: However, the discussion of this method is beyond the scope of this paper. We begin in Section 2 with a brief overview of the inverse theory <ref> [12] </ref> and then formulate the problem of model recognition. This leads to a method of deriving, for each object model instance, the conditional probability of that model given the current estimated parameters of the unknown and their covariances. <p> As a result a method may work well only in specific cases and because of the hidden implicit nature of the conditioning assumptions, cannot be easily modified to work elsewhere. For this reason we have adopted the very general inverse problem theory of Taran-tola <ref> [12] </ref>. It makes the sources of knowledge used to obtain inverse solutions explicit, so if conditioning is required the necessary assumptions about that knowledge are apparent and can be examined to see if they are realistic. <p> The logical operation of conjunction is appropriate, i.e. the solution to the inverse problem is given by the theory and the measurements and any a priori information about the models. Tarantola extends the notion of logical conjunction to define the conjunction of two states of information <ref> [12, pages 29-31] </ref>. <p> Accordingly, (1) is more general that the equations obtained through traditional approaches, but degenerates to them in specific cases. Under the conditions mentioned, the solution is identical to the Bayesian solution <ref> [12, page 61] </ref> where the a posteriori information about the model parameters is given by the marginal probability density function: (m) = M (m) D D (d) 2.2. The Part Recognition Problem. <p> Iterations 3, 4, and 6, on the other hand, consistently support the correct classification of the unknown object as the square block. 4. Conclusions In this paper we have presented a new framework for parametric shape recognition based on a probabilistic model of inverse theory introduced by Tarantola <ref> [12] </ref>. We have shown how a Bayesian recognition strategy can be derived automatically by applying the theory and have demonstrated its implementation in a system for recognizing 3-D objects based on superellipsoid parameters.

Reference-contexts: In the first experiment, recognition was performed using an unknown model computed from a sequence of views covering the visible surfaces of an unknown object. The intent of this experiment was to validate the recognition procedure against models produced by the autonomous exploration process on running to completion <ref> [14] </ref>. Twenty-four samples of each object, each scanned from three different viewpoints, were presented to test the invariance of recognition against variations in sampling and viewpoint. <p> In the limit this would consist of attempting to base recognition on data acquired from a single viewpoint and would clearly violate the assumptions implicit in the training process. Furthermore, it has been shown elsewhere that the resulting model parameters would be inherently less stable <ref> [14] </ref>. However, should the procedure still retain some of its earlier selectivity | as evidenced by a low degree of false positive matches | then an incremental procedure becomes a possibility.

Reference-contexts: Information Obtained from Measurements. Much of the knowledge we have about a problem comes in the form of experimental measurements of observable parameters. In our system <ref> [15] </ref>, we obtain an estimate of the observed model parameters d obs , and also an estimate of their uncertainty in the covariance operator C d .
