Reference-contexts: In particular this means, that for every n 6 there does not exist a so called uniformly optimal graph with n vertices and m (n) edges (a graph is uniformly optimal if it is optimal for every p 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>). In all these results reliability functions cross only once in (0; 1). Till recently no examples of pairs of graphs have been known whose all-terminal or two-terminal re-liabilities cross more than twice and only one example (up to some trivial operations) of exactly two crossings. <p> were reported at the 25th Southeastern International Conference, Florida, March 94 and at the 7th International Conference on Random Structures and Algorithms, Atlanta, May, 1995, and were preliminary described in [9, 10]. 2 Notions, notation, and preliminaries We consider finite and undirected graphs with possible parallel edges and no loops <ref> [1] </ref>. Let V (G) and E (G) be the sets of vertices and edges of a graph G, respectively. A random graph (G; p) is a graph G where every edge exists independently with probability p (and so q = 1 p can be interpreted as the edge failure probability).

Reference-contexts: Till recently no examples of pairs of graphs have been known whose all-terminal or two-terminal re-liabilities cross more than twice and only one example (up to some trivial operations) of exactly two crossings. This example was found by the aid of computer <ref> [2] </ref>. (In 7.4 below we give a very simple construction that provides infinitely many pairs of graphs with exactly two crossings.) A natural question is how many crossings can occur among all-terminal (respectively, two-terminal) reliability functions for graphs with the same number of vertices and edges.

Reference-contexts: This is so called two-terminal reliability of G. Clearly all-terminal and two-terminal reliabilities depend on the reliability p of edges. For that reason, we will call them all-terminal and two-terminal reliability functions. Many papers are devoted to the study of various properties of network reliability functions (see, for example, <ref> [3] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The existence of a t-threshold series of 2-terminal graphs shows that by using many sufficiently non-reliable relays it is possible to build a circuit which functions as a sufficiently reliable relay. - 2 - In <ref> [4, 5] </ref> we have described a construction that for every t 2 (0; 1) provides a so called t-threshold series of asymptotically optimal graphs. <p> In other words, the question is whether the reliability functions of different graphs of the same size can cross. In <ref> [4] </ref> we observed that there are graphs with the same number of vertices and edges whose all-terminal reliability polynomials cross (i.e. the difference of the polynomials has a root in (0,1)). The same is true for two-terminal reliabilities of graphs.

Reference-contexts: graphs of the same size whose reliability polynomials have a touching point (i.e. the difference of the polynomials has a root in (0; 1) of an even multiplicity), (q2) how many touching points such polynomials may have, (q3) how large the multiplicity of a touching point - 3 - In <ref> [8] </ref> we proved that for all integers M and N there exist pairs of graphs whose all-terminal reliabilities cross (touch) more than N times with the multiplicities greater than M . The same was shown to be true also for two-terminal reliability.

Many papers are devoted to the study of various properties of network reliability functions (see, for example, [3]). For instance, Moore and Shannon <ref> [12] </ref> have studied properties of the two-terminal reliability function in order to find a construction that for every t 2 (0; 1) provides a series of two-terminal graphs whose two-terminal reliability functions tend to a t-threshold function on (0; 1) (f (x) is a t-threshold function if f (x) = 1
