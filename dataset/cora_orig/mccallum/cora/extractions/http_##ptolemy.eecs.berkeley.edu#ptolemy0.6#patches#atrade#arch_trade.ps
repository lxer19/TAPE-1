Title: ABSTRACT  
Abstract: A perennial problem in the process of de veloping signal processing systems is identifying an architecture which meets the computational and memory needs of the algorithm yet is still affordable in terms of cost, size, and complexity. To aid in making this decision, an architecture trade tool, using the Ptolemy k ernel, has been developed. The purpose of this tool is to pro vide the user with an easy mechanism of specifying a mapping of algorithmic functional blocks onto an architecture, and simulating its performance. The goal is to allo w the user to quickly e valuate many architectures and mappings at a high-le vel to determine whether or not the y satisfy basic criteria, and w arrant further investigation. These criteria include computational and memory requirements as well as other system metrics (e.g. size, power, and reliability, etc.) which are often important in selecting an architecture.

Reference-contexts: The Sanders RASSP team consists of Sanders, Motorola, Hughes, and ISX. execute a performance model, and pro vide feedback on the results. The architectural trade tool starts with a functional representation of the algorithm using the Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) domain of Ptolemy <ref> [1] </ref>. Ptolemy is a software environment developed at the University of California at Berkeley that supports heterogeneous system simulation and design using a several different models of computation, each implemented in a separate domain.

Reference-contexts: However, certain other system met-rics must often be considered as well. As a result, in addition to the Gantt chart pro vided after each simulation run, the architectural trade tool also gives some feedback on the following system metrics <ref> [2] </ref>: function, environment, interfaces, schedule, cost, processor , interconnect, software, size, weight, power, reliability, testability, maintainability, fault tolerance, scalability, and standards. These system metrics are estimated using simple models with stored manufacturer specifications, historical data, and certain infor mation from the mapping and performance simulation.
