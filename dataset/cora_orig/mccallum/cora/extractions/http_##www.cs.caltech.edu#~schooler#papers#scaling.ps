Title: The Impact of Scaling on a Multimedia Connection Architecture  
Author: Eve M. Schooler 
Affiliation: USC/Information Sciences Institute  
Abstract: As the last two meetings of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) have shown, Internet teleconferencing has arrived. Packet audio and video have now been multicast to approximately 170 different hosts in 10 countries, and for the November 1992 meeting the number of remote participants is likely to be substantially larger. Yet the network infrastructure to support wide scale packet teleconferencing is not in place. This paper discusses the impact of scaling on our efforts to define a multimedia teleconferencing architecture. Three scaling dimensions of particular interest include: (i) very large numbers of participants per conference, (ii) many simultaneous teleconferences, and (iii) a widely dispersed user population. Here we present a strawman architecture and describe how conference-specific information is captured, then conveyed among end-systems. We provide a comparison of connection models and outline the tradeoffs and requirements that change as we travel along each dimension of scale.

Reference-contexts: However, impromptu feedback channels are still needed, along with support for dynamic membership. At this size, authentication becomes impractical to provide. The IETF teleconferences were the first medium sized experiments in the Internet <ref> [1] </ref>. Large conferences (hundreds of thousands or millions of participants) are analogous to TV broadcasts. Information is disseminated in one direction, sessions are pre-arranged or even permanent, and descriptions of sessions remain static. All except the largest conferences should accommodate subconferencing.

Reference-contexts: The CM's other principal responsibility is configuration management of end system heterogeneity. End system differences include asymmetries in available media, codec mismatches, variations in bandwidth capabilities, transport incompatibilities, etc. Accordingly, the CM's distributed control protocol negotiates a workable set of capabilities among group members <ref> [2] </ref>. The intent of the architecture is to facilitate interoperation among users' teleconferencing implementations across the Internet. Therefore, the connection manager is used to convey high-level configuration descriptions from users and peer CMs, into more detailed descriptions for media agents, which in turn translate them into real-time flow specifications [9]. <p> work needs to be done to define useful configuration descriptions at each stage of the process. 4 Acknowledgment These ideas stem from conversations with colleagues at ISI, discussions held within the IETF Audio/Video Transport working group and the RemConf Architecture BOFs, deployment and evaluation of prototype implementations, and comments on <ref> [2, 3] </ref> by H.Schulzrinne, Y.Chang and J.Whaley.

Reference-contexts: 1 Overview of a Connection Management Architecture We have proposed a multimedia connection architecture that has served as the basis for discussion within the IETF's Remote Conferencing Architecture BOF <ref> [3] </ref>. At the core of the architecture is the notion of a connection manager (CM), which resides at each end system to coordinate the orchestration, maintenance and interaction of multi-user sessions. <p> work needs to be done to define useful configuration descriptions at each stage of the process. 4 Acknowledgment These ideas stem from conversations with colleagues at ISI, discussions held within the IETF Audio/Video Transport working group and the RemConf Architecture BOFs, deployment and evaluation of prototype implementations, and comments on <ref> [2, 3] </ref> by H.Schulzrinne, Y.Chang and J.Whaley.

Reference-contexts: Once notified, the media agents reserve any devices upon which they rely (cameras, codecs, etc.). The initiator's CM then negotiates with the other participants' CMs. Finally, each CM instructs its local media agents to establish real-time transport sessions <ref> [8] </ref>. Connection Control Protocol Connection Manager Connection Control Configuration Control Real-Time Transport Protocol Teleconf Application Video codec Video Agent Audio Agent Participants: Bob, Steve, and Joe Audio: high qual Video: adequate qual Speed: moderate Cost: moderate Groupware: mmconf Video agents: H.261 MPEG PicTel ... Audio agents: PCM ADPCM ... <p> The complication is that there are a fixed number of multicast addresses. Because most telecollaborations will be transient, address assignment and re-assignment will be highly dynamic. A global scheme is required to avoid unwanted address collisions and to promote reasonable address space sharing. A plan is presented in <ref> [8] </ref> to partition addresses among a hierarchy of multicast address servers; addresses are borrowed from other servers of equal stature in the hierarchy, and servers re-use addresses by exploiting locality.

Reference-contexts: The intent of the architecture is to facilitate interoperation among users' teleconferencing implementations across the Internet. Therefore, the connection manager is used to convey high-level configuration descriptions from users and peer CMs, into more detailed descriptions for media agents, which in turn translate them into real-time flow specifications <ref> [9] </ref>. In a simplified scenario, an application asks the CM for high quality audio and adequate quality video over moderate speed links for moderate cost. The configuration directory service is consulted by the CM and identifies media agents that both meet this specification and are available.
