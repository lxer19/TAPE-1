Title: Structural Similarity as Guidance in Case-Based Design

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to determine structural similarity as guidance for adaptation in case-based reasoning (Cbr). We advance structural similarity assessment which provides not only a single numeric value but the most specific structure two cases have in common, inclusive of the modification rules needed to obtain this structure from the two cases. Our approach treats retrieval, matching and adaptation as a group of dependent processes. This guarantees the retrieval and matching of not only similar but adaptable cases. Both together enlarge the overall problem solving performance of Cbr and the explainability of case selection and adaptation considerably. Although our approach is more theoretical in nature and not restricted to a specific domain, we will give an example taken from the domain of industrial building design. Additionally, we will sketch two prototypical implementations of this approach.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a finite, heterogeneous, and finitary signature is assumed. This is taken as a basis for building terms and formulae, as usual. The detailed formal description of the signature used to represent cases structurally can be found in <ref> [Bor93] </ref>. Equational knowledge about functions and their relations is formalized . Note that each solution description contains the corresponding problem description. There is a function with its inverse which realizes the transformation of the attribute-based descriptions into structural ones and vice versa.

Reference-contexts: Changes in case or background knowledge influence both similarity assessment and adaptation. Structural similarity assessment is a computationally expensive process. Inspired by the work of Dedre Gentner and Kenneth D. Forbus <ref> [GF91] </ref>, we will tune computationally cheap, fast preselection and expensive structural similarity assessment to complete each other. The procedure (marked by arrows) is as follows.

Reference-contexts: Structural similarity is defined as the most common structure of cases and the rules needed to determine it. It is able to guide solution adaptation. Conventional Cbr systems which use causal models (e.g., Casey [Kot88], Swale [KLO86], Chef <ref> [Ham86] </ref>) treat retrieval, matching (or justification), and adaptation separately one after each other. By contrast, we will show that the integration of these stages improves the suitability and performance of Cbr significantly.

Reference-contexts: The features are preclassified as important with respect to retrieval. Similarity is assessed by a numeric computation and results in a single number which is meant to reflect all aspects of the similarity. There are approaches (e.g., <ref> [Hin92] </ref>) which try to capture the plausible inferences intrinsically through the organization or indexing of knowledge. Constraints on a problem serve as indices into a design memory.

Reference-contexts: To use ellipses instead of rectangles is a very useful graphical trick: Ellipses overlap only in a few points. Thus, information on different levels of abstraction can be displayed simultaneously. For a detailed introduction into this representation scheme, the reader is referred to <ref> [Hov93] </ref>. In Fig. 2, thinly drawn circles denote places where accesses can be placed. Bold drawn circles Fig. 2. Case-Based Design of Air Supply Nets denote places reserved for main accesses. Ellipses denote areas where connections of supply accesses can be placed. <p> To realize our approach we need two different types of case representations as well as a complementing rule-based representation of proper case modifications. The attribute-based case representation provides visually prominent features of objects. Following the work of Ludger Hovestadt <ref> [Hov93] </ref> each object (circle or ellipse) will be represented by its spatial dimensions and nine further attributes like time at which this object was created, aspect which assumes one of `return air,' `fresh air,' etc., and morphology which refers to `access,' `connection', etc.

Therefore, a finite, heterogeneous, and finitary signature is assumed. This is taken as a basis for building terms and formulae, as usual.
