Abstract: Details can be added to spline surfaces by applying displacement maps. However, the computational intensity of displacement mapping prevents its use for interactive design. In this paper we explore a form of simulated displacement that can be used for interactive design by providing a preview of true displacements at low computational cost. Displacement mapping is a standard and useful tool for realistic rendering [3,8], and it has been suggested for application to surface approximation [6]. Because of its computational cost, however, it has not yet been fully explored as a design tool. In [4] a restricted form of displacement mapping was investigated for use in interactive design. Composite surfaces were constructed by layering a sequence of detail surfaces onto a base surface. Each detail was formulated as a vector displacement fleld and mapped onto a region of the base. The process was restricted in that, in order to achieve continuity between detail and base, it was necessary that the detail share a common parametric domain with the base and possess a knot structure derivable from the base by reflnement, a setting studied recently by Weller and Hagen [9]. These restrictions permitted the computations for displacement mapping to be simplifled to such an extent that interactive design was feasible. Here we extend the techniques of [4] to remove some of those restrictions. True displacement mapping involves a vector-valued function d(r; s) that is nonzero over a compact domain (r; s) 2 D, a 1-1 transformation T of that domain into the domain (u; v) 2 S of a surface (point-valued) S 0 (u; v), and the resulting composition S 1 (u; v) = S 0 (u; v) + d(T 1 (u; v)). (Bold, lower case letters denote vectors; bold upper case letters are transformations; Roman and Greek lower case letters are scalars; Roman upper case letters are points, and calligraphic letters are domains.) The continuity of S 1 is controlled by the continuity of S 0 , T and d. In the surface design setting that we wish to consider, the intent of employing a displacement map is to achieve the "pasting" of a detail surface D(r; s) onto a base surface S 0 (u; v). The function d is xIntroduction
