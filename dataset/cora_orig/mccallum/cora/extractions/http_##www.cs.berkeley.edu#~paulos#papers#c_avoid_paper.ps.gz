Reference-contexts: Reif and Sharir [17] prove the existence of collision free paths in this, monatomic time, higher-dimensional space. Prioritizing the order in which to plan the individual robot paths is explored by Erdmann and Lozano-Perez [7] and later by Buckley [4]. Aggarwal and Fujimura <ref> [1] </ref> describe a specialized use of the cell-decomposition approach in space-time to handle rotations of planar robots. When objects are moving non-deterministicly, Tsubouchi and Arimoto [21] show that it is sometimes possible to track and forecast the motions of these other moving obstacles and plan paths based on those results.

Reference-contexts: This necessitates the construction of the end conditions of the B-spline to have position specification (i.e. end vertex interpolation), and some derivatives at zero. We can achieve this by applying the technique of phantom vertices developed by Barsky <ref> [2] </ref>. In essence this is a method for determining the correct placement of extra control vertices before the first vertex and after 8 the last vertex to achieve some specified condition (s) at the ends of the B-spline curve.

Reference-contexts: However, we propose the use of a continuous jerk path since it strongly relates to the impact characteristic of the loading of the system [13] as well as the rate of change of force producing acceleration <ref> [10] </ref>. Since we desire C 3 continuity (continuous jerk), we adopt the use of fifth order (k = 5) B-splines. The basis function is of fourth degree and composed of five piecewise segments denoted by b i .

Reference-contexts: If we make a path modification while the robot is in motion, these phantom vertices can be easily recomputed to maintain the end-condition constraints. 9 3.3 Robot Controller Robot controllers are typically quite diverse by nature of their underlying hardware differences. Recent approaches to standardize such controller interfaces <ref> [14] </ref> have yet to gain popularity. However, our trajectory generation control tool provides a wealth of output information, providing position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk verses time. These are easy to compute using the recurrence relation of Equations 2 and 3.

Reference-contexts: We have developed this within the framework of an industrial assembly robot and parallelized assembly sequences to increase production throughput. A typical pick-and-place/peg-in-hole assembly technique <ref> [16] </ref> adopted this system and was parallelized, resulting in a 40 percent reduction in assembly time. Finally, we demonstrate a user visualization tool for our system.

Reference-contexts: One approach is to add time to the dimension of the configuration space. In general a k-dimensional changing environment can be represented as (k + 1)-dimensional space-time. Collision free path planning then occurs in this higher-dimensional space-time. Reif and Sharir <ref> [17] </ref> prove the existence of collision free paths in this, monatomic time, higher-dimensional space. Prioritizing the order in which to plan the individual robot paths is explored by Erdmann and Lozano-Perez [7] and later by Buckley [4].
