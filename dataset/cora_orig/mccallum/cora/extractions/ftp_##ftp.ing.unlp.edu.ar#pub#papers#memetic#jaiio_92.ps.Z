Abstract: A new heuristic method for the Quadratic Assignment Problem based on the use of a "Computational Ecology" and a modified version of Hillier-Connors heuristic HC-63 are presented in this paper. The method is intended to include another metaheuristic called Tabu Search to increase the diversity of solutions before recombining them to create new configurations which are used to restart the search. Its intrinsic parallelism was checked when implemented on a parallel computer (Transputer system).

Reference-contexts: Very recently, a number of techniques started to depart from traditional GA methods although they also shared two of the basic ingredients of GA, Reproduction and Crossover [14] <ref> [1] </ref>. These techniques have been tentatively called "memetic algorithms" due to the introduction of the word "meme" by R. Dawkins to designate the "unit of imitation". The "meme" would play the analogous role of the gene but in cultural evolution [11] [3]. <p> They presented results with N p = 7; 4 neighbours, the global best solution with a weight of two and the current configuration. We used the method proposed by Brown, Huntley & Spillane which is similar to the PMX operator used by Goldberg and Lingle <ref> [1] </ref>. It creates a new cyclic permutation O (for offspring) using two parent configurations (P 1 ; P 2 ) and the following procedure 1. Each of the parent structures is partitioned in three sections by randomly drawing two breaking points. 2.

Reference-contexts: Heuristics are often considered by many scientists as "rules-of-thumb" which aid to the solution of specific problems but lack rigorousness. However, in combinatorial optimization where the concept of effectiveness <ref> [4] </ref> plays a fundamental role, heuristics should be regarded as part of an interplay with algorithms, an earlier stage in scientific discovery.

Reference-contexts: Tabu Search for the QAP Our basic heuristic strategy (HC-91) does not include backtracking, that is it halts after finding a local minimum. We have decided to include Tabu Search (TS) to explore neighboring solutions <ref> [6] </ref>. From a given configuration, TS seeks among the neighboring configurations (this depends on the move set), trying to find that one that has the best evaluation (regarding the objective function, for example).

If the same object is assigned to a particular place more times than a given threshold, then it is also assigned in the same place in the offspring.

Reference-contexts: For the QAP we must cite the H63 due to Hillier, the HC-66 due to Hillier and Connors <ref> [15] </ref>, the CRAFT due to Armour and Buffa and the `Biased Sampling' proposed by Nugent et al. With the exemption of the latter, they are all deterministic procedures. <p> Eventually it also considers diagonal moves <ref> [15] </ref>. We can see other difference in that H63 accepts "every" positive cost reduction, while H63-66 does not, some changes are discarded due to the "threshold". These heuristics are not only effective regarding the low-cost solutions it yields, but it also gains from the use of the MDT. <p> Among the collection of techniques described above, HC63-66 from Hillier & Connors was selected, showing a good performance in the average final cost in several different instances of the QAP with sizes from five to thirty department <ref> [15] </ref> along with a reduced computing time. This heuristic was modified for a new approach in which objects are selected according to its relative contribution to the objective function. Now we introduce a new heuristic which has many similarities with the previously cited methods.

Reference-contexts: (QAP) is a combinatorial optimization problem which is a representative of the important class of problems known as NP-hard, thus it is important to develop and test heuristics for it since membership in this class means that solution times are likely to be at least exponential with respect to N <ref> [16] </ref>. Heuristics are often considered by many scientists as "rules-of-thumb" which aid to the solution of specific problems but lack rigorousness.
