Abstract: Finding one's way through a complex virtual environment is a standard task in 3D graphics and virtual reality applications. Constrained navigation is a method that appropriately restricts the user's degrees of freedom when there is a poor match between the goal of an exploration activity, the control device, and the user's familiarity with the exploration domain. The fundamental prerequisite for the adoption of constrained navigation is that the designer can significantly improve the quality of the user's experience by choosing a predetermined parametric set of viewing parameters or algorithms. We discuss families of constrained navigation methods appropriate to desktop and immersive virtual reality applications. The natural tools and characteristics for these two environments are quite distinct. On the desktop, the ubiquity of the 2D mouse suggests that a major application consists of motions in relatively unrestricted 2D subspaces. For immersive environments that support head-tracked motion, in contrast, one must limit the user's physical motion, stabilize the direction of the forward view, and maintain the display of significant information in peripheral directions. Controlling the glass elevator of a spatially immersive virtual environment requires attention to additional details such as 3D controller gestures and the suppression of disorienting motions. We illustrate the approach with a variety of examples, emphasizing the possibility of topologically nontrivial navigation spaces, and present the results of a preliminary user study.

Reference-contexts: Traditional 3D navigation techniques burden the user with the task of manipulating a controller with six degrees of freedom. This detracts from the user's spatial memory and causes disorientation (see, e.g., Arthur et al., <ref> [1] </ref>). However, with a constrained system, the user's burden is typi cally reduced. Navigators should thus be able to focus more on the environment instead of the controls, expediting survey knowledge development.

The 2D mouse-based interfaces described in [8] clearly extend to immersive virtual reality environments, where the virtual space of the control device can select points and orientations in a 3D volume instead of simple 2D mouse coordinates.

Reference-contexts: Appropriate interest fields can be easily defined using variants on Blinn's method for implicit surface modeling <ref> [3] </ref>. A separate interest field can in principle be supplied for each parameter, allowing, e.g., the camera focal length, to be varied independently throughout the navigation. Modulation by Data.

In order to extend this user model to other VR environments such as head-tracked displays, we will refer to the virtually movable space in which the user interacts as the PVE, or physical viewing environment.

Reference-contexts: The acquisition of cognitive maps, a special and limited application of constrained navigation, has attracted a great deal of attention as well, as exemplified in the work of Thorndyke, Goldin, and Hayes-Roth <ref> [6, 16, 15] </ref>; their general classification of spatial knowledge for geographic navigation into landmark knowledge, procedural knowledge, and survey knowledge is suggestive, though possibly not sufficiently broad to encompass navigation issues in some current VR applications.

Reference-contexts: These requirements fit into the spatial knowledge framework established by Siegel and White <ref> [14] </ref>. The ability to extract and remember features from the scene defines landmark knowledge. Survey knowledge refers to understanding the global configuration of objects. The constrained system appears naturally to facilitate development of both types of spatial knowledge.
