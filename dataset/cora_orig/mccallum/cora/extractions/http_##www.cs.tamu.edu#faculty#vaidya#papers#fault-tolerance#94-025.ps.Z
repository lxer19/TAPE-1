Reference-contexts: Clearly, simple replication improves performance at the cost of increased redundancy. An intermediate solution is to use combination of replication and simple ECC. Such schemes have been used in commercial systems <ref> [1] </ref>. This report compares reliability of memory systems formed by simple triplication (without ECC) with memory systems formed by duplicating memory modules that use ECC. Following the standard terminology, these two systems are referred to as triplex and duplex systems, respectively. Figure 1 illustrates the two systems under consideration.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, our goal now is to prove that h (p) &gt; 0. Note that h (0) = 0 and h (1=2) = 0. Also function h is differentiable in [0; 1=2]. Therefore, by Rolle's theorem <ref> [2] </ref>, at least one extrema (maxima or minima) exists between p = 0 and p = 1=2. Now, dh dp 2 = 4 (1p) 2 . Note that for p = 0, dh dp = 0 and d 2 h dp 2 &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: In the following, reliability of the triplex system is evaluated first, followed by evaluation of reliability of the three duplex systems and comparison with the triplex system. For the reliability analysis, we use the independent symmetric error model <ref> [3] </ref>. It is assumed that each bit of a codeword in memory may become erroneous independently with probability p. In reality, probability p is expected to be quite small (of the order of 10 3 or less). Reliability of the voters is assumed to 1. <p> We illustrate this with an example. Assume that the error control code used in the duplex system is a (n; k) code obtained by (possibly) shortening the distance-4 extended Hamming code <ref> [3] </ref>. For k = 16 and k = 32, Figures 2 and 3 plot the unreliability (i.e. 1reliability) for duplex and triplex systems as a function of p. For the SEC-DED code, n is equal to 22 when k = 16 and 39 when k = 32.
