Abstract: The problem is to find the order of lacing a shoe, with two parallel rows of equally-spaced lace-holes (eyelets), which requires the least total length of lace. This paper determines the total length required by the three most popular styles of lacing (for any shoe parameters), and optimizes over all possible lacings.
