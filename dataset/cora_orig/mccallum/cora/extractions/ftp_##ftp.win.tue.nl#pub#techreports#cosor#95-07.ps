Abstract: In H 2 and H 1 optimal control (semi-) stabilizing solutions of algebraic Riccati equations play an essential role. It is well-known that these solutions might have discontinuities as a function of the system parameters. The paper shows that these discontinuities are directly linked to non-left-invertibility and, in contrast to what one might think, unrelated to zeros on the imaginary axis.

Reference-contexts: A natural question is then whether the semi-stabilizing solutions depend continuously on the system parameters. There are simple examples where the solution does not depend continuously on the system parameters (see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>). On the other hand, [8] identifies a class of perturbations which guarantee a continuous behaviour. We would like to study this question in more detail.

Reference-contexts: Note that in general for continuous time systems we have to use quadratic matrix inequalities instead of Riccati equations. However, these have a 1-1 relation to Riccati equations of a lower dimension (see <ref> [5] </ref>). In particular we are interested in the stabilizing solution of these Riccati equations and quadratic matrix inequalities. However, if the system has zeros on the imaginary axis (continuous time) or on the unit circle (discrete time), we have to study semi-stabilizing solutions. <p> We have: ffi := sup inf n j A + BF 1 stable g &lt; fl From <ref> [5] </ref> we have for finite fl and " 2 (0; " fl ]: L " 6 P " 6 fl 2 where L " is the stabilizing solution of the following Riccati equation: L " = A T L " A + C T C + " 2 I (A T <p> The function f from D 0 to R nfin which assigns to each system in D 0 , the associated rank-minimizing stabilizing solution of the quadratic matrix inequality is continuous.
