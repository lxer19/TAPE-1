Title: Random Walks on Colored Graphs  
Author: Anne Condon Diane Hernek 
Date: March 1, 1994  
Abstract: We initiate a study of random walks on undirected graphs with colored edges. In our model, a sequence of colors is specified before the walk begins, and it dictates the color of edge to be followed at each step. We give tight upper and lower bounds on the expected cover time of a random walk on an undirected graph with colored edges. We show that, in general, graphs with two colors have exponential expected cover time, and graphs with three or more colors have doubly-exponential expected cover time. We also give polynomial bounds on the expected cover time in a number of interesting special cases. We describe applications of our results to understanding the dominant eigenvectors of products and weighted averages of stochastic matrices, and to problems on time-inhomogeneous Markov chains.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5 we investigate the question of whether a colored undirected graph is covered with probability one on all infinite sequences. We use a space-bounded analogue of the probabilistically checkable proof systems of <ref> [3] </ref> to show that the problem of deciding, given a colored 2 undirected graph G and a start node s, whether G is covered from s with probability one on all infinite sequences is: * Complete for nondeterministic logspace (N L) when the graph has two colors. * P SP ACE-complete <p> Next we show that the analogous problem for graphs with three or more colors is P SP ACE-complete. For the hardness result, we extend previous results on space-bounded interactive proof systems. We define a space-bounded analogue of the probabilistically checkable proof systems of <ref> [3] </ref>. A verifier is a probabilistic Turing machine that takes as input a pair (x; ), where x and are strings over the alphabet f0; 1g. The string is called a proof, and can be infinitely long. The proof is stored on a one-way infinite, read-only tape.

Reference-contexts: It follows that the stated problem is in N L since N L = coN L <ref> [10] </ref> [16]. We use the following equivalence, the proof of which is implicit in the proof of the exponential upper bound of Theorem 2.2. <p> It can also guess which of the four types of string from (2) above does not admit a path from v to t. Since such a path, if it exists, has length O (n), the techniques of Immerman <ref> [10] </ref> can be used to verify that there is no path from v to t on the guessed string. For the hardness result consider the following decision problem. <p> It follows that the original problem is in P SP ACE since P SP ACE is closed under complement <ref> [10] </ref> [16] and under the addition of nondeterminism [14]. We use the following equivalence, the proof of which is implicit in the proof of the doubly-exponential upper bound of Theorem 2.1. <p> This verification procedure can be performed in polynomial time. Since PSPACE is closed under complement <ref> [10] </ref> [16] and the addition of nondeterminism [14] this shows that deciding weak-ergodicity is in PSPACE. For hardness, we show that the membership problem for any language in P CP (log n) can be reduced to deciding weak-ergodicity.
