Abstract: MEME is a tool for discovering motifs in sets of protein or DNA sequences. This paper describes several extensions to MEME which increase its ability to find motifs in a totally unsupervised fashion, but which also allow it to benefit when prior knowledge is available. When no background knowledge is asserted, MEME obtains increased robustness from a method for determining motif widths automatically, and from probabilistic models that allow motifs to be absent in some input sequences. On the other hand, MEME can exploit prior knowledge about a motif being present in all input sequences, about the length of a motif and whether it is a palindrome, and (using Dirichlet mixtures) about expected patterns in individual motif positions. Extensive experiments are reported which support the claim that MEME benefits from, but does not require, background knowledge. The experiments use seven previously studied DNA and protein sequence families and 75 of the protein families documented in the Prosite database of sites and patterns, Release 11.1.

Reference-contexts: We define LRT () to be this significance level, so LRT () = Q ( 2 j-); where Q ( 2 j-) Q (x 2 ); x 2 = 9- ) 2=(9-) <ref> (Abramowitz & Stegun 1972) </ref>. Q (x 2 ) is the Q function for the standard normal distribution (i.e., size of the right tail), and is the difference between the number of free parameters in the model used with EM and the null model.

Reference-contexts: Introduction MEME is an unsupervised learning algorithm for discovering motifs in sets of protein or DNA sequences. This paper describes the third version of MEME. Earlier versions were described previously (Bailey & Elkan 1994), <ref> (Bailey & Elkan 1995a) </ref>. The MEME extensions on which this paper focuses are methods of incorporating background knowledge, or coping with its lack. For incorporating background knowledge, these innovations include automatic detection of inverse-complement palindromes in DNA sequence datasets, and using Dirichlet mixture priors with protein sequence datasets. <p> They contain two known motifs, each occurring once in each sequence. The hth proteins contain DNA-binding features involved in gene regulation. The farn dataset contains isoprenyl-protein transferases, each with multiple appearances of three motifs. The E. coli DNA datasets, crp, lex and crplex, are described in detail in <ref> (Bailey & Elkan 1995a) </ref>. The crp sequences contain binding sites for CRP (Lawrence & Reilly 1990), while the lex sequences contain binding sites for LexA; the crplex dataset is the union of the crp and lex datasets.

Reference-contexts: Overview of MEME The principal input to MEME is a set of DNA or protein sequences. Its principal output is a series of probabilistic sequence models, each corresponding to one motif, whose parameters have been estimated by expectation maximization <ref> (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin 1977) </ref>. <p> This process is known to converge <ref> (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin 1977) </ref> to a local maximum of the likelihood function P r (Xj). Joint likelihood functions.

Reference-contexts: The TCM model type outperforms the other two model types on the farn dataset whose sequences contain multiple occurrences of multiple motifs. For comparison, the last line in Table 3 shows the performance of the motifs discovered using the Gibbs sampler <ref> (Lawrence et al. 1993) </ref>. <p> It was run with 100 independent starts (10 times the default) to maximize its chances of finding good motifs. Note that we did not tell either the Gibbs sampler or MEME how many occurrences of a particular motif a particular sequence has as was done in <ref> (Lawrence et al. 1993) </ref>. The ROC of the MEME motifs found using the ZOOPS model type without background information is as good or better than that of the sampler motifs for five of seven datasets.

Reference-contexts: The number of true positive (tp), false positive (fp), true negative (tn) and false negative (fn) hits was tallied. From these, recall = tp=(tp + f n) and precision = tp=(tp + f p) were computed. We also calculated the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) <ref> (Swets 1988) </ref> of the MEME motifs. The ROC statistic is the integral of the ROC curve, which plots the true positive proportion, tpp = recall = tp=(tp + f n), versus the false positive proportion, f pp = f p=(f p + tn).
