Abstract: The generation of transient spiral waves by swing-amplification in self-gravitating disks is now regarded as the underlying reason for the predominance of spiral patterns in galaxies. The physics of this process is well understood and should be readily applicable to gaseous accretion disks. There is less agreement on a mechanism for the maintenance of long-lived spirals, or the continuous regeneration of fresh spirals, in galaxies, but most current ideas in this area do not seem likely to carry over to gaseous disks.
