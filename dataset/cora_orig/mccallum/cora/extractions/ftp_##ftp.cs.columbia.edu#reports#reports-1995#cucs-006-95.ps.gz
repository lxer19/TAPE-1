Abstract: This paper overviews the electronic and all-optical design and the gigabit per second electronic implementation of a switch based on the Isochronets high-speed network architecture. The absence of frame processing in the Iso-chronets architecture is core to the switch efficiency and multi-protocol support. The electronic design is low cost and uses simple off-the-shelf components, while the optical design can be realized with current optical devices. The switch interface is simple and provides novel services such as propagation of synchronization signals to upper protocol layers. The switch makes it possible the negotiation of Quality of Service (QoS) while promoting flexible resource sharing. The modular switch designs are scaleable in number of nodes and link speed. Using faster implementation technology, the electronic design can reach scores of gigabits per second, while the all-optical design can potentially operate at terabits per second.

Reference-contexts: An all-optical realization of Isochronets must avoid buffering at intermediate switches. The design proposed in this section uses wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) <ref> [1, 4, 5] </ref> to allocate one wavelength for each band. The architecture for a single tree per band is depicted in Figure 16. Each wavelength is depicted using a different gray scale.

Reference-contexts: Besides being efficient, an adequate switching mechanism for HSNs must maximize bandwidth use while providing the necessary Quality of Service (QoS) that integrated data, voice, and video applications need. Current switching techniques, Packet Switching (PS) and Circuit Switching (CS) <ref> [2, 11] </ref>, may not appropriately satisfy these goals. For example, PS has limited support for guaranteed QoS, while CS enables limited bandwidth sharing. The goal of this section is to introduce the main challenges in designing and implementing a HSN switch. Switching efficiency. <p> The entire network is viewed as a routing medium consisting of routing trees. Bandwidth is time and spacedivided among these routes. Sources need access respective trees during their band times, seeing the network as a timedivided medium, much like Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) <ref> [2, 11] </ref>. This technique, accordingly, is called Route Division Multiple Access (RDMA). A contention band is a band that may be shared by all sources in the tree simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: Current switching techniques rely on the fact that processing efficiency significantly prevails transmission efficiency. Unfortunately, the scenario is likely to change when HSN link speeds reach hundreds of gigabits or even terabits per second. For example, at 2.4 Gb/s, a switch has only 177 ns to process an ATM <ref> [3] </ref> cell (53 bytes). It is imperative to build switching technologies that scale efficiently with link speeds. Implementation complexity and cost. The provision of multimedia services to a large market will significantly increase the complexity and size of HSNs. <p> Input queue buffering is performed after the serial to parallel conversion, simplifying queue design. In Isochronets, input or output queueing delivers the same performance. This is not usually the case in normal switching technologies due to the Head of the Line (HoL) blocking effect <ref> [3] </ref>. HoL blocking happens, for example, in packet switching technology with input queueing of packets. When the HoL is addressed to an output port that is busy, it must wait until the output becomes idle.

The objective of the data transmission buffer is to gather data from the slower host machine so that it can be sent at full speed through the switch. <p> The idea is to relay such signals upwards through the protocol stack so that the periphery protocol stack can use to implement synchronous services with strict QoS guarantees. A whole new synchronous protocol stack (see reference <ref> [7] </ref>) can be implemented 17 using this feature. These signals are novel when compared to traditional STM synchronization in many respects. Firstly, the necessary accuracy of Isoswitch signals is much lower. For example, an 8 bit slot in a STM frame at 2.4 Gb/s transmission rate lasts 3.3 ns.

Reference-contexts: The control unit contains the AL that, based on the information in the CT, configures the switching fabric to provide the desired input and output connectivity. The host also synchronize its clock with other nodes using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) <ref> [8] </ref> and provide synchronization to the control unit. The input line card receives bitserial data from the network trunks and convert them into bit-parallel words that are routed to the proper output ports by the switching fabric.

Reference-contexts: The optical Isochronet implementation has many advantages when compared with traditional WDM. First, a small number of wavelengths (at most n, where n is the number of switches in the network) are needed. Second, no pre-allocation of wavelength or frame processing is necessary for communication. Most recent schemes (see <ref> [9] </ref> for a survey of such schemes) need to provide a special control channel for the reservation of wavelength prior to communication. These schemes suffer the drawbacks of reservation schemes, such as round-trip allocation delay, necessity for rapidly-tunable receivers/transmitters, and dedicated bandwidth.

Other schemes (also in [9]) switch frames, with the added delay for media conversion and frame processing. Third, the implementation described is cheaper since it only needs to tune when adjusting the band sizes, which occurs at much slower rates than the speed of incoming frames.

Reference-contexts: This technology is relatively slow, but was chose due to the flexibility provided in implementing prototype systems. To get a feel of how slow the 4005H LCAs operate, the implementation of a single D flip-flop <ref> [10] </ref> in the chip can achieve a throughput of only 38.5 MHz and the minimal latency through a single gate is 5 ns. Additionally, the high-level specification is compiled into LCA gates that may be positioned far apart, diminishing even more the overall speed.
