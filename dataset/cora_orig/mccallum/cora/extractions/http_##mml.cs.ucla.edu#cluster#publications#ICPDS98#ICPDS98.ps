Abstract: We describe the design and implementation of the RIO (Randomized I/O) multimedia object server which manages a set of parallel disks and supports real-time throughput and statistical delay guarantees. The original implementation, on an SMP (Sun Microsystems E4000), has been ported to a cluster of PCs. The new version uses a similar philosophy with respect to allocation of data storage and scheduling of requests. However the parallel "shared nothing" architecture raises all the issues of latency, scalability, etc. that are familiar in parallel and distributed systems. Our requirements are particularly demanding since we expect to support a variety of multimedia applications with varying workload requirements and data reference patterns. 3D interactive applications, video, hypermedia and interactive scientific visualization of terabyte size data sets are among the applications we support. This paper details the design issues we addressed and the results of detailed simulation studies which dictated the design choices made.

Reference-contexts: The access pattern to storage objects thus depends on the speeds and paths selected by the user, which makes prediction imperfect at best. 3D virtual world models have been used for different applications such as architectural building design <ref> [1] </ref>, urban city models [4], scientific visualization [5][2], etc.; and will be increasingly common in the future. Not only do applications such as virtual environments produce unpredictable access patterns but we also want to concurrently support multiple user sessions in which different media types are being accessed.

Reference-contexts: However these same constraints can also reduce the capacity for short term load balancing during both normal operation as well as degraded mode. One such 100% replication scheme is chained declustering <ref> [3] </ref>, in which half the data which is stored on a given disk i is replicated in the next logically consecutive disk i + 1. This scheme is illustrated in logically consecutive disks.

Reference-contexts: For example we see that even as little as 25% replication provides a significant decrease in the delay bound that can be guaranteed with probability 1 10 6 ; particularly under relatively high load. (This observation was also made in <ref> [6] </ref> based on an analytic model of the same type of system we analyze here but with more restrictive assumptions.) 2.1 Fault tolerance The use of partial replication as described in the last sections is an effective method for providing short term load balance among the parallel disks.

Reference-contexts: In this approach, the total number D of disks in the system are divided into N A disk arrays with D A = D=N A disks each. Each disk array is a RAID level 5 [8] with parity group declustering <ref> [7] </ref> that stores data organized as parity groups of size G distributed on D A different disks (G 1 data blocks and 1 parity block; G D A ). A fraction ff of the data blocks are then randomly replicated across all disks of the system.

Reference-contexts: However in order to provide tolerance to disk failures we need to consider alternative schemes. There are basically two approaches; one is to use full replication and the other is to use parity groups such as used in RAID schemes <ref> [8] </ref>. One possibility is to use RAID technology to provide fault tolerance and partial replication of data blocks to provide short term load balancing. <p> In this approach, the total number D of disks in the system are divided into N A disk arrays with D A = D=N A disks each. Each disk array is a RAID level 5 <ref> [8] </ref> with parity group declustering [7] that stores data organized as parity groups of size G distributed on D A different disks (G 1 data blocks and 1 parity block; G D A ).
