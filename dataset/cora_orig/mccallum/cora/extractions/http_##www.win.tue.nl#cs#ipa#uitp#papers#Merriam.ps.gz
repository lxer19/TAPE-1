Title: Making Design Decisions to Support Diversity in Interactive Theorem Proving  
Author: Nicholas A. Merriam Michael D. Harrison 
Address: York, YO10 5DD, U.K.  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, University of York  
Abstract: We present a view of interactive theorem proving as a collection of diverse activities which impact on one another. We catalogue a number of features of existing theorem proving assistants (TPAs) and connect them with the activities which they seem to support. We then volunteer approaches to evaluating these features respecting the connectedness of the activities they support, and begin to make explicit some questions which could be passed on to psychologists, taking the perspective of a designer attempting to construct a powerful and well integrated interface for a TPA.

Reference-contexts: The retrieval of theorems can be awkward, to the point that simple theorems might be proved from scratch rather than located within the existing corpus, see <ref> [AGMT95] </ref>. In general information retrieval is the subject of considerable current research effort and it is beyond the scope of this paper to properly explore that field.
