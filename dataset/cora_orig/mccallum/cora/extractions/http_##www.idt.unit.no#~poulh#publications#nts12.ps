Title: 1 COMPARISON OF SPEED-UP TECHNIQUES FOR SIMULATION  
Author: Poul E. Heegaard,

Abstract: Due to increased complexity and extreme quality of service requirements, traditional means for performance evaluation of telecom networks do not always suffice. The most exible approach has been, and still is, simulation, which is the main focus of this paper. However, severe problems regarding efficiency exist, e.g. evaluation of ATM cell loss rate in range of &lt;10 -9 which is very computer intensive and hardly feasible within reasonable time with direct simulation. This calls for new and more efficient simulation techniques. A short overview of some speed-up approaches is given. This paper compare three of the most promising techniques within the rare event provoking approach; importance sampling, RESTART and transition splitting. They have all demonstrated significant speed-ups over direct simulation. An experiment is carried out by the three techniques on the same system example, and the comparison measure takes into account both the variability in the estimates and the CPU time consumption.

Reference-contexts: This requires that the system (or at least a prototype) exists, which is a considerable cost and may put strong limitations on the exibility of setting up the experiment. However, in a controlled laboratory environment the exibility is larger, e.g., at Telenor R&D they have measurement equipment <ref> [1] </ref> for generation and measurement of ATM traffic [2]. It is well known that to validate figures in the range 10 -9 10 -11 , extremely long measurement or simulation periods are required. Hence, the rare-events represent a serious problem for the dimensioning and QoS.

In fact, direct simulation is not applicable and it is necessary to invest in an accelerated simulation technique. From the results it seems obvious that transition splitting (TS) should be chosen because it outranks both RESTART and importance sampling (IS).

Reference-contexts: If this probability is very small, it causes problems in evaluation by direct simulation. A model of the M/M/1/N queueing system can be illustrated by a Markov state diagram, see Figure 2. A state is the current number of customers in the system. Using regenerative simulation <ref> [13] </ref>, state 0 is the regenerative state. A regenerative cycle is the sequence of events (arrivals and service completions) between two visits to the regenerative state, also called sample path or trajectory.
