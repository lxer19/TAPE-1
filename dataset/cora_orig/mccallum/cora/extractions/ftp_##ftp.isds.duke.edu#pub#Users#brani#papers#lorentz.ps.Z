Abstract: DRAFT WAVELET TRANSFORMATIONS AS DIVERSITY ENHANCERS 1 By Prem Goel Ohio State University and Duke University and Brani Vidakovic Duke University Discrete wavelet transformations have became indispensable analytical tools in data compression and data denoising. In this paper we give some empirical accounts of wavelet transformations and propose novel thresholding and wavelet selection methods. This is achieved via connections with measures of inequality, that have been used in economics for a long time. We compare our methods with standard thresholding and wavelet selection procedures. Key words and phrases: Wavelets, Schur Ordering, Denoising. AMS Subject Classification: 62F05, 62F15. 1 Introduction Discrete orthogonal wavelet transformations have became indispensable analytical tools in data compression and data denoising. As a mater of fact, data compression and denoising are achieved simultaneously with wavelets. Let y ~ be a data vector of dimension (size) n. Assume that n is an integer degree of 2. Suppose that the vector y ~ is wavelet-transformed to a vector d ~ ; i.e. d ~ = W y ~ : The transformation is linear and orthogonal and can be described by an orthogonal matrix W of dimension n fi n. Wavelet shrinkage in statistics was introduced and explored in a sequence of papers by Donoho and Johnstone (ftp.playfair.stanford.edu). See also Nason (1994) and Vi-dakovic (1994b) for different approaches. The simplest wavelet shrinkage technique is so-called hard thresholding. The coordinates of d ~ are replaced by 0 if they are smaller in absolute value than a fixed threshold : 1 Research of the second author supported by NSF Grant DMS-9404151 at Duke University.

Reference-contexts: The following table gives Schur numbers for some choices of parameters ff and fi, and for some wavelet bases. A standard (Devroye, 1986) way to generate D ~ EPD (ff; fi) is D = ffUV 1=fi ; (5) where U is an uniform U <ref> [1; 1] </ref> random variable and V is a Gamma (1 + 1=fi; 1) ran dom variable, independent of U. Example 8 shows that "ordinary" wavelet decomposition coefficients are suitable for the thresholding. Example 8.

Reference-contexts: Example 3. It is interesting to compare the Lorentz curves of the energy distributions in the wavelet setup. To form an exemplary data set (signal) we started with the function y = sin (2x + x 2 ) evaluated at 1024 equally spaced points on <ref> [2; 2] </ref>: Next, the signal was contaminated by an i.i.d. normal N (0; (0:15) 2 ) random noise, and the resulting vector was denoted by y ~ wavelet transform of y ~ was obtained by applying the DAUB6 wavelet, i.e. d ~ ~ ~ and its DAUB6 transformation, d ~ It

Reference-contexts: Analytical results are intractable here (the Lorentz curve for the energy of the model (4)). We performed simulations as well as investigations of fits for real-life turbulence data. Example 7. For 4096 equally spaced points in <ref> [3; 3] </ref>, the values of the the function y = sin (x) + x cos (2x) are evaluated. This data set is contaminated with random noise. We formed three noisy data sets by adding a normal N (0; 0:5 2 ), uniform U (0; 1; ) and t 5 noise.
