Title: Biased Random Walks, Lyapunov Functions, and Stochastic Analysis of Best Fit Bin Packing (Preliminary Version)  
Author: Claire Kenyon Yuval Rabani Alistair Sinclair 
Abstract: We study the average case performance of the Best Fit algorithm for on-line bin packing under the distribution Ufj; kg, in which the item sizes are uniformly distributed in the discrete range f1=k; 2=k; : : :; j=kg. Our main result is that, in the case j = k 2, the expected waste for an infinite stream of items remains bounded. This settles an open problem posed recently by Coffman et al [4]. It is also the first result which involves a detailed analysis of the infinite multi-dimensional Markov chain underlying the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: This adversary model corresponds to a worst case assumption on the effect of other coordinates, and we believe it to be of independent interest. It is similar in flavor to, but differs essentially from, the biased random walk model considered by Azar et al <ref> [1] </ref> in a different context. The model in [1] is allowed to bias the transition probabilities slightly on every step, whereas our adversary may intervene overwhelmingly but only on a limited number of steps. <p> It is similar in flavor to, but differs essentially from, the biased random walk model considered by Azar et al <ref> [1] </ref> in a different context.

The expected waste is also easily seen to be bounded when j 2 for all k &gt; 3. Nonetheless, there is much experimental evidence to suggest that the behavior of Best Fit for various pairs (j; k) is complex and interesting.
