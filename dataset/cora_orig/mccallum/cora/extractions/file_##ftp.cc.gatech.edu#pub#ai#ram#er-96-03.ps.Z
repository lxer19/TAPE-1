Abstract: We believe that identifying media by their cognitive roles (e.g., definition, explanation, pseudo-code, visualization) can improve comprehension and usability in hypermedia systems designed for learning. We refer to media links organ ized around their cognitive role as cognitive media types [Recker, Ram, Shikano, Li, & Stasko, 1995] . Our hypothesis is that the goals that students bring to the learning task will affect how they will use the hypermedia support system [Ram & Leake, 1995] . We explored student use of a hypermedia system based on cognitive media types where students performed different orienting tasks: undirected, browsing in order to answer specific questions, problemsolving, and problemsolving with prompted self-explanations. We found significant differences in use behavior between problemsolving and browsing students, though no learning differences.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Hypermedia is typically oriented around physical media types, for instance, text, video, graphics, and audio. The World Wide Webs use of Mime types, which are based on physical characteristics, is a good example <ref> [Berners-Lee, Cailliau, Luotonen, Nielsen, & Secret, 1994] </ref>. We believe that identifying media by their cognitive roles (e.g., definition, explanation, pseudo-code, visualization) can improve comprehension and usability in hypermedia systems designed for learning. We refer to media links organized around their cognitive role as cognitive media types.

Reference-contexts: We hypothesized that we might be able to prompt students to self-explain based on their activity in the hypermedia system to achieve gains in learning. Our efforts here are similar to those of <ref> [Bielaczyc, Pirolli, & Brown, 1991] </ref> [Bielaczyc & Recker, 1991] who also engineered prompts to encourage and teach self-explanation behavior. Our additional question was whether students prompted for self-explanations would access the cognitive media types differently than students without such prompts.

Reference-contexts: Self-explanations: The work of Chi and others <ref> [Chi, 1992] </ref> [Chi, Bassok, Lewis, Reimman, & Glaser, 1990] suggests that students who self-explain the content and their actions learn more effectively than those who do not self-explain.

Reference-contexts: Certainly, the system can be tuned to different tasks. Researchers working on the Superbook hypermedia system found that different interfaces better supported either browsing activity or searching for a particular kind of information <ref> [Egan, Remde, Gomez, Landauer, Eberhardt, et al., 1990] </ref>. Our question was whether setting different tasks for students (and thus, different goals) would affect (a) how students utilized cognitive media types and (b) student learning.

Reference-contexts: In fact, some researchers have even claimed that reading will become an obsolete skill as multimedia computers become more common <ref> [Papert, 1993] </ref>. While the case and value of glitz is real and important, our data suggest that if users are actively trying to problemsolve and use the content in a hypermedia system, they will invest the time on the content, perhaps even reading the text.

Reference-contexts: Since the problemsolving students spend more time studying content but view less of the overall system, good navigation mechanisms that lead these students to the necessary content will be a critical feature of future systems <ref> [Shippey, Ram, Albrecht, Roberts, Guzdial, et al., 1996] </ref>. Time spent on the content suggests an interesting avenue for an exploration where the relative amounts of different cognitive media types are varied to investigate further the relationship between media types, task, and learning.
