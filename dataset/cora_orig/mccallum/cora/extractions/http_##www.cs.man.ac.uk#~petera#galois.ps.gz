Abstract: This is intended to be a large scale, ambitious and perhaps collaborative project to develop a significant body of machine checked mathematics. The primary aim of the project is to produce enough algebra to cover Galois Theory and some of its applications, such as the unsolvability of the general polynomial of any degree greater than four. In order to develop Galois Theory it will be necessary to define and develop, to some extent, several algebraic theories and then use combinations of the theories to create Galois Theory itself. In particular there will need to be chapters on Group Theory, Linear Algebra, Polynomial Rings, Field Extensions, etc. One advantage in choosing Galois Theory is that there is a significant amount of algorithmic work to be done in applications of the theory, and it would be interesting to explore the possibilities of combining this theory and proof development work with the use of computer algebra systems. 1 A reason to choose an ambitious project is so as to try to confront some of the issues of large scale: documentation and collaboration. We do not expect to be able to complete the project in just a few months on our own. Nevertheless I feel that even partial work on the project is worthwhile. This project has only been under way for 2-3 months so that we have only had time to make a limited amount of progress. Gilles Barthe, an RA working on the Types project in Manchester since October, has had no previous practical experience with any proof development system. We decided to use Lego for the present, as this is the system I am reasonably familiar with. Rather than plunge into Galois Theory right away, Gilles has
