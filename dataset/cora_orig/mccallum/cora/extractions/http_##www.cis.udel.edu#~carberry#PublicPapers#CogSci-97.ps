Abstract: This paper presents a message planner, TraumaGEN, that draws on rhetorical structure and discourse theory to address the problem of producing integrated messages from individual critiques, each of which is designed to achieve its own communicative goal. TraumaGEN takes into account the purpose of the messages, the situation in which the messages will be received, and the social role of the system.

Reference-contexts: We note that this problem is likely to arise elsewhere as sophisticated systems distribute their processing across individual modules, each of which may need to communicate with the user. Although natural language has been used in other health care systems such as MIGRAINE (Buchanan et al., 1995) and Piglet <ref> (Binsted, Cawsey, and Jones, 1995) </ref>, their applications have not required that they combine several independent but inter-related text plans into a single integrated message.

Reference-contexts: First, Trauma-GEN's eventual message must achieve several top-level communicative goals as a unit. This differs from traditional text planners that must satisfy a single rhetorical goal such as relating the temporal sequence of events in which a particular ship is a part <ref> (Hovy, 1991) </ref> or achieve a single intentional goal such as getting the user to make a particular change in a Lisp program (Moore and Paris, 1993).

Reference-contexts: Trailing Comments When several critiques are merged into a single message, the message may refer to actions that are also part of critiques that did not participate in the merge. Once these actions have been introduced in the merged message, discourse theory, particularly work on focusing heuristics <ref> (McKeown, 1985) </ref>, suggest that the other critiques referencing these actions be included in the merged message as well. However, rather than restructure the result of our merge transformation, we append them to the end of the message. Thus we refer to them as trailing comments.

In such cases, the text planner can construct a plan top-down from the single goal and include those propositions that fit into a coherent piece of text and contribute to achieving the top-level goal.

Reference-contexts: Rhetorical structure theory <ref> (Mann and Thompson, 1987) </ref> posits that a coherent text plan consists of segments related to one another by rhetorical relations such as motivation or background. To address the problem of informational overlap, we found that it was necessary to draw on the multi-nuclear Sequence relation of RST.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents our implemented system, TraumaGEN, that addresses this problem. It describes the strategies that we have adopted to produce coherent integrated messages and discusses how our system takes into account factors such as the social role of the system.

Reference-contexts: Although Wolz (1990) developed a system for generating text satisfying dual, but related, discourse goals such as responding and enriching, her system focused on eliminating obvious or redundant information, not on producing integrated messages from individual, possibly conflicting, critiques. Similarly, the WISHFUL system <ref> (Zukerman and McConachy, 1995) </ref> includes an optimization stage during which it chooses the optimal way to achieve a set of related communicative goals; however, the system can choose to eliminate propositions and it does not have to deal with conflict within the information to be conveyed.
