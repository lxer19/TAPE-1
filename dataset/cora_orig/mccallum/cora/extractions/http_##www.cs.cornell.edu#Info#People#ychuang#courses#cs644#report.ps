Abstract: fl View synthesis is an important topic in both computer vision and computer graphics. Since it is hard to extract 3D model in real world images, and do the needed synthesis, a better method is worth being developed. Steven M. Seitz and Charles R. Dyer came up with a conclusion that under generic assumptions about visibility and projection process, 2D image interpolation of two rectified images can generate valid in-between image [?]. In this project, we implement the view synthesis procedure based on the concepts described in their paper. It was found that the images generated usually could keep the main structures of the scenes. Sometimes, with high quality original images, they can give really compelling visual effects.
