Abstract: A brief survey of biological research on non-coding DNA is presented here. There has been growing interest in the effects of non-coding segments in evolutionary algorithms (EAs). To better understand and conduct research on non-coding segments and EAs, it is important to understand the biological background of such work. This paper begins with a review of basic genetics and terminology, describes the different types of non-coding DNA, and then surveys recent intron research.

Reference-contexts: In-trons are only found in eukaryotic genomes and make up a large portion of the DNA in eukaryotic genomes. In humans, for example, approximately 30% of the human genome is made up of introns <ref> [1] </ref>. Only about 3% consists of coding DNA and the rest of the genome consists of other non-coding DNA, repetitive sequences, and regulatory regions.

Reference-contexts: Introns are removed from RNA by a process called RNA splicing which occurs in the nucleus of a cell [22] [31] [32]. There are many different methods of RNA splicing [22] <ref> [3] </ref> [7]. Most of the splicing processes require the aid of proteins. Proteins recognize specific sequences in the pre-RNA to catalyze the splicing process. The majority of introns in this group follow the GT-AG rule: the intron begins with the dinucleotide GT and ends with the dinucleotide AG. <p> In addition, from known exon sizes and intron positions, it has been possible to predict the positions of introns that have been lost from one species but may still exist in another [14] [16]. The introns-late theory suggests that introns developed in the eukaryotic evolutionary process. <ref> [3] </ref> [33] [7]. Since prokaryotes have traditionally been considered more primitive than eukaryotes, the even-more-primitive genome of the common ancestor of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is often assumed to resemble the tightly organized prokaryotic genome. <p> A study of the different classes of introns showed that the relationship between the classes is related to the phylogenetic organization of the organisms in which they appear <ref> [3] </ref>. This suggests that introns arose and evolved in eukaryotic genomes. It has been speculated that introns could have arisen from gene duplication, transposable elements, or self insertion [22] [33]. 5 Summary EAs have successfully incorporated many ideas from biological systems into computational search algorithms, including that of non-coding material.

Reference-contexts: Non-coding DNA: intragenic regions and introns. ribosome attaches each new amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain. When the end of the mRNA chain is reached, the ribosome separates from the mRNA and releases a complete polypeptide chain. <ref> [4] </ref> [22] [35] [36]. 3 Non-coding DNA The term non-coding DNA refers to all DNA that is not involved in the coding of a mature RNA product. Though non-coding DNA is prevalent in biological systems, its origin and function are as yet uncertain.

To accommodate their short reproductive and life cycles, prokaryotes subsequently lost the introns from their genomes due to selection for increased efficiency in gene expression and for a reduction in genome size.

Reference-contexts: In genetic programming (GP) systems, non-coding material is a natural by-product of the evolutionary process [19] [26] [29] [30] [28]. In genetic algorithm (GA) systems, studies have included both manually inserted non-coding segments and evolved segments <ref> [8] </ref> [17] [21] [23] [38] [39] [37]. Both theoretical and empirical studies suggest that non-coding segments may encourage the recombination of and discourage the destruction of existing building blocks in EAs. Evidence indicates that non-coding segments have a stabilizing effect, improving the EA's ability to preserve good building blocks.

This process would certainly be more efficient than building new genes one nucleotide at a time.

Reference-contexts: Accordingly, we currently find much less complexity and variation in prokaryotes than in eukaryotes. Research on the gene for the protein triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) has pushed the known existence of the intron structure back before the divergence of plants and animals [25] [15] <ref> [14] </ref>. TPI is an extremely old protein whose gene sequence is relatively conserved across all organisms.

Reference-contexts: Building or modifying proteins from such sub-units is expected to be easier and faster than building proteins one nucleotide at a time. The discovery and exchange of building blocks or partial solutions is one of the unique aspects of evolutionary search algorithms. According to the building block hypothesis <ref> [20] </ref> such algorithms are expected to search for multiple building blocks in parallel and recursively combine these building blocks to form a complete solution. Secondly, both introns and non-coding segments are thought to increase the rate of recombination during evolution.

In genetic algorithm (GA) systems, studies have included both manually inserted non-coding segments and evolved segments [8] [17] [21] [23] [38] [39] [37]. Both theoretical and empirical studies suggest that non-coding segments may encourage the recombination of and discourage the destruction of existing building blocks in EAs.

Reference-contexts: Simply put, non-coding segments refer to the portions of an individual that make no contribution to its fitness value.

Reference-contexts: Introns are removed from RNA by a process called RNA splicing which occurs in the nucleus of a cell [22] <ref> [31] </ref> [32]. There are many different methods of RNA splicing [22] [3] [7]. Most of the splicing processes require the aid of proteins. Proteins recognize specific sequences in the pre-RNA to catalyze the splicing process.

Reference-contexts: In addition, from known exon sizes and intron positions, it has been possible to predict the positions of introns that have been lost from one species but may still exist in another [14] [16]. The introns-late theory suggests that introns developed in the eukaryotic evolutionary process. [3] <ref> [33] </ref> [7]. Since prokaryotes have traditionally been considered more primitive than eukaryotes, the even-more-primitive genome of the common ancestor of prokaryotes and eukaryotes is often assumed to resemble the tightly organized prokaryotic genome. <p> This suggests that introns arose and evolved in eukaryotic genomes. It has been speculated that introns could have arisen from gene duplication, transposable elements, or self insertion [22] <ref> [33] </ref>. 5 Summary EAs have successfully incorporated many ideas from biological systems into computational search algorithms, including that of non-coding material. This paper reviews the basics of genetics and surveys recent research on biological non-coding DNA.

Reference-contexts: Proponents of a late insertional origin of introns argue that the data supporting the exon theory of genes is intermittent and thus not solid enough to favor an early origin of introns <ref> [34] </ref>. There is a growing interest in the different classes of introns and the appearance and distribution of these classes in the genomes of organisms.

Reference-contexts: RNA carries out the synthesis of proteins from the DNA instructions. A gene is a segment of DNA that codes for an RNA product. The different Fig. 2. During transcription, one strand of DNA of a gene is copied into RNA. This figure was adapted from figure 13.3 of <ref> [35] </ref>. Fig. 3. A gene is bound by initiation and terminator sites. values of a gene are called alleles. The synthesis of proteins from DNA occurs in two steps: transcription and translation. During transcription, the DNA of a gene is copied into RNA (see figure 2). <p> Non-coding DNA: intragenic regions and introns. ribosome attaches each new amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain. When the end of the mRNA chain is reached, the ribosome separates from the mRNA and releases a complete polypeptide chain.

Though non-coding DNA is prevalent in biological systems, its origin and function are as yet uncertain.
