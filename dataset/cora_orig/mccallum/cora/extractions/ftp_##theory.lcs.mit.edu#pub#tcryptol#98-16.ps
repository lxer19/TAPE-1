Abstract: Quantum cryptography has long been claimed to be useful for achieving many tasks that are impossible from the perspective of conventional cryptography. Arguably, the most important problem in quantum cryptography has been a rigorous proof of the security of quantum key distribution, the most well-known application. This notoriously hard problem has eluded researchers for years and has become even more important after the recent surprising demonstration of the insecurity of many other quantum cryptographic schemes including quantum bit commitment. Here, we solve this long standing problem by showing that, given quantum computers, quantum key distribution over an arbitrarily long distance of a realistic noisy channel can be made unconditionally secure. The novel technique we use is reduction from a quantum scheme to a classical scheme. The security in realistic noisy environments is then proven by using the recent theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation.

Reference-contexts: Much work has been done on the security of QKD [11-15]. Early studies were restricted to simple attacks such as the intercept-resend attacks and individual particle attacks. More recently, the security of QKD against a restricted class of joint attacks | the so-called collective attacks | has been discussed <ref> [12] </ref>. There are also claims of proofs of ultimate security of QKD [16-18], but there has been no consensus in the scientific community regarding the validity of those proofs.

Reference-contexts: The problem has become more 2 acute after the recent surprising demonstration of the insecurity of many other quantum cryptographic schemes such as quantum bit commitment [19-22] and quantum one-out-of-two oblivious transfer <ref> [23] </ref>. Therefore, it is important for us to settle the basic and provocative question: Is quantum key distribution really secure? 3. Difficulty of the Problem We remark that a proof of security of QKD is a very hard problem.

Reference-contexts: The above statement is valid for any eavesdropping strategy that passes the test with a non-negligible probability. (Of course, strategies that pass the test with negligible probabilities are uninteresting.) Moreover, using the random hashing technique devised by Bennett et al. <ref> [24] </ref>, we show that the fidelity can be made to be exponentially close to 1, i.e., 1 O (e cm ) for some c &gt; 0. Therefore, upon passing the test, Alice and Bob can confidently use the remaining pairs to generate a shared key. <p> Consequently, if the N pairs are indeed singlets, they will always pass the above verification test. What about a general state? A non-singlet has only a probability 1=3 of passing the test. Let us consider the above three possible types of measurements more carefully. (See Ref. <ref> [24] </ref> for details.) Measurements along the x-axis will give an anti-parallel result for the pair if its initial state is in the two-dimensional subspace spanned by and . They give a parallel result for the two-dimensional subspace spanned by the other two states + and + . <p> Since any mixed state can be represented by a pure state by including the quantum die explicitly, we shall, without loss of generality, consider that Eve prepares a pure state only. Using the convention of Ref. <ref> [24] </ref>, two classical bits are used to label each of the Bell states. + = 00 = 0 = 10 = 2 Eve prepares a pure state 8 jui = i 1 ;i 2 ;;i N j where i j denotes the state of the j-th pair and it runs from <p> Now once we have shown that the entropy of the remaining pair (s) is small, no local measurements on `the rest' can possibly increase this entropy <ref> [24] </ref>. More importantly, by Kholevo's theorem [33] this entropy provides an upper bound on the amount of classical mutual information between the remaining pair (s) and `the rest'. Since Eve's system is only part of `the rest', this entropy provides a rigorous bound on her information about the generated key. <p> IV. RANDOM HASHING For simplicity, in our above discussion we have only introduced a simple verification scheme. In actual applications, we suggest employing a verification scheme based on random hashing proposed by Bennett et al. <ref> [24] </ref>. This scheme requires only a very number of tested pairs to achieve exponential security and is, thus, much more efficient than the simple 11 scheme that we have discussed. This random hashing scheme requires non-trivial quantum computations on the pairs before the actual verification. <p> APPENDIX B: SECURITY OF A QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION SCHEME BASED ON RANDOM HASHING Here we shall discuss a more efficient quantum verification scheme. It is based on a one-way hashing scheme for entanglement purification developed by Bennett et al. <ref> [24] </ref>. In Ref. [24], a Bell state is represented by two classical bit (see Eq. (2)). A 2N -bit string x 0 forms a basis for the state of the N pairs. The parity of a string is a modulo-2 sum of its bits. <p> APPENDIX B: SECURITY OF A QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION SCHEME BASED ON RANDOM HASHING Here we shall discuss a more efficient quantum verification scheme. It is based on a one-way hashing scheme for entanglement purification developed by Bennett et al. <ref> [24] </ref>. In Ref. [24], a Bell state is represented by two classical bit (see Eq. (2)). A 2N -bit string x 0 forms a basis for the state of the N pairs. The parity of a string is a modulo-2 sum of its bits. <p> In the most general eavesdropping strategy, the state of the N pairs and Eve's ancilla can be written as an entangled state of the two subsystems. The important observation made by Bennett et al. <ref> [24] </ref> is that, by applying local operations (which include BXOR bilateral =2 rotations and unilateral Pauli rotations), followed by local measurement of one of the pairs, one can measure the parity of an arbitrary chosen subset s of the unknown x. <p> Similarly, in the second round, x 1 is mapped into a (2N 4)-bit string x 2 = f s 1 (x 1 ). Given any two initial strings x 0 and y 0 , it is then shown in <ref> [24] </ref> that the probability that the remaining 16 strings are different and yet the random parities computed in the first m rounds are the same, i.e.

Reference-contexts: In what follows, we will argue that the general theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation (and quantum error correction) can be used to overcome all sources of errors. A general theory of fault-tolerant quantum computation [29-32] has been developed. For a review, see, for example, Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>. <p> Eq. (36) of Ref. <ref> [28] </ref> says that, roughly speaking, if the threshold gate error rate is * 0 , and the actual elementary gate error rate is * &lt; * 0 , then concatenating the code L times will reduce the error rate to * (L) ~ * 0 * 0 . <p> However, as discussed by Briegel et al. [37], Alice and Bob can still overcome the channel noises by the following method: They can divide up the transmission process by setting up intermediate connection points (or relay stations). In those connection points, yy See, for example, section 3.5 of Ref. <ref> [28] </ref> for a discussion on the encoding process. Notice that, for many block coding schemes, the decoding process is just the inverse of the encoding process. Therefore, it can be done with a similar fidelity. 21 they are now allowed to perform quantum computations. "..
