Abstract: RoboSoccer is a multi-agent framework in which multiple robots collaborate in an adversarial environment. RoboSoccer can be built with robots and fields of different sizes. In the smallest version of the game, robots cannot incorporate on-board full autonomous capabilities. In particular, vision processing is off-board, centralized, and connected to the individual clients that control the robots. The vision system needs to overview the complete field and to compute in real time positioning information for the moving ball and players. This paper describes our on-going work on developing a multi-object tracking and prediction in this challenging setup. This paper presents our preliminary work applying an extended Kalman filter to follow the trajectory of multiple moving colored objects. We present empirical results that show the effectiveness of the method both in position tracking and prediction. We conclude with a discussion of the approach, results and future work.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Robotic Soccer has recently been introduced as a testbed for multiagent AI research, where teamplay-ers must interact and coordinate with each other to compete against a team of opponents <ref> (Kitano et al. 1997) </ref>. Both simulator-based and real robot competitions have been set. We have pursued research on both tracks, developing layered learning approaches within the simulator (Stone & Veloso 1997) and constructing real robots (Veloso, Stone, & Achim 1997).

Reference-contexts: This operation has the advantage that it is simple and fast to compute. We are interested in near frame-rate acquisition frequencies. In order to achieve extremely fast perception, dedicated hardwares are often employed to speed up processing <ref> (Sohota et al. 1995) </ref>. We use a Cognachrome Vision System developed at Newton Labs which can perform color segmentation and blob orientation finding at a peak rate of 30 frame/sec. The Cognachrome system can track objects of three different types of color.

In this paper, we focus on our work building a reliable system of real robots for robotic soccer. The nature of the game requires good players to have fast perception, fast planning, fast action, accurate control and cooperation. <p> This brings together techniques from different fields such as vision, learning, planning, robotics control and multiagent systems. Modules which deal with each of the these issues have been or are being designed and implemented to achieve our overall goal <ref> (Veloso, Stone, & Achim 1997) </ref>. This paper concentrates on the perception aspects of our research. Concretely we design a vision algorithm that uses an extended Kalman filter to track and predict the position of the moving robots and ball. <p> An overhead camera with a global view of the field is usually used. The output of the camera is fed into the off-board computer (s) and then the vision input is processed. The off-board computer (s) communicate with the robots wireless and send strategic navigational control commands <ref> (Veloso, Stone, & Achim 1997) </ref>. Special color markings are allowed on the robot to differentiate between team members and opponents. The soccer ball used in these competition is an orange-colored golf ball.
