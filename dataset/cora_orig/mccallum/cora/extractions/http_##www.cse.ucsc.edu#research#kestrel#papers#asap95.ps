Abstract: Sequence comparison, a vital research tool in computational biology, is based on a simple O(n 2 ) algorithm that easily maps to a linear array of processors. This paper reviews and compares high-performance sequence analysis on general-purpose supercomputers and single-purpose, reconfigurable, and programmable co-processors. The difficulty of comparing hardware from published performance figures is also noted.

Reference-contexts: Biologists also often want to know the alignment of two sequences, an operation that can require storing the dynamic programming matrix and tracing backward the path of minimizations. BLAST, a heuristic with simple dynamic programming, is popular on serial computers because of its speed <ref> [1] </ref>. High-performance sequence analysis relies on straightforward parallelization of the O (n 2 ) dynamic programming. A common mapping is to assign one processing element (PE) to each character of the query string, and then to either shift the database through the linear chain of PEs (Figure 1).

Following the flavor of the classic "12 ways to fool the masses" <ref> [2] </ref>, here are six of the original (with original numbers but modified to this domain) that came up in this study several times. 1.

Reference-contexts: All architectures have strengths and weaknesses for sequence comparison and alignment and other applications. Supercomputers, where affordable, provide good performance coupled with applicability to a wealth of problems. For less expensive and faster solutions, suitable for repetitious use as network servers or HMM <ref> [11] </ref> trainers, specialized co-processors are an excellent solution. The reconfigurable, bit-oriented mesh designs are appropriate for sequence analysis, but are perhaps better suited to image processing and other applica 3 tions. Single-purpose hardware can be incredibly fast but is restricted to a single algorithm.

Reference-contexts: In the Kestrel system, multiple characters are packed in each PE's local RAM with no additional overhead to the cell program length. In the SP machines, the computation must be externally partitioned into array-length segments, with values recycled from one partition to the next <ref> [12] </ref>. This overhead is estimated at one extra cycle per cell program. Two observations can be made. First, PE density is critical, and something not achieved in RH systems (even for 4-character edit distance) or BISP. BISP's early lead in Figure 2 is quickly overcome by systems with more PEs.
