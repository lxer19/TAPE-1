Reference-contexts: The main objective of our study is to estimate values analytically for the parameters involved in two recently proposed and analyzed IR methods. Namely we consider an averaging scheme [13,16,17] (denoted by AVE in the sequel) and a Robin-type IR scheme <ref> [8] </ref> (denoted by ROB). We restrict ourselves to Helmholtz boundary value problems. In both schemes the error involved in each interface can be analytically given in terms of the error in the previous iteration. <p> fi x=x p L i u i = f i in i du (k+1) dx fi fi + i1 u i fi x=x i1 i1 i fi fi x=x i (k+1) fi fi = g i 9 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ; 3 This scheme, first proposed in <ref> [8] </ref>, is based on a simple relaxation technique that involves the Robin interface conditions shown above. The DE problem is solved in each subdomain where the boundary conditions are provided from the previously computed solution and its normal derivative from the adjacent subdomains. <p> The relaxation parameter i controls the influence of the value of the function and/or its normal derivative on the smoothing Robin interface conditions. This method was first analyzed in <ref> [8] </ref> where, through energy estimates, the convergence of the method at differential level has been established for arbitrary decompositions and elliptic operators. Later in [2,6] this method was been further analyzed at discrete level in a finite element framework. Several variations of this method have been also appeared.

Reference-contexts: Preprint submitted to Elsevier Science 3 August 1998 from one subdomain to another; we do not consider this application here. For a general introduction to the IR methodology the reader is refereed to [9,10]. A review study of a large collection of IR methods can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. The convergence of these schemae depends, as expected, on the differential operator, the geometry of the original domain, and in addition on the geometry of the subdomains chosen. This makes the selection of "optimum" values for the relaxation parameters a hard and challenging problem.

Reference-contexts: The development of an automated and adaptive procedure that dynamically estimates "good" relaxation parameters, using automatic differentiation techniques, for general differential operators and arbitrarily shaped subdomains is underway <ref> [12] </ref>. Nevertheless, in order for this parameter selection procedure to be effective, theoretical results for simple model problems are needed that provide a better understanding of the convergence mechanisms involved.

A simple model problem with a two subdomain decomposition is considered in <ref> [13] </ref> where Fourier analysis at the differential level is used to obtain "good" values for the interface relaxation parameter 1 while set equal to 1=2. It is worth pointing out the inherent parallelism in both the 2 is algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Similarly in Table 2 we consider the AVE method and set fl = 10. The rapid rate of convergence is easily observed as one moves down along any column. Note that this convergence is not immediate (1 iteration) as our theory might indicate. It can be shown <ref> [15] </ref> that this is mainly due to the particular block structure of the Jordan form of the iteration matrices but a formal analysis of this is beyond the scope for this paper.

Reference-contexts: Using these estimates of the normal derivatives, the Neumann problem is solved in the second step (even terms) for all subdomains. There are already several theoretical results concerning the above method which we briefly list below. In <ref> [17] </ref>, two finite element approaches (a Galerkin and a hybrid mixed) have been employed to analyze the convergence of the method at a discrete level setting both relaxation parameters equal to 1=2. A convergence analysis of the method at the differential level using Hilbert space techniques is given in [16].

Reference-contexts: A second variation of ROB method that extends its applicability and frees it from the cross-point trouble is formulated and analyzed in [1].

In some of these studies optimal values for the relaxation parameters have been obtained but only for model problems and only assuming a discrete formulation of the method (i.e., first discretize and then decompose the linear algebra problem).
