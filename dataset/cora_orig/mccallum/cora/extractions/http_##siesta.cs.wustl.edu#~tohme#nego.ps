Title: NEGOTIATION AS A RESOURCE ALLOCATION PROCESS  
Author: Fernando Tohme 
Note: Preliminary Version  
Address: in St.Louis  Nac. del Sur Argentina  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department Washington University  Departamento de Economa Univ.  
Abstract: The main economic-theoretic approaches to the problem of resource allocation make little if any reference to negotiation processes. These processes are fundamentally linguistic, based on the exchange of messages among agents.Being communication so fundamental in the characterization of negotiation processes, their analysis must emphasize on the structure of the language in which the negotiations take place. Computer Science and particulary Artificial Intelligence have provided interesting insights about that structure. In the first part of this work we present a brief survey of the literature on resource allocation processes in which communication among agents plays a relevant role. Then, taken into account the results of AI research, we present a model of negotiation with a strong emphasis on the underlying linguistic structure. We use the properties of that structure to derive the conditions that message exchanges must obey in order to provide Pareto-optimal allocations. fl I gratefully aknowledge the financial support of the National Research Council of Ar-gentina (CONICET) and the hospitality of the Computer Science Department in WashU.

This is consistent with the point of view of the adherents to the doctrine of procedural rationality <ref> [March 86] </ref>. This point of view emphasizes on the properties of economic processes instead of on the economic outcomes.

Reference-contexts: The importance of the Edgeworthian approach relies on its relations with other theoretical models in which conflict and cooperation are deeply intertwined. Only to give an example, it has been noted that economic development seems to arise with institutional arrangements regulating property rights among individuals in a society <ref> [North 86] </ref>. The birth of these institutions is due to processes of communication among agents trading intangible commodities like political support or legal entitlements. This generalization falls short of a more general view of negotiation processes as resource allocators.

Reference-contexts: This generalization falls short of a more general view of negotiation processes as resource allocators. The reason for that is that solutions to bargaing problems do not illuminate the linguistic and computational features of these processes. Only behavioral economics has in a certain sense highlighted these aspects <ref> [Simon 82] </ref>. On the other hand, Computer Science and particulary Artificial Intelligence as a quite autonomous discipline that studies representations of intentional agents shows the way to determining interactions among them, taken into account their intrinsic linguistic nature and the computational limita 3 tions inherent to these processes.
