Title: Probabilistic Recurrence Relations for Parallel Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms  
Author: Marek Karpinski Wolf Zimmermann 
Date: December, 1991  
Pubnum: TR-91-067  
Abstract: We study two probabilistic recurrence relations that arise frequently in the analysis of parallel and sequential divide-and-conquer algorithms (cf. [Karp 91]). Suppose a problem of size x has to be solved. In order to solve it we divide it into subproblems of size h 1 (x); : : :; h k (x) and these subproblems are solved recursively. We assume that size(h i (z)) are random variables. This occurs if either the break up step is randomized or the instances to be solved are drawn from a probability distribution. The running time T (z) of a parallel algorithm is therefore determined by the maximum of the running times T (h i (z)) of the subproblems while the sequential algorithm is determined by the sum of the running times of the subproblems. We give a method for estimating (tight) upper bounds on the probability distribution of T (x) for these two kinds of recurrence relations, answering the open questions in [Karp 91].

Reference-contexts: to a probabilistic recurrence relation of the form T (z) = a (x) + max (T (h 1 (x)); T (h 2 (x))) + max (T (h 3 (x)); T (h 4 (x))) These kind of recurrences occur for example in the analysis of a convex hull algorithm (cf., e.g. <ref> [Ak 89] </ref>). These recurrences require a combination of Theorems 1 and 5. Acknowledgements. We thank Peter Burgisser, Gerhard Goos, Dick Karp, and Raimund Seidel for a number of interesting discussions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Two classes of probabilistic recurrence relations occur frequently in the analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms cf. <ref> [Ka 91] </ref>. A problem instance z of size x is divided into subproblems h 1 (z); : : : ; h k (z). On a sequential computer the subproblems has to be solved one after another. <p> In this case the running time T (z) is also a random variable, and we estimate bounds on its probability distribution for both cases, (1) and (2). This work is an extension of Karp's results <ref> [Ka 91] </ref> and solves the open questions of [Ka 91]. Throughout the paper we use the following notations and assumptions: * a (z) is a function on the size of z and does not depend on the distribution of z. <p> In this case the running time T (z) is also a random variable, and we estimate bounds on its probability distribution for both cases, (1) and (2). This work is an extension of Karp's results <ref> [Ka 91] </ref> and solves the open questions of [Ka 91]. Throughout the paper we use the following notations and assumptions: * a (z) is a function on the size of z and does not depend on the distribution of z. <p> These weak assumptions make our results practical, because the distribution of (h 1 (x); : : : ; h k (x)) is usually unknown. In section 2 we consider probabilistic recurrences of type (2), and in section 3, probabilistic recurrences of type (1). This paper has similar aims as <ref> [Ka 91] </ref>. Among others, we provide a cook book methodology for analyzing divide-and-conquer algorithms in some general situations. <p> (z)) u (x) + ((log (x) log (m 1 (x) + + m k (x))) a (x)) 1 Proof: Use the formula E [Y ] = R 1 0 Pr [Y y]dy for non-negative random variables Y . 2 The proof of Theorem 1 follows a similar line as in <ref> [Ka 91] </ref>. We shall also use the following Lemma: Lemma 3 (R. Karp [Ka 91]) Let X be a random variable with range [0; x] for some x. <p> k (x))) a (x)) 1 Proof: Use the formula E [Y ] = R 1 0 Pr [Y y]dy for non-negative random variables Y . 2 The proof of Theorem 1 follows a similar line as in <ref> [Ka 91] </ref>. We shall also use the following Lemma: Lemma 3 (R. Karp [Ka 91]) Let X be a random variable with range [0; x] for some x. Let f be a non-negative real-valued integrable function such that there is b &gt; 0 with: * f (x)=x is non-decreasing on [0; b]. * For all y b: f (y) = 1. <p> Define a function d r (x) as follows: d r (x) = &gt; &lt; x a (x) e x 1 otherwise Then s r (z) d r (size (z)). Proof: The outline of this proof is similar to that of Theorem 7 in <ref> [Ka 91] </ref>. The proof is by induction using as hypothesis the claim in 5. In order to prove the induction step, we apply another induction. <p> We assume that k 2. For k = 1 the results of <ref> [Ka 91] </ref> can be applied. This kind of recurrence relations occurs for example in the analysis of sequential divide-and-conquer algorithms. The result has a more complicated form than the previous one although the proof follows almost the same line. <p> These results also enable the extension of the above methods to analyze automatically the expected worst case of randomized algorithms. 5 Summary and Further Research It would be interesting to improve the above results (and the results of <ref> [Ka 91] </ref>) in the case the upper bounds of the higher moments are known. Currently, we are 13 able to give estimates for the probability distribution of the running time of parallel divide-and-conquer algorithms.
