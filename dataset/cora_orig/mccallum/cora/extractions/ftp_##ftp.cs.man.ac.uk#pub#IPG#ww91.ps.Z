Abstract: The initial model will consist of a full description of what actually goes on in the organisation, and what the real objectives of the management and staff are. This initial model will then stand as the basis for the design process, which will lead to the creation of a model for the proposed situation when the PSS system is introduced. This model in turn will consist of two parts: one of the environment in which the PSS system will run, and one of the PSS system itself. The latter will be in a form which permits the code for the system to be generated directly from it. Given that the system will be constantly evolving, it would be useful in small systems, and essential in large ones, always to have an up-to-date model for purposes of implementing and keeping track of changes. Work is continuing under the IOPT program on forms for models. Originally PML was, as its name suggests, intended to be a language in which to model the processes, and its main constructs roles, activities, entities, and interactions - reect this. However, the requirement of executability has led to scripts written in the language being very difficult for humans to understand. PSS attempts to co-ordinate routine co-operative work. In order to do this it embodies a description of those work processes. However, these processes are in essence normative and subject to a process of dialectical development. PSS provides a framework within which systems can be built which tightly prescribe or loosely guide as required, and which can develop and grow. But there is still much work to be done on tools and methodologies to help system designers in the creation of suitable structures.
