Abstract: It is a well known fact that the generalized Vandermonde determinant can be expressed as the product of the standard Vandermonde determinant and a polynomial with nonnegative integer coefficients. In this paper we generalize this result to Vandermonde determinants over the Chebyshev basis. We apply this result to prove that the number of real roots in [1; 1] of a real polynomial is bounded by the number of its nonvanishing coefficients (sparsity) when represented over the Chebyshev basis. This bound on the number of real roots is used to prove finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension (and thereby uniform learnability) of the class of polynomials of bounded sparsity over the Chebyshev basis.

For a fixed set S of cardinality d we may identify the set of all labelings of S with f0; 1g d .

In this section we extend their result to sparse polynomials over the Chebyshev basis.

Reference-contexts: The Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of the class C is the largest (possible infinite) integer d such that some set S X of cardinality d is shattered by C. If the VC dimension of C is finite, C is called a VC class. This notation was introduced by Vapnik and Chervonenkis <ref> [9] </ref> to give sufficient conditions on a class C of events so that the relative frequency of an event in the class converges to its probability. Recently, the VC dimension proved to be useful in the field of uniform and distribution-free learnability.

Reference-contexts: Let pos (y F ) denote the collection of all sets pos (y f) = fx 2 X j y f (x) &gt; 0g for f 2 F . We identify the VC dimension of F with the VC dimension of pos (y F). Wenocur and Dudley <ref> [10] </ref> proved that for vector spaces F of real-valued functions the VC dimension of pos (y F ) coincides with the vector space dimension of F .

Reference-contexts: It is easy to see that P T;a is not homogeneous in general, so we cannot use their ideas in the Chebyshev setting. Instead, we will use an induction on the number of gaps in the index vector a. This approach is used in <ref> [11] </ref> to study the coefficients of the S-representation of P S;a . It turns out that these techniques, which only use the symmetry of P S;a , can be transferred to the Chebyshev basis. However, the proof of Theorem 2 involves a lot of technical details.
