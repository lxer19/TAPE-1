Abstract: Both long and short path delays are used to determine the valid clocking for various CMOS circuits such as single phase latching, asynchronous, and wave pipelining. Therefore, accurate estimation of both long and short path delays is very crucial in the designing and testing of high speed CMOS circuits. Most of the previous approaches in detecting long and short sensitizable paths assume that the rising and falling of gate delays are either fixed or bounded. In fact the gate delay of CMOS circuits may also depend on how many and which inputs are rising or falling and the arrival times of those rising or falling inputs. For instance, the delay for a two-input CMOS NAND gate may vary as much as a factor of two based on whether one input or two inputs are changing. We shall refer a gate delay model which considers these factors as data dependent delay model. Gray, Liu and Cavin have proposed an approach based on simulation with event pruning to deal with this type of delay model [1]. In this paper, we propose several algorithms to compute the longest and shortest sensitizable path delays based on a data dependent delay model. A proposed algorithm which based on a combination of modified static (topological) timing analysis and path sensitization techniques seems to offer the best performance. The results obtained have shown to be more accurate than the traditional path sensitization approach based on bounded delay model.

Reference-contexts: For instance, based on circuit level simulation on 2m model parameters with all transistor widths and lengths of minimum size, the gate delay of a two-input NAND gate was shown in Table 1 (borrowed from <ref> [1] </ref>). In this table, for any literal x, x" represents x rising, x# represents x falling, x represents that x is a "1" and x represents that x is a "0". <p> improved topological long/short path algorithm 2 Input constraint Event time Output event ab " 600ps # a " b " 680ps # a # b 590ps " ab + ab + ab + ab # +ab " + 1 1 ab 1 0 Table 1: NAND gate delay information from <ref> [1] </ref> based on the data dependent delay model. <p> However, simulation is very time consuming. Gary, Liu and Cavin have proposed a way to reduce the simulation time by an event pruning technique <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper we propose to take a different approach by first simplifying the data dependent gate delay model. Therefore, some efficient algorithms can be designed and developed based on the simplified data dependent gate delay model. <p> The sensitizable path algorithm is based on the algorithm proposed in [2].

Reference-contexts: Long and short path delays were also used to determine clock period for wavepipelined circuits [14], [15], [16]. Determining whether a path is sensitizable or not has been an active research topic and several timing analysis algorithms have been proposed to better estimate the actual delay of a circuit <ref> [2, 10-13] </ref>. Chen and Du have compared several sensitization criteria [2]. Devadas et al [12] and McGeer et.al. [13] have developed methods to compute the longest sensitizable path without explicitly tracing and enumerating paths. <p> Determining whether a path is sensitizable or not has been an active research topic and several timing analysis algorithms have been proposed to better estimate the actual delay of a circuit [2, 10-13].

The delay of the shortest topological path may be a poor estimate of how soon the outputs can become stable. <p> In Section 4, we assume that the gate delays are followed as a bounded delay model, therefore, a modified algorithm which originally proposed in <ref> [2] </ref> is used to get the longest sensitizable path, however the shortest sensitizable path delay can not be used to estimate the minimum transition delay. In Section 5, we propose an algorithm which is a combination of the first two algorithms. The experiment results are shown in Section 6. <p> Similarly the shortest transition path delay obtained is 1700. 4 Path Sensitization Algorithm In the previous section, we proposed an improved topological long/short path algorithm without considering the sensitizability of a path. Now, we briefly present the longest sen-sitizable path algorithm proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>. This algorithm can also be used to estimate the longest path delay under the bounded delay model. We assume that the reader is familiar with the concepts like stable value and stable times of a gate, controlling value and non-controlling inputs to a gate. <p> The sensitizable path algorithm is based on the algorithm proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> In Table 2, TL denotes the topological long path algorithm based on the bounded delay model, OurTL denotes the topological long path algorithm based on the simplified data dependent delay model. ChenDu denotes the algorithm for computing the longest sensitizable path <ref> [2] </ref>. Combination is the algorithm described in the previous section. OurTL algorithm is more accurate than the longest path sensitization algorithm [2] (except C1908) with less computation time. The combination algorithm get the most accurate results with the most computation time. <p> ChenDu denotes the algorithm for computing the longest sensitizable path <ref> [2] </ref>. Combination is the algorithm described in the previous section. OurTL algorithm is more accurate than the longest path sensitization algorithm [2] (except C1908) with less computation time. The combination algorithm get the most accurate results with the most computation time. In Table 3, TS and OurTS denote the shortest topological short path algorithm based on the bounded delay model and the simplified data dependent delay model respectively.

The following definitions will be introduced. Definition 4.1 (Exact Path Sensitization Criterion <ref> [8] </ref>) A path is considered to be an exact sensitizable path, if there is at least one primary input vector such that each on-input of the path is either the earliest controlling input or the latest non-controlling input with all its side inputs being non-controlling inputs too. <p> Definition 4.2 (Loose Path Sensitization Criterion <ref> [8] </ref>) A path is considered to be a loose sensitizable path, if there is at least one primary input vector such that each 14 on-input of the path is either the earliest controlling input or a non-controlling input with all its side inputs being non-controlling inputs too.

Chen [8] proved that these two criteria obtain the same longest sensitizable path delay.

However, it is clear that this algorithm (or any other path sensitization algorithm) based on bounded delay model can still be used in here.
