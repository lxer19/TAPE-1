Reference-contexts: Early western anthropological studies investigating the use and mention of hot and cold concepts have confined themselves to a single culture/language and have generalized a single data set into a Pan-Indian and non-local characteristic. Brenda Beck <ref> [Beck] </ref> first attempted to classify food items as belonging to hot or cold categories. <p> I also share with Lakoff, the guiding intuition that the body is a central site in grounding interpretations of the world including those that pertain to relations of power and dominance. This research borrows from field work by different anthropologists. The work on Javanese [Samson] [Geertz], work on Tamil <ref> [Beck] </ref>, [Daniel], work on Punjabi/Sindhi [Kurin], and on Zimmerman's interpretation of the Ayurvedic texts [Zimmerman], are used as data sources for much of the material developed here. I addition to these textual sources, I will also rely on my own knowledge and experience of different Indian cultures and languages. <p> From the data, it appears that these dimensions could be categorized as: * Edibles * Characteristics of Human emotions * Characteristics of body parts * Colors * Characteristics of Abstract processes and events 2.1 Edible items The first systematic classification of food items was done by Brenda Beck <ref> [Beck] </ref>. While the study was careful and systematic, there were several problems with it.

Reference-contexts: Brenda Beck [Beck] first attempted to classify food items as belonging to hot or cold categories. While such attempts provide original sources of systematic study, other authors <ref> [Daniel] </ref> have pointed out their limitations in explaining the structure and complexity of the conceptual categories themselves (ex. there is a continuum from hot to cold along which substances may be placed, rather than the classical categories used by Beck and others). <p> This research borrows from field work by different anthropologists. The work on Javanese [Samson] [Geertz], work on Tamil [Beck], <ref> [Daniel] </ref>, work on Punjabi/Sindhi [Kurin], and on Zimmerman's interpretation of the Ayurvedic texts [Zimmerman], are used as data sources for much of the material developed here. I addition to these textual sources, I will also rely on my own knowledge and experience of different Indian cultures and languages. <p> The same food item may be hot for one individual but cold for another. At first glance, the above list seems bewilderingly arbitrary. In fact, some researchers have suggested that any attempt at delineating a hot-cold semantic property space for food items may be impossible <ref> [Daniel] </ref>. <p> The exact sequence which involves a grammar of the form (cold) n (hot) m (cold) k , where (cold) k implies a sequence of k cold substances is context-sensitive. The basic pattern bears an intriguing resemblance to Daniel's <ref> [Daniel] </ref> analysis of the flower ritual in Tamil Nadu, and the notion of a context sensitive grammar can be a potential unifying interpretation of the two different rituals. <p> The ritual consists of a priest who throws six packets of flowers (three red hot, and three white cold) and divines the future of the subject for whom the ritual is being performed. Valentine Daniel <ref> [Daniel] </ref> performs an illuminating analysis of the ritual and shows how the ritual is designed to show the interplay between the kunam (actor) and karmam (action) complexes combine to provide a symbolic, and iconic and an indexical grammar of the ritual.

Reference-contexts: The practice of varolation was largely taken over by vaccination. In an analysis of the practice of varolation, <ref> [Arnold] </ref> argues how the practice was locally understood as a way of invoking the protective power of the Goddess Situla's rights over the body of the patient/possessed, instead of violating it.

Reference-contexts: It is interesting to note that the ideas of radial categories and metonymic clusters of multiple variables is also used extensively by McKim Marriott and his students <ref> [Marriott] </ref> in proposing a general ethnosociol-ogy of India. While being less ambitious and much more preliminary, the work here shares some of Marriott's critical insights and wherever possible, I will borrow terms and definitions from his considerable body of work. <p> However, as I will show in the subsequent discussion, recent theories in cognitive science such as the idea of graded and radial categories [Lakoff] combined with notions of systematic metonymic and metaphoric mappings that have been proposed as a foundation for Indian ethnosociology <ref> [Marriott] </ref> may shed some light on the issue. Before proceeding to that discussion, let us look at other kinds of entities that may be categorized along the hot-cold continuum. 2.2 Characteristics of People People can be classified as having hot or cold dispositions (kunams). <p> Such metonymic clusters (through the iconic and indexical relationships) allow for the widely polysemous uses of the concepts of hot and cold in rituals and ceremonies. This allows the priest to use contextual and pragmatic factors making the actual interpretation somewhat flexible. 3 Making Sense Of the Data Marriott <ref> [Marriott] </ref> hypothesis that the three humors, bile, phlegm and wind form a part of a metonymic cluster that can be stated as follows. 1. Wind (vayu) clusters with "air", darkness (tamas) and incoherence (adharma). 2. Bile (pittam) clusters with "fire", passion and energy rajas, and attachment karma. 3.

Reference-contexts: While being less ambitious and much more preliminary, the work here shares some of Marriott's critical insights and wherever possible, I will borrow terms and definitions from his considerable body of work. My theoretical analysis also intersects with Lakoff's <ref> [Lakoff] </ref> work in cognitive linguistics and in the structure of conceptual mappings (conventionalized) metaphors. I also share with Lakoff, the guiding intuition that the body is a central site in grounding interpretations of the world including those that pertain to relations of power and dominance. <p> In fact, some researchers have suggested that any attempt at delineating a hot-cold semantic property space for food items may be impossible [Daniel].

Reference-contexts: One focus of the research described here is to investigate the nature of any cross-cultural semantic property space. * Recent research in cognitive science <ref> [Rosch] </ref> and in cognitive semantics suggest that concepts have a radial character to them, where there may be a central category (or member) that con 1 Of course, the onions were to be purchased from him at foreign returned prices. 2 THE DATA 2 stitutes a prototypical instance, and other categories

Reference-contexts: I am currently looking at the Javanese data which I have reproduced in the appendix. Without much further data analysis, the work proposed here and the theories used could turn out to be like the raft in the following parable from Buddha (as told by A.K. Ramanujan <ref> [Ramanujan] </ref>). In the parable, a man was drowning in a flood. Just as he was about to drown, a raft appeared. He clung on, and the raft carried him safely to dry land.

Reference-contexts: This allowed the practice to be be viewed as a celebration of the Goddess compared to vaccination, which was initially viewed as a violation. Moreno and Marriott <ref> [Moreno] </ref> use the same theoretical framework to analyze the humoral transactions in the worship of the Tamil diety Mariamman (also the Goddess of Smallpox (and also mata or amma).

Reference-contexts: Praying to Ganapathy therefore enables the devotee to utilize the immediate celibacy to obtain enhanced fertility in future through controlled sexual transactions. 4.2 Hot and Cold Characteristics of Space The mixing dimension is generally correlated to the east-west spatial direction. In an analysis of a kerala house design <ref> [Moore] </ref> observes how the house opens out to the east allowing for the intermingling with visitors. As one moves toward the west, the rooms become smaller and more private.

Reference-contexts: In an analysis of a kerala house design [Moore] observes how the house opens out to the east allowing for the intermingling with visitors. As one moves toward the west, the rooms become smaller and more private. Other researchers <ref> [Ifteka] </ref> have noticed how the kitchen hearth always faces the east thereby establishing the mixing dimension of the agni-kama metonymic correlation.
