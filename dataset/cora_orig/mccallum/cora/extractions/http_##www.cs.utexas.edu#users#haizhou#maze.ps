Abstract: With the increasing density of VLSI circuits, interconnection wires are getting packed even closer. This has increased the effect of interaction between wires on circuit performance and hence, the importance of controlling crosstalk. Maze routing is a robust and general approach which can be used in many situations including multi-layer interconnections. In this paper, we consider crosstalk avoidance in maze routing. The crosstalk-constrained maze routing problem is first formulated. Then we show it is equivalent to the multi-constrained shortest path problem and is strongly NP-complete. Based on the Lagrangian relaxation technique, an effective heuristic algorithm is designed to solve the problem.

Reference-contexts: The general theory for sub-gradient method states that if k ! 0 and j=1 j ! 1 as k ! 1, the above algorithm will converge to the optimal solution <ref> [1] </ref>. The only problem with this approach is that there may exist a gap between MCSP and its corresponding La grangian multiplier problem.

Reference-contexts: All these factors increase the coupling effect (inductive and capacitive) between interconnection wires. Increased coupling effect not only increases signal delays, but also decreases signal integrity due to transmission line behavior. This phenomenon is called crosstalk <ref> [2] </ref>. Previous works on crosstalk avoidance in detailed routing of ICs use spacing, track permutation, segment permutation, and layer assignment to reduce crosstalk [3, 5, 6, 9, 13, 14]. These works are mainly focused on a channel or a switchbox. As VLSI technologies evolved, multi-layers of interconnection are commonly available.

Reference-contexts: There fore, by treating 1+ P n i as the weight on edge e, we can solve the LSP problem efficiently by Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> If c i &lt; c ij or c j &lt; c ij , nega tive weight elements are introduced.

Reference-contexts: This problem is similar to the Shortest Weight-Constrained Path (SWCP) problem in <ref> [7] </ref>. But SWCP problem is weakly NP-complete, and can even be solved in polynomial time if all weights are equal or all lengths are equal. However, for MCSP problem, we have the following result. Theorem 1 MCSP-Decision problem is strongly NP-complete. <p> Proof: Given an instance of MCSP-Decision problem, a path from s to t can be checked in polynomial time to see whether the constraints are obeyed. This means that MCSP-decision problem is in NP. We will show that MCSP-Decision is strongly NP-hard by transforming 3-PARTITION <ref> [7] </ref> to it. 3-PARTITION is defined as follows. <p> But even without considering crosstalk, finding a minimum length Steiner tree is NP-hard <ref> [7] </ref>. Fortunately, there are many heuristic algorithms exist in the literature [8]. Many of them have proven worst-case upper bounds and produce good results in practice. Using our Lagrangian relaxation based approach, when routing a multi-terminal net, the crosstalk constraints are also relaxed into the objective function.

Reference-contexts: Although this can not be solved exactly, any minimum Steiner tree heuristic on weighted graphs can be used to find an approximate solution. 5.2 More general crosstalk model In practice, besides coupling capacitance, crosstalk between two nets also depends on their functional and temporal sensitivities <ref> [10] </ref> and the relative drive strengths of their drivers. Therefore, two nets may not have crosstalk even they are routed closely, and for two adjacent wires, crosstalk induced on one wire may not equal to crosstalk induced on the other.

Reference-contexts: Traditional maze routing algorithms route a net by a shortest path or a minimum bend path and can also be modified to accommodate various constraints and path selection criteria <ref> [11] </ref>. But it is hard to modify them to solve the CCMR problem, since what required here is not minimizing the total crosstalk but balancing crosstalk among different nets.

Reference-contexts: However, if crosstalk between nonadjacent wires must be considered, our approach can also be extended. In this case, the coupling capacitance can be computed as follows. coupling-capacitance = ff length distance fi ; where fi is a small constant which was estimated to be about 2 in <ref> [12] </ref>. The only difference between non-adjacent model and the adjacent one is that, in non-adjacency model, we must consider the effect of shielding.
