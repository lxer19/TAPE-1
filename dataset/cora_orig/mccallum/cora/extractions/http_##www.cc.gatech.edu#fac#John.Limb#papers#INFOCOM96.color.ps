Abstract: A revolution is occurring in the scope and range of information, communication and education services that will be made available to schools, libraries, town-halls, clinics and, most importantly, residences. These services will be provided initially, primarily over hybrid fiber-cable systems, either by telephone companies or cable companies. The old cable plant is being upgraded and used in totally new ways. The topology and physical characteristics of the upstream channel present new challenges for efficient channel access. We present a media access protocol that efficiently transfers data on this channel. A primary goal in the design was to keep the portion of the protocol resident in the station as simple as possible. Thus we use centralized control located in the cable head-end and minimize intelligence in the station. We refer to this protocol as Centralized Priority Reservation or CPR. A station wishing to transmit sends a request to the head-end using a contention channel. The head-end acknowledges the request and then schedules the request, informing the station by means of a grant message when to transmit.

Reference-contexts: This path should support communications services for telecommuting and access to information sources in addition to many other services. The existing twisted pair has been used to meet this need to date by means of data modems, ISDN and Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Loop <ref> [1] </ref>. An alternative physical medium to twisted pair is a combination of optical fiber and coaxial cable referred to as Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC). This medium has caught the attention of both the cable industry and the telephone industry so that today many trials are being conducted using HFC.

Reference-contexts: It is important that the protocol exploit the medium efficiently over a range of transmission speeds (say 1 - 100Mb/s) and over relatively long distances (up to 35 km, <ref> [2] </ref>). Latency should be relatively low so that voice conversations and interactive games can be supported (less than a few 10s of ms).

Reference-contexts: It is also important that the protocol support fixed-rate streams of information and multiple priorities for data cells, although these aspects will not be addressed in this paper (see <ref> [3] </ref>). 1.4 Previous Work As previously mentioned, the HFC channel is similar to a satellite channel and, hence, much of that literature is relevant. In particular we have drawn inspiration from early work by Roberts [4] and on the PODA system [5, 6]. <p> The request message consists of three fields. The first is the source identifier. The second is the type field which indicates the type of communication required. In this paper we are concerned primarily with data traffic (but see discussion in Section 4 and <ref> [3] </ref>). The third field is a quantity field and specifies the number of slots that the station requires for a message or packet. <p> At high loads the usage of the data minislot increases, decreasing the collisions in the collision minislots. to each voice circuit (not described in detail in this paper, but see Section 4.3 and <ref> [3] </ref>). The presence of streams reduces the load on collision minislots since they are set up with a single request. <p> A station with only data to transmit need not be aware cable lengths. of the frame structure. The performance of CPR for prioritized traffic and stream traffic is described in <ref> [3] </ref>. 5 Conclusions We have presented a protocol called Centralized Priority Reservation (CPR) for transmission of data over a hybrid Fiber/Cable TV System. The system uses contention slots to forward requests via the upstream channel to the head-end. Here the requests are acknowledged and scheduled for transmission.

Reference-contexts: Counterman uses centralized control to send permits to each station. He makes a clear distinction between access control on one hand and bandwidth allocation mechanisms on the other. By comparison, our proposal, Centralized Priority Reservation, (CPR) uses contention minislots with simple p-persistence to send requests to the H/E <ref> [10] </ref>.

Even with 2 collision minislots the data minislot plays an important role at high loads. </title>
Reference-contexts: If the request is not acknowledged by the H/E in the expected ACK slot then the station repeats the request in the subsequent contention minislots with probability p until the request is transmitted (p-persistence <ref> [11] </ref>). After transmitting the request the station again waits for an ACK from the H/E.
