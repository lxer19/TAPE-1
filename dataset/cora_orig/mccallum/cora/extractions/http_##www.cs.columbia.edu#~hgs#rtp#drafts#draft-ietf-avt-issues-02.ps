Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This memorandum aims to provide a general introduction to some of the issues faced by end-to-end protocols for real-time services. It also provides a general background to some of the design decisions made in RTP <ref> [1] </ref>. The transport protocol for real-time applications (RTP) discussed in this memorandum aims to provide services commonly required by interactive multimedia conferences, such as playout synchronization, demultiplexing, media identification and active-party identification. <p> (now); high = now / MAX_32bit; if (low &gt; ts) - if (low - ts &gt; MAX_31bit) high++; - else - if (ts low &gt; MAX_31bit) high--; - return high * MAX_32bit + ts; - /* clock_extend */ main (int argc, char *argv []) - double c = atof (argv <ref> [1] </ref>); CLOCK_t tx_ntp32_16, tx_ntp16_16; CLOCK_t rx_ntp32_16, rx_ntp16_16; u_long tx_sample, rx_sample; unsigned long rtp; printf ("c=%g"n", c); for (tx_sample = UINT_MAX*0.7499; tx_sample &lt; UINT_MAX; tx_sample++) - /* sample clock -&gt; NTP 32/16 */ tx_ntp32_16 = tx_sample * c; /* -&gt; NTP 16/16 */ tx_ntp16_16 = fmod (tx_ntp32_16, MAX_32bit); /* RTP timestamp */

Reference-contexts: The memorandum builds on operational experience with Van Jacobson's and Steve McCanne's vat audio conferencing tool as well as implementation experience with the author's Nevot network voice terminal. This note will frequently refer to NVP <ref> [2] </ref>, the network voice protocol, a protocol used in two versions for early Internet wide-area packet voice experiments. CCITT has standardized as recommendations G.764 and G.765 a packet voice protocol stack for use in digital circuit multiplication equipment. <p> NVP: network voice protocol; original packet format used in early packet voice experiments; defined in <ref> [2] </ref>. octet: An octet is an 8-bit datum, which may contain values 0 through 255 decimal. Commonly used in ISO and CCITT documents, also known as a byte.

Reference-contexts: The name RTP was chosen to reflect the fact that audio and video conferences may not be the only applications employing its services, while the real-time nature of the protocol is important, setting it apart from other multimedia-transport mechanisms, such as the MIME multimedia mail effort <ref> [3] </ref>. The remainder of this memorandum is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the design goals of this real-time transport protocol. Then, Section 3 describes the services to be provided in more detail. Two appendices discuss the issues of port assignment and multicast address allocation, respectively.

Reference-contexts: The overhead is split evenly between layers 2 and 3. Bandwidth efficiency can be achieved by transporting non-essential or slowly changing protocol state in optional fields or in a separate low-bandwidth control protocol. Also, header compression <ref> [9] </ref> may be used. international: Even now, audio and video conferencing tools are used far beyond the North American continent.

Reference-contexts: The drawback is increased header space and the necessity to create the directory. If options are explicitly coded in the bit mask, the type, number and numbering of options is restricted. This approach is used by PIP <ref> [10] </ref>. 3.1 Control and Data Like most protocols at all layers of a protocol stack, a real-time protocol needs to convey higher-layer data as well as more infrequent control information. separate lower-level streams replace control without affecting data operating system : number of sockets vs. ability to schedule execution inband fate-sharing:

Reference-contexts: The primary example is the synchronization between audio and video (lip-sync). Note that different receivers may experience different delays between the media generation time and their playout time. See <ref> [12] </ref> for a general discussion and a service model. Playout synchronization is required for most media, while intra-media and inter-media synchronization may or may not be implemented. In connection with playout synchronization, we can group packets into playout units, a number of which in turn form a synchronization unit.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we formally describe some of the popular approaches, building on the exposition and terminology of Montgomery <ref> [13] </ref>. We define a number of variables describing the synchronization process. In general, the subscript n represents the nth packet in a synchronization unit, n = 1; 2; : : :.

Reference-contexts: SMPTE time code: SMPTE (commonly pronounced sehm-tee) stands for the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, but has come to denote a particular way of describing frame-based video timing. The SMPTE time code is an international standard <ref> [15] </ref>. It consists of hours, minutes, seconds and frames since the start of the stream, video clip, etc. For NTSC, the frame rate is 29.97 frames per second. This is handled by dropping the first frame index of every minute, except every tenth minute.

Reference-contexts: For NTSC, the frame rate is 29.97 frames per second. This is handled by dropping the first frame index of every minute, except every tenth minute. SMPTE time codes are also used by the MPEG I encoding <ref> [16, p. 131] </ref>, with a one-bit drop flag, five bits for hours, six bits for minutes, 1 'fixed' bit, six bits for seconds and a six-bit frame number. (Valid frame numbers range from 0 to 59). <p> MPEG: The MPEG I encoding uses a 33 bit clock with a resolution of 90 kHz <ref> [16] </ref> as the system clock reference and for presentation time stamps. The frequency was chosen based on the divisibility by the nominal video picture rates of 24 Hz, 25 Hz, 29.97 Hz and 30 Hz [16, p.42]. The frequency would also fit nicely with the 20 ms audio packetization interval. <p> The frequency was chosen based on the divisibility by the nominal video picture rates of 24 Hz, 25 Hz, 29.97 Hz and 30 Hz <ref> [16, p.42] </ref>. The frequency would also fit nicely with the 20 ms audio packetization interval. <p> inappropriate, however, for software implementations. 32 bit timestamps still cover more than half a day and thus can be readily extended to full unique timestamps or 33 bits if needed. "There is no requirement that the PTS value be initialized to any particular value at the start of the stream." <ref> [16, p. 42] </ref>. QuickTime: In the movie resource header, the time scale relates the movie's internal time coordinates to seconds. The time scale, measured in ticks per second, is expressed as a 32-bit integer [17, p. 4-10].

Reference-contexts: discuss only with synchronizing several incoming streams at a single site (many-to-one) so that all media generated at some time t will be delivered to the end application at some time t + D, despite different network delays and clock drift. for a broader approach, including the one-to-many case, see <ref> [18] </ref>. Maintaining synchronization across receivers will require additional coordination messages. The difficulty of compensating for the difference in speed between sample clocks and system clocks depends on the type of data carried. We can distinguish continuous media and media with synchronization units. <p> Also, it may well be that sender and receiver sample clocks are both either fast or slow, so that less compensation is required by just having the receiver take care of the difference. 6.3.3 Synchronization between Streams As pointed out in <ref> [18] </ref> and elsewhere, many-to-one synchronization, that is, synchronizing several sources at a single receiver, only requires agreeing on the maximum playout compensation. For conciseness of explanation, we consider two media, say audio and video, and assume that sample clock and system clock have the same frequency.

Reference-contexts: The error detection performance and computational cost of some common 16-bit checksumming algorithms are summarized in Table 4. The implementations were drawn from <ref> [20] </ref> and compiled on a SPARC IPX using the Sun ANSI C compiler with optimization. The checksum computation was repeated 100 times; thus, due to data cache effects, the execution times shown are probably better than would be measured in an actual application. The relative performance, however, should be similar. <p> The relative performance, however, should be similar. Among the algorithms, the CRC has the strongest error detection properties, particularly for burst errors, while the remaining algorithms are roughly equivalent <ref> [20] </ref>. The Fletcher algorithm with modulo 255 (shown here) has the peculiar property that a transformation of a byte from 0 to 255 remains undetected. CRC, the IP checksum and Fletcher's algorithm cannot detect spurious zeroes at the end of a variable-length message [21].
