Abstract: We present a definition of cause and effect in terms of decision-theoretic primitives and thereby provide a principled foundation for causal reasoning. Our definition departs from the traditional view of causation in that causal assertions may vary with the set of decisions available. We argue that this approach provides added clarity to the notion of cause. Also in this paper, we examine the encoding of causal relationships in directed acyclic graphs. We describe a special class of influence diagrams, those in canonical form, and show its relationship to Pearl's representation of cause and effect. Finally, we show how canonical form facilitates counterfactual reasoning.

Reference-contexts: We describe the notion of limited unresponsiveness in earlier work in terms 411 Heckerman & Shachter of a conditional fixed set <ref> (Heckerman and Shachter, 1994) </ref>. Angrist et al. (1995) discuss an instance of limited unresponsiveness, which they call the exclusion restriction. To be more formal, let X [S; D] be the instance that X assumes (with certainty) given the state of the world S and the act D. <p> If X has c instances and Y has a instances, then X (Y ) has as many as c a instances. In real-world domains, however, reasonable assertions of independence decrease the number of required assessments. In some cases, no additional assessments are necessary <ref> (see, e.g., Heckerman et al., 1994) </ref>. Third, we have the following theorem, which follows immediately from the definitions of limited unresponsiveness and mapping variable.

Reference-contexts: Rubin (1978) and Howard (1990) have formalized this idea. 2. Savage (1954) defines an act to be "a function attaching a consequence to each state of the world." In contrast, we take act to be a primitive, as do many decision analysts <ref> (e.g., Howard, 1990) </ref>. 3. When acts and consequences are continuous, the specification of S is more complicated.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4, we review a directed-acyclic-graph (DAG) representation, known as an influence diagram, which has been used for two decades by decision analysts to model the effects of decisions <ref> (Howard and Matheson, 1981) </ref>. We demonstrate the inadequacies of the influence diagram as a representation of cause. In the following three sections, we develop a special condition on the influence diagram, known as canonical form, that improves the representation of cause. <p> chance nodes corresponding to decision and chance variables, and information and relevance arcs, representing what is known at the time of a decision and probabilistic dependence, respectively, (2) a set of probability distributions associated with each chance node, and optionally (3) a utility node and a corresponding set of utilities <ref> (Howard and Matheson, 1981) </ref>. An information arc is one that points to a decision node.

Reference-contexts: That is, if variables X and Y are d-separated by Z in G, then X and Y are conditionally independent given Z according to the structural-equation model corresponding to G. <ref> (See Pearl, 1988, for a definition of d-separation.) </ref> SGS (p. 54) refer to this association as the causal Markov condition. 15. Note that the mapping variable x (Y; ^x) has the same number of instances as does the mapping variable x (Y ).
