Abstract: One of the major obstacles facing designers of video conferencing systems is the problem of ameliorating the effects of congestion on interconnected packetswitched networks that do not support real-time communication. We present a framework for transmission control that describes the current network environment as a set of sustainable bit and packet transmission-rate combinations and show that adaptively scaling both the bit and packet-rate of the audio and video streams can reduce the impact of congestion. We empirically demonstrate the validity of adapting both packet and bit-rate using a simple feedback mechanism and simple adaptation heuristics to deliver audio and video streams suitable for low-latency, high-fidelity playout.

Reference-contexts: The second is to adaptively scale (reduce or increase) the bandwidth requirements of audio/video streams to match that currently sustainable in the network. Examples of this approach include the spatial and temporal scaling mechanisms in the HeiTS system <ref> [1] </ref>, and the simple temporal scaling in MTP [3]. Our thesis is that on campus-sized internetworks, one can effectively manage streams of live audio and video data by adaptively scaling the streams in both the bit-rate and packet-rate dimensions.

Reference-contexts: The latency graph in Figure 8a shows that the baseline transmission strategy also gives long periods of high audio and video latency. Studies have found that latency of this magnitude is unacceptable for video conferencing <ref> [2, 7] </ref>. The second experiment exercises the recent success transmission control algorithm. Our implementation of this algorithm determines when to adapt the operating point based upon the 8 number of frames delivered per second.

Reference-contexts: The conferencing software was built at the UNC and is described elsewhere <ref> [4] </ref>. Unless oth erwise stated, the conferencing system generates 60 audio frames and 30 video frames per second. Audio and video are transmitted separately as UDP messages with one frame per packet.

Reference-contexts: Figure 8b gives the performance of the algorithm. The delivered frame rates are well within the ranges controllable by jitter control schemes such as those described in <ref> [5] </ref>. The latency of the conference is also improved. Note that network latency is now only a small component of the capture latency of the audio stream.

Reference-contexts: The first is to proactively protect audio/video streams from the effects of congestion by reserving resources (e.g., buffers and CPU cycles at a router) on behalf of these streams. Examples of such reservation based approaches include the Internet protocols ST-II <ref> [6] </ref> and RSVP [8]. The second is to adaptively scale (reduce or increase) the bandwidth requirements of audio/video streams to match that currently sustainable in the network.
