Abstract: This paper describes lessons learned in the design, construction and programming of a team of three reactive trash-collecting robots. The robots placed first in the Office Cleanup Event at the 1994 AAAI Mobile Robot Competition. The discussion includes details of multiagent cooperation, color vision for the detection of perceptual object classes, temporal sequencing of behaviors for task completion, and a language for specifying motor schema-based robot behaviors. We also address questions regarding architectual design choices in the robots' construction.

Reference-contexts: The behavioral paradigm used in this work, and in other research at Georgia Tech's Mobile Robot Laboratory, is motor schema-based control (Arkin 1989). Like other reactive systems (Brooks 1986), motor schemas offer low computational overhead; additionally, they provide for integration with temporal sequencing <ref> (Arkin & MacKenzie 1994) </ref> approaches (used here), and deliberative approaches (Arkin 1992b) (not used here). Individual schemas are primitive behaviors that are combined to generate more complex emergent behaviors. Schemas are independent computational processes for sensing and acting that run in parallel. <p> At-tractors are items of interest scattered randomly about the environment, analogous to trash in the cleanup task. In later work by Balch and Arkin <ref> (Balch & Arkin 1994) </ref> additional tasks are explored, communication between robots is added, and the behaviors are validated on Denning MRV-2 mobile robots. <p> N robots complete a task more than N times as fast as a single robot <ref> (Balch & Arkin 1994) </ref>. 1 The retrieval task examined in (Arkin 1992a; Arkin, Balch, & Nitz 1993; Balch & Arkin 1994) is slightly different from the competition task. <p> In this way the performance advantages, or lack thereof, of added complexity are revealed. Coordination and cooperation between multiple robots is possible through communication. In earlier research, three levels of robot communication have been identified and explored <ref> (Balch & Arkin 1994) </ref>. From least to most complex, they are: no communication, state communication and goal communication. <p> Although it has not be ruled out, our research has not yet identified a need for central coordination between robots. Interfaces- How can human expertise be easily brought into an agent's decisions? An elegant mechanism for human interaction with robots at the societal level is by teleautonomous control <ref> (Arkin & Ali 1994) </ref>. A human's input is integrated as a motor schema along with a robot's separate autonomous behaviors. Important local reactive behaviors, like those for avoiding obstacles and staying on roads, are preserved; while global human directives, as in "everybody go north," are followed by the society. <p> Performance- What types of performance goals and metrics can realistically be used for agents operating in dynamic, uncertain, and even actively hostile environments? How can an architecture make guarantees about its performance with respect to the time-critical aspect of the agent's physical environment? Some performance metrics, proposed in <ref> (Balch & Arkin 1994) </ref>, for multiagent robotic systems include: * Cost Build a system to accomplish the task for the minimum cost. This may be appropriate for many industrial tasks. <p> The result is a mobile robotic system that is able to self-improve performance of its task by adapting itself to the specifics of the environment it is operating in. <ref> (Santamara & Arkin 1994) </ref> describes an perceptual algorithm able to recognize and localize environmental objects using only ultrasonic range data.

Reference-contexts: Multiagent Cooperation Recent multiagent robotics research at Georgia Tech has investigated tasks for robots similar to the "clean up the office" task. In the work of Arkin (Arkin 1992a) and Arkin, Balch and Nitz <ref> (Arkin, Balch, & Nitz 1993) </ref>, simulated robots are tasked to collect "attractors" in the environment and return them to a home base. At-tractors are items of interest scattered randomly about the environment, analogous to trash in the cleanup task. <p> Implicit communication. The robots are not equipped with communication hardware, but they can sense each other's location visually due to their distinctive color. Previous research has shown that robots can take advantage of knowledge of other robots' locations to more efficiently forage <ref> (Arkin, Balch, & Nitz 1993) </ref>. This strategy is a form of implicit communication since "transmission" of position information does not require a deliberate act. Receiving robots simply observe the other robots visually. Reactive behaviors. The robot's complex behavior is organized by combining primitive behaviors that run concurrently.

Reference-contexts: The individual behaviors are then triggered in an appropriate sequence by a simple behavioral manager (the technique is referred to as "temporal sequencing"). The behavioral paradigm used in this work, and in other research at Georgia Tech's Mobile Robot Laboratory, is motor schema-based control <ref> (Arkin 1989) </ref>. Like other reactive systems (Brooks 1986), motor schemas offer low computational overhead; additionally, they provide for integration with temporal sequencing (Arkin & MacKenzie 1994) approaches (used here), and deliberative approaches (Arkin 1992b) (not used here). <p> Individual behaviors for each of the several steps in the "clean up office" task were developed and tested on the robots, and appropriate gain values were determined empirically. Readers are referred to <ref> (Arkin 1989) </ref> for a more detailed description of the gains and parameters of specific motor schemas. Sequenced coordination or temporal sequencing is the process by which the robot control system moves through a series of distinct behaviors (MacKenzie & Arkin 1993; Arkin & MacKenzie 1994). <p> Representation- How much internal representation of knowledge and skills is needed? How should the agent organize and represent its inter nal knowledge and skills? The internal model of capabilities and action in our architecture is based on the motor schema-based control approach <ref> (Arkin 1989) </ref>. Skills, or primitive behaviors, are represented as schemas. Schemas are units of behavioral knowledge. They are responsible for accomplishing basic perceptual and motor tasks. There are two classes of schemas: perceptual and motor.

Reference-contexts: A fixed set of motor behaviors and perceptual schemas was preprogrammed beforehand and organized using a finite state automaton. Thus, the robot was not able to learn new motor behaviors, perceptual strategies nor schema selection and activation. Nevertheless, there is ongoing research in learning the three knowledge types: <ref> (Ram & Santamara 1993) </ref> describes a robotic system that is able to learn when to select and dynamically adapt the activation levels of motor schemas according to environmental conditions.
