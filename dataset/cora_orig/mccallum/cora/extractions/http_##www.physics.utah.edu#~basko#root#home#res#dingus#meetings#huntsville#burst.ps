Abstract: EGRET has detected the highest energy emission from gamma-ray bursts. Only a few bursts have been detected either coincident or just following the BATSE detected emission. These bursts are among the brightest bursts detected by BATSE. The EGRET fluxes, including upper limits, are consistent with extrapolations for all the burst spectra measured with Comptel.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION EGRET on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory observed gamma-rays up to 20 GeV over an hour after the beginning of the gamma-ray burst on 12 February 1997 <ref> [1] </ref>. This burst has the highest fluence as recorded by BATSE within EGRET's field of view. Other weaker bursts have also been detected by EGRET. Three others have significant emission within the time interval that the sub-MeV emission was detected. <p> Essentially all charged particles are rejected by a combination of the anticoincidence shield, the time-of-flight directional trigger, and the unique signature of pair production in the tracking detector. BURSTS DETECTED &gt; 30 MEV The 4 bursts which are detected simultaneous with the sub-MeV emission are GRB940217 <ref> [1] </ref>, GRB910503 [3,4], GRB930131 [5,4], and GRB940301 [6]. These bursts are listed in order of decreasing significance of the &gt; 30 MeV emission being of longer duration than the emission detected by BATSE [7].

Reference-contexts: These seven bursts are among the brightest, as defined by their sub-MeV emission, within EGRET's field of view and have also all been detected by Comptel on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory <ref> [2] </ref>. The upper limits or flux densities for all bursts detected by Comptel and with EGRET exposure are compared. The flux or upper limits are consistent with an extrapolation of the Comptel measured power law.

Reference-contexts: These bursts are listed in order of decreasing significance of the &gt; 30 MeV emission being of longer duration than the emission detected by BATSE <ref> [7] </ref>. These bursts are not in exact order of decreasing fluence as detected by BATSE; however, they are among the brightest bursts within EGRET's field of view. Also, the probability of detecting delayed emission depends on other factors such as effective area and Galactic latitude.

Reference-contexts: The differential photon spectral index for the fit line is 1.950.25. power law fit has a differential photon index of 1.950.25. While this average spectrum is flatter than the average indicated by the 1-30 MeV spectral indices of these bursts <ref> [8] </ref>, the uncertainty is large since only 4 gamma-rays are over 1 GeV. A comparison of the fluence during T90 and after T90 is difficult to make for these 4 bursts.

Reference-contexts: However, three other bursts have 1 or 0 gamma-rays during T90, but still show some indication of delayed emission. Specifically, the combined number of gamma-rays from GRB910601 <ref> [9] </ref>, GRB910627, and GRB950421 that are detected before 200 sec after the BATSE trigger is 16 when only 4 are expected from the diffuse gamma-ray background. These bursts are still among the brightest bursts, as measured by BATSE, within EGRET's field of view.

Reference-contexts: FUTURE WORK The detection of even a few high energy gamma-rays has significantly challenged our understanding of gamma-ray burst sources. Bulk Lorentz factors of several 100 are required for bursts originating at cosmological distances in order to avoid gamma-gamma pair production <ref> [10] </ref>. The long time delays could be explained by shock fronts hitting an interstellar medium [11] or parts of the shock moving at slower speeds [12].

Obviously more information is needed both more bursts detected and more gamma-rays per burst. EGRET will detect more bursts.

Rate of EGRET triggers (dashed line) and EGRET triggers clearly identified as gamma rays (solid line) near 3 bright gamma-ray bursts. For GRB970704, the EGRET spark chambers were turned off until about 20 sec after the BATSE trigger, so it was not possible to identify any of these triggers as gamma rays. </title>
Reference-contexts: GLAST, a larger instrument with a larger field of view and without large dead times, will see more bursts and gamma rays in each burst <ref> [14] </ref>. Getting more gamma-rays per burst from EGRET is also possible. Specif- ically, a large fraction of the events recorded by EGRET are not accepted as gamma-rays because the particle tracks could be interpreted as charged particles or because the gamma-ray track started in the wall of the detector.
