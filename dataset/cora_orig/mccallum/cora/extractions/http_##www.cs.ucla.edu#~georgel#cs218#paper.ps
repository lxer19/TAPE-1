Abstract: The need for wireless communication is very apparent, as evident with the recent proliferation of pagers, cellular telephones and digital assistants. This technology is very important us, but there are still challenges ahead in allowing this wireless technology to be as ubiquitous as we would want. There are several research projects underway around the world, each with its own solution to the various problems of mobility management. In this paper, we will restrict ourselves to wireless ATM projects. When the mobile user moves, there are some issues which arise - two of which are handoff and routing. We will examine some solutions to rerouting and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.

Reference-contexts: Research efforts are underway to address this situation namely IPv6 [DH95] and ATM. There is also a growing demand for wireless cellular communications. People want communication anytime and anywhere. Coupling these two demands has led to other research efforts, such as MobileIP [PB93] and wireless ATM <ref> [HV+94, RW94, AMS96] </ref>. ATM is an attractive technology for carrying future broadband communication services. It is characterized by fixed packet-based tranport, bandwidth-upon-demand, and multimedia traffic integration. Therefore ATM is a promising technology to integrate the wireless network to provide high bandwidth multimedia service to the mobile users.

Reference-contexts: Note that home stations are associated with a connection, not a mobile host. Since the home stations are slowly updated, a mobile host having several connections and moving around quite a bit may have several home stations. 2.4.2 Virtual Connection Trees Acampora and Naghshineh <ref> [AN94] </ref> also propose a tree based routing scheme to handle mobility. The trend toward smaller cell sizes leads to a higher frequency of handoffs. Each handoff requires rerouting for the connection, and normally requires invoking the network call processor.

Reference-contexts: Each base station combines ATM switching functionality with wireless access interfaces. The base stations can be connected in an ad hoc manner to form the LAN backbone. BAHAMA combines connected oriented and con-nectionless schemes in its usage of the ATM VP/VC concept. In a scheme <ref> [CP+94] </ref> proposed to support connectionless ATM LANs, the VP/VC fields are interpreted as source and destination addresses. In BAHAMA, the VPs are used to address the base stations. Each VP defines a path to the base station. VCs are used to differentiate the connections along the VP.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction With the explosion of the Internet, people are beginning to demand more services from the network. This creates a need for an integrated services network to handle this traffic. Research efforts are underway to address this situation namely IPv6 <ref> [DH95] </ref> and ATM. There is also a growing demand for wireless cellular communications. People want communication anytime and anywhere. Coupling these two demands has led to other research efforts, such as MobileIP [PB93] and wireless ATM [HV+94, RW94, AMS96]. ATM is an attractive technology for carrying future broadband communication services.

Reference-contexts: The two schemes are applied to different situations. The first, BAHAMA, is used in the LAN environment, while the second one, using virtual connection trees, is more applicable to the WAN environment. 2.4.1 BAHAMA AT&T propose a wireless ATM LAN called BA-HAMA (Broadband Ad Hoc ATM Anywhere) <ref> [EK+95, VKE95] </ref>. The LAN consists of two elements: base stations and mobile hosts. Each base station combines ATM switching functionality with wireless access interfaces. The base stations can be connected in an ad hoc manner to form the LAN backbone.

Reference-contexts: At connection set up time, a call procesor establishes a path or a network route based on the connection traffic characteristics such that no network node or transmission link is overburdened and the quality of service guaranteed to other existing calls is maintained <ref> [GRV90] </ref>. However, in the wireless environment, mobility or change of channel quality causes the user's access point to the wired network to change constantly, and the mobile user's call must be rerouted each time the mobile user moves to another base station.

Reference-contexts: The trend toward smaller cell sizes leads to a higher frequency of handoffs. Each handoff requires rerouting for the connection, and normally requires invoking the network call processor. The network call processor is cited as the bottleneck which can limit the scaling of wireless systems <ref> [Goo90] </ref>. Acampora and Naghshineh propose a virtual connection tree architecture to overcome this. Each connection tree serves a geographical region. Handoffs within a virtual connection tree do not invoke the call processor. Only handoffs between two virtual connection trees would require the call processor.

Reference-contexts: The virtual circuit used prior to handoff is no longer valid, in the sense that it does not reach the mobile host's current location. The problem to address is one of rerouting the old virtual circuit to the new location. Rerouting schemes have several issues to address <ref> [IPC96] </ref>: * VC Repair: This is the most obvious issue. The old VC no longer works, and it must be repaired in some fashion. * Cell Loss: Due to repairing the old VC, an algorithm might incur some cell loss.

Reference-contexts: Data coming down the old path will be forwarded to the new base station. Forwarded data will be first sent to the mobile host. Buffering of cells is done in order to preserve the right sequencing order. 2.3 Multicast Based Keeton et. al in <ref> [KM+93] </ref> propose using a mul-ticast based approach when it comes to rerouting connections. Their goal was to support mobility for multimedia applications, such as video conferencing. They assume that multicasting services exist and leverage off it. Their scheme is simple and straightforward.

Reference-contexts: Also as wireless communication systems move toward smaller size cells in order to accommodate more users or to provide high capacity (greater frequency reuse over the same geographic region) <ref> [Ran95] </ref>, handoffs will become more frequent, and the handoff signalling traffic can become substantial.

Reference-contexts: That is where the VC repair takes place. The new path is extended from that point to the mobile host's new location. Partial repair algorithms attempt to reuse as much of the old, existing path as possible. 2.2.1 Multi-tier Wireless Clustering Archi tecture Chai-Keong Toh, in <ref> [Toh95, Toh96] </ref>, discusses partial repair of VCs. In his system, cells are grouped into clusters, and each cluster is attached to a ATM switch, which called the cluster switch (see Figure 2. Thus, the handoff of the mobile hosts can be categorize into two types: intra-cluster handoff and inter-cluster handoff.

Thus, the handoff of the mobile hosts can be categorize into two types: intra-cluster handoff and inter-cluster handoff. <p> It is obvious that for moderate size N , the probability of a mobile host crossing an intra-cluster edge is much higher than it crossing an inter-cluster edge. Thus, intra-cluster handoffs are more frequent and must be made fast and efficient. <ref> [Toh96] </ref> contains four CX discovery algorithms. We will present one of them, called Backward Tracking CX Discovery (see Figure 4). The search is ini 3 tiated by the old base station. It backtracks along the existing path nodes, one at a time, starting from the base station.
