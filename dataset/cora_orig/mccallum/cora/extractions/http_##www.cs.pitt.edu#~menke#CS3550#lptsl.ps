Abstract: With rapid technological advances being made in the area of wireless communications it is expected that, in the near future, mobile users will be able to access a wide variety of services that will be made available over future high-speed networks. The quality of these services in the high-speed network domain can be specified in terms of several QOS parameters. In this paper we identify a new QOS parameter for the mobile environment, called loss profiles, that ensures graceful degradation of service (for applications that can tolerate loss) in situations where user demands exceed the network's capacity to satisfy them. A new transport sub-layer is proposed that efficiently implements this new QOS parameter. We also show how this protocol can be easily incorporated into existing proposals for high-speed network transport layer protocols.

Reference-contexts: This results in the TCP sender timing out and retransmitting the unacknowledged packets thus greatly reducing the efficiency of the connection. A solution to this problem is the I-TCP protocol, a modified TCP protocol, implemented at Rutgers University as part of the DataMan project (see Barke <ref> [1] </ref>), that provides efficient reliable communication for the wireless environment. A benefit of the above implementation is that it allows mobile hosts to be connected over the Internet.

Reference-contexts: The audio stream consists of talk "spurts" which are interleaved with silence periods. The length of the talk spurts is exponentially distributed with a mean of 1.2 seconds while the length of the silence period is exponentially distributed with a mean of 1.8 seconds (see Brady <ref> [2] </ref>). The talk spurts generate fixed-sized segments of 160 bytes every 20 msec. We generated a simulated MPEG-2 encoded video bit stream. The reader is referred to ISO 2-13818 [24] for details on the MPEG-2 standard.

Reference-contexts: Thus mobile users will be able to set up connections with other mobile or fixed hosts and continue to receive service along these connections as they move about. Some of the protocols to maintain connections in the face of mobility are discussed in Singh <ref> [4] </ref> and Teraoka [16]. In order to support the wide range of services discussed earlier, future (i.e., 3rd generation) wireless networks will have to be considered extensions of fixed (or wired) networks. This implies a need for developing new networking protocols suited to the wireless environment. <p> However, in a real world implementation of a mobile network, it is probably a better idea to use virtual circuits at the network layer. This avoids the problem of end-to-end retransmissions and can more effectively deal with mobility issues. One such solution has been proposed in Singh <ref> [4] </ref>. * Future applications to be provided to mobile users will include audio (e.g., telephone, audio conferencing, etc.) and video applications (e.g., map information, viewing movies, etc.). These applications have real-time constraints and therefore cannot be implemented using the I-TCP or UDP protocol. <p> In addition, since a SH manages many MSSs, it is reasonable to centralize the complexity within the SH and make the MSS nodes simple devices. We discuss flow-control and connection management issues within our architecture in Singh <ref> [4] </ref>. In the remainder of this paper we assume our architecture, though our results are applicable, with few or no changes, to the traditional architectures as well. 7 3.2 LPTSL: Loss Profile Transport Sub-Layer Implementing loss profiles to behave as described presents us with a design problem.

Reference-contexts: In the case of MPEG video, only the bidirectional (i.e., B) frames or the predicted (i.e., P) frames must be discarded and not the index (i.e., the I) frames (see Hung <ref> [5] </ref>). * Viewer perception must be taken into account when data is discarded for a connection. In other words, there are different ways of discarding x% of data. The `best' way will depend upon the nature of the application.

Reference-contexts: In addition to these functions, the MSSs also provide commonly used applications software to mobile users who can download it and run it locally or run it remotely on the MSS itself (see Badrinath <ref> [6] </ref>). MSS nodes are connected to one another and to commercial high-speed networks thus providing universal connectivity to all mobile users, Figure 2. <p> Later, we address the problem of incorporating loss profiles within the network protocol hierarchy. 3.1 Network Architecture Considerations Traditional mobile network architectures (see for example Badrinath <ref> [6] </ref> and Maguire [7]) are illustrated in implementing loss profiles. This is because, 1. Consider a situation where a mobile user moves between several crowded cells (thus requiring data to be discarded in each cell).

Reference-contexts: These applications have real-time constraints and therefore cannot be implemented using the I-TCP or UDP protocol. Transport protocols proposed for high-speed networks (such as the Multistream Protocol or MSP, see Schwartz <ref> [8] </ref>), that provide numerous features to support such applications, cannot be adapted to the mobile environment because the bandwidth availability can vary over the lifetime of a connection in mobile environments. This is caused because users in a mobile environment are mobile and unpredictable in their movement. <p> Section 5 shows how loss profiles can be easily incorporated into the MPEG-2 specification and section 4 shows how this can be done for the Multi-stream Protocol of Schwartz <ref> [8] </ref>. We consider MPEG-2 specifically because we expect many future video-based applications to be based on the MPEG-2 standard. <p> For example, in BSD UNIX, a piece of data is read and written at least twice in its entirety while traversing from the system call down to the network interface hardware (see Partridge [11]). To alleviate this problem we adopt the approach of Schwartz <ref> [8] </ref> where data is maintained in kernel space until transmission time. The rest of this section is divided into three parts. In section 4.1 we discuss the implementation of LPTSL on the Multi-Stream Protocol of Schwartz [8] as an illustration. <p> To alleviate this problem we adopt the approach of Schwartz <ref> [8] </ref> where data is maintained in kernel space until transmission time. The rest of this section is divided into three parts. In section 4.1 we discuss the implementation of LPTSL on the Multi-Stream Protocol of Schwartz [8] as an illustration. A similar description can be constructed for any other transport layer specification. For instance, we are currently building LPTSL on top of UDP (in the process UDP has been modified to make it more efficient). <p> This prevents unnecessary protocol processing overhead and improves overall performance of the network. Further, by dividing the protocol into minimally dependent parallel machines, MSP can achieve high performance while retaining its highly functional nature. The reader is referred to Schwartz <ref> [8] </ref> for details regarding the MultiStream protocol. 4.1.1 Modifications required to incorporate Loss Profiles To modify the existing protocol to fit our operating needs in a mobile environment, we need additional functionality at the transport system in the form of new system calls and the ability to interpret modified packet formats.

Reference-contexts: Research has indicated that performance bottlenecks are shifting from the network infrastructure to the transport system infrastructure resulting in a throughput preservation problem, where only a limited fraction of the available bandwidth is actually delivered to applications (see Schmidt <ref> [12] </ref>). One of the significant contributors to this problem is the excessive memory-to-memory copying that takes place amongst the various layers within a networking protocol suite.

Reference-contexts: This adds significantly to the complexity of MSS nodes. 3.1.1 Summary of our proposed Architecture Our proposed architecture is discussed in detail in Singh <ref> [14] </ref>. We summarize the main points in this section. The architecture of our system may be viewed as a three-level hierarchy. At the lowest level are the mobile users (MH) who communicate with MSS nodes in each cell. Several MSSs are controlled by a machine called the Supervisor Host (SH).

Reference-contexts: The possibilities are endless and the user is provided with the functionality of adding new functions as new applications are introduced to the system. This approach also is attractive because, as discussed in Lazowska <ref> [17] </ref>, a user linkable library provides for easier management.
