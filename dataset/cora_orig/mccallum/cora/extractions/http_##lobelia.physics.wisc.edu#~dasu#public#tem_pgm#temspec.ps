Reference-contexts: These sequences will run at the full 60 MHz clock speed and provide detailed tests of the interface between 1 trigger, DAQ and front end electronics. The general functionality implemented by these modules is described in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 General Overview The TEM is a 6U high, 160mm long, .084" thick (as opposed to the standard .062" thickness) VME card. The card contains a standard A24:D16 VME slave interface, with the ability to generate bus interrupts. The card uses a mixture of ECL and TTL logic.
Reference: [2] <institution> The VMEbus Specification, Revision C.1, </institution> <year> 1985. </year>
Reference-contexts: The card acts as an A24:D16 slave. The card supports Address-Only cycles <ref> [2] </ref>, but does not support block transfers. It does support read-modify-write cycles. 5.1.1 Address Modifiers All I/O addressable space on the card is accessable in Standard Address Space, for Data Access.
