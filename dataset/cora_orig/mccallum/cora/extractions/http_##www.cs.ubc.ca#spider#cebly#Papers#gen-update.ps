Abstract: Belief revision and belief update have been proposed as two types of belief change serving different purposes. Belief revision is intended to capture changes of an agent's belief state reflecting new information about a static world. Belief update is intended to capture changes of belief in response to a changing world. We argue that both belief revision and belief update are too restrictive; routine belief change involves elements of both. We present a model for generalized update that allows updates in response to external changes to inform the agent about its prior beliefs. This model of update combines aspects of revision and update, providing a more realistic characterization of belief change. We show that, under certain assumptions, the original update postulates are satisfied. We also demonstrate that plain revision and plain update are special cases of our model, in a way that formally verifies the intuition that revision is suitable for static belief change.

Reference-contexts: As proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon (KM), updates reflect changes in the world, and transitions can be used to model such changes. However, in contrast to the KM model and following our earlier work <ref> (Boutilier 1994a) </ref>, we assume that the relative plausibility of transitions (and hence possible updates) is not something that is judged directly; rather we assume that events or actions provide the impetus for change. <p> In general, belief change will involve certain aspects of both revision and update. Rather than generalizing the KM update semantics directly, we adopt the approach of <ref> (Boutilier 1994a) </ref>, where we argued that evolutions or changes in the world should not be ranked directly. We suppose that events or actions provide the impetus for change, and the plausibility of a given evolution is determined by the plausibility of the event that caused the change. <p> We call this evolution of w into v a transition, 2 Note that one cannot escape the dilemma by supposing there is no such transition, for postulate (U3) ensures that updating acid by blue is consistent <ref> (Boutilier 1994a) </ref>. which we write w e ! v. We occasionally assume the existence of the null event n, such that w;n (w) = 0 and w;n (v) = 1 if w 6= v. The null event ensures (with certainty) that the world does not change. <p> If test failures are more rare (r &lt; g), then this outcome would cause the agent to believe the beaker held kryptonite. 4 Relationship to Revision and Update The analysis of the update postulates is similar to that presented in <ref> (Boutilier 1994a) </ref>. There we described a model of update that used plausible events to explain the occurrence of observations, giving rise to an update operator. Only under 4 The world In-DryB-WetG at = 3 is shown for illustration. <p> The key difference here is that the abductive approach has been generalized to allow ranked outcomes of events, and more importantly, ranked belief structures. Surprisingly, this has little bearing on the update postulates: the same assumptions are required. We describe these briefly, and refer to <ref> (Boutilier 1994a) </ref> for further discussion. We first note that our model satisfies a number of the KM postulates. Prop. 2 If is the GU operator induced by some GU model then satisfies postulates (U1), (U4), (U6), (U7) and (U9). <p> Prop. 4 If is induced by a complete GU model then satisfies (U3), (U5) and (U8). In <ref> (Boutilier 1994a) </ref> we criticized (U3) as inappropriate for the update of flat belief sets. For example, if our beliefs corresponded to a single world where acid is believed, (U3) forces the observation of blue to behave quite poorly (as described above). <p> In this case, we simply give up the belief acid. There are a number of systematic ways in which one can enforce the condition of completeness such as requiring the existence of miraculous events that can cause anything <ref> (Boutilier 1994a) </ref>. In our setting, one quite reasonable condition we might impose is that all worlds have some plausibility (i.e., is a total function on W ) and that the null event is possible (not necessarily plausible) at each of those.

Reference-contexts: There have been attempts to provide general semantics for belief change operators (e.g., <ref> (Friedman and Halpern 1994) </ref>); but often these models are such that under certain assumptions the change is a revision and under others it is an update.

Reference-contexts: We insist that 1 (0) 6= ;, so that maximally plausible worlds are assigned rank 0. These maximally plausible worlds are exactly those consistent with the agent's beliefs; that is, the epistemically possible worlds according to K are those deemed most plausible in (see <ref> (Spohn 1987) </ref> for further details). We sometimes assume is a partial function, and loosely write (w) = 1 to mean (w) is not defined (i.e., w is not in the domain of , or is impossible).
