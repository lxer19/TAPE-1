Title: Cryptanalysis of the Cellular Message Encryption Algorithm  
Author: David Wagner Bruce Schneier John Kelsey 
Keyword: cryptanalysis, block ciphers, cellular telephone  
Affiliation: University of California, Berkeley Counterpane Systems  
Abstract: This paper analyzes the Telecommunications Industry Association's Cellular Message Encryption Algorithm (CMEA), which is used for confidentiality of the control channel in the most recent American digital cellular telephony systems. We describe an attack on CMEA which requires 40-80 known plaintexts, has time complexity about 2 24 -2 32 , and finishes in minutes or hours of computation on a standard workstation. This demonstrates that CMEA is deeply flawed.

Reference-contexts: The cellular telephony industry players are especially concerned with fraud prevention. The FCC estimates that the cellular industry loses more than $400 million per year to fraud <ref> [FCC97] </ref>. Cellphone cloning is probably the foremost form of this problem. Because most of today's cellphones identify themselves over public radio links by sending their identity information in the clear, eavesdroppers can (and do) easily misappropriate others' identity information to make fraudulent phone calls.

Reference-contexts: Hillyard <ref> [Hil97] </ref> has noted that codebook attacks may still be possible in practice. In some contexts, each digit dialed will be encrypted in a separate CMEA block (with fixed padding); because CMEA is used in ECB mode, the result is a simple substitution cipher on the digits 0-9.
