Abstract: As part of NIST/ARPAs TREC Workshop, we used Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) for filtering 336k incoming documents from diverse sources (newswires, patents technical abstracts) for 50 topics of interest. We developed representations of user interests, or filters, for these topics using two sources of training information. A Word Filter used just the words in the topic statements, and a RelDocs Filter used just the known relevant training documents and ignored the topic statement. Using the relevant training documents (a variant of relevance feedback) was more effective than using a detailed natural language description of interests. Combining these two vectors provided some additional improvements in filtering. On average, 7 of the top 10 documents and 44 of the top 100 documents are relevant using the combined vector method. Data combination using the results of the Word and RelDocs retrieval sets was not generally successful in improving performance compared to the best individual method, although we believe it might be if additional sources are used. These combination methods are quite general and applicable to a variety of filtering and feedback applications.

Reference-contexts: An LSI model which combines the initial topic description with relevant training documents is quite effective. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) LSI is a variant of vector retrieval in which the dependencies between terms are explicitly taken into account <ref> (see Deerwester et al., 1990 for mathematical details and examples) </ref>. Most retrieval models (e.g., Boolean, stan dard vector, probabilistic) treat words as if they are independent, although it is quite obvious that they are not (Salton & McGill, 1983).

Reference-contexts: Most retrieval models (e.g., Boolean, stan dard vector, probabilistic) treat words as if they are independent, although it is quite obvious that they are not <ref> (Salton & McGill, 1983) </ref>. The central theme of LSI is that important inter-relationships among terms can be automatically derived, explicitly modeled, and used to improve retrieval. LSI uses singular-value decomposition (SVD), a statistical technique closely related to eigenvector decomposition, to model the associative relationships.
