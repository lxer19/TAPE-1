Abstract: Internet transmission and switching facilities are partitioned into different administrative domains. To effect routing between domains, domain border routers establish pairwise peering sessions and exchange routing information at exchange points. When a large number of border routers attach at an exchange point, significant operational coordination is necessary to maintain routing consistency. An alternative arrangement, in which each border router at an exchange point peers only with a Route Server, reduces the necessary coordination and provides other significant benefits. From a set-theoretic characterization of border router behavior, we derive a set-theoretic expression that completely and succinctly characterizes Route Server functionality. Performance measurements from our Route Server implementation reveal that the storage requirements of Route Servers can be much larger than that of a typical border router. We discuss a variety of techniques that can, in some instances, reduce Route Server storage requirements by a factor of five or more.

Reference-contexts: An alternative mechanism for injecting external routes into OSPF uses a single "route server" which, configured with domain policy, performs the same function. This use of the route server simplifies domain routing configuration. The RIPE Route Server <ref> [1] </ref> is a precursor to our RS. RIPE's Route Server is also designed to compute inter-domain routing tables, on behalf of domain BRs attached to an exchange point.

Reference-contexts: By slightly relaxing the condition for functional equivalence, it is possible to extend the view decomposition techniques to further reduce RS storage requirements; the paper does not discuss such approaches. The RS described in this paper is just one component of the Routing Arbiter architecture <ref> [4] </ref> for Internet inter-domain routing. Other complementary components include an Internet-wide Routing Registry, which contains connectivity and policy information from all constituent domains, and an Internet Network Operations Center. The Routing Arbiter architecture ensures stable and easily analyzable Internet routing, without compromising domain autonomy.

Reference-contexts: An IDPR "route server" computes this source route on behalf of a "client" domain, using global link-state topology information. Unlike an IDPR route server, our RS computes hop-by-hop routing tables satisfying its client domains' policy requirements. Like IDPR, the Unified inter-domain routing architecture <ref> [5] </ref> also uses the term "route server" to denote an entity that computes domain-level source routes (or fragments thereof) on behalf of domain BRs. <p> The Routing Arbiter architecture ensures stable and easily analyzable Internet routing, without compromising domain autonomy. As described in Section 8, our RS can also be used to compute specialized domain-level source routes or source-route fragments in the Unified <ref> [5] </ref> architecture. Apart from using the path vectors contained in IDRP routes for this purpose, the RS can also compute these specialized source routes directly from information maintained in the Routing Arbiter Routing Registry.

Reference-contexts: The term "route server" is also used, in a slightly different sense, in the OSPF intra-domain routing protocol specification <ref> [10] </ref>. In OSPF, domain BRs inject external routing information into intra-domain routing. Domain policies, usually configured into each domain BR, govern this dissemination of external routing information into OSPF.
