Abstract: The paper contains results of a research project aimed at application and evaluation of modern data analysis techniques in the field of marketing. The investigated techniques were: neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, CHAID and logistic regression analysis. All techniques were applied to the problem of making optimal selections for direct mailing and the resulting models were compared w.r.t. accuracy, interpretability, transparency and time and expertise needed for their construction.

Evolutionary Algorithms (EA's) form a class of adaptive search techniques that has been extensively investigated in recent years; [2], [6] and [8]. EAs are stochastic generate-and-test search methods based on a population of candidate solutions (individuals), each being assigned a heuristic quality measure, the f itness value.

Neural networks (or more precisely: artificial neural networks) are less traditional. A neural network is a network of processing elements, called neurons, or units.

The algorithm stops when a solution with an optimal fitness is found or a pre-specified stop-criterion is met. The evolutionary technique used in our research is genetic programming, <ref> [6] </ref>, where parse trees of mathematical formulas or programs representing prediction models are used as individuals.
