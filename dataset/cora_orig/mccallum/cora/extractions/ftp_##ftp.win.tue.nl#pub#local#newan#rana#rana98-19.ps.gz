Abstract: A method is described for the synchronization of nonlinear discrete time dynamics. The methodology consists of constructing observer-receiver dynamics that exploit at each time instant the drive signal and buffered past values of the drive signal. In this way, the method can be viewed as a dynamic reconstruction mechanism, in contrast to existing static inversion methods from the theory of dynamical systems.

Reference-contexts: It is interesting to note that an alternative using look-up tables for this procedure was proposed in [11]. The proposed transmitter/receiver synchronization using a receiver of the form (6) can be demonstrated numerically on several examples from the literature, see e.g. <ref> [3, 10] </ref>. In this paper, we will, amongst others, consider the example from [3]. The present paper is an expanded version of the paper [7].

In the next section we derive conditions under which a discrete time system admits a so called extended observer form. <p> We conclude this section with two examples. As a first example, consider the transmitter system x 1 (k+1) = (1*)x 1 (k)(1x 1 (k)) + * x 2 (k) (20) presented by Badola et al. in <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Note that (20) represents two weakly coupled logistic equations, each of them exhibiting chaotic behavior. Following <ref> [3] </ref>, x 2 (k) and x 3 (k) do not synchronize for these parameters and x 3 (0) = ^x 2 (0) = 0:7 while the observers obtained here show satisfactory behavior. <p> Moreover, the eigenvalues of the observer error dynamics and consequently the convergence rate are selectable. For synchronization as presented in <ref> [3] </ref>, one is neither able to guarantee synchronization nor able to influence the number of steps until synchronizations occurs. 4 Concluding remarks We have presented a control perspective on synchronization of discrete time transmitter systems. <p> Contrary to <ref> [3] </ref>, our results are valid no matter how the initial conditions are chosen. The observer viewpoint on the synchronization problem has also been advocated for continuous time systems, see [13], but the scheme as we used here in discrete time has no direct analogue in continuous time.

Reference-contexts: It turns out that under fairly weak conditions receiver dynamics (6) exist such that the transmitter (1,2) and the receiver (6) synchronize, see Section 3. Actually, the necessary conditions involved are closely related with global observability, cf. <ref> [12] </ref>, or, the Takens-Aeyels-Sauer Reconstruction Theorem, see [17],[1],[2],[16],[14].

Reference-contexts: For that reason several attempts for achieving synchronization of signals like x 2 () and ~x 2 () have been proposed. In particular we like to recall the (reduced) observer viewpoint advocated in <ref> [13] </ref> which basically admits the construction of dynamics ~x 2 (k+1) = ~ f 2 (x 1 (k); ~x 2 (k)): (5) such that (4) holds, whatever initial conditions (1), (2) and (5) have. <p> We will do this using a suitably selected dynamics of the form (6) which basically means that we treat the synchronization problem as an observer problem, cf. <ref> [13] </ref>. Without loss of generality we can assume that f (0) = 0 and h (0) = 0. <p> Contrary to [3], our results are valid no matter how the initial conditions are chosen. The observer viewpoint on the synchronization problem has also been advocated for continuous time systems, see <ref> [13] </ref>, but the scheme as we used here in discrete time has no direct analogue in continuous time. An obvious way to proceed in continuous time therefore could exist in (fast) sampling of the continuous time transmitter and then design a discrete time observer as receiver.

Reference-contexts: receiver now corresponds to the asymptotic matching of (2) and (3), that is lim kx 2 (k) ~x 2 (k)k = 0: (4) Clearly (4) will not be satisfied in general and, in fact, conditions on f 1 and f 2 that guarantee this condition are only partially known, cf. <ref> [14] </ref>. For that reason several attempts for achieving synchronization of signals like x 2 () and ~x 2 () have been proposed.
