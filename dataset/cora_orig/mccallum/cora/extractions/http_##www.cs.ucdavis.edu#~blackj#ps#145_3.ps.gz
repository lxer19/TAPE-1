Abstract: Properties: . We want the number of 4-digit integers using only the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Since each digit can be selected 5 different ways, the multiplication rule tells us the answer is 5 5 5 5 or 625. Properties: fag. Here we consider the same problem with digits being distinct. We can choose the thousands digit in 5 different ways, then the hundreds digit can be chosen in 4 different ways, then tens digit in 3 different ways, and the units digit in 2 different ways. So the total possible 4-digit integers is 5 4 3 2 or 120. Properties: fbg. Now we consider only even numbers. As we've seen in class and in the text, it's often best to consider the most-restricted digit first. So first consider the number of ways we can select the units digit. Clearly, it must be 2 or 4 to make our integer even, so there are 2 ways of selecting it. Each of the 3 remaining digits can be chosen in 5 ways since we're allowed to repeat digits. So again the multiplication rule yields 2 5 5 5 or 250. Properties: fa; bg. Finally we count all even 4-digit integers whose digits are distinct. Again, the units digit can be selected 2 ways. Now the thousands digit can be chosen in 4 ways, the hundreds digit in 3 ways, and the tens digit in 2 ways. The multiplication rule yields 2 4 3 2 or 48.
