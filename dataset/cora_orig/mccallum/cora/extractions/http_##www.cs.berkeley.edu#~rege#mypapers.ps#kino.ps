Abstract: Planning time-optimal motions has been a major focus of research in robotics. In this paper, we consider the following problem : Given an object in two-dimensional physical space, an initial point and a final point, plan a time-optimal obstacle-avoiding motion for this object subject to bounds on the velocity and acceleration of the object. We give the first algorithm which solves the problem exactly in the case where the velocity and acceleration bounds are given in the L 1 norm. We further prove the following important results : A tracking lemma and a loop elimination theorem both of which are applicable to the case of arbitrary norms. The latter result implies that, with or without obstacles, a path which intersects itself can be replaced by one which does not do so and which takes time less than or equal to that taken by the original path.

Reference-contexts: Not much is known about lower bounds for finding an exact solution in the 2D case. There is an extensive literature on time-optimal trajectory planning subject to different constraints.

Other work attempts to characterize the time-optimal solutions analytically [Hol, Sch]. Several approximation algorithms have been proposed for time-optimal motion planning. Sahar and Hollerbach [SH] and Shiller and Dubowsky [SD] provide approximation algorithms for robots with several degrees of freedom and full dynamics.

Reference-contexts: There are several other open problems within the broad framework of kinodynamic planning. One of the most interesting problems, from both theoretical and practical viewpoints, is that of generating time-optimal motions for nonholonomic systems, i.e. systems for which the dynamical constraints are not integrable <ref> [BL] </ref>. [JRL] consider the problem of generating time-optimal motions for an Hilare-like mobile robot (i.e. a robot with two independently controlled wheels). The form of time-optimal trajectories for such systems, even without obstacles, is not known at present.

Reference-contexts: These approaches use grid methods to compute approximate solutions but they do not bound the goodness of the approximation. Further, these algorithms run in time exponential in the number of grid points. The first polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the two and three dimensional cases was provided in <ref> [CDRX] </ref>. More specifically, they provide an algorithm which finds a "safe" trajectory which takes time (1 + *) times the time for an optimal trajectory. <p> It is therefore worth comparing our method with numerical approximation schemes such as <ref> [CDRX] </ref> or [JHCP] for the minimum time problem. It could be argued that we could use such a grid-based approximation algorithm (which normally runs in polynomial time on a polynomially large grid) and run it on an exponentially large grid to get an equivalent solution. <p> the exact method of this paper and a numerical approximation approach : (i) The first difference is that the path (s) the exact method would find is (are) the actual minimum-time path (s) whereas the numerical approach makes no such guarantees; the path found by the numerical approach as in <ref> [CDRX] </ref> need not even be homotopic to the minimum-time path. (ii) The second difference is that the grid-based approach is restricted to points which lie on the grid and as such is limited by the resolution of the grid.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the motion must obey a bound on the acceleration. A polynomial time exact algorithm is provided for this problem.

Reference-contexts: This problem has been considered previously in the literature and approximation algorithms have been provided for the two and three dimensional cases ([CDRX],[JHCP]) but with the exception of the one-dimensional case <ref> [O] </ref>, no exact algorithms have been given. In this paper, we provide the first exact algorithm for time-optimal kinodynamic motion planning in the two-dimensional case. 2 The Problem Statement Consider two-dimensional physical space, i.e. &lt; 2 , with polygonal obstacles. <p> The time of solution is a. And a time-optimal solution to the given problem is a solution such that the time is minimized. 3 Previous results The one-dimensional case is studied in <ref> [O] </ref>. The problem solved there is planning the motion of a particle moving on the real line such that given two "pursuit" functions f (t) and g (t), the position function, say x (t), satisfies f (t) x (t) g (t) for all t.

Can the above approach be extended to the case of arbitrary norms, especially the L 2 norm? (See <ref> [RT] </ref> for work in this direction.) We have shown how to eliminate loops for arbitrary norms; the main problem now is characterizing the time-optimal solutions. 4. Exact algorithms for the three-dimensional case.
