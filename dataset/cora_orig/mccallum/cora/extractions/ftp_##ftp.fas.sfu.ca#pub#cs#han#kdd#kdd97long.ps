Abstract: Metarule-guided mining is an interactive approach to data mining, where users probe the data under analysis by specifying hypotheses in the form of metarules, or pattern templates. Previous methods for metarule-guided mining of association rules have primarily used a transaction/relation table-based structure. Such approaches require costly, multiple scans of the data in order to find all the large itemsets. In this paper, we employ a novel approach to metarule-guided, multi-dimensional association rule mining which explores a data cube structure. We propose algorithms for metarule-guided mining using different cube structures: given a metarule containing p predicates, we compare mining on an n-dimensional cube structure (where p &lt; n) with mining on smaller multiple p-dimensional cubes. In addition, we propose an efficient method for precomputing the cube, which takes into account the constraints imposed by the given metarule. Our preliminary performance study shows that a cube-based metarule-guided algorithm for mining multi-dimensional association rules is efficient and can easily be extended to the mining of multilevel, multi-dimensional association rules.

The counts of the candidates in k-space are examined in order to find L k . Search continues until L p is found (since L p predicate sets are needed to generate rules complying with a metarule having p predicates).

Reference-contexts: If the layer itself is larger than the available main memory, the layer can be partitioned into chunks <ref> (Zhao et al. 1997) </ref> and only the corresponding chunks needs to be loaded for efficient computation. Rationale. Step 1 finds the large 1-predicate sets for each dimension A i by searching the 1-D space of the cube, which stores the occurrence frequency of each dimension value. <p> As in 1), only a subset of each cube is computed. When a data cube cannot fit in main memory, the proposed algorithms employ a cube chunking strategy, where the cube is broken up into smaller, memory-fit chunks. This method is similar to a recent study <ref> (Zhao et al. 1997) </ref> where a single- or multi-pass multiway aggregation is explored for efficient cube construction, depending on the available memory. Our proposed hierarchy-based chunking technique scans through the data cube in a single pass since it requires smaller memory space. <p> An efficient, array-based algorithm for simultaneous multidimensional aggregation has been studied recently <ref> (Zhao et al. 1997) </ref>. At any given time, at least one chunk is loaded into memory. The data cells of the chunk are scanned, and the corresponding summary layers of the data cube are updated. <p> Moreover, one scan of a chunk derives all of its summary layers, and these layers are sufficient for computing the summary layers of the entire cube. Therefore, a single pass through each chunk is sufficient for computing the entire cube. In comparison with the algorithm proposed by <ref> (Zhao et al. 1997) </ref>, although each chunk will be accessed only once, the subsequent computation of cube summary layers may need to fetch the summary layers of multiple chunks, which may cost I/O operations. <p> However, the ordering in which summary layers are computed can be explored, e.g., by computing some summary layers simultaneously if there is sufficient memory. Therefore, this hierarchy-based chunking and first computation of chunk summary layers is an interesting alternative to <ref> (Zhao et al. 1997) </ref> for cube computation. This is especially beneficial for meta-rule guided mining since only a few cube layers, such as p and m, need to be computed in rule mining.
