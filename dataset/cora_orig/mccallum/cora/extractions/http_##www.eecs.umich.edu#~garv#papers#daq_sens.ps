Reference-contexts: Sensor refers only to those parts of that produce an electrical signal as a function of electrical state. April 2, 1998 DRAFT 9 B. Necessity for Relative Quantities and Equations based on relative quantities The set of equations described in Section II-A were sufficient for Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>, where sensor performance was evaluated for a fixed receiver. This article's goal of comparing receiver performance mandates different analysis techniques. A standard problem encountered when making any direct measurement of forward, reverse voltage is illustrated in Figure 3. <p> Analysis of data in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref> provides the necessary information. In Ref. [28], a relationship between power error and error in measured forward and reverse voltage was clearly established. It is straight forward to determine errors in reflection coefficient magnitude (j j). <p> Analysis of data in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref> provides the necessary information. In Ref. [28], a relationship between power error and error in measured forward and reverse voltage was clearly established. It is straight forward to determine errors in reflection coefficient magnitude (j j). We observe that errors in (j j) are very closely correlated with errors in (V + , V ). <p> This suggests that the relative measurement of (j j) is representative of errors in (V + , V ). Similarly, for (v, i)- based measurement, data on errors in power calculated from voltage and current in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref> can be compared to errors in impedance, a relative quantity. Here again, the two are very closely correlated. In both the (V + , V ) and (v, i)- based cases, data from Ref. [28] indicate that error in relative measurement is representative of errors in electrical state. <p> i)- based measurement, data on errors in power calculated from voltage and current in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref> can be compared to errors in impedance, a relative quantity. Here again, the two are very closely correlated. In both the (V + , V ) and (v, i)- based cases, data from Ref. [28] indicate that error in relative measurement is representative of errors in electrical state. Given that errors in and Z are strongly correlated to errors in (V + , V )and (v, i), we need equations to relate these to calculated delivered power. <p> 1 s 22 2 If we assume that V + is exactly known, we can calculate delivered power and relative power April 2, 1998 DRAFT 11 error as a function of j j only: P = Z ffi * P = P j j 2 j j 2 In Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>, a relationship between power error, * P and measurement error, * jV j was derived, as expressed in Eq. (16): * P = vswr 2 * jV j = ( j V + j j V j j V j ): (16) The same result can be derived for relative <p> we measure is a load reflection coefficient, and calculate power based on an assumed constant j V + j, then (17) holds, and allows us to rewrite (15) as (18). * jV j = jj (17) vswr 2 Given that Eq. (15) is extensively supported by experimental data in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>, we can use Eq. (18) to simplify data analysis. In evaluating receiver performance, we are interested in determining the error in delivered power at a variety of test loads. We can simplify data analysis by taking the root mean square of the electrical state error expressed as jj . <p> EXPERIMENTAL SETUP Experiments in this article were performed in the manner described in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>. Test loads are excited with low power signals using a network analyzer. A high power probe is used, whose output is a pair of voltage signals proportional to the electrical state at the measurement point (the sensor reference plane). These voltage signals are then received by various instruments. <p> Accordingly, each load VSWR was achieved with four different : high impedance capacitive, low impedance capacitive, low impedance inductive and high impedance inductive. All test loads are formed of reactive elements in series or parallel with a April 2, 1998 DRAFT 14 matched load, as in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>. In order to generate additional test points, the high VSWR test loads (25 and 75) were used with additional lengths of transmission line of one, two and four feet. The impedance of the test loads, as determined by vector network analyzer measurement is shown in Figure 4. <p> D. Experimental Method Once the evaluation of external receiver performance by means of relative measurements is determined as the goal of the research, the test configuration follows. For all external receivers, reference mode and measurement mode (as defined in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>) can be performed simultaneously. Figure 5 shows this test configuration, which will be referred to as external mode. <p> This approach, although slightly more tedious to set up, has the advantage of determining or Z with a single measurement, as opposed to the ratio of two transmission measurements as was the case in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>. E. Standard Probe Calibration It is standard practice to assume that the output of the sensor is related to the electrical state by a simple multiplication or `calibration factor'. <p> As is illustrated in Figure 1, the sensor reference plane is somewhere in the middle of the probe. As indicated in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>, the matrix square root of the ABCD matrix model of the probe is an accurate approximation of the network between load reference plane and sensor reference plane. <p> The dominant factor affecting the higher errors in (v, i)- based measurement is felt to be due to the natural deviation from the calibration point of the (v, i)- based measurement. As described in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>, as VSWR increases, the signals in (V + , V )- based measurement approach the value at which the calibration was developed, and thus are more likely to be accurate. <p> It is interesting to note that in this experiment, de-embedding reduces errors in vector network analyzer based measurements, whereas it had essentially no effect on these measurements in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>. This is most likely attributed to the change in measurement technique. In Ref. [28], measurements were made using the S-parameter test set, and thus impedances were determined from two separate measurements, making the possibility of error higher. <p> It is interesting to note that in this experiment, de-embedding reduces errors in vector network analyzer based measurements, whereas it had essentially no effect on these measurements in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>. This is most likely attributed to the change in measurement technique. In Ref.

In the present set of experiments, impedance was determined directly and, as can be seen from the results, with lower errors. B. <p> In order understand the limitations of the standard de-embedding process and to determine a better method, error modeling must be considered it more detail.

The magnitude of errors appears less critical than their type. We observed errors on the order of 30% due to a lossy network in Ref. <ref> [28] </ref>, and here errors on the order of 10% due to the power meter's receiving function. The larger error due to a lossy network is linear, and easily correctable. The error due to the power meter's receiving function is nonlinear. <p> Further improvements are possible using a dual channel power meter, which reduces relative error, and with more complex non linear correction as developed in <ref> [28] </ref>. Although error correction is definitely feasible, the amount of effort required to generate an accurate map of receiver gain as a function of input levels is a daunting task.

Reference-contexts: Once the network impedances are determined, an S-parameter matrix representation is easily derived, using standard equations <ref> [29] </ref>. In this article, all networks are assumed to be reciprocal. The term `network model' is used to refer to a model with the same mathematical formulation as a reciprocal network. <p> Accordingly, we cannot determine the actual forward voltage,V + lrp , and thus cannot determine how much of the difference in Eq. (10) is due to Eq. (11) and how much is due to measurement error. This problem has long been familiar to vector network analyzer designers <ref> [29] </ref> and is a motivating factor behind making all vector network analyzer measurements relative to the incident wave (V + ).

Reference-contexts: This domain is representative of typical processing plasmas, and improved performance over this restricted domain is likely to be sufficient. The procedure is to select a small number of loads and perform a linear least squares <ref> [30] </ref> fit relating measured state to actual state. The least squares procedure generates the best linear model of the relation between measured and actual values. It should be noted that the least squares approach involves a more complex procedure.
