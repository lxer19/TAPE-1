Abstract: Networks Of Workstations (NOW) are an emerging architecture capable of supporting parallel processing with significantly low cost/performance ratio. At the moment the implementation of standard high-level communication mechanisms in a NOW does not provide such a satisfactory cost/performance ratio, as modern communication hardware would allow. We show how a standard, Unix-like operating system kernel can be extended with efficient and performant low-level communication primitives based on the Active Message communication paradigm. Higher level standard communication libraries, like MPI, should be implemented on top of such efficient low-level mechanisms. We provide some preliminary results obtained from an experimental prototype called GAMMA (Genoa Active Message MAchine), which is a NOW whose nodes run the operating system Linux 2.0 enhanced with an Active Message communication layer.

Reference-contexts: A well known application of Active Messages as an efficient support to parallel processing is the Active Message Layer introduced by Thinking Machines Co. in the CM-5 platform <ref> [1] </ref>. The same idea has been followed by the FM project [2], using a fast LAN called Myrinet instead of the Fat Tree interconnection network of the CM-5.

Our modest yet original contribution to the idea of exploiting Active Messages for efficient parallel processing is the application to a cheap platform which exploits only off-the-shelf and cheap hardware devices.

Reference-contexts: Ping-pong application: comparison of platforms. hot cache. We observed that half the bandwidth is ex-ploited already with messages as short as 32 bytes. Using results provided by our collegues working on the PARMA 2 Project <ref> [3, Table 2.1] </ref> we can compare the performance of ping-pong on GAMMA with the performance of ping-pong on other platforms. Table 1 reports some of the results obtained by the PARMA 2 group in which the GAMMA results are integrated.

Reference-contexts: The best approach to efficient parallel processing in a NOW is to design and implement efficient low-level interprocess communication primitives from scratch, and use these primitives to build higher-level communication mechanisms, like those of MPI <ref> [4] </ref>, which would still enjoy a significant fraction of the raw communication performances. We have built an extremely cheap NOW prototype called GAMMA (Genoa Active Message MAchine) equipped with an efficient interprocess communication layer based on the paradigm of Active Messages [6].

Reference-contexts: In order to experiment this idea we also chose a standard operating system for which source code is freely available, namely Linux. A somehow similar approach was followed also by researchers at Cornell University in the framework of the U-net project <ref> [5] </ref>. U-net follows the idea of removing communication support from the OS kernel in order to re-implement it (more efficiently) at the user application level. A pre-defined number of virtual "end points" are multiplexed over the physical adapter. <p> This way a virtualization of fast communication devices directly accessible by user processes is obtained which does not require any system call to send messages. An Active Message layer was implemented on top of such virtual fast communication devices. Both an ATM <ref> [5] </ref> and a Fast Ethernet [7] version of U-net were released. 4. Performance Measurements We carried out some preliminary performance measures on a GAMMA equipped with a two PCs. A more extensive benchmarking is in progress. <p> However we do not expect the overhead of the MPI implementation over GAMMA to increase message latency in a substantial way. The comparisons with CM-5 CMAML and the U-net emulation of Active Messages <ref> [5] </ref> appear instead to be fair. In the case of U-net data are desumed from the cited paper and the hardware platform is constituted by 60 MHz SuperSPARCs connected by 140 MHz ATM. 5.

Reference-contexts: We have built an extremely cheap NOW prototype called GAMMA (Genoa Active Message MAchine) equipped with an efficient interprocess communication layer based on the paradigm of Active Messages <ref> [6] </ref>. GAMMA is a network of 12 Intel Pentium PCs connected by a 100 Mb/s Fast Ethernet LAN. Each workstation runs Linux 2.0 enhanced with a custom device driver and Active Messages communication primitives. <p> However in neither cases is the binding accomplished through an explicit connection protocol. Correctness and determinism of the communication topology induced by the port-to-port mapping is up to the programmer. 3. Related Work Active Messages were originally proposed by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley <ref> [6] </ref>, as a flexible and efficient low-level communication mechanism aimed at reducing communication overhead and allowing communication to overlap computation.
