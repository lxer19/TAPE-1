Abstract: For a target tracking task, the hand-held camera of the anthropomorphic OSCAR-robot manipulator has to track an object which moves arbitrarily on a table. The desired camera-joint mapping is approximated by a feedforward neural network. Through the use of time derivatives of the position of the object and of the manipulator, the controller can inherently predict the next position of the moving target object. In this paper several `anticipative' controllers are described, and successfully applied to track a moving object.

Reference-contexts: In order to position the camera above the object at a fixed distance, a feedforward network learns the camera-joint mapping. During operation, learning samples, one for each move, are obtained by the `input-adjustment-method' <ref> [2] </ref>. The learning samples are used to adapt the neural network. In the most simple case, the task is restricted to 2D movements with the camera always looking down from a constant altitude. <p> In order to build up a set of training samples for the networks, the `input-adjustment-method' <ref> [2] </ref> is used. The idea of the input-adjustment-method is to reconstruct those inputs that should have resulted in the desired performance. Suppose that one of the (not-perfect) networks F 0 , F 1 and F 2 generates the output ~ k at time step k.

Reference-contexts: Since the units in the first layer of our network are linear combiners followed by a sigmoid function, this theory holds also for our findings <ref> [3] </ref>. A measure of correlation is the spread of the eigenvalues max = min of the 8 correlation matrix R = E [~u~u T ] of the input vector ~u. The smaller the spread, the faster the network adapts.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In <ref> [5] </ref> a real-time learning neural controller is described for the control of the anthropomorphic OSCAR-robot manipulator. An object, which is placed arbitrarily on a table, is observed by a camera in the end-effector of the manipulator.

Reference-contexts: For the simulations the test-environment `Simderella' is used <ref> [6] </ref>. Two object movements on the table serve as test cases; one follows the `daisy'-trajectory and one a random trajectory. The daisy is a `epicyclical' trajectory: two superposed circular movements.

Reference-contexts: The weights of the networks are adapted on-line by a conjugate gradient optimisation technique <ref> [7] </ref>. The algorithm is performed over the set of training examples which is build up using the input-adjustment-method. Simulations are done for 1000 moves of the manipulator. Each move lasts 0.5 seconds. The manipulator is in principle fast enough to follow the object.

Reference-contexts: Figure 5 shows the learning curves of F 3 up to F 6 of one trial for the daisy test case. The fast convergence can be explained by the decorrelation of the inputs of the network. In general, decorrelating the inputs results in faster convergence for linear combiners <ref> [8] </ref>. This can be understood by noting that, if the inputs are strongly correlated, the combiner has to linearly combine a lot of redundant information, and will be slow in learning the statistics of the input data.
