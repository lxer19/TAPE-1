Abstract: Many applications require approximate values of path integrals. A typical approach is to approximate the path integral by a high dimensional integral and apply a Monte Carlo (randomized) algorithm. However, Monte Carlo algorithm requires roughly " 2 integrand evaluations to provide an "-approximation. Moreover, the error bound of " is guaranteed only in a stochastic sense. Do we really need to use randomized algorithms for path integrals? Perhaps, we can find a deterministic algorithm that is more effective even in the worst case setting. To answer this question, we study the worst case complexity of path integration, which, roughly speaking, is defined as the minimal number of the integrand evaluations needed to compute an approximation with error at most ". We consider path integration with respect to a Gaussian measure, and for various classes of integrands. Tractability of path integration means that the complexity depends polynomially on 1=". We show that for the class of r times Frechet differentiable integrands, tractability of path integration holds iff the covariance operator of the Gaussian measure has finite rank. Hence, if the Gaussian measure is supported on an infinite dimensional space then path integration is intractable. In this case, there exists no effective deterministic algorithm, and the use of randomized algorithms is justified. In fact, for this class of integrands, the classical Monte Carlo algorithm is (almost) optimal and the complexity in the randomized setting is proportional to " 2 .

Reference-contexts: Of course, c 1, and in many cases c is much larger than unity. The precise definition of comp ("; F ) can be found, e.g., in <ref> [8] </ref>. Here we only mention that in our case comp ("; F ) can be (roughly) defined as the minimal number of integrand evaluations needed to compute an approximation whose error is at most " for all f 2 F . <p> Without any assumption on the eigenvalues i , one can prove that the complexity comp ran ("; F r ) goes to infinity faster than " 2+ffi for any positive ffi. For the definition of the randomized setting see, e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>. The proof of the lower bound on the complexity uses results of [33] and [4] for the finite dimensional case, and the proof of Theorem 1. Proof of Theorem 1: We first prove (i). <p> We now show that this is not true. Let m n = m n (C r;d (D)) denote the minimal error of algorithms using n function values for the weighted integration problem (6) in the class C r;d (D). It is known, see e.g., <ref> [8] </ref> p. 58, that m n = inf sup Z g ( ~ t ) d ( ~ t ) d ~ t: Clearly, the above supremum will not increase if we additionally constrain g by adding g 0. <p> Due to Smolyak's theorem, see e.g., <ref> [8] </ref> p. 76, we know that the worst case error is minimized by a linear algorithm. Therefore we may assume that is linear, (f ) = P ~ i 2M a ~ i f (2 ~ i ) (0) for some weights a ~ i . <p> Since H d is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and both S d and are continuous linear functionals, the worst case error of is equal to the average case error of for a certain space and a certain measure, see e.g., <ref> [8] </ref> p. 304 and [35]. More precisely, there exists a separable Banach space B d of functions defined on IR d such that H d is a dense subset of B d .

Reference-contexts: This can be done in different ways. One of them is to consider a class of entire functions, i.e., functions with infinite smoothness r = +1, and this is the subject of Section 4. Another one will be reported in a forthcoming paper <ref> [31] </ref>. For completeness, we also consider the case where only k eigenvalues are positive. Then, as we shall see, the path integration problem becomes a k dimensional weighted integration problem and is tractable with exponent k=r.
