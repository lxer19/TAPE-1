Abstract: This paper presents an application of image based homing for the navigation of a wheelchair. It describes which information can be generated by comparing panoramic images and how this infor mation is used to cope with the kinematic restrictions of the wheelchair in figure 1.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it seems to make sense to search for methods that are less complicated. One possibility is to follow biological examples because even very "simple" animals are able to navigate very precisely. Cartwright and Collett <ref> [1, 2] </ref> analyzed the navigation of honeybees. They supposed that bees navigate with the help of "snapshots", i.e. simple images of the environment. The bees remember the exact position of the beehive and their food sources with these images.

Reference-contexts: Each of these pixels "looks" in a different direction. Therefore a pixel's position in the sequence corresponds to the angle that it is heading to. The Panama-algorithm (Panorama matching) presented here is a correlation based image processing method that calculates the optical flow field <ref> [3] </ref> between two of these images taken at different positions. The flow field is determined by matching the two images using neighborhood preservation for stabilization. This is inspired by Kohonen's [5] self organizing feature map but the neighborhood preservation is more strict.

Reference-contexts: This behavior is also called "homing". Lehrer [6] found that bees use color information for navigation tasks.

The whole process is performed under the assumption that the relative sequence of objects is exactly the same in both images [7].

The whole process is performed under the assumption that the relative sequence of objects is exactly the same in both images <ref> [7] </ref>. Mathematically panoramic pictures can be described as a vector I with n components that are the images' pixels p i . In the presented implementation the pixels consist of the color components red, green and blue.

Reference-contexts: The results show that the presented method is suitable for robot navigation although it is necessary that there are enough visual cues in the surroundings. In the future, the presented algorithm has to be combined with an obstacle avoidance method, as has been done for a simulated holonomic robot <ref> [8] </ref>.
