Abstract: The center of a connected graph G is the set of nodes of G for which the maximum distance to any other node of G is as small as possible. If G is a simply connected set of lattice points ("pixels") with graph structure defined by 4-neighbor adjacency, we show that the center of G is either a 2-by-2 square block, a diagonal staircase, or a (dotted) diagonal line with no gaps. The authors thank Fridrich Sloboda for suggesting the problem, Reinhard Klette for early discussions, and Janice Perrone for her help in preparing this paper.

Reference-contexts: introduction to this subject see <ref> [4] </ref>. Such sets arise when planar regions are digitized; they can be regarded as discrete approximations of these regions. <p> Analogous concepts of adjacency, paths, connectedness, etc. can be defined if we redefine neighbor to include the diagonal neighbors (i 1; j 1) of (i; j). A finite connected set of pixels S is called simply connected if its complement S is connected in the 8-neighbor sense <ref> [4] </ref>. [In general, S can be partitioned into a finite number of maximal 8-connected subsets, called its 8-connected components. Exactly one of these components is infinite; it is called the background of S. <p> Proof: Let ^ S be the union of the unit squares centered at the pixels of S. Since S is simply connected, the border B of ^ S is a simple closed curve. (B may touch itself at corners of squares, but the border following algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> unambiguously determines which sides of the edges of the squares are inside ^ S and which are outside.) Let L be the line segment joining the pixels of C, extended until it meets B (at the centers of the top and bottom edges of the unit squares centered at the
