Abstract: We study non-preemptive, online admission control in the hard deadline model: each job must be either serviced prior to its deadline, or be rejected. Our setting consists of a single resource that services an online sequence of jobs; each job has a length indicating the length of time for which it needs the resource, and a delay indicating the maximum time it can wait for the service to be started. The goal is to maximize total resource utilization. The jobs are non-preemptive and exclusive, meaning once a job begins, it runs to completion, and at most one job can use the resource at any time. We obtain a series of results, under varying assumptions of job lengths and delays, which are summarized in the following table.

The paper by Awerbuch, Bartal, Fiat, and Rosen [3] considers admission control for tree networks. Again, no delays are allowed, meaning a request must be either scheduled immediately or rejected. They present a general technique called "classify-and-randomly-select" that randomly selects a bandwidth b, length `, and benefit f , all of which are powers of 2. <p> While our algorithm is similar to the Marriage Algorithm of Lipton and Tomkins [12], our analysis is completely different. Note that the classify-and-randomly-select paradigm <ref> [3] </ref> in this case would just pick one randomly selected length to schedule. Our approach, in contrast, seems much more reasonable in practice: though there is a bias in favor of longer jobs, shorter length jobs also have a chance of being scheduled.

(By appropriate scaling, we can assume that the shortest job has length one. <p> It is easy to see that there are instances (a large number of jobs arriving at roughly the same time, but each with a large allowable delay) where the optimal solution with delays is significantly better than that with no delays. While Feldmann et. al <ref> [7] </ref> show that there are worst-case inputs where delay does not help, we believe that in practice delay will help increase the resource utilization significantly. Finally, we extend our results to jobs of multiple lengths. <p> Allowing users to specify a maximum delay would eliminate such behavior. Our algorithm is also more natural for real-life use since it does not pre-select the lengths of the requests to accept. Finally, Feldmann et. al <ref> [7] </ref> consider scheduling jobs with delays for a network that is a linear array of n nodes. They show that in some cases fixed length delays do not help.
