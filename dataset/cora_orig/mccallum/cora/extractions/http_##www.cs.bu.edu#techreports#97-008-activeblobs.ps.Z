Abstract: A new region-based approach to nonrigid motion tracking is described. Shape is defined in terms of a deformable triangular mesh that captures object shape plus a color texture map that captures object appearance. Photometric variations are also modeled. Nonrigid shape registration and motion tracking are achieved by posing the problem as an energy-based, robust minimization procedure. The approach provides robustness to occlusions, wrinkles, shadows, and specular highlights. The formulation is tailored to take advantage of texture mapping hardware available in many workstations, PC's, and game consoles. This enables nonrigid tracking at speeds approaching video rate.

To deform the model, we deform this mesh. Nonrigid deformation of the mesh can be specified in terms of parametric functions; e.g., affine deformations, eight parameter projective deformations, application-specific deformations <ref> [3] </ref>, finite element modal deformations [22, 28], or principal deformations derived from a statistical analysis over a training set of shapes [9, 20, 21]. The blob's appearance is then captured as a color texture map and applied directly to the triangulated model. <p> Unfortunately, these functions are only suitable for approximating the rigid motion of a planar patch. The functions can be extended to include linear and quadratic polynomials <ref> [3] </ref>; however, the extended formulation cannot model general nonrigid motion. 3.1 Finite Element Modes A more general parameterization of nonrigid motion can be obtained via the use of the modal representation [22]. In the modal representation, deformation is represented in terms of eigenvectors of a finite element (FE) model.

Active blobs employ a texture-mapped triangular mesh model for tracking deforming shapes in color images. <p> Despite the use of graphics hardware in accelerating this calculation, this is still the performance bottleneck, and therefore an algorithm that decreases the number of gradient calculations is needed. As an alternative, we can use a difference decomposition approach <ref> [12] </ref>. The approach offers the benefit that it requires the equivalent O (1) image gradient calculations and O (N ) image products per iteration. In the difference decomposition, we define a basis of difference images generated by adding small changes to each of the blob parameters.

Reference-contexts: The same principles hold true for regularization [6, 33], where the energies of a physical model can be related directly with measurement and prior probabilities used in Bayesian estimation <ref> [30] </ref>. Rather than modeling the system as an elastic material, we can instead assume nothing about it, collect data samples of the displacements of each node, and then perform a principal components analysis [9, 20, 21].

Reference-contexts: Such approaches provide a low-dimensional characterization of shape that enables recognition and comparison of nonrigid motions. Another promising family of approaches is based on correlation of deforming image patches <ref> [3, 15, 21, 32] </ref>. These approaches integrate information over an image region, and therefore tend to be more immune to noise and/or low-contrast, especially if a robust estimator formulation is employed [4]. <p> These approaches integrate information over an image region, and therefore tend to be more immune to noise and/or low-contrast, especially if a robust estimator formulation is employed [4]. To date, most correlation-based models for nonrigid motion require off-line processing, though multi-scale techniques offer some hope for realtime performance <ref> [15, 32] </ref>. Real-time approaches for tracking of parameterized patches have been developed [12, 13]; however, these methods do not address general nonrigid motion tracking. 1.2 New Approach: Active Blobs To address the general nonrigid tracking problem, we will introduce a new deformable model formulation: active blobs. <p> Perhaps the simplest warping functions to be used in Eq. 2 are those of a 2D affine model or an eight parameter projective model <ref> [15, 32] </ref>. Unfortunately, these functions are only suitable for approximating the rigid motion of a planar patch.

Reference-contexts: As will be explained in the next section, strain energy can be used to enforce the prior probabilities on the shape's deformations. 3.2 Statistical Modes As has been pointed out by Terzopoulos <ref> [33] </ref>, and by others [7, 8, 20], there is a well understood link between physically-motivated deformable models and statistical estimation. <p> Splines were perhaps some of the first physically-based models employed in statistical estimation [19]; they are particularly well-suited to modeling data sampled from a Markov Random Field (MRF), with Gaussian noise added [11]. The same principles hold true for regularization <ref> [6, 33] </ref>, where the energies of a physical model can be related directly with measurement and prior probabilities used in Bayesian estimation [30].

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, it was difficult to use snakes for recognition because of differences in sampling and parameterization in comparing recovered descriptions. This led to the development of algorithms that enforce a priori constraints on the types of allowable deformations for motion tracking [5, 10], deformable templates <ref> [16, 34, 36] </ref>, trainable snakes [2, 9], and deformable prototypes [27]. Such approaches provide a low-dimensional characterization of shape that enables recognition and comparison of nonrigid motions.
