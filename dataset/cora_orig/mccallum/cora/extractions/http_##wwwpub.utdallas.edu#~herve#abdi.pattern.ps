Title: Connectionist models of face  
Note: processing 29  
Abstract: About the author - Alice J. O'Toole received a B.A. in Psychology and Philosophy from The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. in 1983. She received an M.S. and a Ph.D. from Brown University in 1985 and 1988, respectively. She completed a 2 year postdoctoral fellowship at the Universite de Bourgogne and the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications, France. She is presently an assistant professor in the School of Human Development at The University of Texas at Dallas. Her research interests include human memory for faces, computational models of face perception and stereoscopic vision. About the author Garrison Cottrell received a BS in Mathematics and Sociology in 1972 and a MAT in Mathematics Education in 1975 at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY. He received an M.S. in 1981 and a Ph.D. in 1985 in Computer Science at the University of Rochester. He was an NIMH post-doctoral fellow at the Center for Human Information Processing at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) between 1985-87 and is currently an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at UCSD. His research interests include connectionist models of cognitive processes, especially language processing and procedural learning, parallel distributed processing, image compression, modeling of invertebrate circuits, and non-monotonic reasoning.
