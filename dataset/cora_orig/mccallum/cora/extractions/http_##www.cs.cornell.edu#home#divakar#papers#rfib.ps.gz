Abstract: For the familiar Fibonacci sequence | defined by f 1 = f 2 = 1, and f n = f n1 + f n2 for n &gt; 2 | f n increases exponentially with n at a rate given by the golden ratio (1 + for a simple modification with both additions and subtractions | the random Fibonacci sequences defined by t 1 = t 2 = 1, and for n &gt; 2, t n = t n1 t n2 , where each sign is independent and either + or with probability 1=2 | it is not even obvious if jt n j should increase with n. Our main result is that with probability 1. Finding the number 1:13198824 : : : involves the theory of random matrix products, Stern-Brocot division of the real line, a fractal-like measure, a computer calculation, and a rounding error analysis to validate the computer calculation. p

Reference-contexts: color theorem (all planar graphs can be colored using only four colors so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color) by Appel, Haken and Koch caused controversy and aroused great interest because it relied on producing and checking 1834 graphs using 1200 hours of 1976 computer time [25] <ref> [2] </ref>. In spite of improvements (for example, the number 1834 was brought down to 1482 soon afterwards by Appel and Haken themselves), all proofs of the four color theorem still rely on the computer. Computer assisted proofs are more common now.

Directions x can be parameterized using angles, x = sin with 2 (=2; =2], or using slopes, x = m with m 2 (1; 1]. <p> The measure -f is the unique invariant probability measure over x for this random walk, i.e., 1 -f (A 1 S) + 2 where S is any Borel measurable set of directions. We also say that -f is f -invariant. For the existence and uniqueness of -f , see <ref> [6, p. 10, p. 32] </ref>. It 7 is also known that -f must be continuous [6, p. 32], i.e., -f (fxg) = 0 for any fixed direction x. <p> We also say that -f is f -invariant. For the existence and uniqueness of -f , see [6, p. 10, p. 32]. It 7 is also known that -f must be continuous <ref> [6, p. 32] </ref>, i.e., -f (fxg) = 0 for any fixed direction x. <p> The reason is -f is obviously a continuous measure, every rational appears in the Stern-Brocot tree at a finite depth by Lemma 3.1c, and the rationals are dense in R. For the uniqueness of -f , see <ref> [6, p. 31] </ref>. It is enough to prove the invariance condition for positive intervals rff. The validity of the invariance condition for negative Stern-Brocot intervals follows from symmetry. <p> To show that -f is a fractal, it is necessary to prove that 0 &lt; dim (-f ) &lt; 1. While it is known that 0 &lt; dim (-f ) <ref> [6, p. 162] </ref>, a proof that dim (-f ) &lt; 1 or that -f is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure does not seem to be available though those statements are almost surely true. <p> However, the Hausdorff dimensions of very similar measures have been determined by Kinney and Pitcher [24]. We also note Ledrappier's conjecture that dim (-f ) &lt; 1 [27] <ref> [6, p. 162] </ref>. 4 e Furstenberg's integral for fl f (2.3) can be written as fl f = 2 0 4 1 + 4m 4 because both the integrand and fare symmetric about 0.

Reference-contexts: Our computation uses floating point arithmetic which is inexact owing to rounding errors. Thus it becomes necessary to bound the effect of the rounding errors, which we do in the appendix. An early example of rigorous use of floating point arithmetic is due to Brent <ref> [8] </ref>. Lanford's proof of Feigenbaum's conjecture about the period doubling route to chaos used interval arithmetic [26]. The computer assisted proof of chaos in the Lorenz equations announced by Mischaikow and Mrozek [29] is an other notable example, though the full details of the error analysis are still unpublished.

When it exists, that limit is usually denoted by fl and called the upper Lyapunov exponent.

In fact, the random Fi-bonacci recurrence in a more general form appears as a motivating example in the very first paragraph of Furstenberg's famous paper <ref> [16] </ref>. In Section 2, we present a formula for fl f due to Furstenberg that forms the basis for this paper.

Reference-contexts: Thus if a is a real number in the range [2 1022 ; (1 + 2 1 + + 2 52 )2 1023 ], a can be represented such that fl (a) = a (1 + E) with the relative error E satisfying jEj &lt; 2 52 <ref> [20, p. 42] </ref>. The IEEE standard treats +; ; fi; ffi; p as basic operations. The basic operations cannot always be performed exactly. For example, the sum of two floating point numbers may not have an exact floating point representation. <p> (p d ) p d j &lt; 4 33 ue u (d+1) ; log 4 (e u (d+1) 1) + 4 In the theorem below, by 1:13198824 : : : we mean a number in the interval [1:13198824; 1:13198825). 1 The bounds on jEj can be taken as 2 53 <ref> [20, p. 42] </ref>, but with the current choice the relative error of Tang's log function (see (4.4)) has the same bound as that of the basic operations. 19 Theorem 4.2.

Reference-contexts: Since the proof of Theorem 4.2 relies on a computer calculation, the validity of the proof requires some comment.

For a description of the numerical method, sometimes called Ulam's method, see <ref> [21] </ref>. 2, the program and the rounding error analysis given in the appendix can all be checked line by line. However, Theorem 4.2 still assumes the correct implementation of various software and hardware components including the standard IEEE-754.

Reference-contexts: If fl (e) denotes the number obtained by evaluating the expression e in floating point arithmetic, fl (e) depends both on the type of floating point arithmetic used and the algorithm used to evaluate e. Our computations using IEEE double precision arithmetic <ref> [22] </ref> and an algorithm described in the appendix gave fl (p 28 ) = 0:1239755981508; fl (q 28 ) = 0:1239755994406: (4.2) In hexadecimal code, the 64 bits of fl (p d ) and fl (q d ) in IEEE double precision format are 3fbfbcdd638f4d87 and 3fbfbcdd6919756d respectively. <p> We will now upper bound the errors jfl (p 28 ) p 28 j and jfl (q 28 ) q 28 j to realize our aim of obtaining bounds for fl f from (4.2).

Reference-contexts: In spite of the importance of the upper Lyapunov exponent fl , fl is known exactly for very few examples. Kingman, one of the pioneers of subadditive ergodic theory of which the theory of random matrix products is a special case, wrote <ref> [23, 1973] </ref>: Pride of place among the unsolved problems of subadditive er godic theory must go to the calculation of the constant fl ( : : : ). <p> Applications have been made to areas as diverse as Schrodinger operators, image generation, and demography 6 [13][14][36].

Reference-contexts: four color theorem (all planar graphs can be colored using only four colors so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color) by Appel, Haken and Koch caused controversy and aroused great interest because it relied on producing and checking 1834 graphs using 1200 hours of 1976 computer time <ref> [25] </ref> [2]. In spite of improvements (for example, the number 1834 was brought down to 1482 soon afterwards by Appel and Haken themselves), all proofs of the four color theorem still rely on the computer. Computer assisted proofs are more common now.

Reference-contexts: Thus it becomes necessary to bound the effect of the rounding errors, which we do in the appendix. An early example of rigorous use of floating point arithmetic is due to Brent [8].

Reference-contexts: One of the applications Kingman refers to is the general problem of finding fl for random matrix products. For this and other applications, Kingman's problem is still unsolved. Bougerol [6, p. 33], Lima and Rahibe <ref> [28] </ref> calculate fl for some examples. The work of Chassaing, Letac and Mora [10] is closer to our determination of fl f . But in all their examples, matrices, unlike B in (1.1), have only non-negative entries. In our opinion, the random Fibonacci recurrence is more natural than these examples.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the techniques described in this paper for fl f (1=2) do not seem to generalize easily to fl f (p), 0 &lt; p &lt; 1.

Reference-contexts: other remarkable example is Daubechies' wavelets; the solution to f (t) = p 4 3 + 3 f (2t 1) + p 4 + p 4 has an irregular graph which is a type of fractal, yet it can be used to construct wavelets that approximate smooth functions very well <ref> [33, p. 437] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Since the slopes of the backward maps vary in magnitude from 0 to 1, not only is -f self-similar <ref> [34] </ref>, the self-similarity equation has multiple scales. Self-similar functions, especially ones with multiple scales, usually turn out to be fractals.
