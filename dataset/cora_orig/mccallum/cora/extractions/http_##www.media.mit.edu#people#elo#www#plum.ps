Reference-contexts: First, a generator determines the content of text and its degree of detail. Then, it determines what words to use and in what order or style to present the content. An opposing view (e.g. <ref> [Appelt 1985] </ref>) criticizes this sequential processing, arguing that the two parts cannot be separated. For instance, the style of the presentation can also inuence the choice of the content. The simplest kind of natural language generation uses templates to produce text.

Reference-contexts: Matt Mullican witnessed how the meaning of his artwork changed, as he hung a ag in yellow and black on a museum in Brussels. He was unaware that the colors symbolize the Flemish Nationalists. The meaning of a sign depends on the cultural context. <ref> [Blauvelt] </ref> Working toward universal logos, I used familiar objects to illustrate the functionality of each PLUM component. Filtering of news streams brings to mind a colander. Because the Parser analyzes incoming news wires and extracts features from them, a colander is too static an object.

Reference-contexts: The public has an impression that the developing world is exclusively a theater of tragedy... This misconception is as profound as it is widespread, said Peter Adamson, 1 author of UNICEFs annual State of the Worlds Children report <ref> [Cate 1993] </ref>. Misconceptions arise from ignorance and lack of familiarity. The current style of reportage of tragic disasters may only exacerbate these misconceptions. News that clearly explains the scope of the disaster or gives a scale to interpret large figures, provides a more realistic image. 1.

Reference-contexts: It is generally agreed, that a days tailored news needs to be accompanied by a selection of news compiled with another method or by an editor. The on-line newspaper Fishwrap personalizes news for members of the MIT community <ref> [Chesnais 1995] </ref>. In addition to specifying topics of interest or choosing to receive news from their home region, readers can follow the interests of the Fishwrap readership. While browsing articles, readers can add meaningful and interesting ones to Page One.

Reference-contexts: Natural Language Generation Natural Language Generation is a field of joint research for linguists and computer scientists. Their goal is to design computer programs that generate grammatically and stylistically correct prose. Natural language generation is often divided into two parts, what to say and how to say it (e.g. <ref> [Dale 1990] </ref>). First, a generator determines the content of text and its degree of detail. Then, it determines what words to use and in what order or style to present the content. An opposing view (e.g. [Appelt 1985]) criticizes this sequential processing, arguing that the two parts cannot be separated. <p> Augmented text also alters the mode, stereotypical reporting of disasters, because references to the home community make the style more personal. An article written to a global audience acquires a more local tone. For effective prose, language generation systems have to assure a rhetorical structure for the text <ref> [Dale 1990] </ref>. When generated text exceeds a few sentences, the system needs to present the points in a logical sequence, with a beginning, middle and end. PLUM avoids having to assure rhetorical structure because it does not rewrite the original story.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, such a system could enter facts directly into a database from large collections of text on a constrained domain. PLUM belongs to this class of text processing systems. The first text interpretation system, FRUMP, skimmed and summarized news on world events, including news on disasters <ref> [DeJong 1979] </ref>. FRUMP employed extensive knowledge about the topic of the text to improve its analysis. It used sketchy scripts to organize the knowledge on 60 different situations. A sketchy script described the most likely events reported in an article.

Reference-contexts: They were tested on another 50 articles and corrected accordingly (See 8.1. Quantitative evaluation) Annex 1 lists the complete patterns for the ten features. 29 To analyze articles, PLUM uses Professor Ken Haases multi-scale parser <ref> [Haase 1993] </ref>. The multi scale parser tags every word in text with the class and the stem of the word. For example, in 30 peo ple were evacuated evacuated is tagged as #(evacuated :PASSIVE-VERB evacuate). The class and stem information in the tag is useful.
Reference: [Haase 1995] <author> Ken Haase and Sara Elo. FramerD, </author> <title> The Dtype Frame System. MIT Media Lab internal report, </title> <year> 1995. </year>
Reference-contexts: Two large cities, Boston, Massachusetts, and Helsinki, Finland, and a small rural town, Bellefontaine, Ohio, were the initial prototype home communities. Buenos Aires, Argentina, was added later to provide the perspective of a third continent. 6.2.1. Data structures in PLUM FactBase The FactBase is stored in FramerD <ref> [Haase 1995] </ref>, a frame-based representation language. The basic object in FramerD is a frame. Minsky [Minsky 1986] introduced frames as a data structure for Artificial Intelligence programs to store knowledge. A frame has slots of values. <p> The systems were to interpret texts on topics such as terrorism and military reports as fast and accurately as possible. AI NLP also inspires some of the research on text-analysis in the Machine Understanding Group at the MIT Media Lab. Professor Ken Haases on-going research <ref> [Haase 1995] </ref> processes text in order to match analogous sentences or phrases. Haases system implements multi-scale parsing to process archives of news articles. It constructs a representation of the content based on each words class, its role within the sentence and its entry in the digital thesaurus WordNet.

Reference-contexts: The key phrases are then presented to the reader. [Salton 1983] A sophisticated natural language generator varies its output depending on the context. According to the Register Theory within Systemic-Functional Linguistics <ref> [Halliday 1985] </ref>, language varies along three dimensions: field: the subject matter mode: the purpose of the text, e.g. reference vs. tutorial tenor: the relationship to the audience A language generation system usually varies text along just one of the three dimensions.

Reference-contexts: Comparing the mental maps suggests that the image of the same city varies significantly from person to person. Holahan <ref> [Holahan 1978] </ref> studied how cognitive maps are distorted in relation to a persons daily trips to work and home. If a person frequents an area, the size of the area is exaggerated in the persons mental map.

Reference-contexts: A poor knowledge of world geography and distances also causes misunderstandings. For example, when a hurricane hit the Southern Caribbean some years back, tourists cancelled their trips to Jamaica <ref> [IDNDR 1994] </ref>. Disaster news is appropriate for augmentation, because natural catastrophes occur on every continent. Two communities across the world with different cultural backgrounds and life-styles may have little This is the same as travelers to New York City staying home when a hurricane hits central Florida. 12 in common.

Reference-contexts: PAD allows defining different layers of text and zooming between the different layers to view more or less detail. Positioning the augmentations in the margins of the original text, presents an interesting task of optimizing lay-out. <ref> [Ishizaki 1995] </ref> Suguru Ishizakis agent-based approach to dynamic design could be applied to this problem. Ishizaki presents a theory whereby all objects in a layout possess local behav-iours. Each object positions itself within the whole as best as it can.

Reference-contexts: AI natural language processing incorporates parsers or part-of-speech taggers to recognize the grammatical role of words. Recent work in story-understanding seeks to accomplish specific tasks <ref> [Jacobs 1993] </ref>. A text interpreter should be able to accurately extract pre-defined facts from text on a given topic. Ideally, such a system could enter facts directly into a database from large collections of text on a constrained domain. PLUM belongs to this class of text processing systems.

Reference-contexts: More sophisticated approaches propose autonomous agents to update a profile by analyzing a persons e-mail and calendar. Because current text processing tools are not reliable enough to do this autonomously, the user needs to verify the profile. Webhunter <ref> [Lashkari 1995] </ref> uses yet another approach. It generalizes from profiles of other readers with similar interests and proposes a tailored selection of web documents to a person. While filtered information can save a readers time, it may sacrifice the diversity of information.

Reference: [McQuail 1987] <author> Denis McQuail. </author> <title> Mass Communication Theory. </title> <publisher> Sage Publications, </publisher> <year> 1987. </year>
Reference-contexts: Since a Finnish apple pie has no crust on top, Finnish children would not recognize an American-style pie. A faithful translation was sacrificed to avoid misunderstandings. Traditional print media sees its audience as a mass and sends the same printed message to all readers <ref> [McQuail 1987] </ref>. Traditionally, when a page was printed with manually assembled metal fonts, cost prohibited tailoring for different readers. Once page layout was computerized, printing different versions became technically simple. However, a newspaper can afford to hire an editor for a special issue only for a sizeable readership.
Reference: [Miller 1990] <author> George Miller. </author> <title> WordNet: An On-line Lexical Database. </title> <journal> International Journal of Lexicography, </journal> <volume> 3(4). </volume>
Reference-contexts: The words accepted as synonyms in a pattern, e.g. drowned and died, or people and res idents, were compiled manually after studying the wording in example articles. Incorporating a digital thesaurus, such as Wordnet <ref> [Miller 1990] </ref>, could help to determine synonyms or related words automatically. However, since wire services use a relatively standard vocabulary to describe disasters, the hand-constructed patterns give satisfactory accuracy as shown in Section 8.1. 6.1.3.

Powers of ten: a book about the relative size of things in the universe and the effect of adding another zero. Red-ding, CO: Scientific American Library; San Francisco: Distributed by W.H. </title> <publisher> Freeman, </publisher> <year> 1982. </year>
Reference-contexts: Viewers and readers tend to generalize from the drama. When a new disaster strikes, the predisposed audience may exaggerate the scale of the disaster. People may also misunderstand the scale of a disaster simply because large numbers are hard to understand. Powers of Ten <ref> [Morrison 1982] </ref> explains how all familiar objects can be measured in six orders of magnitude. We can see a few millimeter insect on our palm, while even the tallest trees and buildings are never over a hundred meters. Numbers smaller or larger are hard to imagine.

Reference-contexts: Expert systems, computer programs that answer questions about a narrow subject, adapt to the user's level of knowledge. A tailored presentation by an expert system should not present any information obvious to the user or include facts the user cannot understand. The expert system TAILOR <ref> [Paris 1993] </ref> describes an engine in terms appropriate for a hobbyist or an engineer. 14 Filtering, a common tailoring technique for digitally distributed news, matches articles with a readers interest model [Yan 1995]. The simplest reader profile consists of keywords that describe topics of interest. <p> For example, an expert system varies its tenor by adapting to the user's level of knowledge of the subject matter <ref> [Paris 1993] </ref>. Augmentation varies text in more than one way. Augmenting a disaster article expands the field, because it includes background information on the history of disasters, the disaster-struck community and the readers home community.

Reference-contexts: Visualizing Augmentations An augmented article is a suitable object for graphical visualization and dynamic layout. Because augmented articles consist of several levels of information, the original body, the augmentations, and the background resources, the PAD system could display them elegantly <ref> [Perlin 1993] </ref>. PAD allows defining different layers of text and zooming between the different layers to view more or less detail.

Reference-contexts: The pattern matching techniques in PLUM resemble those used by another Machine Understanding Group project, SpinDoctor <ref> [Sack 1994] </ref>. Warren Sacks system analyzes news from Central America to detect the point of view of the author. It looks for patterns of words that reveal how an actor in the news is depicted.

Reference-contexts: This chapter describes how the techniques PLUM uses situate within the fields of natural language understanding and generation. 11.1. Natural Language Understanding The natural language processing community can be roughly divided into two camps. Researchers such as Gerald Salton use statistical techniques in processing text <ref> [Salton 1983] </ref>. For example, word frequencies and co-occurrences help to discover clusters of related documents. They also help determine if a document is a summary of another. <p> Automatic summarization of documents is another type of language generation. Instead of producing 60 original text, most summarization techniques exploit the structure of a document to recognize key phrases in a document. The key phrases are then presented to the reader. <ref> [Salton 1983] </ref> A sophisticated natural language generator varies its output depending on the context.
Reference: [Scarry 1966] <editor> Richard Scarry. Richard Scarrys Storybook Dictionary. </editor> <publisher> Dean Publishers, </publisher> <year> 1966. </year>
Reference-contexts: Although translation is considered a literal rendering from one language into another, translated text is sometimes altered to fit an audience. A simple but illustrative example is the Finnish translation of Richard Scarrys Storybook Dictionary <ref> [Scarry 1966] </ref>. The original apple pie on the dinner table is labeled as a potato casserole. Since a Finnish apple pie has no crust on top, Finnish children would not recognize an American-style pie. A faithful translation was sacrificed to avoid misunderstandings.

Reference-contexts: The second approach grew out of the Artificial Intelligence community. The so-called AI natural language processing of the 70s and 80s aims to understand the detailed story told in text: who did what, when, where? <ref> [Schank 1977] </ref> Such story understanding is evaluated by asking questions to see if the system can draw inferences. AI natural language processing incorporates parsers or part-of-speech taggers to recognize the grammatical role of words. Recent work in story-understanding seeks to accomplish specific tasks [Jacobs 1993].
Reference: [Schank 1990] <author> Roger Schank. </author> <title> Tell Me a Story. </title> <publisher> Charles Scribner's Sons, </publisher> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: Since a computer allows tailoring of information, digital news can be made meaningful to an individual reader. According to the cognitive science and psychology communities, people understand something new in terms of something they have understood previously (e.g. <ref> [Schank 1990] </ref>). This supports tailoring news by relating it to familiar concepts in the home community. It can bring news closer to home.

Reference-contexts: Like people who have lived through a catastrophe feel a bond with others with similar experiences <ref> [Wraith 1994] </ref>, communities that have survived a disaster may feel sympathy and willingness to help one another. By pointing to similar events in two communities, they may feel connected. From a computational point of view, disasters news is also ideal for augmentation.
Reference: [Wurman 1989] <author> Richard S. Wurman. </author> <title> Information Anxiety. </title> <publisher> Doubleday, </publisher> <year> 1989. </year>
Reference-contexts: The PLUM archives are not part of the Fish wrap version of PLUM. 5.1.3. PLUM provides a yardstick for quantities and areas To make numbers more meaningful to a reader, PLUM uses techniques inspired by Richard Wurmans book, Information Anxiety <ref> [Wurman 1989] </ref>. Wurman points to the need for a personal media-measuring stick. He wants to turn statistics into meaningful numbers, data into information, facts into stories with value. Wurman seeks common sense explanations. As an example of a meaningless entity, Wurman takes the size of an acre.
