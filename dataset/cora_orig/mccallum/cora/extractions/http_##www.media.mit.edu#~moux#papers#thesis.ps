Reference-contexts: Pleiades introduces taskspecific and informationspecific agents deployed in different levels that can collaborate with one another to provide the information requested by the user. Another category of WWW agents includes Carnegie Mellons University Web-watcher <ref> (Armstrong et al., 1995) </ref> and MIT Media Laboratory's Letizia Related Software Agent Systems 26 Chapter 2 - Motivation, Issues and Related Work (Lieberman, 1995). These agents are designed to assist the user and provide personalization, while the user browses the WWW.

Reference-contexts: In order to accelerate the destruction of noncompetent agents and the evolution of new ones we introduced a linear decay function which can be seen as a type of rent Interaction between IFAs and IDAs Chapter 4 - Architecture 45 <ref> (Baclace, 1992) </ref>. In order for the agents to inhabit the ecosystem they have to pay something. If the credits they gain exceed this rent then they live. Otherwise they are removed and new ones are created.

Reference-contexts: These agents are designed to assist the user and provide personalization, while the user browses the WWW. They perform a breadth-first search on the links ahead and provide navigation recommendations. More similar to our work in terms of application domain and representation is the system built at Stanford <ref> (Balabanovic and Shoham, 1995) </ref>. They introduced a system for WWW document filtering which also utilized the weighted keyword vector representation. In terms of evolutionary filtering systems, NewT (Sheth and Maes, 1993) developed at the Media Lab, is a multiagent system that uses evolution and relevance feedback for information filtering.

Reference-contexts: Other efforts to visualize information retrieval results include the method introduced by <ref> (Bartell et al., 1994) </ref> which organizes retrieval term and phrase weights in the perimeter of a circle. 3.7 Client Server Communication The AUI is using standard socket communication to the Amalthaea server.
Reference: <author> Belew, R. </author> <year> (1989). </year> <title> Evolution Learning and Culture: Computational metaphors for adaptive algorithms. </title> <institution> UC at San Diego Technical Report CS89-156. </institution>
Reference-contexts: For the sake of this project the distinction between the genotypes and phenotypes (as discussed in the next sections) is quite narrow. Usually a more complex development process occurs for deriving the phenotype from the genotype <ref> (Belew, 1989) </ref>. In our case there is no individual learning or adaptation of individual agents, resulting in an one-point phenotypic search space.
Reference: <author> Belew, R. </author> <year> (1997). </year> <type> Personal communication. </type>
Reference-contexts: However, other types of equilibria, namely those that 70 Chapter 7 - Concluding Remarks and Future Work emerge as the user learns about a subject area or the speed at which an area of interests is changing as reflected by the changing documents? <ref> (Belew, 1997) </ref> The issue of trust which the user must have towards the agent is a very important one; it is quite difficult in a multiagent setting to express the state of the system to the user and to be able to show why the system performed a certain action.
Reference: <author> Belew, R. and Mitchell, M. </author> <year> (1996). </year> <title> Adaptive individuals in evolving populations. </title> <publisher> Addison-Wesley. </publisher>
Reference-contexts: Optimization or adaptation is a result of the overall/macroscopic behavior of the system, and not of individual learning by the members of the population. However evolution can coexist with systems where the individual entities exhibit some sort of learning <ref> (Belew and Mitchell, 1996) </ref>. Amalthaea falls in the former category. 2.8 Multiagent Systems Multi-Agent systems provide a collaborative way of solving complex problems by multiple agents.

Reference-contexts: Again, based on a bottom-up, biologically inspired approach we use the term collaboration to refer to a form of symbiosis. In general, interpreting the terms depends a lot from what field one approaches agents from. 2.3 Information Filtering Information filtering systems usually share the following characteristics <ref> (Belkin and Croft, 1992) </ref> They involve large incoming streams of data They primarily deal with unstructured or semi-structured textual data They are based on some sort of predefined filter Information Filtering Chapter 2 - Motivation, Issues and Related Work 21 Their objective is to prune data that does not match the <p> As mentioned before, the user profile representation methods used by different systems vary. Smart-like keyword vector representations, keyword search based rules, neural networks and genetic algorithms are among the most popular. 2.4 Information Retrieval Although they appear similar to filtering systems, Information Retrieval (IR) systems have inherently different characteristics <ref> (Belkin and Croft, 1992) </ref>: Information retrieval usually deals with static databases of information as opposed to the dynamic streams used in filtering. Information retrieval systems are usually query-based as opposed to non query driven filtering systems.

Reference-contexts: The techniques used in content-based filtering can vary greatly in complexity. Keyword-based search is one of the simplest techniques that involves matching different combinations of keywords (sometimes in boolean form). The Newsweeder system (Lang, 1995) was designed for filtering in USENET newsgroups. The Fishwrap system <ref> (Chesnais et al., 1995) </ref> developed at the Media Lab at the early 90s is another such system.

Reference-contexts: The technique is inspired by an approach called Market-Based Control. As Clearwater put it Market-Based Control is a paradigm for controlling complex systems that otherwise would be very difficult to control, maintain or expand'' <ref> (Clearwater, 1996) </ref>. Our form of control views the system as a miniature economy. We are trying to yield desirable global behavior in a complex system on the basis of agents acting on local information.

Reference-contexts: Webcompass is a WWW product by Quarterdeck. Webcompass is directed towards offline search and indexing. It enables the user to generate queries that will search the WWW offline and presents the results at a later time. The MACRON multiagent system <ref> (Decker and Lesser, 1995) </ref> developed at UMass/ Amherst, is built on top of the CIG searchbots and uses a centralized planner to generate subgoals that are pursued by a group of cooperating agents, using KQML (Labrou and Finin, 1994), a standardized language for inter-agent communication and negotiation.

Reference-contexts: The initial engine for document retrieval was based on the WWW Organization's libwww library <ref> (Frystyk and Lie, 1994) </ref>. However, Amalthaea's latest version of the engine is a Java application. Although there is a slight performance loss, we found that the Java language's handling of outside connections is much more efficient and portable.

RAISE is a rule-based system that provides a framework for knowledge reuse in different domains (like electronic mail, newsgroups e.t.c.) INFOrmer (Riordan and Sorensen, 1995), developed at University of Cork introduces the idea of using associative networks instead of keywords for information retrieval.

Reference-contexts: multi-agent systems like Amalthaea are not trying to solve the old AI problem, they are just tools to assist human capabilities and lead to a world of augmented intelligence (Maes, 1997). 2.7 Evolutionary Techniques Adaptation in computer systems via evolution was first proposed by John Hol-land as a limited framework <ref> (Holland, 1962) </ref> and later in a full-blown form (Holland, 1975). Evolutionary techniques have been used to evolve program code in search for an optimal solution to a programming problem (Koza, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Several enhancements can be made to the user interface in order to support the capabilities described above. The visualization solution we are offering can be greatly enhanced in a variety of ways, one of them is by using self-organizing topographical maps <ref> (Kohonen, 1989) </ref>. The idea behind them is a network composed of nodes that would store multidimensional weight vectors.

Reference-contexts: Evolutionary techniques have been used to evolve program code in search for an optimal solution to a programming problem <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref>. It has also been used to evolve collections of parameters rather than the code that uses them (for instance neural network evolution, general optimization problems, etc.) Evolutionary systems draw paradigms from biology and apply them to computer science and usually refer to populations of computational entities that compete.

Reference-contexts: Lets take for instance the relationships between the Information Filtering and Discovery Agents: some may disagree with the use of the termscooperation or collaboration because this implies a more active desire to cooperate maybe through formal exchange of information, through KQML <ref> (Labrou and Finin, 1994) </ref> for instance. Again, based on a bottom-up, biologically inspired approach we use the term collaboration to refer to a form of symbiosis. <p> The MACRON multiagent system (Decker and Lesser, 1995) developed at UMass/ Amherst, is built on top of the CIG searchbots and uses a centralized planner to generate subgoals that are pursued by a group of cooperating agents, using KQML <ref> (Labrou and Finin, 1994) </ref>, a standardized language for inter-agent communication and negotiation.

Reference-contexts: Systems that use these approaches include Lens (Malone et al., 1987), GroupLens (Resnik et al., 1994) Webhound, <ref> (Lashkari, 1995) </ref>, and Ringo (Shardanand and Maes, 1995). <p> The overall performance of the system was good and it was improving over time. Compared to other WWW filtering systems that use different filtering techniques the performance of Amalthaea proved to be as good. Media Laboratorys Web-hound project <ref> (Lashkari, 1995) </ref> is a WWW filtering system that uses featured-guided automated collaborative filtering (FGACF) techniques. Although the underlying technology is different, the similar assessment methods used in both Amalthaea and Webhound enable us to compare the performance of the two systems. <p> In Amalthaeas architecture this problem is partly addressed by the inherent randomness of the evolution process, but this alone is not enough. If Amalthaea, a content-based Chapter 7 - Concluding Remarks and Future Work 71 system was combined with a collaborative filtering system like Webhound <ref> (Lashkari, 1995) </ref> the system could offer recommendations on novel subjects that were not part of the original IFAs repertoire. 72 Chapter 7 - Concluding Remarks and Future Work 73 Amalthaea: Information Filtering and Discovery in an Evolving MultiAgent System

Reference-contexts: The main difference between NewT and Amalth-aea (apart from the application domain) is that NewT employed only one kind of agents, namely specialized information filters, while the system presented here introduces different types of agents which base their relationships on a simple market-based model. The Infospiders or ARACHNID project <ref> (Menczer et al., 1995) </ref> at University of California at San Diego combine evolutionary techniques with the idea of endogenous fitness to create a scalable distributed information retrieval system.

CMUs RETSINA project (Sycara et al., 1996, Sycara and D., 1996, Decker et al., 1997) defines a framework for distributed intelligent agents.

Reference-contexts: Information retrieval mainly focuses on static, organized, and structured databases Information Retrieval systems are divided into three major categories: Boolean-based systems, Vectorspace based systems and probabilistic systems <ref> (Salton and Buckley, 1987, Salton, 1983) </ref>. Boolean systems are based on keywords or phrases that are combined with boolean operators (like AND, OR, NOT) to form queries. <p> Finally the database is used for keeping track of the URLs already included in previous digests to prevent presentation of duplicate information to the user. Amalthaea's internal representation of documents is based on a standard information retrieval technique called weighted vector representation <ref> (Salton and Buckley, 1987) </ref>. The basic representation of the Information Filtering Agents and the parsed HTML files is the weighted keyword vector.

Reference-contexts: More similar to our work in terms of application domain and representation is the system built at Stanford (Balabanovic and Shoham, 1995). They introduced a system for WWW document filtering which also utilized the weighted keyword vector representation. In terms of evolutionary filtering systems, NewT <ref> (Sheth and Maes, 1993) </ref> developed at the Media Lab, is a multiagent system that uses evolution and relevance feedback for information filtering. NewT's application domain is structured newsgroups documents (clarinet) and the system is able to adapt successfully to such a dynamic environment. <p> Our experimentation methods closely follow those introduced by the NewT and Webhound research projects <ref> (Sheth and Maes, 1993 and Lashkari, 1995) </ref> here at the Media Lab. One of the goals of this research project was to produce a useful system, utilized frequently by internet users. Experiments to assess the positive or negative feedback of the users were an important part of the evaluation process.

Reference-contexts: CMUs RETSINA project (Sycara et al., 1996, Sycara and D., 1996, Decker et al., 1997) defines a framework for distributed intelligent agents. This framework was applied to organizational decision making in the Pleiades system <ref> (Sycara, 1995) </ref> and to financial investment management in the Warren system. Pleiades introduces taskspecific and informationspecific agents deployed in different levels that can collaborate with one another to provide the information requested by the user.
