Abstract: It seems to be a common feeling that animals learn to see, and this feeling, together with the reemergence of computer learning paradigms that mimic many forms of human learning, has raised hopes that learning is the key to the computer vision problem. Indeed, it seems clear that Nature does not "program" all our visual capabilities into the genome, and we certainly know that programming a computer with a closed-form solution to the vision problem is a daunting task. This aim of this informal and elementary report (basically a term paper) is to cast doubt on the idea that biological systems learn to see. The complex process of development, beginning at fertilization and ending with a mature individual, could be considered to have genetic ("nature") and learning ("nurture") processes as logical endpoints or opposite poles. This report mostly considers what goes on between those endpoints, and is meant to raise the possibility that some of the least understood processes in biology are responsible for visual capabilities.

Reference-contexts: Learning is indeed useful in computer vision. If one can already see, then learning and vision work together nicely. For instance, with vision we can learn model parameters that can be used for matching and object recognition there are endless examples of this, from ancient <ref> [1] </ref> to modern [13]. I reemphasize that this report concerns learning vision, not learning using vision.

Gradient descent, simulated annealing, and genetic techniques are all ways to search an "energy landscape" of solutions, with genetic techniques (GAs) having the advantage that they are the least well understood.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly, there does not seem to be evidence for cat-like orientational sensitivity in monkeys [90]. Dark rearing only degrades monkey spatial vision an octave or so. Spatial vision development correlates with gestational time, not postnatal time (i.e. not visual experience) (Boothe, in <ref> [3] </ref>.) 24 I'll say more about cooperation in Section 5.4, but one argument for the sort of plasticity that leads to orientational specificity is that it allows calibration that leads to sharper stereo vision. Plasticity is needed to adjust to individual variations and to variations due to growth and maturation.

Reference-contexts: Johnson's book on development has a defense of connectionism as a formalism for studying developmental-type calculations <ref> [5] </ref>, and a PDP volume makes similar arguments [74]. If one were to study the generation of structure by some developmental-like mechanism, then LISP code or simple computing networks are obvious primitives.

Reference-contexts: to do with acquiring vision than learning does. 5 Beyond "Nature or Nurture" Any binary distinction between nature and nurture (genetic determinism versus learning) is convincingly refuted by ample evidence of an entire range of processes that operate in more or less mysterious ways to structure both brain and behavior <ref> [48, 6, 42, 66] </ref>. Early on it was realized, though not universally, that heredity and environment were not "either- or" causes for any identifiable behavioral trait. The only reasonable answer is that the two proportions [of influence] are one hundred percent environment, one hundred per cent heredity. <p> Preformationist theories (of the seventeenth century, say) held that a completely formed being exists in either the egg or the sperm, and the other partner's contribution diffuses 12 vary widely as well <ref> [6] </ref> into this being. Neopreformationism explains cellular differentiation by the mechanism that the full complement of hereditary material present after conception is reduced during development, so that each cell type has a specific subset of genes, which determines its type. <p> Developmental phenomena exhibit sensitive periods , which are times during development that the right sort of experience produces developmental results, and that deprivation of experience can cause deficits (e.g. Fig. 6). Several good examples can be found in <ref> [72, 6, 41] </ref>; most humans find language learning (especially accents) harder after puberty, for instance. Social behavior, love, and sexual behavior are strongly influenced in monkeys by early deprivation [32, 31].

Reference-contexts: My apologies to those not represented here through my ignorance. I hope alert readers can point me to other relevant work. Belew considers that a computational model of ontogenic development can be used as a bridge between genetic algorithms and neural networks <ref> [7] </ref>. The idea is to generate neural nets using genetic algorithms, and the nets go on to learn by normal Hebbian principles. The genome in Belew's work is expressed by way of a context-sensitive grammar.

I cannot resist this story which argues that in one species the sung song is learned in a highly unstructured, "equipotential" way. The marsh warbler Acrocephalus palustris learns all its songs in its first autumn and winter and thereafter does not change its songs.

Reference-contexts: The learning which so fascinates and mystifies us when we contemplate acquisition of general and episodic knowledge, motor and cognitive skills, language and reading, pales by comparison with the electrifying conundrum that is development - T. Sejnowski <ref> [14] </ref>. This short section contains what I have found in the way of computational models for development as they relate or could relate to vision. My apologies to those not represented here through my ignorance. I hope alert readers can point me to other relevant work. <p> To my mind it is just the sort of research that needs to be carried out, but I feel that the tools available today are frustratingly weak for such work. 31 parallel? 32 Churchland and Sejnowski's excellent book <ref> [14] </ref> mentions probably the most successful case his-tory of developmental modeling at least the one that exploits Hebbian (connectionist) principles - Miller and Stryker's model of ocular dominance column development [54, 55]. The computer modeling is complemented by laboratory tests on kittens.

Reference-contexts: as we should expect if developmental processes are more important than learning, artificially dark-reared kittens and monkeys have surprising visual powers. 5.2 Brain Development Development of the brain is marked by an initial overproduction of neurons, some thirty percent of which (in rodents) quickly die off through time and experience <ref> [15, 64] </ref>. Not just neurons, but synapses are initially overproduced both in the muscles and the central nervous system. These too are tuned, or specialized, by elimination [68]. Cortical neurons are born in the interior of the developing brain and migrate outwards, using amoeboid processes, to increasingly outer cortical layers.

Reference-contexts: After the critical period, damage is much more permanent. One ameliorating effect, consistent with the competitive nature of this sort of development, is that dark rearing can extend sensitive periods <ref> [16] </ref>. Interestingly, there does not seem to be evidence for cat-like orientational sensitivity in monkeys [90]. Dark rearing only degrades monkey spatial vision an octave or so.

Reference-contexts: Further, if the two cells resulting from the first division of a fertilized egg are separated into separate cells (blastomeres), either suffices to create a complete individual <ref> [17] </ref> (Fig. 5). Developmental phenomena exhibit sensitive periods , which are times during development that the right sort of experience produces developmental results, and that deprivation of experience can cause deficits (e.g. Fig. 6). <p> effect initiates or allows the next; developmental effects "set the stage" for later ones, sometimes in trivial ways, sometimes in non-trivial ways. 13 tadpoles at different stages of development when placed into egg cells support the development of normal adult frogs. 14 re-grown in (a) echinoderm, (b) amphibian, (c) mammal <ref> [17] </ref>. 15 wren from a tape-recording tutor.

Reference-contexts: Vision Without Much Experience Is Common: Even in humans, relatively sophisticated visual abilities are attributable to infants: Yet infants of only 3-5 months do seem to know that a hidden object is still there when looking rather than reaching is the dependent measure [cites three references]. <ref> [18] </ref> This last quotation is from a paper in which Diamond makes experiments to demonstrate that hippocampal development in infants is more complete than previously thought; she does this, as referred to in the quote, by using a measure of infant "knowledge" based on looking, not reaching.

Reference-contexts: These results have been duplicated under various stringent control regimes and appear solid <ref> [19] </ref>. The rest of the above "laws" have not been severely damaged by psychological experiments. The highly stylized methods of these experiments possibly have not tested the theory across a broad spectrum of conditions. <p> Rats can learn to associate taste with illness but not taste with electric shock. Contrariwise, they can associate flashing lights and noise with shock, but not flashing lights and noise with illness [25]. These "tasty-water" and illness, "bright-noisy water" and shock results have been extensively and carefully reduplicated <ref> [19] </ref>. It can be shown that differential learning of particular cue-reinforcer pairs happens in instrumental as well as classical conditioning. In other words some jobs are harder to condition either classically or instrumentally.

Reference-contexts: So they simply learn sounds as they go. As a result the average marsh warbler's song incorporates an average of 76 other birdsongs, and the total number of species copied in marsh warbler songs is over 212 <ref> [20] </ref>. In fact, to the extent that subsongs are not identified, they can be taken as evidence for the existence of as-yet-uncataloged African species. 8. There is still ample room to wriggle, and to some extent these systems can cover for each other in humans.

Reference-contexts: Visual acuity in human newborns is low, at about 20/600, and contrast sensitivity also is poor; both improve significantly over the first six months. By three months, infants can distinguish patterns on the basis of their shape and form <ref> [21] </ref>. In normal early development, a (speculative) emerging "wiring diagram" can be (speculatively) related to anatomical structure and even behavior [40].

Reference-contexts: Whether the training times and regimes are biologically realistic is an issue, and so is the place of the results in a systematic description of how we learn to do vision. Edelman's work on the Darwin architectures (e.g. <ref> [22] </ref>) does not attempt to reproduce parameterized aspects of biological systems, but tries to use self-organizing neural techniques to produce a (simulation of a) seeing, behaving system. The learning rules are at least partly inspired by Merzenich's work on stimulus co-occurrence as a signal for synapse development [53].

Reference-contexts: Thus one might predict that conditioning could take place with negative time displacements, not just positive ones: that temporal linking could be quite flexible. Another approach is that of Gallistel <ref> [23] </ref>, whose representational theory grants many explicit representations for directionality, distance, time, etc. to even the simplest brains, and thus predicts a highly non-uniform neural architecture model. 6.

Reference-contexts: One of the cornerstone laws of learning, the first in the list above, was removed by the work of Garcia <ref> [24] </ref> on food aversion learning, in which a rat learns to avoid food that makes it sick, even 8 with a delay of up to twelve hours between the rat's ingesting food and the subsequent illness effect.

Reference-contexts: animals do some sort of useful vision almost purely without experience. "Visual cliff" experiments show depth-perception in the form of cliff avoidance as soon as an animal can see (1 day in goats, 4 weeks in rats), and independent of experience (dark-reared rats first exposed to light at 3 months) <ref> [26] </ref>. There are chickens and related species like pheasants, the naturally reared-in-the-dark prairie dogs, the ungulate"runners" such as bison and lambs, and there are artificially dark-reared cats.

Reference-contexts: A mallard duckling needs the prenatal, embryonic "contact-contentment" calls of its siblings (i.e. the embryo in the egg needs to hear from the surrounding eggs) in order to develop postnatal preferences for the maternal calls of its own species later (e.g. <ref> [27] </ref>). Chick activity and imprinting must of course take place during proper sensitive periods [41], and several fascinating imprinting studies have revealed intriguing interactions between experience- dependent and experience-expectant processes.

Reference-contexts: Computers are good at rote memorization. Let us ignore the fact that some people may be reluctant to equate rote memorization with learning. One theory of vision involves (or simply is) matching into a database of object "views" (e.g. <ref> [37] </ref>, among many others). If rote memorization can solve the vision problem then learning is indeed used, and an experience-dependent and simple form of learning it is, too.

Reference-contexts: as we should expect if developmental processes are more important than learning, artificially dark-reared kittens and monkeys have surprising visual powers. 5.2 Brain Development Development of the brain is marked by an initial overproduction of neurons, some thirty percent of which (in rodents) quickly die off through time and experience <ref> [15, 64] </ref>. Not just neurons, but synapses are initially overproduced both in the muscles and the central nervous system. These too are tuned, or specialized, by elimination [68]. Cortical neurons are born in the interior of the developing brain and migrate outwards, using amoeboid processes, to increasingly outer cortical layers.

Reference-contexts: Not just neurons, but synapses are initially overproduced both in the muscles and the central nervous system. These too are tuned, or specialized, by elimination <ref> [68] </ref>. Cortical neurons are born in the interior of the developing brain and migrate outwards, using amoeboid processes, to increasingly outer cortical layers.

One way to think about experience-expectant processes is that they are just regular learning with some sort of "bias".

Reference-contexts: One would naively consider binocularity or monocularity as something that was purely determined by genetics. Wrong: varying the amount of magnesium chloride leads the fish Fundulus heteroclitus to develop with one functioning eye as opposed to the normal two <ref> [71] </ref>. Is the number and location of eyes an adaptive characteristic, and is information about such number and location in the genome or in its relationship with its chemical environment? The mechanisms of development are hard to understand but at least one debate seems to have been sorted out [65].

Reference-contexts: The view that all learning is conditioning leads to several consequences, including the possibility of general laws of learning (e.g. general process theory) and predictions about what can be learned (e.g. equipotentiality). Roper <ref> [72] </ref> examines the case for both general process theory and equipotentiality theory, and the next two sections are taken from his chapter. 4.1 General Process Theory General process theory holds that all instances of associative learning involve the same basic underlying mechanism or process, which leads directly to the hope of <p> Developmental phenomena exhibit sensitive periods , which are times during development that the right sort of experience produces developmental results, and that deprivation of experience can cause deficits (e.g. Fig. 6). Several good examples can be found in <ref> [72, 6, 41] </ref>; most humans find language learning (especially accents) harder after puberty, for instance. Social behavior, love, and sexual behavior are strongly influenced in monkeys by early deprivation [32, 31].

Reference-contexts: past, but it had some influence over learning theory that it might be as well to make explicit, since the conditioning paradigm is rather close in some ways to some current learning paradigms in that one uniform mechanism is taken to be responsible for a vast range of phenomena (e.g. <ref> [74] </ref>). In classical conditioning: E1 is a stimulus from experimenter (bell, light), E2 is a reinforcer (food, shock). Conditioning makes the subject pair these two stimuli (respond similarly to either). <p> Johnson's book on development has a defense of connectionism as a formalism for studying developmental-type calculations [5], and a PDP volume makes similar arguments <ref> [74] </ref>. If one were to study the generation of structure by some developmental-like mechanism, then LISP code or simple computing networks are obvious primitives. A recent example of a system that "develops" from nothing, adding layers of network as it gains experience, is the Cresceptron [38].

Reference-contexts: A good start at defining learning in animals is [52]. Broad definitions such as "intelligent systems that learn that is, that improve their performance as the result of experience" <ref> [75] </ref> include many developmental and purely maturational phenomena that are not usually called learning. However, one rather striking difference between what is usually called learning and the sort of developmental phenomena I have in mind is the difference between experience-expectant processes and experience-dependent processes [28].

Reference-contexts: This idea has been dignified with various impressive names (such as radial basis functions), and modernized by calling it a neural net technique, and oversold by calling interpolation "generalization".

Reference-contexts: One could easily imagine a richer taxonomy. Song learning, food caching, and imprinting can be reliably studied in the laboratory, and much of the results in memory systems come from them. Sherry and Schacter <ref> [80] </ref> define multiple memory systems as those that have different operational principles. They then take an evolutionary approach to demonstrate the likelihood of multiple memory systems.

Reference-contexts: Some responses cannot be conditioned; in particular, face-washing in hamsters and scratching in rats <ref> [81, 60] </ref>. The difficulty of conditioning on involuntary scratching is an interesting story, which however raises the basic question of deficits of learning versus deficits of performance. Further evidence is provided by ethological studies. Of course ethologists have always known that there are huge inter-species differences in learning behavior.

Reference-contexts: In caching (in marsh tits and chickadees, say) learning goes on throughout life with no sensitive periods, there is large "generality" (a widely varying set of site types can be remembered), as well as perfect memory of filled caches and forgetting of empty ones <ref> [82] </ref>. The learning of songs to be sung, on the other hand, has sensitive periods, is usually restrictive in what can be learned, and the memory is not adaptable or forgotten.

Reference-contexts: Vision is not easy to modify; many experiments having to do with "learning to compensate" for image displacements are inconclusive and more careful ones reveal that some (perhaps linear) distortions can be compensated but that others cannot, and in general vision is not very adaptable <ref> [84] </ref> Vision Without Experience Is Common: Several animals do some sort of useful vision almost purely without experience.

Reference-contexts: After the critical period, damage is much more permanent. One ameliorating effect, consistent with the competitive nature of this sort of development, is that dark rearing can extend sensitive periods [16]. Interestingly, there does not seem to be evidence for cat-like orientational sensitivity in monkeys <ref> [90] </ref>. Dark rearing only degrades monkey spatial vision an octave or so.
