Abstract: A paradigm of statistical mechanics of financial markets (SMFM) using nonlinear nonequilibrium algorithms, first published in L. Ingber, Mathematical Modelling, 5, 343-361 (1984), is fit to multi-variate financial markets using Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA), a global optimization algorithm, to perform maximum likelihood fits of Lagrangians defined by path integrals of multivariate conditional probabilities. Canonical momenta are thereby derived and used as technical indicators in a recursive ASA optimization process to tune trading rules. These trading rules are then used on out-of-sample data, to demonstrate that they can profit from the SMFM model, to illustrate that these markets are likely not efficient.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Over a decade ago, the author published a paper suggesting the use of newly developed methods of multivariate nonlinear nonequilibrium calculus to approach a statistical mechanics of financial markets (SMFM) <ref> [1] </ref>. That paper also gav e a brief summary of the state of affairs of the equilibrium paradigm of financial markets. These methods were recently applied to interest-rate term-structure systems [2]. Still, for some time, the standard accepted paradigm of financial markets has been rooted in equilibrium processes [3]. <p> These calculations were briey mentioned in another ASA paper [5]. Section 4 is a brief conclusion. 2. SMFM MODEL 2.1. Random Walk Model The following is a brief review of the rationale leading to SMFM close to its original presentation in 1984 <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Success was gained for large-scale systems in neuroscience, in a series of papers on statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions [24,25,39-46], and in nuclear physics [47,48]. This methodology has been used for problems in combat analyses [27,49-52]. These methods have been suggested for financial markets <ref> [1] </ref>, and applied to a term structure model of interest rates [2,53]. Thus, now we can investigate various choices of f 's and ^g's to test algebraic functional forms.

Reference-contexts: These equations represent differential limits of discretized stochastic difference equations, e.g., Wiener noise dW fi h dt <ref> [28] </ref>. The resulting stochastic differential equations (s.d.e.'s) are referred to as Langevin equations [28-33]. The f 's are referred to as the (deterministic) drifts, and the square of the ^g's are related to the diffusions (uctuations or volatilities). <p> This machinery suffices to determine the macroscopic probability distribution [30]. For nonconstant g GG when R 0, it should be noted that the Lagrangian corresponding to the most-probable path is not derived from the variational principle, but is directly related to L <ref> [28] </ref>. To begin introducing economic theory, variables such as (logarithm) price can be postulated to be the basic state-variables. However, it is not clear how to precisely relate L to classical economic equilibrium utility functions.

Reference-contexts: Note that Eq. (8) must be derived from the path integral, Eq. (5), which is at least one reason to justify its development. In the language of nonlinear nonequilibrium thermodynamics <ref> [30] </ref>, the thermodynamic forces are c G = S ,G , where S is the entropy, and the thermodynamic uxes are M G GG c G . <p> In the context of multiplicative Gaussian noise, the condi tional probability of making the state-transition from M G G G G (Q + q ) is then hypothesized to be P [M G G 1 Q dQL)dh. This machinery suffices to determine the macroscopic probability distribution <ref> [30] </ref>. For nonconstant g GG when R 0, it should be noted that the Lagrangian corresponding to the most-probable path is not derived from the variational principle, but is directly related to L [28].

Reference-contexts: The inclusion of the ^g's, called multiplicative noise, recently has been shown to very well mathematically and physically model other forms of noise, e.g., shot noise, colored noise, dichotomic noise [34-37]. Finite-jumps diffusions also can be included <ref> [38] </ref>. These new methods of nonlinear statistical mechanics only recently have been applied to complex large-scale physical problems, demonstrating that observed data can be described by the use of these algebraic functional forms. <p> of other physical systems, which are also continuous time models of discrete processes, conclude that the Stratonovich interpretation coincides with reality, when multiplicative noise with zero correlation time, modelled in terms of white noise h j , is properly considered as the limit of real noise with finite correlation time <ref> [38] </ref>. The path integral succinctly demonstrates the difference between the two: The Ito prescription corresponds to the pre-point discretization of L, wherein q M (Q) fi M r+1 - M r and M (Q) fi M r .

Reference-contexts: However, in some cases <ref> [40] </ref>, L is a definite aid to finding such stationary states.] Typically, in other financial studies, only properties of stationary states are examined, but here a temporal dependence is included. E.g., the M G terms in L permit steady states and their uctuations to be investigated in a nonequilibrium context.

Reference-contexts: Mesoscopic variables have been defined as M G in the Langevin and Fokker-Planck representations, in terms of their development from the microscopic system labeled by j. The Riemannian curvature term R arises from nonlinear g GG , which is a bona fide metric of this parameter space <ref> [55] </ref>. Even if a stationary solution, i.e., M G = 0, is ultimately sought, a necessarily prior stochastic treatment of M G terms gives rise to these Riemannian corrections. Even for a constant metric, the term h G ;G contributes to L for a non linear mean h G .

Reference-contexts: Using the variational principle below, J TG may also be used to constrain M G to regions where they are empirically bound. More complicated constraints may be affixed to L using methods of optimal control theory <ref> [58] </ref>. With respect to a steady state P, when it exists, the information gain in state P is defined by [P] = . . .

Reference-contexts: There are several other advantages to Eq. (5) over Eq. (3). Extrema and most probable states of M , &lt;&lt; M &gt;&gt;, are simply derived by a variational principle, similar to conditions sought in previous studies <ref> [59] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: force function Y (M G 1 g c G c G , the potential term -V , and the (negative) rate of change of entropy - S (M G G : Then L = f + Y - S - V is the nonlinear nonequilibrium generalization of the Onsager-Machlup Lagrangian <ref> [60] </ref>. The variational equations insure that the equilibrium entropy is maximal, not necessarily a static equilibrium.

Reference-contexts: can be developed into a scalar dynamic cost function, C, in terms of parameters, e.g., generically represented as C ( ~a ), C ( ~a ) = LDQ + 2 1 ln g , (10) which can be used with the ASA algorithm, originally called Very Fast Simulated Reannealing (VFSR) <ref> [61] </ref> discussed below [4], to find the (statistically) best fit of parameters. The cost function for a given system is obtained by the product of P's over all data epochs, i.e., a sum of C's is obtained. <p> Numerical Methodology Tw o major computer codes have been developed to calculate these algebraic models, which are key tools for the use of this approach to estimate model parameters and price bonds.

Reference-contexts: The annealing schedule for the temperatures (artificial uctuation parameters) T i decrease exponentially in time (cycle-number of iterative process) k, i.e., T i = T i0 exp (-c i k 1/D Heuristic arguments have been developed to demonstrate that this algorithm is faster than the fast Cauchy annealing <ref> [62] </ref>, T i = T 0 /k, and much faster than Boltzmann annealing [63], T i = T 0 / ln k.

Reference-contexts: The coarser resolution is appropriate, typically required, for numerical solution of the time-dependent path integral: By considering the contributions to the first and second moments of DM G for small time slices q , conditions on the time and variable meshes can be derived <ref> [66] </ref>. The time slice essentially is determined by q L , where L is the static Lagrangian with dM G /dQ = 0, throughout the ranges of M G giving the most important contributions to the probability distribution P.

Reference-contexts: This model was developed with some sound economic theory, but the methodology presented here of using the methods of modern calculus, e.g., using the path-integral representation to define a maximum likelihood cost function has not yet been recognized by this community <ref> [71] </ref>. The pioneering Brennan-Schwartz (BS) model [72,73] was used to illustrate how to numerically implement this methodology [2,53]. Since real time is used in this model, the variable t will be used instead of Q.
