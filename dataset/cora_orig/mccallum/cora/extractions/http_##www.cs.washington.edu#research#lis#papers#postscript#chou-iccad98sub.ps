Abstract: In traditional distributed embedded system designs, control information is often replicated across several processes and kept coherent by applicationspecific mechanisms. Consequently, processes cannot be reused in a new system without tailoring the code to deal with the new system's control information. The modal process framework provides a high-level way to specify the coherence of replicated control information independently of the behavior of the processes. Thus multiple processes can be composed without internal tailoring and without suffering from errors common in lower-level specification styles. This paper serves two purposes: to describe the synthesis of the mode manager, the runtime code that maintains control information coherence and to describe the semantics of modal process interaction.
