Abstract: We show in this paper that the AGM postulates are too week to ensure the rational preservation of conditional beliefs during belief revision, thus permitting improper responses to sequences of observations. We remedy this weakness by proposing four additional postulates, which are sound relative to a qualitative version of probabilistic conditioning. Contrary to the AGM framework, the proposed postulates characterize belief revision as a process which may depend on elements of an epistemic state that are not necessarily captured by a belief set. We also show that a simple modification to the AGM framework can allow belief revision to be a function of epistemic states. We establish a model-based representation theorem which characterizes the proposed postulates and constrains, in turn, the way in which entrenchment orderings may be transformed under iterated belief revision.

Reference-contexts: This paper addresses one such limitation, the failure of the standard belief revision framework, as encapsulated in the AGM postulates <ref> [1] </ref>, to properly regulate iterated belief revision, that is, the sequential revision of beliefs in response to a string of observations. We will first demonstrate that the AGM postulates, as they currently stand, are too permissive to enforce plausible iterated revisions, and need to be strengthened by additional constraints. <p> Alchourron, Gardenfors, and Makinson have proposed eight postulates to govern the process of belief revision, which are phrased in a very general setting and are known as the AGM postulates <ref> [1, 8] </ref>. Katsuno and Mendelzon (KM) rephrased these postulates assuming a propositional logic setting, yielding Postulates (R1)-(R6) that are shown below [17].

We show in this paper, however, that this strategy, too, is an excessive remedy to the AGM weakness and leads to counterintuitive results. <p> Therefore, once the total pre-order is known, Postulate (CB) together with the AGM postulates determine the total pre-order ffi completely. 4.2 Is Absolute Minimization Desirable? Absolute minimization of changes in conditional beliefs is due to Boutilier who suggested minimizing these changes as much as the AGM postulates permit <ref> [3] </ref>. In fact, Condition (CBR) is effectively Boutilier's definition of natural revision, and Postulate (CB) is a property that Boutilier has proven about his method of revision [3]. <p> Absolute minimization of changes in conditional beliefs is due to Boutilier who suggested minimizing these changes as much as the AGM postulates permit <ref> [3] </ref>.

Although Postulate (CB) rules out the counterintuitive revision scenarios discussed Section 2, the Postulate is somewhat of an overkill because it does compromise propositional beliefs.

Reference-contexts: at the epistemic state level [4, 19, 22, 15, 16, 7], the specific modification of the AGM postulates in the manner proposed above was inspired by recent studies of Freund and Lehmann who have effectively shown that (R1)-(R6) clash with one of the postulates, called (C2), that we propose later <ref> [6] </ref>. It turns out (Section 6), however, that Postulate (R4) alone is the culprit for the clash. Thus the problem arises whether one should retain Postulate (R4) and weaken (C2) or the other way around, weaken (R4) to uphold (C2).

But, first, we offer further rationale for weakening (R4) into (R ? 4). While several researchers have recognized the need to formulate revision at the epistemic state level <ref> [4, 19, 22, 15, 16, 7] </ref>, the specific modification of the AGM postulates in the manner proposed above was inspired by recent studies of Freund and Lehmann who have effectively shown that (R1)-(R6) clash with one of the postulates, called (C2), that we propose later [6]. <p> The operator is based on a proposal by Wolfgang Spohn for revising ordinal conditional functions, which can be viewed as representations of epistemic states <ref> [23, 8, 24, 22] </ref>. Spohn's method for belief change, called (; m)-conditionalization, can be interpreted as a qualitative version of Jeffrey's Rule of probabilistic conditioning [11, 12, 8].
