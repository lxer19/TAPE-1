Abstract: In order to perform powerful program optimizations, an exact interprocedural analysis of array data flow is needed. For that purpose, two new types of array region are introduced. IN and OUT regions represent the sets of array elements, the values of which are imported to or exported from the current statement or procedure. Among the various applications are: compilation of communications for message-passing machines, array privatization, compile-time optimization of local memory or cache behavior in hierarchical memory machines.
