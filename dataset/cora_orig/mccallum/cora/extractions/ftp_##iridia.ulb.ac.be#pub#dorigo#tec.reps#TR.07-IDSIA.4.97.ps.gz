Abstract: Technical report IDSIA-4-97, 1997 L.M. GAMBARDELLA, . D.

HAS-QAP is compared with some of the best heuristics available for the QAP: two taboo search versions, that is, robust and reactive taboo search, an hybrid genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing. Experimental results show that HAS-QAP and the hybrid genetic algorithm are the best performing on real world, irregular and structured problems, while HAS-QAP performance is not competitive on random, regular and unstructured problems. Key words: Quadratic assignment problem, ant colony optimization, ant systems, meta-heuristics. 1 . INTRODUCTION T h e q u a d r a t i c a s s i g n m e n t p r o b l e m The QAP is a combinatorial optimisation problem stated for the first time by Koopmans and Beckman 1 in 1957. It can be described as follows: Given two nn matrices (a ij ) and (b ij ), find a permutation p* minimising min ( ) = P n ij n n i j where P(n) is the set of permutations of n elements. Shani and Gonzalez 2 have shown that the problem is NP-Hard and that there is no e-approximation algorithm for the QAP unless P=NP. While few combinatorial optimisation problems can be solved exactly for relatively large instances, as exemplified by the travelling salesman problem (TSP), QAP instances of size larger than 20 are considered intractable. In practice, a large number of real world problems lead to QAP instances of considerable size that cannot be solved exactly. For example, an application in image processing requires to solve more than 100 problems of size
