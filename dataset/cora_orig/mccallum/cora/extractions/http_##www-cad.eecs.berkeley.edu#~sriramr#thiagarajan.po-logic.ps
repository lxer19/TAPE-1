Abstract: A basic result concerning LT L, the propositional temporal logic of linear time, is that it is expressively complete; it is equal in expressive power to the first order theory of sequences. We present here a smooth extension of this result to the class of partial orders known as Mazurkiewicz traces. These partial orders arise in a variety of contexts in concurrency theory and they provide the conceptual basis for many of the partial order reduction methods that have been developed in connection with LT L-specifications. We show that LTrL, our linear time temporal logic, is equal in expressive power to the first order theory of traces when interpreted over (finite and) infinite traces. This result fills a prominent gap in the existing logical theory of infinite traces. LTrL also provides a syntactic characterisation of the so called trace consistent (robust) LT L-specifications. These are specifications expressed as LT L formulas that do not distiguish between different linearizations of the same tarce and hence are amenable to partial order reduction methods.

His logic, denoted TLPO, has an awkward semantics and has both previous state and Since modalities. These past modalities are used extensively in the proof of the fact that TLPO is expressively complete when interpreted over finite traces. This proof does not extend to infinite traces.

Reference-contexts: This has been been an annoying gap in an otherwise smooth generalisation of the theory of !-sequences to the theory of infinite traces <ref> [GP92, EM93] </ref>. <p> The first order theory of traces as well as the syntax and semantics of LT rL are presented in section 3. This leads to the formulation of the main expressive completeness result and its corollaries. The major ingredients of the proof of the main result are: An observation in <ref> [EM93] </ref> that makes crucial use of [GPSS80], a decomposition result for infinite traces, an application of the Feferman-Vaught theorem for generalised products [FV59] and a new normal form linearisation of traces. <p> We note that in case I = ;, Theorem 1 is just the expressiveness result of [GPSS80] in a different and slightly weakened (because of the past modalities) form. As the first order theory of traces is decidable <ref> [EM93] </ref> and our translations are constructive we immediately obtain: Corollary 2 The satisfiability problem for LTrL is decidable. To bring out one more consequence of Theorem 1, we shall define LT L (), linear time temporal logic interpreted over -sequences. <p> This lemma constitutes the heart of the proof of Theorem 1. The main ingredients involved in establishing the lemma are an observation made in <ref> [EM93] </ref> and a new normal form linearization of traces. The first step is: Lemma 12 Let ' 2 F O (; I). <p> Then there exists a trace consistent ^ff 2 LT L () such that for every T 2 T R, T j= F O ' iff ; " j= ^ff for some linearization of T . As observed in a slightly different setting in <ref> [EM93] </ref>, this lemma follows easily from [GPSS80]. We now wish to exhibit a normal linearization of traces that can be described within LT rL (; I). As a result, we will be able to translate LT L ()-formulas into LT rL (; I)-formulas satisfied in the same normal linearisations.

The major steps in the proof are outlined in section 4. <p> Hence, first order theories of traces and disjoint unions of finite and infinite parts of traces are interreducible. Lemma 9 now follows from an application of the Feferman-Vaught theorem <ref> [FV59] </ref> in the very easy case of a disjoint union of two structures. Next we further break up the assertions concerning inf (T ) to mimic the decomposition described in Proposition 7.

Then L is F O-definable iff L is LT rL-definable. Indeed this result goes through in case L T R fin or L T R.

Reference-contexts: From a pragmatic standpoint, the "local" nature of the semantics of the logics that have been proposed so far makes it impossible to express arbitrary global liveness and safety properties. (More material on these issues can be found in the survey article <ref> [MT96] </ref>.) The temporal logic that we propose here, denoted LT rL, fulfils both 1 these criteria. It is expressively complete for (both finite and) infinite traces. And we can transparently express within LT rL, global liveness and safety properties of all kinds. <p> For achieving the present aims, there is no need for atomic propositions. It is worth mentioning that if one wishes to introduce atomic propositions then one has to restrict to valuations that respect the independence relation in a suitable fashion. The logic will become undecidable otherwise <ref> [MT96] </ref>. In the current framework, a model of LTrL is just a trace T = (E; ; ). The relation T; c j= ff will denote that ff 2 LTrL (; I) is satisfied at the configuration c 2 C T .
