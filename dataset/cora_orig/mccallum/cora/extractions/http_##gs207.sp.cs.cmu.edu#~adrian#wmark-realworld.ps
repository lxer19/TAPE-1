Abstract: Digital watermarking is a method of embedding identifying information in an image, in such a manner that it cannot easily be removed. An application of watermarking is copyright control, in which an image owner seeks to prevent illegal copying of the image. Commercial systems using such technology are now becoming available. In this paper we point out a number of the problems that watermarking faces as it moves into the "real world". We also examine weaknesses in the system of the current state-of-the-art methods that claim to provide digital image copyright protection. We will show how to overcome the shortcomings with respect to the real world and the entire digital image life cycle. Keywords: Analysis of digital image watermarking systems, copyright protection, intellectual property protection.

Reference-contexts: The power of such underground activity to create high quality watermark removal software should not be underestimated. 3 Technical problems of watermarking The Watermarking Process The technical challenge that watermarking presents is the successful concealment of the watermark signal in a much larger bandwidth medium. As <ref> [AP98] </ref> points out, usually we are more concerned with an attacker's ability to read or, worse, change or remove the watermark, than their ability to detect its presence. In the face of perfect compression methods, it is not clear that it is possible to conceal the presence of a watermark.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the UI becomes a crucial point in any security system. Legal issues Let's step away from UI concerns and let's take a look at another way the real world challenges image copyrighting. The scenario is the following: in a country that does not adhere to the Berne convention <ref> [Cin95] </ref> on copyright protection a malicious person sets up his webserver distributing copyrighted images, music, etc. There is no way to prevent this person from his "illegal" distribution as the country does not provide the legal basis for prosecution. All forms of intellectual property share this common problem. <p> This observation provides the foundation of the mosaic attack described in section 2. It should be noted that as image size drops, the concern about copyright violations also drops. Small text extracts from larger works are allowed for personal use under the copyright act <ref> [Cin95] </ref>. In music, samples of a couple of seconds or less, especially if they have been distorted in some way, are generally accepted as "fair use". Longer, more recognizable samples require copyright clearance. 3 Most of the literature on watermarks avoids mentioning this problem, because it seems obvious.

Reference-contexts: To check the image for a watermark, she can extract it. Relevance The early work on digital image copyright protection has focused on the creation of a secure and robust watermark only. Many groups are working on this problem, for further information consult <ref> [CMYY96, Dig97, PJ96, Mar96, CKLS96, Rua97, TvSO95, ZK94] </ref>. These works are mainly concerned about the algorithmic watermark issues and they only touch the deployment problems marginally. Later work has addressed some of the attacks on copyrighting systems. <p> This watermark will then also be invariant under these transformations. An often-used method for covert channel communication over a higher-bandwidth medium is spread spectrum communications. This method can also be applied to watermarking images, as described in <ref> [CKLS96, RDB96] </ref>. It has the advantage of having a long history in both military and civilian digital communications, and is thus both well understood and of proven reliability. At the current time, it appears the most promising framework for embedding watermarks in either images or other digital media data streams.

Reference-contexts: These works are mainly concerned about the algorithmic watermark issues and they only touch the deployment problems marginally. Later work has addressed some of the attacks on copyrighting systems. Cox and Linnartz have described in <ref> [CL97] </ref> the difficulties for implementing a rights management and copyright protection scheme for DVD's (digital versatile disk). They showed that it is possible to circumvent even sophisticated devices to get around the copyright Digital Image Watermarking in the "Real World" 3 protection. <p> Therefore that memory can also be read by another program and saved. Watermarking faces a similar problem: the image already has to be present somewhere in memory before the watermark can be extracted. Similar concerns are discussed with respect to DVD rights management in <ref> [CL97] </ref>. Another reason things look differently in the real world is that the systems are used in ways not foreseen by the system designers. <p> Attacks on Watermarks The possible attacks against watermarks are wide and varied. Cox and Linnartz <ref> [CL97] </ref> and Anderson et al [PAK98] present a number of such attacks, including: * Image modification attacks. These use image transformations such as those listed above. * Bit-level attacks. If the attacker has access to a watermark presence detector, the contents and location of the watermark can be derived.

Unfortunately we believe that the largest part of copyright infringement comes from access controlled sites. These problems present high barriers for any web-spider to overcome. Various schemes have been proposed to do rights management <ref> [Int97, Cox96] </ref>. Rights management is where the information distributor can give usage access rights to the client. For example he could declare that only viewing, not printing of the image is possible. This sounds feasible at first, but again, things look differently in the real world.

Digimarc proposed to set up a web-spider <ref> [Dig97] </ref> which would scan web-servers and search for watermarked images. This approach fails to work for the same reasons as stated earlier. The web-server simply refuses to send any stolen image to the Digimarc web-spider. <p> Every user registers the images to copyright at the copyright office.

But watermarks are still useful for discovering fraud on the network because of the difficulty of automatic comparison of images.

Reference-contexts: The systems are not used as intended in the research environment and hidden back-doors are exploited. This report shows the problems that current digital image watermarking schemes face. For the rest of this paper we will use the characters Alice, Bob and Mallory (as used in <ref> [Sch96] </ref>) to describe copyright protection scenarios. Alice in our case is the image creator and copyright holder and Bob is the Buyer of the image. In some other settings Alice and Bob always represent the righteous characters. <p> One of the greatest problems with commercial watermarking schemes is the difficulty in getting details on how these schemes work; for reasons of either competitive advantage or patent application, companies tend to keep their methods secret. This is "security through obscurity", a law called Kerkhoffs principle <ref> [Sch96] </ref>, and means the companies are relying to some extent on the difficulty of discovering their algorithm to foil attacks, rather than on the strength of some cryptographic key. This has proved foolish in the past.
