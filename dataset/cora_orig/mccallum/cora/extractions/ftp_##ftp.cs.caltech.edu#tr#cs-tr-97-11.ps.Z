Abstract: We present and illustrate a new technique, Image Correlation Supersampling (ICS), for resampling volume data that are undersampled in one dimension. The resulting data satisfies the sampling theorem, and, therefore, many visualization algorithms that assume the theorem is satisfied can be applied to the data. Without the supersampling the visualization algorithms create artifacts due to aliasing. The assumptions made in developing the algorithm are often satisfied by data that is undersampled temporally. Through this supersampling we can completely characterize phenomena with measurements at a coarser temporal sampling rate than would otherwise be necessary. This can save acquisition time and storage space, permit the study of faster phenomena, and allow their study without introducing aliasing artifacts. The resampling technique relies on a priori knowledge of the measured phenomenon, and applies, in particular, to scalar concentration measurements of fluid flow. Because of the characteristics of fluid flow, an image deformation that takes each slice image to the next can be used to calculate intermediate slice images at arbitrarily fine spacing. We determine the deformation with an automatic, multi-resolution algorithm.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many visualization tools assume that they can interpolate samples in an image or volume to create a continuous function over a region. Examples include marching cubes [Lorensen and Cline, 1987], which tri-linearly interpolates sample values to find isosurfaces, and standard image supersampling <ref> [Foley et al., 1990] </ref>, which uses various interpolation techniques to calculate pixel values between known ones. If the assumption that samples can be interpolated is not valid, the visualization algorithms will produce results with artifacts.

Reference-contexts: The undersampling and supersampling are in the vertical direction. Note the bumpy shapes introduced. The algorithm we apply, which is described in Section 2 and in more detail in <ref> [Gornowicz, 1997] </ref>, uses a multi-resolution deformation to characterize the change from one slice image to the next and automatically optimizes the deformation parameters at each level of resolution to find the appropriate deformation. <p> This work is based on Image Correlation Velocimetry (ICV) [Tokumaru and Dimotakis, 1995], an automatic technique for extracting velocity information from a series of images of concentration data.

Reference-contexts: Video compression techniques solve a similar problem. By using a predictive model of the deformation of one video frame to the next they can encode only the differences between a deformed version of an earlier frame and the current frame <ref> [Huang et al., 1996] </ref>. If the deformation is accurate, then the differences will be small and the resulting compression high. Because a failure in the deformation leads only to less effective compression, these techniques do not fail at representing the information if they are not robust, their compression rates degrade.

Reference-contexts: If the assumption that samples can be interpolated is not valid, the visualization algorithms will produce results with artifacts. The assumption is equivalent to assuming that sampled data satisfies the sampling theorem <ref> [Oppenheim et al., 1983] </ref>. The sampling theorem states that regularly spaced point samples of a function can be used to exactly reconstruct the function if and only if the function has no content above half the sampling frequency. While some types of data satisfy the sampling theorem, others do not.

Reference-contexts: For intermediate frames they both dissolve from one partially deformed image or volume into the second. Our technique differs primarily in that the deformation we calculate is physically motivated by the equations of fluid flow, and is found automatically rather than being interactively specified. A similar deformation-based technique <ref> [Ruprecht and M uller, 1994] </ref> defines correspondence points on different magnetic resonance images and calculates a deformation by attempting to deform the images to satisfy the correspondences. Our deformation has a more physical basis, and is parameterized and discovered differently. Video compression techniques solve a similar problem.

They are absent in 10 (a), the ICS image. 5 Discussion We have made some observations about ICS and its application while working to apply it to the example datasets. 5.1 Interpreting Image Displacements as Velocity The ICV algorithm <ref> [Tokumaru and Dimotakis, 1995] </ref> interprets the displacement field that it calculates as a velocity. For some cases, in particular where image intensities are constant within a region, the velocity is unconstrained, and so there are many possible solutions. This ambiguity leads to uncertainty in the velocities.
