Reference-contexts: These markers may indicate highlights or points where more study is needed for understanding. The instructor may use algorithm animation software for simulating textbook algorithms in classes, bringing to life concepts presented in a conventional textbook <ref> [Bro88, ea92] </ref>. The student becomes an active participant by tweaking the parameters while running the algorithms, instead of being a passive observer. Exams and quizzes may be administered electronically, followed by automatic grading, recording, and statistical analysis of the results. <p> They will be able to annotate the session just as their classmates did during the live session. Remote Tool Access: A suite of application programs such as simulation and visualization tools allow students to remotely participate in lab exercises <ref> [ea92, Bro88] </ref>. Eventually, virtual reality applications could provide students with even more powerful tools to enhance their understanding of material. Grader/Statistical Analyzer: An application to support quiz and exam giving, grading and record keeping will be used for exams, class feedback, and assignment submission and grading.

Reference-contexts: Though these methods have their successes, there are also limitations in their use and the effectiveness may not meet that of the classroom experience. One of the main limitations of the current distance learning model is the isolation of the students. In <ref> [CG87] </ref>, Chickering and Gamson with the support of other co-educators propose seven key principles for education: 1. Encouraging contacts between students and faculty. 2. Developing reciprocity and cooperation among students. 3. Using active learning techniques. 4. Giving prompt feedback. 5. Emphasizing time on task. 6. Communicating high expectations. 7. <p> Student-Student contact is even more limited since there are rarely any formal channels set up for any contact between remote students at different sites. But Chickering and Gamson <ref> [CG87] </ref>, along with many other educators, have identified student interaction as a key mechanism to enhance learning. Students who are able to hear other opinions and try out their own opinions outside of a formal setting deepen their understanding.

Reference-contexts: access the traditional classroom means of education by restrictions such as: * Time * Distance * Physical disabilities * Transportation limitations and expenses * Non-school commitments (e.g., children at home, job) In the fall of 1990, nearly 40% of all students in higher education in Minnesota were 25 or older <ref> [cro92] </ref>. Their education is more likely to be on a part time basis as a result of their other commitments and their limited ability to adapt their schedule to match that of a university.

Reference-contexts: In addition, students can participate in discussions or access other sources of information electronically through the Internet. Students may collaborate on group assignments <ref> [HC93] </ref>, work on individual projects, submit assignments electronically to instructor's computer account, and receive immediate acknowledgement back as the receipt for their submissions. Student researchers will have access to digital libraries and internet information servers to help them conduct their research.

Reference-contexts: Transparent access to on-campus student services complements the educational services described earlier, in an attempt to equalize the distance learner's experience to that of the traditional student. This area is not addressed in this paper. Current Environment Typical of the current environment is that described in <ref> [Hew93] </ref>. Microwave broadcast of the classroom audio and video is sent to remote sites equipped with a receiving dish. 5 Distance is limited in the range of 25-50 miles. Interaction is limited to audio by the student dialing a phone to connect to the broadcast room. <p> A conference call is set up and an analog signal is sent between the two sites. Again, any visual aids are shown through the camera and whatever focus qualities may be available. Experience shows that the interaction with the two-way audio-video capability significantly increases classroom interaction <ref> [Hew93] </ref>. UNITE Program Presently, University of Minnesota offers a distance learning program through the Institute of Technology called UNiversity-Industry Television for Education (UNITE). This program offers courses taught on-campus to 28 sites, representing 18 different companies with an average student enrollment of 267 student per quarter.

Reference-contexts: The establishment of digital libraries accessible by both instructors and students is a critical component of this environment. Existing information servers such as Gopher <ref> [Mar93] </ref> will be used to support access to Internet information and new servers will be built specifically to support access to the digital libraries.

Reference-contexts: An extension of the phone network is a probable means of achieving the access required <ref> [McE92] </ref>. Operating System Support: Operating systems will provide the realtime capabilities necessary for the support of live audio and video as well as efficient retrieval of stored continuous media. Support will also be provided for synchronization of multiple data streams. An integrated protection and accounting capability will be provided.

Reference-contexts: An on-line syllabus document will be enhanced with hypertext capabilities, having pointers to short descriptions of the material covered in each session. To prepare for a class session, the instructor will search, capture, and integrate material from a wealth of paper-based or computer-supported sources <ref> [MPTV92] </ref>. This material will include voice annotations, text, images, videos, graphs, and tables. Upon completion, the instructor may wish to notify the students of the availability of this material via group email messages or class-specific newsgroups announcements.

Reference-contexts: Optical tapes now exist that have a capacity of 100 gigabits and will hold 10-30 class sessions. A storage system consisting of optical tapes and multimedia servers will be capable of providing access to class sessions <ref> [Wel91, TP93] </ref>. Network Support: The high volume of data required of video media will be transported among multiple sites, geographically distributed, on a real-time basis. This data is not a single stream from a single source, but rather multiple streams from multiple sources.

Reference-contexts: Thirty programs are less than six years old indicating a growing need for this service <ref> [WS91] </ref>. New technology has changed the mechanisms and the capabilities that are possible for distance learning. Distance learning was originally available through mail order courses. As technology progressed, mailed paper documents were augmented first by audio tapes and later by video tapes.
