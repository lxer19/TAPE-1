Title: Approximation algorithms for facility location problems  
Author: David B. Shmoys Eva Tardos Karen Aardal 
Abstract: We present new approximation algorithms for several facility location problems. In each facility location problem that we study, there is a set of locations at which we may build a facility (such as a warehouse), where the cost of building at location i is f i ; furthermore, there is a set of client locations (such as stores) that require to be serviced by a facility, and if a client at location j is assigned to a facility at location i, a cost of c ij is incurred. The objective is to determine a set of locations at which to open facilities so as to minimize the total facility and assignment costs. In the uncapacitated case, each facility can service an unlimited number of clients, whereas in the capacitated case, each facility can serve, for example, at most u clients. These models and a number of closely related ones have been studied extensively in the Operations Research literature. We shall consider the case in which the assignment costs are symmetric and satisfy the triangle inequality. For the uncapacitated facility location, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a solution within a factor of 3.16 of the optimal. This is the first constant performance guarantee known for this problem. We also present approximation algorithms with constant performance guarantees for a number of capacitated models as well as a generalization in which there is a 2-level hierarchy of facilities. Our results are based on the filtering and rounding technique of Lin & Vitter. We also give a randomized variant of this technique that can then be derandomized to yield improved performance guarantees.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We shall present approximation algorithms for a variety of facility location problems. One of the most well-studied problems in the Operations Research literature is the uncapacitated facility location problem, dating back to the work of Balinski <ref> [2] </ref>, Kuehn & Hamburger [16], Manne [20], and Stollsteimer [25, 26] in the early 60's.

(For a review of the basics for this problem see, e.g., the textbook of Lawler <ref> [17] </ref>.)
