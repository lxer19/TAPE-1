Abstract: Dynamic Programming is one of the main methods of line detection. It defines a cost, which depends on local information, and performs a summation-minimization process in a graph or in the image. Fischler et al in particular presented an algorithm, called F*, which achieves important results (convergence, robustness, rapidity). In previous works, we proposed a mathematical formalization of the F*, which allowed us to extend the cost to cliques of more than two points, and to synthesize the needed information (contrast, grey-level, direction) in one unique cost function defined on the digital original image. In the present work, we show how to include curvature information in the cost by using neighborhoods of size larger than one, and we apply this energy to the recognition of roads and valleys in SPOT images.

We combine the advantages of both at the same time (rapidity, reliability and simplicity, versus use of curvature information). 5.4 Complexity The algorithms are performed within thirty or forty scannings, and the complexity is proportional to the number of pixels in the image.

Reference-contexts: We may implement the algorithm by performing scannings in the four directions, or by using a tree structure. In both cases, we avoid bottlenecks with the diagonals and optimize the propagation. Rightness of these both algorithms is proved in <ref> [9] </ref>. 4 Applications In the following three applications, we will denote by S 0 the set of starting points (used in Algorithm 1) and by S 1 the set of goal points (used in Algorithm 2). 4.1 Geologic image The original image is presented in Fig. 2 and the result obtained
