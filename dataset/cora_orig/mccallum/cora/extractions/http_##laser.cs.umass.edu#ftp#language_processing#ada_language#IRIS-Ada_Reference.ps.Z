Reference-contexts: Its name comes from the June 1989 Arcadia Language Processing Working Group (LPWG) meeting in Rockport, Massachusetts at which the LPWG ratified a new and substantially different version of IRIS-Ada, first presented by Incremental Systems in <ref> [INC-88-03] </ref>. The previous version of IRIS-Ada is described in [UCI-88-01]. Section 4 gives a detailed description of each declaration in the IRIS-Ada specification. The declarations appear in the same order as presented in [INC-90-01]. Section 5 presents a series of mappings from fragments of Ada code to IRIS-Ada structures.

Reference-contexts: It is intended to supplement the Incremental Systems reference manual <ref> [INC-90-01] </ref>. The IRIS Overview section of this document (sec.3) contains a brief discussion of the IRIS model, IRIS-Ada, and semantic analysis.

The IRIS Overview section of this document (sec.3) contains a brief discussion of the IRIS model, IRIS-Ada, and semantic analysis. The reader is advised to refer to [INC-90-01] for a more in-depth discussion of these topics. This document attempts to provide detailed descriptions and rationale for each declaration in the IRIS-Ada specification. The IRIS-Ada representation described in this document has been referred to as the Rockport version. <p> The previous version of IRIS-Ada is described in [UCI-88-01]. Section 4 gives a detailed description of each declaration in the IRIS-Ada specification. The declarations appear in the same order as presented in <ref> [INC-90-01] </ref>. Section 5 presents a series of mappings from fragments of Ada code to IRIS-Ada structures. The mappings are presented in Ada LRM [ALRM] order. Each depicts an Ada code fragment and its corresponding IRIS structure. <p> This section is provided as a quick visual reference. The definitive source for Ada to IRIS mappings is the IRIS-Ada grammar found in appendix B. Readers who are unfamiliar with the Incremental Systems grammar syntax are advised to consult <ref> [INC-90-01] </ref> for a formal description of the grammar. Section 6 provides cross references from each declaration to the Ada LRM and to its corresponding detailed description in section 4. Appendixes A and B contain listings of the Incremental Systems IRIS-Ada Specification and IRIS-Ada grammar respectively. <p> The reader is advised to refer to <ref> [INC-90-01] </ref> for more in-depth discussions of these topics. 3.1 IRIS IRIS (Internal Representation Including Semantics) was originated by David A. Fisher of Incremental Systems Corporation. It is a semantic- based, language independent internal form. Unlike some internal forms, such as Diana, IRIS separates internal structure from semantics. <p> The declarations are given in an Ada-like meta-language whose type structure provides a specification of the composition rules of the language. The IRIS-Ada grammar is found in appendix B. Both the Ada-augmented declarations and the IRIS-Ada grammar have been provided by Incremental Systems Corporation <ref> [INC-90-01] </ref>. second is a statement list and must be a list of elements of type statment. In the corresponding graphical depiction of the IRIS-Ada representation, application nodes are represented with rectangular nodes while reference nodes are represented with oval nodes.
