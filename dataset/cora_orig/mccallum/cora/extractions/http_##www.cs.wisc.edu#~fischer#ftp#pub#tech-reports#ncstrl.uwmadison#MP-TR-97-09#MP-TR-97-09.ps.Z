Title: Modeling and Solution Environments for MPEC: GAMS MATLAB  
Author: Steven P. Dirkse Michael C. Ferris 
Keyword: Complementarity, Algorithm, MPEC, Modeling  
Date: October 1997, Revised January 1998  
Abstract: We describe several new tools for modeling MPEC problems that are built around the introduction of an MPEC model type into the GAMS language. We develop subroutines that allow such models to be communicated directly to MPEC solvers. This library of interface routines, written in the C language, provides algorithmic developers with access to relevant problem data, including for example, function and Jaco-bian evaluations. A MATLAB interface to the GAMS MPEC model type has been designed using the interface routines. Existing MPEC models from the literature have been written in GAMS, and computational results are given that were obtained using all the tools described.

Reference-contexts: It is entirely equivalent to the box-constrained or rectangular VI. This allows a certain simplicity in formulation and solution. However, the formulation 3 is general enough to include as special cases the nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) where B := [0; +1] and nonlinear systems of equations where B := <ref> [1; +1] </ref>. The box B allows both free variables and variables with one or two finite bounds, hence the mixed nature of the problem. This results in improved efficiency of modeling and problem solution, as compared with the fixed box [0; +1] of the NCP.

Reference-contexts: These modeling languages help organize and automate the modeling task and allow this to be done in a machine- and solver-independent manner. In addition to GAMS, other modeling languages exist (e.g. AMPL [14], AIMMS <ref> [3] </ref>) that have a great deal in common. However, GAMS is currently the only one to support the mixed complementarity, or MCP [10], model type, although a similar AMPL interface [12] is currently under construction.

Reference-contexts: Those doing modeling work in complementarity are eager to adapt existing MCP models to take advantage of this framework. For example, one can optimize revenue or congestion in traffic equilibrium problems over a set of feasible tolls <ref> [9] </ref>, or convert a Nash equilibrium model to a Stackelberg (leader-follower) game [33]. Typically, the optimization problem has relatively few design variables and many more state variables.

Reference-contexts: We do not describe all of these models here, because most of them have been described elsewhere and due to the fact that we have made the GAMS source for these models available via the Web http://www.gams.com/mpec/.

In our computational work, we tested 6 distinct MATLAB codes: both the general and the NCP-constrained code were tested using a constant Q matrix for the QP subproblem, using an approximate Hessian of obtained via BFGS updating, and using a difference approximation to the Hessian. <p> There are a number of case where this occurred. For model oz3, the PIPA-B code was getting close to the optimal value of 4.999375 reported in <ref> [11] </ref>, but the same cannot be said of PIPA-M. Both of these algorithms had difficulty with the bilevel programs in fjq1 - fjq4, hitting the iteration limit before reaching a solution.

Reference-contexts: Both SolvOpt and the bundle code are implemented to run as GAMS subsystems, using the MPECIO library as their interface to GAMS. In order to test the MATLAB interface of Section 5, we obtained a prototype MATLAB implementation <ref> [19] </ref> of the penalty interior point approach (PIPA) code ([23], Chapter 6) from H. Jiang and D. Ralph. This code (that we call PIPA-N) is specialized for problems whose equilibrium constraints (2d) take the form of an NCP. <p> In some cases, problems had variables whose lower bounds could be shifted to 0, but more often there were free variables or variables with upper and lower bounds, so that a transformation into NCP form is much less appealing. Fortunately, we were able to obtain a second implementation <ref> [19] </ref> of PIPA (that we call PIPA-M) that allowed problems of the more general form minimize (x; y; w; z) subject to Ax b ` x u 0 w ? y 0 where x 2 R n , y; w 2 R m , z 2 R l , and F <p> The ralphmod model is a linear complementarity constrained MPEC with a quadratic objective, so the PIPA-N and PIPA-M codes use exact Hessians.

Reference-contexts: Those doing modeling work in complementarity are eager to adapt existing MCP models to take advantage of this framework. For example, one can optimize revenue or congestion in traffic equilibrium problems over a set of feasible tolls [9], or convert a Nash equilibrium model to a Stackelberg (leader-follower) game <ref> [33] </ref>. Typically, the optimization problem has relatively few design variables and many more state variables. This approach has implications for algorithm design, which can exploit the fact that the number of design variables and "side constraints" h and g is very small.
