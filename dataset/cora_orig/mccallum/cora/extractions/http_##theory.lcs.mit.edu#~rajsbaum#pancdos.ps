Abstract: Let T be a Hamiltonian tournament with n vertices and fl a Hamiltonian cycle of T . In this paper we develop a general method to find cycles of length k, n+4 2 &lt; k &lt; n, intersecting fl in a large number of arcs. In particular we can show that if there does not exist a cycle C k intersecting fl in at least k 3 arcs then for any arc e of fl there exists a cycle C k containing e and intersecting fl in at least k 2(n3) nk+3 2 arcs. In a previous paper [3] the

Reference-contexts: Similarly, a tournament T is arc-pancyclic if given any arc e there are cycles of every length containing e. It is well known that a Hamiltonian tournament is vertex-pancyclic, but not necessarily arc-pancyclic. In a previous paper <ref> [3] </ref> we introduced the concept of cycle-pancyclism to study questions such as the following. <p> Assume without loss of generality that fl = (0; 1; : : :; n 1; 0) is a Hamiltonian cycle of T . Let C k denote a directed cycle of length k. In <ref> [3] </ref> we proved that for k = 4; 5 and for every k, such that n &gt; 2k 5, there exists a cycle C k intersecting fl in at least k 3 arcs. <p> Proof: Notice that for l = 1, 0 r 2 it holds that 3 k 5. For these cases the theorem follows from <ref> [3] </ref>. When l = 1 we can assume that r &gt; 2. Therefore we can assume that the bounds of the theorem (k 2l, k 2l 1, k 2l 2) are at most k 4.
