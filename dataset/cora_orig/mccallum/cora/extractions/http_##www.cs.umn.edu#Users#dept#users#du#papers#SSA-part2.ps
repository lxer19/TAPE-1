Abstract: Two emerging serial storage interfaces, Serial Storage Architecture (SSA) and Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL) are studied in this paper. The advantages of these two emerging standards include (1) simple cabling system (serial instead of parallel), (2) higher bandwidth, (3) capable of connecting a large number (more than one hundred) of disks, (4) fault tolerance and (5) fair accesses on the channel. We intend to find the performance limitations and characteristics of these two interfaces. We have investigated the performance of both SSA and FC-AL in terms of latency, overhead and aggregate throughput under three types of traffic load: light, heavy and based on a trace log from a database application. We have also studied the fairness algorithms of SSA and FC-AL. The results presented in this paper not only enhance our knowledge of SSA and FC-AL, but can also be used to effectively utilize the two technologies for potential applications.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the communications between the initiator and all other disks (from bN=2c+1 to N) go through the right part of the loop. (See In the SSA simulation model, the interleaving of special characters and the application frames is simulated as specified in the standard draft <ref> [1] </ref>. We assume the initiator is capable of transmitting frames to both output ports and receiving frames from both input ports simultaneously. We also assume that the bandwidth between the interface and the cache is always fast enough to forward the frames from interface buffer to the disk buffer.

Reference-contexts: FC-AL is a loop architecture which can have any combination of hosts and storage devices up to a total of 127. With 100 MBytes/sec bandwidth, the loop structure enables the rapid exchange of data between devices. As an enhancement to the Fibre Channel standard <ref> [5] </ref>, FC-AL is capable of using either copper cables for low-cost connections or optical cables for longer distance connections (up to 10 km with single-mode fiber optics). FC-AL can be used together with a Fibre Channel switch to form a distributed storage system.

Reference-contexts: The disk model is based on an IBM Ultrastar XP 4.51 GB disk. The detailed disk parameters are given in <ref> [9] </ref>. This IBM disk employs zone bit recording [10]. The disk is divided into different zones. The same recording density is used in each zone. Since outer zones are wider in space than inner zones, more data can be stored in outer zones than inner zones.
