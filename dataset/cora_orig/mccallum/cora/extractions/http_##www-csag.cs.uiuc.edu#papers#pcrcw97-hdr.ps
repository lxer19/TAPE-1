Abstract: In recent years, the topic of quality of service (QoS) has garnered much discussion and research amongst network designers. QoS has many definitions, but here we focus on the notion of predictable communication performance such as guaranteed bandwidth and maximum latency. Such predictability not only supports continuous media (e.g. audio, video, virtual reality) and interactive response (e.g. client response time, real-time control), but also good parallel application performance. We discuss three major approaches for quality of service and evaluate their match for high performance system-area networks. We classify the wealth of approaches to network quality of service into three classes: virtual circuits, physical circuits, and global scheduling. These approaches differ significantly in their assumptions about the network environment and in how they bind communication tasks to physical resources, how physical resources are multiplexed and scheduled, and what information is available to do so. These choices fundamentally affect the cost, complexity, and performance of each approach. Virtual circuit approaches attain the greatest flexibility, but require complex hardware for implementation. Physical circuit approaches reduce hardware complexity, but need research to understand to best exploit them to deliver quality of service. Finally, we discuss two promising avenues for combining external control with simple network switches to deliver both low cost and high performance (route based and time-based global scheduling). These approaches are in their infancy and many research questions remain about their capabilities and generality.

Reference-contexts: The remaining time can be scheduled flexibly (ensuring no output contention), enabling flexible use of most of the network capacity. To demonstrate the viability of this approach, we are building a prototype 5 which works in the context of Myrinet <ref> [1] </ref>. This prototype has already demonstrated self-synchronization at the granularity of two kilobyte packets and can preserve this synchronization at a traffic overhead of less than 1%. More specifically, delivery can be guaranteed with a latency of approximately 20 microseconds, application to application.

Reference-contexts: By giving higher priority to the packet with a lower virtual clock value, VC guarantees the reserved bandwidth to each virtual circuit, independent of packets' arrival order. Several algorithms share the basic idea with VC, including Fair Queueing <ref> [5] </ref> and Packet-by-Packet General Processor Sharing (PGPS) [15]. Also, many researchers presented more practical algorithms which reduce implementation complexity by approximating QoS, for instance, SCFQ [7, 16] and FFQ [19]. With network efficiency sacrificed, network QoS can be achieved at a much lower complexity.

Reference-contexts: Because local-area bandwidth is mostly limited by router and link speeds, simplicity in design can be traded against efficient link management. 4 Simple, non-working-conserving mechanisms are not considered because they have limited applications. Recently, Tandem introduced the ServerNet routers <ref> [9] </ref>, which implement a novel architecture for network-resource control called ALU-biasing arbitration. <p> The special hardware in one NIC may negotiate with that on other NICs explicitly or implicitly to acquire and use network resources. 5.1 Route-based Route-based approaches to global scheduling use the mapping of logical connections onto physical resources to control network performance <ref> [17, 9] </ref>. While this is conceptually similar to virtual circuits, route-based global scheduling differs in that physical network links are not virtualized by the switches. Rather, the sharing is controlled by selecting routes at the network interface.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, this approach wastes precious network bandwidth, so can support limited applications (e.g., pure CBR traffic) only. Recently, the authors presented a compromising approach, called Rotating Combined Queueing (RCQ) <ref> [11, 10] </ref>. RCQ is also work-conserving but requires only a small number of queues independent of the number of supported virtual circuits and also reduces scheduling complexity using a larger control granularity (frames). <p> Compared to other work-conserving virtual circuit algorithms, RCQ provides similar QoS to end users for most multimedia applications. More detailed surveys on virtual circuit-based algorithms can be found in <ref> [20, 10] </ref>. 3.3 QoS Performance Many existing networks and most networks in the near future need to support a wide range of applications which will require different traffic characteristics and communication services. <p> under intermixed traffic loads for different scheduling algorithms: First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Stop-and-Go (SG), Virtual Clock (VC), ALU-biasing (ALU), and Rotating Combined Queueing (RCQ). observe that FCFS and ALU networks (this scheduling algorithm is discussed 3 More general interactions of different traffic types for a range of scheduling algorithms are presented in <ref> [10] </ref>. in Section 4) provide significantly larger delay bounds than others, increasing in proportion to load rates. In these networks, CBR packets can be blocked by packets from bursty traffic coupled via shared physical links and buffers. <p> Its analysis and simulation study results on bandwidth guarantee are not provided here due to space limitation, but can be found in <ref> [10] </ref>. Instead, this section discusses additional benefits of such a low-complexity scheduling mechanism, focusing benefits for traditional multicomputer applications. <p> Either QoS given to a communication path depends on other traffic streams to some extents or an excessive amount of bandwidth is required to compensate the coupling effect. This coupling effect makes fine-grain traffic control difficult, especially in large-scale networks <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Traditionally, workloads have been viewed as requiring only best-effort, and optimization for maximum throughput and minimum latency for a wealth of traffic patterns and message size distributions has been the goal. However, recent study of such best-effort applications indicates that predictable communication performance can improve their performance <ref> [12] </ref>. Further, emerging use of cluster systems for online interactive applications both as traditional information resources (online databases) and revolutionary information infrastructure (e.g. web servers, electronic commerce, etc.) is now driving a different set of concerns.

Reference-contexts: Example: FM-QoS We are building a time-based global scheduling system which delivers communication quality of service for cluster networks, called FM-QoS. This system builds on the API for low-overhead cluster communication called Fast Messages (FM) <ref> [14] </ref>, but exploits novel low-level mechanisms to pro-vide network synchronization. To provide network synchronization, FM-QoS uses a mechanism called feedback-based synchronization (FBS), which exploits link-level flow control to determine whether the local clock is too fast.
