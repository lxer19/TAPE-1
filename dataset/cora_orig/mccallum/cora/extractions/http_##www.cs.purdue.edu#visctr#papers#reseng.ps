Title: Mechanism Comparison and Classification for Design

Abstract: When designing new devices, engineers seldomly start their design from scratch. Instead, they redesign or compose existing ones. Finding candidate devices based on their properties is thus an essential design subtask. To be effective, future intelligent CAD systems must be able to compare and evaluate existing devices. Due to the large number of known devices, such systems must create and maintain a devices' knowledge base indexed by the properties of the devices. This paper presents a new method to compare and classify mechanical devices according to their kinematic properties. Mechanism comparison determines when two mechanisms are kinematically equivalent. Mechanism classification organizes classes of equivalent mechanisms for efficient retrieval. Both tasks require describing mechanisms' behaviors from various perspectives and at multiple levels of abstraction. To produce such descriptions, we develop a set of operators to simplify and abstract kinematic descriptions derived from configuration spaces. Simplification operators ignore irrelevant information by incorporating constraints and assumptions. Abstraction operators ignore detail by defining multiple levels of resolution. The resulting hierarchy supports the design process throughout its evolution, from the conceptual to the detailed phase. It provides an explicit link between behavioral specifications and part geometry.

Reference-contexts: Two relations are monotonically identical iff they both specify the same relation (, =, or ) and their functions are both simultaneously increasing or decreasing in the given interval. For example, y x and y x 2 are monotonically identical in the interval x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and monotonically different in the interval [1; 0]. Motion predicates need not be all identical. <p> For example, y x and y x 2 are monotonically identical in the interval x 2 [0; 1] and monotonically different in the interval <ref> [1; 0] </ref>. Motion predicates need not be all identical. For example, to distinguish between objects that move and objects that don't regardless of their motion type, we define two categories: no-motion, consisting of the motion type f ixed, and motion, consisting of all the other motion types.

Reference-contexts: First, Input-Part simplification reduces R 0 to a set of disjoint two-dimensional strips bounded by the linear relations A i and A i + * in the interval B 2 <ref> [; 2] </ref>. Only two strips, i = 0 and , are reachable from the initial placement. As a consequence, only the regions adjacent to these two strips are reachable in the interval B 2 [0; ]. All other regions are unreachable and are thus discarded. <p> p rotation (A; O A ; A ) p rotation (B; O B ; B ) A 2 [i:; (i + 1):] mod2 B 2 [0; ] mod2 FREE: fixed (A; O A ; A ) p rotation (B; O B ; B ) A = i: mod2 B 2 <ref> [; 2] </ref> mod2 T (MESH,FREE): A = (i + 1): B = To summarize, the continuous rotation of the half gear intermittently turns the other gear half a turn in the opposite direction. 3.2 Global operators Global operators simplify and abstract kinematic descriptions of complete mechanisms. <p> They are commonly described the region diagram: RIGHT: p rotation (W; O W ; ) p translation (S; O S ; X) 2 [0; ] mod2 X 2 [0; X max ] LEFT: p rotation (W; O W ; ) p translation (S; O S ; X) 2 <ref> [; 2] </ref> mod2 X 2 [X max ; 0] T (RIGHT,LEFT): = mod2 X = 0 where X max , O W and O S are parametric values standing for the axes of the driving wheel and the slider.
