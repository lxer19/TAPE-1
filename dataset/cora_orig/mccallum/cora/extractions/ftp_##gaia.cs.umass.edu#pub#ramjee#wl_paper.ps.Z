Abstract: Cellular networks are expected to be upgraded to offer Personal Communication Services (PCS). The mobility management and wireless call control approach used in cellular networks are currently being proposed for use in PCS networks. Recent work indicates that both the signaling load and database update rates caused by these mobility management and call control procedures will increase significantly in the next generation PCS networks. In this paper, we propose and analyze a new cluster-based architecture and define algorithms to effectively handle mobility management and call control functions for PCS. We assume an ATM network infrastructure. Some of the key aspects of our proposal include simplifying the mobile location and tracking function, performing connection setup in segments, eliminating the need for user service profile downloads between networks, and more efficient routing of connections by removing the need for an anchor switch. Advantages of this approach include a reduction in signaling traffic load, improved call/connection setup delays, and more efficient routing of connections (no wasted bandwidth). We carry out an analysis of our solution for high-tier PCS applications.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Wireless cellular networks are expected to be upgraded to support multimedia personal communication services. The IS-41 <ref> [1] </ref> and GSM [2] standards describe MAP (Mobile Application Part) signaling messages and the procedures used to track mobile location, locate mobiles for call delivery, and to perform handoffs. These are used in conjunction with SS7 (Signaling System No. 7) ISUP (ISDN User Part) messages for establishing and releasing calls.

Reference-contexts: Research indicates that both the update rates at location registers and the signaling load on the network will be significantly higher for PCS than for cellular or ISDN calls. For example, the analysis in <ref> [3] </ref> indicates that the HLR (Home Location Register) experiences a high update rate of 749 updates per second for PCS. <p> Current cellular networks have the following characteristics: 1. During registration, the user service profile is downloaded from the HLR (Home Location Register) to a VLR (Visitor Location Register) based on a mobiles current location <ref> [3] </ref>. During call delivery or registration, the MSC (Mobile Switching Center) obtains the users service profile from its VLR in order to provide signaling services for the mobile user. 2. There is no explicit mobile location phase before call/connection establishment for calls identified as being delivered to mobiles. <p> The radio-port utilization is given by: EQ 11 where is the rate and the service time for a job of class . 5.2 Input Data The input assumed for the analysis is shown in Table 3. Some of this data is obtained from <ref> [3] </ref>. Table 4 shows the additional input data needed for the server and radio-port utilization analysis. This data includes only the application processing times and are based on call processing service times listed in [16]. <p> The significant differ ence in the update rates at the home location server (36/sec) in our architecture and the HLR update rate reported in <ref> [3] </ref> (i.e. 749/sec) is because we allow for multiple home location servers in our procedures instead of having just one HLR 1 . In Figure 15, we show the sensitivity of the connection server utilization to varying operation ser 1. <p> In Figure 15, we show the sensitivity of the connection server utilization to varying operation ser 1. In addition, our input data is slightly different from the data in <ref> [3] </ref>. We assume a larger number of users and high-velocity mobiles. We also include updates due to mobiles powering on and off.

Reference-contexts: The functions performed by a call server are cumulatively referred to as call control. For initial applications, the call control functions include: (1) maintaining the BCSM (Basic Call State Model) as defined in Intelligent Networks <ref> [10] </ref>) for a call 1 , and triggering implicit services, such as 800-number, or services subscribed to by the users, such as call-forwarding; and (2) handling multiple connections 2 per call, be it multiple audio connections, multiple data connections, or a mixture of audio and data connections.

Reference-contexts: Call/connection release procedures are described in Appendix A. In cellular networks, MAP messages, carried over TCAP (Transaction Capabilities Application Part) of SS7 <ref> [11] </ref>, are used for mobility management functions (registrations, mobile locations and handoffs). Connections are routed through switches via a hop-by-hop procedure using the ISUP (B-ISUP for ATM networks) protocol of SS7. In our approach, we continue to use MAP messages (with possibly redefined parameters) for mobility management functions.

Reference-contexts: This improves connection setup delays for calls being delivered to mobiles. Other alternative approaches to improve this delay and reduce signaling load have been proposed. For example, <ref> [12] </ref> proposes caching the identity of the VLR in the originating (calling partys) switch and thus sending the mobile location request directly to the VLR for subsequent calls, thus bypassing the HLR. On cache misses and for first calls, a query to the HLR is still required in this approach.

Reference-contexts: Call/connection arrival and release processes are Poisson. 7. Clusters are square in shape. 8. The roaming mobiles of a network are uniformly spread across the other networks. Some of the assumptions listed above may need to be relaxed for actual network designs. For example, <ref> [14] </ref> shows that heterogeneous cells may be characteristic of future networks, which is counter to our first assumption. Since the purpose of this analysis is not to perform actual network design, but to demonstrate the impact of different parameters of various measures, we make the above-listed assumptions for simplicity.
