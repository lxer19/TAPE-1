Abstract: The complexity of circuit designs has necessitated a top-down approach to layout synthesis. A large body of work shows that a good layout hierarchy, or partitioning tree, as measured by the associated Rent parameter, will correspond to an area-efficient layout. We define the intrinsic Rent parameter of a netlist to be the minimum possible Rent parameter of any partitioning tree for the netlist. Experimental results show that spectra-based ratio cut partitioning algorithms yield partitioning trees with the lowest observed Rent parameter over all benchmarks and over all algorithms tested. For examples where the intrinsic Rent parameter is known, spectral ratio cut partitioning yields a partitioning tree with Rent parameter essentially identical to this theoretical optimum. These results have deep implications with respect to both the choice of partitioning algorithms for top-down layout, as well as new approaches to layout area estimation. The paper concludes with directions for future research, including several promising techniques for fast estimation of the (intrinsic) Rent parameter.

Reference-contexts: Because minimum-cut bisection divides module area evenly, it is a popular objective within the hierarchical layout paradigm. However, the area bisection requirement is unnecessarily restrictive and can preclude finding natural structure within the circuit. Various ad hoc thresholds and penalty functions (e.g., the r-bipartition formulation of Fiduccia and Mattheyses <ref> [10] </ref>) have not been completely successful in relaxing this constraint. With this in mind, the ratio cut formulation [42] provides a more straightforward tradeoff between nets cut and evenness in the partition: the numerator captures the minimum-cut criterion while the denominator favors near-bisection. <p> These methods are generally too CPU-intensive to be used as the basis of area estimation and thus lie beyond the scope of our discussion. 10 Mattheyses <ref> [10] </ref> and Krishnamurthy [25].

Reference-contexts: This result has key implications in two areas. First, it affirms previous work of Wei and Cheng [43], who were the first to propose the ratio cut metric as a partitioning objective, and of Hagen and Kahng <ref> [15] </ref>, who proposed using the spectral approach for ratio cut partitioning. Second, our work naturally leads to the development of better predictive layout models, enabling a more efficient search of the space of layout solutions. <p> It is well known that both minimum-cut bisection and minimum ratio cut are NP-complete [13], so heuristic methods must be used. Previous approaches fall into several classes, as surveyed in [6] <ref> [15] </ref> [29]. 9 The greedy iterative paradigm is popular either as a stand-alone strategy or as a postprocessing refinement to other methods. <p> In general, these previous works formulate the partitioning problem as the assignment or placement of nodes into bounded-size clusters or chip locations. The problem is then transformed into a quadratic optimization, and a Lagrangian formulation leads to an eigenvector computation. 10 In <ref> [15] </ref>, Hagen and Kahng established a close relationship between the optimal ratio cut cost and the second smallest eigenvalue of the matrix 10 A prototypical example is the work of Hall [18], which we now outline. <p> This result suggests that the eigenvector x corresponding to , i.e., the solution of the matrix equation Qx = x, be used to guide the partitioning. For ratio cut partitioning, <ref> [15] </ref> used x to induce a linear ordering of the modules, and the best "split" in terms of ratio cut cost was returned. <p> The spectral method is appealing for its use of global rather than local information, and it moreover provides an inherently spatial embedding of the circuit graph. Because the spectral approach significantly outperforms iterative Fiduccia-Mattheyses style methods <ref> [15] </ref>, Section 4 uses the spectral ordering as the basis for ratio cut partitioning variants. 11 4 Experimental Results and Discussion 4.1 Experimental Procedure Within the preceding taxonomy, the main classes of partitioning algorithms of interest for top-down layout generation and area estimation are greedy iterative methods (in particular, Fiduccia-Mattheyses minimum-subject <p> The minimum eigenvalue 0 gives the uninteresting solution x = (1= p p p and hence the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue is used. 11 While eigenvalue computations are not cheap, the run-times reported in <ref> [15] </ref> were actually less than those for the multiple F-M computations needed by, e.g., the RCut1.0 program of Wei and Cheng [43]. Significant algorithmic speedups stem from the need to calculate only a single (the second smallest) eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix. <p> On the other hand, Struct is an array multiplier with a mesh-like topology, meaning that its 12 The computation time required for spectral-based partitioning is slightly more than that for FM-based partitioning <ref> [15] </ref>. Thus, for each of FM-1/4 and FM-Bis, we compensate for this CPU difference by reporting the minimum Rent parameter over 10 independently generated partitioning trees. 13 intrinsic Rent parameter is likely to be 1/2. <p> As an aside, it is also possible that Monte Carlo methods which examine random root-leaf paths in the partitioning tree may similarly be applied to reduce the number of bipartitions computed.

Our second speedup is based on the observation in <ref> [15] </ref> that the sorted second eigenvector used by the SpecRC partitioning algorithm provides a "uniformly good" ordering of the netlist modules. In other words, after we bipartition a circuit using the sorted second eigenvector of its Laplacian, there is no compelling reason to independently reorder the two resulting subcircuits. <p> It has been established <ref> [15] </ref> that the eigenvector-based heuristic ratio cuts (U jW ) will in practice have cost very close to the theoretical lower bound of n jUjjW j provided in Theorem 1 (recall the discussion of Section 3).

Reference-contexts: in mind, we now list three research directions (two of which are specific to the SpecRC class of algorithms) that offer potential speedups to our methodology. 14 We note that in practice, a single execution of spectral ratio-cut partitioning is significantly faster than 10 executions of the Fiduccia-Mattheyses algorithm, e.g., <ref> [16] </ref> cites 83 sec of Sun Sparc-1 CPU time for the eigenvector computation in the top-level bipartitioning of Primary1, while 10 FM executions required 204 sec of CPU time.

Reference-contexts: It is therefore tempting to speculate that a relationship exists between (i) the second-smallest eigenvalues encountered as SpecRC is used in Generate-Partition-Tree, and (ii) the intrinsic Rent parameter of the circuit. Preliminary experimental results and heuristic justifications presented in <ref> [17] </ref> to support such a proposed relationship were at best inconclusive. However, we believe that exploration of a possible "lambda-Rent" relationship is one of the more far-reaching open questions that stem from the present work.

The Rent parameter <ref> [28] </ref> characterizes a power-law relationship between the number of external terminals of a subcircuit in the layout and the number of modules in the subcircuit. <p> This relation was first observed by E. F. Rent of IBM in the late 1960s and independently by several others, e.g., Donath [4] derived the same relation from a stochastic model of a hierarchical design process. Landman and Russo <ref> [28] </ref> performed an extensive study of the relation via partitioning experiments on large "real-life" circuits, and observed Rent parameter values p between 0.47 and 0.75. 1 Following Mandelbrot [30] and Keyes [21], one may view Rent's rule as a dimensionality relationship between pinout of a module and the number of gates <p> In our work, as in <ref> [28] </ref>, we consider scaling laws fitted to the region I domain (cf. the discussion in Section 4.1 below). <p> Therefore, before we can use the Rent parameter as a quality measure for partitioning algorithms, we find it necessary to extend and solidify the original methodology sketched by Landman and Russo in <ref> [28] </ref>. 3 Some confirmation of these models was provided by Kurdahi and Parker [26], who compared the accuracy of both Feuer's and Sastry's results using serial multipliers as a testbed. <p> These neighborhood analysis methods are also reported to be quite effective, even though they rely solely on local wire length estimates. 5 2.2 Defining the Intrinsic Rent Parameter Landman and Russo <ref> [28] </ref> made the fundamental observation that "the" Rent parameter will depend upon both the structure of the circuit and the partitioning algorithm chosen. This notion of an algorithm-dependent Rent parameter motivates our hypothesis that the Rent parameter can be used to characterize the quality of a given partitioning algorithm. <p> The early work of Landman and Russo <ref> [28] </ref> computed "the" Rent parameter of a circuit as follows. By using a multi-way partitioning algorithm, Landman and Russo could generate partitioning instances P i , each of which corresponded to a partition of the entire circuit into disjoint subcircuits. <p> Finally, given that Generate-Partitioning-Instances has output m partitioning instances P 2 ; : : : ; P m , we apply the methodology described in <ref> [28] </ref> to divide these instances into two regions: Region I, where Rent's rule applies, and Region II (corresponding to the few top-most levels of the partitioning tree), where the rule breaks down. <p> For example, the standard approach in the literature <ref> [28] </ref> [34] has been to generate partitioning instances using a breadth-first traversal of the partitioning tree, i.e., to group all the subcircuits at distance one from the root into a partitioning instance, then all of the subcircuits at distance two into another partitioning instance, etc.

Reference-contexts: Several standard transformations <ref> [29] </ref> may be used to convert H into a graph G = (V; E) with vertices and edges of G weighted to reflect module areas and the multiplicity or importance of connections. <p> It is well known that both minimum-cut bisection and minimum ratio cut are NP-complete [13], so heuristic methods must be used. Previous approaches fall into several classes, as surveyed in [6] [15] <ref> [29] </ref>. 9 The greedy iterative paradigm is popular either as a stand-alone strategy or as a postprocessing refinement to other methods. <p> These methods are generally too CPU-intensive to be used as the basis of area estimation and thus lie beyond the scope of our discussion. 10 Mattheyses [10] and Krishnamurthy [25]. Practical implementations will use a number of random starting configurations and return the best result <ref> [29] </ref> [42] in order to adequately search the solution space and give predictable performance, or "stability". For example, Wei and Cheng [42] propose a ratio cut heuristic that adapts the shifting and group swapping methods of [10] and returns the best of 20 runs.

Reference-contexts: Landman and Russo [28] performed an extensive study of the relation via partitioning experiments on large "real-life" circuits, and observed Rent parameter values p between 0.47 and 0.75. 1 Following Mandelbrot <ref> [30] </ref> and Keyes [21], one may view Rent's rule as a dimensionality relationship between pinout of a module and the number of gates in the module. <p> First, the experimental results in [5] show a large difference between the predicted and actual values of r; however, r was generally found to vary up or down in accordance with the proposed model. Second, Donath's model has obvious ties to the "dimensional" intuition noted above <ref> [30] </ref> [21] [27]: Donath assumes that circuit layouts are two-dimensional, and the "critical value" of p = 1 2 in (2) corresponds to the transition between planar and non-planar circuits.

Reference-contexts: Three researchers in particular - Donath [5], Feuer [9] and Sastry [36] <ref> [35] </ref> have proposed and experimentally verified relationships between the Rent parameter and the average wire length of a layout. Together, these works show that a lower Rent parameter will result in lower average wire length, which in turn generally implies smaller wiring area and less congestion in the layout. <p> While the model does not accomodate values of p 1=2, it should be noted that such low values of p are rarely observed in real layouts [26]. Finally, the Ph.D. thesis of Sastry <ref> [35] </ref> also assumes a continuous model of logic and uses techniques from reliability theory to derive a relationship between Rent's rule and the wire length distribution. The main result is that if Rent's rule holds, the wire lengths of a layout will follow a Weibull distribution. <p> It was found that the two methods of [9] and <ref> [35] </ref> are of similar quality, e.g., Feuer's estimates of the average wire lengths are within 23% of the actual values, using a "default" value of p = 0:720 as the Rent parameter. 4 Wirelength estimates also lie at the heart of the analytic area estimation methods used in synthesis; see, e.g., <p> average wire lengths are within 23% of the actual values, using a "default" value of p = 0:720 as the Rent parameter. 4 Wirelength estimates also lie at the heart of the analytic area estimation methods used in synthesis; see, e.g., El Gamal [12], Heller [8], Kurdahi [27] and Sastry <ref> [35] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Early theoretical work connecting graph spectra and partitioning is due to Barnes, Donath and Hoffman [1] [6] [7]. More recent eigenvector and eigenvalue methods have dealt with both module placement (Frankle and Karp [11] and Tsay and Kuh <ref> [41] </ref>) and graph min-cut bisection (Boppana [3] and Blanks [2]). In general, these previous works formulate the partitioning problem as the assignment or placement of nodes into bounded-size clusters or chip locations.

Reference-contexts: Various ad hoc thresholds and penalty functions (e.g., the r-bipartition formulation of Fiduccia and Mattheyses [10]) have not been completely successful in relaxing this constraint. With this in mind, the ratio cut formulation <ref> [42] </ref> provides a more straightforward tradeoff between nets cut and evenness in the partition: the numerator captures the minimum-cut criterion while the denominator favors near-bisection. It is well known that both minimum-cut bisection and minimum ratio cut are NP-complete [13], so heuristic methods must be used. <p> These methods are generally too CPU-intensive to be used as the basis of area estimation and thus lie beyond the scope of our discussion. 10 Mattheyses [10] and Krishnamurthy [25].

Reference-contexts: Moreover, with each test case for which the intrinsic Rent parameter is known, the spectra-based ratio cut partitioning tree has Rent parameter essentially identical to the theoretical lower bound. This result has key implications in two areas. First, it affirms previous work of Wei and Cheng <ref> [43] </ref>, who were the first to propose the ratio cut metric as a partitioning objective, and of Hagen and Kahng [15], who proposed using the spectral approach for ratio cut partitioning. <p> x = (1= p p p and hence the eigenvector corresponding to the second smallest eigenvalue is used. 11 While eigenvalue computations are not cheap, the run-times reported in [15] were actually less than those for the multiple F-M computations needed by, e.g., the RCut1.0 program of Wei and Cheng <ref> [43] </ref>. Significant algorithmic speedups stem from the need to calculate only a single (the second smallest) eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix.
