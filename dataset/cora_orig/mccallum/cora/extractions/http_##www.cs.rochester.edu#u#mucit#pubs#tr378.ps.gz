Abstract: Selecting the right reference class and the right interval when faced with conflicting candidates and no possibility of establishing subset style dominance has been a problem for Kyburg's Evidential Probability system. Various methods have been proposed by Loui and Kyburg to solve this problem in a way that is both intuitively appealing and justifiable within Kyburg's framework. The scheme proposed in this paper leads to stronger statistical assertions without sacrificing too much of the intuitive appeal of Kyburg's latest proposal.

Reference-contexts: For instance, if it knew that the red berries that it has statistics about were in fact both red and soft, it could safely disregard the conflicting 2 statistics about soft berries <ref> [ Kyburg, 1983 ] </ref> . <p> If, on the other hand, there are conflicts between the intervals, we cannot establish dominance using Kyburg's original rules <ref> [ Kyburg, 1983 ] </ref> since we do not have the necessary information about the subset relationships. One could give up and return the interval [0; 1] or resort to constructing various subsets of the cross products of the candidate reference classes.

While professing ignorance is a virtue, one should also be able to 6 make the best of available information. As is the case with Kyburg's method in <ref> [ Kyburg, 1991 ] </ref> , the reference class associated with the interval we return can be any one of the candidate classes associated with the constituents of the cover.
