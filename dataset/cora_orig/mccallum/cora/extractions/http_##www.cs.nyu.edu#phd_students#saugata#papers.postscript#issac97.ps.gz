Abstract: In this paper we introduce a variant of the quantifier elimination problem for the first order theory of real closed fields. Instead of considering a single quantified formula, we consider a uniform sequence of such formulas and eliminate quantifiers to obtain another uniform sequence. Our immediate motivation comes from a problem in the theory of constraint databases with real polynomial constraints. Using the uniform quantifier elimination algorithm, we give an algorithm for converting a query with natural domain semantics to an equivalent one with active domain semantics. A non-constructive version of this result was proved in [2]. Very recently, a constructive proof was also given independently in [5]. In the last part of the paper, using some elementary tools from first order logic and results described above, we prove that parity is not expressible in the constraint query language over the reals. This was proved by Benedikt et al [2]. However unlike ours, their proof uses difficult techniques from non-standard analysis and model theory of ordered structures.

Reference-contexts: If, however, some of them are finite then if there is at all a common point it must be one of these points. The theory of p-adic fields is another interesting theory admitting quantifier elimination. The definable subsets (see <ref> [7] </ref> for terminology and details) are unions of a finite collection of finite cells and possibly an infinite cell. The number of finite cells is again uniformly bounded by the parameters of the defining formula. Moreover, if two finite cells inter sect, one contains the other.

They proved that parity is definable over the natural numbers or the ra-tionals, with addition and multiplication. However, the theories for these structures are undecidable. <p> However, 0 n contains no additions or multiplications. This would imply that parity is expressible in hN; i (i.e in a discrete order without end-points) which is not true (see <ref> [14] </ref>). 7 Concluding Remarks In this paper we have introduced a new variant of the quantifier elimination problem which we call uniform quantifier elimination. We give an algorithm for performing uniform quantifier elimination and analyse its complexity.
