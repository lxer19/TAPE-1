Abstract: We consider the Helmholtz equation with a discontinuous complex parameter and inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions in a rectangular domain. A variant of the direct method of cyclic reduction is employed to facilitate the design of improved multigrid components, resulting in the method of CR-MG. We demonstrate the improved convergence properties of this method.

Reference-contexts: Effective and efficient microwave heating depends very much on a detailed knowledge and understanding of the dielectric properties of the food to be processed. This need has given rise to extensive research into the dielectric properties of materials; see, for example, Tinga and Nelson <ref> [1] </ref>. Microwave heating can be compared to heating by alternating current. The electric field of alternating current changes direction approximately 100 times each second, whereas the microwave field changes direction approximately 5 billion times each second. The heating effect is accomplished by energy transfer to dipoles, most commonly water. <p> The value of ffi in 2 is a typical value calculated from the data in <ref> [1] </ref>. In the following experiment we assess the efficiency of the CR-MG algorithm, as described in the preceding section, and compare it with standard MG using full weighting restriction and nine-point prolongation.

Reference-contexts: Operator Definitions Before attempting to solve this problem by the multigrid method, we need to carefully consider the definitions of the discretisation, restriction and prolongation operators. In <ref> [2] </ref>, De Zeeuw considers the solution of general linear second order elliptic partial differential equations over similar domains. He notes that the rate of convergence of standard multigrid methods often deteriorates when the coefficients in the differential equation are discontinuous; he proposes matrix-dependent grid transfer operators to overcome these difficulties.

Reference-contexts: A popular approach for solving complex linear systems is to solve the equivalent real linear systems for the real and imaginary parts of u. However, the following remarks, due to Freund <ref> [3] </ref>, cast doubt on this approach. Suppose that A is a general complex m fi m matrix.

Reference-contexts: As the name suggests, the function of a multigrid smoothing method is to reduce the rough (high frequency) components of the error as efficiently as possible. This is basically a local task and so the smoothing efficiency of a method can be analysed by local Fourier mode analysis <ref> [4] </ref>, neglecting interactions with boundaries. The smooth (low frequency) error components are reduced on the coarser grids. There is a natural distinction between high and low frequencies depending on the type of grid coarsening chosen. Essentially, the low frequencies are those which are visible on the coarser grids. <p> The error at the boundary is always zero and so we define a new set of rough frequencies as fi D The corresponding Fourier smoothing factor is defined by D := max j ( ; )j : This is a mesh-dependent definition. A mesh-independent definition, introduced by Brandt <ref> [4] </ref>, is obtained by replacing the discrete set fi with a continuous analogue, but this is more difficult to compute numerically and gives less realistic results in cases where the type of boundary condition has much influence.

Reference-contexts: There is a natural distinction between high and low frequencies depending on the type of grid coarsening chosen. Essentially, the low frequencies are those which are visible on the coarser grids. In principle, smoothing methods need not be convergent (see <ref> [5] </ref>, chpt 7), although in practice most are. Consider the discrete analogue of problem (1), Au = f , defined on a mesh of n fi n intervals.

Reference-contexts: The influence of Dirichlet boundary conditions can be taken into account heuristically (see <ref> [6] </ref> and [7], for example) in the following way.

Reference-contexts: The influence of Dirichlet boundary conditions can be taken into account heuristically (see [6] and <ref> [7] </ref>, for example) in the following way. The error at the boundary is always zero and so we define a new set of rough frequencies as fi D The corresponding Fourier smoothing factor is defined by D := max j ( ; )j : This is a mesh-dependent definition. <p> There are many possibilities for the choice of smoothing method (see <ref> [7] </ref>, for example), but for brevity we consider only two, point Gau-Seidel iteration (PGS) and Kaczmarz iteration (KACZ). <p> Only two smoothing methods have been considered here, point Gau-Seidel and Kaczmarz. However, there are many more robust smoothers, such as alternating damped Jacobi, alternating symmetric line Gau-Seidel and incomplete LU decomposition. These methods, and many more, have been summarised and analysed in detail in <ref> [7] </ref>. Improvements in the convergence properties of the modified multigrid method (CR-MG) will almost certainly be realised by using such smoothers. Finally, attention in this paper has been restricted to the microwave oven problem, although the ideas presented here can be extended to other problems.

Reference-contexts: There are many possibilities for the choice of smoothing method (see [7], for example), but for brevity we consider only two, point Gau-Seidel iteration (PGS) and Kaczmarz iteration (KACZ). The latter of these two methods, dating back to 1937 <ref> [8] </ref>, is considered here because, when applied to the complex linear system Au = f , the method converges for all distributions (A) of eigenvalues of A.

For tridiagonal systems which represent approximations to 1-D second order ordinary differential equations, CR is as efficient as multigrid (MG). For problems in higher dimensions CR becomes too computationally expensive due to fill-in within the blocks.

Reference-contexts: For problems in higher dimensions CR becomes too computationally expensive due to fill-in within the blocks. However, the design of MG methods in higher dimensions can be facilitated by drawing comparisons between MG and CR (see Shaw <ref> [11] </ref>). Approximate Cyclic Reduction Consider the system of equations Lu = f . If v is an approximation to the true solution u, then we define the error vector as e := u v and the residual vector as r := f Lv = Le. <p> Improvements in the convergence properties of the modified multigrid method (CR-MG) will almost certainly be realised by using such smoothers. Finally, attention in this paper has been restricted to the microwave oven problem, although the ideas presented here can be extended to other problems. For example, in <ref> [11] </ref>, these ideas were applied to the convection-diffusion equation and it was shown that approximate cyclic reduction can be used to define the ideal quantity of coarse grid artificial viscosity and the direction in which it lies.

Reference-contexts: Then assuming that the error vector e is sufficiently smooth (a condition normally guaranteed by a few applications of a smoother in a MG algorithm), the fill-in can be minimised by making accurate Taylor expansion approximations of the outlying errors. This method is known as approximate cyclic reduction (ACR) <ref> [12] </ref>. Now consider a two-grid method applied to a two-dimensional Toeplitz system. Suppose the two grids have mesh sizes h and H = 2h and the fine grid matrix has stencil L h ~ 6 b b 7 where a and b are scalars.

Reference-contexts: However, the adjoint of the five-point restriction operator (5) is not a reasonable prolongation (see <ref> [13] </ref>, p. 78). Alternative definitions of the prolongation operator are discussed in the following subsection. ACR and the Helmholtz Equation Consider a two-grid method, with mesh sizes h and H = 2h, applied to the fine grid Helmholtz differential operator L h u := r 2 u + ffiu.

Reference-contexts: There are various ways to define the prolongation operator. Possibilities include seven-point and nine-point prolongation <ref> [14] </ref>. However, a more effective definition of the prolongation operator for this interface problem is P h 1 2 4 4p 3p 2 4p 3 5 ; which is derived from the tensor product of the one-dimensional ACR-modified prolongation operator.
