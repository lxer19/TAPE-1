Abstract: A technique for wire tension measurement in the CMS End Cap Muon chambers is suggested, combining acoustic excitation of the wire vibration and resonance detection with an infrared optical device, which solves the problem of different wire signal cross-coupling. The technique could be used for wire winding and fixation quality assurance at the stage of mass production of the cathode strip chambers.

Reference-contexts: Hence, control of the wire tension in the course of the CSC mass production is a crucial step of quality assurance. Various techniques have been used by various groups to measure wire tension <ref> [1] </ref>. All of them are based on measuring a normal frequency f of wire vibration which is related to the tension T , wire length l and mass per unit length as T = 4l 2 f 2 in the case of the first normal frequency [2] .
