Reference-contexts: For those preliminary results, no attempts have been made at specializing this algorithm to the particular structure of (8). Our experimental design follows closely that of Bajgier and Hill <ref> [1] </ref>. The discriminating points are drawn from multivariate normal populations with variable dispersion parameters ( X ; Y ; X ; Y ), sample sizes r, s and space dimension n. Table 1 shows the combinations used for the actual experiments.

(c) In the reverse convex case, the strong NP-completeness of DP1 follows from the strong NP-completeness of the maximum norm problem (see Freund and Orlin [7] or Bod-laender et al. <ref> [2] </ref>). 2 Corollary. The existence or non-existence of a discriminating hyperplane can be determined in polynomial time. Proof. From theorem 3, part (b), there follows that the existence of a discriminating hyperplane can be determined by solving for the existence of a feasible solution to one of n linear systems.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we follow an altogether different approach (see also Cavalier et al. <ref> [3] </ref>). We do not assume any functional form for the distributions F X and F Y . Actually we do not even assume the points x i and y j to be random. <p> If no such hyperplane exists, we look for a hyperplane H such that the maximum distance of any misclassified point to the hyperplane H be minimized. In both cases, the hyperplane H is determined by solving the mathematical programming problem (see Cavalier et al. <ref> [3] </ref>) p;a;w s.t. p t x i + a w i 2 I = f1; : : : ; rg kpk 2 (1) where the nonlinear constraint kpk 2 2 = 1 ensures that p t x i + a and p t y j + a represent the euclidian distance

Reference-contexts: When fx i g i2I and fy j g j2J are random samples drawn from multivariate normal populations with respective means X and Y and common variance-covariance matrix , it can be shown that the optimal hyperplane is given by the formula (see Fisher <ref> [4] </ref>): p t z + a = 0 where p = 1 ( X Y ) 1 ( X + Y ) 1 ( X Y ) ln ( ae and ae and 1 ae are prior probabilities assigned to populations X and Y respectively.

Reference-contexts: This result will be obtained by polynomial (actually linear) reduction of the closed densest hemisphere problem (CDH), whose NP-completeness has been proved by Johnson and Preparata [13], to DP2. The closed densest hemisphere problem, in its satisfiability form, can be stated as (see Garey and Johnson <ref> [8] </ref>): Given a set W of m points in R n , does there exist a vector q in R n and a scalar b such that at least L points in W lie on the same side of (or on) the hyperplane H = fq t z = 0g, i.e.:

Reference-contexts: Ignoring this constraint is tempting since the resulting relaxed program is linear (see Freed and Glover [5][6], Glorfeld and Gaither <ref> [9] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: In the reverse convex case, we solved DP1 using a code initially designed for solving linear bilevel programming problems (see Hansen et al <ref> [11] </ref>). This algorithm implements ideas of logic programming within a Branch-and-Bound scheme and converges to a global optimum in finitely many steps.

Reference-contexts: This result will be obtained by polynomial (actually linear) reduction of the closed densest hemisphere problem (CDH), whose NP-completeness has been proved by Johnson and Preparata <ref> [13] </ref>, to DP2. <p> Algorithm 2-POL can be generalized to problems in R n to yield an O ((r + s) n lg (r + s)) algorithm, following the lines developed previously and the recursive procedure mentioned in the paper by Johnson and Preparata <ref> [13] </ref> for the densest hemisphere problem. However such algorithms are not competitive with implicit enumeration schemes in high dimensions, as we will see. 3.4 Numerical results.

Reference-contexts: Proof. (a) In the strictly convex case, the result follows from the existence of polynomial algorithms for the monotone linear complementarity problem which constitutes an extension of the convex quadratic programming problem (see Kojima et al. <ref> [14] </ref>). (b) In the linear case, there must exist a nonzero vector p and a scalar a such that the set of linear inequalities p t x i + a 0 i 2 I is satisfied.

Reference-contexts: Solution algorithms are based on theorem 1, which states the equivalence between DP1 and quadratic programming.
