Abstract: Introduction: The complexity of the modern information carrying landscape requires a sophisticated view in which information is acquired rather than simply retrieved; where the process must be dynamic, incremental, and constrained by resource limitations. Information Gathering (IG) is an activity involving pro-active acquisition of information, from possibly heterogeneous sources, in response to a complex query that may require the system to possess capabilities such as reasoning, representation and inferencing. In this paper, we present a model of information gathering designed specifically for such complex environments, a model of Cooperative Information Gathering (CIG). In addition to the complexity of query specification, control of the acquisition process may itself be complex and dynamic in IG systems. Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) is a limited sub-case of such information gathering systems in which queries generally map onto static, pre-specified retrieval plans. In this paper, we propose a cooperative agent-based solution for information gathering. Top level queries drive the creation of partially elaborated information gathering plans, resulting in the employment of multiple semi-autonomous, cooperative agents for the purpose of achieving goals and subgoals within those plans. Cooperation between agents implies management of interdependencies between their activities so as to integrate and evolve consistent clusters of high quality information from distributed heterogeneous sources. This paper draws upon a long history of thought in Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) to present a model of this type of cooperative information acquisition. Problem Solving: The task of information gathering in a distributed setting can be viewed in general terms as either distributed processing or distributed problem solving. Distributed processing is appropriate when subproblems are independent and agents need nothing other than local information to arrive at a subproblem solution of the required quality that can be synthesized with other agent subproblem solutions to arrive at a global solution. Distributed problem solving, on the other hand, is characterized by the existence of interdependencies between subproblems leading to a need for the agents to cooperate extensively during problem solving. Lesser [ Lesser, 1991 ] presents the functionally accurate, cooperative (FA/C) paradigm as an approach to distributed problem solving. In FA/C systems, various soft and hard constraining goal/task interrelationships among subproblems motivate agents to augment their local information with information about global problem solving activity in order to enhance the efficiency of the ongoing problem solving process. Once uncovered via communication of problem solving activities, such as receiving partial results or meta-information, these interdependencies can be exploited in a variety of ways to improve problem solving both locally and globally. In a CIG task, potentially useful constraints may exist between different pieces of information. The discovery and exploitation of such constraints is necessarily a dynamic and incremental process that occurs during problem-solving and entails communication of partial results among agents in a timely and selective manner, to augment each agent's local view with a more global view. Given the incomplete nature of the local views of the individual agents, another important aspect of FA/C is the explicit recognition of the role of solution and control uncertainty. Coupled with the fact that resources and time for conducting a search are limited in real-life problems, this leads to the notion of satisficing search. Another aspect of FA/C is the explicit recognition and exploitation or avoidance of redundancy, leading to increased robustness
