Abstract: A Quantum Computer is a new type of computer which can efficiently solve complex problems such as prime factorization. A quantum computer threatens the security of public key encryption systems because these systems rely on the fact that prime factorization is computationally difficult. Errors limit the effectiveness of quantum computers. Because of the exponential nature of quantum computers, simulating the effect of errors on them requires a vast amount of processing and memory resources. In this paper we describe a parallel simulator which accesses the feasibility of quantum computers. We also derive and validate an analytical model of execution time for the simulator, which shows that parallel quantum computer simulation is very scalable.

Reference-contexts: This is an important problem because a quantum factoring engine would severely threaten the security of public-key cryptosystems. The quantum factoring algorithm uses quantum parallelism to calculate all of the values of a function simultaneously. This function is periodic and a quantum FFT can extract this period efficiently <ref> [Copp94] </ref>. We then use a polynomial time classical algorithm to calculate the factors from this period. Quantum computers are also useful for searching unsorted databases [Grov96]. The quantum search algorithm runs in time for items, where the best classical algorithm runs in time. <p> A schematic of a circuit for factoring the number 15 is shown in Figure 5, where we use rotation gates to prepare the superposition state. The function f (A) is periodic, and we can extract this period by performing a quantum FFT on the amplitudes in the A register <ref> [Copp94] </ref>. Figure 4 shows a plot of the function f (A) where X=7 and N=15.

Reference-contexts: A QU-bit is like a classical bit in that it can be in two states, zero or one. The QU-bit differs from the classical bit in that, because of the properties of quantum mechanics, it can be in both these states simultaneously <ref> [FeLS65] </ref>. A QU-bit which contains both the zero and one values is said to be in the superposition of the zero and one states. The superposition state persists until we perform an external measurement. <p> The bit value of a state corresponds to the index of that state in the vector. The simulator represents each encoded bit value with a non zero amplitude in the state vector. The probability of each state is defined as the square of this complex amplitude <ref> [FeLS65] </ref>. is equally split between the zero and one states, representing a QU-bit which is in the superposition state. For a register with M QU-bits, the simulator uses a vector with 2 M states.

Reference-contexts: This function is periodic and a quantum FFT can extract this period efficiently [Copp94]. We then use a polynomial time classical algorithm to calculate the factors from this period. Quantum computers are also useful for searching unsorted databases <ref> [Grov96] </ref>. The quantum search algorithm runs in time for items, where the best classical algorithm runs in time. Therefore for NP-complete problems such as circuit SAT, which contains items for m variables, the quantum algorithm runs in O (2 m/2 ) time.

We implemented the simulator in C and use the MPI message passing library to communicate between processors <ref> [MPI94] </ref>. The parallel simulator allows the simulation of circuits which are three to four orders of magnitude larger than any current proposed experimental realizations of a quantum computer [TuHo95][MoMe95]. The remainder of this section gives a brief introduction to quantum computers.

Reference-contexts: A less detailed model, which we have shown is very accurate, uses only two states for each QU-bit and therefore represents an exponential reduction in complexity <ref> [ObDe97] </ref>. 2.1 Simulation of Quantum Logic Gates The simulator implements each gate as a sequence of transformations on the vector space which represents the QU-bits in the computer. In general, for a quantum computer with a vector space of size V, we describe each operation with a VxV transformation matrix. <p> In order to extract the period from the quantum calculation, Shor suggests using 2L + 1 bits for the input register A [Shor94], but we have shown that an accurate simulation can be achieved using only L + 1 bits for A <ref> [ObDe97] </ref>. (EQ 1) The circuit also requires two additional scratch registers to write the intermediate results of the additions and multiplications. The number of QU-bits required to factor an L bit number using this circuit is therefore, 4L + 4. <p> There are two factor-15 benchmarks, one which uses 9 bits in the A register, and one which uses only 3. We have shown that the three bit factor-15 circuit is a good approximation of the 9 bit circuit <ref> [ObDe97] </ref>. The factor-21 and factor-35 benchmarks factor five and six bit numbers respectively. The total number of basic operations needed in a simulation is proportional to the number of states multiplied by the number of laser operations.
