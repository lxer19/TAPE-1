Title: Minimising the Energy of Polypeptides by Simulated Annealing

Abstract: This paper presents an approach for deriving 3-D structures of polypeptide chains which have minimum energy. The well-known op-timisation algorithms are usually applied on the model which contains hard constraints over coordinates of the atoms. The drawback of such strategies is an inefficient search for the optimum solution. Our approach proceeds in two steps: first, the standard model is transformed into an equivalent model without hard constraints, and second, an algorithm is performed by combining simulated annealing and first- and second-derivative techniques. The empirical results demonstrate that the hybrid algorithm on the proposed model outperforms traditional search algorithms especially with respect to running times.

Reference-contexts: The main reason for the long execution time is usually a "bad" initial solution for the convergent derivative procedures. Our approach is based on the minimisation of the energy of polypeptides using simulated annealing which is one of well-known stochastic local search algorithms <ref> [1] </ref>. The most important difference with other local search algorithms is that simulated annealing attempts to avoid poor local optimum solutions, hence it offers hope of obtaining significantly better results.

Reference-contexts: An important characteristic of each protein structure is the minimum energy among atoms.

Unfortunately, the running time to derive 3-D structures is still very long and the algorithms do not prove optimality of the derived solutions.

Reference-contexts: The result of the algorithm is the structure of a given protein. 3.1 Constraint interval reasoning In our approach we have applied a constraint interval technique on the original coordinate representation of the atoms in cycles. The technique performs the arc-consistency algorithm <ref> [5] </ref> and it is not limited to linear constraints. The arc-consistency algorithm reduces the real domains of variables (if it is possible) without losing any solution of the problem. The variables get reduced to narrow ranges. <p> On these problems three algorithms have been performed: * the specialised CHARMM algorithm * constraint programming using interval reasoning and the branch-and bound search (see the `ria' library in ECLiPSe3.5.2 <ref> [5] </ref>) * our hybrid algorithm represented in Section 3 Performing the hybrid algorithm, the results on the cyclic polypeptide `gagaa' show that a set of 200 solutions for the cyclic part can be derived in less than 10 seconds.

Reference-contexts: We never move to a new solution unless the direction is downhill, that is, to a better value of the cost function. An example of local optimisation algorithms is the hill-climbing search. Simulated annealing is an approach, developed by Kirkpatrick, Gelatt and Vecchi <ref> [6] </ref>, that attempts to avoid entrapment in a poor local optima by allowing an occasional uphill move. This is done under the influence of a random number generator and a control parameter, the temperature.
