Title: Segmental Modeling Using a Continuous Mixture of Non-parametric Models

Abstract: The aim of the research described in this paper is to overcome the modeling limitation of conventional hidden Markov models. We present a segmental model that consists of two elements. The first is a nonparametric representation of both the mean and variance trajectories, which describes the local dynamics. The second element is some parameterized transformation (e.g., random shift) of the trajectory that is global to the segment and models long-term variations such as speaker identity.

Reference-contexts: An alternative approach is segmental modeling, where the basic modeling unit is not a frame but a phonetic unit. This family of models relaxes the assumptions of both stationarity and independence within a state, typical of standard HMMs. Deng et al. <ref> [1] </ref> used a regression polynomial function of time to model the trajectory of the mean in each state. A nonparamet-ric description of the mean trajectory was suggested by Ghitza and Sondhi [4]. <p> The following models were examined: 1. An HMM having a mixture of Gaussians. Such a model with s states and m mixtures is denoted by HMM (s,m). 2. A segmental polynomial model <ref> [1] </ref> with deterministic coefficients. Such a model with s states and a polynomial of order K describing the mean trajectory of each state is denoted by POLY (s,K). 3. A segmental random polynomial model [7] with multinormal coefficients.

Reference-contexts: Our model was motivated by extensive examination of segment data realizations. In Fig. 1, several realizations of the first cepstral coefficient in the triphone ih-s-ow are presented (The database used was the speaker-independent, large-vocabulary, Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus <ref> [2] </ref>). The data is presented after nonlinear time warping of the segment realizations, so as to achieve time alignment between the various realizations. We now present recognition and training algorithms for the new proposed model. The input to the recognition algorithm is a segment realization. <p> Note that because mean trajectory time warping is allowed, segmentation inaccuracies at the previous stage can be tolerated. Experimental Results We evaluated our model by using the ARPA large-vocabulary, speaker-independent, continuous-speech, Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus <ref> [2] </ref>. Experiments were conducted with DECIPHER, SRI's continuous speech recognition system [3]. Our model was implemented using the N-best re-scoring paradigm, by re-scoring the list of the N-best sentence hypotheses generated by DECIPHER. Context-dependent phonetic models were used.

Reference-contexts: Deng et al. [1] used a regression polynomial function of time to model the trajectory of the mean in each state. A nonparamet-ric description of the mean trajectory was suggested by Ghitza and Sondhi <ref> [4] </ref>. More recently, Kimball [6], suggested an approach that models each segment by a discrete mixture of nonparametric mean trajectories. In this paper we propose a new random segmental model.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we propose a new random segmental model. The main idea of random models is to consider the mean trajectory not as fixed parameters but as a random variable that is sampled on each state arrival. Russell and Holmes <ref> [5] </ref> proposed a random extension of the model suggested by Deng, by assuming a parametric segmental model with random coefficients. We suggest here a random nonpara-metric approach. Our proposed model is compared to alternative segment models by using a triphone recognition task.
