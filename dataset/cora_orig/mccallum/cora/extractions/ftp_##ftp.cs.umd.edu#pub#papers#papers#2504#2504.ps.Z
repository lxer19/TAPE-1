Reference-contexts: The solution can then be obtained by solving the equation 0 U b 1 subject to the normalization condition 1 T = 1: (1:5) Our chief concern is with the effect of rounding errors on this algorithm. We note that A is a singular M-matrix <ref> [2] </ref> and diagonally dominant [cf. (1.4)]. The results of the standard rounding-error analysis of Gaussian elimination show that the growth is bounded by one (see, e.g., [7, p.151], for the definition of the growth).

Reference-contexts: A relative error of order unity is thus incurred in this diagonal element. It should be stressed that the solution of the above problem is well determined and can be obtained through other methods, e.g., aggregation methods [8]. The failure is in Gaussian elimination itself. Grassmann, Taksar and Heyman <ref> [5] </ref> have proposed a modification of Gaussian elimination which is claimed to give accurate solutions for NUMCs. The modification is based on the following observation. Let A be partitioned in the form A = @ A 11 A 12 1 so that A 11 is a nonsingular M-matrix. <p> It is easy to verify that this adjustment gives the correct solution in the above example. Unfortunately, we are unable to show whether the simple diagonal elements correction suggested in <ref> [5] </ref> will work for NUMCs with a large number of states. In this note we are going to show that a related algorithm with diagonal pivoting will work for NUMCs with a large number of states.

Reference-contexts: However, the theory assumes that the sums of the columns of the perturbation are exactly equal to zero. When this condition is violated, even slightly, the solution becomes quite sensitive to perturbations (see test problem 4 discuessed in <ref> [6] </ref>). To see the failure of Gaussian elimination, we consider an example where the transition matrix is P = B @ 2 * 1 1 1 * * 1 2* C A : Suppose * is less than the machine precision.

Reference-contexts: We note that A is a singular M-matrix [2] and diagonally dominant [cf. (1.4)]. The results of the standard rounding-error analysis of Gaussian elimination show that the growth is bounded by one (see, e.g., <ref> [7, p.151] </ref>, for the definition of the growth). Moreover, the backward errors have the same structure as A, only they are smaller by a factor proportional to * M . At first glance this would seem to be an encouraging result. <p> To look at th rounding errors involved in Step 1 of the algorithm, we rewrite the matrix ^ A in element-wise notation; i.e., let ^ A = (ff ij ): Following the analysis in <ref> [7, p.410-411] </ref> and noticing that jff ij j = jff ij (k) ff kk (k) = jff ij j + j (k) ff kk (k) we have that the backward rounding errors introduced in the (i; j)-elements for i 6= j by the elimination are of the form c * M

Reference-contexts: The rounding errors thus introduced are at most of order ** M . Moreover, the final upper triangular has positive diagonals (except the last one which is set to zero) and nonpositive off-diagonals. The solution of such a system is computed to high accuracy <ref> [11, p.249-251] </ref>. Therefore, we can assume that the computed vector 2 of ^ 2 satisfies [( ^ N + ffi ^ N) + ( ^ Z + ffi ^ Z)] 2 = 0; where ffi ^ N and ffi ^ Z are matrices of order ** M . <p> : Note that the rounding errors introduced in the back substitution have been neglected in the above equality because the solution of the corresponding upper triangular system is computed to high accuracy by the fact of the favorable signs of elements in the upper triangular and the right hand side <ref> [11, p.249-251] </ref>.
