Abstract: Strategic directions for research in real-time and embedded computing systems are presented. Included in the discussion is the need for research in open real-time systems, globally distributed real-time systems, and multimedia systems. Specific research problems are also discussed for various areas of real-time and embedded computing, including system evolution, composibility, software engineering, the science of performance guarantees, reliability and formal verification, general system issues, programming languages, and education. Each of these areas has special problems when real-time and embedded systems constraints are involved.
