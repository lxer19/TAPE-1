Abstract: Treating constrained problems with EAs is a big challange to the field. Whether one considers constrained optmization problems or constraint satisfaction problems, the presence of a fitness function (penalty function) reflecting consraint violation is essential. The definition of such a penalty function has a great impact on the GA performance, and it is therefore very important to chose it properly. In this paper we show that ad hoc setting of penalties for constraint violations can be circumvented by using self-adaptivity. We illustrate the matter on a discrete CSP, the Zebra problem, and show that the penalties learned by the GA are to a big extent independent from the applied genetic operators as well as from the initial constraint weights.
