Reference-contexts: What we need to do is to make the tag depend on the whole message. One way to do this is to define MAC (x) as a prefix of def where f is some underlying block cipher. This method is a pervasively used international and U.S. standard. In <ref> [BKR] </ref>, it is proved secure. 3.4.2 The GGM Scheme Here is another way to make the MAC be a function of all the bits of x, due to Goldreich, Goldwasser, and Micali (ref?).

Reference-contexts: In the following sections, we shall define what it means for a MA protocol to be secure, and then study ways to achieve it, and ways not to achieve it. We will be somewhat less formal than in other sections (no proofs!), since <ref> [BR93] </ref> provides a very lucid exposition of the details. 4.1 How not to achieve secure mutual authentication The simplest MA protocol is for A to send B a challenge, such as an encrypted random number E a (R A ), and then ask B to send back its decryption R A <p> Proof: See <ref> [BR93] </ref>. 5 Asymmetric encryption Asymmetric encryption is also known as public key cryptography. It assumes that each party has a public key, which is known to all, and a private key, which is kept secret (thus introducing asymmetry).

Reference-contexts: We can think of stronger notions of security, such as resistance to chosen ciphertext attack, where the adversary can see the plaintext corresponding to ciphertexts of her choice. Or we might demand that an adversary always know the plaintext for any given ciphertext that she forges (see <ref> [BR94] </ref>). We shall not consider these stronger definitions in these notes. <p> There are fasters schemes, which are not only provably secure in the semantic sense, but also in the known-plaintext sense: see <ref> [BR94] </ref>. However, in practice, public key crytosystems are only used on small texts, such as a key, which is then used for subsequent symmetric encryption. Proposition 187. Proof: By appeal to xenophobic instincts. A Proof of Theorem 5.10 Insert Rafi's notes here. 28

Reference-contexts: We require that P A (S A (M )) = M and S A (P A (M )) = M . We also require that it be hard to compute S A from P A . Diffie and Hellman first introduced this idea in 1976 <ref> [DH76] </ref>, and showed how to use it to achieve asymmetric encryption and asymmetric message authentication ("digital signatures"). Rivest, Shamir and Adleman, in 1978, were the first to demonstrate the construction of functions with the desired properties.

Reference-contexts: What we would like is to prove that the protocol is correct. Modern cryptography, also known as provable security, started with the paper of Goldwasser and Micali <ref> [GM84] </ref>. It involves formally defining the goal, devising a protocol, and proving that the protocol satisfies the goal. Typically it is necessary to make complexity-theoretic assumptions, such as the existence of one way functions (which is equivalent to assuming P 6= N P ). <p> Goldwasser and Micali <ref> [GM84] </ref> first captured the intuition above (in the domain of asymmetric encryption), defining and showing how to achieve semantic security (under a complexity theoretic assumption).

Reference-contexts: we encrypt the result with a one-time pad (i.e., MAC (x) = E a (x 0 )), we have a secure MAC. (Exercise: prove this claim.) However, the resulting MAC has length proportional to n, which is unacceptable. 3.4.4 The WC scheme The general idea, due to Wegman and Carter <ref> [WC80] </ref>, is that we use MAC (x) = E a (h (x)), where h (x) is the hash value of x, which has fixed length.
