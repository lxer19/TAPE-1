Title: A Simple Formalization of Actions Using Circumscription

Abstract: We present a simple circumscriptive method for formalizing actions with indirect effects (ramifications), and show that, in several examples, all second-order quantifiers can be eliminated from these formalizations using existing techniques for computing circumscriptions. One of the two symbolic computation methods employed here is a generalization of predicate completion and the other is based on the SCAN algorithm. The simplicity of our new approach to representing actions is due to the use of the formalism of nested abnormality theories.

Reference-contexts: Example 2. The "murder mystery" from <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> can be formalized by the effect axioms Poss (Load ; s) Loaded (Result (Load ; s)); Poss (Shoot ; s) [Loaded (s) :Alive (Result (Shoot ; s))]; Poss (Shoot ; s) :Loaded (Result (Shoot; s)) and the constraint Walking (s) Alive (s): Example 3. <p> Note that if z includes function constants, SCAN cannot be applied. For instance, since Baker's cir-cumscriptive approach <ref> [ Baker, 1991 ] </ref> involves varying the Result function, it cannot be used directly with SCAN. An implementation of SCAN has been developed by Engel and Ohlbach 2 . Consider the application of this system to computing the circumscriptions from Sec tion 4.

Reference-contexts: Lemma 3. If F (x) does not contain P , then the circumscription CIRC [8x (F (x) P (x)); P ] is equivalent to 8x (F (x) P (x)). Lemma 3 shows that circumscription can be sometimes evaluated by a process similar to the predicate completion algorithm from <ref> [ Clark, 1978 ] </ref> . Let be the conjunction of the universal closures of formulas (v), (vi) and (vii) from the nested abnormality theory T c ab (Section 4).

Reference-contexts: These examples involve actions with indirect effects and, in one case, these effects are nondeterministic. One of the two methods for computing circumscriptions employed here is a generalization of predicate completion [ Lifschitz, 1993 ] and the other is based on the SCAN algorithm <ref> [ Gabbay and Ohlbach, 1992 ] </ref> . The idea behind the approach to the frame problem presented here is closest to that of Winslett [1988]. The main difference is that Winslett's formalization is in terms of theory update, and ours includes the full expressive power of the situation calculus. <p> We see that syntactic methods of computing circumscriptions can be employed to generate the necessary frame axioms. The effect of the circumscriptions in Examples 2 and 3 can be computed in a similar way. 5.2 SCAN SCAN <ref> [ Gabbay and Ohlbach, 1992 ] </ref> is an algorithm for eliminating second-order quantifiers over predicate variables P 1 ; : : : ; P n in formulas of the form 9P 1 : : : P n , where is a first-order formula.

Reference-contexts: Frame axioms of a similar and easy to comprehend form were generated for the other fluents also. In Example 3, SCAN was used to generate the frame axioms in a similar way. 6 Discussion In <ref> [ Giunchiglia et al., 1995 ] </ref> , the method for representing actions from Section 4 is used to define a translation from the high-level action language AR to NATs. <p> The main difference between AR and the language of causal theories, however, is that the former has a semantics, based on the notion of a transition function. The translation from <ref> [ Giunchiglia et al., 1995 ] </ref> is complete relative to this semantics. We have presented evidence that this approach to formalizing actions leads, in some cases, to the circumscriptions that can be evaluated using the predicate completion method or the SCAN algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The idea was to solve the frame problem by postulating that, whenever an action is executed, the "difference" between the two states of the world, before and after the event, is minimal. However, the straightforward formalization based on this idea turned out to be inadequate <ref> [ Hanks and McDermott, 1987 ] </ref> . In this paper, we present a simple formalization of actions using the framework of nested abnormality theories (NATs) [ Lifschitz, 1995 ] , a formalism based on circumscription.

Reference-contexts: However, the straightforward formalization based on this idea turned out to be inadequate [ Hanks and McDermott, 1987 ] . In this paper, we present a simple formalization of actions using the framework of nested abnormality theories (NATs) <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1995 ] </ref> , a formalism based on circumscription. <p> The only effect axiom is Poss (A; s) [F (s) :F (Result (A; s)]: The constraints are F (s) _ G (s) _ H (s); :F (s) _ :H (s); 4 Turning a Causal Theory into an Abnormality Theory In nested abnormality theories, as defined in <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1995 ] </ref> , parts of the axiom set can be grouped into "blocks" of the form fC 1 ; : : : ; C m : 1 ; : : : ; n g; where C 1 ; : : : ; C m are function and/or predicate symbols <p> The new formalization achieves this by "removing" the Result function from the range of circumscription. In this part of the axiom set, we accept the local "theory update" view, as in Winslett's work. According to the semantics of nested abnormality theories <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1995 ] </ref> , the block at the end of the axiom set stands for the axiom formed as follows. Let be the universal closure of the conjunction of all three groups of formulas included in the block.

Example 1. Consider a blocks world domain in which the only actions possible are painting blocks with different colours.

Aspects will serve as arguments of the abnormality predicate Ab. This device, proposed in <ref> [ McCarthy, 1986 ] </ref> , allows us to distinguish between different kinds of abnormality: an object abnormal in one "aspect" can be normal in another. For every fluent symbol F of T , we will need a new function symbol Asp F .

Reference-contexts: We have presented evidence that this approach to formalizing actions leads, in some cases, to the circumscriptions that can be evaluated using the predicate completion method or the SCAN algorithm. One of these examples (Example 3) involves a "ternary state constraint" in the sense of Section 3.1 of <ref> [ Pinto, 1994 ] </ref> and thus is not amenable to the methods developed there for the generation of successor state axioms in the case when all constraints are binary.
