Abstract: We consider two methods for tracing genetic algorithms. The first method is based on the expected values of bit products and the second method on the expected values of Walsh products. We treat proportional selection, mutation and uniform and one-point crossover. As applications, we obtain results on stable points and fitness of schemata.

Reference-contexts: Usually, bit products are more intuitive due to their more direct connection to bit strings, and this makes it easier to understand their properties. Often one is not interested in the distribution itself, but in the population mean (expected value) of a measurement function <ref> (Altenberg 1994) </ref>. With a measurement function one observes certain properties of a distribution. A measurement function takes as input a bit string x and yields a numerical value.

Reference-contexts: The second structure is expected values of Walsh products. Walsh products are similar to the bit products, but the bit strings are changed into f1; 1g-strings, and products are taken on the f1; 1g-strings. In the literature <ref> (e.g., Bethke 1981, Goldberg 1989b, Gold-berg 1989c) </ref>, several applications of Walsh products (but not expected values of Walsh products) can be found in the field of genetic algorithms, for exam ple, for the construction of deceptive fitness functions (functions that are difficult for genetic algorithms), for the construction of a number

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION In this paper we introduce some methods for examining the fundamental properties of genetic algorithms <ref> (Goldberg 1989a, Holland 1992) </ref> that work on populations of bit strings, i.e., strings of a fixed length consisting of zeros and ones. <p> t+1 = (1 p c )E [B 2 i 1 ] t + 1 ) i j=0 i Mutation: E [B 2 i 1 ] t+1 = j=0 i m E [B 2 j 1 ] t : In our graphs we have used a generational Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA) <ref> (Goldberg 1989a) </ref> based on repeating the following sequence after initializing the distribution: select by proportional selection from the distribution an intermediate distribution, then perform crossover on the intermediate distribution with crossover rate p c , and finally perform mutation with mutation rate p m , resulting in the next distribution.

Reference-contexts: We also consider as a special case fitness functions whose values are determined by the number of ones in the string <ref> (Goldberg 1992, Srinivas and Patnaik 1993) </ref>. Consequently, the placement of the ones in the string is irrelevant for the function values, so only symmetric distributions (in which bit strings with an equal number of ones have equal probability) can be applied.

As is the case for distributions <ref> (Vose 1992) </ref>, it is possible with the expected values of bit and Walsh products analytically to find stable distributions, i.e., distributions that do not change under a number of genetic operators.
