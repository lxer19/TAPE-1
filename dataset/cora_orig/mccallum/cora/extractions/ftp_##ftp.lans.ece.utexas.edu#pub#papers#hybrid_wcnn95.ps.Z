Title: A Hybrid Intelligent Architecture for Refining Input Characterization and Domain Knowledge

Abstract: A Hybrid Intelligent Architecture that aims to exploit the complementary features of expert systems and connectionist architecture, is proposed to revise input characterization and initial domain knowledge. HIA has two building blocks, a Rule-Based module and a Connectionist Architecture module. A specific format for the rule-based description of the initial theory acquired from the application domain enables its mapping into a uniform, three layer network. Continuous inputs are discretized into input vectors using a new coarse coding scheme. An extension of the Backpropagation Algorithm allows refinement of the discretization functions. A successful application to the control of dams on the Colorado river near Austin, is described.

Reference-contexts: The overhead due to the introduction of the self-anded nodes and their related links is much less than that incurred by interrupting the training phase and adding, heuristically, a random number of hidden nodes <ref> [2] </ref>. The generated initial connectionist architecture by the NLA has only three layers, independent of the hierarchy of the initial rule-based system and regardless of the nature of the application domain.

Reference-contexts: At the end of the training phase, the final connectionist architecture, with the updated weights and links, can be viewed as a revised domain theory. It can be converted back, if needed, to a rule based format to achieve the power of explanation <ref> [6] </ref>. 2 Representation of Initial Domain Knowledge The first module represents the initial domain knowledge through Domain Operational Rules (DOR). The DOR are built using only the basic domain primitives which can be acquired easily from the domain without consuming much time or effort.
