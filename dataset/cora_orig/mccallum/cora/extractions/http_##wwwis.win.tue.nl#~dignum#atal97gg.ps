Abstract: This paper is about a fundamental aspect of intentional action, namely the process of goal formation. Existing formal theories of agents are found essentially inadequate to account for the formation of new goals and intentions of the agent; on the other hand, the formation of new goals is often viewed as an essential feature of autonomous agents. Autonomous goal-formation is described thanks to the interplay between existing (built-in) goals and new beliefs. A general rule for goal formation is then formally expressed in terms of a language (FORM) developed for treating properties of autonomous agents. More specific applications of this rule to the social domain are examined, in particular to conformity and help.

Reference-contexts: This step of goal generation is a first step towards the forming of intentions. In this paper we have not shown the complete process of intention formation. Some intuitions about the rest of the process can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. We have sketched a formalisation of a goal generation mechanism. Some examples of goal generation (through goal conformation, etc.) were given. Space constraints did not allow many details to be fully examined.

Reference-contexts: An agent may have a goal without being oriented to action, neither positive nor negative. The goal will feed a mental process of goal-dynamics <ref> [4] </ref>, including goal-revision and abandonment, enabling the system to respond to the requirements of the external world by generating goals and checking the conditions and convenience for their achievement. Goals only possibly lead to intentions, and thereby to actions; at the same time, they are necessary for intentions to arise.

Reference-contexts: This remark may look arbitrary to those readers who are familiar with formal agent theories, e.g. BDI architectures [14] in which intentions are defined as a subset of beliefs and desires (see also <ref> [5] </ref>). However, BDI architectures and, more generally, agent theories take for granted the agents choice. Within the logic-based framework, by and large, intentions are a subset of motivations which are chosen for action. Even though Cohen and Levesque [5] and Kinny and Georgeff [12] extensively discuss the abandonment of intentions and <p> intentions are defined as a subset of beliefs and desires (see also <ref> [5] </ref>).

Within the logic-based framework, by and large, intentions are a subset of motivations which are chosen for action. Even though Cohen and Levesque [5] and Kinny and Georgeff [12] extensively discuss the abandonment of intentions and goals they do not indicate what the agent should do when a goal is dropped. <p> There are several reasons for this choice. The most important is that the goals that are generated usually depend on the original goal. When the original goal is dropped, the derived goals are also dropped. This looks like the relative goals as defined in <ref> [5] </ref>. However, there is one major difference. The goals do not disappear but just become unapplicable while the condition upon which they depend is false. This feature makes it possible to drop goals temporarily and resume the achievement later on. This is not possible with the relative goals described in [5]. <p> <ref> [5] </ref>.

We say that an agent x has a candidate goal p in situation q, denoted by C GOAL x (pjq), if p is true in all states that the agent x considers desirable when it believes q is true and p is not true in the current state.

Reference-contexts: We will not go into this selection process in this paper but note its importance for further (practical) research. 3.2 The formal rules We will now describe the goal formation rules in a logic roughly based on <ref> [7] </ref>. The agents that we consider will be held to have beliefs that conform to the KD45 axiomatisation. We denote the fact that agent x believes q by BEL x (q). As in [7], goals are expressed in a conditional form. There are several reasons for this choice. <p> The formal rules We will now describe the goal formation rules in a logic roughly based on <ref> [7] </ref>.

We will not present the complete range of concepts, because they would distract from the formalisation of the concepts used in this paper. On the other hand, we admit that the concepts used in this paper could be formalised in a simpler way.

Reference-contexts: However, it is usually extremely simple through some rule that relates a perceived external condition with a new goal like in [11] or through a received request (or command) like in <ref> [8] </ref>. In other frameworks it is something that is done by the user at the start of the system. The agent only decides which goal is active at a certain moment based on the circumstances (see e.g. [10]).

We do not intend to disqualify this research, but rather advocate an extension of present research to include the matter of goal formation explicitly in the theories.
