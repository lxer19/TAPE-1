Reference-contexts: Awerbuch, Baratz and Peleg <ref> [1] </ref> proposed a heuristic (which we call ABP) that starts from the minimum spanning tree and refines the tree to bound the diameter of the tree. ABP applies to only spanning trees and not Steiner trees. <p> Then, it replaces the paths to the k destinations in the solution by their shortest paths in T spt . There are other variants of this basic approach <ref> [11, 1] </ref>. Extending these algorithm to using two link-metrics requires a mechanism to detect and resolve loops in the multicast tree, because the shortest-delay path may criss-cross the shortest-cost path.

Reference-contexts: Other constrained tree constructions include degree-constrained [4] and delay-variation constrained [41]. Finally, it has been observed that it is expensive in terms of overhead for the construction of multicast tree for each sender <ref> [2] </ref>. In order to conserve network resources, it is better to construct a group-shared tree, which is used to distribute the information from all sources sending to the group. Group-shared trees, however, are not appropriate when the required path metric, such as delay, to destinations has to be minimized. <p> This complicates inter-domain multicasting if the domains involved use different unicast routing. The unicast routing also becomes more complicated by incorporating the multicast-related requirements. To overcome the above shortcomings, two protocols have been recently proposed: the core-based tree (CBT) architecture <ref> [2] </ref> and the protocol independent multicast (PIM) architecture [15]. Although both approaches constitute a substantial improvement over the current multicast architecture, each protocol has its own limitations [36]. <p> Accordingly, we will restrict our presentation to two orthogonal and uncorrelated metrics. Most approaches to multicast routing currently under consideration for the Internet do not consider the multicast tree cost. These approaches include DVMRP [45], MOSPF [34], PIM [15], and CBT <ref> [2] </ref>. These approaches construct shortest-paths, in terms of a single metric, such as delay, from a sender/core to all receivers in the group. 1 While these approaches minimize delay, they do not consider bandwidth sharing to minimize the total cost of the tree.

Reference-contexts: Distributed protocols, DVMRP, PIM, and CBT, minimize only the end-to-end path cost and not the tree cost and use only a single link-metric. Furthermore, for these protocols to provide minimum-cost tree, the link costs must be symmetric. Recently, Banerjea et al. <ref> [3] </ref> have proposed a QoS-sensitive multicast routing protocol. In their protocol, called QoSMIC, a new receiver join the multicast tree by searching for several alternative paths from the tree to itself. The search mechanism involves reverse-path flooding by the receiver.

Reference-contexts: An important example of this is the delay-constrained multicast tree, where the multicast tree must satisfy an upper bound on the cost of the path from the root to the destination [31]. Other constrained tree constructions include degree-constrained <ref> [4] </ref> and delay-variation constrained [41]. Finally, it has been observed that it is expensive in terms of overhead for the construction of multicast tree for each sender [2].

Reference-contexts: One way to have this information is for each node in the network to 10 maintain an updated database of link weights and node connections in the network. This requirement can be supported using one of many topology-broadcast algorithms, which can be based on flooding or other techniques <ref> [6, 25, 23] </ref>. A network is modeled as a directed weighted graph G = (V; E), as shown in Figure 2.1, with node set V and edge set E. The nodes represent routers or switches and edges represent the communication link between them. <p> However, in an internetwork, MIP would have to run on top 46 of an unreliable datagram delivery service such as that provided by Internet Protocol (IP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) <ref> [6] </ref>. Accordingly, MIP provides its own retransmission of queries and replies to ensure that they are exchanged reliably between neighbor routers.

Reference-contexts: The tree cost can be defined as the total cost of the links of the tree that spans the destinations in the multicast group. This definition is pertinent when the objective is to manage network resources efficiently <ref> [7] </ref>. Minimizing the tree cost as defined above is known as the network Steiner tree problem, which is an NP-complete problem [28]. Several heuristics have been proposed to solve the Steiner problem with good performance [43, 32, 40, 47]. <p> The KMB algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree [39] in the complete distance graph, and the Steiner tree of the original network is obtained by achieving the shortest paths represented by edges in the minimum spanning tree. 8 Bharath-Kumar and Jaffe <ref> [7] </ref> discussed minimizing both cost and delay, assuming that cost and delay functions are identical. Awerbuch, Baratz and Peleg [1] proposed a heuristic (which we call ABP) that starts from the minimum spanning tree and refines the tree to bound the diameter of the tree. <p> Finally, Section 4.10 gives concluding remarks and summarizes the advantages of DCMA. 4.2 Previous algorithms Much of the research in constructing multicast trees with QoS constraints has been in producing centralized algorithms. Most of the these approaches have considered only a single link-metric. Kumar et al. <ref> [7] </ref> gave a k trade-off algorithm between optimal network cost and minimum average end-to-end cost. The algorithm builds both the shortest path tree T spt and a heuristic Steiner tree T mst .

Reference-contexts: delay bound set to infinity, which is known to be an NP-complete problem [26] and only heuristics are of practical interest for its solution; BSMA is a new heuristic designed to solve the DBMST problem. 12 2.3 Description of BSMA The DBMST can be approached as a feasible-search optimization problem <ref> [8] </ref> in which the feasible region consists of all trees that satisfy the delay bound requirement. BSMA constructs a DBMST in two phases, as illustrated in Figure 2.2: 1. Initial phase: construct an initial tree with the minimum delays from the source to all destinations. 2.

Reference-contexts: An unsuccessful path-switching, which is called an identity transformation, corresponds to a state transition 23 from a state into one of its replicated states. By construction, IA may perform an identity transformation on a tree for a maximum of n 1 iterations. By Cayley's Theorem <ref> [9] </ref>, there are n n2 possible spanning trees on n nodes. The number of distinct Steiner trees is no greater than the number of spanning trees. The number of Steiner trees is then bounded by n n2 .

Reference-contexts: The forwarding state set up by a multicast algorithm can either be "hard state", requiring explicit removal [37], or it can be "soft state", where periodic refresh messages have to be sent to maintain the state <ref> [10] </ref>. In soft state, the tree state is timed-out if it is not refreshed within a certain interval. The disadvantage of the soft-state method is the periodic bandwidth and processing overhead incurred. Moreover, the timeout value has to be long enough to prevent premature discarding of the forwarding information.

Reference-contexts: ABP applies to only spanning trees and not Steiner trees. This same idea is used in the work by Cong, Kahng, Robins, Sarrafzadeh and Wong <ref> [11] </ref> (which we call CKRSW) except that CKRSW refines the tree to bound the radius of the tree. Both ABP and CKRSW assume identical cost and delay functions. Kompella, Pasquale and Polyzos [31] proposed two heuristics (which we call KPP) that address delay-bounded multicast trees. <p> Then, it replaces the paths to the k destinations in the solution by their shortest paths in T spt . There are other variants of this basic approach <ref> [11, 1] </ref>. Extending these algorithm to using two link-metrics requires a mechanism to detect and resolve loops in the multicast tree, because the shortest-delay path may criss-cross the shortest-cost path.

Reference-contexts: Our simulations were carried out on sparse graphs, that is, the number of edges m is O (n). Using a binary heap for the priority queue gives the complexity of O (n log (n)) for Dijkstra's algorithm in sparse graphs <ref> [12] </ref>. It is also worthwhile noting that the k-shortest path algorithm used in our own implementation of BSMA has time complexity of O (kn 2 log (n)), while k-shortest path algorithms exist of complexity O (kn log (n)); hence, BSMA could run even faster than our own results indicate.

Reference-contexts: The source does not need to know the addresses of the individual members of the group. Any sender can send to a group, whether or not it is a member of the group. The number and location of members in a group can be arbitrary and dynamic. IGMP <ref> [13] </ref> or a similar protocol is assumed for the routers to monitor the presence of group members on their attached subnetworks and to propagate and exchange multicast information. <p> The DCMA routers do not know the group membership or multicast tree topology. In this respect, DCMA is similiar to other multicast routing protocols that are designed for sparse groups. Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) <ref> [13] </ref> or a similar protocol is assumed for the routers to monitor the presence of group members on their attached subnetworks and to propagate and exchange multicast information.

Reference-contexts: Multicasting is supported in local-area networks (LANs) using hardware technologies. Recently, multicasting has been extended to internetworks by Deering <ref> [14] </ref>. Based on Deering's work and built into the TCP/IP protocol suite, the internet group message protocol (IGMP) is used to disseminate multicast membership information to multicast routers. Deering's method permits routers to dynamically determine how to forward messages. A delivery tree is constructed on-demand and is data-driven. <p> Section 3.11 summarizes the results in this chapter. The Appendix gives the pseudo-code for the operations of MIP. 3.2 Overview of MIP 3.2.1 Multicast model Like CBT and PIM, MIP adopts the host group multicast model <ref> [14] </ref>, used in the existing IP architecture. The model defines the service interface to the users of an internetwork.

Reference-contexts: In a shared tree, the packets from a source do not traverse the shortest-path from the source to each destination. Moreover, group-shared trees can suffer from traffic concentration, where the traffic from all sources are concentrated on few links in the network <ref> [15] </ref>, leading to increased congestion on the links. The problem of multicasting real-time traffic necessitates the construction of delay-bounded multicast trees while minimizing the network cost of the tree. We generalize the problem formulation of a delay-bounded minimum-cost multicast problem to allow real-valued delays and delay-bounds. <p> This complicates inter-domain multicasting if the domains involved use different unicast routing. The unicast routing also becomes more complicated by incorporating the multicast-related requirements. To overcome the above shortcomings, two protocols have been recently proposed: the core-based tree (CBT) architecture [2] and the protocol independent multicast (PIM) architecture <ref> [15] </ref>. Although both approaches constitute a substantial improvement over the current multicast architecture, each protocol has its own limitations [36]. A major limitation of CBT is that it constructs only a single tree per group and thus provides longer end-to-end delays than would be obtained along a shortest-path tree. <p> Accordingly, we will restrict our presentation to two orthogonal and uncorrelated metrics. Most approaches to multicast routing currently under consideration for the Internet do not consider the multicast tree cost. These approaches include DVMRP [45], MOSPF [34], PIM <ref> [15] </ref>, and CBT [2]. These approaches construct shortest-paths, in terms of a single metric, such as delay, from a sender/core to all receivers in the group. 1 While these approaches minimize delay, they do not consider bandwidth sharing to minimize the total cost of the tree.

Reference-contexts: This definition of cost is important for delay-sensitive, real-time and interactive applications. The minimization of this tree cost is modeled as the shortest-path problem, which can by solved in polynomial time <ref> [16, 21] </ref>. In addition to minimizing the cost of the multicast tree to be constructed, another important consideration is constraining some properties of the tree. Constraints on the multicast tree are commonly intended to guarantee specified performance metrics about the tree. <p> Optimization techniques for multicasting proposed previously have considered the delay and cost optimization objectives, but have treated them as distinct problems. Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm <ref> [16] </ref> can be used to generate the shortest paths from the source to destinations and provides the optimal solution for delay minimization. Multicast algorithms that perform cost optimization have been based on computing the minimum Steiner tree in a graph. <p> Improvement phase: iteratively minimize the cost of the tree while always satisfying the delay bounds. To guarantee that a feasible solution is found that satisfies the given delay bound, the initial tree is the minimum-delay tree, which is constructed using Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm <ref> [16] </ref>. In some cases, the delay bounds given by DDF may be too tight, i.e., they cannot be met even in the minimum-delay tree.

Reference-contexts: PIM is based on the notion of soft state, which requires routers in a multicast tree to refresh their membership in the tree periodically (e.g., every 60 seconds, the suggested default value [20]). In contrast, MIP is based on diffusing computations <ref> [17, 24] </ref>, which means that every computation started by a router to create and maintain a multicast tree is propagated to other routers as needed using a recursive query-response mechanism. <p> Proof: For a given group, MIP terminates when no router sends queries or replies for the group. Consider a stable topology and correct routing tables first. The expand, terminate and root-update computations terminate by the termination of a diffusing computation <ref> [17] </ref>, using the query and reply counters. The join computation terminates similarly: each reply decreases the number of receiver in the join-compute sets of routers in the network, and this number is bounded from below by zero.

Reference-contexts: This could discover changes in the network in that receiver finding new shorter delays to the root could initiate a re-joining. 9 In this special case with the cost and delay metric being the same, DCMA's initial tree construction reduces to the SPATH Steiner heuristic <ref> [18] </ref>. 102 cost performance.

Reference-contexts: The popularity and availability of these multicast applications has lead to a phenomenal growth of the multicast backbone or MBone <ref> [19] </ref>. Multimedia applications are bandwidth intensive and real-time in nature; thus, they impose a greater load on the internetwork. In multipoint applications, users often need to send the same information to several, but not necessarily all, other users.

Reference-contexts: PIM is based on the notion of soft state, which requires routers in a multicast tree to refresh their membership in the tree periodically (e.g., every 60 seconds, the suggested default value <ref> [20] </ref>). In contrast, MIP is based on diffusing computations [17, 24], which means that every computation started by a router to create and maintain a multicast tree is propagated to other routers as needed using a recursive query-response mechanism. <p> A shared tree is constructed with router 24 being the root and RP of MIP and PIM, respectively. For PIM, the timers are set to 60 seconds, which is the suggested default value for the Join/Prune refresh interval in PIM's specification <ref> [20] </ref>. For MIP, the receiver-initiated tree creation mode is used. The link delays are assumed to be the same in both directions. <p> This can be handled by a root-discovery mechanism/protocol. For example, PIM specifies a "bootstrap" mechanism that is applicable to intra-domain core-discovery. Routers that are available or configured to serve as root express their availability periodically (e.g., every 60 seconds) to the (domain's) bootstrap router (BSR) in "root advertisement" messages <ref> [20] </ref>. The BSR, which is elected 100 from a set, gathers the advertisements and then periodically distributes the availability of roots as a root-set to all routers (in the domain).

Reference-contexts: A straightforward implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm has O (n 2 ) complexity. Thus, s (n) = O (n 2 ). Using more sophisticated data structures s (n) can be reduced to O (m + n log n), where m is the number of edges in the network <ref> [22] </ref>. This complexity is better for sparse graphs. By Lemma 2.2, the expected number of path-switchings to be performed is O (n log (n)).

Since DCMA performs periodic rearrangements, it is expected to have a good "damage" in a Steiner multicast tree due to the changes in the group membership [5] with good performance.

Another way to define the tree cost is as the sum of the cost 4 of the path from a designated host, called the source, to the destinations in the multicast group.

Reference-contexts: In our description and implementation of BSMA, we have used a k-shortest-path algorithm to perform path-switching. The complexity of k-shortest path algorithm 2 is O (ks (n)), where s (n) is the complexity of single-source shortest-path algorithm <ref> [29] </ref>. However, k can be exceedingly large. For example, consider a grid graph, where all edges have a unit cost, and some delay. The number of paths between two nodes grows exponentially with the Manhattan distance between the nodes, all of which have the same cost.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is not possible to guarantee the correctness and loop-freedom of QoSMIC. 80 Only a few distributed algorithms have been proposed to construct QoS-constrained, minimum-cost multicast trees. Kompella et al. presented a distributed algorithm <ref> [30] </ref> for this problem. The algorithm is based on the distributed minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm. They assume each node knows the minimum delay to all other nodes in the network, in order to know if the tree is being constructed in a manner that satisfies the delay bounds.

Reference-contexts: Constraints on the multicast tree are commonly intended to guarantee specified performance metrics about the tree. An important example of this is the delay-constrained multicast tree, where the multicast tree must satisfy an upper bound on the cost of the path from the root to the destination <ref> [31] </ref>. Other constrained tree constructions include degree-constrained [4] and delay-variation constrained [41]. Finally, it has been observed that it is expensive in terms of overhead for the construction of multicast tree for each sender [2]. <p> This same idea is used in the work by Cong, Kahng, Robins, Sarrafzadeh and Wong [11] (which we call CKRSW) except that CKRSW refines the tree to bound the radius of the tree. Both ABP and CKRSW assume identical cost and delay functions. Kompella, Pasquale and Polyzos <ref> [31] </ref> proposed two heuristics (which we call KPP) that address delay-bounded multicast trees. In their formulation, the delay bound for all destinations is the same; furthermore, KPP assumes that link delays and the delay bound are integer-valued and that link costs and delays are symmetric. <p> KPP extends the KMB algorithm by taking into account the constraint of the specified delay bound in the construction of the complete distance graph <ref> [31] </ref>. This chapter presents a new algorithm for the construction of a minimum-cost multicast tree with delay constraints. The algorithm, which we call Bounded Shortest Multicast Algorithm (BSMA) 1 proceeds in two phases. It starts by obtaining a minimum delay tree using any of the well known shortest path algorithms. <p> If these algorithms are to consider delay-bounds and the delay 79 bounds are tight, the algorithms have to use the the shortest-path tree without being able to take advantage of the computed T mst and without any improvements in cost. Kompella et al. <ref> [31] </ref> considered the problem of minimum-cost routing subject to a maximum integer delay constraint using two link metrics. They assumed undirected links, independent costs and integer delays on links, and modified KMB heuristic to compute a solution satisfying the delay bound.

Reference-contexts: This definition is pertinent when the objective is to manage network resources efficiently [7]. Minimizing the tree cost as defined above is known as the network Steiner tree problem, which is an NP-complete problem [28]. Several heuristics have been proposed to solve the Steiner problem with good performance <ref> [43, 32, 40, 47] </ref>. Another way to define the tree cost is as the sum of the cost 4 of the path from a designated host, called the source, to the destinations in the multicast group. This definition of cost is important for delay-sensitive, real-time and interactive applications. <p> A Steiner tree in a graph must reach a subset of nodes in the graph, called given nodes. The problem of finding the minimum Steiner tree is known to be an NP-complete problem [26], and a number of heuristics <ref> [32, 40, 43] </ref> have been developed to solve this problem in polynomial time and producing near-optimum results.

In practice, the average sub-optimality of KMB is far below this limit and is near optimal.

Reference-contexts: The search for the delay-bounded shortest p s path used to reconnect the two trees T 1 j j starts with the shortest path between the two trees. If, however, the shortest path results in a violation of delay bounds, BSMA uses an incremental k-shortest path algorithm <ref> [33, 48] </ref> to find a delay-bounded shortest path to reconnect the two trees. The k-shortest path problem consists of finding the kth shortest simple path connecting a given source-destination pair in a graph. Note that, in BSMA, the k-shortest path is between two trees. <p> In the following theorems and corollaries, we let k be the average number of shortest paths evaluated to get the delay-bounded shortest path. 2 Our implementation of the k-shortest path uses the algorithm described by Lawler <ref> [33] </ref> which takes O (kn 3 ). 3 One way to limit k is to examine the shortest-paths from the nodes of one subtree (T 1 j ) to the nodes of the other (T 2 j ).

Reference-contexts: A delivery tree is constructed on-demand and is data-driven. The tree in the existing IP architecture is the reverse shortest-path tree and shortest-path tree from the source to the group for distance-vector (i.e., DVMRP [45]) and link-state routing (i.e., MOSPF <ref> [34] </ref>), respectively. For example, the Multicast Backbone (MBone) in today's Internet consists of a set of routers running DVMRP. However, there are several shortcomings with the existing IP multicast architecture, i.e., DVMRP and MOSPF. <p> Accordingly, we will restrict our presentation to two orthogonal and uncorrelated metrics. Most approaches to multicast routing currently under consideration for the Internet do not consider the multicast tree cost. These approaches include DVMRP [45], MOSPF <ref> [34] </ref>, PIM [15], and CBT [2]. These approaches construct shortest-paths, in terms of a single metric, such as delay, from a sender/core to all receivers in the group. 1 While these approaches minimize delay, they do not consider bandwidth sharing to minimize the total cost of the tree. <p> The link-state routing can provide direction-sensitive routing to use when network links have asymmetric link parameters. Thus, for simplicity of exposition, we assume link-state underlying unicast routing, even though DCMA can operate using a direction-sensitive distance-vector routing. When using link-state information, DCMA differs from MOSPF <ref> [34] </ref> in that it does not require global group membership information, and is thus more scalable. MOSPF assumes 83 the knowledge of the network topology and group membership. Therefore, membership link-state advertisements (LSAs) are periodically flooded in the entire network.

Reference-contexts: We anticipate that CST heuristics will be applied to large-scale networks within the context of hierarchical routing, because the underlying routing mechanisms used to disseminate topology data require the aggregation of information in order to cope with network size (e.g., OSPF <ref> [35] </ref>). In addition to reducing the number of nodes and links that a node running BSMA needs to know, BSMA's running time can be made faster by limiting the number of k shortest paths used in BSMA's iterations, at the expense of larger tree costs.

Reference-contexts: Our work was the first to identify and show the looping problems in the two main proposed multicast protocols for use in the Internet, i.e., PIM and CBT <ref> [36] </ref>. We present and verify a new multicast routing protocol, called Multicast Internet Protocol (MIP), which offers a simple and flexible approach to constructing both group-shared and shortest-paths multicast trees. <p> To overcome the above shortcomings, two protocols have been recently proposed: the core-based tree (CBT) architecture [2] and the protocol independent multicast (PIM) architecture [15]. Although both approaches constitute a substantial improvement over the current multicast architecture, each protocol has its own limitations <ref> [36] </ref>. A major limitation of CBT is that it constructs only a single tree per group and thus provides longer end-to-end delays than would be obtained along a shortest-path tree. <p> An important limitation of PIM is that its periodic control messages, i.e., its soft-state mechanism, incur overhead even in a stable internet. Both protocols have been shown to suffer from temporary loops resulting from the use of inconsistent unicast routing information <ref> [36] </ref>, and neither protocol has been verified to provide correct multicast routing trees after network changes. We present and verify a new multicast routing protocol called Multicast Internet Protocol (MIP), which solves the shortcomings of the previous approaches to multicast routing.

Reference-contexts: These tables maintain pointers to neighbors to which multicast packets are forwarded in order to reach their destinations. The forwarding state set up by a multicast algorithm can either be "hard state", requiring explicit removal <ref> [37] </ref>, or it can be "soft state", where periodic refresh messages have to be sent to maintain the state [10]. In soft state, the tree state is timed-out if it is not refreshed within a certain interval.

Reference-contexts: Kompella et al. [31] considered the problem of minimum-cost routing subject to a maximum integer delay constraint using two link metrics. They assumed undirected links, independent costs and integer delays on links, and modified KMB heuristic to compute a solution satisfying the delay bound.

Evaluation studies by Salama et al. [42] shows the superiority of the BSMA to all other proposed heuristics for the minimum-cost delay-constrained problem. <p> During each rearrangement computation, called an election, a path in the tree with the highest cost is elected to be replaced with an alternative path that minimizes the cost of the tree and satisfies the delay constraints. This approach is inspired by the way in which BSMA <ref> [38] </ref> operates. A major advantage of the election computation is the dynamic discovery of paths in the tree with high costs as group members join and leave a multicast tree and the network link cost changes.

Reference-contexts: In Kou, Markowsky and Berman's (KMB) algorithm [32], a network is abstracted to a complete distance graph consisting of edges that represent the shortest paths between the source node and each destination node. The KMB algorithm constructs a minimum spanning tree <ref> [39] </ref> in the complete distance graph, and the Steiner tree of the original network is obtained by achieving the shortest paths represented by edges in the minimum spanning tree. 8 Bharath-Kumar and Jaffe [7] discussed minimizing both cost and delay, assuming that cost and delay functions are identical. <p> In this case, the Steiner tree problem reduces to the minimum-weight spanning tree for the unconstrained case. Finding the minimum-weight spanning tree can be solved optimally in O (n 2 ) using Prim's algorithm <ref> [39] </ref>. The results are shown in Figure 2.8, which uses the same labeling introduced for Fig. 2.7. The cost ratio is normalized with respect to the minimum spanning tree (instead of the KMB tree). The error bars again represent 95% confidence interval.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we conjecture from our experiments that the quality of a solution found by BSMA is near-optimal in practice. We expect BSMA to obtain smaller costs than those of KPP, because KPP is based on the KMB algorithm. Recent simulation results obtained by Salama et al. <ref> [42] </ref> confirm that the cost of BSMA is consistently lower than the cost of KPP; their results also show that BSMA is better than KPP and all the other algorithms reported to date for delay-constrained multicasting.

Moreover, our experiments and the simulation results by Salama et al. [42] confirm that BSMA always succeeded in constructing a tree if there is a feasible solution, whereas KPP can fail if the granularity used to scale costs to integer values is not of proper size. <p> The running times of BSMA are much lower than the ones reported by Salama et al. <ref> [42] </ref>. Our simulation results for 30 members in a 100-node graph for the most stringent delay-bound are on the average about 4 times longer than KMB. <p> The average number of k is 23. The execution time of BSMA is nevertheless on the same order of magnitude as KMB. We conjecture that the differences between our results on BSMA execution times and those reported by Salama et al. <ref> [42] </ref> are due to differences in the specific k-shortest path algorithm used to implement BSMA and the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. Our implementation of the k-shortest path also uses Dijkstra's algorithm implemented using a binary heap data structure. <p> The cost minimization is monotonically achieved after a series of delay bounded path-switching improvements. The simulation results show that BSMA can produce delay-bounded multicast trees that have low cost. Recent results by Salama et al. <ref> [42] </ref> confirm our results and show that BSMA is the best algorithm in terms of cost and number of sessions established for computation of delay-constrained minimum-cost multicast trees among all the constrained Steiner tree (CST) algorithms reported to date. <p> Parsa et al.

Distributed protocols, DVMRP, PIM, and CBT, minimize only the end-to-end path cost and not the tree cost and use only a single link-metric.
