Abstract: Protein fold recognition (threading) involves the prediction of a protein's three-dimensional shape based on its similarity to a protein whose structure is known. Fold predictions are low resolution; no effort is made to rotate the protein's component amino acid side chains into their correct spatial orientations. Rather, the goal is to recognize the protein family member that most closely resembles the target sequence of unknown structure and to create a sensible alignment of the target to the structure (i.e., a structure-sequence alignment). To complement this structure prediction method we have implemented a low resolution molecular graphics tool. Since amino acid side chain orientation is not relevant in fold recognition, amino acid residues are represented by abstract shapes or glyphs much like Lego (tm) blocks. We also borrow techniques from comparative streamline visualization to provide clean depictions of the entire protein structure model. By creating a low resolution representation of protein structure, we are able to approximately double the amount of information on the screen. This implementation also possesses the advantage of eliminating distracting and possibly misleading visual clutter resulting from the mapping of protein alignment information onto a high resolution display of a known structure.

Reference-contexts: One example of such a tool is ANALYST, [19] which was developed to visualize the output of the THREADER [15] program.

Chime is based on RasMol, and is therefore limited to displaying an existing structure and using display options such as color to indicate alignment quality.

Reference-contexts: The chemical and physical properties of the amino acids which comprise a protein determine how the protein will fold upon itself. 2.2 Protein Structure Prediction In the late 1950's, Christian Anfinsen <ref> [3] </ref> discovered that after the protein ribonuclease was unfolded (denatured) by chemical means, the denaturants could be removed, allowing the protein to refold and slowly regain its original catalytic ability.

Typically, a higher degree of similarity between the protein sequences in the alignment is needed in order to carry out homology modeling. <p> In addition to using amino acid similarity measures, when building a structural model of a protein it is important to analyze the validity of the alignment in the context of the structure's three-dimensional environment. There are several important guidelines used to evaluate such a model. Bajorath et al. <ref> [5] </ref> provides an excellent review of typical assessment methods. 1. The protein's inner core tends to be more evolutionarily conserved than the outer loops. Since the core regions are responsible for the general structure, the protein's stability is more sensitive to mutations in this area.

Reference-contexts: Another important criterion is packing, i.e., the density of amino acids in the protein. Differences in the volumes of target versus structure amino acids can lead to over- or under packing. <ref> [10] </ref> 5. Each amino acid has preferences both for which other amino acids it is more likely to contact, and for which environments are more likely to be found surrounding it. Preference profiles are useful in judging whether an alignment makes sense structurally. [11] 6.

For example, if a protein contains a tight hairpin turn, it may be the case that only a very small amino acid such as glycine will fit there.

We use the BLOSUM 62 <ref> [14] </ref> amino acid substitution matrix as an indicator of alignment quality independent of structural information. Rather than taking into consideration an individual residue's environment in relation to the structure of the entire protein, this matrix contains a measure of the likelihood of finding a particular amino acid substitution in nature.

Reference-contexts: If a match is found, the two sequences can be aligned such that similar amino acids are placed in the same columns (see figure 4). Once the alignment between the target and the structure has been created, the target can be threaded through the structure. <ref> [16] </ref> This involves the creation of a structural model in which the aligned portions of the target sequence backbone are placed in the same orientations as the corresponding backbone segments of the known structure. In this way, the overall shape of the protein is predicted.

Reference-contexts: By focusing on the major structural aspects of amino acids, we are able to display approximately twice as much information as is commonly shown in high resolution protein depictions, while making the overall representation cleaner (compare figures 1 and 2). We have borrowed techniques used in UFLOW <ref> [18] </ref> comparative streamline visualization to remedy the second problem. The target and structure proteins are represented as individual streamlines. Correspondences between residues in the target and the structure are indicated by line segments connecting the streamlines, much like rungs on a ladder (see figure 8).

Reference-contexts: The patterns in the local residue conformations of a protein are known as secondary structure. A protein's secondary structure can be predicted using only its sequence of amino acids. Due to the relatively high accuracy of secondary structure predictions, (approximately 65-72% <ref> [20] </ref>), they are useful as another test in determining the quality of a structural model: If the predicted secondary structure regions for the target sequence alone match the actual secondary structure regions of the sequence with known structure, this will lend credence both to the alignment between the two, as well

Reference-contexts: An example of such a program is RasMol <ref> [22] </ref> (see figures 1 and 7). RasMol allows you to display a molecule in many different modes (backbone, wireframe, ball and stick, etc.). However, RasMol is strictly for molecular visualization, and will therefore neither read nor analyze alignment files. <p> The similarity between the two residues according to the BLOSUM 62 2 Pictures A and B were created using RasMol. <ref> [22] </ref> matrix is mapped to the color of the two blocks. In this case red indicates a poor match (in fact, the actual score is 2). Phenylala-nine's hydrophobic nature is indicated by its square shape; similarly, the fact that histidine is a polar molecule is represented by its cylindrical structure.
