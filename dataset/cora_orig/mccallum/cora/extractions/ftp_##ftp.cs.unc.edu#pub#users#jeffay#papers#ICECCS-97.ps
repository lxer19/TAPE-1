Abstract: The Processing Graph Method (PGM) | a dataflow model widely used in the design and analysis of embedded signal-processing applications | is studied from a real-time scheduling perspective. It is shown that the problem of deciding if instances of the general model are feasible on a single processor is intractable (co-NP-complete in the strong sense); however, a useful special case is sometimes more tractable. An efficient feasibility test and an optimal preemptive scheduling algorithm are derived for this special case, and a procedure is presented which permits system architects to make efficient use of computational resources and memory requirements for buffers while constructing real-time dataflow applications that offer hard service guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Even the U.S. Navy's own dataflow methodology, Processing Graph Method (PGM) <ref> [1] </ref>, lacks real-time analysis techniques to support making cost tradeoffs or to verify schedulability requirements. PGM is a U.S. Navy standard for developing real-time, embedded, antisubmarine warfare (ASW) applications for the AN/UYS-2A (the U.S. Navy's standard signal processor). The AN/UYS-2A is used in a number of U.S. <p> We conclude in Section 6 with a summary of the major ideas presented herein. 2. PGM dataflow graphs This section provides a formal description of the specification of a PGM dataflow graph we require to perform our analysis. See <ref> [1] </ref> for the actual PGM specification.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Signal processing algorithms are often defined in the literature using large grain dataflow graphs <ref> [4] </ref>: directed graphs in which a node is a sequential program that executes from start to finish in isolation (i.e., without synchronization), and the graph edges depict the flow of data from one node to the next. Thus, an edge represents a producer/consumer relationship between two nodes.

Reference-contexts: The only essential properties of the SAR graph are those that influence node execution (i.e., the produce, consume, and threshold values for each node). For a more detailed description of the processing performed by the SAR benchmark, see <ref> [6] </ref>. The top row of nodes in the SAR graph each operate on one pulse of data at a time. The pulse delivered by the external source, labeledYRange, has already been converted to complex-valued data and consists of 118 range gate samples.
