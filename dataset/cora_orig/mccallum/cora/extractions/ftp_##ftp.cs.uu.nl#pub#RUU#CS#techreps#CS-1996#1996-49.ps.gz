Title: Geometric Eccentricity and the Complexity of Manipulation Plans  
Author: A. Frank van der Stappen Ken Goldberg Mark H. Overmars 
Abstract: Complexity bounds for algorithms for robotic motion and manipulation can be misleading when they are constructed with pathological `worst-case' scenarios that rarely appear in practice. Complexity can in some cases be reduced by characterizing non-pathological objects in terms of intuitive geometric properties. In this paper we consider the number of push and push-squeeze actions needed to orient a part without sensors and improve on the upper bound of O(n) for polygonal parts given by Chen and Ierardi in [9]. We define the geometric eccentricity of a planar part based on the aspect ratio of a distinguished bounding box. We show that only O(1) actions are required for parts with non-zero eccentricity. The analysis also applies to curved parts, providing the first complexity bound for non-polygonal parts. Our results also yield new bounds on part feeders that use fences and conveyor belts.

Goldberg [11] considered the problem of orienting (feeding) polygonal parts using a parallel-jaw gripper. <p> Goldberg showed that N is O (n 2 ) for polygonal parts with n vertices, and gave an algorithm for finding the shortest squeeze plan. Based on a large number of pseudo-random trials, he conjectured that N is O (n). Chen and Ierardi <ref> [9] </ref> proved Goldberg's conjecture using a different planning algorithm. They showed that plans generated by their algorithm, which does not necessarily find the shortest plan, require at most 2n 1 actions, thereby proving the O (n) bound on the length of the shortest plan. <p> Observe that our notion of geometric eccentricity for parts is quite similar to the notion of eccentricity for ellipses. 3 Grasp actions and equilibrium grasps Chen and Ierardi <ref> [9] </ref> present simple (push and squeeze) plans for orienting polygonal parts. Although their plans are generally not the shortest possible plans, an upper bound on the length of their plans clearly bounds the (optimum) length of plans found by Goldberg's algorithm. <p> Proof: By the proof of Lemma 2, we only have to consider how to shrink an interval [b; a] with jr (a)j = ff and jr (b)j = ff. Chen and Ierardi show (Lemma 2.5 <ref> [9] </ref>) that a single application of the gripper suffices to reduce the interval [b + ffi; a] (ffi &gt; ).

Goldberg <ref> [11] </ref> considered the problem of orienting (feeding) polygonal parts using a parallel-jaw gripper. A parallel-jaw gripper consists of a pair of flat parallel jaws that can close in the direction orthogonal to the jaws, allowing it to squeeze the part. Figure 1 shows a (frictionless) parallel-jaw gripper. <p> Figure 3 shows an example of a radius function and the corresponding push function. The construction of the steps and ramps of the squeeze function 0 2 2 l (v) r (v) v r () from the diameter function is accomplished in a similar manner (see <ref> [11, 17] </ref> for details). Equilibrium orientations play a crucial role in this paper. More specifically, we use a property of the point of contact of the part P with a jaw pushing P in an equilibrium push direction. Let us consider a jaw pushing P in a certain direction .

As a result, the corresponding contact or normal direction is an equilibrium push direction (see Figure 4 (b,c)). We use the aspect ratio of the minimum width bounding box as a measure for the eccentricity of the part.
