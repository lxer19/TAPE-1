Abstract: In addition to learning new knowledge, a system must be able to learn when the knowledge is likely to be applicable. An index is a piece of information which, when identified in a given situation, triggers the relevant piece of knowledge (or schema) in the system's memory. We discuss the issue of how indices may be learned automatically in the context of a story understanding task, and present a program that can learn new indices for existing explanatory schemas. We discuss two methods using which the system can identify the relevant schema even if the input does not directly match an existing index, and learn a new index to allow it to retrieve this schema more efficiently in the future.

Reference-contexts: Even without a "driving rashly" index, the system can infer that Jack might get into an accident, and thus be able to retrieve the XP-VEHICLE-ACCIDENT. This inference requires general knowledge about the words in the story (similar to <ref> (Charniak 1978) </ref>), and about the concepts in this domain (such as DRIVE typically involves a driver, a vehicle as an instrument, etc.) Here, the system might infer that whenever someone is driving rashly, there is a strong possibility that an accident might occur.

Reference-contexts: Early story understanding systems that use schemas include SAM (Cullingford 1978), FRUMP <ref> (DeJong 1979) </ref> and IPP (Lebowitz 1980). All these systems assume that the first or an early sentence in a story is the main source of indices for retrieving relevant schema or other knowledge structures.

What should the system use as an index to the new schema or XP? A simple approach would be to record the information in the first sentence of the story as an index to the new XP.

Reference-contexts: S 2 does not trigger the XP, either. But S 3 contains an index to the XP-VEHICLE-ACCIDENT ("hitting a car" can be a situational index <ref> (Ram 1989) </ref> to this XP), and it triggers this schema. XP-VEHICLE-ACCIDENT suggests that the precondition for an accident is "driving" by which the first deferred sentence (S 1 in this story) is connected. S 2 further qualifies "driving," the action in S 1 . <p> We are also developing representations for additional explanation patterns in order to evaluate the generality of the learning algorithm. 3 Since our implementation focuses on learning issues, we have avoided issues related to parsing by hand-translating the stories into a conceptual representation similar to that of AQUA <ref> (Ram 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In order to decide when to perform this inference, a simple heuristic, corresponding to the simple heuristic for deferred schema selection, would be to do the inference only if the first sentence does not directly trigger any schema. The inference can be as simple as "chaining" (as in <ref> (Rieger 1975) </ref>). This process uses causal rules to construct inferences by constructing chains of inferences based on these rules. Although this method helps the system retrieve XPs and thus come to a better understanding of the story, this improvement comes at the expense of possible combinatorial explosion of inferences. <p> The first implementation is built on top of the McSAM program (Schank and Riesbeck 1981), which uses scripts (Cullingford 1978; Schank and Abelson 1977) and causal rules <ref> (Rieger 1975) </ref> to understand natural language stories.

Reference-contexts: These issues are beyond the scope of this paper. 5 Implementation We are developing two implementations of our learning methods using different schema-based understanding programs as the base. The first implementation is built on top of the McSAM program <ref> (Schank and Riesbeck 1981) </ref>, which uses scripts (Cullingford 1978; Schank and Abelson 1977) and causal rules (Rieger 1975) to understand natural language stories.
