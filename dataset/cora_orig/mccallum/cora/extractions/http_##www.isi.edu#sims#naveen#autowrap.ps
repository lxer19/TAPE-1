Abstract: To simplify the task of obtaining information from the vast number of information sources that are available on the World Wide Web (WWW), we are building tools to build information mediators for extracting and integrating data from multiple Web sources. In a mediator based approach, wrappers are built around individual information sources, that provide translation between the mediator query language and the individual source. We present an approach for semi-automatically generating wrappers for structured internet sources. The key idea is to exploit formatting information in Web pages from the source to hypothesize the underlying structure of a page. From this structure the system generates a wrapper that facilitates querying of a source and possibly integrating it with other sources. We demonstrate the ease with which we are able to build wrappers for a number of Web sources using our implemented wrapper generation toolkit.

Reference-contexts: Capability to retrieve data over the network. Currently we are using PERL scripts for the purpose of making HTTP connections to the Web information sources and retrieving data from them. 3. Communication between the mediator and wrapper. We are using the agent communication language KQML <ref> [7] </ref> for the purpose of providing interprocess communication between the mediator and a wrapper. Adding the above functionality is the final step in generating a wrapper for a new source.

A template based approach is used where a user provides actions that execute when a query matches a certain template or format.

Wrapper generation for Web sources is also discussed in <ref> [12] </ref>. The focus of their work is very similar to ours i.e., building wrappers for Web sources to be integrated by a software agent.

Reference-contexts: They may also be written entirely in upper case words, or may end with a colon. We can generate a lexical analyzer that searches a page for such tokens using LEX <ref> [13] </ref>, a lexical analyzer generator. In Table 1 we list the regular expressions given as specifications to LEX to identify tokens indicating headings on a page. From these specifications we generate a lexical analyzer that identifies words or phrases conforming to the regular expressions.

Reference-contexts: We are working an adding capabilities to the system to quickly learn the structure of a new kind of heading from a few user examples. We are applying techniques from inducing Hidden Markov models (HMMs), describing the tokens, from corpora of positive examples. The basic idea, described in <ref> [16] </ref> is to start with an HMM accepting only the initial tokens marked by the user. Then, states in the HMM are merged to yield a generalized model that can be used to identify the remaining tokens in the page.
