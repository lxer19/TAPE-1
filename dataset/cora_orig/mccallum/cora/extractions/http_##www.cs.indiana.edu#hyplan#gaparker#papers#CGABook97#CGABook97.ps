Title: CYCLIC GENETIC ALGORITHMS FOR ROBOTIC CONTROL

Abstract: There are several problems relating to robotic control that require solutions consisting of a sequence of instructions that are continually repeated. One of the more well known of these problems is that of gait production for hexapod robots. A satisfactory gait requires the proper sequence of commands given to the various actuators of the robot in such an order that not only are the individual legs coordinated but the set of legs are coordinated. This sequence needs to be properly structured so that it can be continually repeated to produce sustained forward motion. In this paper we describe Cyclic Genetic Algorithms which were developed to solve these cyclic sequence problems by using the principles of evolutionary computation. The CGA is applied to the specific problem of gait generation for an actual hexapod robot. Trained on a model of the robot, it produced the sequence of activations required for cycles in an optimal tripod gait.

Reference-contexts: Gait generation for hexapod robots, which is one example of robotic control, has been addressed with several approaches. Marc Donner <ref> (Donner,1986) </ref> developed control strategies for the SSA six legged robot using decomposition of the task's elements and locality of control. He also developed a programming language, OWL, to provide real-time performance. Rodney Brooks (Brooks,1989) used subsumption architecture in the development of his robots.

Reference-contexts: He also developed a programming language, OWL, to provide real-time performance. Rodney Brooks (Brooks,1989) used subsumption architecture in the development of his robots. Randall Beer and John Gallagher used a neural net to control a simulated cockroach (Beer,1992) and an actual hexapod robot <ref> (Gallagher,1994) </ref>. These solutions proved to be successful for the robots used but we wanted a solution that could work on the most primitive of robots and required less a priori knowledge of how to walk. <p> These solutions proved to be successful for the robots used but we wanted a solution that could work on the most primitive of robots and required less a priori knowledge of how to walk. Graham Spencer <ref> (Spencer,1994) </ref> concentrated on one of these goals by using genetic programming to develop gaits for a simulated robot using minimal knowledge about the intricacies of walking. <p> The robot used in the formation of our model was the Stiquito II (figure 2); developed by Jonathan Mills <ref> (Mills, 1994) </ref> as an alternative to the larger, more complex and expensive norm in six legged robots. This small, inexpensive hexapod was selected due to its potential for expanded research and its elementary locomotion; which makes it a perfect platform for learning to walk using low-level primitives.
