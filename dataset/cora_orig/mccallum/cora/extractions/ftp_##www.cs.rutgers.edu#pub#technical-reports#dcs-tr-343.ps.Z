Reference-contexts: This environment, where one can have access to any information one wants in (m)any forms is called an infocosm [44] (a twist on George Gilder's "telecosm" <ref> [1] </ref>). Infocosm thus represents a society with ubiquitous access/exchange of tradeable information in all digital forms of representation. Another simple and intuitive definition of infocosm appears in [21] where it is defined as an environment where users can participate in information based activities without constraints of space, time and location.

Reference-contexts: Besides, the InfoSleuth architecture also lacks the presence of a component analogous to the inter-vocabulary relationships manager in the abstract metadata-based architecture. Hence the InfoSleuth system in its present version lacks in adaptability especially across 183 different information domains. 9.2 The SIMS project The overall goal of the SIMS <ref> [3] </ref> project at ISI is to provide intelligent access to heterogeneous, distributed information sources (databases, knowledge bases, flat files, programs, etc.), while insulating human users and application programs from the need to be aware of the location of the sources, their query languages, organization, size, etc.

Reference-contexts: A summary of all the ontologies and the underlying repositories is given in Table 7.1. Description Logics Systems Systems based on Description Logics, also known as terminological systems, are descendants of KL-ONE [13]. Some systems based on Description Logics are CLASSIC [11], BACK [92], LOOM [57] and KRIS <ref> [4] </ref>. The main features of DL systems are: * The language contains unary relations called concepts which represent classes of objects in the domain and binary relations called roles which describe relationships between objects.

Reference-contexts: We now present a discussion of several relevant systems and the techniques employed for information brokering. A comparison of the various systems that perform information brokering is presented at the end of the chapter. 9.1 The InfoSleuth Project InfoSleuth <ref> [5] </ref> is a consortial research project at MCC which is developing technologies for addressing issues related to Information Brokering on the GII.

Reference-contexts: Affordable multimedia systems facilitate creation of multimedia documents, which are being stored in multimedia data repositories. With the explosive growth of the World Wide Web (WWW) <ref> [6] </ref>, millions of such repositories are being made available at an incredible rate. Information overload is the problem of keeping track of the locations, organization/structure, query languages, media-specific characteristics and information content of the various repositories.

Reference-contexts: In order to work with the two previously presented kinds of relationships in an homogeneous way the solution seems to be the integration of the user and the target ontology and using the deductive power of the DL system to obtain the immediate parents/children <ref> [7] </ref>. The process of ontology integration is accomplished as follows: 1. Rename and load the user and target ontologies in the DL system. 2. <p> Ontology Editors which shall enable system administrators to create and edit ontologies and define mappings from terms in the ontologies to the data structures in the underlying data repositories. Work in this direction has been done in <ref> [7, 59, 36] </ref>. Whereas the current emphasis is on infrastructral issues, our work points to the importance of the information based issues involved.

Reference-contexts: To determine if the resulting terms of the integrated ontology are primitive or defined (depending on whether A and B are primitive or defined), the rules described in <ref> [8] </ref> are applied.

Reference-contexts: We thus take an operational view of this repository. The DL definitions and the graphical representation of these ontologies are presented in Appendices D.2 and D.3. 1 A query is considered as a definition of the properties to be satisfied by the concepts listed in the answer <ref> [10] </ref>. 141 The LSDIS ontology The LSDIS ontology is a "home-grown" ontology which represents our view of our Lab's publications. The data is composed of several text, HTML and Postscript documents of the LSDIS Lab (http://www.cs.uga.edu/LSDIS/publications/) and is distributed over various files.

Reference-contexts: The main goal of this project is to provide access to multiple document collections, viewed as a unified global collection. A related project which also provides distributed indexing is the Harvest project <ref> [12] </ref>. The focus of this system is to provide fast and efficient indexing and this is achieved by appropriately replicating and distributing the indices. However they do not perform rank merging which is the focus of this project. The enhanced architecture of the InfoHarness System is illustrate in Figure 9.6.

Reference-contexts: While the issue of schematic/representational/structural heterogeneity have been addressed by a number of researchers <ref> [18, 14, 17, 51, 48] </ref>, the unique feature of our work 82 is the use of terms and c-contexts constructed from terms in domain specific ontologies to abstract out the schematic differences [46]. <p> This is called "conditioning" and is discussed in greater detail in the next section. 6.1.3 Data Value Incompatibility This class of conflicts covers incompatibilities that arise due to the values of the data present in different databases <ref> [14] </ref>. These conflicts are different from default value conflicts and attribute integrity constraint conflicts (Section 6.1.1) in that the latter are due to the differences in the definitions of the domain types of the attributes. Here we refer to the data values already existing in the database.

Reference-contexts: While the issue of schematic/representational/structural heterogeneity have been addressed by a number of researchers <ref> [18, 14, 17, 51, 48] </ref>, the unique feature of our work 82 is the use of terms and c-contexts constructed from terms in domain specific ontologies to abstract out the schematic differences [46]. <p> We refine the broad definition of this incompatibility given in <ref> [17] </ref>. For each incompatibility we discuss possible ways of mapping the schema elements to terms or c-contexts constructed from terms in domain specific ontologies describing the appropriate information domain for resolving the incompatibilities. <p> In some cases we shall discuss the use of transformer functions [61] that map instances from one domain type to a corresponding instance in another. This approach is similar to that of dynamic attributes [56] and abstract data types (ADTs) used in <ref> [17] </ref>. Transformer functions are discussed formally later in this chapter. 83 Attribute Naming Conflicts Two attributes that are termed synonyms if they are semantically alike and have different names. <p> We refine the broad definition of this class of conflicts given in <ref> [17] </ref>. For each incompatibility we discuss the possible ways of mapping the schema elements to terms or c-contexts constructed from terms in domain specific ontologies describing the appropriate information domain for resolving the incompatibilities.

Reference-contexts: While the issue of schematic/representational/structural heterogeneity have been addressed by a number of researchers <ref> [18, 14, 17, 51, 48] </ref>, the unique feature of our work 82 is the use of terms and c-contexts constructed from terms in domain specific ontologies to abstract out the schematic differences [46]. <p> (Residence, *) = state (Residence) where * is the discrepancy in the residence of the two objects and in this case may represent a generalization from of the residence area from the town to state. 6.1.4 Abstraction Level Incompatibility An early discussion of this class of conflicts was presented in <ref> [18] </ref> for schemas represented using the functional data model. These incompatibilities arise when two semantically similar entities are represented at differing levels of abstraction. Differences in abstraction can arise due to the different levels of generality and aggregation at which an entity (or attribute) is represented in the database.

Reference-contexts: In case the terms are in different ontologies then a holonym/meronym relationship will be established between the two terms. 6.1.5 Schematic Discrepancies This class of conflicts was discussed in <ref> [19, 51] </ref>. It was noted that these conflicts can take place within the same data model and arise when data in one database correspond to metadata of another database. We now analyze the problem and identify three aspects with help of an example given in [51].

File Systems The metadata typically stored in file systems are direct content based metadata, examples of which are inverted tree in WAIS [40] and document vectors in LSI <ref> [20] </ref>. Typically keyword-based queries are used to query these types of metadata. Mappings between terms in a vocabulary and data structures in the underlying repositories may also be stored in a file system. Databases A wide variety of metadata can (and should) be stored in structured databases.

Reference-contexts: Since the focus in the SIMS system is within one application domain, it lacks inter-domain adaptability. However it does support intra-domain adaptability via the query reformulation operations which use knowledge encoded in the form of interrelationships between concepts for selection of relevant information sources. 9.3 The TSIMMIS project TSIMMIS <ref> [22] </ref> The Stanford-IBM Manager of Multiple Information Sources is a system for integrating information. It offers a data model and a common query language that are designed to support the combining of information from many different sources.

Reference-contexts: Due to their ability to represent information at different levels of abstractions these systems must recover and assimilate information 197 from disparate sources. These systems allow a closer and detailed view of the data to an observer who wants to extract information. The VIMSYS data model <ref> [31] </ref> described a hierarchical representation of the data (Figure 9.8) using various levels of semantic interpretation that may satisfy needs of Infoscopes. At the image representation (IR) level, the actual image data is stored.

Reference-contexts: This process can be terminated on input from the user. This enhances scalability as computation of complex relationships between terms in a global ontology would take more time and may often give inconsistent answers. This approach has been suggested in multidatabase literature by Wiederhold [94] and Hammer and McLeod <ref> [32] </ref>. It may be noted that the key assumption in our approach is that the number of relationships across similar terms in component ontologies is an order of magnitude less than the total number of terms and relationships in a global ontology. <p> The main assumption behind the IRM is that the number of relationships between terms across ontologies is an order of magnitude smaller than the number of all the concepts and roles relevant to the system. Hammer and McLeod <ref> [32] </ref> have suggested a set of relationship descriptors to capture relationships between terms across different ontologies. A set of terminological relationships have been proposed in [63].

Reference-contexts: Caching approaches have been used to support efficient query processing on these views in <ref> [74, 33, 39] </ref>.

However, since abstractions by themselves cannot capture semantic similarity, they have to be associated either with the context <ref> [46] </ref> or with extra knowledge in order to capture the real world semantics. <p> Thus the mappings (relationship) between the attributes are determined through the extra knowledge associated with the concepts. We utilize a uniform formalism called schema correspondences <ref> [46] </ref> to represent the abstraction/mappings from the exported object O G to the corresponding object O in 99 the database. <p> In [52], a fixed set of descriptors define essential characteristics of the attribute and are used to generate mappings between them. We have discussed in <ref> [46] </ref> how they do not guarantee semantic similarity. Thus, any representation of c-context which can be described by a fixed set of descriptors is not appropriate. The descriptors (or meta-attributes) are not fixed but are dynamically chosen to model the characteristics of the application domain in question.

Reference-contexts: Issues of scalability in the Vocabulary Brokering Component One of the key issues that affect the scalability of the architecture in this component is what has been known as the global ontology assumption.

In our approach we visualize the vocabulary brokering component consists of a collection of domain specific ontologies. Interoperation across different ontologies is achieved by means of terminological relationships between terms across ontologies.

Reference-contexts: This component uses domain specific ontologies to characterize vocabularies and terminological relationships between them for interoperation. This helps reduce information overload as the number of terminological relationships between terms across ontologies is an order of magnitude smaller than the number of terms in all ontologies <ref> [61] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Attribute-based access Attribute-based access provides a powerful complementary or alternative search mechanism to traditional content-based search and access [77]. While attribute-based access can provide better precision <ref> [70] </ref>, it can be more complex as it requires that appropriate attributes have been identified and the corresponding metadata instantiated before accessing data. In Figure 3.3 we illustrate an example of attribute-based access in InfoHarness. <p> In this section, we evaluate loss of information based on precision and recall metrics <ref> [70] </ref> which have been widely used in Information Retrieval literature to measure the loss of information based on the proportion of irrelevant documents retrieved in response to a user query.

Reference-contexts: This process can be terminated on input from the user. This enhances scalability as computation of complex relationships between terms in a global ontology would take more time and may often give inconsistent answers. This approach has been suggested in multidatabase literature by Wiederhold <ref> [94] </ref> and Hammer and McLeod [32]. It may be noted that the key assumption in our approach is that the number of relationships across similar terms in component ontologies is an order of magnitude less than the total number of terms and relationships in a global ontology.
