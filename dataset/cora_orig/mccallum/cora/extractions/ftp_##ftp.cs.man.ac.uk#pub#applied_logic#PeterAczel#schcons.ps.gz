Title: Schematic Consequence  
Author: Peter Aczel 
Affiliation: Manchester University  
Abstract: The aim of this note is first to set up some general theory for discussing different aspects of the notion of a logic and then to draw attention to the schematic aspects of logic and suggest a way of capturing this aspect without making any commitment to the kind of syntax a logic should have.

Reference-contexts: In the next section below we give some definitions relevent to the first issue. We focus on finitary traditional consequence. More general notions are of interest. See for example <ref> [Avron, 1991] </ref>. But the more restricted and familiar notion of a consequence relation will be good enough for our present purposes. We also introduce several other notions which are relevent in connection with the formation of consequence relations either operationally from an axiomatic system or semantically from a semantic system.

Reference-contexts: As in the previous section the categories and functors that we will consider are all "over the category of sets". There is an interesting relationship between the notion of a consequence relation and Scott's notion of an information system, (see <ref> [Scott, 1982] </ref>). This gives rise to a relationship between closure systems and Scott domains. Essentially a Scott Information System can be viewed as a consequence relation (A; `) and a consistency notion Con for it; i.e.
