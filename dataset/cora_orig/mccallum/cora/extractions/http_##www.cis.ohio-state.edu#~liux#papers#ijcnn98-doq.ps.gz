Abstract: This paper presents a two-layer network for extracting hydrographic objects, such as rivers, from satellite images. The first layer is a locally connected network, which performs nonlinear smoothing. A unique property of the network is that boundaries and junctions are preserved with high accuracy while noise within each region is greatly suppressed. A second layer is a locally excitatory globally inhibitory oscillator network (LEGION), which extracts the desired objects. The seeds of objects are selected separately. To find hydrographic objects, seed points are automatically identified from the original image, based on the assumption that water bodies are homogenous. Computationally, this approach is parallel and local and can be effectively implemented using hardware directly, the efficiency of which may provide a potential solution for real-time image processing. Experimental results using digital orthophoto images are provided.

Reference-contexts: Linear filters replace each pixel value by a weighted average from its local neighborhood. The main drawback of Will appear in Proceedings of the IEEE International Joint Conference On Neural Networks, 1998 Page 2/6 linear filters is that image structures will be degraded while noise is reduced <ref> [1] </ref>. To overcome this problem, nonlinear filters are proposed. Essentially, nonlinear filters try to adaptively change the weights in the smoothing neighborhood so that desired features such as edges, corners, and junctions are preserved by preventing smoothing across object boundaries.

Reference-contexts: To show the effectiveness of our proposed filter, Fig. 6 (a) shows a small portion from Fig. 5 (a) and the corresponding portion of the smoothed image is shown in Fig. 6 (b). Figures 6 (c) and 6 (d) show the corresponding edge maps by a Canny edge detector <ref> [2] </ref> with s = 1.0 and the same hysteresis thresholds. Most salient edges in Fig. 6 (c) are preserved with high accuracy in Fig. 6 (d) while noisy segments are suppressed greatly.

Reference-contexts: Also hydrographic objects are shapeless and a generic model cannot be defined, and thus template matching techniques including line following algorithms, active contour models [5] and deformable template matching techniques <ref> [4] </ref> cannot be applied effectively. In this paper, we propose a two-layer network. The first layer is a locally connected network, which makes pixel values more reliable through nonlinear smoothing. Connection weights between two nodes are updated non-uniformly as a function of weights within their receptive fields.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the central issues in nonlinear filter design are how to estimate the presence of desired features and how to change the weights adaptively according to the estimation. To estimate the presence of edges, a popular choice is gradient. Therefore, many nonlinear filters are gradient-based. Lev et al. <ref> [7] </ref> proposed three similar methods of noise reduction by reecting the local discontinuity through weight configurations to avoid blurring image structures. Tomita and Tsuji [17] proposed a method which replaces each pixel by the average of the most homogeneous neighborhood among the five overlapped rectangular ones.

Reference-contexts: Figure 3 (c) shows the segmentation result using a gray map [21], where objects with different phases are encoded through distinct gray levels. As a comparison, we also applied anisotropic diffusion to the image shown in Fig. 3 (a). The diffusion was implemented using a program available in <ref> [13] </ref>. Figure 4 shows the results along with the results from the proposed method after the same number of iterations. It shows clearly that the proposed filter converges very quickly to a (a) (b) (c) piecewise constant state while anisotropic diffusion approaches to a uniform state slowly.

Reference-contexts: Also in general, many iterations may be needed and the number of iterations for best results varies considerably from image to image. In addition, gradient is estimated in general from a very local window, making it difficult to distinguish salient boundaries from noise edge segments. Smith and Brady <ref> [14] </ref> proposed a filter that modulates the Gaussian smoothing with brightness smoothing. While the authors claimed that their filter combines the advantages of existing noise reducing filters, the filter is not effective when noise is large. <p> While the authors claimed that their filter combines the advantages of existing noise reducing filters, the filter is not effective when noise is large.

The basic idea is to prefer diffusion along the direction where the gradient is small, making the diffusion nonuniform. <p> If we assume that the weight is a Gaussian function and the entire receptive field as one subreceptive field, we obtain a Gaussian filter. If we assume that the weight is simply the reciprocal of the connection weight, we obtain gradient inverse-weighted filter <ref> [19] </ref>. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear filter, we use a one-dimensional signal. In this case, there are two subreceptive fields, left and right windows. 1 (c) shows the result using a Gaussian smoothing filter. It is evident that the step edge was blurred and became a ramp.

Reference-contexts: second layer is a LEGION network [16][20]<ref> [21] </ref>, which provides a computationally effective framework for image segmentation based on temporal correlation [8][18]. Unlike other oscillatory networks [6][15], LEGION has been shown analytically [16][21] that it converges rapidly with a local and parallel architecture and has been applied to segment real images [21]. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes a locally connected network for nonlinear smoothing after a brief review of nonlinear filters. Section 3 describes the LEGION network which is used for image segmentation. Section 4 presents experimental results for synthetic and real images. <p> This is achieved using a LEGION network, which consists of locally coupled identical relaxation oscillators and a global inhibitor. A single oscillator i is modeled as a feedback loop between an excitatory unit x i and an inhibitory unit y i <ref> [21] </ref>: (3a) where H stands for the Heaviside step function. I i repre sents external stimulation for oscillator i, which is assumed to be applied at time 0. r denotes a Gaussian noise term to test the robustness of the system and play an active role in desynchronization. <p> An algorithm for the first layer can be derived easily. For the segmentation results shown in this paper, the smoothing images were obtained by running 10 iterations. For the second layer, a LEGION algorithm derived by Wang and Terman <ref> [21] </ref> is used with a separate seed selection procedure for digital orthophoto images. Fig. 3.

Salient boundaries are preserved while detail segments due to noise are smoothed out.

As a comparison, we also applied anisotropic diffusion to the image shown in Fig. 3 (a). The diffusion was implemented using a program available in [13].
