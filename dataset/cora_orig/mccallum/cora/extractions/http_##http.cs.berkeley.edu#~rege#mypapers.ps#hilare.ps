Title: Abstract  
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of non-holonomic motion planning for a class of mobile robots, namely Hilare-like robots. Results from the theory of non-linear systems and optimal control are used to demonstrate the controllability of such systems and to obtain a characterization of the time-optimal paths for such robots in the absence of obstacles. This characterization is applied to find locally time-optimal paths for the system and to obtain a non-holonomic motion planner for such robots navigating through obstacles. Though the ideas presented in this paper focus on a particular class of mobile robots, they should be be applicable to other types of robot systems.

Reference-contexts: The Maximum Principle of Pontryagin [P] is a powerful tool from classical optimal control theory which provides necessary conditions for the existence of an optimal control. There are various statements of the principle. A direct consequence of the PMP is the so-called bang-bang principle <ref> [AF] </ref> Consider a system of the form _ x = f [x (t)] + B [x (t)]u (t) (7) where x (t) 2 &lt; n , u (t) 2 &lt; m , f [x (t)] 2 &lt; n and B [x (t)] 2 &lt; nfim , where ju j (t)j 1. <p> Under certain continuity assumptions (see [P] or <ref> [AF] </ref>), we have, Lemma 1 (The Bang-Bang principle) Let u fl (t) be a time-optimal control for the system under consideration. Let x fl (t) and fl (t) be the corresponding state trajectory and costate. <p> The Bang-Bang Principle says that if the system under consideration is normal <ref> [AF, p. 381] </ref>, and an optimal control exists then it must necessarily lie on one of the corners of the hypercube of side 2 a max in &lt; m . at all instances till the goal state is achieved. However it is possible that the system is singular [AF, p. 381], <p> is normal <ref> [AF, p. 381] </ref>, and an optimal control exists then it must necessarily lie on one of the corners of the hypercube of side 2 a max in &lt; m . at all instances till the goal state is achieved. However it is possible that the system is singular [AF, p. 381], i.e. there is at least one interval (t 1 ; t 2 ] in [0; T fl ] such that n X b ij (x fl (t); t) i In this case, the Bang-Bang Principle does not apply. <p> The other cases, where u 2 alone is singular and both controls are singular can be dealt with similarly. For u 1 to be singular we have, <ref> [AF, pp. 481-493] </ref>, _ 4 = @v 1 This implies, 1 cos + 2 3 = 0 (11) 3 = d 2 2 sin (12) Hence _ 3 = d 2 2 cos _ (13) Putting _ = v 1 v 2 d and rearranging we get, _ 3 = (

Reference-contexts: The first stage of the planner finds a collision-free path for the robot without taking into account the non-holonomic constraints. This is essentially the problem of motion planning for a (possibly non-convex) polygon amidst polygonal obstacles. Avnaim et al. <ref> [ABF] </ref> give an algorithm which computes an exact boundary description of the free space in time O (n 3 log n) and a motion in time O (n 3 ). Here n is the number of vertices of the polygonal obstacles.

Reference-contexts: The contructive proof of this result was implemented in a planner in [LTCG]. The case of trailer-like robots is dealt with in [LSi]. Another planner for car-like robots (with or without trailers) is described in <ref> [BL] </ref> which also contains some of the background for the application of differential geometry concepts to control theory.

Thus, a system is fully controllable if and only if its Control Lie Algebra has maximal dimension.

Reference-contexts: The problem becomes even more complicated when the robot has to operate in a configuration space with obstacles. In this paper, we take first steps towards solving the time-optimal problem for a class of non-holonomic mobile robots, namely Hilare-like robots <ref> [GCV] </ref>. We use the Maximum Principle of Pontryagin to obtain a (partial) characterization of the time-optimal paths for such robots in the absence of obstacles. This characterization can be used to find locally time-optimal paths for the Hilare system. <p> Another focus has been to determine the time-optimal control for a manipulator moving along a predetermined path [BDG,SM].
