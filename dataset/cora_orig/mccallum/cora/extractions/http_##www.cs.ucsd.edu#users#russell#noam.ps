Abstract: We consider the formula size complexity of boolean functions over the base consisting of ^, _, and : gates. In 1961 Subbotovskaya proved that, for any boolean function on n variables, setting all but a randomly chosen *n variables to randomly chosen constants, reduces the expected complexity of the induced function by at least a factor of * 1:5 . This fact was used by Subbotovskaya to derive a lower bound of (n 1:5 ) for the formula size of the parity function, and more recently by Andreev who exhibited a lower bound of (n 2:5 = log O(1) (n)) for a function in P. We present the first improvement of Subbotovskaya's result, showing that the expected formula complexity of a function restricted as above is at most an O(* fl ) fraction of its original complexity, for fl = (21 73)=8 = 1:556:::.

Reference-contexts: Let A n denote the function over n variables defined in [2]. Theorem 2 DeMorgan formulas for A n require size (n 2:556::: ). Recently, Paterson and Zwick <ref> [1] </ref> have further improved the lower bound on fl to fl (5 3)=2 = 1:63:::, and hence also obtain a better lower bound for Andreev's function. Their proof combines ideas used here with some clever new techniques.

Reference-contexts: She used this to prove a lower bound of (n 1:5 ) on formula complexity of the parity function. (Later, [5] used different methods to obtain a tight fi (n 2 ) bound for parity.)

This gives an improvement in the lower bound for Andreev's function and allows us to give the best lower bound known so far for formulae size. Let A n denote the function over n variables defined in <ref> [2] </ref>. Theorem 2 DeMorgan formulas for A n require size (n 2:556::: ). Recently, Paterson and Zwick [1] have further improved the lower bound on fl to fl (5 3)=2 = 1:63:::, and hence also obtain a better lower bound for Andreev's function. <p> The best bounds are achieved when lk and 2 k are of the same order of magnitude. We thus prove the lower bound for the function A n defined on n = kl + 2 k variables where l = 2 k =k. Theorem 3 (Essentially due to <ref> [2] </ref>) DeMorgan formulas for A n require size n fl+1o (1) . Proof (of Theorem) In the course of the proof we will assume that fl satisfies that E [L (f * )] O (* fl L (f )).

Reference-contexts: This approach has achieved remarkable success in the study of constant depth circuits. Both the first and the strongest super-polynomial bounds for such circuits were proven by studying the effect of random restrictions on the circuit depth (see <ref> [3] </ref> for a survey). Much earlier, some success had been obtained by this approach concerning the formula size of boolean functions. When discussing formula size, one must be careful to specify the basis, since the formula size complexity may vary (by a polynomial) over different bases. <p> Such an assignment exists since there exists a boolean function on k variables with this complexity (see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>) and all boolean functions on k variables can be realized by restrictions to the f i 's. Let B be the restriction of A n to the remaining kl variables.

Reference-contexts: When discussing formula size, one must be careful to specify the basis, since the formula size complexity may vary (by a polynomial) over different bases. In this paper, we only consider the DeMorgan basis, which consists of ^; _ and : gates. Subbotovskaya <ref> [4] </ref> observed in 1961 that, for any (non-trivial) boolean function f on n variables, assigning random values to all but a randomly chosen subset of variables of size *n, reduces the formula complexity of the function by at least an expected * 1:5 factor. <p> This can be seen by the fact that the parity function has formulaes of size fi (n 2 ). The question of the exact value of fl remains open. We conjecture that Conjecture 1 fl = 2. In this paper we show that the fl 1:5 bound given by <ref> [4] </ref> is not tight and can be improved. We show that Theorem 1 fl 21 p 8 = 1:556:::. This gives an improvement in the lower bound for Andreev's function and allows us to give the best lower bound known so far for formulae size. <p> Lemma 1 (Essentially due to <ref> [4] </ref>) fl 1:5. The lemma will follow directly from propositions 2 and 3. Proposition 2 Let f be any function on n variables, with L (f ) 2. Let f 0 be the result of fixing one input, at random, to a random value.
