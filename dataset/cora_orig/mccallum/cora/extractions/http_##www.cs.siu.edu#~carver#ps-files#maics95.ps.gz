Title: Examining Some Assumptions of the FA/C Distributed Problem-Solving Paradigm

Abstract: The functionally-accurate, cooperative (FA/C) distributed problem-solving paradigm has been an important approach for organizing distributed problem solving among homogeneous, cooperating agents. They idea behind the FA/C approach is that agents can produce tentative, partial results based on only local information, and then exploit the constraints that exist among these local results to resolve uncertainties and global inconsistencies that result from the use of incomplete information. While this approach has been used in several implemented systems, there has been little formal analysis of the quality of the solutions that are produced by the approach or of the conditions that are necessary for the approach to be successful. This paper builds on work we have done to begin to formally analyze the quality of solutions that can be produced by FA/C systems, by examining some of the assumptions implicit in the approach. The analysis will be done in the context of distributed sensor interpretation.

The problem with this definition is that for many SI problems it is impractical to compute the MPE. This was explained in some detail in <ref> [4] </ref> (particularly as it relates to the differences between SI and the kinds of problems that are typically studied in research on abductive inference and probabilistic network inference). The upshot of this is that SI systems usually must use heuristic, satisficing approaches to construct solutions. <p> We are also currently extending our theorems from <ref> [4] </ref> by deriving specific probabilities in connection with the theorems as a function of domain models and acceptance thresholds; understanding how to formalize the effects of different evidence propagation and coordination strategies; extending the analyses to deal with processing of only subsets of the available data; and generalizing to CDPS tasks

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In the functionally accurate, cooperative (FA/C) paradigm for distributed problem solving <ref> [5, 7] </ref>, agents need not have all the information necessary to completely and accurately solve their subproblems. Instead, agents produce tentative, partial results based on local information and then exchange these results with the other agents to resolve local uncertainties and global inconsistencies. <p> It is also important to point out that we are examining only some aspects of FA/C problem solving: solution quality and the amount of data that must be communicated among agents. In other words, the paper concentrates on what was referred to as data uncertainty in <ref> [5, 7] </ref>. 2 In the next section we describe our model of distributed sensor interpretation and the distributed problem-solving model that we assume for our analysis. Section 3 contains the discussion of the assumptions behind the FA/C model and their implications for problem characteristics. <p> For example, dealing with what was referred to as control uncertainty in <ref> [5, 7] </ref> in terms of coordination strategies for efficient FA/C problem solving. <p> Another way that this requirement for limited communication can be fulfilled is if the tentative, partial local results (e.g. abstractions of the data) can substitute for the raw data in determining the global solutions. This is certainly the view of the developers of the FA/C paradigm. For example, <ref> [5] </ref> refers to consistency checking of the tentative local solutions with results received from other nodes as "an important part of the FA/C approach." However, we have come to recognize that the processing of results/abstractions may have to be considerably more sophisticated than suggested above.

Reference-contexts: A solution to an SI problem is a set of hypotheses that explains the available data. In general, there will be multiple possible alternative (uncertain) solutions, and we want to find the "best" solution. Ideally, this should be the most probable explanation (MPE) <ref> [8] </ref> given all of the available data. The problem with this definition is that for many SI problems it is impractical to compute the MPE.
