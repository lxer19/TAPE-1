Abstract: We present entirely automatic methods for gathering documents for a hypertext, linking the set, and annotating those connections with a description of the type (i.e., nature) of the link. Document linking is based upon high-quality information retrieval techniques developed using the Smart system. We apply an approach inspired by relationship visualization techniques and by graph simplification, to show how to identify automatically tangential, revision, summary, expansion, comparison, contrast, equivalence, and aggregate links. When we first began working in hypertext several years ago, we expected that it would soon be possible to extract these implicit links automatically with natural language processing or clever indexing techniques. . . , but we have been disappointed so far and we are starting to conclude that implicit [inter-]document links are . . . [I]f we created links based on our understanding of the document, some of the links won't fit with the understanding and context brought to the hypertext by another reader. Like a used textbook, some of the highlighting and margin notes may be useful to another student, but may be distracting or misleading at other Glushko implies that because of these problems there is little to be gained by looking for implicit inter-document links automatically. But such a sweeping dismissal is not necessary. Glushko's comments can also be used to point up the need for some descriptive information about the links themselves: his objections are overcome or at least lessened by a system which creates typed links. In this paper we present a technique for automatically linking documents of related subject matter. Moreover, an extension of the technique, inspired by document visualization, allows automatic classification of the link into several types from a pre-specified taxonomy of links. After listing the classes of link types and their meanings, we briefly present some visualizations and show how they inspire the link typing. Next we describe the method for simplifying the visual information so that it is useful and then show how that result is applied to choose a type. We finish with a brief mention of evaluation and then our conclusions. LINK TYPE TAXONOMY A link type is a description of the relationship between the source and the destination of a link. As such, it cannot be determined by considering only the destination document: the document could be an example of one concept, and a counterexample of another. Nor are link types symmetrical: following a link may lead to an expanded discussion of a topic, but returning along the link will clearly not do the same. best identified by the hypertext reader.[4]
