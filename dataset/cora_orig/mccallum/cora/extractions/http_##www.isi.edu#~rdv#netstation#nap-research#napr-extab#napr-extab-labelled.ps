Abstract: Work on network-attached peripherals (NAPs) can be divided into essentially three areas device interfaces and protocols, multimedia use and mass storage use. This paper is an extended abstract reviewing some of the current work and provides references and WWW pointers to many of the projects. The impact of this technological advance on operating systems is discussed. The primary purpose of this paper is to broaden understanding of the advantages and pitfalls of NAPs and encourage further research in the design and use of network-attached peripherals and NAP-capable systems. An expanded form of this document 1 is available on the web or from the author. 2

Reference-contexts: The obvious example is a special-purpose network node that provide NFS (Network File System)[52, 10] services only no general-purpose computing facilities. Examples include the Parity Systems Etherstore [42], Auspex NS7000 3 , Network Appliance 4 [28] and the Maximum Strategy proFILE XL RAID array <ref> [1] </ref>. However, the high-level protocol spoken by these is NFS, which provides file-oriented service, an operating system dependent interface. Thus, they would qualify as file servers rather than network-attached peripherals.

Reference-contexts: A parallel copper connection can be switched over computer-room distances, or used as a simple channel. Often used in conjunction with an ethernet for a back channel or control network, as HiPPI interfaces are unidirectional <ref> [3, 49] </ref>. HiPPI can also carry TCP/IP network as a high-speed LAN. IBM's Serial Storage Architecture (SSA) is a relatively new interface. There is a collection of pages at the SSA Industry Association 8 .

Reference-contexts: A disadvantage of this is the potentially long latency to begin a transfer. Others use IPI-3 or a particular SCSI protocol (such as the Fibre Channel Protocol, FCP <ref> [4] </ref> as the transport protocol to insure the fidelity and ordering of data as it is sent through the network.

Reference-contexts: These are all block-oriented protocols. IPI-3 provides transport up through application layers in the ISO networking model. SCSI relies on the lower-level network interfaces to provide some of these services. SCSI has grown into what is known as SCSI-3 <ref> [5] </ref> partially as a result of the desire to use SCSI for NAPs. It has been suggested that certain aspects of the SCSI model have shortcomings from a networking point of view.

Reference-contexts: The High Performance Storage System 20 (HPSS)[59] being developed at the National Storage Lab 21 uses NAPs. This is quite probably the most advanced work on network attached peripherals, and has been tackling the important issues of security and parallel transfers. The Parallel Transport Protocol proposal <ref> [7] </ref> is related to HPSS. There is some related work in the Sequoia 2000 22 project on the network aspects 23 of mass storage and especially operating system I/O.

Numerous studies on I/O performance <ref> [8] </ref> and file system design [40, 17, 14, 16] have been done.

Reference-contexts: A disk node provides stable storage, typically managed by the operating system of a host node. As a distributed system, the existing body of research on issues such as resource discovery, deadlock, naming, caching, etc. is all relevant. Especially important is the work on distributed file systems <ref> [36, 58, 41, 22, 9, 58] </ref>. An important realization is that the resources are truly distributed. A disk drive that "belongs" to no processor may contain a file system that is shared by multiple clients, necessitating a new synchronization policy between clients.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the server manages the data and initiates transfers, but need not be in the data path, a canonical example of third-party transfers and the uses of network-attached peripherals. The TickerTAIP distributed RAID array <ref> [11] </ref> is composed of network-attached disks. It represents important work in calculation and management of distributed parity, especially for small writes. As covered in section 3.2, Cray has implemented a Shared File System for a HiPPI RAID array.

Reference-contexts: NAPs have been used in hierarchical storage systems for a number of years (primarily HiPPI disk arrays), but the increasing speed and sophistication of both the peripherals and the HSM software has truly brought NAPs to the forefront recently. See Coleman and Watson <ref> [13] </ref> for a good introduction to HSM (and good references on the history of network-attached peripherals).

Reference-contexts: The HSC, CDC, and MaxStrat controllers are clearly block servers, and the Auspex clearly is a file server; the RAID-II is more of a hybrid system. The RAID-II system developed at UC Berkeley <ref> [18] </ref> blurs the distinction between network-attached RAID array and file server. The host system behaves as a typical NFS server to most clients.

Reference-contexts: Thus, one rogue client can still compromise the file system.

Reference-contexts: Non-cooperating clients (or unauthorized requests originating at normally cooperating clients) could potentially read or modify any directory or file or file system metadata.

Reference-contexts: Typically the controller is transparent to the mainframe, and copies the data to the local disk as well as the remote disk, buffering the data as necessary for the network transfer.

Reference-contexts: Others use IPI-3 or a particular SCSI protocol (such as the Fibre Channel Protocol, FCP [4] as the transport protocol to insure the fidelity and ordering of data as it is sent through the network. Maximum Strategy, as part of Cray's Shared File System effort <ref> [39] </ref>, has augmented their Gen 5 storage array, which uses the IPI-3 command set, to include support for semaphores at the device. Note that the storage array itself attaches no semantic meaning to the semaphores; cooperating clients running the SFS must agree on the meanings of the semaphores.

Reference-contexts: The obvious example is a special-purpose network node that provide NFS (Network File System)[52, 10] services only no general-purpose computing facilities. Examples include the Parity Systems Etherstore <ref> [42] </ref>, Auspex NS7000 3 , Network Appliance 4 [28] and the Maximum Strategy proFILE XL RAID array [1]. However, the high-level protocol spoken by these is NFS, which provides file-oriented service, an operating system dependent interface. Thus, they would qualify as file servers rather than network-attached peripherals.
