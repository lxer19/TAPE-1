Title: Parallel Implicit Methods for Aerodynamics

Note: Contemporary Mathematics Volume 00, 0000  
Abstract: Domain decomposition (Krylov-Schwarz) iterative methods are natural for the parallel implicit solution of multidimensional systems of boundary value problems that arise, for instance, in aerodynamics. They provide good data locality so that even a high-latency workstation network can be employed as a parallel machine. Matrix-free (Newton-Krylov) methods are natural when it is unreasonable to compute or store a true Jacobian. We call their combination Newton-Krylov-Schwarz and report experimental progress on two algorithmic aspects: the use of a coarse grid in additive Schwarz preconditioning and the use of mixed discretization schemes in the (implicitly defined) Jacobian and its preconditioner. Two model problems in two-dimensional compressible flow are considered: the full potential equation, and the Euler equations.

Reference-contexts: The simplest domain decomposition preconditioner is block Jacobi, which can be regarded as a zero-overlap form of additive Schwarz <ref> [2] </ref>. The convergence rate of block Jacobi can be improved, at the price of a higher cost per iteration, with subdomain overlap and (for many problems) by solving an additional judiciously chosen coarse grid system. 2.

Reference-contexts: Though space does not permit a meaningful discussion, we mention that both codes have been executed on an ethernet network of workstations using a package of distributed sparse linear system routines developed at Argonne National Laboratory by Gropp and Smith <ref> [4] </ref>, with p4 as the data exchange layer. When exact solvers are used on each subdomain, speedups on a per iteration basis are seen on up to 16 processors, but exact solvers are an extreme case.

Reference-contexts: J on an arbitrary Krylov vector w can be approximated by J (u l )w * f (u l + *w) f (u l ) : PARALLEL IMPLICIT METHODS FOR AERODYNAMICS 3 Finite-differencing with * makes matrix-free methods potentially much more susceptible to finite word-length effects than ordinary Krylov methods <ref> [5] </ref>. Steady aerodynamics applications require the solution of linear systems that lack strong diagonal dominance, so a secondary goal of our investigation is to verify that properly-scaled matrix-free methods can be employed in this context. For brevity, details are deferred to a later paper.
