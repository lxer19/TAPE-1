Title: View FS  
Author: Akash Sagar, Krishnan, Vishwanath 
Date: May 11, 1998  
Abstract: Exploiting the locality of client accesses by prefetching and minimising the disk access overhead would lead to a considerable improvement in performance of client caches. In this project we attempt to exploit this locality using the notion of Views for prefetching and also reduce the disk overheads incurred by using an alternate file system. We have built a View File System which incorporates these ideas. We present a series of simulation results that demonstrate the improvement by using these key ideas.

Reference-contexts: In a performance analysis of the Squid proxy cache by Rousskov et al <ref> [2] </ref>, disk accesses were seen to be a bottleneck. So, optimizing the disk access overheads can result in improved cache performance. Also, client accesses to the web exhibit a high degree of locality, with files being accessed in clusters. This locality extends across client sessions.

Reference-contexts: However, the performance of the system needs to be studied over various disk and buffer sizes and client traces to reinforce this belief. Related work has been done by Mogul and Padmanabhan in <ref> [3] </ref>, where they define the views based on probability graphs. However, this definition is more suited for proxy caches rather than client caches. Griffioen et al have done related work on automatic prefetching of files over a WAN in ([4])
