Abstract: Today's first topic is parallel complexity, which is a continuation of the last day's topic. The second topic is calculating the greatest common divisor. Some results about the greatest common divisor are given including the Euclidean algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Example 1.2 Addition can be accomplished in linear size and O (lg n) depth. This is based on a technique called carry look-ahead. The proof of this is left as an exercise (see Exercise 27 in <ref> [1] </ref>). It is believed by complexity theorists that N C is strictly contained in N P . 2 Greatest Common Divisor The greatest common divisor of two integers u and v, written d = gcd (u; v), is defined by these properties: 1. <p> It is known that F n = p ; where ff = 1+ p 2 and fi = 1 5 2 . Since jfij &lt; 1, we have jfi n j ! 0 and hence, F n ~ p = fi (ff n ): Lemma 1 (4.2.1 in <ref> [1] </ref>) Given the notation above, we have u F n+2 and v F n+1 . We will use this lemma to obtain our refined bit complexity of the Euclidean algorithm next class meeting.
