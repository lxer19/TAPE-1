Title: Using Internet Emulation to Study Wide-Area Applications  
Author: Neal Cardwell, Richard Fromm, and Rich Martin 
Address: California-Berkeley  
Affiliation: Computer Science Division, University of  
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of Network Emulation, which is simulating a network in real time using live applications to drive the simulation. We describe our emulation apparatus and demonstrate that it can be calibrated to correctly emulate a wide range of wide-area networks. We run an experiment comparing the web browsing performance of ISDN, cable modems, and Direct Broadcast Satellite using our emulation system. We find that for a variety of web-pages, cable-modems outperform both ISDN and DBS systems. Surprisingly, ISDN is superior to DBS for many web-pages.

Reference-contexts: Our emulation environment would allow a study where these parameters can be varied in a control fashion and the user's perceived utility can be gauged. 6 Related Work The closest related work is the system constructed at USC used to study the performance of TCP-Vegas <ref> [1] </ref>. In their system, hitbox, a delay was added to each packet inside the kernel of the workstations. The delay parameters and queue sizes could be modified according to WAN link which was to modeled. <p> The delay parameters and queue sizes could be modified according to WAN link which was to modeled. The USC study a single workstation to simulate each router or endpoint in the emulated network. Another emulation environment is referenced in <ref> [1] </ref>. They mention that a group at AT&T started but did not complete a wide-area network emulator out of Transputers [5]. VINT, the Virtual InterNetwork Testbed, is an ongoing network simulator project that has some goals similar to ours [12].

Reference-contexts: Table 2 shows the web pages that we used for our measurements. They are roughly classified into three categories, High, Medium, and Low, according to their graphical content. A client running Netscape was attached to host 1, and a server running the public domain Apache web server <ref> [2] </ref> was attached to host 3 (see Figure 2). Both the client and server were unmodified applications. The local pages which are typically served by the web server running on www.cs.berkeley.edu were already visible to our server, with no additional effort.

Reference-contexts: It is based on the x-kernel , an object-based framework for implementing network protocols developed by Larry Peterson's group [7] <ref> [3] </ref>. In order to make the simulator run as a real-time network emulator, we made three significant changes to x-sim . The nature of these changes were mostly independent from the structure of x-sim and generally would have been necessary regardless of the chosen simulation engine.

Reference-contexts: The gateway process also includes simple packet filters to monitor TCP SYN and FIN packets. The filters are most easily maintained at user-level rather than in the kernel. 2.2 Network Emulation The simulator is a modified version of the x-sim network simulator from the University of Arizona <ref> [4] </ref>. x-Sim provides a complete and realistic framework for developing, analyzing, and testing network protocols. It is based on the x-kernel , an object-based framework for implementing network protocols developed by Larry Peterson's group [7] [3].

Reference-contexts: However, in order to maintain adequate performance, the network forwarding the packets must be faster than the emulated network. For the fast network glue, we use Active Messages (AM) over Myrinet, running on the Berkeley Network of Workstations (NOW) <ref> [8] </ref>. The performance of AM is enough to emulate a wide variety of networks. AM obtains a 45 sec one-way latency, 6 sec of overhead, an a peak bandwidth of 40MB/s.

We considered using ns, but we decided that x-sim would be better suited as a real-time emulator since it is entirely implemented in C, and we feared that the interpreted Tcl code of which ns partly consists would hurt its overall performance.
