Title: Meter as Mechanism: A Neural Network that Learns Metrical Patterns  
Author: Michael Gasser, Douglas Eck and Robert Port 
Keyword: Meter in Music and Speech  
Affiliation: Cognitive Science Program Indiana University  
Abstract: One kind of prosodic structure that apparently underlies both music and language is meter. Yet detailed measurements of both music and speech show that the nested periodicities that define metrical structure are noisy in some sense. What kind of system could produce or perceive such variable metrical timing? And what would it take to store particular metrical patterns in the long-term memory of the system? We have developed a network of coupled oscillators that both produces and perceives metrical patterns of pulses. In addition, beginning with an initial state with no biases, it learns to prefer 3-beat patterns (like waltzes) over 2-beat patterns. Models of this general class could learn to entrain to musical patterns. And given a way to process speech to extract appropriate pulses, the model should be applicable to metrical structure in speech as well. Is language metrical? Meter refers both to particular sorts of patterns in time and to an abstract description of such patterns, potentially a cognitive representation of them. In both cases there are two or more hierarchical levels at which equally spaced events occur, and the periods characterizing these levels are integral multiples of each other (usually 2 or 3). The hierarchy is implied in standard Western musical notation, where the different levels are indicated by kinds of notes (quarter notes, half notes, etc.) and by bars separating measures. For example, in a basic waltz-time meter, there are individual beats, all with the same spacing, grouped into sets of three with every third one receiving a stronger accent. In such a meter, there is a hierarchy consisting of both a faster periodic cycle (at the beat level) and a slower one (the measure level) that is 1/3 as fast with its onset (or zero phase angle) coinciding with the zero phase angle of every third beat. Metrical systems like this seem to underlie most forms of music around the world and are often said to underlie human speech as well (Jones, 1932; Martin, 1972). However, an awkward difficulty is that the definition employs the notion of an integer since data on both music and speech show clearly that the perfect temporal ratios predicted by such a definition are not observed in performance. In music performance, various kinds of systematic temporal deviations in the timing specified by musical notation are known to

Reference-contexts: The output of the unit at this point is shown. that the model is capable of acquiring more complex rhythms, for example, meters with three levels, patterns with alternating meters, or periodic patterns containing rests <ref> (Gasser & Eck, 1996) </ref>. We also need a principled way of determining when the network has "settled" in its response to a periodic pattern. Is speech metrical? We believe that it often is, at least in many languages.

Reference-contexts: The input to the input/output unit is similar, except that it has no periodic input function (because the frequency of the input is not known). The activation function for oscillators is a slightly modified version of the familiar activation update rule of the interactive activation and competition model <ref> (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1981) </ref>. Activation changes as follows: METER AS MECHANISM 22 After training, the input/output unit is driven by an input pattern with duple meter, then allowed to vary.

Reference-contexts: The network has successfully auto-associated the pattern if the sequence of activations in the network, including the input/output unit itself, does not change significantly when the input/output unit is unclamped. Learning in SONOR is based on the Contrastive Hebbian Learning (CHL) algorithm <ref> (Movellan, 1990) </ref>. CHL is designed for supervised learning: for each input pattern, the system is also provided with an associated target pattern. As we will see, however, it METER AS MECHANISM 11 is straightforward to implement auto-association with CHL. <p> Coupling is also constrained by a "refractory period," which prevents phase adjust ment in an oscillator which has recently reset its phase to zero. Learning In the simulations described here, there is learning on both normal and coupling connections. As in standard Contrastive Hebbian Learning <ref> (Movellan, 1990) </ref>, the weight changes are i;j W where L is a learning rate constant and W + i;j and W i;j are the weight change values accumulated during the wakeful and sleeping phases.

To respond more to particular meters than to others. For example, learning some languages, such as Warao, would involve learning that feet consist of two syllables (Hayes, 1981). 3. To respond differentially to more than one frequently occurring pattern.
