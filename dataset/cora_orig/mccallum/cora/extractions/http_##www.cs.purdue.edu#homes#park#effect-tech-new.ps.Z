Abstract: Recent measurements of network traffic have shown that self-similarity is an ubiquitous phenomenon present in both local area and wide area networks. In previous work, we have shown a simple, robust application layer causal mechanism of traffic self-similarity, namely, the transfer of objects or files in a generic network system where the file size distributions are heavy-tailed. In this paper, we study the effect of scale-invariant burstiness on network performance when the protocol stack and the interaction of traffic sources sharing bounded network resources are incorporated. First, we present a framework for understanding the two principal performance implications of self-similar traffic|concentrated periods of congestion and amplified packet loss/queueing delay. Using performance measurements, we show that the former is an intrinsic performance effect of self-similar bursty traffic that cannot be easily curtailed. The latter, however, is a conditional performance effect whose manifestation depends on the relative magnitude of network resources vis-a-vis traffic burstiness. We use the notion of asymmetry effect to characterize when self-similar burstiness leads to amplified packet loss and queueing delay. Second, we present extensive performance measurements that show the performance impact of self-similar burstiness, network resources (bandwidth/buffer capacity), and congestion control on network performance and the resultant traffic characteristics. We show that burstiness| when it does adversely impact|causes a linear degradation in packet loss rate while leading to a superlinear degradation of queueing delay. We show that there exists a sensitive quality of service (QoS) trade-off relation between packet loss and queueing delay under self-similar traffic conditions which aggrevates the problem of efficiently provisioning services to QoS-sensitive applications. Lastly, we study the influence of congestion control in modulating performance. We use flow-controlled UDP transport to discern the performance impact and traffic shaping effect of congestion control, and we give a comparative study of TCP Tahoe, Reno, and Vegas with respect to their performance characteristics when subject to self-similar bursty traffic.

Reference-contexts: In a somewhat different approach to the performance question <ref> [12, 34] </ref>, the influence of time scale is taken into account when discerning the impact of long-range dependence on queueing. It is shown that for small buffer sizes and short time scales, long-range dependence has only a marginal influence on queueing behavior with short-range correlations being the dominant factor. <p> On the other hand, if network resources are such that they can absorb much of the burstiness of one but not the other, then significant performance differences are possible. This is also consistent with analytical results reported in <ref> [12, 34] </ref>. When self-similar burstiness manifests itself negatively on performance, in particular, packet loss rate, it is due to an asymmetry effect whereby the packet drops stemming from f (t) &gt; g (t) periods dominate those emanating from the corresponding periods where g (t) &gt; f (t).

In a nutshell, this process involves the generation of object or file transfers across a network whose size distribution is heavy-tailed (formal definition given later). <p> Previously we have shown that this high-level structural mechanism suffices to generate self-similar traffic, and the degree of self-similar burstiness observed at the link is directly related to the heavy-tailedness of the file size distribution <ref> [26] </ref>. An important advantage of this scheme over traditional queueing modeling set-ups is that self-similar burstiness can be induced and controlled at the application layer while being oblivious to the ongoings of the rest of the system including the lower layers of the protocol stack. <p> The latter leads to coupling of traffic sources stemming from the shar-ing of bounded network resources by multiple traffic streams which can introduce nonlinearities into the system.

Reference-contexts: These works have shown that long-range dependence is an ubiquitous phenomenon occurring in diverse network environments, and even individual traffic sources such as variable bit-rate (VBR) video have been shown to possess correlation structure that can be modeled|along with several other models <ref> [11, 15, 13, 19, 34] </ref>|using self-similar traffic models. This also represents an instance of a real-world traffic source which, on its own, exhibits self-similar burstiness as a source-intrinsic property. <p> In a somewhat different approach to the performance question <ref> [12, 34] </ref>, the influence of time scale is taken into account when discerning the impact of long-range dependence on queueing. It is shown that for small buffer sizes and short time scales, long-range dependence has only a marginal influence on queueing behavior with short-range correlations being the dominant factor. <p> On the other hand, if network resources are such that they can absorb much of the burstiness of one but not the other, then significant performance differences are possible. This is also consistent with analytical results reported in <ref> [12, 34] </ref>. When self-similar burstiness manifests itself negatively on performance, in particular, packet loss rate, it is due to an asymmetry effect whereby the packet drops stemming from f (t) &gt; g (t) periods dominate those emanating from the corresponding periods where g (t) &gt; f (t).
