Reference-contexts: Another approach is to sample the states of the system stochastically, and derive the statistical measurements directly. This procedure falls under the broad category of Monte 1 Carlo (MC) simulation. Particle simulations usually involve a specific kind of MC, developed by Metropolis et. al <ref> [1] </ref> several decades ago, which uses a priori knowledge of the relative state distribution (e.g. the Boltzmann distribution).

Reference-contexts: The random walk behavior of MMC is avoided, but the discretization of Hamilton's equations introduces an intrinsic error to the simulation (fl (* 2 ) in the case of leap-frog discretization, where * is the size of the time step) <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> HMC is a variant of MMC, and will sample the canonical ensemble correctly provided that detailed balance is maintained. In the next section, we will show explicitly that detailed balance is satisfied for our RHMC. However, we refer the reader to Neal <ref> [2] </ref> for a proof that the original HMC algorithm satisfies this requirement. 4 Randomized HMC 4.1 Algorithm We modify the HMC algorithm by randomly selecting subsets of variables to be updated during the dynamic run.

Reference-contexts: A principal disadvantage is that dynamical information is lost, but as far as retrieving statistical information about particle systems, MMC has proven to be very effective. Over the past few years, hybrid models have emerged, in which the properties of MC are combined with those of MD <ref> [3] </ref>. Guarnieri and Still [4] developed an alternating MMC / MD scheme, which was found to sample a system of n-pentane molecules significantly faster than MMC or MD alone.

Reference-contexts: Over the last decade, there has been much literature concerning the use of randomized algorithms in other areas of computer 2 science. These algorithms make decisions based on random number generation, and have proven to be substantially quicker than their sequential counterparts in areas such as sorting and classification <ref> [6] </ref>. We carry the concept of randomized selection to HMC, in the form of randomized particle selection [7]. Rather than update the entire set of positions and momenta each dynamic run, we choose to update random subsets of these variables.

Reference-contexts: Care must be taken to use time steps which are small enough to ensure stability and accuracy, which inevitably slows convergence. 5 3 Hybrid Monte Carlo In the canonical ensemble, the states fg of a system S are distributed according to the Boltzmann probability distribution <ref> [8] </ref>, %() = Z 1 exp (fiH ()); (1) where fi = (k B T ) 1 , H is the Hamiltonian, and Z is the partition function, Z = 2S In order to sample from this ensemble, the probability distribution must be taken into account. <p> However, if there is a correlation between the points (as is common with a Markov chain, like RHMC), these variances in population statistics will increase proportionally to the length s of the correlation <ref> [8] </ref>: &lt;U&gt; n = n &lt; ffiU 2 &gt; n ; (21) and 2 &lt;ffiU 2 &gt; n = s &lt; ffiU 2 &gt; 2 n : (22) harmonic oscillators with = 0: The randomized MD (jS D j = 50) requires twice as many steps as the non-randomized MD (jS

Reference-contexts: A better way of sampling these regions is by specifying the system in terms of its independent variables ~q and their conjugates ~p (e.g. position coordinates and momenta). The hyperplane can be dynamically explored by following Hamilton's equations of motion <ref> [9] </ref>, @q i = @p i @p i = @q i 6 Equations (3) and (4) conserve energy, keeping the system on the same hyperplane.

Reference-contexts: If the dynamic motion follows Hamilton's equations, Liouville's theorem <ref> [10] </ref> asserts that the volume of phase space will remain constant, d 0 = d.
