Abstract: A cost-effective distributed shared memory (DSM) system typically uses a limited directory protocol to enforce cache coherence. This paper presents a new family of protocols, called Limited directory with Region-based Broadcast (Limited-RB), to efficiently implement cache coherence in wormhole routed DSM systems. This protocol family uses multidestination-based cache invalidation mechanisms to distribute invalidation requests to and collect the associated acknowledgments from separate regions. As a result, a write invalidation can be accomplished with fewer messages, less network traffic, and reduced occupancy at home nodes. These reductions contribute to decreasing invalidation latency and improving overall system performance. Directory organization under this new protocol is developed for 2D systems with e-cube routing and evaluated through simulations for a set of applications. The results indicate that with a small directory storage, the Limited-RB protocol family can achieve superior performance at a much lower cost compared to the LimitLESS protocol. For a 2D system, it is observed that a row-based Limited-RB protocol using a directory storage equivalent to 3 pointers outperforms the LimitLESS protocol using 5 pointers. The results demonstrate that faster and less expensive DSM systems can be built using the new approach.

Reference-contexts: A recent comprehensive evaluation of LimitLESS protocols was conducted by Chaiken and Agarwal in <ref> [1] </ref>. The conclusion is that a LimitLESS protocol provides adequate performance with respect to a fully-mapped protocol by only using a small amount of directory pointer space. Contrary to the above scheme, a coherence protocol with broadcast mode handles pointer overflow in a much simpler way.

Reference-contexts: For example, in a system supporting e-cube routing (messages are routed first along the row and then along the column), a multidestination worm can cover a set of destinations in row/column/row-column order. Adaptive routing systems like planar adaptive system <ref> [2] </ref>, turn-model [9] and fully-adaptive [5] provide more flexibility when compared to e-cube systems for multidestination worms. The adaptivity provides a greater choice of legal paths in addition to the ones allowed by the e-cube routing. Such additional paths are shown as bold lines in the figure.

Reference-contexts: These factors lead to severe performance degradation. Recently, multidestination message-passing mechanisms have been introduced for wormhole networks to achieve low-latency multicast [12, 18] and gather [17] operations on distributed memory systems. Most recently, we have successfully applied the multidestination message-passing mechanisms to DSM systems to reduce the invalidation overheads <ref> [3, 4] </ref> in cache coherence protocols. New cache invalidation mechanisms like i-ack buffer, i-reserve worm, and i-gather worms have been developed. These invalidation mechanisms are very effective for reducing the invalidation messages, total network traffic, and invalidation latency for any k-ary n-cube wormhole routed DSM systems. <p> New cache invalidation mechanisms like i-ack buffer, i-reserve worm, and i-gather worms have been developed. These invalidation mechanisms are very effective for reducing the invalidation messages, total network traffic, and invalidation latency for any k-ary n-cube wormhole routed DSM systems. However, a major portion of the study in <ref> [3, 4] </ref> is geared to improve the overall performance system using fully-mapped directory organizations and the associated protocols. This leads to a challenge whether multidestination message passing mechanism can be used to support cache coherency protocols with limited directory organizations. <p> Next, we present an overview of the operational principles of i-ack buffers and multidestination-based reservation and gather worms <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Finally, we discuss the flexibility in choosing regions in a 2D system and using reservation and gather worms to achieve efficient region-based distribution of invalidation requests and collection of acknowledgments. 4.1 Overview of Multidestination Message Passing Mechanism Traditionally, wormhole-routed systems have supported only point-to-point (unicast) message passing mechanism. <p> These features are the key supports provided by hardware and used by the reservation and gather worms to implement efficient cache invalidations. I-ack Buffer: The use of a special buffer (i-ack buffer) was introduced in <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. An i-ack buffer can hold the invalidation acknowledgment (i-ack signal) of a processing node for a memory block for a short period of time at the router interface. The entries of an i-ack buffer (i-ack entries) are shared among the ongoing invalidation transactions that a node participates in. <p> These entries are accessed by the associated processor via memory-mapped I/O references. Figure 4 shows the design of the i-ack buffer at a router interface, as proposed in <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. Reservation Worm: A multidestination-based invalidation reservation (i-reserve) worm is used to deliver an invalidation request to multiple destinations, the sharing nodes of a memory block, and reserve the i-ack buffer with a single message. <p> The flits of the worm are forwarded to an adjacent router as well as copied either to the system buffer of the associated processor-router interface [18] or to the storage in the i-ack buffer at the router interface depending on the availability of consumption channels and the i-ack buffer <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. It is to be noted that such a worm is quite powerful and can deliver a message to multiple destinations much faster using less number of messages compared to unicast message passing. <p> Instead of forwarding and copying a flit at the router of each intermediate destination, an i-gather worm gathers/collects invalidation acknowledgment (supplied by the associated processor) at the router interface and proceeds ahead <ref> [3, 4, 16, 17] </ref>. The i-gather worm, after arriving at a router interface, checks whether the i-ack signal is `on' indicating that the associated node has invalidated the corresponding cache block. If the signal is `on', the worm collects the information and proceeds ahead. <p> Since in this paper our main goal is to demonstrate the potential of Limited-RB protocol, we do not discuss the operational principles of i-req, i-reverse, i-gather worms, i-ack hits, and i-ack misses. Interested readers are encouraged to refer <ref> [3, 4] </ref> for more detailed information about these. 5.2 An Illustration Let us consider an example invalidation in a DSM using the LimitLESS protocol and the Limited-RowB protocol as shown in Fig. 5 (a) and Fig. 5 (b), respectively.

The testbed implements a CC-NUMA k-ary n-cube DSM system and models both internodal and intranodal communication precisely. A flit-level network simulator is invoked to simulate the network traffic, link contentions, and hot spot effects.

Reference-contexts: In practice, any large scale DSM system can only afford to have a small number of hardware pointers associated with each directory entry. Such a directory is commonly referred to as limited directory. Many interesting coherence protocols <ref> [6, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20] </ref> have been proposed or implemented in the past few years to enforce the coherence using a limited directory. <p> In the category with no broadcast mode, there are two variations: eviction protocol [20] and software extended protocol <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> First the large number of invalidation requests and acknowledgments messages caused by a pointer eviction. Second, the high latency for a read operation which causes a pointer eviction. Third, in the worst case, a thrashing of directory pointers may occur. The Alewife <ref> [6] </ref> machine implements an interesting alternative protocol with no broadcast mode by software extension. The protocol is called Limited directory Locally Extended through Software Support (LimitLESS) protocol.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 discusses simulation experiments and the results. Finally, concluding remarks are made in section 7. 2 Limited Directory Organizations The number of directory pointers implemented in hardware is a very important design parameter for a DSM system. The DASH <ref> [7] </ref> machine uses a fully-mapped directory organization/protocol at cluster level. In a fully-mapped directory, every processing node is represented by a single bit in a fixed position in the directory entry of each memory block.

Reference-contexts: A naive approach is to send a unicast message each to every node in the system. This incurs an explosion of invalidation related messages. As a better design, the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel (WWT) <ref> [8] </ref> virtual machine used a separate broadcast network available on the host machine CM-5 to send out the invalidation requests. A drawback of such an approach is that it is very costly to design a separate broadcast network for invalidation purpose only on a real DSM machine.

Reference-contexts: In the recent past, many interesting limited directory coherence protocols have been proposed. Most of these protocols only use a point-to-point communication mechanism. However, when a write invalidation occurs, such an approach requires a large number of control messages, generates heavy network traffic, and increases occupancy <ref> [11] </ref> at home nodes. These factors lead to severe performance degradation. Recently, multidestination message-passing mechanisms have been introduced for wormhole networks to achieve low-latency multicast [12, 18] and gather [17] operations on distributed memory systems.

Such an approach leads to high latency for these operations as well as large number of message exchanges in the system. In <ref> [12] </ref> Ni first introduced a Hamiltonian path-based routing to support multidestination messages (a message with multiple destinations). Such a mechanism allows a multicast/broadcast message to be consumed at a destination node while being forwarded (i.e., absorb-and-forward) to the next node concurrently.

We identify R as the base-routing. <p> Such a worm consists of a set of destinations in its header, as discussed earlier.

Many interesting coherence protocols <ref> [6, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20] </ref> have been proposed or implemented in the past few years to enforce the coherence using a limited directory. <p> In the category with no broadcast mode, there are two variations: eviction protocol <ref> [20] </ref> and software extended protocol [6].

Reference-contexts: However, 2 for a large DSM system with many nodes, such a fully-mapped directory organization/protocol posts a prohibitively high cost in storage requirement. Its poor scalability far outweighs any potential performance advantages that it may provide. In an earlier study <ref> [21] </ref>, Weber and Gupta discovered that during the execution of DSM applications, the statistical distribution of invalidation degree generally fits into a bimodal model. Furthermore, the distribution of most existing applications has a dominant major mode at very small degrees, like 1 or 2. <p> This mode is caused by a small portion of global data widely shared by almost every node. Notable examples of such data are the variables used for the purpose of global synchronization. It is to be noted that even though the study in <ref> [21] </ref> was conducted on small scale DSM systems of up to 16 processing nodes, there are many good reasons to believe that this bimodal distribution of invalidation degree remains valid for applications running on larger scale DSM systems.

Reference-contexts: Recent results of related research <ref> [14, 15, 22] </ref> as well as our own simulation experiments have confirmed this claim. However, as the system size grows and the complexity of the applications increases, we also observed that the distribution tends to flatten out slowly. <p> They are listed in Table 2. The first application, Barnes-Hut, was ported to our simulator from the Stanford SPLASH2 benchmark suite <ref> [22] </ref>. For all our experiments we simulated 128 bodies for 4 time steps. We also ported the blocked LU-decomposition kernel from Stanford SPLASH2 benchmark suite. We simulated 128 fi 128 matrices with 8 fi 8 blocks. The third application we chose was All Pairs Shortest Path (APS).
