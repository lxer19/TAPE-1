Abstract: This paper describes JANUS-III, our most recent version of the JANUS speech-to-speech translation system. We present an overview of the system and focus on how system design facilitates speech translation between multiple languages, and allows for easy adaptation to new source and target languages. We also describe our methodology for evaluation of end-to-end system performance with a variety of source and target languages. For system development and evaluation, we have experimented with both push-to-talk as well as cross-talk recording conditions. To date, our system has achieved performance levels of over 80% acceptable translations on transcribed input, and over 70% acceptable translations on speech input recognized with a 75-90% word accuracy. Our current major research is concentrated on enhancing the capabilities of the system to deal with input in broad and general domains.

Reference-contexts: Our JANUS-III recognition system has been applied to various conversational speech tasks, and now achieves Word Error rates below 10% on the Japanese, 23% on the English, 14% on the German <ref> [1] </ref>, and 17% [11, 12] on the Spanish Spontaneous Scheduling Task. On the broad domain telephone quality, spontaneous speech task of the Switchboard corpus, our system performs at a WER of 36% [10]. This is a state-of-the-art performance result which illustrates the difficulty inherent in spontaneous speech tasks. <p> In order to limit this large vocabulary growth, base units other than simple words have been used as new recognition units and for language model training. Our JANUS-III recognizers are based on the Janus Recognition Toolkit (JRTk) <ref> [1] </ref>, a flexible architecture for experimenting with language specific phenomena. The general configuration of our systems uses one or more streams of input features derived from Mel-scale, cepstral or PLP filters processed using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The acoustic units are context dependent, modeled via continuous density HMMs.

Reference-contexts: and for better model ing, we resort to data-driven ways of discovering such variants. * Morpheme Based Language Models For languages characterized by a richer morphology, which make wider use of inflections and compounding (compared to English), more suitable units than the 'word' are used for dictionaries and language models <ref> [3] </ref>. * Phrase Based and Class Based Language Models Words that belong to word classes (such as days of the week), or frequently occurring phrases (e.g., out-of-town, I'm-gonna-be, sometime-in-the-next) are discovered automatically by clustering techniques and added to a dictionary as special words, phrases or mini grammars. 2.1.

Reference-contexts: Target language generation is done using GenKit, a unification-based generation system. With well-developed generation grammars, GenKit results in very accurate translation for well-specified ILTs. We currently support GLR analysis grammars for Spanish and English, and a GenKit generation grammar for English. The JANUS Phoenix translation module <ref> [6] </ref> is an extension of the Phoenix Spoken Language System [8]. It consists of a parsing module and a generation module.

Reference-contexts: The two modules can run separately or can be combined to gain the strengths of both. The GLR module is composed of the GLR* parser [4][5], the LA-Morph morphological analyzer and the GenKit gen erator. The GLR* parser is based on Tomita's General--ized LR parsing algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>. GLR* skips parts of the utterance that it cannot incorporate into a well-formed sentence structure. Thus, it is well-suited to domains in which non-grammaticality is common. The parser conducts a search for the maximal subset of the original input that is covered by the grammar.

Unlike the GLR method which attempts to construct a detailed ILT for a given input utterance, the Phoenix approach attempts to only identify the key semantic concepts represented in the utterance and their underlying structure.
