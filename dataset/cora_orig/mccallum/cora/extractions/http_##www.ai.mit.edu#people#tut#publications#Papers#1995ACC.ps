Abstract: The performance of many spacecraft can be improved by using closed-loop control and commandshaping techniques to reduce problematic vibration. However, due to uncertainties about the operation of controlled structures in zero-gravity, little information exists to give designers confidence in eventual on-orbit performance. The Middeck Active Control Experiment (MACE), scheduled for launch aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavor in March 1995, is designed to investigate these issues by collecting on-orbit data from a controlled flexible structure. In addition to providing a description of the MACE project, this paper presents 0-g predictions for some of the MACE command shaping experiments and describes how the anticipated mission results will be used to understand how to improve the performance of other space systems.

Reference-contexts: From the data collected during these three experiment phases, statements will be made about predictability of high-performance control and command shaping in 0-g and the benefits that can be realized through on-orbit identification and control redesign. A more detailed overview of the MACE project is available in Miller <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.2 MACE hardware description The MACE test article was designed to be representative of a typical precision-controlled, high payload-mass-fraction spacecraft, such as an Earth-observing satellite, with multiple independent scanning or pointing instruments.

Reference-contexts: However, unlike the model of configuration 1, the configuration 2 0-g model was never refined using 1-g testing data. A detailed account of MACE finite-element modeling work can be found in Glaese <ref> [2] </ref>. The second aspect of the MACE modeling effort is the creation of measurement-based models using actual on-orbit data. Since measurement-based models tend to be highly accurate predictors of system behavior, they will be used as a baseline from which to measure the accuracy of the 0-g finite-element models.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the measurement-based system-identification to be performed on MACE employs the Frequency Domain Observability Range Space Extraction (FORSE) technique, as described in Liu <ref> [3] </ref> , to convert frequency-domain data into a statespace system model. During the MACE mission, this algorithm will be applied to on-orbit data to create highly accurate 0-g models which will be used to design some of the controllers and shapers implemented during the flight.

Reference-contexts: Reaching this goal depends not only on accurate 0-g models but also on controlsynthesis techniques that are robust to errors in these models. To address this issue, modern MIMO robust-control algorithms, such as Sensitivity Weighted Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) and Multiple Model (MM) control, as described in How <ref> [4] </ref> and Grocott [5] , will be implemented during the MACE mission.

Reference-contexts: In the past twenty years, researchers have proposed many methods for creating shaped commands to reduce vibration in flexible space structures. Some of the researchers include Farrenkopf <ref> [6] </ref> , who used calculus of variations to generate command profiles designed to minimize vibration in a simple flexible spacecraft model. Addressing a similar problem, Swigert [7] proposed a method for minimizing modal vibration in a flexible satellite system by using shaped torque-commands constructed from finite trigonometric series.
