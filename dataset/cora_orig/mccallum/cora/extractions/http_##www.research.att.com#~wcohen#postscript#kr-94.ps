Abstract: Theoretical and Experimental Results Abstract We present a series of theoretical and experimental results on the learnability of description logics. We first extend previous formal learnability results on simple description logics to C-Classic, a description logic expressive enough to be practically useful. We then experimentally evaluate two extensions of a learning algorithm suggested by the formal analysis. The first extension learns C-Classic descriptions from individuals. (The formal results assume that examples are themselves descriptions.) The second extension learns disjunctions of C-Classic descriptions from individuals. The experiments, which were conducted using several hundred target concepts from a number of domains, indicate that both extensions reli ably learn complex natural concepts.
