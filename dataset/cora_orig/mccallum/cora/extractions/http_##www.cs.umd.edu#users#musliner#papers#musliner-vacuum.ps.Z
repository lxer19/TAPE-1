Title: MICE and the Science of Vacuuming

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and robotics are fields notorious for developing many different systems that are never compared with each other in a quantitative way. This paper suggests that the task of vacuum-cleaning could be used as a benchmark for comparing different robot systems. Such a comparison should take place within a simulation environment, which is outlined in the paper. This paper also suggests a possible standard robot and some benchmark environments, as well as a set of quantitative evaluation metrics that could be used to compare robot systems.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, other subfields of AI, such as planning, have no established sets of tasks with which to compare different systems. Unfortunately, mobile robotics falls in the latter category; rarely are two mobile robot systems tested using the same task, robot, and environment. The recent AAAI robot competitions <ref> [1] </ref> are some of the first instances in which different robots have been tested and compared by placing them in the same domain, with the same goals.

Reference-contexts: With the capabilities of this simulation environment in mind, we can then be concrete in our discussion of a vacuum-cleaning testbed and useful performance metrics. 3 MICE The MICE testbed is a simulation tool originally designed for experimenting with coordination between intelligent systems <ref> [2] </ref>. MICE simulates a two-dimensional grid-world in which agents may move, communicate with each other, and affect their environment. MICE is essentially a discrete-event simulator that helps control the domain and a graphical representation, but provides relatively few constraints on the form of the domain and the agents' abilities.
