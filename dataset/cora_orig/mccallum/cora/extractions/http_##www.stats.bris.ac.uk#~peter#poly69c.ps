Abstract: A method for the Bayesian restoration of noisy binary images portraying an object with constant greylevel on a background is presented. The restoration, performed by fitting a polygon with any number of sides to the object outline, is driven by a new probabilistic model for the generation of polygons in a compact subset of R 2 , which is used as a prior distribution for the polygon. The simulation from the prior and the calculation of the a posteriori mean of greylevels are carried out through reversible jump MCMC computation. Two examples of restoration of synthetic images are presented.

Reference-contexts: Gavin and Jennison's edges lie inside the pixels and are to be joined together to form closed curves, while Helterbrand et al. locate the edges on the pixel themselves and use the classical clique-based Markov random field models for lattices <ref> (see e.g. Besag, 1986) </ref> to put zero probability on non-connected configurations. Finally, Clifford and Nicholls (1994) developed a method for the restoration of polygonal images, based on a model for random polygonal patterns in the plane by Arak et al. (1993) which will be sketched in the next Section. <p> Finally, in Section 4 we describe the result of an experiment into the restoration of two synthetic pictures. A brief discussion concludes the paper. 2 2 The model We will tackle the problem of the restoration of an object via the Bayesian approach <ref> (see e.g. Besag, 1986) </ref> that is classical in statistical image analysis, focussing our attention on the outline of the object only, so that we can also regard our procedure as a binary image restoration. <p> In all cases an Ising model with parameter was used as prior distribution on the true binary greylevel. The three restorations in the top row have been performed using the Gibbs sampler (Geman and Geman, 1984), whereas those in the bottom row are ICM restorations <ref> (Besag, 1986) </ref>. The centre restorations with = 1:2 have the lower error rate, whereas the other two values of are 0.4 and 2.0. The parameter fi in figure 2 has the same relative variation, so the pictures can be compared.

Reference-contexts: A texture image could be dealt with by defining two appropriate Markov random fields <ref> (see e.g. Dubes and Jain, 1989) </ref> for modelling the texture inside and outside the polygon (and conditionally on it), even if it appears to be quite a cumbersome task both in programming and computationally.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A difficult task in the restoration of an image portraying objects is the recovery of their boundaries. This can be done at a low level <ref> (e.g. using an edge detector, see Rosenfeld and Kak, 1982) </ref> or at a high level, trying to embed into the restoration process more complex information regarding the shape of objects, a form of pattern restoration.

Reference-contexts: The sequence fv (n)g is the sequence of polygons v (n) obtained during the simulation, n sweep is the number of sweeps, and n 0 is the length of the burn-in period. The problem we have just stated cannot be solved with ordinary MCMC methods <ref> (e.g. the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, see Tierney, 1994) </ref>, because the chain must visit spaces of different dimension and switch from one to another. The reversible jump algorithm proposed by Green (1995), gives a solution by suitably modifying the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to work in general state spaces. <p> Such a chain is positive recurrent; if it is also Harris recurrent the convergence to equilibrium occurs for all starting points <ref> (see Tierney, 1994, for a proof of these assertions) </ref>.
