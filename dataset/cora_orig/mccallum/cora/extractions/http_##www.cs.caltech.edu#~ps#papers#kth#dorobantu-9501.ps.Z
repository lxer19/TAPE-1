Title: WAVELET REPRESENTATION OF THE POTENTIAL INTEGRAL EQUATIONS

Abstract: In this paper we solve the Laplace equation by solving a boundary integral equation in a wavelet basis. In wavelet basis the discretized equations preserve their good conditioning while their sparse structures speed up iterative solvers. We analyze the behavior of GCR algorithms under wavelet transformations and in non-standard form, the optimal choice of Daubechies filters and truncation strategies.

Reference-contexts: We thus find a parallel between Multipole's compression of computations and the compression of an integral operator in a wavelet basis. This is the effect described by Beylkin, Coifman and Rokhlin in <ref> [1] </ref> in a more general setting, compression of Calderon-Zygmund kernels. One cannot neglect the interactions of different scales. These will be important even at long range and spoil the band structure described above. <p> One cannot neglect the interactions of different scales. These will be important even at long range and spoil the band structure described above. Thus it is important to separate the different scales, which can be done effectively with the non-standard form of the operator introduced in <ref> [1] </ref>. Note that as with most hierarchical methods, such an approach will never find the exact solution. But for any given " &gt; 0, the algorithm commits an error bounded by ". This is no loss, since exact solvers for the discrete (and large) problem are anyhow ruled out. <p> The optimal choice of filters and band-width (which minimize the operation count of a matrix-vector multiplication) is given in Section 4, while some numerical results are given in Section 5. The approach and many of the results are found in the well-known paper <ref> [1] </ref>. A broader view is given in [6]. 2. Definitions and classical results 2.1. BOUNDARY INTEGRAL EQUATIONS Let be a bounded domain in the plane and its boundary. <p> NON-STANDARD FORM OF OPERATORS The non-standard form of an operator is an elegant instrument for decou-pling the different built-in scales. This concept was introduced by Beylkin, Coifman and Rokhlin <ref> [1] </ref> together with the general analysis of the compression of Calderon-Zygmund kernels. 5 Let T be a linear operator on L 2 (I 0 ). <p> This is the non-standard form of the operator T as introduced in <ref> [1] </ref>. The advantage of this form against the wavelet basis representation is that the different scales of the discretized operator T J+1 are decoupled, yielding well-compressed matrices and rapid algorithms. <p> The structure of the discrete operator in the wavelet basis is not as "clean" as the non-standard form. Indeed, it has the famous "finger" 8 structure seen in <ref> [1, 5] </ref> and needs O (N log N ) storage. The computational effort for matrix-vector multiplication is also O (N log N ). It is remarkable that the condition number and number of GCR iterations are almost invariant with respect to the threshold ", as seen in Table 1.

We are interested here in minimizing the work needed to solve the linear system using GCR iterations in non-standard form.

Reference-contexts: The dense matrices obtained with classical discretizations effectively destroy all the savings induced by lowering the dimensions of the problem. A hierarchical approach stands a good chance to lower the computational complexity without loosing the good conditioning of the problem. The Multipole method <ref> [11] </ref> illustrates this approach. It is a fast algorithm for applying the dense matrix of a discretize integral equation to a vector. Its speed comes from dropping the exact arithmetics requirements in favor of a hierarchical aggregation of contributions of neighbors to the computation of an integral.
