Abstract: Existing industrial parts feeders move parts through a sequence of mechanical filters that reject parts in unwanted orientations. These feeders require the design of specialized devices such as ba*es, cutouts, nests, or traps for each part. In this paper we describe a programmable apparatus that uses a vibrating surface for sensorless, non-prehensile manipulation, where parts are systematically positioned and oriented without sensor feedback or force closure. The idea is to generate and change the dynamic modes of a vibrating surface. Depending on the node shapes of the surface, the position and orientation of the parts can be actively controlled. Our research goal is to develop a science base for manipulation using programmable force fields. The vibrating surface creates a two-dimensional force vector field. By chaining together sequences of vector fields, the equilibrium states of a part in the field can be cascaded to obtain a desired final state. We describe efficient polynomial-time algorithms that generate sequences of vector fields for sensorless positioning and orienting of planar parts, and we show that these strategies are complete. Finally we consider parts feeders that can only implement a finite set of vector fields. We show how to plan and execute strategies for these devices, and discuss the tradeoff between mechanical complexity and planning complexity.

Our results on equilibrium analysis, planning and manipulation strategies, and computational complexity devolve to an application of the theory of programmable vector fields developed by Bohringer and Donald <ref> [7] </ref>. This paper applies their algorithmic framework to a new class of vibratory devices. The main characteristics of our device are: * simple design, with no mechanical filters (addressing disadvantages 1 - 3) * programmability (addressing problem 4). <p> Our new algorithms guarantee to position the part uniquely (up to part symmetry) in translation as well as orientation space. Like the algorithms in <ref> [8, 7] </ref>, the new algorithms require no sensing, and work from any initial configuration to uniquely pose the part. In particular, the initial configuration is never known to the (sensorless) execution system, which functions open-loop. <p> The complexity and completeness guarantees we obtain for manipulation grammars are weaker than for the general squeeze field strategies. For squeeze strategies, we apply the algorithmic 5 horizontally by the shaker armature.

This lack of completeness of manipulation grammar strategies stands in contrast to the complete algorithms of <ref> [8, 7] </ref> for which a guaranteed strategy exists for all parts. <p> A (e.g. rectilinear) spiral-shaped part would be an example for such a pathological case, because every bisector intersects O (n) polygon edges. 5.2 Planning of Manipulation Strategies In this section we present an algorithm for sensorless parts alignment with squeeze fields <ref> [8, 7] </ref>. <p> positive moment (t &gt; 0) causes counterclockwise motion, and a negative moment (t &lt; 0) causes clockwise motion until the next root of t is reached. 2 We conclude that any connected polygonal part, when put in a squeeze field, reaches one of a finite number of possible orientation equilibria <ref> [8, 7] </ref>. The motion of the part and, in particular, the mapping between initial orientation and equilibrium orientation is described by the squeeze function, which is derived from the turn function as described in Lemma 7. Note that all squeeze functions derived from turn functions are monotone step-shaped functions. <p> This is not the case for programmable vector fields, where manipulation strategies for non-convex parts are more expensive. As described in <ref> [7] </ref>, there could exist parts that have E = (k n 2 ) orientation equilibria in a squeeze field, which would imply alignment strategies of length (k n 2 ) and planning complexity (k 2 n 4 ). <p> For rectangles with larger edge ratio c (such as R 30 ), an equilibrium exists only at = 0. A similar analysis can be performed for all other placements of the line l, see <ref> [7] </ref> for more details. Equilibrium orientations as determined by our planner are shown in Figure 14 and Table 1. Since all of our parts are symmetric with respect to rotation by , for the remainder of this example we will consider all angles modulo . <p> See Figure 16 for a sample execution of this plan for two arbitrary initial poses. R 30 requires only one squeeze field at an arbitrary angle. It was shown in <ref> [7] </ref> that this algorithm can uniquely orient arbitrary polygons from any initial configuration (up to part symmetry). <p> Based on this property we were able to generate manipulation strategies for unique part alignment. Bohringer and Donald showed in <ref> [7] </ref> that by using a combined radial and squeeze field R + ffiS, the number of equilibria can be reduced to O (k n). <p> Bohringer and Donald propose in <ref> [7] </ref> a combined radial and "gravitational" field R + ffiG which might have this property. ffi is a small positive constant, and G is defined as G (x; y) = (0; 1).

These devices can exploit exotic actuation technologies such as arrayed, mi-crofabricated motion pixels <ref> [8, 43] </ref> or, in the case of this paper, transversely vibrating plates. These new automation designs promise great flexibility, speed, and dexterity | we believe they may be employed to orient, singulate, sort, feed, and assemble parts (see for example Figures 1 and 8). <p> Previous results on array and force field manipulation strategies may be formalized using equilibrium analysis. In <ref> [8] </ref>, Bohringer and Donald proposed a family of control strategies called squeeze patterns and a planning algorithm for parts-orientation. This first result proved an O (n 2 ) upper bound on the number E of orientation equilibria of a non-pathological (see Section 5.1) planar part with n vertices. <p> Finally, our finite manipulation grammar has the following advantage over previous manipulation algorithms for programmable vector fields: previous algorithms such as those described in <ref> [8] </ref> guarantee to uniquely orient a part, but the translational position of the part is unknown at the strategy's termination.

The theory of sensorless manipulation is the science base for developing and controlling such devices. Despite their popularity, all vibratory feeders mentioned so far have some disadvantages: 1.

Reference-contexts: We develop an analysis whereby given the shape of the node, and the part geometry, the final orientation can be predicted. For our device, we further propose a "sensorless" strategy for part manipulation [19], building on the theory originally developed for feeding parts using parallel-jaw grippers <ref> [22] </ref>, which was recently extended to arrays of microactuators and programmable force fields [8, 7]. <p> This is true if and only if t ( + ffi ) 0 and t ( ffi ) 0. 2 Using this lemma we can identify all stable orientations, which allows us to construct the squeeze function <ref> [22] </ref> of P (see Figure 10d), i.e. the mapping from an initial orientation of P to the stable equilibrium orientation that it will reach in the squeeze field: Lemma 7 Let P be a polygonal part on an actuator array A such that assumptions Density and 2Phase hold. <p> The motion of the part and, in particular, the mapping between initial orientation and equilibrium orientation is described by the squeeze function, which is derived from the turn function as described in Lemma 7. Note that all squeeze functions derived from turn functions are monotone step-shaped functions. Goldberg <ref> [22] </ref> has given an algorithm that automatically synthesizes a manipulation strategy to uniquely orient a part, given its squeeze function. While Goldberg's algorithm was designed for squeezes with a robotic parallel-jaw gripper, in fact, it is more general, and can be used for arbitrary monotone step-shaped squeeze functions. <p> This means that the image of its corresponding squeeze function is a set of E discrete values. Given such a squeeze function, Goldberg's algorithm constructs alignment strategies with O (E) steps. Planning complexity is O (E 2 ). 2 Goldberg's strategies <ref> [22] </ref> have the same complexity bounds for convex and non-convex parts, because when using squeeze grasps with a parallel-jaw gripper, only the convex hull of the part need be considered. This is not the case for programmable vector fields, where manipulation strategies for non-convex parts are more expensive. <p> Rotational symmetry in the part also introduces periodicity into these functions. Hence, general squeeze strategies (see Theorem 8) orient a part up to symmetry, that is, up to symmetry in the part and in the squeeze field. Similarly, the grasp plans based on squeeze functions in <ref> [22] </ref> can orient a part with a macroscopic gripper only modulo symmetry in the part and in the gripper. 6 Since we reduce to the squeeze function algorithm in [22], it is not surprising that this phenomenon is also manifested for squeeze vector fields as well. <p> Similarly, the grasp plans based on squeeze functions in <ref> [22] </ref> can orient a part with a macroscopic gripper only modulo symmetry in the part and in the gripper. 6 Since we reduce to the squeeze function algorithm in [22], it is not surprising that this phenomenon is also manifested for squeeze vector fields as well.

Finally, the squeeze function is used as input for Goldberg's planning algorithm <ref> [22] </ref>, which returns as output a sequence of squeeze angles. A sequence of two squeeze fields, with a relative angle of =2, is sufficient to uniquely orient both R 10 and R 20 . See Figure 16 for a sample execution of this plan for two arbitrary initial poses. <p> Hence if assumption 2Phase is relaxed, this idea still enables us to simplify the general motion planning problem (as formulated e.g. by Lozano-Perez, Mason, and Taylor in [28]) to that of Erdmann and Mason [19].
