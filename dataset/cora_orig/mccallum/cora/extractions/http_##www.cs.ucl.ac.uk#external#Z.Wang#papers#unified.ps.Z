Title: A Unified Framework for Multicast Forwarding  
Author: Zheng Wang and Jon Crowcroft 
Address: Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department, University College London  
Abstract: This paper examines the issues of implementation and integration in multicast. A framework for multicast forwarding is presented, which separates multicast forwarding from any associated protocols that may affect the forwarding decisions, such as multicast routing, resource management and host membership protocols. This framework allows seamless integration of various associated protocols and provides a unified interface for new development.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multicast provides an important service that has been extensively used by multimedia applications such as video and audio conferencing. The experiments over the MBONE <ref> [1] </ref>, an Internet-wide experimental multicast testbed, have demonstrated the enormous potential of multicast, and also provide us directions of further enhancing this service.

Reference-contexts: To support multimedia applications such as video and audio conferencing, the routers must have the following essential components: Amulticast routing protocol (MRP) for constructing and maintaining the multicast trees. The multicast routing protocol running over MBONE now is a version of DVMRP <ref> [2] </ref>, based on the truncated-broadcast algorithm [3]. A number of proposals have been put forward to improve the scaling of multicast routing. CBT [4] proposes a core-based tree to replace multiple sender-based trees.

A number of proposals have been put forward to improve the scaling of multicast routing. CBT [4] proposes a core-based tree to replace multiple sender-based trees. <p> It provides a unified interface for new development. It allows the co-existence of multiple multicast routing and resource man agement protocols. It eliminates forwarding decision making on a per-packet basis, thus speeds up packet forwarding. 2 Basic Approach In the implementation of DVMRP based on <ref> [3] </ref>, the forwarding of multicast packets is oriented around each network interface's structure (vif). There is not a clear boundary between the multicast routing and forwarding; they are integrated in one piece. <p> The In-Branch is a pointer to the interface from which the multicast packet of that tree should be received. It is necessary because in multicast protocols based on reverse-path forwarding, such as DVMRP <ref> [3] </ref>, a router has to check the in-coming packets to detect the last hop of the reverse path.

Reference-contexts: Such a design makes it difficult to integrate other multicast routing protocols within the same structure. In unicast routing, there is a clear separation between routing and forwarding, which is regarded by some people as one of the fundamental design decisions leading to the success of the Internet <ref> [12] </ref>. In the BSD UNIX design, the routing algorithm exchanges information among nodes and produces a forwarding table. The router simply forwards packets to the next hop specified in the forwarding table. This separation has several advantages.
