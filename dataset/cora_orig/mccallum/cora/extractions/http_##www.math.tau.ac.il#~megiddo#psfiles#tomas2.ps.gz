Title: A Sublinear Parallel Algorithm for Stable Matching  
Author: Tomas Feder Nimrod Megiddo Serge A. Plotkin 
Note: the total length of preference lists of individuals.  
Abstract: Parallel algorithms for various versions of the stable matching problem are presented. The algorithms are based on the primal-dual interior path-following method for linear programming. The main result is that a stable matching can be found in O fl ( p m) time by a polynomial number of processors, where m is

An interesting question is the existence of sublinear parallel algorithms with a polynomial number of processors. <p> The approach is by means of interior point methods in linear programming. In Sections 2 and 3 we introduce networks of gates and the concepts of nonexpansive and convergent networks. The material in these sections is from Feder <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> .

The system A has a solution. Proof: The nonexpansive mapping f can be extended into a continuous nonexpansive mapping ~ f on the full hypercube <ref> [0; 1] </ref> m , by defining ~ f (x) = a i2I (f) where the sum ranges over all f0; 1g-configurations a, and w (x; a; i) = x i if a i = 1 1 x i otherwise . <p> Thus, if f is the transition function of a network N , then f S can be defined as the gate to which the network N converges. The following is from Feder <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: It is observed in Goldberg, Plotkin, Shmoys, and Tardos <ref> [ 2 ] </ref> that one iteration of the interior point algorithm can be performed in O (log 2 N ) time in the concurrent-read concurrent-write (CRCW) PRAM model with N 3 processors. Thus, we have the following: Theorem 4.7.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is based on formulating the problems as linear programming problems and solving them with the primal-dual interior path-following method. As an application, the problem of stable matching <ref> [ 3 ] </ref> can be solved in O fl ( p m) time, where m is the total length of the preference lists of individuals. The approach is by means of interior point methods in linear programming.
