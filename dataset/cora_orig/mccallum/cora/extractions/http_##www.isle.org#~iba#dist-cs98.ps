Abstract: In this paper we examine the behavior of a human-computer system for crisis response. As one instance of crisis management, we describe the task of responding to spills and fires involving hazardous materials. We then describe INCA, an intelligent assistant for planning and scheduling in this domain, and its relation to human users. We focus on INCA's strategy of retrieving a case from a case library, seeding the initial schedule, and then helping the user adapt this seed. We also present three hypotheses about the behavior of this mixed-initiative system and some experiments designed to test them. The results suggest that our approach leads to faster response development than user-generated or automatically-generated schedules but without sacrificing solution quality.

Reference-contexts: Related Work While early approaches to crisis response planning were predominantly autonomous in nature, more recent systems provide interactive modes that, like INCA, let humans directly control the plan development process (e.g., OPLAN-2 (Tate, Drabble, & Kirby, 1994) and SOCAP <ref> (Bienkowski, 1996) </ref>). Unlike INCA, however, these systems aid users in developing solutions from scratch rather than help them in adapting solutions from previous cases. CLAVIER (Hinkle & Toomey, 1994), a case-based system for autoclave loading, is an early example of a system that interactively adapts previous solutions.

Reference-contexts: In the following pages, we describe a prototype intelligent assistant for crisis response. In particular, we examine the task of responding to chemical spills and fires, which we describe in the following section. Crises exhibit three primary themes: threat, urgency, and uncertainty <ref> (Gervasio & Iba, 1997) </ref>. In this paper, we are primarily interested in the element of urgency and the impact that a computational assistant can have on the effectiveness and timeliness of a response.

Reference-contexts: Like INCA, these systems also use a case-seeding mechanism to initialize the development of a response. INCA differs in that it is an adaptive user interface (Langley, 1997) that can acquire user models to alter its behavior to provide personalized assistance <ref> (Gervasio, Iba, & Langley, 1998) </ref>. This paper also focused on an explicit evaluation of the benefits of case seeding in a mixed-initiative setting. DIAL (Leake, 1995) is a case-based disaster response planner that can also learn from user interaction.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the same theoretical approachdescription in terms of computational processesand the same experimental methodstudying the effect of processes on measures of performanceapplies equally to such hybrid entities. Such research has been most prevalent in the area of intelligent tutoring systems <ref> (Sleeman & Brown, 1982) </ref>, but it seems equally applicable to the study of human interaction with intelligent assistants. In the following pages, we describe a prototype intelligent assistant for crisis response.

Reference-contexts: INCA differs in that it is an adaptive user interface (Langley, 1997) that can acquire user models to alter its behavior to provide personalized assistance (Gervasio, Iba, & Langley, 1998). This paper also focused on an explicit evaluation of the benefits of case seeding in a mixed-initiative setting.

Reference-contexts: Thus, DIAL serves as a learning apprentice while INCA is more of an adaptive assistant. CABINS <ref> (Miyashita & Sycara, 1995) </ref> is an interactive case-based assistant for job-shop scheduling that, like INCA, learns user preferences for the purpose of tailoring its behavior to individual users.

Reference-contexts: In the context of case-based systems for crises, JMCAP (desJardins, Francis, & Wolverton, 1998) uses a hybrid planner for the development of maritime evacuation operations, and CHARADE <ref> (Perini & Ricci, 1995) </ref> determines initial intervention plans to control forest fires. Like INCA, these systems also use a case-seeding mechanism to initialize the development of a response.

Reference-contexts: Addressing these issues is one part of our future work. Related Work While early approaches to crisis response planning were predominantly autonomous in nature, more recent systems provide interactive modes that, like INCA, let humans directly control the plan development process (e.g., OPLAN-2 <ref> (Tate, Drabble, & Kirby, 1994) </ref> and SOCAP (Bienkowski, 1996)).
