Reference-contexts: Reduced coordinate formulations involve re-parameterizing an unconstrained system with n degrees of freedom as a constrained system with i &lt; n degrees of freedom. This can be quite difficult for arbitrary system of constraints, since there is often no obvious way of re-parameterizing systems involving constraint loops <ref> [5, 3] </ref>. A more flexible technique is to use Lagrange multiplier dynamic constraints. Lagrange multiplier approaches maintain constraints by introducing constraint forces into the original n degrees of freedom system. <p> Very often A is sparse, in which case conjugate gradient (or other iterative convergence) methods exploiting sparseness may be used. In theory such techniques reduce the order to approximately O (n 2 ) <ref> [8, 3] </ref>, but since the sparseness of A is not guaranteed solving for is generally a O (n 3 ) operation [3].

Central to this technique is an always sparse formulation, and a relatively simple O (n) technique for solving the resulting linear system. <p> In theory such techniques reduce the order to approximately O (n 2 ) [8, 3], but since the sparseness of A is not guaranteed solving for is generally a O (n 3 ) operation <ref> [3] </ref>.
