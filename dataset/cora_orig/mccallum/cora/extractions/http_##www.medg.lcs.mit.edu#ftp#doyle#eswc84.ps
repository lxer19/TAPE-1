Abstract: Knowledge engineers qualified to build expert systems are currently in short supply. We propose that production of useful and trustworthy expert systems can be significantly increased by pursuing the idea of articulate apprenticeship independent of computer implementations. Making theoretical progress in artificial intelligence should also help. I thank Jaime Carbonell, John McDermott, Joseph Schatz, and Derek Sleeman for helpful discussions and comments.
