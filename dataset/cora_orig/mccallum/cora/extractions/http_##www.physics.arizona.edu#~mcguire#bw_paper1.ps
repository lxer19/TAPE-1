Abstract: An algorithm for synaptic modification (plasticity) is described by which a recurrently connected network of neuron-like units can organize itself to produce a sequence of activation states that does not repeat itself for a very long time. During the self-organization stage, the connections between the units undergo non-Hebbian modifications, which tend to decorrelate the activity of the units, thereby lengthening the period of the cyclic modes inherent in the network. It is shown that the periodicity of the activity rises exponentially with the amount of exposure to this plasticity algorithm. Threshold is also a critical parameter in determining cycle lengths, as is the rate of decay of the fields that accumulate at silent units.

Reference-contexts: Introduction There are several potentially useful features in a randomly connected asymmetric network of quasi-neural elements <ref> [1] </ref> which acquires non-simple behavior of long cyclic modes. For example, the network explores many states and hence many associations without becoming trapped in a static state. <p> The same result is seen for longer cycles and more brainwashing (Figures 8-9). Another interesting change is the reduction of 2 to a value O (2-3), which suggests that the Gaussian component in the correlation dominates the distribution. Conclusions The brainwashing algorithm was designed <ref> [1] </ref> to discourage steady states and short cycles, and to decorrelate the firing activity of the units in a recurrent network.

Reference-contexts: It is not the aim of this paper to describe the applications of the system, but to develop a robust unsupervised learning procedure which produces networks with nearly chaotic behavior <ref> [2] </ref>.
