Abstract: Why does fractal image compression work? What properties must an image have for fractal block coders to work well? What is the implicit image model underlying fractal image compression? The behavior of fractal block coders is clear for deterministically self-similar structures. In this paper we examine the behavior of these coders on statistically self-similar structures. Specifically, we examine their behavior for fractional Brownian motion, a simple texture model. Our analysis suggests that the properties necessary for fractal block coders to work well are not so dissimilar from those required by DCT and wavelet transform based coders. Fractal block coders work well for images consisting of ensembles of locally self-similar regions together with locally stationary regions with decaying power spectra, local statistical similarity, and local isotropy. Our analysis motivates a generalization of fractal block coders that leads to substantial improvements in coding performance and also illuminates some of the fundamental limitations of current fractal compression schemes.

Reference-contexts: Our analysis does suggest ways in which the performance of fractal block coders can be greatly improved with little additional complexity. Our analysis relies on a new wavelet-based analytical framework for block-based fractal compression schemes first introduced in <ref> [2] </ref>. Within this framework we are able to draw upon insights from the well-established transform coder paradigm in order to address the issue of why fractal block coders work. The balance of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of a basic fractal block coding scheme. <p> as the subtree with roots given by J !;k;l , and we refer to this J k;l as the scaling function associated with the subtree. 3.2 A Wavelet Transform Domain Analog of Fractal Block Coding We now describe a wavelet transform domain analog of fractal block coding first introduced in <ref> [2] </ref>. Related schemes have been described independently in [13] and [19]. The wavelet-based fractal coder of [15] is similar in spirit but differs fundamentally in its goals and implementation.

Reference-contexts: A variety of domain pools are used in the literature. Here we will focus on a disjoint tiling of I, the disjoint domain pool, D = f (2 D m; 2 D n)j0 m; n &lt; 2 ND g. For discussion of more general domain pools, see <ref> [3] </ref>. Two basic operators are used for codebook construction. The "average-and-subsample" operator A maps a 2 J fi2 J image block to a 2 J1 fi2 J1 block by averaging each pixel in B J with its neighbors and then subsampling. <p> Although the bound is a weak one, small errors jjEjj are found in practice to yield small reconstruction errors jjI fp Ijj. Extensions of the collage theorem bound and a more detailed discussion of reconstruction errors may be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3 A Wavelet Framework 3.1 Notation The wavelet transform is a natural tool for analyzing fractal block coders since wavelet bases possess the same type of dyadic self-similarity that fractal coders seek to exploit. <p> The reason is that translation of domain blocks by distances smaller than 2 D leads to non-integral translates of the wavelets in their corresponding subtrees. This issue is addressed in more detail in <ref> [3] </ref>. 4 Fractal Block Coding of Textures In section 2 we motivated the codebook used by fractal block coders by emphasizing the scale-invariance (covariance) of isolated straight edges, constant regions, and constant gradients. More complex image structures lack this deterministic self-similarity, however. <p> Our texture model therefore motivates the use of bases with additional vanishing moments. Although our development in 3 focused on the Haar basis, there is no reason we cannot replace this basis with a different symmetric, biorthogonal wavelet basis. Indeed, numerical experiments in <ref> [3] </ref> show dramatic improvements in coder performance when using wavelets with higher numbers of vanishing moments than the Haar basis. An important observation is that quantization in our texture model entails matching pairs of random vectors. <p> A comparison with the results of [8] suggests that codewords for our fractal block scheme will be unnecessarily densely distributed in high probability regions of the space of subtrees and too sparsely distributed in low probability regions. This conjecture is borne out in our numerical experiments, described in <ref> [3] </ref> in which a tight clustering of codewords is found around the all-zero subtree, leading to an inefficient codebook.

Reference-contexts: A key property of fBm processes is that their measured power spectra decay as j!j fl , where fl = 2H + 1. Natural images observe a similar power-law spectral decay. Measurements of spectral decay in natural images show decay rates between ! 2 and ! 3 . Field <ref> [4] </ref> hypothesizes that image contrast is roughly invariant across scale, which implies that image luminance power spectra decay like ! 2 . His measurements of the spectra of 85 photographs of natural scenes show an overall decay rate of roughly ! 2:2 .

Reference-contexts: Voss [21] claims that shapes with fractal dimension of 0.2 to 0.3 greater than their Euclidean dimension are particularly common in nature; fractional Brownian motions exhibiting such Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimensions possess spectral decay rates of ! 2:4 to ! 2:35 , respectively. Flandrin <ref> [7] </ref> has shown that the wavelet transform coefficients of a fractional Brownian motion process are stationary sequences with a self-similar covariance structure. This means that the codebook constructed from domain subtrees will possess the same statistics as the set of range subtrees. <p> When the decay is O (! fi ) for 2 &lt; fi &lt; 3, the autocorrelation function for a coefficient lag of n decays as jnj fi3 for n large <ref> [7] </ref>. Tewfik and Kim [18] have shown that for such fBm's, wavelet transforms for bases with 2 or more vanishing moments yield much better approximations to the K-L transform than does the Haar basis. Our texture model therefore motivates the use of bases with additional vanishing moments.

Reference-contexts: An important observation is that quantization in our texture model entails matching pairs of random vectors. Although the clustering of subtrees makes reasonably accurate quantization of high dimensional subtrees possible, the codebook vectors are unlikely to be distributed in an optimal fashion. Analysis by Gersho <ref> [8] </ref> of asymptotic high resolution vector quantization with an entropy constraint reveals that for high dimensional VQ's the optimal quantizer is very close to a uniform quantizer. The codebook generated by fractal block coders for fractional Brownian motion textured regions is far from uniform. <p> On the contrary, code vectors are tightly clustered around the origin. Although having a free gain parameter leaves open the possibility of spreading the codebook out, the restrictions on the gain parameter imposed by convergence requirements for general domain pools limit its effect. A comparison with the results of <ref> [8] </ref> suggests that codewords for our fractal block scheme will be unnecessarily densely distributed in high probability regions of the space of subtrees and too sparsely distributed in low probability regions.

Reference-contexts: A second operator is the symmetry operator L k , 1 k 8, which maps a square block to one of the 8 isometries obtained from compositions of reflections and 90 degree rotations. Range block approximation is similar to shape-gain vector quantization <ref> [9] </ref>. Range blocks are quantized to a linear combination of an element from the codebook and a constant block.

Reference-contexts: Fractal image compression, introduced by Barnsley and Jacquin [1][10], is based on very different principles. Fractal block coders, as described by Jacquin, assume that "image redundancy can be efficiently exploited through self-transformability on a blockwise basis" <ref> [11] </ref>. They store images as contraction maps of which the images are approximate fixed points. Images are decoded via iterative application of these maps. In this paper we examine the behavior of fractal block coders for textured regions, as modeled by fractal Brownian motion processes. <p> For fractal block coders to be effective, images must be composed of features at fine scales that are also present at coarser scales up to a rigid motion and an affine transform of intensities. This is the "self-transformability" assumption described by <ref> [11] </ref>. It is clear that this assumption holds for images composed of isolated straight lines and constant regions, since these features are self-similar. That it should hold when more complex features are present is much less obvious.

Reference-contexts: Because of the physical structure underlying natural images, pixel values are far from independent, especially for pixels that are close together. The continuity of the physical objects that give rise to natural images produces a local pixel covariance structure with correlations that decrease with pixel separation. Pentland <ref> [14] </ref> proposes a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) texture model that mimics this type of covariance structure. Fractional Brownian motion models have proved quite successful for generating synthetic landscapes and clouds in computer graphics applications [21] which lends additional support to using fBm as a model for complex image structures.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, recent wavelet transform based techniques that have achieved particularly good compression results have done so by augmenting scalar quantization of transform coefficients with a zerotree vector that is used to efficiently encode locally constant regions <ref> [16] </ref>. For fractal block coders to be effective, images must be composed of features at fine scales that are also present at coarser scales up to a rigid motion and an affine transform of intensities. This is the "self-transformability" assumption described by [11].

Reference-contexts: A second way, then, in which fractal block coders can be improved is by modifying the codebook to eliminate codeword duplication arising from the overly dense clustering of codewords around all-zero subtrees. Signes <ref> [17] </ref> has suggested optimizing fractal codebooks by pruning them before quantizing.

Reference-contexts: The answer lies in the fact that the Haar transform acts as an approximate Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) transform for ordinary Brownian motion, concentrating the energy in the coarse-scale coefficients. One can show that the variances of the Haar wavelet coefficients decay in scale as 2 2j <ref> [22] </ref>. The result is that for Brownian motion processes, the Haar subtrees are clustered around the low-dimensional subspace consisting of subtrees with all-zero fine-scale coefficients.
