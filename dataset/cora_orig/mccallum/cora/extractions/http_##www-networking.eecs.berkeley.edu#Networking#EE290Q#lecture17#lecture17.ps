Abstract: In today's lecture we continue our study of call blocking in large circuit switched networks, and begin to discuss how this analysis can be applied to the development of optimal routing schemes for such networks. So the lecture is divided into two sections: 1 We finish the discussion of approximating call blocking probabilities using the Erlang Fixed Point Approximation and the Fluid Flow Approximation (please refer to the preceeding two lectures for the entire development). Last time, we analyzed the EFP to gain insight into the accuracy of its approximation and when it is appropriate to use EFP. We found that as the scale of the network becomes large (in other words, as the link capacity and the offered traffic increase simultaneously) the loss probabilities are as if each link blocks independently, and we may use the Erlang Fixed Point for an accurate approximation of actual call blocking probabilities. In today's lecture we introduce the Fluid Flow Approximation, also valid for large scale networks, which allows us to characterize the previously introduced, discrete-arrival, stochastic network model with a continuous-flow, deterministic model that is much easier to analyze. We show how Erlang's formula for individual link blocking probabilities can be used to improve the accuracy of the Fluid Flow Approximation, and we compare the Erlang Fixed Point and Fluid Flow models as network scale becomes large. This material is based on first Kelly paper. [1] 2 Now that we have an understanding of call blocking probabilities in an arbitrary, large, circuit switched network, we move on to discussion of how we might use this information to devise optimal routing schemes for the network. We begin by outlining a basic routing model, with a few assumptions about the routing disciplines and the optimization criteria, and we formulate a global optimization problem. The analysis of this problem is begun today, to be continued in subsequent lectures. This material is based on the second Kelly paper. [2]
