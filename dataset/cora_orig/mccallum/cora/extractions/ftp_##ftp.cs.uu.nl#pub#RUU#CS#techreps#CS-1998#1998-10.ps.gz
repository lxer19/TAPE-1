Abstract: By subjecting a Bayesian belief network to a sensitivity analysis with respect to its conditional probabilities, the reliability of its output can be evaluated. Unfortunately, straightforward sensitivity analysis of a belief network is highly time-consuming, as a result of the usually large number of probabilities to be investigated. In this paper, we show that the graphical independence structure of a Bayesian belief network induces various properties that allow for reducing the computational burden of a sensitivity analysis. We show that several analyses can be identified as being uninformative because the conditional probabilities under study cannot affect the network's output. In addition, we show that the analyses that are informative comply with simple mathematical functions. By exploiting these properties, the practicability of sensitivity analysis of Bayesian belief networks is enhanced considerably.

Reference-contexts: A non-ancestor without any observed descendants, to conclude, cannot exert nor pass on any diagnostic influence on the probability of interest.

We illustrate the concept of sensitivity set and its use by means of an example. <p> Also, analyses with respect to conditional probabilities that are incompatible with any of the observations can be excluded as being uninformative. In recent experiments on randomly generated belief networks, we have found that excluding the indicated analyses may lead to a considerable reduction of the computational burden involved <ref> (Coupe and Van der Gaag, 1998) </ref>. 4 INFORMATIVE ANALYSES In the previous section, we have shown that the graphical structure of a Bayesian belief network induces algebraic independence of the probability of interest with regard to several of the network's conditional probabilities. <p> In addition, it will be evident that the constants a, b, c, and d in the quotient stated above are built from the network's conditional probabilities. For a more detailed proof, we refer the reader to our extended technical paper <ref> (Coupe and Van der Gaag, 1998) </ref>. 2 The mathematical function stated in the previous proposition reduces to a linear function for a conditional probability that pertains to a node from the sensitivity set under study that does not have any observed descendants. <p> From this property, we have that the probability Pr (o) is algebraically independent of the conditional probability x under study. We conclude that Pr (o) is a constant with respect to x. The reader is referred once more to our extended paper for a detailed proof <ref> (Coupe and Van der Gaag, 1998) </ref>. 2 Note that from the previous proposition we have that, if no observations are available, a belief network's probability of interest relates linearly to the conditional probabilities of all nodes in a sensitivity set under study. <p> Such an analysis serves to reveal how two conditional probabilities under study interact to affect the probability of interest. The results that we have presented in this paper are easily generalised to a two-way sensitivity analysis of a Bayesian belief network <ref> (Coupe and Van der Gaag, 1998) </ref>. In the near future, we envision further investigation of the properties of sensitivity analysis of Bayesian belief networks, both from a theoretical and an experimental point of view.

Reference-contexts: To be of practical use, therefore, more efficient methods for sensitivity analysis of Bayesian belief networks should be found. In earlier work on sensitivity analysis of Bayesian belief networks, K. Blackmond Laskey has introduced an efficient method for computing sensitivity values from a belief network <ref> (Laskey, 1995) </ref>. A sensitivity value is the partial derivative of the network's probability of interest with respect to a conditional probability under study: it is a first-order approximation of the effect of deviation from this probability's assessment.

Reference-contexts: A Bayesian belief network basically is a concise representation of a joint probability distribution on a set of statistical variables. It encodes, in a graphical structure, the variables under study, along with their independences; the dependences among the variables are captured by conditional probabilities <ref> (Pearl, 1988) </ref>. The conditional probabilities of a Bayesian belief network are generally assessed from statistical data or by human experts. As a result of incompleteness of data and partial knowledge of the problem domain being modelled, the assessments obtained are inevitably inaccurate. <p> We define the semantics of a Bayesian belief network more formally <ref> (Pearl, 1988) </ref>. In doing so, we assign a probabilistic meaning to a network's digraph. Definition 2.1 Let G = (V (G); A (G)) be an acyclic digraph and let t be a trail in G between the nodes V i and V j .
