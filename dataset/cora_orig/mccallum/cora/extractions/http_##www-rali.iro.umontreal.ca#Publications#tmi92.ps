Title: Where the Tagger Falters

Abstract: Statistical n-gram taggers like that of [Church 1988] or [Foster 1991] assign a part-of-speech label to each word in a text on the basis of probability estimates that are automatically derived from a large, already tagged training corpus. This paper examines the grammatical constructions which cause such taggers to falter most frequently. As one would expect, certain of these errors are due to linguistic dependencies that extend beyond the limited scope of statistical taggers, while others can be seen to derive from the composition of the tag set; many can only be corrected through a full syntactic or semantic analysis of the sentence. The paper goes on to consider two very different approaches to the problem of automatically detecting tagging errors. The first uses statistical information that is already at the taggers disposal; the second attempts to isolate error-prone contexts by formulating linguistic diagnostics in terms of regular expressions over tag sequences. In a small experiment focussing on the preterite/past participle ambiguity, the linguistic technique turns out to be more efficient, while the statistical technique is more effective.
