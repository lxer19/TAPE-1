Abstract: We study the utility of buffer at switches in increasing the achievable utilization of a network providing deterministic guarantee. To determine the increase in utilization, we classify packet scheduling algorithms into two classes. Only one of these classes can utilize additional buffers to increase the achievable utilization. We experimentally determine the difference in achievable utilization of these classes. Our experiments demonstrate that contrary to intuition, in most cases, additional buffers do not lead to higher achievable utilization of a network.

Reference-contexts: as: j j j n=K X ff n where A (p j f ) is the time at which packet p j f is gener ated at the source. * Rate Controlled Service Disciplines: The class of Rate Controlled Service Disciplines (RCSD) is defined based on the concept of shapers <ref> [3] </ref>. A shaper is a network element that ensures that its output traffic satisfies some burstiness constraints. <p> RCSD class contains work conserving as well as nonwork conserving algorithms (see <ref> [3, 16] </ref> for some examples). <p> RCSD class contains work conserving as well as nonwork conserving algorithms (see [3, 16] for some examples). It has been shown in <ref> [3] </ref> that if each of the server on the path of a flow employs a scheduling algorithm in RCSD, then the network guarantees that the maximum end-to-end delay of any packet, denoted by d f , is given as: d f = D f + n=1 f (3) where D S <p> Intuitively, S f is a shaper com posed by sequentially connecting shapers S 1 f ; ::; S K (see <ref> [3] </ref> for a precise definition of composition of shapers). <p> Consider two flows f and m that conform to leaky bucket with parameters (10pkt; 1pkt=s) and (1pkt; 1pkt=s), respectively. Let both flows f and m require delay of 5:5s and be served by a single server with capacity 2pkts=s. Then, from the results in <ref> [3] </ref>, it can be shown that a RCSD server satisfies the deadline requirements of both the flows. <p> Hence, if Q flows are served by a server, then the schedulability condition is P i=Q * RCSD: We use the schedulability condition presented in [2], which is a generalization of Theorem 1 of <ref> [3] </ref> for networks that have variable packet sizes, to determine the schedulability region. <p> If all the flows have the same packet length l, then we use Theorem 1 of <ref> [3] </ref> and ensure that the following set of inequalities hold: minf (k + 1)l; Qlg + i=k X ( i l) i=k1 X r i + i=1 To experimentally evaluate the difference in achievable utilization between RCSD and GR networks, we first assume that there are only two types of flow <p> The ranges that we choose are: [b min ; b max ] = [1; 20], [l min ; l max ] = [512; 8196] bits, [r min ; r max ] = [32; 2056] Kb/s, and [k min ; k max ] = <ref> [3; 15] </ref>. The six different ranges that we choose for delay are: [25; 200] ms, [100; 200] ms, [100; 300] ms, [100; 400] ms, [100; 500] ms, and [100; 600] ms.

Reference-contexts: Scheduling algorithm at server i belongs to GR if it guarantees that packet p j f will be transmitted by EAT i (p f ) + ff i f where ff i f depends on the scheduling algorithm as well as the server and the flow characteristics <ref> [6] </ref>. Several algorithms such as Virtual Clock [15, 18], Weighted Fair Queuing [1], Start-time Fair Queuing [8], Self Clocked Fair Queuing [4], Leap-forward Virtual Clock [14], Frame-based Fair Queuing [13], Delay EDD [7, 17] belong to the GR class. It has been shown in [6] that if each of the server <p> the server and the flow characteristics <ref> [6] </ref>. Several algorithms such as Virtual Clock [15, 18], Weighted Fair Queuing [1], Start-time Fair Queuing [8], Self Clocked Fair Queuing [4], Leap-forward Virtual Clock [14], Frame-based Fair Queuing [13], Delay EDD [7, 17] belong to the GR class. It has been shown in [6] that if each of the server on the path of a flow employs a scheduling algorithm in GR, then the end-to-end delay of packet p j f is given as: j j j n=K X ff n where A (p j f ) is the time at which packet p <p> Then, since flow f conforms to the shape enforced by the shaper S f , D S f = 0. However, since D C f is given as (k1)l f <ref> [6] </ref>, if k &gt; 1, D C f &gt; 0. Hence, b d f may be greater than d f . Thus in case of RCSD, the end-to-end delay may increase due to the presence of the shaper. <p> for scheduling algorithms in GR, let ff i f = R f + max C i where C i is the capacity of server i and l i max is the maximum length of packets served by server i (scheduling algorithms such as WFQ and Virtual Clock satisfy this assumption <ref> [6] </ref>). Since EDF has the largest schedulability region, let the RCSD scheduling algorithms employ EDF scheduler and a ( f ; r f ) leaky bucket shaper for flow f . Consider two flows f and m that conform to leaky bucket with parameters (10pkt; 1pkt=s) and (1pkt; 1pkt=s), respectively. <p> Then, from the results in [3], it can be shown that a RCSD server satisfies the deadline requirements of both the flows. On the other hand, in case of GR, from (2) and <ref> [6] </ref> we know that flow f would have to reserve at least rate R f such that: f l f + R f l max = 5:5 (8) Hence, 10 R f + 0:5 = 5:5 which yields R f = 2pkt=s, which is the capacity of the server. <p> Thus, intuitively, for a given end-to-end delay, the resource requirement at each server for a flow increases linearly with the number of servers on the path. On the other hand, in a network of GR servers, we know from (2) and <ref> [6] </ref> that the reserved rate R f r f should be such that: d f R f l f + i=1 max Then, if f is large, i.e., when RCSD servers may be expected to have larger utilization, R f increases sub-linearly with the number of servers on the path.

Reference-contexts: Our experiments demonstrated that contrary to intuition, in most cases, additional buffers in a network of RCSD servers do not lead to higher achievable utilization. This experimental result indicates that if a source desires deterministic bounds on packet delay, then the traffic should be completely smoothed at the source <ref> [9] </ref>. Though our experiments explored large parameter space (more than 100,000 schedulability regions and 700,000 sets of flows were generated), they are not exhaustive. Hence, they should be considered as the first step in evaluating effectiveness of buffer in increasing achievable utilization of networks providing deterministic guarantees.
