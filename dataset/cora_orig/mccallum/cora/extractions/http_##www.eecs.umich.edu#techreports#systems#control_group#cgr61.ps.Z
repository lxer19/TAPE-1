Reference-contexts: 1 . Introduction The flow control problem addressed in this paper arises in the performance modeling of the `hop-by-hop' layer of computer communication networks. The hop-by-hop scheme considered here is the same as the one in <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. Its purpose is to maintain a smooth flow of traffic between M transmitting stations sending packets to a single receiver over a communication channel. The channel is assumed to be slotted, that is, the channel time is divided into equal segments called slots. <p> Our cost per phase is the expectation of a linear combination of the number of untransmitted packets at the respective stations. A policy for the receiver is any function of the abovementioned information that allocates the slots ( T ) among the stations at each phase. In <ref> [2] </ref> and [3], we investigated discounted and time-average optimal policies when the holding costs are equal at all transmitters. Here, we turn our attention to the general case when the holding costs are not necessarily identical. <p> Since we relax the hypothesis that the holding costs are equal, the properties of optimal policies and their implications are weaker than those in <ref> [2] </ref>. When M = 2, we find that the addition of one packet at a transmitter either leaves the allocation of slots unchanged, or increases the allocation by unity in favor of that transmitter. <p> problem, the objective is to minimize over the window vectors w i 2 A; 1 i N , the expected total fi-discounted cost J N (x) = i=1 M X c (j) E [(X i + Y i1 w i ) + j X 1 = x]: (2:5) As in <ref> [2] </ref>, we model this problem as a Markov decision process and derive the optimality equations of dynamic programming. <p> We only show that V (x) is finite and refer the reader to <ref> [2] </ref> for the proof that it exists and that it is the minimal total expected discounted infinite horizon cost. <p> Proof: By the ordering (2.4) of the c (j) 's, V 1 (; x) c (1) W 1 (; x), where W 1 (; x) is the total expected fi-discounted cost when the holding costs at all transmitters are equal to 1. Since by Lemma 2.2 of <ref> [2] </ref>, W 1 (; x) M (fi; x), the proof is complete. The optimality equation of dynamic programming for the infinite horizon problem is given by (see [2]) V (x) = min fL (x; w) + fiE [V ([Y + x w] + )]g: (2:14) The result V (x) = lim <p> Since by Lemma 2.2 of <ref> [2] </ref>, W 1 (; x) M (fi; x), the proof is complete. The optimality equation of dynamic programming for the infinite horizon problem is given by (see [2]) V (x) = min fL (x; w) + fiE [V ([Y + x w] + )]g: (2:14) The result V (x) = lim N!1 V N (x) will enable us to derive the qualitative prop-erties of optimal allocation policies for the infinite horizon problem by a standard limiting argument. <p> We remark that for the case of equal holding costs, the analogous of property (P2) is the stronger result : w (j) fl x (j) for each j, see Lemma 3.6 of <ref> [2] </ref>. As a consequence of properties (P1) and (P2), we transform this optimal re source allocation problem into an equivalent one with a smaller action space. This then reduces the computational complexity of the optimal control algorithm. <p> Lemma 3.1 (a) V k (x) is a nondecreasing function in each x (j) ; 1 j M . (b) V (x) is a nondecreasing function in each x (j) ; 1 j M . Proof: Mimic the proof of Lemma 3.1 of <ref> [2] </ref>. 6 Lemma 3.2 (a) V k (x) is achieved by a decision rule w k (x) 2 A satisfying P M (j) (b) V (x) is achieved by a decision rule w (x) 2 A satisfying P M Proof: Mimic the proof of Lemma 3.2 of [2]. <p> Lemma 3.1 of <ref> [2] </ref>. 6 Lemma 3.2 (a) V k (x) is achieved by a decision rule w k (x) 2 A satisfying P M (j) (b) V (x) is achieved by a decision rule w (x) 2 A satisfying P M Proof: Mimic the proof of Lemma 3.2 of [2]. <p> We remark that if the holding costs at transmitters i and j are equal, then by a symmetry argument, the minimal total cost is unaltered by a packet transfer from i to j (see Lemma 3.4 of <ref> [2] </ref>). Lemma 3.3 If x (i) 1, then V k (x e i + e j ) V k (x) for j &gt; i; (3.6) Proof: The proof of (3.6) is by induction on k. The assertion trivially holds for k = 0. <p> j ) g (x) 81 i; j n; (4:1) and g is submodular in Z n if g (x + e i e j ) g (x) g (x e j ) g (x e i ) 81 i 6= j n: (4:2) The following two lemmas are proved in <ref> [2] </ref> (see Lemma 4.1 and Lemma 4.2, respectively). We restate them here for completeness. Lemma 4.1 Let g be a function of x = (x 1 ; x 2 ) 2 Z 2 + . <p> The characterization of optimal policies for equally weighted holding costs on all transmitters implies that there is a finite set of allocations such that an optimal allocation can be chosen from the finite set for every discounting factor fi; 0 &lt; fi &lt; 1; this is shown in <ref> [2] </ref>. We were then able to argue in [3] that there is a sequence ffi n g such that fi n ! 1 with f n = f for all n, where f n is an optimal stationary allocation policy corresponding to the discount factor fi n . <p> Moreover, f is then a time average optimal policy possessed of all the properties proved in <ref> [2] </ref> for discounted cost optimal policies. When the holding cost coefficients are unequal, we can no longer assert the existence of a finite set of optimal allocations. <p> Furthermore, f satisfies all the properties of the optimal discounted policies derived in Section 3 and in Section 4 for M = 2. 7 . Conclusions We have generalized the optimal allocation problem of <ref> [2] </ref> to the case of non-identical holding costs at the M transmitters. We derived qualitative properties of optimal discounted and time-average policies that reduce the computational complexity of the M dimensional optimal flow control algorithm.

Reference-contexts: 1 . Introduction The flow control problem addressed in this paper arises in the performance modeling of the `hop-by-hop' layer of computer communication networks.

A policy for the receiver is any function of the abovementioned information that allocates the slots ( T ) among the stations at each phase. In [2] and <ref> [3] </ref>, we investigated discounted and time-average optimal policies when the holding costs are equal at all transmitters. Here, we turn our attention to the general case when the holding costs are not necessarily identical. We believe that this latter case is of more practical interest for the following reason. <p> In Section 5, we further characterize optimal policies when the message generation at the transmitter of higher priority is stochastically larger than the message generation at the other. In Section 6 we point out that the time-average optimal policies have properties similar to those derived in <ref> [3] </ref> for equal holding costs. Conclusions are presented in Section 7. 2 2 . Problem Formulation The operation of the hop-by-hop scheme is as described in the introduction. <p> Proceeding in this fashion, we get V k (x) = G k (x; w fl + ne 1 ne 2 ) where n is the smallest integer such that w (1) (2) 6 . Existence and Properties of Time Average Optimal Policies In <ref> [3] </ref>, we investigated the time average holding cost with equal weighting at the respective nodes. <p> We were then able to argue in <ref> [3] </ref> that there is a sequence ffi n g such that fi n ! 1 with f n = f for all n, where f n is an optimal stationary allocation policy corresponding to the discount factor fi n . <p> Moreover, f is then a time average optimal policy possessed of all the properties proved in [2] for discounted cost optimal policies. When the holding cost coefficients are unequal, we can no longer assert the existence of a finite set of optimal allocations. Nevertheless, the arguments in <ref> [3] </ref> continue to apply without modification, so that we again obtain from [10] a somewhat weaker version of the results stated above.

Reference-contexts: We first define ff (i) = j=1 fl (i) = T ff (i): (3.27) For every initial state, a brute-force optimization over A will require the computa- tion of M 1 allocation schemes (see <ref> [7] </ref>). However, if we take advantage of properties (a) and (b) of Theorem 3.5, the computational complexity of the optimal control algorithm will be reduced.

Reference-contexts: This problem setting is similar to the one of optimal bandwidth allocation in Integrated Service Digital Networks (ISDN's) where various data types (voice, video, file transfer, facsimile, etc.) are transmitted on one channel, see <ref> [8] </ref>. There, one has to design optimal allocation schemes so that (for example) voice has higher transmission priority than file transfer. Others have proposed alternative models for protocols allocating slots between voice and data transmitters.
