Abstract: Some requirements on extensions to X.500 are described in the RFC[HK91b], in order to build an Internet Directory using X.500(1988). This document specifies a set of solutions to the problems raised. These solutions are based on some work done for the QUIPU implementation, and demonstrated to be effective in a number of directory pilots. By documenting a de facto standard, rapid progress can be made towards a full-scale pilot. These procedures are an INTERIM approach. There are known deficiencies, both in terms of manageability and scalability. Transition to standard approaches are planned when appropriate standards are available. This RFCwill be obsoleted at this point.

Reference-contexts: A community is identified by a set of network address prefixes. For the approach to be useful, this set should be small (typically 1). For TCP/IP Networks, and X.25 Networks not providing CONS, the approach is described in <ref> [HK91a] </ref> allows for communities to be defined for the networks of operational interest. This model can be used to determine whether a pair of application entities can communicate. For each entity, determine the presentation address (typically by directory lookup).

These problems are being tackled in the standards arena, but there is currently no stable solution. One approach would be to attempt to intercept the standard.
