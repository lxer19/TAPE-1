Abstract: This paper proposes a user interface for remote access of the National Library of Medicines Visible Human digital image library. Users can visualize the library, browse contents, locate data of interest, and retrieve desired images. The interface presents a pair of tightly coupled views into the library data. The overview image provides a global view of the overall search space, and the preview image provides details about high resolution images available for retrieval. To explore, the user sweeps the views through the search space and receives smooth, rapid, visual feedback of contents. Desired images are automatically downloaded over the internet from the library. Library contents are indexed by meta-data consisting of automatically generated miniature visuals. The interface software is completely functional and freely available for public use, at: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/.

Reference-contexts: With an interface for browsing graph structured information (see [Kor95] for a review of several), users can utilize the links, perhaps representing relationships between documents, to discover related documents that might be found using a query. Implementations include utilizing the Dewey Classification hierarchy to browse a library catalogue <ref> [All94] </ref> and reference citations to browse articles [RPH95]. MeSHbrowse [KS95] is an interface for browsing a medical terminology hierarchy containing arbitrary interrelationships (meta-data) as an index to a medical image digital library. Another structuring method organizes information by defined textual and numerical attributes.

Reference-contexts: Image libraries may also provide for query by image content [FEF94]. In this case, images are indexed by content features and, if available, textual annotations. These interfaces allow users to specify example images, interactively sketch objects, or use an image content description language to create a query. KMeD <ref> [CCT95] </ref> is an example of a multimedia library in the medical domain which combines both textual and medical image elements. Digital video libraries expand the query method further, using speech recognition on the audio tracks of videos for textual indexing [GAE94].

Reference-contexts: Interface elements and strategies for browsing individual 2D images are thoroughly identified [PCS95]. In particular, a coordinated detail view and overview giving contextual feedback, as well as extraneous data download avoidance, are essential elements for remotely browsing very large images <ref> [CPH94] </ref>.

With this technique users drag sliders, click on options, and receive rapid visual feedback to identify desired data axial preview image of the upper abdominal region.

Reference-contexts: Images could also be sequenced by time of capture, as in digital video. In this case, axial cross-sections would correspond to individual frames of the video sequence, and longitudinal sections would show motion patterns of video action across frames <ref> [ED94] </ref>. In fact, we originally encoded the VHE meta-data as an MPEG video, but opted for another representation for performance reasons. Also, the images themselves could be visual representations of more abstract scientific measurements. For example, three orthogonal views of the body.

Reference-contexts: More advanced GUI interfaces afford additional capability to manipulate and visualize the textual query [VN95,YS92]. Image libraries may also provide for query by image content <ref> [FEF94] </ref>. In this case, images are indexed by content features and, if available, textual annotations. These interfaces allow users to specify example images, interactively sketch objects, or use an image content description language to create a query.

While the query method may be an effective means for retrieving documents based on keywords or image features, it does not provide the capability to explore or build a mental model of the contents of a library.

Reference-contexts: Several common structuring methods exist [Lev95]. For example, Hypertext systems such as the WWW organize documents in a hierarchy or other graph representation. With an interface for browsing graph structured information (see <ref> [Kor95] </ref> for a review of several), users can utilize the links, perhaps representing relationships between documents, to discover related documents that might be found using a query. Implementations include utilizing the Dewey Classification hierarchy to browse a library catalogue [All94] and reference citations to browse articles [RPH95].

Reference-contexts: The interface simply provides too much dynamic information for many users to process. Users cognition is consumed by the Orthoviewer interface instead of the data itself. As a result, we designed the VHE interface with a distinct overview-preview pair, as used in many successful browsing interfaces in other domains <ref> [KPS95] </ref>. User Feedback In July 1995, we publicly released the VHE system on our Web site, enabling users to download and use it to access the Visible Human library. Our access logs indicate that over 300 users, from all over the world, have downloaded the software, after just 2 months.

If the two interfaces were tightly coupled, manipulating either the graphical or textual interface elements would immediately show effects in the other domain. Users could browse using a combined strategy, utilizing their knowledge of both medical terminology and visual appearance of human anatomy.

Reference-contexts: Advanced user interface techniques for information exploration can be used to explore the library structure, usually specified by meta-data, and its contents. This gives users a way to learn about the library and locate interesting documents without relying on keyword search. Several common structuring methods exist <ref> [Lev95] </ref>. For example, Hypertext systems such as the WWW organize documents in a hierarchy or other graph representation.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, a sliding indicator in the preview controls the view shown in the overview. For example, the user can slide the overview to show a coronal section nearer to the front or back of the body. (See video report <ref> [NK95] </ref> for a demonstration of the dynamic interaction.) While exploring, when the user locates an axial section in the preview for which high resolution data is desired, pressing the FullSize Image button opens the Retrieval dialog box (Figure 3).

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION The Visible Human The National Library of Medicine (NLM), for its Visible Human Project <ref> [NLM90] </ref>, is in the process of creating a large digital library of anatomical images of the human body. It contains MRI and CT scans, as well as cryosection images (digital color photographs of cross-sections, Figure 1). Two cadavers, one male and one female, were carefully chosen as the subjects.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, each axial section thumbnail provides a preview of and an index to the corresponding full size library image for automated retrieval purposes. For optimal browsing performance, the meta-data is stored locally on the users machine and is preformatted in 8 bit XImage <ref> [Nye90] </ref> format. Hence, as a slider is dragged, new thumbnail images can be moved directly from disk to screen using X Windows shared memory. On an older Sparcstation 1+, images are updated at approximately 20 per second.

Reference-contexts: Guiding principles for designing a user interface for the Visible Human library come from related research of browsing techniques. Firstly, direct manipulation, with compelling success in many exploration interfaces, provides these principles: <ref> [Shn92] </ref> Visual representation of the search space; Rapid, incremental, reversible exploratory actions; Pointing and selecting, instead of typing; and Immediate, continuous, visual feedback of results. Research in digital medical atlases has developed reconstruction and visualization techniques for annotated, segmented, 3D medical image data [HPR95].

Reference-contexts: As has been discovered in exploration interfaces for many other types of data, a visual overview of the data space is extremely helpful <ref> [Shn94] </ref>. When users search for specific data, the VHE overview quickly guides them to the desired location. It provides context for the axial preview thumbnails, some of which would otherwise be difficult to interpret exactly.

Reference-contexts: Then, when a user enters a query, the system can quickly generate a list of matching documents. Since many of these libraries contain textual documents only, such as computer science technical reports <ref> [Van94] </ref>, and use strictly textual queries, interfaces are often text-based for simple WWW or teletype access. More advanced GUI interfaces afford additional capability to manipulate and visualize the textual query [VN95,YS92]. Image libraries may also provide for query by image content [FEF94].
