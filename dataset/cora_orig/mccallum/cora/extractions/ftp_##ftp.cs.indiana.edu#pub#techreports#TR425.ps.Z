Abstract: We propose an algorithm for generating a moving coordinate frame on a space curve based on the concept of parallel transport. Such algorithms can be used for creating ribbons, tubes, and camera orientations that are smoothly varying and controlled by the curve geometry itself. The more familiar Frenet frame approach suffers from ambiguity and sudden orientation changes when the curve straightens out momentarily. We compare the properties of alternative framing methods and point out when the parallel transport approach has unique advantages. We discuss a variety of implementation issues and illustrate the application of the algorithm to ribbons and tubes based on open and closed curves, as well as to the generation of moving camera orientations.

Reference-contexts: We propose an alternative approach, the parallel-transport frame method (see Bishop <ref> [1] </ref>), which has a mathematically sound foundation and more appropriate behavior for computer graphics; in cases where the Frenet frame has desirable properties, a hybrid strategy is also feasible. <p> We therefore have the alternative frame equations 2 6 ~ T 0 1 2 7 5 = v 6 0 k 1 k 2 k 2 0 0 7 2 6 ~ T ~ N 2 7 5 : (6) One can show (see, e.g, Bishop <ref> [1] </ref>) that (t) = (k 1 ) 2 + (k 2 ) 2 (7) (t) = arctan k 1 (8) d (t) ; (9) so that k 1 and k 2 effectively correspond to a Cartesian coordinate system for the polar coordinates ; with = R t (t) dt. <p> Acknowledgments This work was supported in part by NSF grant IRI-91-06389.

Reference-contexts: Classical differential geometry typically treats moving frames using the Frenet frame formalism because of its close association with a curve's curvature and torsion, which are coordinate-system independent <ref> [2, 9, 4] </ref>. The Frenet frame, unfortunately, has the property that it is undefined when the curve is even momentarily straight (has vanishing curvature), and exhibits wild swings in orientation around points where the osculating plane's normal has major changes in direction. <p> We will assume that our curves are defined in practice by a discrete sequence of points connected by straight line segments; thus numerical derivatives can be defined at each point. 2.1 Frenet Frames The Frenet frame (see, e.g., <ref> [2, 4] </ref>) is defined as follows: If ~ x (t) is any thrice-differentiable space curve with non-vanishing second derivative, its tangent, binormal, and normal vectors at a point on the curve are given by ~ T (t) = k ~ x 0 (t)k ~ x 0 (t) fi ~ x 00

Reference-contexts: We see that the parallel transport frame in some sense washes out the torsion, leaving the minimal possible changes in direction required by the curvature alone. An informative way of visualizing these properties would be to plot the paths of the equivalent quaternions on the 3-sphere in four-dimensional space <ref> [5] </ref>. As with the Frenet equations, we can begin with a pair of functions (k 1 (t); k 2 (t)) and an initial frame, and then integrate any alternate form of the frame equations to find the curve ~ x (t) up to a rigid motion.

Reference-contexts: If the curve is coarsely refined, but is smooth enough to generate appropriate frame control points from the parallel-transport frame algorithm, the resulting frames can be used as control points for any desired degree of smooth spline interpolations using the methods of Shoemake [7] and Schlag <ref> [6] </ref>. Rotating camera orientations relative to a stable forward-facing frame can be added by various techniques such as that of Shoemake [8]. <p> This is easily corrected by reinterpreting the camera frame fields at each curve vertex as key frames for a Shoemake-style quaternion interpolation <ref> [7, 6] </ref>; then the camera orientations will move smoothly throughout the curve, passing through or near the vertex frame fields, depending on the particular spline chosen. In addition, certain classes of camera rolls and spins can be handled naturally as well.

Reference-contexts: Rotating camera orientations relative to a stable forward-facing frame can be added by various techniques such as that of Shoemake <ref> [8] </ref>. In Section 2, we introduce the basic mathematics of moving frames on space curves, emphasizing the parallel transport frame; the properties of the Frenet and parallel-transport frames are compared. Our algorithms are given in Section 3, where applications to the generation of ribbons, tubes, and camera frames are described. <p> The simplest such case is the one in which the additional motions take place with respect to the parallel-transport frame of the curve. More complex motions can be handled by a variety of interpolation methods (see, e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>). 12 4 Conclusion and Future Directions In this paper, we have introduced a coherent method for generating smooth moving frames based on the geometry of a space curve. Our principal new tool is the parallel-transport frame, supplemented when appropriate by the classical Frenet frame.
