Abstract: For three finite difference approximations of the Stokes equations, the Schur complement Q h of the linear system generated by each of these approximations is shown to have its condition number (Q h ) independent of mesh size. This result is used to prove convergence estimates of the solutions generated by Q h for these approximations. One of the convergence estimates is for a staggered mesh scheme and the estimate for this scheme shows that both the pressure and the velocity are second-order accurate.

Reference-contexts: The iterative method based on solving (1.7) by the CG method is called the PE method. A popular iterative method to solve the Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations is the pressure poisson equation (PPE) method, see <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> A boundary condition for pressure is needed to solve this equation and it is not clear which boundary condition is appropriate, see <ref> [4] </ref>. The PE method is similar to the pressure poisson equation (PPE) method in the sense that they use equations for pressure only, but the PE method doesn't require a boundary condition for pressure. 2 2.

Reference-contexts: The method works better with polar domains since the Poisson equation can be solved directly with the help of the line SOR method. A lot of domains in applications are decomposed into some rectangular and some polar domains. Using the Schwarz alternating procedure <ref> [7] </ref> with a parallel algorithm, the PE method should work efficiently.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. The pressure equation (PE) method, a new fast iterative method to solve finite difference approximations of the Stokes and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations has been introduced by Shin and Strikwerda <ref> [10] </ref>. The PE method and many other iterative methods to solve the Stokes equations are heavily dependent on the properties the Schur complements of the linear systems resulting from discretizations of these equations, which we investigate in this paper. We first review the PE method. <p> These results were basically by the inf-sup conditions that are proved by Shin and Strikwerda [11]. Current research is on getting the inf-sup conditions for other finite difference approximations. The PE method has been extended to the Navier-Stokes equations for low Reynolds numbers by Shin and Strikwerda <ref> [10] </ref>. Many algorithms that use differenct linearizing techniques could be applied for the extension of the PE method to the Navier-Stokes equations. Research is continuing on getting a better algorithm that works for higher Reynolds numbers.
