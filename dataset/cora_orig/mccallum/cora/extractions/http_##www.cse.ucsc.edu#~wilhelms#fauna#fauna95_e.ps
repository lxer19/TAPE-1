Abstract: In order to achieve greater realism, we are applying anatomical and physiological principles to model and animate animals. Underlying components represent bones, muscles, and soft tissue. For speed and simplicity, these are modeled from ellipsoids. Muscles stretch across joints, and their orientations, sizes, and shapes change during joint motion. A polygonal skin is automatically generated from the underlying structures. The skin mesh adjusts itself to changes in position under the influence of neighboring skin points and connections to the underlying anatomy. Much of the process is automated, but under the control of user-defined parameters. Manipulation and animation of these models occur at comfortable interactive speeds on graphics workstations.

Reference-contexts: The isosurface for a given threshold value in the field can be extracted by a wide variety of approaches [NH93]. Blinn wrote a seminal paper on implicit surface modeling which created a "blobby man" by extracting a surface from around an articulated skeleton, but underlying anatomy wasn't modeled <ref> [Bli82] </ref>. Our method uses a "marching-cubes" approach [LC87], which is simple, fast, and sufficient for present purposes. A cell of the grid is defined by eight corner points. An isosurface crosses the cell if some of the data values at these corners are above the threshold and others are below.

Reference-contexts: Anchor points were displaced when joint angles changed. Simulated muscles were only attached to a single segment in the hierarchy, and individual muscles were not modeled. Creating natural-looking skin and deformations across joints is a particularly difficult problem and this is where many animal models fail <ref> [BZ91] </ref>. Gourret, Magnenat-Thalmann, and Thalmann used finite-element theory to model the hand during grasping [GMTT89]. Their method simulated shape changes during motion, including effects of contact between flesh and objects, using solid elements such as cubes, prisms, and tetrahedra and a spring-like model.

Both were initially digitized from real physical models. 2.1 Model Construction Chadwick, Haumann, and Parent presented a method for layered construction of flexible animated characters <ref> [CHP89] </ref>. A polygonal skin model was associated either with a freeform deformation abstractly representing muscle and fatty tissue or with the skeletal hierarchy itself. The deformation was affected by kinematics based on joint angles, dynamics based on mass-spring model of control points, or interactive sculpting by 2 the user.

Reference-contexts: Here the main interest was visual realism and speed; no attempt is made to accurately model the internal hand anatomy. Chen and Zeltzer presented a biomechanically based muscle model using a finite element method to realistically simulate a few individual muscles <ref> [CZ92] </ref>. The muscles were modeled using polyhedral meshes, and a biomechanical contaction model used to calculate non-linear forces at mesh points. The simulated muscles showed good correspondence to actual measured muscle behavior. This research concentrated on accurately simulating individual muscle behavior. Overlying skin was not modeled.

Reference-contexts: Unlike our own model, they did not simulate individual muscles that cross joints, and the skin was embedded in the deformations, not flexibly attached to underlying structures. Mark Henne also used a layered approach <ref> [Hen90] </ref>. A bicubic surface skin was pushed outward by localized "velocity" fields. These implicit fields represented bones, fat, and muscles, and were connected to a hierarchical body structure. <p> We use the virtual anchor (the rest position of a skin point) rather than the anchor on the ellipsoid because it gives better visual results. Henne also used the rest position as the anchor <ref> [Hen90] </ref>. If the ellipsoid anchor is used, the point can rotate around the anchor and find a stable position very close to or even inside the ellipsoid. While collision detection can take care of this, it is expensive.

In the third step, an isosurface of a user-defined threshold is extracted from the filtered volume to produce a polygonal skin model <ref> [LC87] </ref>. This is represented as a list of vertices representing points on the skin surface together with outward-pointing normal vectors at those points; a list of polygons each specified as a list of pointers into the vertex list; and a list of edges describing connectivity between vertices.

Reference-contexts: The edges act like springs and adjust the positions of vertices when the body moves. The edge length when extracted is the rest length for these "springs." Our approach is quite a bit simpler than some other voxelization and filtering approaches described in the literature (e.g., <ref> [WK94] </ref>). However, unlike most voxelization approaches, we are not interested in an exact representation of the objects sampled (the component ellipsoids in this case), but rather a sense of where they are.
