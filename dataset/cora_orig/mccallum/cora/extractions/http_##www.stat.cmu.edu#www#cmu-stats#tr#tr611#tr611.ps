Abstract: The problem of the preservation of confidentiality for the release of micro-data samples is reconsidered in the context of estimating an empirical cumulative density function. A proposal is made for the use of a bootstrap-like approach to the generation of synthetic microdata files. Many details in the proposal require careful attention, and the implications of the proposed method for data disclosure still need to be explored empirically. The method suggested here bears a remarkable similarity to a proposal by Rubin (1993) for the use of multiple imputation for data disclosure limitation.

Reference-contexts: Thus the agency alters the 2 data and instead releases F fl . This alteration may be based on masking techniques such as rounding, the addition of error, or other masking techniques <ref> (e.g., see Duncan and Pearson, 1991, and Fienberg, 1994) </ref>. Because these techniques tend to take individual records and alter them, releasing either F or F fl is releasing information about the original survey respondents.

Reference-contexts: Missing data create additional problems. We need to decide if missing data are missing at random or at least whether the missing data mechanism is ignorable. 4 Related Work Rubin (1993) proposes an application of multiple imputation <ref> (Rubin, 1987) </ref> which bears remarkable similarity to the proposal in this note. His approach stresses the role of multiple (rather than a single) synthetic microdata sets. Many of the same details that we need to develop for our proposal need to be flushed out for Rubin's proposal.

Reference-contexts: The interesting issue is whether or not we want to use the original sample design when we draw a bootstrap sample from ^ F <ref> (see Rubin, 1993, for related remarks) </ref>. The design of the bootstrap sample might be more "efficient" if it were different from that of the original sample. Such differences might also limit the possibilities of disclosure.
