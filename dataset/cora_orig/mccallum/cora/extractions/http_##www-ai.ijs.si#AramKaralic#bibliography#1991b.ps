Title: MACHINE LEARNING IN

Abstract: One of the major problems in the development of expert systems is construction of a knowledge base. Instead of the classical methods (interviewing the experts from a certain area), automatic knowledge synthesis can be used to speed up the process. We constructed a knowledge base for rheumatology in the form of decision trees by methodology of learning from examples used in the system ASSISTANT. Knowledge was verified by testing the classification accuracy of the obtained decision trees on new examples (patients). We also compared classification accuracy of induced trees with that of the general practitioners.

Reference-contexts: Most of the well known expert systems, such as MYCIN <ref> [1] </ref> and PROSPECTOR [2] were constructed this way. This method of knowledge-acquisition at the present state of the expert systems technology makes the knowledge-base construction the most expensive and time consuming stage in the development of expert systems. The problem is known as the "Feigenbaum bottleneck".

These improvements are described elsewhere [6] and deal mostly with new methods to combat noise in the data (incorrect data) and incompleteness of the data (missing values for some attributes).

Reference-contexts: Absolute classification accuracy: percentage of the unseen patients, which were cor rectly classified (diagnosed) by the induced decision tree. * Entropy: average amount of information (bits) needed to correctly classify one pa tient. * Information content: amount of the information, contributed by the tree for classi fication of one example <ref> [4] </ref>. * Relative information content (RIC): RIC = information content entropy The experiments with ASSISTANT were run on MicroVAX II. Parameter settings for the system were as listed in Figure 6.

Reference-contexts: For example: from observing how the doctor diagnosed 10000 patients, such a system could learn how to diagnose previously unseen patients. This kind of learning is called learning from examples. For automatic learning from examples a system called ASSISTANT <ref> [5] </ref> was developed at the E. Kardelj University, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Jo`ef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana. Knowledge synthesis in ASSISTANT is based on learning from examples.

Reference-contexts: These improvements are described elsewhere <ref> [6] </ref> and deal mostly with new methods to combat noise in the data (incorrect data) and incompleteness of the data (missing values for some attributes). ASSISTANT's learning algorithm first selects the most informative attribute and splits a learning set into subsets.
