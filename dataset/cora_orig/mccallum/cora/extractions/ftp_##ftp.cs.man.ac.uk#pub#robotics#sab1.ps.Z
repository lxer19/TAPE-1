Abstract: The Really Useful Robots (RUR) project is seeking to understand how robots can be built that develop and maintain the task achieving compe-tences they require for flexible and robust be-haviour in variable and unforeseen situations, as opposed to these being installed by their designers. In this paper we present an experimental autonomous robot with a map building competence which uses a self-organising network. Map building forms a necessary step on the way to development of a navigational competence. Some encouraging initial test results are also presented.

Reference-contexts: This first requires a mapbuilding competence. As in controlling mobile robots, so in mapbuild-ing a traditional approach can be taken. The traditional approach either uses some kind of fixed structure that is filled with information as it is obtained by sensory activities,see, for example, <ref> [De Almeida 1989] </ref>, [Moravec 1988], [Goto and Stentz 1987] or [Tsai et al 1990]. We call these `self detailing schemes'. Alternatively, a complete `ready-made' map may be provided from the start, see, for example, [Tsubouchi and Yuta 1987], which we call `pre-installed map schemes'.

Reference-contexts: It eventually became zero. 4 Comparison with Bee Naviga tion As <ref> [Cartwright and Collett 1983] </ref> have found in their experiments, Apis mellifera use nearby landmarks to guide their way to a food source. "[Bees] do not find their way using anything analogous to a floor plan or map of the spatial layout of landmarks and food source. <p> similarity to bee navigation is the fact that the mechanism described in this paper is very robust and fairly immune to noise. `Undetected' corners, varying distance measurements and even moving the robot to a different location (without the control algoithm realising this) do not impair Alder's ability to recognize locations. <ref> [Cartwright and Collett 1983] </ref>: "The bee's guidance system is immune to a considerable amount of noise". 5 Conclusion Building an internal state space representation (a map) is an essential step towards developing a navigational competence in a mobile robot. We have shown that it can be achieved, using self-organising networks. <p> The mechanism presented is similar to the `feature recognition' mechanism used by bees to navigate|bees compare stored retinal patterns to the current retinal pattern to calculate a flight direction vector ([Gould 1988] [Waterman 1989] and <ref> [Cartwright and Collett 1983] </ref>). The next step in the RUR project is to develop a network that can learn the relationships between physical movements in the world and observed activity changes in the self-organising network (the bottom block shown in figure 1), which will make true navigation possible.

Reference-contexts: Alder uses a self-organising network (see <ref> [Kohonen 1988] </ref>) to construct internal representations of the world it experiences as it moves around. <p> Whenever the term `map' is used in this paper it is used in the sense of the definition given above, i.e. a bijection of state-space on to map-space. 2 Self-Organising Networks Unsupervised learning can be achieved, using self-organising networks <ref> [Kohonen 1988] </ref>. These networks develop internal representations of the input space by mapping distinct input vectors onto distinct areas of the network (injection). One advantage of these networks is that they can accept redundancy in the input vectors.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The traditional approach to control in (mobile) robots is to decompose the task into separate components, and implement these using standard control techniques, see <ref> [Levi 1987] </ref>, for example. This we call an analytical approach. Alternatively, a control structure can be built `bottom up', first building foundational competences (such as `move around and avoid obstacles'), and later fl c flU. Nehmzow and T.
