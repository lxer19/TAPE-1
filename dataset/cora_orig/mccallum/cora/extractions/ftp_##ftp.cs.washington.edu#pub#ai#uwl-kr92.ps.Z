Abstract: Classical planners presuppose complete and correct information about the world. This paper provides the syntax and semantics for uwl, a representation for goals and actions that facilitates planning with incomplete information about the world's state. While the expressive power of uwl is limited compared to previous work on logics of knowledge and belief, uwl has the advantage of being easily incorporated into planning algorithms. We describe a provably correct planning algorithm based on uwl. To demonstrate uwl's expressive power we encode a subset of the UNIX 1 domain (planning to achieve UNIX goals, using UNIX shell commands as primitive actions), which is difficult to capture using existing planning languages. fl Authors' names are listed alphabetically within two status-oriented equivalence classes. Our research was funded in part by National Science Foundation Grants IRI-8957302 and IRI-9008670, Office of Naval Research Grant 90-J-1904, a NASA Graduate Student Researcher's Fellowship, an Office of Naval Research Graduate Fellowship, and a grant from the Xerox corporation. Helpful comments were provided by Keiji Kanazawa, Craig Knoblock, and Leora Morgenstern. 1 UNIX is a trademark of AT&T Bell Labs.

Reference-contexts: Developing a complete taxonomy of information goals is an area of future research. 3 Partial-Order Planning with uwl We have worked to keep uwl close to the familiar strips representation in order to build on the long-standing body of work on planning algorithms using that representation (see <ref> [Allen et al. 1990] </ref> for a survey). In this section we present the SENS P algorithm, a provably sound partial-order planner for uwl based on snlp [McAllester and Rosenblitt 1991,Barrett et al. 1991,Hanks and Weld 1992].

Reference-contexts: She considers the expression of complex plans using sequential, conditional, iterative, and concurrent constructs, and axiomatizes their knowledge preconditions.

Reference-contexts: The language is used only for the specification of goals. Although the top-level goals can be annotated, operator preconditions are restricted to be conjunctions of simple propositions. Our work is close to that of <ref> [Olawsky and Gini 1990] </ref>, which specifically considers the problem of planning with an incomplete initial world-state description. Their approach uses deferred planning: when a proposition's truth value is needed but unknown they suspend the planning process, execute a plan to learn its value, then resume planning.
