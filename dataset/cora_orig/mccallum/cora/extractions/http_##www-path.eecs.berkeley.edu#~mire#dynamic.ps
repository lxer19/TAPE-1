Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic model for automated traffic flow. The model is based on the abstraction of vehicle activities derived from a vehicle's automatic control laws by the space and time taken up by the vehicle engaged in the activity. The paper develops the laws of conservation of vehicles and velocity dynamics, and defines static, manuever, and interaction capacity obtainable with the model.

Reference-contexts: Activities are used to characterized vehicle behavior that results from vehicle-borne control laws. Activities provide a means to abstract vehicle behavior without requiring individual simulation of vehicles, thus yielding a meso-scale simulation model. This paper is an extension of the work in <ref> (Broucke and Varaiya, 1996) </ref> which presented theory for a one-lane automated highway with stationary input flows. 2. <p> We define N int (i; t) as the number of vehicles that perform interacting activity pairs in section i at time t. For brevity, we omit the expression for N int (i; t) here. To investigate the effect of interacting activity pairs, we employ a queueing model developed in <ref> (Broucke and Varaiya, 1996) </ref>. Consider one interacting activity pair (ff 1 ; ff 2 ). <p> Additional constraints can be imposed on the TMC plan to satisfy requirements of vehicles making their exits and entering at the appropriate sec tion and constraints on allowed activities. These are discussed in greater detail in <ref> (Broucke and Varaiya, 1996) </ref>. We will say that a trajectory-plan (n; u) is feasible if the constraints (3)-(4) and (8)-(10) are satisfied. We say a trajectory-plan (n; u) is laterally feasible if in addition constraint (11) is satisfied. <p> section i (i) = L (i) n (i) ; while the maximum flow (i) is (i) = V T Define fl as the minimum of the maximum pos sible flow out of any section of a lane or fl = min V T = min (i): (12) We showed in <ref> (Broucke and Varaiya, 1996) </ref> that fl is the capacity of a lane. Now we define network capacity. Ford Fulkerson Theorem Suppose we are given a network of highway links consisting of one or more lanes.

Reference-contexts: In a feedback formulation of the control law (see <ref> (Frankel et al., 1995) </ref>) an envelope of safe speed as a function of the separation between two vehicles is found. What is known about the maneuver is the initial separation x 0 , the final separation x f , and the allowed speed as a function of separation v (x).

Reference-contexts: Finally, the speed achieved in a section, which can be no larger than the desired velocity and the space-filling velocity can be reduced by interactions among vehicles. This loss in speed due to interactions (see <ref> (Prigogine, 1971) </ref> for a related treatment), called ffiv, is subtracted from the speed achievable in a section in non-interacting flow.
