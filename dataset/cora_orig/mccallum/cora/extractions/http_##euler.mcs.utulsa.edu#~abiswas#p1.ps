Title: Effects of misconception on reciprocative agents

Abstract: In open systems, agents act to serve their self-interests instead of working towards group goals. We investigate the choice of interaction strategies and environmental characteristics that will make the best self-interested actions to be cooperative in nature. In our previous work, we have presented a probabilistic reciprocity mechanism that produces stable, cooperative behavior among a group of self-interested agents. The resultant system was found to exhibit close to optimal throughput with a fair distribution of the workload among the participating agents. In this paper, we test the robustness of this scheme by changing some of the assumptions used before. In particular, we evaluate the performance of reciprocative agents when an agent receiving help from another agent underestimates the cost incurred by the helping agent. This kind of misconceptions can derail cooperative processes leading to disintegration of stable groups. Results from experiments with several kinds of misconceptions, however, testify to the robustness of the reciprocative strategy.

Reference-contexts: In a seminal piece of work Robert Axelrod has shown how stable cooperative behavior can arise in self-interested agents when they adopt a reciprocative attitude towards each other <ref> [1] </ref>. Axelrod shows that a simple, deterministic reciprocal scheme of cooperating with another agent who has cooperated in the previous interaction, is quite robust and efficient in maximizing local utility.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Researchers involved in the design of intelligent agents that will interact with other agents in an open, distributed system are faced with the challenge of modeling other agents and their behavior <ref> [5] </ref>. If one can can assume that all agents will be cooperative in nature, efficient mechanisms can be developed to take advantage of mutual cooperation. But, in an open system, assumptions about cooperative agents or system-wide common goals are hard to justify.

Reference-contexts: By using a multia-gent domain where agents can exchange their tasks, we have shown that agents can use the principle of reciprocity to effectively adapt to the environment, optimizing local performance <ref> [12] </ref>. We developed a probabilistic reciprocity mechanism that was found to be stable against invasion by selfish agents (agents who received help but never helped others). <p> Though Axelrod's work is interesting and convincing, we have argued <ref> [12] </ref> that the assumptions used in his work makes the results inapplicable in a number of practical domains. Some of the problematic assumptions are: Initial decision: Axelrod assumes that such agents start of cooperating; if agents start off by not cooperating, then the tit-for-tat strategy will never produce cooperative action. <p> R=reciprocative, UR=underestimating reciprocative agents i.e. our reciprocative strategy is stable even in the presence of misconception. 5 Conclusions In our previous work, we have shown that self-motivated behavior can evolve cooperation among a group of autonomous agents leading to near-optimal local and system performance <ref> [12] </ref>. In this paper, we have relaxed restrictive assumptions of accurate cost estimation and beneficial cooperation between reciprocative agents. Performance is again close to optimal with both over and under-estimation of the amount of help received by an agent.
