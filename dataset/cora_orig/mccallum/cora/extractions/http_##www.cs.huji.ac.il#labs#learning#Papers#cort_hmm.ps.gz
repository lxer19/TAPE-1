Abstract: A widely held idea regarding information processing in the brain is the cell-assembly hypothesis suggested by Hebb in 1949. According to this hypothesis, the basic unit of information processing in the brain is an assembly of cells, which can act briefly as a closed system, in response to a specific stimulus. This work presents a novel method of characterizing this supposed activity using a Hidden Markov Model. This model is able to reveal some of the underlying cortical network activity of behavioral processes. In our study the process in hand was the simultaneous activity of several cells recorded from the frontal cortex of behaving monkeys. Using such a model we were able to identify the behavioral mode of the animal and directly identify the corresponding collective network activity. Furthermore, the segmentation of the data into the discrete states also provides direct evidence for the state dependency of the short-time correlation functions between the same pair of cells. Thus, this cross-correlation depends on the network state of activity and not on local connectivity alone.

Reference-contexts: The cell-assembly hypothesis shifts the focus from the single neuron to the complete network activity. This view has led several laboratories to develop technology for simultaneous multi-cellular recording from a small region in the associative cortex <ref> [Abe91, Kru83] </ref>. Extracellular electro-physiological measurements have so far obtained simultaneous recordings from just a few randomly selected neurons (about 10) in the cortex, a negligible number compared to the size of the hypothesized cell-assembly. These are recordings of simultaneous firing activities of randomly selected cortical neurons of a behaving animal. <p> The outcome model was furthermore used to compute the pair-wise cross-correlation. 4.1. Transforming the spike train into firing rates In this implementation of the hidden Markov model we assume that each of the spike trains are distributed according to a Poisson distribution <ref> [Abe91] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The two works give a consistent picture of flips between collective cell activity states which clearly depend on the behavior and activity of the behaving animal <ref> [ABG + 95] </ref>. 3 The main contribution of the present work, in addition to the detailed exposition of our technique, is in the relationship found between the segmentation of the data into states of collective activity and the pairwise correlations between the cells.

The term functional connectivity (also referred to as effective connectivity) [MPS66, PGM67] is used in this context because of the cell-assembly hypothesis which implies that this correlation is due to the activity of the whole cell-assembly.

Reference-contexts: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct electro physiological evidence for such recurrent cortical dynamical processes. The existence of dynamical changes in the cross-correlation function has already being shown in previous works <ref> [AVA + 92] </ref>. The statistical model used was a hidden Markov model (HMM), whose observations were the firing rate vectors of several cells recorded simultaneously. Our model assumption was that, given the states, the cells are conditionally independent,Poisson processes.

Reference-contexts: The idea of applying hidden Markov models (HMM) to cortical data was first introduced by us in 1992 <ref> [GT93] </ref>, where we showed the basic idea of using multivariate Poisson HMM for multi-electrode recordings. Following our work, Radon et al [RBDK94] applied the same technique to data recorded from the visual cortex and obtained similar segmentation of the data, with little concrete biological conclusions. <p> The Markovian state machine offers such a possibility. 6.1. Relations to other works We are aware of two other works applying HMM to cortical recordings of multiple neurons, both followed our initial report in 1992 <ref> [GT93] </ref>. The first work, by Radon et al in 1994 [RBDK94], compared the non-homogeneous Poisson model (NHPM), which is essentially a PSTH, with a left-to-right HMM. They claimed that the NHPM gives a more appropriate description of the neuronal data, at least in the visual cortex.

Reference-contexts: The second problem is that the HMM used is not the best possible HMM for this data. In fact, when applying our HMM approach on precisely the same behavioral detection events used by Seidmann et al the HMM is found to be superior to the NHPM <ref> [GT97] </ref>, unlike their reported results.

Relations to other works We are aware of two other works applying HMM to cortical recordings of multiple neurons, both followed our initial report in 1992 [GT93]. The first work, by Radon et al in 1994 <ref> [RBDK94] </ref>, compared the non-homogeneous Poisson model (NHPM), which is essentially a PSTH, with a left-to-right HMM. They claimed that the NHPM gives a more appropriate description of the neuronal data, at least in the visual cortex.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the model is sufficiently rich in the possible structure of its output, which has made the Hidden Markov technology attractive for tackling problems in language, speech and signal processing <ref> [LRS74, RJLS86] </ref>. The general HMM is constructed of the following elements: * The states of the Markov process change according to specific transition probabilities. * The states cannot be observed directly. Only the stochastic output of the state at each point in time is observable.

Reference-contexts: It is possible, however, to find local maxima of this function, and two of the algorithms performing this task are: (i) The Baum-Welch method, also known as the EM (expectation maximization) method [DLR77, BP66, Bau72]. (ii) The Segmental K-means technique <ref> [LRS74, JR90, RWJ86] </ref>. The Baum-Welch algorithm provides an estimate which locally maximizes the likelihood function of the given observation sequence, and the segmental K-means algorithm provides an estimate which locally maximizes the joint likelihood of the observation sequence and the most likely state sequence.

Reference-contexts: Following our work, Radon et al [RBDK94] applied the same technique to data recorded from the visual cortex and obtained similar segmentation of the data, with little concrete biological conclusions. Later on, Seidemann et al <ref> [SAMV96] </ref> used a similar technique, applied to the same experimental data, in a finer temporal resolution. While their work supported the general picture we presented, it showed sharper state flips by allowing state transition every 1ms. <p> However, this work did not utilize the vector activity, as we suggested, and thus didn't take advantage of the main power of the HMM. The other work, by Seidmann et al <ref> [SAMV96] </ref>, was similar in several ways to our work. It was applied to a similar data, recorded from frontal and prefrontal cortex, but was used in a supervised way following a stimulus, in a much finer temporal resolution.

Reference-contexts: This fact by itself shows that the requisite information cannot be coded in the activity of a single cell alone <ref> [SHS82] </ref>. Still, the PSTH is a valuable tool for measuring the firing rate of cells, and can give a flexible estimation in the time domain. An example of PSTH and the raster display which was the source of computation is shown in figure 2.

Reference-contexts: This technique analyzes the spike trains of a pair of cells for possible temporal relations, by computing the cross-correlation function of the two spike trains. Departures from background in the correlogram are taken as an indication of functional connectivity between the two cells <ref> [AGHP89, VABL91] </ref>. The term functional connectivity (also referred to as effective connectivity) [MPS66, PGM67] is used in this context because of the cell-assembly hypothesis which implies that this correlation is due to the activity of the whole cell-assembly. <p> The temporal cross-correlation function between cells measures the similarity of the spike trains of two cells and can be computed within bins (windows) of variable length. The figures representing the cross-correlation function with a specific bin width are called cross-correlograms <ref> [VABL91] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a typical computation process consists of a sequence of activations of these functional units, and will henceforth be referred to as a sequence of cognitive states. The notion of the cell-assembly has been formalized since Hebb first suggested it <ref> [vdM85, Pal82] </ref>. Furthermore, the cell-assembly hypothesis matches the present knowledge about the anatomical structure of the cortex, especially the structure of the high cortical areas [GBA89, BS91]. The cell-assembly hypothesis shifts the focus from the single neuron to the complete network activity.
