Title: A Comparison of Three Different Methods for Acquiring Knowledge about Virological Hepatitis Tests 1

Abstract: We present a comparison of Knowledge Seeker, CN2 and Knowledge EXplorer based on a real problem domain, interpretation of virological hepatitis tests. The problem domain can be divided into 6 subdomains, where the knowledge can be acquired separately. Unlike classical machine learning problems the goal classes are not mutually exclusive. The information how to classify contradictory examples was not available for the systems during learning. So the key question was how the systems handle ambiguity in data. Although each system uses different approach, there was no significant difference in the results of testing of acquired rules done for each subdomain separately. Testing in the whole hepatitis domain was done only for Knowledge EXplorer because only this system can predict multiple classes. The results of testing are poorer then results obtained in the separate subdomains but can be improved by using some additional expert's knowledge.

Reference-contexts: When consulting for the case AAK = n & AGM = n, the result will be 15/HAV (from the rule no. 6). 3.3 Knowledge EXplorer Knowledge EXplorer has been developed at the Prague School of Economics <ref> [1, 6] </ref>. The system performs symbolic empirical multiple concept learning from examples, where the induced concept description is of the form of weighted decision rules. The algorithm can deal with noisy data, unknown values, redundancy and contradictions.

Reference-contexts: The Prolog rules can be used for consultations with inference mechanism supplied by the system. When consulting for the case AAK = n & AGM = n, the result will be d (15/HAV) (from the rule no. 7). 3.2 CN2 CN2 is a system of the AQ family <ref> [4] </ref>. It induces decision rules from given examples. The system performes non incremental multiple concept learning. Unlike standard AQ, CN2 can work with noisy data. CN2 works in an iterative way each step generating a rule and then removing the examples the rule covers from the training set.

Reference-contexts: The weight of this new rule is computed from the validity and the composed weight using inverse composing function. For composing weights PROSPECTOR's <ref> [5] </ref> combining function is used. During expanding, new implications are created by adding single categories to Ant. Unlike AQ-like systems, Knowledge EXplorer does not remove covered examples from the training data set. So more than one rule can be learned for the same class from an example.
