Abstract: The proxac editor can be found in ftp directory jan/proxac on cs.caltech.edu. A more detailed description can be found in [7] and an up-to-date version thereof can be found in the same ftp directory. Writing this editor and developing the notations used was, and is, a challenging undertaking. Diana Finley was instrumental in getting this project underway. Greg Davis contributed many ideas and helped get the program to the point where it actually became usable. My thanks go to both of them.
