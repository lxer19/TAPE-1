Reference-contexts: This class includes motions such as opening a door, lifting a briefcase, or throwing a ball. An alternative characterization of temporal textures is based on the types of physical deformations occurring during the motion <ref> [1] </ref>. The simplest type of motion is rigid motion, which involves no deformation at all. All distances and angles of the moving object are preserved. This area has been extensively studied in the field of structure from motion, and other fields in machine vision.

Reference-contexts: Segmentation and normalization can be based on static image cues and be done independently of the motion characterization, but can also benefit from motion cues. An example of segmentation and normalization using motion is given by Allmen and Dyer <ref> [2] </ref>. They find spatio-temporal curves that are tangent to the optical flow at each frame. Intuitively, these curves trace out the position of a specific point in space-time. They can be computed directly from the optical flow using the Runge-Kutta approximation method for differential equations.

Reference-contexts: Several other low-level characterizations of motion exist in the literature. Interesting motion events can be extracted from the spatio-temporal curves.

Below, we will review a few texture models including autoregressive models and a fractal model.

Reference-contexts: William Wei To fit an ARMA model, we must decide on two things before we can start: the neighborhood size and its topology. Box and Jenkins <ref> [4] </ref> pioneered the following approach in the context of time series analysis. 1. Model identification: AR (p), MA (q), or ARMA (p,q)? Select model order (p and q). 2. Parameter estimation. 3. <p> The three methods differ in the assumptions about the boundaries. The conditional technique assume a specific value for the boundary (see Section 3.7.1). The unconditional method attempts to predict the missing values using backcasting. Backcasting involves applying the ARMA model in the reverse direction <ref> [4] </ref>. Finally, the exact maximum likelihood makes no assumptions about the boundary at all. The exact maximum likelihood method is regarded to be the most accurate, but is difficult to derive and has no closed form solution for the estimates. <p> The variance of the innovation sequence a (x) can be estimated from ^ 2 E : The jj is the number of data points used in the estimate. There is some debate about whether or not the number of estimated parameters p should be subtracted off in the denominator <ref> [4] </ref>. In the cases considered here, the difference is minimal since jj p. <p> The covariance method, on the other hand, only uses existing data. Thus, is the inner subset of the data such that the neighbors of every point in are known. The covariance method is recommended as more robust by Box and Jenkins <ref> [4] </ref>. However, the correlation method offers a few computational advantages. Firstly, the R (i; j) are scaled autocorrelations, which can be computed as the inverse Fourier transform of the power spectrum of the data. This is much faster for models with many parameters (see Section 3.8).

Reference-contexts: To create realistic dynamics, the convection currents and an external wind field are modeled. The synthetic fire model also incorporates material properties and will spread in a physically-based way. Other gaseous phenomena such as smoke and clouds can be simulated using particle systems as well <ref> [39, 5] </ref>. Kung and Richards [21] synthesize dynamic water. The water surface is modeled as a sum of squared sine waves in two dimensions, with slowly varying wavelengths. Motion is introduced by changing the phase of the sinusoids for different times. The sun is not included in the model.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the parameter estimation technique used by the authors is biased; specifically the least-squares estimator is applied for noncausal neighborhoods, which yields biased estimates [9]. ARMA models have been generalized for spatio-temporal data <ref> [6] </ref>. The generalization amounts to using spatio-temporal neighborhoods. For example, Pfeifer and Deutsch [32] model the number of arrests in 14 Boston police districts over 72 months. Each district has a neighbor computed as the average of the adjacent districts at the previous time step. <p> They were later extended to two dimensions [46]. In this context, s (x) is a two-dimensional signal where x = (x; y). This model is often referred to as SAR, the simultaneous autoregressive model. More recently, Cliff and Ord <ref> [6] </ref> introduced the spatio-temporal autoregressive model (STAR). This is simply the autoregressive model in space-time. For the STAR model, x is a vector denoting a location in space-time, i.e. x = (x; y; t), and x = (x; y; t).

Perry and Picard [30] present a modified particle system for fire synthesis. The particles are polygons made up of triangles with a common vertex, arranged to get a roughly elliptical shape. Each triangle is Gouraud shaded and can be semi-transparent.

Reference-contexts: However, a view-point invariant match function must be used when the camera is moving. Several other low-level characterizations of motion exist in the literature. Interesting motion events can be extracted from the spatio-temporal curves. For example, discontinuities of the curves and its derivatives indicate that the motion changed direction <ref> [8] </ref>. The spatio-temporal motion energy can be used as a feature [16, 3]. 17 2.3 Representation A multitude of statistical methods have been developed for spatial data; however, only a few of them have been generalized to spatio-temporal data.

Reference-contexts: Each model has the same neighbor topology but the neighbors are at different distances from the predicted location. Unfortunately, the parameter estimation technique used by the authors is biased; specifically the least-squares estimator is applied for noncausal neighborhoods, which yields biased estimates <ref> [9] </ref>. ARMA models have been generalized for spatio-temporal data [6]. The generalization amounts to using spatio-temporal neighborhoods. For example, Pfeifer and Deutsch [32] model the number of arrests in 14 Boston police districts over 72 months. <p> Unfortunately, least-squares does not have this property for non-causal models. In fact, the least squares estimates may have a large systematic bias which 22 is several times greater than the 95% confidence interval of the estimates <ref> [9, p. 125] </ref>. Hence, other techniques must be used for estimating parameters, and these involve nonlinear optimization, which is prohibitive computationally. Another advantage of causal models is that synthesis is trivial, since the model is recursively computable. <p> It aids in determining whether the data is stationary, and whether it is periodic. If the ACF falls off slowly (e.g. decays linearly rather than exponentially), the data is nonstationary and should be stabilized. Unsharp masking is a useful technique to remove some nonstationarities <ref> [9] </ref>. One approach is to median-filter the image and subtract the filter output from the image 25 subtracted off (right). (Figs. 3-2, 3-3). The ACF of the unfiltered river image falls off very slowly, indicating nonstationarity. <p> The model can be made more parsimonious by pruning insignificant parameters. The fewer parameters the model has, the lower is the variance of the remaining parameter estimates. Large models also need to be trained on more data to avoid overfitting, and require more computational resources. Grunkin <ref> [9] </ref> presents an algorithm that iteratively discards the least significant parameters while ensuring that the Schwartz's Bayesian Criterion (SBC) decreases. The SBC is an approximation to the Bayes' information criterion (BIC), which in turn is an updated version of the Akaike's AIC. <p> For static image textures, the pruning algorithm typically reduces 80 parameter models to 50 parameters while maintaining the visual quality of the simulated texture <ref> [9] </ref>. 27 3.7 Parameter Estimation There are three main ways to perform parameter estimation for ARMA models. * Conditional maximum likelihood. For causal ARMA models, equals conditional least squares (CLS). * Unconditional maximum likelihood. For causal ARMA models, equals uncon ditional least squares (ULS). * Exact maximum likelihood (ML).

Reference-contexts: When obtaining a computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MRI) scan of a brain, we would like to measure the volume occupied by different tissues or tumors. Another application is to measure the strength of bones from high-resolution CT scans to diagnose osteoporosis <ref> [11] </ref>. Apart from doing recognition and segmentation, we can also generate synthetic temporal texture sequences based on the model. Currently, computer graphics researchers spend great efforts on developing specialized models for particular textures such as fire [30].

Reference-contexts: Thus, we should filter the signal more gently. 1 This effect is due to cointegration. Series at given (x; y) locations in the volume are individually nonstationary, but some linear combination of them may be stationary <ref> [14] </ref>. 26 In fact, we need not difference the series ourselves; instead, we can let the param-eter estimation routine handle the nonstationarity. A nonstationary signal has poles on or close to the unit circle.

Reference-contexts: Below, we will review a few texture models including autoregressive models and a fractal model. For a more extensive survey, see <ref> [41, 15, 44, 40] </ref>. Autoregressive models have been used extensively for spatial data, and the most popular version is abbreviated SAR (simultaneous autoregression). Autoregressive models express each data point as a linear combination of neighboring points plus a white noise term.

Reference-contexts: This is perhaps adequate for prediction in their 1008 point data set. However, the requirements are quite different for image sequences with 10 6 to 10 7 pixels, and long distance correlations. Heeger and Pentland <ref> [17] </ref> describe a fractal model for turbulent flow. Fractals are characterized by self-similarity across scales, which determines the fractal dimension. Turbulent phenomena such as clouds exhibit fractal scaling for ranges from .16 to 1000 km.

Reference-contexts: Another advantage of causal models is that synthesis is trivial, since the model is recursively computable. For noncausal models, synthesis requires solving a system of equations, which can be done using Gauss-Seidel relaxation. Alternatively, synthesis can be performed in the Fourier domain <ref> [18] </ref>, or using Monte-Carlo techniques when there is an equivalent Gibbs random field. The disadvantage of the causality constraint is that it is somewhat unnatural when used for spatial processes.

Reference-contexts: This assumption is mostly useful for simplifying the estimation of noncausal autoregressive models <ref> [19] </ref>. 3.8 Practical Parameter Estimation The most time consuming step of parameter estimation is the computation of correlations. When large amounts of data are involved, correlations can be evaluated much more efficiently in the Fourier domain than in the spatio-temporal domain. This is done as follows: 1.

Reference-contexts: For example, water flowing slowly to the left will be different from water flowing rapidly to the right. A certain degree of motion invariance can be achieved by using neighborhoods based on spatio-temporal averages, in the same way that rotation invariance is obtained in the circular symmetric autoregressive model <ref> [20] </ref>. Unfortunately, the model may become too invariant and no longer be able to capture important differences. Segmentation of temporal textures can be done by computing STAR feature vectors for small, overlapping windows of the volume, and then clustering these vectors.

Reference-contexts: The synthetic fire model also incorporates material properties and will spread in a physically-based way. Other gaseous phenomena such as smoke and clouds can be simulated using particle systems as well [39, 5]. Kung and Richards <ref> [21] </ref> synthesize dynamic water. The water surface is modeled as a sum of squared sine waves in two dimensions, with slowly varying wavelengths. Motion is introduced by changing the phase of the sinusoids for different times. The sun is not included in the model.

Reference-contexts: For a spatio-temporal signal, we must calculate a three-dimensional FFT. The FFT is a separable computation, so we simply take one-dimensional FFTs along the x,y and t axes <ref> [22] </ref>. The run time is O (N x N y N t log (N x N y N t )) which is a huge improvement compared to the direct computation O (N 2 x N 2 t ).

Reference-contexts: If the model is large, the system of equations is often ill-conditioned. There exist methods called square-root algorithms that are numerically more stable. They avoid forming products of the data and instead try to directly obtain a matrix Q such that QQ T = A (see Ljung <ref> [25, p. 275] </ref>). The variance of the innovation sequence a (x) can be estimated from ^ 2 E : The jj is the number of data points used in the estimate. <p> In this case, the covariance matrix in eq. (3.2) is a Toeplitz matrix. The system of equations can then be solved very efficiently using the Durbin-Levinson recursion <ref> [25] </ref>. <p> The power and convenience offered by autoregressive modeling has made it popular in many contexts. Autoregressive models form the backbone of the fields of time-series analysis [45] and system-identification <ref> [25] </ref>. They are routinely used for speech modeling both for coding and recognition [37]. They have been used extensively for texture modeling of static images [27].

Reference-contexts: By allowing the noise to be correlated according to a linear combination of other values, we obtain the more general mixed autoregressive moving average model (ARMA). Mathematical definitions will be given in chapter 3. Here I would like to mention a modern variant of these models. Mao and Jain <ref> [27] </ref> suggest how to construct a rotationally invariant SAR model. Rotation invariance can be achieved by associating each parameter with a neighborhood that is averaged around a circle. They also construct a multi-scale model by estimating multiple SAR models. <p> Autoregressive models form the backbone of the fields of time-series analysis [45] and system-identification [25]. They are routinely used for speech modeling both for coding and recognition [37]. They have been used extensively for texture modeling of static images <ref> [27] </ref>. In a recent comparison of recognition performance on the Brodatz texture album [24], the best results were achieved by the Wold decomposition, whose core is an autoregressive model. 4.6.2 Limitations of the STAR model The assumption of linearity lies at the heart of the autoregressive models. <p> First, compute the STAR coefficients and their covariances. It is beneficial to use several neighborhoods at different scales, as in the multi-resolution SAR technique <ref> [27] </ref>. Collect all these coefficients in a feature vector. Next, the similarity of two textures can be measured with the Mahalanobis metric. Note that this recognition technique is not invariant to the direction or speed of the motion.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, we can use the three-dimensional model for representing color textures. A standard color texture has three channels, RGB. First, we transform the texture to an appropriate colorspace, perhaps to decorrelate the color channels, or to use a more perceptual color space such as MTM <ref> [28] </ref>. Next, let the STAR t-axis become the channel axis. Each channel can now be modeled separately by regressing on all the channels. Note that this is no longer an autoregressive model, since the relationships between the channels are not symmetric.

Reference-contexts: Many animals are blind to anything that does not move. Motion is typically the first thing attended to in most perceptual systems. For some creatures certain motion patterns trigger specific actions. For example, divergent flow activates a landing response in houseflies <ref> [29] </ref>. It is probably easier for human beings to recognize an image sequence of a temporal texture, rather than to recognize a single still image of the same texture. <p> The low-level features used must be based on the statistics of a large number of points, rather than on individual edges. This is the approach followed by many of the methods below. Another issue is the domain in which the features are extracted. Nelson and Polana <ref> [29] </ref> compute features based on the normal component of optical flow. Thus, their recognition is based solely on motion. They argue that visual signals contain more information than is necessary for recognition, and that from a functional point of view, as much information as possible should be discarded.

Reference-contexts: The authors identify a spatio-temporal ARMA model by examining the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions. Parameters are estimated using the Marquardt nonlinear optimization algorithm with a locally linearized least-squares cost function. In subsequent work <ref> [31] </ref>, they study the autocorrelation function patterns for a few low-order models. Throughout, the neighborhoods include only elements from previous times; hence, there are no purely spatial neighbors. This restriction is an easy way to ensure causality and to create spatially symmetric neighborhoods. <p> It is faster to compute the ACF as the inverse Fourier transform of the power spectrum of the signal (Section 3.8). The patterns of the ACF and the PACF for the spatio-temporal process are similar to their one-dimensional counterparts (Table 3.1, also see <ref> [31] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the parameter estimation technique used by the authors is biased; specifically the least-squares estimator is applied for noncausal neighborhoods, which yields biased estimates [9]. ARMA models have been generalized for spatio-temporal data [6]. The generalization amounts to using spatio-temporal neighborhoods. For example, Pfeifer and Deutsch <ref> [32] </ref> model the number of arrests in 14 Boston police districts over 72 months. Each district has a neighbor computed as the average of the adjacent districts at the previous time step. The authors identify a spatio-temporal ARMA model by examining the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions. <p> If the residuals look like white noise (examine the residual ACF and PACF), then the model is a good fit. 3.6 Model Fitting for STAR The Box-Jenkins modeling methodology can be applied to identify STARMA models as well (see <ref> [32] </ref>). However, the conditioning neighborhoods for STAR models are much larger and can take on many shapes in space-time. Thus, the patterns of the ACF and PACF are complex and can only give weak hints about the model. <p> The relative error is the ratio (actual-estimated) / actual value. The rightmost bar includes all parameters that have relative errors 2 or larger. an experiment shows that the parameter estimates have an approximately Gaussian distribution (Figure 4-5). This is what we expect from linear regression theory for stationary processes <ref> [32] </ref>, and it suggests that the texture is approximately stationary. The actual variance is very close to the variance predicted by the algorithm (Table 4.3). The variance of the estimates is approximately inversely proportional to the amount of data.

Reference-contexts: Hundreds of thousands of hours of video are available in digital form, and there are currently very few ways of retrieving a sequence based on its visual contents. Models of temporal textures are necessary for searching through such databases <ref> [33] </ref>. Nevertheless, there has been very little research on temporal textures in the context of recognition and segmentation. The reason is that such research was impossible only a few years ago, since video sequences contain orders of magnitude more data than single images.

Reference-contexts: Examples of temporal textures are wavy water, rising smoke, leaves or grass rippling in the wind, flocks of birds circling in the sky, or a crowd of people milling about. Temporal texture has been defined more precisely by Polana and Nelson <ref> [34] </ref> as motion patterns of indeterminate spatial and temporal extent. This is in contrast to activities, which are temporally periodic but spatially restricted. A person walking or swimming, or the spinning wheels of a machine, are examples of activities.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, only synthetic images were used in their experiment. In practice, it is difficult to track points through an image sequence, because of occlusion and noise. Spatio-temporal curves can also be used to characterize periodic motions. Nelson and Polana <ref> [35] </ref> track objects using the centroid of the moving pixels in the frame. The size and the position of the object is normalized. The bounding box of the object is divided into square cells and the motion magnitude in each cell is summed.

Reference-contexts: Our data is four-dimensional, namely a time sequence of three-dimensional volumes. 49 4.8.3 Nonlinear models Nonlinear models can represent a wider class of signals than can linear models. They may also require fewer parameters to describe some textures. We have initiated temporal texture modeling with the cluster-based probability model <ref> [36] </ref>. This is a powerful, nonlinear model capable of modeling high-dimensional probability distributions. Due to the curse of dimensionality, the model cannot handle neighborhoods of size more than 20. Fortunately, river water synthesized with only 10 parameters already looks fairly realistic.

Reference-contexts: The power and convenience offered by autoregressive modeling has made it popular in many contexts. Autoregressive models form the backbone of the fields of time-series analysis [45] and system-identification [25]. They are routinely used for speech modeling both for coding and recognition <ref> [37] </ref>. They have been used extensively for texture modeling of static images [27].

Reference-contexts: A feature vector is constructed from the motion magnitudes of the cells for several frames of a cycle. Different motions such as walking, running, and swinging can be recognized using a nearest centroid classifier. Seitz and Dyer <ref> [38] </ref> suggest that purely temporal information can be used for the analysis of cyclic motion. The variation in the period can be characteristic for a motion, and can be described by the shortest and the longest cycle times, cyclic acceleration and points of irregularity.

Reference-contexts: To create realistic dynamics, the convection currents and an external wind field are modeled. The synthetic fire model also incorporates material properties and will spread in a physically-based way. Other gaseous phenomena such as smoke and clouds can be simulated using particle systems as well <ref> [39, 5] </ref>. Kung and Richards [21] synthesize dynamic water. The water surface is modeled as a sum of squared sine waves in two dimensions, with slowly varying wavelengths. Motion is introduced by changing the phase of the sinusoids for different times. The sun is not included in the model.

Reference-contexts: Below, we will review a few texture models including autoregressive models and a fractal model. For a more extensive survey, see <ref> [41, 15, 44, 40] </ref>. Autoregressive models have been used extensively for spatial data, and the most popular version is abbreviated SAR (simultaneous autoregression).

Reference-contexts: Some segmentation is required, and will be discussed next. Segmentation can find the statistically similar regions in the video database query task. A natural decomposition of video is the layered representation used by Wang and Adelson <ref> [42] </ref>. The segmentation is based on clustering an affine flow field of the scene. Unfortunately, the flow fields of most temporal textures are very complicated, and will not cluster well.

Perry and Picard [30] present a modified particle system for fire synthesis. The particles are polygons made up of triangles with a common vertex, arranged to get a roughly elliptical shape. Each triangle is Gouraud shaded and can be semi-transparent.

Reference-contexts: bias, it exploits the strong correlations of neighbors at t = 0, which is especially important for temporal textures with fast motion. 3.4.2 Correlation Structure The autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) are useful tools for analyzing the correlation structure of autoregressive processes and for model identification <ref> [45] </ref>. <p> Since ARMA models can model only stationary processes, the next step is to transform the data to make it stationary. To stabilize the variance, we can take the logarithm or the square root of the series, or more generally apply the Box-Cox power transformation <ref> [45] </ref>. Then, to stabilize the mean, we (repeatedly) difference the series to produce a transformed series s 0 (x) = s (x) s (x k). <p> The IACF (inverse autocorrelation function) and the ESACF (extended sample autocorrelation function) <ref> [45] </ref> have the same problem. Thus, we cannot rely on them for determining model order, or for selecting the neighbors that should be included in the model. Instead, we begin by fitting a very large model. We include all parameters that could possibly be important. <p> Just like the Fourier transform, the autoregres-sive model is readily extended into an arbitrary number of dimensions, and many types of data. The power and convenience offered by autoregressive modeling has made it popular in many contexts. Autoregressive models form the backbone of the fields of time-series analysis <ref> [45] </ref> and system-identification [25]. They are routinely used for speech modeling both for coding and recognition [37]. They have been used extensively for texture modeling of static images [27].

Reference-contexts: They were later extended to two dimensions <ref> [46] </ref>. In this context, s (x) is a two-dimensional signal where x = (x; y). This model is often referred to as SAR, the simultaneous autoregressive model. More recently, Cliff and Ord [6] introduced the spatio-temporal autoregressive model (STAR). This is simply the autoregressive model in space-time.
