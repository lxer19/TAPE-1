Abstract: We present the problems associated with multicast communication for multimedia group applications, such as video-conferencing. In particular, when these applications have continuous media I/O components (e.g., audio and video) which must be communicated to a group of receivers, unique problems arise. Perhaps the most fundamental problem is whether feedback should be used in dynamic control; we argue against such reactive control mechanisms and in favor of more proactive mechanisms. We discuss a number of issues, including routing, resource reservation, error control, heterogeneity, and hierarchical coding.

Reference-contexts: There are low-cost alternatives, like finding the cheapest extension to the existing tree to include a new host, or pruning the branch of the tree that contains a departing host. After several such readjustments, however, the tree may become sub-optimal to the extent that reconstruction may be necessary. References <ref> [1, 66] </ref> discuss how to deal with group membership dynamics (in the case of multicasting without delay constraints). Similar techniques can be applied in the delay constrained case.

Reference-contexts: The discussion here mainly applies to dynamic control mechanisms. Finally, the fourth solution is to take preventive action to eliminate or minimize any reliance on feedback. For error control, this means using forward error correction (FEC) <ref> [3, 53] </ref> to anticipate errors and provide information redundancy, allowing the receivers to reconstruct the information without asking the sender to retransmit. For flow control, this means reserving resources so that receivers and intermediate switching nodes are always able to support the flow rate dictated by the sender.

Reference-contexts: As these devices proliferate and become standard equipment in personal computers and workstations, and as high-speed fiber optics provide the necessary bandwidth for continuous media networking, we expect multimedia group applications to become standard tools for communication and collaboration. A canonical example of such applications is video-conferencing <ref> [4, 49, 51] </ref>. More generally, the class of applications called groupware [12], and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) [21], enhanced with audio and video I/O, require group communication. Efficient multicasting is a fundamental issue for the ultimate success of these multimedia group applications.

Reference-contexts: As for resource hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 2 This simplified description captures the essence of this approach. However, many similar but more sophisticated schemes have been devised; see <ref> [5, 41] </ref> and the references therein. 3 Recall that ATM standardization accepted a 10% overhead by selecting a 53 octet cell in order to address other design problems. 5 reservation, not only is this appropriate for transporting continuous media, but we see an opportunity where hierarchical (layered) coding, with a separate <p> This 8 requires synchronization packets to be sent periodically to update all receivers on which packets were transmitted successfully [42]. Various schemes improving on traditional Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) techniques have been devised <ref> [5, 41] </ref>. However, the real-time requirements of multimedia applications do not typically permit ARQ solutions (at least in general settings, e.g., when transcontinental links are included in the path). Various combinations of forward error correction schemes and error recovery and concealment techniques will probably be necessary.

Reference-contexts: However, there is probably more tolerance to delay and less tolerance to errors, which is uncharacteristic of the bulk of interactive applications. Multimedia applications, and more precisely continuous media components of such applications, may be classified into two categories <ref> [7] </ref>: (1) intolerant and rigid ones, which require performance guarantees (which typically need to be provided through explicit reservations, even if the guarantees are of statistical nature and allow for occasional misses), and (2) adaptive and tolerant ones, which expect a given quality of service, but can adjust or adapt to <p> Admission control has to be introduced that determines the impact of a new multimedia connection on the existing network connections, and only admits new traffic when there is no negative impact <ref> [7, 43] </ref>. Tolerant and adaptive applications can be satisfied without explicit reservations and the necessary per packet switching overhead within the network, whose cost can be significant. Some admission control at the multicast connection level would probably be required, however, to secure the expected overall network performance.

Reference-contexts: Considerations at Lower Layers The overall philosophy of the network layer can have a serious impact on its ability to support multicasting. It is not surprising that the main available support for multicast at the network layer is in the form of IP multicast <ref> [8, 63] </ref>, and that there is little support at the transport layer. Santoso and Edida [52] address the semantics of reliable transport layer multicast. Serious problems arise in using multicast techniques when the multicast group extends over multiple interconnected networks with different architectures, or when support for multicasting is inconsistent. <p> The pioneering work on IP multicasting by Deering and Cheriton [9] is fueling some of the current protocol work, which is based on a group communication protocol, the Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) <ref> [8] </ref>. This protocol specifies how multicast groups can be formed and managed with little change to the basic infrastructure of IP. The two major changes to the implementation of IP to accommodate multicasting are the provision of IP multicast addresses and the IGMP protocol.

Reference-contexts: These have been used to 6 construct low-cost multicast trees [29, 64, 66]. The problem of finding a least delay route can be solved by running Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm <ref> [10] </ref> and pruning off the branches of the tree that do not contain any of the destination nodes. In constructing a multicast tree we have to ensure that the quality of service parameters required by the application are met.

Reference-contexts: Hierarchical coding is also very important for the efficient use of high-speed networks. The main issue for such network architectures (e.g., ATM) is the significant congestion control problems which can arise due to the statistical multiplexing of very high burstiness signals <ref> [11, 59] </ref>. A key property of any solution (that is not based on resource reservation at the peak rate of the sources) is the ability to shed load quickly without causing an avalanche of retransmissions of dropped traffic [40]. <p> Since continuous media will constitute the bulk of the network traffic, this technique can be very effective as a last resort for congestion control. Many of the proposed congestion control techniques rely on this feature <ref> [11, 40] </ref>. 4 Furthermore, routing algorithms may take into account the different needs and capabilities of the destinations by, for example, forwarding only usable components to select destinations [54].

Reference-contexts: Although efficient multi-casting has been recognized to be a very desirable service [37, 45], there is still insufficient support for it in most existing network implementations. However, there is on-going work in this area to address this problem, particularly new high-speed switch designs <ref> [13, 25, 36, 60, 61] </ref>. Also, ST-II, an experimental network layer protocol of the Internet suite [58] incorporates support for multicasting from the outset. In addition to very high throughput requirements, audio and video are usually associated with real-time interactive applications and thus present rather stringent delay requirements.

Reference-contexts: We use the term continuous media in this sense. It has been determined that a certain amount of delay is imperceptible or tolerable by humans. Various guidelines set this tolerance between 40 and 600 ms <ref> [14, 23, 35] </ref>. However, it is not just the mean or the maximum delay that needs to be bounded; the jitter, or variance of the delay, might also need to be bounded (e.g. because of buffer 1 limitations at the receiver) [62]. <p> Thus, audio and video may be characterized as soft real-time traffic, i.e., they require some kind of statistical delay guarantees, such as percentile of packets (or bits) received within the given delay tolerance <ref> [14] </ref>. A new problem introduced by the use of multiple continuous media is inter-media synchronization.

Reference-contexts: Resource Reservation For guaranteed service, once a route has been determined, the resources that made the route desirable must be reserved, so that the requirements demanded by the application can be guaranteed. For example, in RTIP <ref> [15] </ref>, a real-time extension to IP, it is possible to set up a real-time channel with quality of service parameters that specify the bandwidth required, and the end-to-end delay and the jitter that the application can tolerate.

Reference-contexts: For example, CD quality audio requires 1.4 Mb/s and HDTV quality video requires 1.4 Gb/s. Compression, particularly for video, can reduce the required bandwidth by 1-2 orders of magnitude, e.g. compressed HDTV quality video requires bandwidths of 20-40 Mb/s <ref> [18] </ref>, still a significant amount especially considering that this is for only a single video stream. The large data rates make resource considerations important despite the decreasing costs of memory 2 and transmission bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Support for multicasting may exist at the data-link and physical layers. For example, Ethernet has been designed to support multicast addressing. However, processors are often forced to perform extra processing when receiving a multicast packet since many available Ethernet controllers only support partial address filtering <ref> [26] </ref>. Another example is the ability to recognize that a packet is being multicast, and that multiple transmissions over different links, while using the same buffer, are required. New ATM switch designs [60, 67] increasingly support (in 10 hardware) parallel transmission of multicast packets over multiple outgoing links.

However, it is not just the mean or the maximum delay that needs to be bounded; the jitter, or variance of the delay, might also need to be bounded (e.g. because of buffer 1 limitations at the receiver) [62].

Reference-contexts: A new problem introduced by the use of multiple continuous media is inter-media synchronization. One approach is targeted for traditional, physical or virtual, circuit-based communications, where all media streams are bundled together in a single wide stream (for example, by appending the corresponding audio segment to a video frame) <ref> [38] </ref>; this greatly simplifies the synchronization problem (assuming a single multimedia source). However, there is a loss in the opportunity for medium specific treatment within the network and the operating system at the destination.

Reference-contexts: This might entail deciding to gracefully and dynamically degrade the quality of the received and played-back signal when resources are limited. Also, it might facilitate local processing and presentation of the signal in ways not intended by the sender <ref> [39] </ref>. Furthermore, there is an interesting interaction between hierarchical coding and multicasting. Hierarchical coding enables destinations to adjust the quality of the signal they receive each, independently and without the source actually being aware of this adjustment (of course, the adjustment is only possible towards lower quality).

Reference-contexts: A key property of any solution (that is not based on resource reservation at the peak rate of the sources) is the ability to shed load quickly without causing an avalanche of retransmissions of dropped traffic <ref> [40] </ref>. With layered coding of continuous media, when network congestion arises it is possible to drop the less important signal components without causing service interruption, and without the need for retransmissions. This should only lead to a reduction in service quality (which may be unnoticeable in many cases). <p> Since continuous media will constitute the bulk of the network traffic, this technique can be very effective as a last resort for congestion control. Many of the proposed congestion control techniques rely on this feature <ref> [11, 40] </ref>. 4 Furthermore, routing algorithms may take into account the different needs and capabilities of the destinations by, for example, forwarding only usable components to select destinations [54].

For example, graceful video quality degradation in the presence of congestion is usually more acceptable than audio degradation, and can be facilitated through the use of hierarchical coding (discussed in more detail in Section 3.7). <p> Admission control has to be introduced that determines the impact of a new multimedia connection on the existing network connections, and only admits new traffic when there is no negative impact <ref> [7, 43] </ref>. Tolerant and adaptive applications can be satisfied without explicit reservations and the necessary per packet switching overhead within the network, whose cost can be significant. Some admission control at the multicast connection level would probably be required, however, to secure the expected overall network performance.

Reference-contexts: Network Support Real-time applications provide many challenges for packet-switched networks. Traditionally, these applications have been handled by circuit-switched networks with fixed (channel) data rates, typically in analog form, with no error control, and with variable quality (depending on instantaneous information content and channel quality). The use of variable-bit-rate (VBR) <ref> [44] </ref> digital transmission for applications such as video and audio makes packet-switching the desired mode of network transport because of the advantages of statistical multiplexing. Statistical multiplexing can realize large economies of scale and can better support constant quality rather than constant bandwidth services.

Reference-contexts: The discussion here mainly applies to dynamic control mechanisms. Finally, the fourth solution is to take preventive action to eliminate or minimize any reliance on feedback. For error control, this means using forward error correction (FEC) <ref> [3, 53] </ref> to anticipate errors and provide information redundancy, allowing the receivers to reconstruct the information without asking the sender to retransmit. For flow control, this means reserving resources so that receivers and intermediate switching nodes are always able to support the flow rate dictated by the sender.

Reference-contexts: Considerations at Lower Layers The overall philosophy of the network layer can have a serious impact on its ability to support multicasting. It is not surprising that the main available support for multicast at the network layer is in the form of IP multicast <ref> [8, 63] </ref>, and that there is little support at the transport layer. Santoso and Edida [52] address the semantics of reliable transport layer multicast. Serious problems arise in using multicast techniques when the multicast group extends over multiple interconnected networks with different architectures, or when support for multicasting is inconsistent. <p> When IP multicast datagrams are sent over the Internet, they are encapsulated in IP packets with standard IP headers, and sent to sites that understand IP multicasting. There, the packets are unwrapped, and the real datagrams are appropriately dealt with. This technique, known as tunneling <ref> [63] </ref>, is suboptimal. Support for multicasting may exist at the data-link and physical layers. For example, Ethernet has been designed to support multicast addressing. However, processors are often forced to perform extra processing when receiving a multicast packet since many available Ethernet controllers only support partial address filtering [26]. <p> These routers then forward multicast packets along those shortest paths. Recent experiments using IP multicasting include the telecasting of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meetings. Live audio and slow scan black-and-white video from the meetings are distributed to hosts included in the multicast group. Tunneling <ref> [63] </ref> is used to send data over portions of the Internet that do not support multi-cast routing. An alternative network layer protocol in the Internet suite, specially designed for continuous media transmission, is ST-II [58].
