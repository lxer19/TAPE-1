Title: Connection-Oriented Communications for Real-Time Applications in FDDI-ATM-FDDI Heterogeneous Networks  
Author: Biao Chen Anirudha Sahoo, Wei Zhao and Amitava Raha 
Abstract: In this paper, we study connection-oriented service in an FDDI-ATM-FDDI heterogeneous network for real-time applications. We design and analyze an algorithm for connection admission control (CAC) for such a network. Upon a request of connection establishment, the CAC determines if the worst case delays of the requesting and existing connections can be satisfied given the available network resources. If so, the CAC allocates appropriate network resources to the requesting connection. The process of allocating resources for homogeneous networks (e.g. FDDI-only or ATM-only) may not be applied directly to a heterogeneous network environment(e.g. FDDI-ATM-FDDI network) because heterogeneity adds more complexity to the process. Hence resource allocation in a heterogeneous network needs more careful analysis than its homogeneous counterpart. In this paper, we propose a CAC algorithm that will, by proper parameter tuning, allocate sufficient but not excessive network resources to the requesting connection in an FDDI-ATM-FDDI network. We show that the system can achieve satisfactory performance with this CAC algorithm. Our approach is compatible with current network standards and hence can be readily used in practical systems. Keywords: Heterogeneous Networks, Real-Time Communications, Connection Admission Control.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Real-time communications have been studied since 1980s. Issues pertaining to meeting message deadlines have been addressed for CSMA/CD [9], token ring [19], FDDI <ref> [1, 11] </ref>, slotted ring [13], DQDB [18], and ATM and point-to-point networks [12]. Majority of these studies addressed the problem for homogeneous communication networks. However, most of the existing communication networks are heterogeneous: usually consisting of a wide variety of homogeneous sub-network segments. <p> Generally speaking, determining delay bounds has been the pivotal issue in the development of real-time networking technology. Previous work concentrate on designing and analyzing homogeneous communication networks in which the worst case delays can be bounded <ref> [1, 4, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 20] </ref>. Both shared media networks (e.g., 802.5, FDDI, and DQDB) and point-to-point networks (e.g., ATM) have been studied for real-time communications over homogeneous networks. <p> Both shared media networks (e.g., 802.5, FDDI, and DQDB) and point-to-point networks (e.g., ATM) have been studied for real-time communications over homogeneous networks. Worst case delays were derived for 802.5 token ring networks [20], slotted ring networks [13], DQDB networks [18], and FDDI networks <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. Buffer space was considered in [11] for FDDI networks. For connection-oriented networks, much of the previous work concentrates on obtaining the delay bounds and connection admission criteria for individual scheduling policies. <p> Routing in digital network for real-time applications is an interesting and challenge problem. Many studies have been reported [10]. We will adopt these solutions without further addressing this problem here. To simplify the discussion, we assume that there is at most one connection originating from a host. In <ref> [1] </ref>, it is shown that a system with more than one connection per host is logically equivalent to the one in which there is at most one connection per host. Hence, this assumption is made without loss of generality. <p> It should be noted here that this bandwidth allocation scheme is for FDDI LAN in a heterogeneous environment. This is different from those described in <ref> [1, 24] </ref>, which are applicable to FDDI-only LAN. <p> H max avai S and H max avai R are given as follows. H max avai S = TTRT of FDDI S ( S + ) (26) H max avai R = TTRT of FDDI R ( R + ) (27) where is the protocol dependent overhead <ref> [1] </ref>, S and R are the total synchronous bandwidth that has been allocated on FDDI S and FDDI R respectively. The synchronous bandwidth to be allocated to M i;j should not be more than that available. <p> The remaining question is how to allocate bandwidth (H S , H R ). As argued earlier, this bandwidth allocation problem is different from that studied in <ref> [1, 24] </ref>, because 1) we are dealing with FDDI LANs in a heterogeneous environment, where the performance of the entire network, not just the FDDI segment, be kept in mind, 2) the allocation scheme is a dynamic allocation scheme i.e. the admission decision is made as the connections arrive. <p> We argued that the resource allocation should be sufficient but not excessive. Improper allocation of network resource may jeopardize the chance for admission of future connections. From our study, it is clear that the bandwidth allocation scheme as reported in <ref> [1, 24] </ref> for an FDDI-only network may not be applied directly to an FDDI-ATM-FDDI heterogeneous network. This is due to the fact that in a heterogeneous network, an allocation scheme, that is efficient, when one LAN segment is considered separately, may not be as good for other LAN segments.

We will then investigate how the bandwidth allocation of the source and destination FDDI of a new connection can affect the end-to-end worst case delays of other connection. <p> A region on H S -H R plane is feasible if every point in the region is a feasible allocation. In this subsection, we identify such a feasible region. Proof of theorems could not be given here due to space limitation. Interested reader may refer to <ref> [3] </ref>. First, we observe upper and lower bounds on H S and H R . Define H max avai S and H max avai R to be the synchronous bandwidth available on FDDI S and FDDI R at the time when connection M i;j requests for admission.

Reference-contexts: Previous studies have shown that such an approach is efficient and effective, if proper traffic specification is provided. Similar approach was also used in the design of Tenet protocol suite <ref> [8] </ref>. The second step is an interesting one. Allocation of network resources to the requesting connection impacts the admission of future connections. If too much resource were allocated to the requesting connection, a future connection request might be rejected due to insufficient available resource.

Reference-contexts: Zhang and Ferrari [23] discussed how local deterministic delay bounds can be guaranteed over an ATM link for bursty traffic, even when the sum of peak rates of all the connections exceeds one. Deterministic delay bounds in networks have also been studied by Yates, Kurose and Towsley in <ref> [22] </ref> and by Cruz in [6]. In [2, 5], the decomposition methodology has been used to compute the delays in a connection-oriented packet-switched networks. <p> The remaining servers to be analyzed are the ATM backbone server, the interface device, and FDDI ring at the receiver's site (i.e., ATM, ID R, and FDDI R). ATM backbone has been extensively studied lately <ref> [12, 22] </ref>. In particular, the methods of computing delay bounds and output traffic descriptors have been reported in [2, 14, 15]. In this study, we adopt these methods. Analyzing ID R and FDDI R is similar to that of ID S and FDDI S, respectively.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted here that this bandwidth allocation scheme is for FDDI LAN in a heterogeneous environment. This is different from those described in <ref> [1, 24] </ref>, which are applicable to FDDI-only LAN. <p> The remaining question is how to allocate bandwidth (H S , H R ). As argued earlier, this bandwidth allocation problem is different from that studied in <ref> [1, 24] </ref>, because 1) we are dealing with FDDI LANs in a heterogeneous environment, where the performance of the entire network, not just the FDDI segment, be kept in mind, 2) the allocation scheme is a dynamic allocation scheme i.e. the admission decision is made as the connections arrive. <p> We argued that the resource allocation should be sufficient but not excessive. Improper allocation of network resource may jeopardize the chance for admission of future connections. From our study, it is clear that the bandwidth allocation scheme as reported in <ref> [1, 24] </ref> for an FDDI-only network may not be applied directly to an FDDI-ATM-FDDI heterogeneous network. This is due to the fact that in a heterogeneous network, an allocation scheme, that is efficient, when one LAN segment is considered separately, may not be as good for other LAN segments.
