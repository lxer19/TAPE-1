Abstract: UMass Computer Science Technical Report 94-66-version 2 (11/4/94) Abstract With the proliferation of electronically available information, an additional burden has been placed on the implementors of information gathering (IG) systems. The set of data that represents the best response to a query may be the aggregation of data acquired from distributed, heterogeneous information sources. In such environments, we distinguish between two approaches to the problem of information gathering that may be characterized as distributed processing and distributed problem solving(DPS). The former is characteristic of existing IG systems while the latter is the raison d'^etre for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). We examine features of problems that point to the need for a DPS approach, and discuss the benefits of viewing information gathering as distributed problem solving (which subsumes distributed processing). This approach, called Cooperative Information Gathering (CIG), involves concurrent and asynchronous access and composition of associated information spread across a network of information servers by a group of intelligent agents. Top level queries drive the creation of partially elaborated information gathering plans, resulting in the employment of multiple semi-autonomous, cooperative agents for the purpose of achieving goals and subgoals within those plans. Finally, we briefly survey current work on distributed and agent-based approaches to Information Gathering.

Reference-contexts: Simply charging ahead blindly, stopping the search when resources have been exhausted is likely to lead to very poor results. Planned activity under time and resource constrained situations is a hard problem needing sophisticated, knowledge-intensive techniques <ref> [1, 14, 38, 39] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: That communication step may alter agent behavior, but it does not represent the exploitation of constraints derived from the interdependencies of dynamically generated partial results. A system that uses this approach is the distributed version of INQUERY <ref> [3, 4] </ref> (to be discussed later), where the set of statistics used to compute globally comparable relevance rankings is obtained by pooling statistics from all corpora that will be searched. After that initial computation and communication, retrieval at the various sites proceeds independently and in isolation. <p> However, the kind of domain specificity they exploit in their content-based search algorithms and resource discovery engines is weak domain knowledge like file types, gross syntactic and structural features of documents, or keyword based attribute extraction. IG, however, is potentially very knowledge intensive. Distribution of the INQUERY system <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, on the other hand, is concerned with performance in distributed text corpora. The approach to Distributed IR currently planned for the INQUERY system (as with most other IR systems attacking the problem of distribution) clearly falls under the distributed processing rubric.

Reference-contexts: Viewing partial results as information relevant to a query opens up a rich set of possible subproblem interrelationships that may be beneficially exploited. Figure 7 shows an example that highlights the same issues in the document retrieval domain (modified from <ref> [12] </ref>). For a given query, there may be many sources of relevant information. Product reviews often exist on-line, or may obtained from publishers for a fee in paper or electronic format.

Reference-contexts: This process can be viewed as dynamically interwoven phases 3 of problem decomposition, problem solving, and solution synthesis <ref> [13, 22] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In an IR environment, we want an agent to locate information that is deemed relevant by a user. The notion of relevance is very subjective, leading to research in the area of agents that learn the relevance ranking function of human users. For example, Holte and Drummond <ref> [15] </ref> describe such an agent, called a learning apprentice, that learns from watching a user browse through an electronic library. The actions taken by a user while browsing, carry with them implicit information about goals and justifications for actions taken.

Huhns et. al. <ref> [16] </ref> present a method for learning and updating the relevance of corpora to individual topics of interest via meta-knowledge. Meta-knowledge is kept (learned and updated) by each user on the network and is a 4-tuple of the form [U ser1; U ser2; Keyword; CertaintyF actor].

Examples of information that may cause reorganization in the travel planning example are the serendipitous discovery of a major concert at Tanglewood in the Berkshires, or forecasts of severe flooding that could make travel impossible for the dates of the vacation.

Reference-contexts: For any given query, rather than performing an exhaustive search, one must attempt to locate the "best" response possible given the time and resource constraints. That is, the information gathering process must be satisficing along various dimensions like precision, quality, etc <ref> [24] </ref>. As a motivating 13 example, consider Figure 1 above. A user has access to multiple networks, each of which contains its own data sources, information servers, and servers devoted to computation. The links to each of the networks may have different bandwidths, reliability, and costs of usage.

Reference-contexts: An overlaps interrelationship says that the two agents involved may be doing similar work and can hence benefit by sharing their partial results.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, strong interdependencies between subproblems are indicative of distributed problem solving. 4 3 Cooperative Information Gathering Recent trends in information retrieval show an evolution from a relatively syntax-oriented retrieval systems to more semantically guided systems <ref> [29, 34] </ref> known as Intelligent Information Retrieval (IIR) Systems. These systems are guided by task-level requirements, rather than by just the syntax of the queries, to establish an association and retrieve information from the stored structures to which they have access [29]. <p> These systems are guided by task-level requirements, rather than by just the syntax of the queries, to establish an association and retrieve information from the stored structures to which they have access <ref> [29] </ref>. In this report we go a step further and propose a model for Cooperative Information Gathering (CIG), where a group of IIR agents are involved in simultaneous access and composition of associated information spread across a network of information servers. <p> Consider another example from [30]: "find a mechanism that converts a uniform rotary motion into a reciprocation in Atrobelovsky's design encyclopedia." The retrieval mechanism here should have a model of kinematic mechanisms. Simple keyword-based systems cannot handle such queries. Most of the models for IIR presented in the literature <ref> [29, 34] </ref> can be conceptually captured by the abstract models shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a shows an intelligent information system where an "inference shell" is wrapped around the data repository. We will apply the term information server to this combination of an inference engine and a data repository. <p> However, information gathering can exploit more than just relevance knowledge. Besides, when the number of users and the number of topics of interest is large, the propagation of meta-knowledge may easily swamp any given user. 4.2 Intelligent Information Retrieval Ram and Hunter <ref> [29] </ref> take the view that content-based IIR, as opposed to syntax-based IR, requires inference, leading to a combinatorial explosion of potential inferences. Since computational resources are limited, some method of controlling inference must be employed.

The retrieval mechanism here should have a model of kinematic mechanisms. Simple keyword-based systems cannot handle such queries. <p> Compare this approach to content abstraction with the one presented in Huhns et. al. [16] where similar information is kept by each user in the form of a set of 4-tuples - [U ser1; U ser2; Keyword; CertaintyF actor]. Rus and Subramanian <ref> [30] </ref> acknowledge the importance of data abstraction by viewing the acquisition of partial models of data as a first step in the intelligent information retrieval process that can serve to guide subsequent data acquisition. Access to resources in the environment is assumed to be neither free nor instantaneous. <p> Feedback from human experts drives KG generation in an attempt to explain and rectify failures based retrospectively on information contained in past cases and actively on as yet unseen cases. Rus and Subramanian <ref> [30] </ref>, discuss the idea of domain-oriented information capture and access using knowledge intensive modules. Given an electronic data environment, the task is to capture the data by acquiring partial models of it and to access the data as guided by the models.

Reference-contexts: The contract net framework can be used to enforce a problem-dependent organization among a set of DPS agents. Along another direction is the work on selfish agents <ref> [31, 40] </ref>. Unlike the agents discussed previously, a selfish agent places self-interest above any "global" requirements and cooperates to the extent of serving its own interests.

Reference-contexts: Information on hand can in turn serve to instantiate and actively direct further retrieval process to resolve the deficiencies in the partial data. Other work in MAS, though not directly falling under the umbrella of FA/C approach, could act as enabling technologies for multi-agent based CIG. The contract net <ref> [33, 32] </ref> is a top-down work allocation scheme among agent sets, where an agent wanting to delegate or contract out a piece of work for some reason announces the work to the agent set.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, strong interdependencies between subproblems are indicative of distributed problem solving. 4 3 Cooperative Information Gathering Recent trends in information retrieval show an evolution from a relatively syntax-oriented retrieval systems to more semantically guided systems <ref> [29, 34] </ref> known as Intelligent Information Retrieval (IIR) Systems. These systems are guided by task-level requirements, rather than by just the syntax of the queries, to establish an association and retrieve information from the stored structures to which they have access [29]. <p> Consider another example from [30]: "find a mechanism that converts a uniform rotary motion into a reciprocation in Atrobelovsky's design encyclopedia." The retrieval mechanism here should have a model of kinematic mechanisms. Simple keyword-based systems cannot handle such queries. Most of the models for IIR presented in the literature <ref> [29, 34] </ref> can be conceptually captured by the abstract models shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a shows an intelligent information system where an "inference shell" is wrapped around the data repository. We will apply the term information server to this combination of an inference engine and a data repository.

Reference-contexts: However, note that the delineation between the coordination module and the local processing module may be blurred in many of the existing MAS systems. 4.3 Information Gathering Following the lead of Oren Etzioni's software robots (softbots), Voorhees <ref> [35] </ref> describes an information gathering system composed of corpusbots and userbots. Each corpusbot serves as the system's model of a single collection of documents (corpus). The corpusbot contains all corpus dependent parameters, controls access to the corpus, and provides topic designators that abstract and summarize the corpus.

Reference-contexts: This results in the formation of a search organization for the purpose of satisfying a query. One can easily imagine Telescript servers <ref> [36] </ref> that receive queries and act as regional planning sites, either further decomposing the search into subregions or sending agents to local corpora for data retrieval. <p> One exciting aspect of the CIG approach is the availability of technology that facilitates the development of both intelligent agents and supporting structures within the environment, which allow them to interact in exactly the manner that we require. Telescript technology, developed by General Magic, Inc. <ref> [36] </ref>, provides the tools required to build an intelligent agent-based foundation for a global electronic marketplace. Telescript abandons the traditional remote procedure calling (RPC) model of client/server interaction for the remote programming (RP) approach.

Reference-contexts: Detection and the use of such goal interrelationships for efficient coordination is a hard problem in complex AI systems <ref> [37] </ref>. Now consider the case where a goal tree is distributed across multiple agents, none of which may have a complete global view of the goal tree.
