Abstract: A critiquing system evaluating a physician's management plan may produce a set of individual comments that, taken together, appear repetitious or incoherent. This paper presents TraumaGEN, a system for integrating sets of possibly inter-related communicative goals into one or more coherent messages. TraumaGEN takes account of the purpose of the messages, the situation in which the messages will be received, and the social role of the system. Preliminary evaluation of TraumaGEN indicates that it produces coherent integrated messages.

Reference-contexts: We then present our solution to the problem of producing concise and coherent texts that convey this decision-support. Throughout the paper we present examples from our implemented system, and the paper includes the results of an evaluation of the resultant messages. REAL-TIME DECISION SUPPORT TraumAID <ref> [1] </ref> is a decision support system for addressing the initial definitive management of multiple trauma. TraumAID consists of two components: 1) a rule-based reasoner that draws conclusions from the available data and posts appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic goals, and 2) a planner that constructs a plan for addressing these goals.

Reference-contexts: Thus, as one might expect in a domain where time is at a premium, actions are frequently overloaded to satisfy multiple goals. Initial evaluation and validation studies indicate that TraumAID produces high-quality diagnostic and therapeutic plans for managing patient care in both simple and complex trauma cases <ref> [2] </ref>. To use such plans for real-time clinical decision support, an interface was developed, TraumaTIQ [2, 3], that uses TraumAID's plans to produce critiques in response to physician orders. Because orders involve future actions, they can be modified or cancelled by the physician. <p> Initial evaluation and validation studies indicate that TraumAID produces high-quality diagnostic and therapeutic plans for managing patient care in both simple and complex trauma cases [2].

Reference-contexts: We felt that a text planner could help in producing more coherent and concise messages that achieve multiple communicative goals. Although natural language generation has been used in other health care systems <ref> [4, 5] </ref>, these applications have not required that several independent comments be combined into a single integrated message.

Reference-contexts: Although natural language generation has been used in other health care systems [4, 5], these applications have not required that several independent comments be combined into a single integrated message. While the HealthDoc system (currently under development) <ref> [6] </ref> produces for a patient a simplified version of a physician's "master text", it is focused on surface-level changes to the extracted text that enhance coherence (e.g. inserting pronouns, deleting extraneous references, etc.) As future systems make use of independent modules with different sources of expertise, such as a Bayesian reasoner,

Reference-contexts: Our approach draws upon work in rhetorical structure theory <ref> [7] </ref> which posits that a coherent text plan consists of segments related to one another by rhetorical relations. So another transformational rule, Combine-Similar-Intentions, finds critiques with different goals but a subset of similar actions and considers merging them into a single message consisting of segments related by a Sequence relation.

Reference-contexts: Trailing Comments. When several critiques are merged into a single message, the message may refer to actions that are also part of critiques that did not participate in the merge. Once those actions have been introduced in the merged message, focusing heuristics <ref> [8] </ref> suggest that the other critiques referencing these actions be included in the merged message as well.
