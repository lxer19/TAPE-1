Abstract: This paper presents two strategies for reducing the impact force resulting from the collision of a kinematically redundant manipulator with its environment, where it is assumed that the impact event has some finite duration. The first, an impact control strategy, involves adding torques to the joints of the redundant manipulator to impede motion into the environment with which it is colliding. The second, an impact planning strategy, involves choosing the configuration best suited for minimizing the impact force from an impact event, the approximate location of which is known ahead of time. Simulated results from both strategies are presented and discussed, and it is shown that both are successful in minimizing the impact force resulting from planned and unplanned collisions.

Reference-contexts: Walker [12] showed that reducing the instantaneous force of impact can be accomplished by minimizing the effective mass of the redundant manipulator. Zheng and Hemami [14] explored the relationship between abrupt changes in generalized joint rate velocities and the intensity of collision during an instantaneous impact event. Cai <ref> [1] </ref> provided a method for determining the impulse of a perfectly elastic collision having a duration that is less than the controllers sampling period.

The matrix in (8) equals the mass-weighted generalized-inverse (g-inverse) J H + [7]. Equation (8) can be rewritten as: (9) This equation can be used to derive joint velocity change from the known velocity change of the end-effector.

Reference-contexts: It is clear that minimizing penetration minimizes the impact force <ref> [4] </ref>, and so our strategies focus on minimizing the penetration of the end-effector into the environment. The motion of redundant manipulators can be decomposed into net and null (self) motions. The null motion corresponds to joint angle change which does not affect end-effector motion. <p> Simulation Results In this section, we present the simulation results performed on the strategies proposed in the previous two sections, and discuss the results. The simulator used for these tests was the NASA Langley Robotics Systems Simulator (ROBSIM), which was modified extensively for use in this research <ref> [4] </ref>. 5. 1.

Reference-contexts: Cai [1] provided a method for determining the impulse of a perfectly elastic collision having a duration that is less than the controllers sampling period. Khatib and Bur-dick <ref> [6] </ref> modeled the impact event as non-instantaneous, but only for a non-redundant manipulator. The theories presented in this paper differ from these previous theories in that we model the impact event as having a finite duration for a redundant manipulator. <p> In this model, we will make several initial assumptions. First of all, we assume that the environment can be modeled as springs of various stiffness <ref> [6] </ref>, so that minimizing penetration into the environment will be sufficient for minimizing the impact force. Second, the links of our manipulator will be assumed to be rigid. Third, we assume that the collision event will have some duration (i.e. it is not instantaneous). <p> Khatib and Burdick in <ref> [6] </ref> offer a similar second-order model having a x = 0 (pure oscillation). From (30), we can derive an index to rate configurations based on their ability to damp the net motion, and thus reduce the impact force.

Reference-contexts: In the remainder of this section, the physics of impact for the first case (infinitesimal impact period) are discussed by using Impact Premultiplier Diagram which is an integrated version of the Dynamic Premultiplier Diagram <ref> [7] </ref>, and in the following three sections, the second case (relatively long im-pact period) is studied. <p> ( and J T-) of J and J T , respectively, are introduced to define two undetermined paths (6 and 8).The diagram in Figure 1 describes the impact physics and also provides a natural solution of the joint velocity after impact. (For more detail on the Premultiplier Diagram, refer to <ref> [7] </ref>.) From this diagram, by the use of Path 6 = Path 3fi4fi5, we can derive the velocity change in joint space in terms of the velocity change of the end-effector in operational space: (8) where the subscripts i and f denote before and after impact, respectively. <p> The same equation has been derived by integration over infinitesimal time period in [1] and [14]. The matrix in (8) equals the mass-weighted generalized-inverse (g-inverse) J H + <ref> [7] </ref>. Equation (8) can be rewritten as: (9) This equation can be used to derive joint velocity change from the known velocity change of the end-effector. <p> The decomposition of this torque into its net and null redundancy components is given as <ref> [7] </ref>: Now, we wish to increase the net damping in order to slow down the forward progress of the manipulator.

Reference-contexts: of a manipulator and an environment [1][6][14]<ref> [12] </ref>[4]. Minimization of the impact force is important in both industrial and space appli-cations of manipulators. Past work on impact strategies has focused on the instantaneous effects of impact, where the duration of the impact occurs in an infinitesimally small period of time. Walker [12] showed that reducing the instantaneous force of impact can be accomplished by minimizing the effective mass of the redundant manipulator. Zheng and Hemami [14] explored the relationship between abrupt changes in generalized joint rate velocities and the intensity of collision during an instantaneous impact event. <p> Then, the problem can be stated as derive the best configuration q before impact, which minimizes the impulse force during impact, assuming that is given. This problem was solved by Walker <ref> [12] </ref>. If the normal vector from an environment is u, the impulse force can be minimized by obtaining the configuration of a manipulator which minimizes m u . <p> In the remainder of this paper, we propose an impact control strategy and an impact planner, both of which are related to the active dissipation of kinetic energy of manipulators for the impact period of finite duration. Because of this assumption, our approach is different from <ref> [12] </ref>. 3. <p> This type of strategy is called an impact planner, since it is a useful strategy when we plan to make contact with the environment. Here, we derive an index that involves both mass and damping terms. This approach is a generalization of the approach in <ref> [12] </ref>, where only the mass term was used. 4. 1. Basic Assumptions In addition to those previously given in Section 3., we shall assume that a one-dimensional collision task can be generalized to a two or three-dimensional case.

The matrix in (8) equals the mass-weighted generalized-inverse (g-inverse) J H + [7]. Equation (8) can be rewritten as: (9) This equation can be used to derive joint velocity change from the known velocity change of the end-effector. <p> First, we can neglect the second term in (22) with the assumption that the change in the Jacobian is negligible, since any one particular joint changes position very little during the short impact period. Second, the effect of Coriolis/centrifugal force is also negligible compared with other terms <ref> [14] </ref>. Furthermore, we note that the null acceleration term can be neglected because the only term related to this term is the Coriolis/centrifugal term which is very small. Finally. we can simplify the control torque term t, which is composed of stiffness torque and damping torque.
