Languages which can be reduced in Logspace via a many-one reduction to U ST CON , the undirected st-connectivity problem.

Reference-contexts: The similar problem, ST CON , where the graph G is allowed to be directed is complete for N L, non-deterministic Logspace. Several combinatorial problems are known to be in SL or co SL, e.g. 2-colourability is complete in co SL <ref> [Rei82] </ref>. fl Institute of Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. email: noam@cs.huji.ac.il.

In this section we show how to build a spanning forest using U ST CON . This basic idea was already noticed by Reif and independently by Cook <ref> [Rei82] </ref>. Given a graph G index the edges from 1 to m. We can view the indices as weights to the edges, and as no two edges have the same weight, we know that there is a unique minimal spanning forest F .

Reference-contexts: As a direct corollary of our theorem, we get that L SL = SL SL = SL where L SL is the class of languages accepted by Logspace oracle Turing machines with oracle from SL, and SL SL is defined similarly, being careful with the way we allow queries (see <ref> [RST84] </ref>). Corollary 1.1 L SL = SL SL = SL In particular this shows that both "symmetric Logspace hierarchies", (the one defined by alternation in [Rei82], and the one defined by oracle queries in [BALPS94]) collapse to SL. 2 Proof of Theorem 2.1 Overview of proof. <p> As can easily be seen the above argument applies to any undirected graph with U ST CON query vertices, thus, if we carefully define SL SL (see <ref> [RST84] </ref>) we get that: Corollary 3.2 SL SL = SL. 4 Acknowledgements We would like to thank Amos Beimel, Allan Borodin, Assaf Schuster, Robert Szelepcsenyi, and Avi Wigderson for helpful discussions.
