Title: Rankings of graphs  
Author: H.L. Bodlaender J.S. Deogun K. Jansen T. Kloks D. Kratsch H. Muller k and Zs. Tuza flfl 
Abstract: A vertex (edge) coloring c : V ! f1; 2; : : : ; tg (c 0 : E ! f1; 2; : : : ; tg) of a graph G = (V; E) is a vertex (edge) t-ranking if for any two vertices (edges) of the same color every path between them contains a vertex (edge) of larger color. The vertex ranking number r (G) (edge ranking number 0 r (G)) is the smallest value of t such that G has a vertex (edge) t-ranking. In this paper we study the algorithmic complexity of the vertex ranking and edge ranking problems. Among others it is shown that r (G) can be computed in polynomial time when restricted to graphs with treewidth at most k for any fixed k. We characterize those graphs where the vertex ranking number r and the chromatic number coincide on all induced subgraphs, show that r (G) = (G) implies (G) = !(G) (largest clique size) and give a formula for 0 r (K n ).

Reference-contexts: Proof: In <ref> [1] </ref>, using results from Robertson and Seymour [22, 23], it is shown that every minor closed class of graphs that does not contain all planar graphs, has a linear time recognition algorithm. <p> When the treewidth of G = (V; E) is bounded by a constant k, one can find in O (n) time a tree-decomposition (X; T ) of width at most k, such that I = O (n) and T is a rooted binary tree <ref> [1] </ref>. Denote the root of T as r. We say (X; T ) is a rooted binary tree-decomposition. Definition 15 A terminal graph is a triple (V; E; Z), with (V; E) an undirected graph, and Z V a subset of the vertices, called the terminals. <p> Finally, it follows directly from Claim 20 that g 3 = g 0 3 . 2 We now describe our algorithm. After a rooted binary tree-decomposition (X; T ) of G = (V; E) has been found (in linear time <ref> [1] </ref>), the algorithm computes a full set and an example set for every node i 2 I, in a bottom-up order.
