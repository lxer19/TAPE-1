Abstract: This paper explores the possibility of using genetic algorithms to invert seismic refraction travel time data for a two-dimensional velocity structure. The problem is usually high-dimensional, non-linear and multi-modal. Our chromosome is encoded as a two-dimensional real number array. Binary tournament selection, two-point crossover and block mutation directed by prior geological knowledge are used in this paper. Preliminary results indicate that the genetic algorithm efficiently fits the data. Given sufficient data sampling, the genetic algorithm is capable of finding geologically plausible two-dimensional velocity structures.

Reference-contexts: It is also easy to get trapped at a local optimum. Due to the large number of unknowns, these methods all need to use iteration, and sometimes have difficulty in converging. Genetic algorithms (GAs) were designed to work on non-linear, multi-modal and poorly understood problems <ref> [1] </ref>. They are stochastic, parallel search algorithms, based on natural selection and evolution. After an initial population is created, the GA starts to evolve good solutions moving towards global optima. Three basic genetic operators, selection, crossover and mutation are used to carry out the search.

Reference-contexts: From this point view, we may use GAs to solve our inversion problem. Though GAs have found recent application in seismic waveform inversion for a 1D velocity structure <ref> [3, 2] </ref>, to our knowledge the GA has not been used in travel time inversion for 2D velocity structures. In this study, we explore the possibility of using GAs to invert a set of synthetic travel time data for the velocities.

Reference-contexts: A GA with binary string chromosome is called a Low Level Language GA (LGA) and a GA with real number chromosome is called High Level Language GA (HGA) following <ref> [5] </ref>. In both GAs, the velocity is in the range from 1:8 km/sec to 7:2 km/sec, a full range of reasonable velocities of the earth's upper crust.
