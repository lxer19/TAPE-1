Abstract: We analyze convolution semigroups on a regular measure space which satisfies the local doubling property. We assume the kernels are bounded and symmetric with the characteristic small-time, volume-dependent, singularity. Then, using a weak conservation property, we deduce local lower bounds with a comparable singularity.

Reference-contexts: The method relies on three properties of the semi-group kernel: i. positive-definiteness, which is a consequence of self-adjointness (see, for example, [Rob] page 491), ii. Gaussian upper bounds, which have been derived under a wide variety of conditions (see, for example, <ref> [Dav1] </ref> [Rob] [ElR1] [ElR4]), iii. a weak conservation property, which can be expressed as a lower bound on the integral of the kernel. The only geometric property of the underlying space required for small-time bounds on the kernel is the local doubling property of the volume.

Reference-contexts: Then there exist c; &gt; 0 such that Re K t (g) c V (t 1=m ) 1 (17) uniformly for all t &gt; 0 and g 2 G with jgj 0 t 1=m , where K is the kernel associated with H. Proof It follows from <ref> [ERS] </ref>, Theorem 3.5, that the kernel and its derivatives satisfy good Gaussian bounds, e.g., there exist a; b &gt; 0 such that jK t (g)j a V (t 1=m ) 1 e b ((jgj 0 ) m t 1 ) 1=(m1) for all t &gt; 0 and all g 2 G.

Reference-contexts: The modulus jgj 0 = d 0 (g ; e) is the distance between g and the identity element e of G. Note that B (g ; ae) = B (e ; ae)g for all g 2 G and ae &gt; 0. By <ref> [NSW] </ref>, Theorem 1, there exists a D 0 2 N and c 1 such that c 1 ae D 0 (13) for all ae 2 h0; 2]. Consequently, the right Haar measure has the local doubling property (1) on any finite interval.

Reference-contexts: If d &gt; m then it also applies to almost self-adjoint subelliptic operators whenever the principal coefficients are m-times differentiable in the L 1 -sense. Our method was used earlier (see <ref> [Rob] </ref>, Chapters 3, 4 and 5) for second-order operators with real coefficients. It is based on an idea of Varopoulos [Var] for the sublaplacian together with perturbation arguments. The method relies on three properties of the semi-group kernel: i. positive-definiteness, which is a consequence of self-adjointness (see, for example, [Rob] page <p> (see <ref> [Rob] </ref>, Chapters 3, 4 and 5) for second-order operators with real coefficients.

Moreover one has the scaling relation ff t (s) = t 1=ff ff 1 (st 1=ff ) and the integrability property Z 1 ds ff for all fi 0. <p> The discussion naturally covers the usual strongly elliptic operators on R d . As a preliminary we recall some definitions and notation (see [ElR2] [ElR1] for further details). We use the notation of <ref> [Rob] </ref>. Let G be a d-dimensional connected Lie group with (left) Haar measure dg and right Haar measure d^g.
