Abstract: Single Photon Emission Computed Tomographic images(SPECT) have relatively poor resolution. In an attempt to improve SPECT image quality, many methods have been developed for including anatomic information, extracted from higher resolution, structurally correlated Magnetic Resonance images(MRI), into SPECT reconstruction process. These methods provide improved SPECT reconstruction accuracy if the anatomic information is perfectly correlated with the SPECT functional information. However there exist mismatches between MRI anatomical structures and SPECT functional structures due to different imaging mechanisms. It has been reported that if the MR structures are applied into SPECT, the mismatched part will cause artifacts. This paper describes a joint estimation approach which unifies MR information extraction and SPECT reconstruction processes to avoid these artifacts. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that the method improves the SPECT reconstruction where the MR information matches and is robust to mismatched MR information.

Reference-contexts: In practice, this type of mismatch is probable since the spin density and T 1 , T 2 distributions are not necessarily the same as SPECT tracer distribution. Some investigations have been done to accommodate this fact, such as Leahy's "functional line sites method" <ref> [1] </ref> and Fessler's "blurred weights" method [3]. To avoid fixed influence from the mismatched MRI structure, it is better to allow the line sites or region labels to vary.

Reference-contexts: For example, one can define the region labels with preprocessed MRI and define the labels which define the weights in a weighted Gibb's function as a penalty function in a penalized Maximum-likelihood objective <ref> [3] </ref>, so intensity discrepancies are only This work was supported in part by NIH Grant CA54362 and DOE grant DE-FG02-87ER6056 penalized within the same region and not across region boundaries. This is a spatially-variant regularization. <p> This is a spatially-variant regularization. This provides improved SPECT reconstruction if the anatomical structure is perfectly correlated with SPECT functional information. However, it has been reported that this type of "blind" use of MRI side information causes artifacts <ref> [3] </ref> if there is mismatch between MRI anatomic and SPECT functional structures. In practice, this type of mismatch is probable since the spin density and T 1 , T 2 distributions are not necessarily the same as SPECT tracer distribution. <p> Some investigations have been done to accommodate this fact, such as Leahy's "functional line sites method" [1] and Fessler's "blurred weights" method <ref> [3] </ref>. To avoid fixed influence from the mismatched MRI structure, it is better to allow the line sites or region labels to vary. Thus we investigate a joint estimation approach that incorporates both the anatomic side information and its measurement statistics into SPECT image reconstruction.

Reference-contexts: We choose 2 as: 2 (l) = k=1 j2N k which encourages the same labels for neighboring pixels. 2.2. Reconstruction Algorithm We apply an iterative Space-Alternating Generalized EM (SAGE) <ref> [5] </ref> algorithm for the penalized Maximum-Likelihood objective because of its faster convergence and its mono-tonicity. <p> SAGE, the penalized likelihood joint (; l) is maximized by maximizing k ( k ; l k ; i ; l i ), which is the sum of the conditional expectation Q k ( k ; i ) of the log likelihood and the penalty terms of the hidden-data space <ref> [5] </ref>. Each pixel-label pair is jointly updated by holding the remaining pixel-label pairs fixed: ( i+1 k ) = arg max k ( k ; l k ; i ; l i ) (7) with perfectly matching information.
