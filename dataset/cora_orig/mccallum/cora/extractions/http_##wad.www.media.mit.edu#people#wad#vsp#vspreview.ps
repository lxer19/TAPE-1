Abstract: This report is an attempt to assess and contrast the current state of the art in digital video and graphics processing system architectures. Although this is not meant to be a comprehensive survey, I attempted to at least quickly review most of the commercially available major architectures. At present, there is a huge amount of interest in this area, as three new markets are perceived: systems for personal (set-top) terminals, PC graphics for game and network applications, and consumer video products based around digital video disks (DVD). Due both to their proliferation, and their very limited programmability, I did not include dedicated MPEG2 video decoders and graphics accelerators limited to 2D operations (GUI accelerators) in this survey. The surveyed systems aggregated into three distinct classes, namely: A section follows for each class, describing representative systems of that class. The report closes with a subjective Commentary section, containing both comments about architectural features and a look at future scalability. Increasingly, general purpose microprocessors are integrating instruction set extensions allowing the processing of multiple small datum packed into a larger word simultaneously [1] [2] [3] in order to gain a slight speed improvement (x2 or x3) in graphics tasks. The minimal costs of these group instruction extensions (increased instruction set complexity, and slightly increased carry propagation delay in the ALUs) compared with the speed improvement when processing typical images justify the extensions. While support for group instructions alone was generally not sufficient for inclusion in this survey, they are a common architectural feature among the video signal processors discussed.

Reference-contexts: There is no difference of representation in the Talisman architecture between textures, image layers, and images | TREC is ubiquitous unless image data is actively being used in a computation. * Chunking In this mechanism, more properly identified as "virtual buffering" <ref> [31] </ref>, the rendered image space is divided into a number of equal sized regions (32x32 in Talisman), and all included objects are rendered into a region at one time. This requires a sorting/clipping stage to determine which objects to render into a particular virtual buffer.

Reference-contexts: Roll-your-own CISC ! The advantages and disadvantages of group, or vector, instructions have already been mentioned above. The other noteworthy instruction set architecture feature commonly found on the VSPs is conditional execution of each operation (first seen in the IBM 604, 1952 <ref> [34] </ref>.) This prevents disruption of the instruction fetch pipeline (long, even without instruction compression).
