Title: Trajectory and Collision Simulation of a Convex Polytope  
Author: William C. Wynn 
Date: April 22, 1998  
Address: Chapel Hill  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of North Carolina,  
Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of a trajectory and collision simulation of a convex polytope. Issues that will be discussed include, an explanation of the differential solver that was chosen to simulate the trajectory of the polytope and why the solver was chosen. Also, the issue of how the time of collisions were determined will be addressed. A brief discussion of the accuracy of the collision determination will also be included.
