Reference-contexts: and Degtyarev, Gurevich and Voronkov [9], it is explained why simultaneous rigid E-unification, or SREU for short, plays such a fundamental role in automatic proof methods in classical logic with equality that are based on the Herbrand theorem, like semantic tableaux [18], the connection method [2] or the mating method <ref> [1] </ref>, model elimination [34], and others. It was shown recently in Degtyarev and Voronkov [12] that SREU is undecidable. The strong connections between SREU and intuitionistic logic with equality have led to new important decidability results in the latter area [13, 50].

Reference-contexts: Consequently, S (x) is solvable iff T n i=1 T (A i ) is nonempty. The lemma follows, since DTAI is in EXPTIME. fi Remark Decidability of SREU with one variable can also be proved by combining Lemma 3 with a result by Brainerd <ref> [3] </ref> that states that, given a set R of a ground rewrite rules and a set T of ground terms, then the set f t j (9s 2 T ) t ! R s g is recognizable.

Reference-contexts: With two variables, SREU is undecidable already with three rigid equations [26]. In Section 6 we summarize the current status of SREU and list some open problems. 1 2 Preliminaries We will first establish some notation and terminology. We follow Chang and Keisler <ref> [4] </ref> regarding first order languages and structures. For the purposes of this paper it is enough to assume that the first order languages that we are dealing with are languages with equality and contain only function symbols and constants, so we will assume that from here on.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that the nondeterministic and the deterministic versions of TAs have the same expressive power [17, 23, 45], i.e., for any TA there is an equivalent DTA.

The proof has two parts. 1.

Reference-contexts: We write Terms (E) for the set of all terms that occur in E, in particular Terms (E) is closed under the subterm relation. We will use the following lemma. Lemma 1 follows also from a more general statement in de Kogel <ref> [8, Theorem 5.11] </ref>. Lemma 1 Let t be a ground term, c a constant, E a finite set of ground equations and e a ground equation. Let T = Terms (E [ feg). <p> This establishes the inclusion of SREU with one variable in EXPTIME. We then show that DTAI reduces to SREU with one variable, which shows the hardness part. The construction that we will use is in fact based on a construction in de Kogel <ref> [8, Theorems 4.1 and 4.2] </ref> that is based on Shostak's congruence closure algorithm [42]. 1 A similar construction is used also in Gurevich and Voronkov [27]. 4.1 SREU with one variable is in EXPTIME In the following we will assume that none of the rigid equations are redundant. <p> Clearly, it is enough to prove that, for all t; s 2 T , E j= t s , A j= t s: For a proof of this statement see de Kogel <ref> [8] </ref>. The second part is proved as follows. The number of terms in Terms (E) is proportional to the size of E. It follows by Theorem 1 that the time complexity of the construction of Q, i.e., the time complexity to partition Terms (E) into congruence classes, is polynomial. <p> The first decidability proof of rigid E-unification is given in Gallier, Narendran, Plaisted and Snyder [21]. Recently a simpler proof, without computational complexity considerations, has been given by de Kogel <ref> [8] </ref>. We start with the solved cases: 13 * Rigid E-unification with ground left-hand side is NP-complete [31]. Rigid E-unification in general is NP-complete and there exist finite complete sets of unifiers [21, 20]. * Rigid E-unification with one variable is P-complete (Theorem 2).

Reference-contexts: It was shown recently in Degtyarev and Voronkov [12] that SREU is undecidable. The strong connections between SREU and intuitionistic logic with equality have led to new important decidability results in the latter area <ref> [13, 50] </ref>. It follows, for example, that the 9 fl -fragment of intuitionis-tic logic with equality is undecidable [14, 15]. This result is improved in Veanes [46] to the following. The 99-fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable. <p> SREU with one variable is decidable, in fact EXPTIME-complete. This result is obtained by a polynomial time reduction of SREU with one variable to the intersection nonemptiness problem of finite tree automata. The latter problem is EXPTIME-complete [47]. By using an analogue of a Skolemization result for intuitionistic logic <ref> [13] </ref> we can deduce the following result. The 8 fl 98 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable. The above results imply the following main contribution of this paper. <p> We can note that, in general, the decidability of monadic SREU is still an open problem. There is also a very close connection between monadic SREU and the prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality restricted to function symbols of arity 1 <ref> [13] </ref>. 5 Implications to the Prenex Fragment of Intuitionistic Logic The prenex fragment of intuitionistic logic is the collection of all intuition-istically provable prenex formulas. Many new decidability results about the prenex fragment have been obtained quite recently by Degtyarev and Voronkov [13, 14, 15] and Voronkov [49]. <p> Many new decidability results about the prenex fragment have been obtained quite recently by Degtyarev and Voronkov <ref> [13, 14, 15] </ref> and Voronkov [49].

In some of the above results, the corresponding result has first been obtained for a fragment of SREU with similar restrictions. <p> Theorem 7 The 8 fl 98 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable and EXPTIME-hard. Proof. Intuitionistic provability of any formula in the 8 fl 98 fl -fragment can be reduced to solvability of SREU with one variable <ref> [13] </ref>. Conversely, solvability of a system of rigid equations with one variable reduces trivially to provability of a corresponding formula in the 9-fragment [13]. The statement follows by Theorem 4. fi Remark The undecidability of the 99-fragment holds if there is one binary function symbol in the signature. <p> Proof.

Reference-contexts: The problem of solvability of systems of rigid equations is called simultaneous rigid E-unification or SREU for short. Solvability of a single rigid equation is called rigid E-unification. Rigid E-unification is known to be decidable, in fact NP-complete <ref> [21] </ref>. 2.4 Term Rewriting In some cases it is convenient to consider a system of ground equations as a rewrite system. We will assume that the reader is familiar with basic notions regarding ground term rewrite systems [16].

It is well known that the nondeterministic and the deterministic versions of TAs have the same expressive power <ref> [17, 23, 45] </ref>, i.e., for any TA there is an equivalent DTA. <p> For each S i construct a DTA A i in polynomial time, like in Lemma 5.

It is straightforward to construct A in time that is proportional to the product of the sizes of the A i 's.

Reference-contexts: One conclusion we can draw from this is that the intractability of SREU with one variable is strongly related to the number of rigid equations and not their size. With two variables, SREU is undecidable already with three rigid equations <ref> [26] </ref>. In Section 6 we summarize the current status of SREU and list some open problems. 1 2 Preliminaries We will first establish some notation and terminology. We follow Chang and Keisler [4] regarding first order languages and structures. <p> Moreover, it is undecidable with ground left-hand sides [40]. Furthermore, SREU is undecidable with three rigid equations with ground left-hand sides and two variables <ref> [48, 26] </ref>. * SREU with one variable is decidable, in fact EXPTIME-complete (Theorem 4). Note also that SREU is decidable when there are no variables, since each rigid equation can be decided for example by using any congruence closure algorithm or ground term rewriting technique.

The 99-fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable. The decidability of the 9-fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality, or equivalenly SREU with one variable, has been an open problem which is settled in this paper. We prove the following. <p> In some of the above results, the corresponding result has first been obtained for a fragment of SREU with similar restrictions. For example, the proof of the last statement is based on the undecidability of SREU. The undecidability of the 9 fl -fragment is improved in Veanes <ref> [46] </ref> where it is proved that, already the 5. 99-fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is undecidable. With the following result we obtain a complete characterization of decidabil-ity of the prenex fragment of intutionistic logic with equality with respect to quantifier prefix.

Reference-contexts: We prove the following. SREU with one variable is decidable, in fact EXPTIME-complete. This result is obtained by a polynomial time reduction of SREU with one variable to the intersection nonemptiness problem of finite tree automata. The latter problem is EXPTIME-complete <ref> [47] </ref>. By using an analogue of a Skolemization result for intuitionistic logic [13] we can deduce the following result. The 8 fl 98 fl -fragment of intuitionistic logic with equality is decidable. The above results imply the following main contribution of this paper. <p> Given a collection f A i j 1 i n g of DTAs, is T n i=1 T (A i ) nonempty? We will use the following result that has been observed by other authors [19, 24, 41] and strictly proved in Veanes <ref> [47] </ref>. Theorem 3 (Veanes) DTAI is EXPTIME-complete. We will first show that SREU with one variable reduces to DTAI in polynomial time. This establishes the inclusion of SREU with one variable in EXPTIME. We then show that DTAI reduces to SREU with one variable, which shows the hardness part. <p> Given a TA A, is T (A) nonempty? The nonemptiness problem of DTAs is basically the problem of "generabil-ity" of finitely presented algebras. The latter problem is P-complete [29] and thus, by a very simple reduction, also the former problem <ref> [47] </ref>. 2 In general the following holds. Theorem 5 (Veanes) The nonemptiness problem of TAs is in P and P-hard already for DTAs. For bounded SREU with one variable we get the following result.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, it is undecidable with ground left-hand sides [40]. Furthermore, SREU is undecidable with three rigid equations with ground left-hand sides and two variables <ref> [48, 26] </ref>. * SREU with one variable is decidable, in fact EXPTIME-complete (Theorem 4). Note also that SREU is decidable when there are no variables, since each rigid equation can be decided for example by using any congruence closure algorithm or ground term rewriting technique.
