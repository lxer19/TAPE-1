Abstract: A case-study in knowledge modelling using Richard Benjamins' library of problem solving methods for diagnosis tasks [3] is presented. The main result so far is an evaluation of the practical strenghts and limitations of this library, in supporting knowledge modelling in an example application, which gives a basis for extending the support provided by the library. But the main objective is to use the case-study for research on general principles for organ-ising libraries of task specific problem solving methods. The hypothesis is that weaknesses detected in the library can be regarded as violations of such general principles. This hypothesis is supported by suggesting some principles that could have prevented most of the detected weaknesses. Principles like that are needed, if we are to develop comprehensive libraries of task specific problem solving methods, since they cannot be evaluated by testing alone (i.e. by case-studies like this one).

The criteria are expressed in terms of properties of the environment, domain, and available knowledge, i.e. what is called task features in CommonKADS <ref> [1] </ref>. The library is organised hierarchically (except that tasks and methods can occur in more than one place).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper describes a case-study in knowledge modelling in the CommonKADS methodology [13] using Richard Benjamins' library of problem solving methods for diagnosis tasks <ref> [3, Ch. 5] </ref>. The main result so far is an evaluation of the practical strenghts and limitations of this library, in supporting knowledge modelling in an example application. <p> The conclusion in brief is that it does provide significant support, but there are still many difficulties involved in using the library. Some suggestions are made towards general principles for libraries of task specific problem solving methods that might prevent such difficulties. 2 Benjamins' Library Benjamins' library <ref> [3, Ch. 5] </ref> contains a collection or problem solving methods (PSMs) (for an overview, see [2]). Each PSM decomposes a task into subtasks and/or primitive inferences, and has a control structure for controlling the execution of subtasks and primitive inferences, and for producing the output of the task. <p> A similar objective is to make sure that the library can be extended without too much change of existing methods. The principles I proposed work for that purpose as well. Benjamins proposes one principle with that objective: the suitability criteria of a method should not refer to other methods <ref> [3, p. 42] </ref>, but he also mentions the possibility of global relations between methods in addition to suitability criteria (p. 105). 6.3 Required details beyond the library scope The weaknesses identified in the model evaluation are confined to the level of detail (decomposition and precision) supported in the library. <p> An observation must include all previous observations, not just the inputs but also the outputs. 12 This call for clear concept definitions is in line with the current trend towards specification of ontological commitments. 7 Summary The diagnosis library of Richard Benjamins <ref> [3, Ch. 5] </ref> is the first attempt to build a comprehensive library of problem solving methods for diagnosis of devices, and is therefore a big step towards strong support for knowledge acquisition.

Reference-contexts: Other methods decompose these tasks further. For most tasks, there is more than one method to choose from. By making method selections for each task one finally gets a task structure where all the leaves are primitive inferences. This corresponds to a KADS-I interpretation model <ref> [4] </ref>, except that it is more detailed, and is hierarchically decomposed. The interpretation model generated in this case-study is described in the next section. The library is capable of generating very many different interpretation models. Suitability criteria may be static or dynamic. <p> This was also my experience in a previous case-study [10, 9] very similar to this one, with the same goal to generate a model of HP by reverse engineering, but using the KADS-I library <ref> [4] </ref>, and specifically the interpretation model Systematic Diagnosis by Localization. A comparison with that case-study shows that Benjamins' library is a significant improvement. This is what one would expect, since it is far more elaborate than a single interpretation model can be.

Reference-contexts: For the primitive inferences, this may be a reasonable approach, but for decomposition methods, it should not be necessary, especially since this is often required even to select which method to apply.

Reference-contexts: If we have a device with states, several input vectors are needed, or the preceding state. In more varying domains than HP, other contextual information may also be relevant <ref> [6] </ref> (like age in medical diagnosis). Since symptom detection classifies the observation alone, this background information must be included in the observation. We may call this the self-contained interpretation.

Reference-contexts: In the decomposition of the select hypothesis task, the main inference is to assign a cost to each of the competing hypotheses. GDE <ref> [7] </ref> is one of the prototypes for this. However, GDE actually assigns a cost to each observation that can be made (each probe). There is in fact no need to select a hypothesis. All we have to do is select an observation to make. <p> There will be a lot of reduncancy between self-contained observations, since many observations will refer to the same state and input vector. Furthermore, some attribute-value observations, the inputs, are not meaningfully regarded as observations in this sense. When the library is used to model GDE <ref> [7] </ref>, an even stronger notion of observation must be employed. If you interpret Benjamins' model of GDE in terms of self-contained observations, as I did originally, it does not work.

Reference-contexts: These could be based on probing or manipulation. In other applications it could also include observations based on treatment, like replacing suspect components and observing whether the faulty behaviour disappears, or reconfiguration. This task corresponds to McIlraith's work on generating tests <ref> [8] </ref>. Select observable Takes as input the set of current observations and hypotheses, and a set of observables. Outputs one of the input observables.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper describes a case-study in knowledge modelling in the CommonKADS methodology <ref> [13] </ref> using Richard Benjamins' library of problem solving methods for diagnosis tasks [3, Ch. 5]. The main result so far is an evaluation of the practical strenghts and limitations of this library, in supporting knowledge modelling in an example application. <p> Suitability criteria may be static or dynamic. The latter refer to the knowledge roles in the current state of problem solving, and so can be used to achieve flexible problem solving, which is not possible in an interpretation model (it corresponds to strategic knowledge in CommonKADS <ref> [13] </ref>). But in the model generated in this case-study, this dynamic nature of suitability criteria is not needed. Benjamins makes no claims that his library provides the support for knowledge modelling that a knowledge engineer would need in practice.
