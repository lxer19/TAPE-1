Title: On the parallelization of Geometry Independent Measured Equation of Invariance  
Author: Weikai Sun and Wayne Wei-Ming Dai 
Address: Santa Cruz, CA 95064  
Affiliation: CE Boards, University of California  
Abstract: Geometry Independent Measured Equation of Invariance (GIMEI) is recently proposed to analysis IC interconnect and packages, which enhanced the original Measured Equation of Invariance (MEI) substantially and has been demonstrated to achieve an order of magnitude faster than FASTCAP. Due to the nature of MEI and Finite Difference (FD), GIMEI is perfect for parallel computation and can have very little parallel overhead. Therefore, by using parallelized GIMEI, very "large" circuit or structures can be analyzed efficiently.

Reference-contexts: Another class is using the integral equation approach such as Method of Moments (MoM), the Boundary Element Method (BEM), and the BEM with multipole acceleration <ref> [1] </ref>. The final matrix is a full matrix with smaller number of unknowns. Obviously, the best is a method which ends up with a sparse matrix with small number of unknowns. Measured Equation of Invariance [2] is such kind of method. <p> To apply this efficient boundary truncation concept into IC interconnect and package interconnects, Geometry Independent MEI (GIMEI) is proposed recently [3, 4] and has been proven to be able to achieve up to an order of magnitude faster than FASTCAP from MIT <ref> [1] </ref>. The computational cost of analyzing large structures such as a whole chip and packaging are still too slow for the purpose of finding the signal integrity problems, no matter how fast the 3D modeling runs, if the whole algorithm is achieved by a serial machine.

Reference-contexts: The final matrix is a full matrix with smaller number of unknowns. Obviously, the best is a method which ends up with a sparse matrix with small number of unknowns. Measured Equation of Invariance <ref> [2] </ref> is such kind of method. It begins with finite difference methods, and can push truncation boundary very close to object, which results in a sparse matrix with small number of unknowns. <p> On the boundary nodes, a different type of relation has to be applied, such as traditional electric or magnetic wall, and ABC's. Mei <ref> [2] </ref> postulated the existence of the following linear equation for boundary nodes, P 3 i=0 c i (r i ) = 0, which is called MEI (measured equation of invariance), and c i ; i = 0; 1; 2; 3 are called MEI coefficients, which MEI postulated have three properties (i)
