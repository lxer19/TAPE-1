Abstract: A unified framework for 3-D shape reconstruction allows us to combine image-based and geometry-based information sources. The image information is akin to stereo and shape-from-shading, while the geometric information may be provided in the form of 3-D points, 3-D features or 2-D silhouettes. A formal integration framework is critical in recovering complicated surfaces because the information from a single source is often insufficient to provide a unique answer. Our approach to shape recovery is to deform a generic object-centered 3-D representation of the surface so as to minimize an objective function. This objective function is a weighted sum of the contributions of the various information sources. We describe these various terms individually, our weighting scheme, and our optimization method. Finally, we present results on a number of difficult images of real scenes for which a single source of information would have proved insufficient.

Reference-contexts: Note that the LU decomposition need be recomputed only when ff changes. When ff is constant, only the backsubstitution step is required. In practice ff is computed automatically at the start of the optimization procedure so that a prespecified average vertex motion amplitude is achieved <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1990 ] </ref> . The optimization proceeds as long as the total energy decreases; when it increases the algorithm backtracks and increases ff, thereby decreasing the step size. We can optimize all three spatial components simultaneously. <p> In our implementation, we take f w (x) = ((1 x)=x) 2 so that the regularization term has the same influence as the sum of all the others when P i = 0:5 We first proposed this normalization scheme in <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1990 ] </ref> , and it is analogous to standard constrained optimization techniques in which the various constraints are scaled so that their eigenvalues have comparable magnitudes [ Luenberger, 1984 ] . <p> To demonstrate the data-fusion capabilities of our approach, we supply the 3-D edges whose projections are shown in Figure 9 (d) and (e). To do so, we have used the 3-D snakes <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1990 ] </ref> that are embedded in the SRI Cartographic Modeling Environment (CME) [ Quam and Strat, 1991 ] : rough contours are hand-entered and treated as the projections of polygonal 3-D curves whose x,y, and z coordinates are then optimized to maximize the average edge strength along

Reference-contexts: In contrast, our framework allows us to directly use such image cues as stereo, shading, and silhouette edges in the reconstruction process while simultaneously incorporating previously computed 3-D data such as those mentioned above. In a previous publication <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1994 ] </ref> we describe how stereo and shading are used within the framework described below, and the relationship of this approach to previous work. Here, we focus on how an additional image cue (silhouette edges) and previously computed 3-D data are incorporated into our reconstruction process. <p> This term can be made to accommodate multiple resolutions of facets by normalizing each term by the nominal intervertex spacing of the facets. In previous implementations <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1994 ] </ref> , we have performed optimization using a standard conjugate-gradient descent procedure [ Press et al., 1986 ] . However, the E D term described here is amenable to a "snake-like" optimization technique [ Kass et al., 1988 ] . <p> However, since their behavior and implementation have already been extensively discussed elsewhere, we do not describe them any further here and refer the interested reader to our previous publication <ref> [ Fua and Leclerc, 1994 ] </ref> . In Figure 6, we show the reconstruction of a face using only stereo and shape-from-shading. 11 3 Applications Our framework allows us to combine geometric constraints with image-based constraints to derive surface reconstructions and to refine previously computed surfaces.

Reference-contexts: Given the fact that the control points are not necessarily perfect themselves, this is the kind of performance one would expect of a precise stereo system <ref> [ Guelch, 1988 ] </ref> . However, the real strength of our approach lies in the fact that it allows us to combine image-based constraints such as stereo with geometric constraints such as the ones introduced below, thereby making the reconstruction more robust in difficult situations.
