Abstract: We consider "competitive coevolution," in which fitness is based on direct competition among individuals selected from two independently evolving populations of "hosts" and "parasites." Competitive coevolution can lead to an "arms race," in which the two populations reciprocally drive one another to increasing levels of performance and complexity. We use the games of Nim and 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe as test problems to explore three new techniques in competitive coevolution. "Competitive fitness sharing" changes the way fitness is measured, "shared sampling" provides a method for selecting a strong, diverse set of parasites, and the "hall of fame" encourages arms races by saving good individuals from prior generations. We provide several different motivations for these methods, and mathematical insights into their use. Experimental comparisons are done, and a detailed analysis of these experiments is presented in terms of testing issues, diversity, extinction, arms race progress measurements, and drift.

Reference-contexts: Because of the close correspondence between the set of positions and the genes in our representation, this measure is similar to measures of gene usage <ref> (Bedau & Packard, 1991) </ref>. Table 7 shows significant usage for the eight variants, on Nim. The significant usage threshold was set at No.

Reference-contexts: This is a form of self-correction to timing that may occur during coevolution. It resembles the way in which the Baldwin effect can exploit individuals' plasticity (eg. to learn during their lifetimes) to convert difficult evolutionary problems into tractable ones <ref> (Belew & Mitchell, 1996) </ref>. Drift is likely to be an important factor in tuning parameters. Mutation rates must be high enough to permit significant random variation in a successful population, and sample size must be large enough to include degraded individuals.

Reference-contexts: Players alternate removing an arbitrary number of stones from a single pile. The player to take the last stone wins. The configuration used here starts with 4 piles, containing 3, 4, 5, and 4 stones. This configuration allows the first player to force a win with optimal play <ref> (Berlekamp, Conway, & Guy, 1982) </ref>. A simple one-gene-per-position representation is used for Nim. The positions are placed on the genome in lexicographic order: (0,0,0,0), (0,0,0,1), : : :, (3,4,5,4), where each quadruple gives the number of stones in each of the four piles.

Reference-contexts: A black dot indicates that the particular first-population strategy won the game between the row and column individuals. For display purposes, we sample generations at a fixed interval to obtain a 200 by 200 bitmap. Similar diagrams have been used to show the outcome of pursuer-evader coevolution <ref> (Cliff & Miller, 1995) </ref>. In the ideal arms race, each individual would defeat the opponents from all prior generations. This would correspond to a black triangle in the lower left, and a white triangle in the upper right.

Reference-contexts: Recently, several authors have used a tournament format based on (Smith et al., 1993) with competitive coevolution. This format yields fitness with properties similar to those given by competitive fitness sharing. This has been successfully applied to the Prisoners' Dilemma <ref> (Darwen & Yao, 1996) </ref> and the game of Dots-and-Boxes (Weaver & Bossomaier, 1996). 3.2 Shared Sampling It is desirable to reduce the computational effort expended in competition by testing each individual in the host population against only a limited sample of parasites from the other population.

Reference-contexts: This measure will be called "simple fitness" here. In "fitness sharing" a sharing function is defined to take into account similarity (according to some metric) among individuals <ref> (Goldberg & Richardson, 1987) </ref>. An individual's simple fitness is divided by the sum of its similarities with each other individual in the population, rewarding unusual individuals. Related to this is the "emergent fitness sharing" technique found to promote generalization in an immune system model (Smith, Forrest, & Perelson, 1993).

Reference-contexts: Probabilities will be derived here assuming that roulette wheel selection is used. The result should be comparable under tournament selection, but the analysis is more difficult. A similar, far more extensive analysis has been done for fixed fitness functions with conventional fitness sharing <ref> (Mahfoud, 1995) </ref>. First, assume that competitive fitness sharing is being used. The total fitness received by the host population is O, since each defeatable parasite contributes a total of 1 fitness to the host population, divided evenly among those hosts able to defeat it.

Reference-contexts: The use of standard fitness sharing with tournament selection can lead to fluctuations in niche sizes. The method of continuously updated sharing has been developed to overcome this problem <ref> (Oei, Goldberg, & Chang, 1991) </ref>, This method involves calculating shared fitness within the next generation's population, currently being constructed, rather than in the original population. This resembles the method of shared sampling used here. Continuously updated sharing was tried here with competitive fitness sharing, on Nim. <p> This resembles the method of shared sampling used here. Continuously updated sharing was tried here with competitive fitness sharing, on Nim. It was not found to be helpful. The fluctuations discussed in <ref> (Oei et al., 1991) </ref> may be less of a problem due to the presence of a large number of niches, and the fact that competitive fitness sharing sums fitness over many components.

Reference-contexts: Other factors may enter into the control of drift as well. For example, in an early set of experiments on 2-dimensional Tic-Tac-Toe, random sampling of opponents was found to require fewer generations to solve the game than full crossbar testing <ref> (Rosin & Belew, 1995) </ref>. This is surprising: random sampling may save work overall, but it yields noisier fitness information that should lead to a larger number of generations required.

Reference-contexts: An individual's simple fitness is divided by the sum of its similarities with each other individual in the population, rewarding unusual individuals. Related to this is the "emergent fitness sharing" technique found to promote generalization in an immune system model <ref> (Smith, Forrest, & Perelson, 1993) </ref>. Our method is similar to both of these methods. In the "competitive fitness sharing" (henceforth, "fitness sharing" or "shared fitness") method we propose here, each parasite is treated as an independent resource to be shared by those hosts in the population that can defeat it. <p> When many such niches exist they are necessarily small and subject to extremely low numbers due to sampling errors. Under simple fitness, there is a greater danger of extinction under these conditions than with competitive fitness sharing. Recently, several authors have used a tournament format based on <ref> (Smith et al., 1993) </ref> with competitive coevolution. This format yields fitness with properties similar to those given by competitive fitness sharing.
