Abstract The primary goal of this paper is to understand the dynamics of i nteraction in a population of individuals using a simple but representative evolutionary approach. We study the effect of different parameters, like population size, strength of selection and different selection regimes, on the performance of an evolutionary algorithm in terms of speed of fixation and fixation to suboptimal individuals. We look at evolution as a process of adaptation rather than an optimization, thus our evolutionary model is closer to the Population Genetics approach than to the most commonly used Genetic Algorithm model.

Reference-contexts: The fitness function in the experiment is the following Gaussian: F (i) = e (i -m ) 2 Here i represents the number of 1's in the genotype, thus there are 21 discrete values for the fitness function. This fitness has been discussed for the diploid case in <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]. We experimented with three different values for the mean, m , of the fitness function. The case when m =10 corresponds to a stabilizing selection .

Reference-contexts: The problem of finding the appropriate (and in some cases the optimal) population size have been discussed for certain applications in the GA literature (see <ref> [3] </ref>, [9]). There has also been research of the role of different selection schemes on GA performance [7]. A theoretical study of the role of genetic drift was presented in [4]. We will give a detailed description of our model in Section 2.

Reference-contexts: There have been very few attempts to theoretically analyze the dynamics of interaction between the different operators and the performance of GA (e.g. Holland's building blocks and schema <ref> [5] </ref>). Our major goal in this paper is to understand this dynamics for a simple, but representative system. An interesting question is to analyze the importance of different fitness regimes for the viability of a GA system and to include the role of dynamics in this analysis.

Reference-contexts: The population size at every generation is constant. The average expected fitness of the population at generation k is: k 1 F (s ) v (s l ) for every k ( 1 ) We have shown in <ref> [6] </ref> that when there is no recombination (i.e. selection alone is the driving process): v (s ) = F v (s) ( 2 ) This relation is similar to Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection. <p> the case when we have recombination with fixed rate r, the relationship is somewhat more complicated, i.e.: v (s ) = N [r (l + 1)N 2 p = s - x z = x x = 0 . k k 1 v (s)] F (3) one can see in <ref> [6] </ref> the coefficients B (x,z,p,s) are numerical constants for given x , z, p and s . The formulas above are valid with slight modifications for any single event recombination (not necessarily simple one-point ones). 3.

Reference-contexts: These two results are in accord with the results in population genetics that are due to sampling error. As described in <ref> [8] </ref> selection strength has to be above certain value for given population size, in order for the system to overcome the "genetic drift". Genetic drift in that context refers to the sampling error by the gametes - an internal source of chance effects in evolution.
