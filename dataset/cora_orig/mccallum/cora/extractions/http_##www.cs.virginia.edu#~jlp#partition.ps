Title: Evaluating the binary partition function when N 2 n  
Author: John L. Pfaltz 
Date: April 24, 1995  
Affiliation: University of Virginia  
Abstract: We present a linear algorithm to count the number of binary partitions of 2 n . It is also shown how such binary partitions are related to closure spaces on n elements, thereby giving a lower bound on their enumeration as well.

Reference-contexts: Both the function and its evaluation have been well investigated. It is described in Sloane's Handbook, [13]. A short history of the binary partition function can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>, in which Churchhouse describes his calculation of b (N) on an early Atlas computer. Our method of evaluation improves on his only because we restrict ourselves to the special case in which N = 2 n .

Reference-contexts: It is not hard to show that jP n j grows super exponentially with respect to n.

Reference-contexts: distinct minimal generators of Z:', then because X 1 :' = X 2 :' = Z:', we must have, by (3), (X 1 " X 2 ):' = Z:' contradicting minimality. 3 The family C of closed sets is closed under intersection, and this characterization is equivalent to (2), c.f. <ref> [4] </ref>. The subsets of a closure space can be partially ordered to create a lattice [12], with many interesting properties. Of most importance is the observation that for any set Z U the cardinality of f X j X:' = Z:'g must be a power of 2.

Reference-contexts: From now on, we will simply call them closure spaces. Closure operators are fairly common, although they frequently have other names, for example "convexity". The convex hull of a discrete set is an uniquely generated closure. A theory of convex geometries is developed in <ref> [5] </ref>. Convexity in graphs has been examined in [11] [6]. The "lower ideals", or "down sets" of a partially ordered set are closed. In concurrent computing, the concept of a "transaction" is a simple closure operator.

Reference-contexts: Such a closure operator acting on a set, or universe, of elements, U, is said to be a closure space (U; '), as in <ref> [7] </ref>. Readily, a subset X will be closed if X:' = X. 3 The importance of uniquely generated closure spaces lies in the fact that in discrete systems they play a role that is in many respects analogous to the vector spaces of classical mathematics.
