Abstract: A high speed filter-based coded-excitation imaging system has been proposed in our previous reports. In this paper, practical considerations in implementing the proposed system are addressed. Images of a tissue-mimicking cyst phantom are reconstructed by using filter banks of different sizes. The filter banks are established based on simulated system models. During image reconstruction, they simultaneously give scatterer reconstruction along multiple (determined by the filter bank size) directions around each receive line. Results indicate that our filter-based reconstruction approach provides images comparable with a conventional delay-and-sum beamforming image at much higher data acquisition rates. With parallel processing capability, the proposed approach may lead to a better cost-effective real-time 3D pulse-echo imaging system.

Reference-contexts: It is not clear if the same approach can still be used for creating much larger number of parallel beams. We have previously introduced a filter-based coded-excitation ultrasonic imaging system for simultaneously acquiring echoes from multiple image lines <ref> [1, 8, 9] </ref>. In this paper, the proposed system formulation and filter bank design approach are verified by reconstructing images of a tissue-mimicking cyst phantom.

Reference-contexts: This is because the filtering depth may have to be reduced to avoid wavefront distortion when increasing the lateral extent of filtering blocks. Moreover, the image quality is typically degraded (see Figure 4). A more interesting approach to achieving large size filter bank is using several (independent or synthetic <ref> [2] </ref>) wide receive beams simultaneously. Compared with the systems based only on parallel receive beams, the proposed system provides better lateral resolution with the beam space interpolation capability. In conclusion, phantom tests based on a filter-based coded-excitation imaging system are demonstrated in this paper.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction With the advent of commercial 2D transducer arrays likely in the near future, real-time 3D pulse-echo imaging is on the horizon. Compared with a 2D image, a 3D image of internal organs provides additional information to aid physicians in diagnosis, volume calculation and surgical planning <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. While displaying volumetric images is no longer a technical barrier, the major obstacle to realizing real-time 3D imaging appears to be the difficulty of acquiring much larger number of image lines fast enough to track changes in anatomic structure or moving objects within a patient. <p> Thus, parallel image line acquisition can be obtained for each transmit pulse. The major drawback of this system lies in the degradation of lateral resolution caused by using a wide transmit beam <ref> [4] </ref>. In addition, to reduce system cost, parallel receive beams are created by adding small tapped delay at the output of main delay system. Accordingly, the number of beams can be generated now is quite limited.

Reference-contexts: Wavefront distortion may happen during sound propagation because of medium inhomogeneities. The situation becomes even worse for coded-excitation systems, especially when long codes are used. To deal with this problem, on transmit we consider using much shorter codes compared to those used by similar systems based on matched filtering <ref> [5] </ref>. This is allowable since our system performance is not solely depends on the correlation properties of codes [8]. On receive we try to use the similar aberration correction techniques developed for conventional imaging to align each receive element output before beamforming.

Completely avoiding this kind of image artifacts is not realistic, since it requires establishing a system model which accounts for all the coded wavefronts leaked from beam side-lobes. <p> To enhance the system cost-effectiveness, we may use a proper apodization function to adjust block size and find a more efficient region partition scheme <ref> [7] </ref>. Since the beam patterns are typically very close for neighboring blocks, further reduction of system complexity can be achieved by grouping blocks with similar system model description together so that they can be reconstructed by the same filter bank (see Figure 3). 4. <p> Figure 6 (a) shows the image of the coded wavefronts obtained using simulation. Second, we found the directivity pattern of the coded wavefronts in term of l 2 norm (dashed lines in Figure 5) <ref> [7] </ref>. Third, we established an augmented system model by selecting coded wavefronts associated with direc tions shown in Figure 5. Note that, the image lines corresponding to the filters in the bank can be freely selected from any directions within the main lobe of the coded wavefront directivity pattern.

To construct the system model, first we calculated the coded wavefronts from image lines separated by 0:1 ffi with receive beamforming fixed at the center receive line. Here, the receive beam was created by using a Kaiser window apodization function (solid line in Figure 5 (a)).

Reference-contexts: Fundamentally, the solution to enhancing data acquisition speed is to simultaneously acquire sufficiently large number of image lines. A direct approach to achieve this goal is using parallel receive beams. This idea has been applied by Von Ramm et. al. in developing their Exposocan 3D imaging system <ref> [10] </ref>. Specifically, they designed a transmit beam wide enough to include a number of narrower receive beams centered about the main transmit direction. Thus, parallel image line acquisition can be obtained for each transmit pulse.
