Abstract: The simulator for SSN in Maisie has led to reasonable performance on sequential platforms. Parallel implementations of the simulator were explored on the IBM SP, a distributed memory multicomputer using both conservative and optimistic synchronization algorithms. The parallel implementations were used to execute two types of SSN models: smaller 2-level models which simulated both the local area networks (LANs) and the optical interconnects used to connect the LANs and large abstract models which simply modeled the optical interconnection network. The study concluded that conservative techniques were more effective in exploiting the parallelism in these models than optimistic techniques. The primary reason for this appears to be the relatively good lookahead in the models of the switch components, particularly for the optical interconnect. It is important to note that the existence of good lookahead in the model was not obvious due to the presence of cycles in the model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first byte-level simulation of a wormhole routing network and the first experimental study that directly compares the performance of a real world application at the language level with conservative and optimistic synchronization algorithms. We are continuing our investigations with the model to determine if there are specific model parameters where optimistic techniques will outperform conservative techniques.
