Abstract: Interleaving schemes have proven to be an important mechanism in reducing the effect of network errors on image transmission. Current interleaving schemes achieve a good performance in de-correlating neighboring image blocks by putting them into packets that are far distant apart from each other in the transmission sequence, but they fail in de-correlating the information inside the blocks. In this paper, we propose two interleaving schemes called Triangular and Pixel, where the de-correlation process is applied not only at a block level, but also at a pixel or coefficient level (that is, on the information within the blocks) in the compressed domain. In the triangular scheme, the lower dct triangular matrix of one block and the upper dct triangular matrix of the next block are mixed together to form a new block, which is put far apart from its counterpart block. In the pixel scheme, the decorrelation is achieved via a k-way shu*e of pixels among the blocks and using the spatial properties of different space filling curves, k depends on the total number of blocks in the image. Our results show that despite of decorrela-tion of coefficients in the triangular interleaving scheme the compression ratio is quiet good oscilating between 94% to 98% of the JPEG standard compression, and between 84% to 92% for the pixel scheme. We also show that when comparing with the existing interleaving schemes, our techniques provide improved image quality and low mean square error in transmitted images in the presence of random as well as burst packet losses in networks.

Reference-contexts: Under this assumption, EC techniques attempt to fill in the corrupted area (lost block) by using information from adjacent error free blocks. When the lost area represents a large portion of the image information, the reconstruction process becomes inadequate <ref> [1] </ref>. In order to avoid this kind of situations, spatially correlated information has to be protected against random and burst packet loss by implicitly spreading the loss over relatively distant portions of the transmitted image rather than concentrating it in the same region.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, packet losses are correlated and might occur in burst. Correlated losses 1 decrease effectiveness of the most of the existing error concealment techniques. For a detailed discussion on the packet loss and bit error behavior for the Internet, please refer to <ref> [2] </ref>. For ATM networks, the main source of error is cells lost due to buffer overflow [3]. In existing interleaving schemes, adjacent blocks (which in general are highly correlated) are inserted into different packets, so that packet information and information among successive packets is as much de-correlated as possible.

Reference-contexts: JPEG standard compression was used as a basis to analyze the effect the proposed interleaving schemes on compression ratio. For the generation of the quantization tables, we used the approach proposed by <ref> [4] </ref>: Q (i; j) = 1 + [(1 + I + j) fl Quality] where Quality specifies the quality factor, and its recommended range is from 1 (lowest compression) to 25 (highest compression).

Reference-contexts: Several approaches have been proposed in order to recover or at least ameliorate the effect of packet loss during data transmission <ref> [6] </ref>, one of the most important is Error Concealment (EC) with block interleaving. EC based techniques exploit the fact that neighboring blocks are highly correlated. Under this assumption, EC techniques attempt to fill in the corrupted area (lost block) by using information from adjacent error free blocks.
