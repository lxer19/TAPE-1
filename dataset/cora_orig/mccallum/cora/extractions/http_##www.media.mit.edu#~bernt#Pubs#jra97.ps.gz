Abstract: This article develops an analogy between object recognition and the transmissions of information through a channel. This analogy is based on the statistical representation of the appearance of 3D objects by several multidimensional receptive field histograms. The analogy between transmission of information and object recognition provides a means to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of individual receptive field functions, and to predict the performance of the object recognition process using receptive field histograms. Transinformation also provides a quantitative measure of the discrimination provided by each viewpoint, thus permitting the determination of the most discriminant viewpoints. As an application, the article develops an active object recognition algorithm which is able to resolve ambiguities inherent in a single-view recognition algorithm. The algorithm incorporates 3D information of an objects appearance entirely based on 2D measurements in images of the object.

Reference-contexts: In order to obtain the correct histogram of an arbitrary rotation of the object we have to take several images of the object. But in order to reduce the number of images we employed in [7,8] the steerability of the Gaussian derivatives <ref> [1] </ref> to image plane rotation and scale. Using this property of Gaussian derivatives one has to consider only two degrees of rotations.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the analysis of the robustness of the employed local characteristics to such changes is very important. As mentioned above, it is relatively difficult to model partial occlusion in a general way. Hornegger and Niemann <ref> [2] </ref> propose to model partial occlusion as a particular object: the background. By introducing a probability for the background which is related to the observed portion of the object the probability of the presence of an object in the image can be calculated. <p> Horneg-ger and Niemann <ref> [2] </ref> use parameterized mixtures of multivariate Gaussian distributions including a feature transform. These statistical models consider the statistical behavior of features, feature matching, as well as the projection from the model into the image space.

Reference-contexts: Probably the most tempting way to reduce the number of free parameters is to choose local characteristics which are invariant in relation to the different parameters. Such invariant features are used by many researchers <ref> [3] </ref> and applied successfully in various ways. Unfortunately the obtained invariants are very restrictive to certain types of objects. Furthermore these invariants usually need the calculation of high order derivatives which are in general relatively unstable.

Reference-contexts: Experiments on the Columbia image database (100 objects from 72 viewpoints, <ref> [4] </ref>) show that the proposed algorithm is able to resolve nearly all ambiguities which are inherent in a single-view recognition algorithm. By integrating multiple views and in particular the most discriminant views of objects, the algorithm uses not only 2D information but also 3D information of objects. <p> The experiments are based on the Columbia image database of 100 objects <ref> [4] </ref>, which contains 7200 image, 72 for each object (originally the database contains color images which we converted to grey scale images). The images are taken under controlled lightening conditions in front of a black background. Figure 3 shows some of the 100 objects.

Reference-contexts: Experiments showed that a relatively small portion of the image is sufficient in order to recognize objects of a database of 100 objects. The 2 -statistics for the comparison of two histograms is defined by <ref> [5] </ref>: 2 (D (M jI); H (M jo n ; r i ; s m ) = k 2 (4) where D (M jI) is the histogram of the test-image I of an (unknown) object and H (M jo n ; r i ; s m ) is a histogram of

Reference-contexts: The only assumption for the validity of the analogy is that the 6 "messages" (or measurements) m k obtained from the object are member of a certain finite measurement set M . The following section 3.1 summarizes basic concepts from information theory (see for example <ref> [6] </ref>) and gives a first interpretation of the concepts in the context of object recognition. The reader familiar with information theory should move directly to section 3.2 which discusses in more detail the interpretation of different entropies in the context of object recognition.

Reference-contexts: We concluded from the experiments that, because of the robustness of multidimensional receptive field histograms to view point changes, already a small number of histograms are sufficient in order to obtain high recognition rates. 2.1 Histogram matching for object recognition The paper <ref> [7] </ref> experimentally evaluates different histogram matching function for the recognition of objects. This section describes the 2 -statistics, which has been shown to be the most reliable (in terms of recognition and robustness) in most of the experiments.

Reference-contexts: The recognition process therefore estimates not only the object's label and its pose but also the portion of occlusion, which makes the recognition process elegant but relatively time consuming. In <ref> [8] </ref> we have proposed a probabilistic object recognition approach which is able to recognize objects by the observation of only a small portion of the object. This makes the recognition process robust to partial occlusion. <p> This section describes the 2 -statistics, which has been shown to be the most reliable (in terms of recognition and robustness) in most of the experiments. Histogram matching is not the only possibility to use the developed statistical representation for objects. In <ref> [8] </ref> we have developed a probabilistic object recognition approach which is based on single measurements in the image and which is entirely based on multidimensional receptive field histograms. <p> Dx-Dy-Lap finally corresponds to a three-dimensional measurement vector of the first derivatives in x and ydirection and the Laplace operator (we use the usual definition of Gaussian derivatives which we describe in <ref> [8] </ref>). In figure 1 one can see that the choice of the measurement set plays an important role for the transinformation of the recognition process. The graph shows a significant increase of the transinformation for the three-dimensional measurement set Dx-Dy-Lap relative to the two-dimensional measurement sets Dx-Dy and Mag-Lap.
