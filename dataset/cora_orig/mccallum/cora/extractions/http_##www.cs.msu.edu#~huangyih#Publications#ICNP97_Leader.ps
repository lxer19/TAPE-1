Title: Group Leader Election under Link-State Routing

Abstract: In this work, we place the problem of group leader election in a context "inside the network," meaning that participants in the election process are network switches/routers, rather than hosts. A robust solution to the problem, called the Network Leader Election (NLE) protocol, is proposed for use in networks based on link-state routing (LSR). The protocol is robust, for it achieves leadership consensus in the presence of adverse events, such as leader failures and network partitioning. The correctness of the protocol can be proved formally. A simulation study reveals that the NLE protocol incurs low overhead in handling leader failures and in group creation. In addition, it is shown how important network functions, including hierarchical routing, address resolution, and multicast core management, can benefit from the NLE protocol.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we focus on three examples. First, in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks and other hierarchical networks, switches in a low-level subnetwork (called a routing domain) select a switch to represent the domain in the next routing level <ref> [3] </ref>; a solution to this domain leader election problem supports routing operations within the network. <p> Based on received advertisements, each switch locally maintains a complete topology image of the network, which it uses to make routing decisions. Prominent LSR protocols include the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol [8] for use in the Internet and the Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI) standard <ref> [3] </ref> for ATM networks. The proposed NLE protocol extends LSR to include group-leader binding LSAs, which are used by group members to advertise their choice of leader. Upon receiving such an LSA, other switches in the network either accept this selection, or choose and advertise an alternative leader. <p> In order to apply such protocols to larger networks, a routing hierarchy can be introduced. The combination of an LSR protocol and a routing hierarchy has been adopted by the ATM PNNI standard <ref> [3] </ref>, as discussed next. 2.2 Domain Leader Election in ATM Networks ATM is a connection-oriented communication technology that relays small fixed-size cells in hardware. As a telecommunications standard, ATM adopts a hierarchical routing method to cope with the routing complexities of networks that are national or even global in scope. <p> Within each domain on this path, intra-domain routing determines a path that comprises a series of switches that connect the two domains on either side. In the ATM Private Network-Network Interface (PNNI) standard <ref> [3] </ref>, switches in a domain use LSR to perform intra-domain routing, and elect a leader switch to represent the domain in inter-domain routing. The domain leader election protocol defined in the current ATM standard [3] is LSR-based. <p> In the ATM Private Network-Network Interface (PNNI) standard <ref> [3] </ref>, switches in a domain use LSR to perform intra-domain routing, and elect a leader switch to represent the domain in inter-domain routing. The domain leader election protocol defined in the current ATM standard [3] is LSR-based. In this protocol, each switch maintains two election-related states: leader priority and preferred leader. The former is manually configured to determine the rank of the switch. <p> Details are omitted here due to space limitations, but can be found in a companion technical report [10]. 4 Performance Evaluation In this section, we investigate the performance of the NLE protocol in handling leader failures. Specifically, the NLE protocol is compared against the ATM domain leader election protocol <ref> [3] </ref>. In our simulations, networks comprising up to 400 switches were used. For each network size, 40 graphs were generated randomly, and two simulation sessions were conducted on each graph. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the graphs generated.

Reference-contexts: Second, many address-mapping services, such as the mapping between group addresses and member addresses <ref> [4] </ref> and the mapping between network addresses and link-layer addresses [5], use a central server approach; a solution to the server assignment problem selects a leader to undertake the server responsibilities. <p> Rather, ATM supports multicasting through point-to-multipoint unidirectional virtual channels, which require the sender to explicitly establish a connection to each destination. One approach to this problem is to use a Multicast Address Resolution Server (MARS) <ref> [4] </ref>, a central server that acts as a registry, associating IP multicast group identifiers with the ATM interfaces representing the members of the groups. <p> As a centralized solution, however, the potential for MARS failure is an important issue. (a) NLE bandwidth. (b) ATM bandwidth. The approach described in <ref> [4] </ref> is to manually configure nodes with the addresses of one or more backup MARS nodes that they can contact in descending order of preference. An alternative method is to use an election protocol, such as NLE, to "automatically" handle MARS failures and, just as important, accommodate network partitions.

In our simulations, networks comprising up to 400 switches were used. <p> Theorem 1 Given the flooding diameter T f of a network (the worst-case time to finish a flooding operation), the convergence time for group creation under NLE is less then 2T f , assuming that no network component failures occur during group creation. Proof: See <ref> [10] </ref>. 2 To investigate the number of binding LSAs produced by group creation, we simulated the creation periods of multicast sessions with M participants. The arrival time of each participant is normally distributed with mean zero, the predetermined startup time of the group.

Reference-contexts: This list is usually maintained by a local membership management protocol, such as the IGMP <ref> [11] </ref>. Since every switch must send a JOIN-REQUEST to a newly elected MARS, reconstruction of member lists at the MARS can be implemented by augmenting each JOIN-REQUEST message from switch x to include a copy of M x .

Reference-contexts: We assume that a core election is held whenever a multicast group is created (that is, when the first member joins), and that a new core is elected if the current core fails. Regarding the core/leader selection policy, we can assume that the default is the random member policy <ref> [12] </ref>: whenever a member is required to select and advertise a core node (including group creation time), the member simply recommends itself. A number of other core selection policies are discussed in [12] and could be incorporated into the NLE protocol. <p> Regarding the core/leader selection policy, we can assume that the default is the random member policy <ref> [12] </ref>: whenever a member is required to select and advertise a core node (including group creation time), the member simply recommends itself. A number of other core selection policies are discussed in [12] and could be incorporated into the NLE protocol. As with the applications discussed earlier, the mutual consensus property of the NLE protocol enables arbitrary multicast groups to handle network partitions and re-unifications.

Reference-contexts: As with the applications discussed earlier, the mutual consensus property of the NLE protocol enables arbitrary multicast groups to handle network partitions and re-unifications. The maintenance of the leader binding of every active group at every switch in a network may raise the concern of scalability. In <ref> [13] </ref>, we describe another core-management method that addresses this issue by using the NLE protocol to select a central server to maintain the leader bindings of all active groups.
