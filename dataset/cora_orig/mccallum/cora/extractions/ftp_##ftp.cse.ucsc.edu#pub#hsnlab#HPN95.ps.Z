Abstract: We describe a new algorithm for rate allocation within the individual switches of an ATM network implementing a rate-based congestion control algorithm for Available Bit-Rate (ABR) traffic. The algorithm performs an allocation in fi(1) time, allowing it to be applied to ATM switches supporting a large number of virtual circuits. When the total available capacity or the requests of the individual connections change, the algorithm converges to the max-min allocation. Results from simulations using ATM sources show that the algorithm provides close to ideal throughput and converges to the max-min fair allocation rapidly when the available bandwidth or the individual requests change.

Reference-contexts: The Available Bit-Rate (ABR) service class was defined for the support of best-effort applications that may require a minimum-bandwidth guarantee <ref> [Giroux, 1995] </ref>. This service class allows applications to fully utilize the available bandwidth in the network by adjusting their instantaneous transmission rates to the available capacity.

Reference-contexts: The ATM Forum Traffic Management Committee recently chose a rate-based congestion control framework to satisfy this objective <ref> [Bonomi, 1995] </ref>. With the explicit-rate option for the ATM Forum congestion control scheme, the source of each connection periodically transmits a special resource management (RM) cell. The RM cell specifies the bandwidth requested by the connection, as well as the current transmission rate of the source of the connection. <p> Note that these loss rates are highly exaggerated because of the greedy source policy assumed in our simulations. In practice, the sources increase their rates only gradually when the returned RM cell indicates an increase in its allocation <ref> [Bonomi, 1995] </ref>, resulting in substantially lower loss rates than those in Figures 4 and 5. 5 CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm for rate allocation within the individual switches of an ATM network implementing a rate-based congestion control algorithm for ABR traffic.

Reference-contexts: Such an algorithm for rate allocation in packet-switched networks was described by Charny <ref> [Charny, 1994] </ref>. Upon convergence, the allocations computed by this algorithm have been shown to satisfy max-min fairness. The algorithm, however, requires examining the state of other active connections on the receipt of each RM cell, making its worst-case execution time O (N), where N is the number of active connections. <p> We conclude the paper in Section 5 with a summary of the results and directions for future work. 2 DESCRIPTION OF THE ALGORITHM The rate-based congestion control framework, on which our algorithm depends, is similar to the one described by Charny <ref> [Charny, 1994] </ref>. The source of each connection requests a specific amount of bandwidth to be allocated to the connection by the switches on its path to the destination. The request is carried by special RM cells transmitted periodically by the source. <p> Perhaps its most important merit is the implementation complexity. The complexity of fi (1) makes it attractive for use in ATM switches supporting very large number of virtual channels. This improves upon the scheme proposed by Charny <ref> [Charny, 1994] </ref>, which has an asymptotic complexity of O (N ) where N is the number of active connections. When the individual requests i and the available bandwidth are steady, the algorithm can be shown to converge to a max-min fair allocation in finite time [Kalampoukas, 1995].

Reference-contexts: In addition, the variables maintained by the algorithm must be updated when a new connection is opened, an existing connection closes, or when the available bandwidth B (t) changes. The complete pseudocode of the algorithm can be found in <ref> [Kalampoukas, 1995] </ref>. 3 PROPERTIES OF THE ALGORITHM The proposed algorithm has some important properties making it especially attractive for application to ATM and to packet switching networks in general. Perhaps its most important merit is the implementation complexity. <p> When the individual requests i and the available bandwidth are steady, the algorithm can be shown to converge to a max-min fair allocation in finite time <ref> [Kalampoukas, 1995] </ref>. In addition, results from simulations show that the algorithm is responsive to network changes.

Reference-contexts: In the future we plan to study the dynamic behavior of the algorithm in more complex network configurations and with more complex source policies. We are also investigating the possibility of implementing the algorithm in a hardware simulation testbed <ref> [Varma, 1995] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Rate allocation within a switch must be performed according to some fairness criterion, so that the total available bandwidth on the outbound link is divided among the connections sharing the link fairly. A commonly used fairness criterion is max-min fairness <ref> [Bertsekas, 1992, Ramakrishnan, 1987] </ref>. Let 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; N be the requests of individual connections sharing the link and A 1 ; A 2 ; : : : ; A N be the allocation produced by the algorithm.
