Reference-contexts: Progress statements are composed by induction or some other standard technique to prove more complex liveness properties. 10 12. Mechanization 2 The theorems presented here have been verified by an automated theorem prover called the Boyer-Moore Prover <ref> [Boyer & Moore 79] </ref> An automated theorem prover is a program that will accept a statement as a theorem if and only if it can prove the statement from its axioms and from previously accepted theorems, using its inference rules.
