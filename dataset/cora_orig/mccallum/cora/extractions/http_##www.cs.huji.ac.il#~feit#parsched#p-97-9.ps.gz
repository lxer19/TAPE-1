Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to solve the problem of job scheduling for parallel processing in heterogeneous systems. The optimization goals are: (i) minimum total execution time including communication costs and (ii) shortest response time for all jobs. We introduce a classification for the given scheduling problem by the heterogeneity of the systems, from the view of the schedulers eyes. Then, according to this analysis, a new scheduling strategy for socalled Strictly-Heterogeneous systems is proposed. The key idea of the new approach is the use of the Hungarian method. which provides a quick and objective-oriented search for the best schedule by the given optimization criteria. In addition, by modifying this method into socalled Objective-Oriented Algorithm (OOA), the scheduling time is decreased to O(n(E+nlogn)) for finding the real optimum schedule. The simulation results show us that OOA provides better solution quality while scheduling time is less than the existing methods.

Reference-contexts: The scale of the problem is Rp = M M N ( )! - In socalled Completely-Heterogeneous systems, there is no processing requirement but either the resources and the jobs are different <ref> [2] </ref>. In this case, the complexity of the job scheduling problem is the same as the previous one, but the scale is different with Ri = Rp = M M N ! ! , In socalled Strictly-Heterogeneous systems, the resources and the jobs can also be different. <p> Focus on the minimization of communication costs [6] (e.g. using critical path in clustering algorithms [19]). Focus on other parameters (e.g. response time or other time constraints in the Real-time systems <ref> [2] </ref>). After choosing criteria, the optimization can be carried out in two ways: Through local minimization [2],[14]. This is simpler than the next way and it requires less information (in local scale). However, because it is local, it has to be carried out several times during a scheduling cycle.

Reference-contexts: That is why we name the algorithm Objective-Oriented (OOA). The selection of the Hungarian method is not by chance but is based on a careful investigation which is studied in <ref> [12] </ref>. Scheduling Strategy for dealing with solution quality: Now we have to determine the optimization criterion and the scale of optimization area. n Heterogeneous systems usually are distributed. Therefore, we think that it is necessary to consider communication costs in scheduling for such systems. <p> The time complexity for the Hungarian method is O (n 3 ), plus the time complexity for forming matrix JR, which is n 2 , thus the time complexity for OOA is O (n 3 +n 2 ). However, if we use algorithm AMA which is described in <ref> [12] </ref> for searching Vop on SL we have time complexity for OOA as O (n (E+nlogn)+n 2 ), where E is the maximum number of zero assignments on SL in the matrix JR, therefore n E n 2 . <p> The new approach, using the Hungarian method, provides a quick and objective-oriented search for the best schedule by two optimization goals: (i) minimum total execution time including communication costs and (ii) shortest response time for all jobs. In addition, using the modified algorithm (which has been provided in <ref> [12] </ref>) for this method, the solving time is decreased to O (n (E+nlogn)). Note that this time complexity is for finding the exact solution, the real optimum schedule by the given optimization criteria. Besides, as is shown in the simulation results, the actual scheduling time in practice is almost linear. <p> Note that this time complexity is for finding the exact solution, the real optimum schedule by the given optimization criteria. Besides, as is shown in the simulation results, the actual scheduling time in practice is almost linear. The explanation of this fact is that the modified algorithm <ref> [12] </ref> which is applied for searching Vop on current SL (in 4.3.) is a very good fit for this kind of searching.
