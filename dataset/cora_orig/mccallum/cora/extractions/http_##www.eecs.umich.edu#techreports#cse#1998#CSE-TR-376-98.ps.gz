Abstract: A fundamental problem inhibiting the wide acceptance of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in the Internet is the lack of a mechanism that provides scalable certificate revocation. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism called Windowed Revocation. In windowed revocation, certificate revocation is announced for short periods in periodic Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs). Due to the assurances provided by the protocol over which certificates are retrieved, we bound the amount of time that any certificate is cached by users. Thus, we can limit the announcement of revocation only to the time in which the certificate may be cached; not until its expiration. Because the time in which certificate are announced is short, CRLs are similarly small. By limiting the size of CRLs, we are able to integrate other mechanisms that increase the scalability of the PKI. One such mechanism is the use of pushed CRLs using multicast. We include a proof of the correctness of our approach.

Reference-contexts: The only scenario in which the keyserver will not have the most recent CRL is when the enterprise root experiences a process or communication failure. We note the possibility of keyserver supported Freshness CRLs. CAs supporting Freshness CRLs <ref> [AZ98] </ref> generate CRLs at differing frequencies. Users retrieve the CRL with a publication rate commensurate with their needs. In extending this approach, a keyserver may support several announcement groups with different CRL publication rates. Finally, we consider the special case of keyserver certificates revocation. <p> Due to the long lifetimes of certificates, the size of these lists made CRL distribution difficult. Several approaches to reducing the size the CRLs have been proposed <ref> [AZ98, HFPS98] </ref>, many of which have been included in the IETF Public Key Infrastructure Working Group (PKIX) draft standards. The X.509 v3 certificate format standard [HFPS98] provides extensions in which new mechanisms can be incorporated. <p> However, unlike CRLs in windowed revocation, delta CRLs continually increase in size between base CRLs. Furthermore, PKIs using delta CRLs are required to acquire, validate, and cache the potentially large base CRLs. In systems that use freshness CRLs <ref> [AZ98] </ref>, delta CRLs are generated at multiple rates. Verifiers retrieve the CRLs at a rate commensurate with their security requirements. The frequency of freshness CRLs is determined by the CA, and thus limits the verifier to a set of predetermined guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Detection of the revocation of cached certificates is described in Section 3.3. While in the preceding architectural overview we have described each CA as a single entity, in practice it consists of two components: a CA 3 and a directory service <ref> [BAN90] </ref>. The CA performs the mission critical duties of certificate signing and CRL generation, communicating only with the directory service. The directory service acts as the distribution point for certificates and CRLs.
