Title: Abstract  
Abstract: Studies for distributed applications have demonstrated that application quality in distributed computing is strongly dependent on the quality of the underlying communication system. Besides performance characteristics the reliability properties of a communication system are playing a predominant role with regard to the quality achievable from applications point of view. In this paper we study distributed applications with video communication via lossy communication systems. We develop analytical models reecting transmission of MPEG coded video streams both without and with forward error correction (FEC). These models allow us to determine the optimum amount of redundancy to be used for FEC when communicating via constant bit rate connections. We conclude that FEC algorithms offer the potential for high quality-of-service even in the case of using a communication system with low quality.

Reference-contexts: The models presented by us reect transmission of MPEG coded video streams [LeG 91] and they are still analytically tractable. We assume that FEC is achieved using PET algorithm <ref> [ABE 94] </ref>. The paper comprises some rather comprehensive case studies applying our models. These series of experiments demonstrate impressively how significant even a very low QoS (related to data losses) offered by a communication network may be ameliorated by an adequately chosen FEC on Application Layer. <p> For recent approaches to achieve forward error control in video communication, cf. e.g. <ref> [ABE 94] </ref>, [ILD 94], [ILD 95], [KMS 95], [RiR 95]. <p> As what concerns FEC we will on the one part consider an FEC algorithm without any prioritization of data units transmitted (could also be seen as one level of priority). On the other part, however, our models reect the PET coding algorithm <ref> [ABE 94] </ref> as developed at International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), which allows one to choose priorities in a very exible way for the different types of data units transmitted. <p> The PET algorithm will be introduced in this paper only to the extend as it is necessary to understand our analytical models as well as the case studies based on those models. The reader interested in details on PET will find such in-depth information e.g. in <ref> [ABE 94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: both cases, (a) and (b), we assume that the (physical or virtual) circuit used represents a constant bit rate (CBR) connection between sender and receiver, such as it is the case e.g. in communication networks with leased lines or with circuit-switching but also in some of the standardized ATM variants <ref> [DeP 96] </ref>. Moreover we assume, that the (physical or virtual) circuit used will lose or corrupt data units during their transmission. In case of corrupted data being delivered we suppose that, as a conse quence of real-time communication requirements retransmission of the data will not be acceptable.

Reference-contexts: The models presented by us reect transmission of MPEG coded video streams <ref> [LeG 91] </ref> and they are still analytically tractable.

The paper comprises some rather comprehensive case studies applying our models. <p> As compression algorithm we want to assume the MPEG algorithm <ref> [LeG 91] </ref>, in particular MPEG-1, which in recent times has achieved considerable importance in audio/ video communication.

P-frames; neighbouring here means preceeding or following immediately the group of successive B-frames, where the B-frame to be interpolated is a member of. (The reader is referred to <ref> [LeG 91] </ref> for further details on the MPEG standard). The PET algorithm will be introduced in this paper only to the extend as it is necessary to understand our analytical models as well as the case studies based on those models.

A video stream corresponding to the video Reds Nightmare as also considered by <ref> [Sto 95] </ref> and leading to values l i = 1367 Byte, l P = 900 Byte, l B = 250 Byte for mean frame sizes; cf. similar measurement results for MPEG encoded video streams in [WoB 95]. <p> probability e c , namely e c -0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001-, the amount of redundancy r (no priorities in FEC in this study!) spent, in particular: r -0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35-, such that, in addition x i =x P =x B = 1/(1+r) as suggested by <ref> [Sto 95] </ref>. The packet length p l used for transmission was kept constant now, in particular, p l = 1024 Byte with MPEG and p l = 128 Byte in the case of FEC.
