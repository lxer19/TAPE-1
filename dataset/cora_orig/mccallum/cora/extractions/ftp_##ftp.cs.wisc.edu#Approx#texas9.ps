Title: Wavelets and Their Associated Operators  
Author: Amos Ron 
Abstract: This article is devoted to the study of wavelets based on the theory of shift-invariant spaces. It consists of two, essentially disjoint, parts. In the first part, the fiberization of the analysis operator of a shift-invariant system is discussed. That fiberization applies to wavelet systems via the notion of quasi-wavelet systems, and leads to the theory of wavelet frames. Highlights in this theory are the unitary and mixed extension principles, and the MRA construction of framelets. The second part of the article is devoted to the study of the cascade/transfer operators and the subdivision operator associated with a refinable function. The analysis there is primarily based on the interpretation of the cascade operator as a special quasi-interpolation scheme. This leads to a surprisingly simple analysis of certain properties of refinable functions, including their smoothness and the convergence of the cascade and subdivision algorithms. In particular, it follows that these latter algorithms, if handled properly, always converge.

Reference-contexts: Quasi-wavelet systems may not be a mere theoretical tool. These systems were introduced in [68] for the sole purpose of the eventual fiberiza-tion of the wavelet operators. However, experiments that were done (independently) with `translation-invariant' wavelet systems <ref> [14] </ref> revealed superior results compared to the standard wavelet systems. Since those latter systems are (essentially) dilations of quasi-wavelet systems, there might be intrinsic promise in quasi-wavelet systems. At present, we lack a theory that explains the results of [14]. <p> However, experiments that were done (independently) with `translation-invariant' wavelet systems <ref> [14] </ref> revealed superior results compared to the standard wavelet systems. Since those latter systems are (essentially) dilations of quasi-wavelet systems, there might be intrinsic promise in quasi-wavelet systems. At present, we lack a theory that explains the results of [14]. Framelets and their extension principles possess great potential in several areas of applications: feature detection, noise removal, image compression, and possibly for solving PDEs. All these applications require the implementation of the system with the aid of a fast transform.

Reference-contexts: Without this assumption, one can only get upper and lower bounds on the smoothness (cf. <ref> [16] </ref>). 2) The refinable is scalar-valued (rather than vector-valued). This assumption simplifies substantially the notations; however, it should be stressed that many of the arguments here can be easily carried over to that setup (specifically, the treatment of convergence and the treatment of smoothness). 3) The refinable is compactly supported. <p> Thus k b k L 2 (IR d ) &lt; 1. The next result was proved first in [51], under the assumption that the mask is polynomial; see also <ref> [16] </ref>. We remind the reader that, for a compactly supported 2 L 2 (IR d ), the stability of E () is characterized by the positivity everywhere of the function from Lemma 3.1.4 (cf. [77], [24], [47], [48], [5]). Theorem 3.1.11. [65]. Let be a compactly supported refinable distribution. <p> The treatment of L 2 -smoothness for single 2 L 2 (IR d ) and for non-isotropic dilations (still under the stability and polynomiality assumptions) is contained in <ref> [16] </ref>: as said, one cannot compute exactly the smoothness parameter in that general setup. That Cohen et al. article stimulated [73] where the L 2 -smoothness parameter was completely characterized (several variables, isotropic dilations, positive/negative smoothness, a vector , no stability and/or polynomiality assumptions).

Reference-contexts: It is worth mentioning that the shifts of this do not form a Riesz basis, and this explains the essential lack of prior constructions based on this function (the only exception I know is the 4-direction frames that were constructed in <ref> [17] </ref> by oversampling. However, the dual systems of those frames do not have compact support). An added flexibility to the construction of framelets is obtained when one uses MRA to construct bi-frames i.e., a wavelet frame together with a dual wavelet frame.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we let E n () := (E ff : 2 ; ff 2 ZZ d =n); with n some integer, and define the wavelet system X n () similarly to (2.1.11), with E () there replaced by E n () here. Following <ref> [18] </ref>, we consider the new system as an oversampling of X ().

We note that the situation is different if the oversampling rate is even (cf. <ref> [18] </ref> and [68]). 2.2. Wavelets: Extension Principles, Framelets, B-Spline Framelets The fiberization of wavelet systems, when combined with the vehicle of mul-tiresolution analysis (MRA), leads to new ways for constructing wavelet frames.

Reference-contexts: The theory is based on an interplay between the wavelet system and a new (special) type of shift-invariant system: the quasi-wavelet system. As a result, simple extension techniques for constructing a wavelet system from a given MRA (multiresolution analysis, cf. [54], [55], <ref> [27] </ref>, and [48]) become possible: the highlight of this part is that the refinable function need not satisfy any particular property, i.e., its shifts need neither form a Riesz basis nor form a frame. <p> Again, this recovers a known result (cf.

Chui and Larry L. <p> The technique for dealing with the vector case is primarily based on superfunction theory (cf. [5], [7], and [60]), a technique that does not invoke, at least not in an explicit way, any operator-based approach. The approximation orders of framelets are also derived from the general theory (cf. <ref> [30] </ref>), and while they do rely on the structure of the synthesis operator of a shift-invariant system, they seem to be a bit beyond the scope of this article. The relations between the approximation orders of the scaling function and its smoothness are discussed in [64]. <p> In Figure 2 we show the case n = 4. We refer the reader to [70], [34], and <ref> [30] </ref> for further construction methods that are based on the unitary extension principle. It is worth mentioning that in more than one variable, dyadically refinable functions may not be the prime candidates for framelet constructions. <p> See [69], [71], and <ref> [30] </ref> for more details as well as specific examples of bi-framelets.

It is worthwhile to note that a different type of wavelet fiberization technique appears in [75], [76]. The results there appear helpful in analyzing oversampling systems, when the oversampling ratio is even. 3.

Let be a refinable function that lies in W ff p (IR d ) for some 1 p 1 and some ff &gt; 0. <p> The above proposition has one immediate consequence: since we can force the cascade algorithm to converge, and even at fast rates, we can do the same with the subdivision: Wavelets and Their Associated Operators 23 Theorem 3.2.12. <ref> [59] </ref>. The subdivision always converges, and converges fast. Let be a refinable function that lies in W ff p (IR d ) for some 1 p 1 and some ff &gt; 0. Let be some compactly supported distribution so that b- b 2 L 1 (IR d ). <p> Note that if the subdivision algorithm converges on ffi (for some p and ff), it converges on each 2 Q (in that norm and rate); in particular, it converges on each 2 K to fl 0 = 0.

Let 1 p 1, and let 0 &lt; ff 1. Assume that 2 W ff p (IR d ). <p> The theorem leads to several important consequences. For instance, if 2 W ff 1 (IR) for some ff &gt; 0, and if the subdivision converges (on all sequences) in some norm at some rate, it must converge in all other p-norms (albeit at possibly different rates). We refer to <ref> [59] </ref> and [13] for further discussions. 3.3. Smoothness of Refinable Functions Lemma 3.1.4 and Lemma 3.2.3 are key tools in almost any analysis of refinable functions that is based on the transfer operator. <p> At the time this article is written, I strongly believe it to be true, but cannot say whether it is easy or hard to solve it. The conjecture is proved in <ref> [59] </ref> under various additional assumptions (for example, under the assumption that K = 0, and under the weaker assumption that f = g fl 0 u, where u fl K = 0.

That theory, which is detailed in <ref> [68] </ref>, [69], is based on the fiberization of shift-invariant systems, [5], [66]. Fiberization. The idea behind fiberization is to analyze a complicated operator S with the aid of a collection (S ! ) !2 of operators of simpler structure (each of which is a `fiber'). <p> The attempt to apply the shift-invariant fiberization techniques to the almost shift-invariant wavelet system led in <ref> [68] </ref> to the introduction of a link between wavelet systems and shift-invariant systems in the form of quasi-wavelet systems. 8 A. Ron Definition 2.1.12. Quasi-wavelet systems. <p> For instance, in the (1)-scale, the even shifts of the function 2 d=2 ( 2 ) are replaced by the integer shifts of the re-normalized function 2 d ( 2 ). Theorem 2.1.13. <ref> [68] </ref>, [69]. Let X := X () be a wavelet system, X q its quasi-wavelet system counterpart. 1) X is a Bessel system iff X q is a Bessel system. <p> Then Y := X (R) is a frame dual to X if and only if Y q is a frame dual to X q . We remark that a smoothness assumption (a mild one: it is satisfied, e.g., by the univariate and multivariate Haar functions) is imposed on in <ref> [68] </ref>, [69]. In [22] it is shown that the first two statements in the above result hold even without that assumption. Since the quasi-wavelet system X q is shift-invariant, it admits a fiber-ization. <p> d g: (2:1:15) (Thus, for example, = 1 off the 2-dyadic numbers, 0 on 2ZZ d , and (!) = 1 iff ! = 0.) Then, the (ff; fi) 2 2ZZ d fi 2ZZ d -entry of the dual Gramian fiber J ! J fl ! of X q is <ref> [68] </ref>, Thus we have the following fundamental result: Wavelets and Their Associated Operators 9 Theorem 2.1.16. [68]. Let X () be a wavelet system. <p> , and (!) = 1 iff ! = 0.) Then, the (ff; fi) 2 2ZZ d fi 2ZZ d -entry of the dual Gramian fiber J ! J fl ! of X q is <ref> [68] </ref>, Thus we have the following fundamental result: Wavelets and Their Associated Operators 9 Theorem 2.1.16. [68]. Let X () be a wavelet system. <p> Example 2.1.22. Oversampling. In order to explore this case we need also to consider systems that are shift-invariant with respect to a superlattice of ZZ d . For simplicity, we consider only lattices that are scalar scales of an integer lattice (see <ref> [68] </ref> for the general case). Thus, we let E n () := (E ff : 2 ; ff 2 ZZ d =n); with n some integer, and define the wavelet system X n () similarly to (2.1.11), with E () there replaced by E n () here. <p> It follows then that X n () is tight if X () is. The particular oversampling result above is due to Chui and Shi (and was proved originally by different means). We note that the situation is different if the oversampling rate is even (cf. [18] and <ref> [68] </ref>). 2.2. Wavelets: Extension Principles, Framelets, B-Spline Framelets The fiberization of wavelet systems, when combined with the vehicle of mul-tiresolution analysis (MRA), leads to new ways for constructing wavelet frames. <p> As one encounters in the Riesz basis case (cf. [55], [48]), the construction is based on matrix extensions. However, in stark contrast with Riesz bases constructions, no a priori assumption need be imposed on the refinable . We start with the discussion of tight wavelet frames. <ref> [68] </ref> contains a complete characterization of all tight wavelet frames that can be constructed by using the above MRA approach. That characterization easily leads to the following unitary extension principle. Theorem 2.2.2.

Quasi-wavelet systems may not be a mere theoretical tool. These systems were introduced in <ref> [68] </ref> for the sole purpose of the eventual fiberiza-tion of the wavelet operators. However, experiments that were done (independently) with `translation-invariant' wavelet systems [14] revealed superior results compared to the standard wavelet systems.
