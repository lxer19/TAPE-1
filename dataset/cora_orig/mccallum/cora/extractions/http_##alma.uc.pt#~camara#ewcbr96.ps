Abstract: francisco@alma.uc.pt, grilo@alma.uc.pt, amilcar@dei.uc.pt) Abstract. This paper describes a representation of plan cases as a structured set of goals and actions. These goals and actions are the unit pieces that form a case. These case pieces are related each other by hierarchical and temporal links (explanations) forming a treelike network. We give importance not just to explicit links, i.e., links between case pieces which are concretely known, but also to implicit ones, i.e., possibly unknown links between case pieces. Each case piece is explained by antecedent links and explains other case pieces by consequent links. The retrieval of a case piece is mainly guided by its links and by its surrounding case pieces. Our concept of case piece usefulness is briefly explained. We discuss the benefit of reusing and directly accessing small case pieces from multiple cases for improving the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) systems capability and efficiency to solve problems. We explain the importance of stepwise refinement in plan cases and also the role that temporal representation can take in the meaningful and coherent construction of planning problem solutions. An application in musical composition domain is presented. We also show how a musical composition task can be treated as a planning task.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Considering cases as set of pieces <ref> (Barletta & Mark, 1988) </ref>, also called snippets (Kolodner, 1988; Redmond, 1990; Sycara & Navinchandra, 1991) or footprints (Veloso, 1992; Bento, Macedo & Costa, 1994) instead of monolithic entities, can improve the results of a CBR system in that solutions of problems may result from the contribution of multiple cases.

Reference-contexts: Explanations are necessary to similarity judgement (Barletta & Mark, 1989; Cain, Pazzani & Silverstein, 1991; Veloso, 1992; Bento & Costa, 1994). CBR is appropriate for domains where a strong theory does not exist but past experience is accessible. This leads to the consideration of cases imperfectly explained <ref> (Bento, Macedo & Costa, 1994) </ref>. A plan is a specific sequence of steps (or actions) with the aim of a goal achievement. Case-Based Planning (CBP) systems reuse past sequences of actions from past plans to construct new ones. <p> The explanation embeds the causal temporal relation between the case pieces. Sometimes the type of relation between antecedent fact (s) and the consequent one may be unknown. This lack of a complete theory is common in CBR <ref> (Bento, Macedo & Costa, 1994) </ref>. This idea leads to another classification of the links between case pieces: we say that a link between the case pieces a and b is explicit if we known the relation between a and b , and implicit if we do not. <p> These novel associations may be required just in some hierarchical levels. 5 e.g., Bentos quantitative metric <ref> (Bento & Costa, 1994) </ref>. To be published in the proceedings of the 3 rd European Workshop on Case Based Reasoning , EWCBR96, Lausanne, Switzerland, November 1996 Therefore each one of the hierarchical levels has a selection criterion, which is defined by the user.

This leads to an hierarchical representation of plan cases <ref> (Khemani & Prasad, 1995) </ref>. The case representation is similar to a tree where each node is a goal and its sons the subgoals, or at the latest level, the actions of the plan. Each goal (or action) depends on other goals.

Reference-contexts: Although many CBR systems select out cases that are most similar to the new problem, other selection criteria may prove more effective. E.g., Kolodner <ref> (Kolodner, 1989) </ref> has considered that the most useful cases are those that can address the reasoners current goal, which means that they may not be the most similar ones. Knowledge-based retrieval systems (Koton, 1989) are a consequence of combining nearest neighbour and knowledge-guided techniques. <p> For example, it gives a bigger weight to explicit links similarities than to implicit ones. The selection of the most useful case piece involves the computation of a similarity metric value for it and the consideration of the degree of matching the needs of the goal being achieved <ref> (Kolodner, 1989) </ref>. Thus, the most useful case piece may not be the one with the most similarities. We think that this issue depends on the domain. <p> Thus, we may conclude that in these kind of problems the most useful case piece <ref> (Kolodner, 1989) </ref> is the one: (i) which gives more original case pieces associations to the new case; (ii) and that does not confront the coherence and meaningfulness of the new case. 7 Conclusions We have presented an approach to representing structured plans as a combination of a treelike network with a

Reference-contexts: Moreover, structured representations of cases <ref> (Plaza, 1995) </ref> allow treating pieces of cases as full-fledged cases, minimising the problems that appear when using parts of multiple monolithic cases, particularly, the lot of effort taken to find the useful parts in them.

Reference-contexts: A plan is a specific sequence of steps (or actions) with the aim of a goal achievement. Case-Based Planning (CBP) systems reuse past sequences of actions from past plans to construct new ones. Some systems like CELIA <ref> (Redmond, 1990) </ref>, MEDIATOR (Simpson, 1985), JULIA (Kolodner, 1989; Hinrichs, 1988), PRODIGY/ANALOGY (Veloso, 1992), and CAPlan/CbC (Munz-Avila & Huellen, 1995) break up the goal into smaller subgoals, enabling plan construction by composition of sub-plans. This leads to an hierarchical representation of plan cases (Khemani & Prasad, 1995). <p> If the criterion was to select the less similar case piece, then more novel associations were made, and therefore, the new case was more original, but probably, it was also more bizarre. 6 Discussion Our approach to case representation has some similarities with CELIA's <ref> (Redmond, 1990) </ref> which are mainly: cases are stored in pieces; there are links between case pieces to maintain the structure of the case; case pieces are accessed taking into account the case piece context; a case is constructed with case pieces of multiple cases. However there also some key differences.
