Title: Implementing Reaction-Diffusion on an Amorphous Computer  
Author: Daniel Coore, Radhika Nagpal 
Affiliation: MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  
Abstract: Traditionally reaction-diffusion simulations have been performed on regularly discretised spaces. In an Amorphous Computer [1] the processors are distributed densely but randomly. By implementing the Gray-Scott model on an amorphous computer simulation, we show that the patterns obtained by uniform discretisation can also be re-alised qualitatively on irregular, amorphous dis-cretisations if diffusion is modeled correctly.

Address: Room 434, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge MA 02139. Pearson <ref> [2] </ref> has catalogued the patterns obtained at twelve points in f; k parameter space. In those simulations, space was discretised into 256fi256 squares, each of which acted as a reaction locus.
