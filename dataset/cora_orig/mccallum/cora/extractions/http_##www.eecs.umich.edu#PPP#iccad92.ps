Abstract: Geometric knowledge of the shape of the feasible region formed by pulse width, setup, and hold constraints, is used directly by a new efficient (cubic complexity) algorithm, Gpipe, to determine the maximum rate for single-phase clocking of a given pipeline. The pipeline model uses level-sensitive latches as synchronizers and can allow wave pipelining. Gpipe is also used to explore the effect of removing non-synchronizing and/or synchronizing latches on the maximum clock speed of the pipeline. A simple test shows which latches, if any, to remove to guarantee no decrease and permit a possible increase in the clock rate.

Reference-contexts: 1 Pipeline and Clocking Model The pipeline and clocking model used in this program is based on the model described in <ref> [1] </ref>. The pipeline is modeled as a single closed loop with N stages separated by N synchronizers, which are chosen to be latches in this paper. Latches are harder to model, but impose less clocking overhead than flip-flops [1]. <p> model used in this program is based on the model described in <ref> [1] </ref>.

Latches are harder to model, but impose less clocking overhead than flip-flops [1]. <p> This is never possible with edge-triggered or master-slave flip-flops. 2 The Gpipe Algorithm Previous work in <ref> [1] </ref> used a general linear program (LP) solver to find the minimum T c if T 1 can vary from stage to stage (coincident multiphase clocking), and produced a closed form solution for the restricted (suboptimal) case that (13) must be satisfied for l = 0.

Reference-contexts: Time Constraints We can now derive a necessary and sufficient set of constraints, (9)-(13), that defines all feasible (T 1 ; T c ) solutions, and hence minimum T c , for single-phase clocking of a given pipeline with a specified degree of wave pipelining in each stage (adapted from <ref> [2] </ref>). <p> From the analysis in <ref> [2] </ref>, we know that the short path constraint with l = 0 for stage i applies when the early signal departs from the previous latch (i 1) at the enabling edge of its clock, i.e. the early arrival signal (a i1 ) is blocked by latch i 1 until its clock

Reference-contexts: = N , the complexity is O (N 3 ). 3 Maximum Rate Clocking and the Ef fect of Removing Latches We now apply Gpipe to an example to derive the minimum T c for a single-phase clock, and to explore the effects of removing latches and introducing wave pipelining <ref> [3] </ref>. Consider the minimum T c single-phase clock for the following 4 stage closed pipeline without any wave pipelining in any stage (Table 1). The geometric relationships between constraints are illustrated in Fig. 3.
