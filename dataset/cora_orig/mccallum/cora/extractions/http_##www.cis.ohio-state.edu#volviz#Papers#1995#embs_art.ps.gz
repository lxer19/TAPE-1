Abstract: Similarly to the PKLUTs used in [3], voxel footprints can be implemented as high-resolution 1D voxel projection tables (2D for cubic voxels), one for each projection angle j, where each table entry represents the result of a linear integration of h(u,v) orthogonal to the projection plane of P j . In the projection phase, for a particular projection angle j, we compute for each grid voxel v j the projection Proj(v j ) of v j s center, and subsequently the extent Ext(Proj(v j )) of the voxel projection table on the projection plane. We then index the table for all pixels that fall within Ext(Proj(v j )) to obtain v j s contribution to these pixels. Note that most of the projection calculations can be performed as incremental operations. SARTs grid update equation [1] can then be implemented as follows: We associate two buffers with the projection plane: buffer B r accumulating ray sum and buffer B w accumulating the weights as voxels are projected. Buffer B o is the aquired projection image. After all voxels have been processed, the correction image buffer B c is computed as: where l, 0&lt;l1.0 is a relaxation factor [1]. In the reprojection phase, the correction buffer B c is distributed back onto the reconstruction grid. As in the projection phase, for each voxel v j we compute Proj(v j ) and Ext(Proj(v j )). The correction term for v j is then computed as the weighted sum of all correction terms affecting v j : Our discussion so far was limited to the parallel beam case, however, our approach is easily extended to fan and cone beam data with one modification: One has to scale each voxel footprint according to the perspective distortion.

RESULTS where c start is the cost per projection pixel for setting up a new ray, c step is the cost per ray sample for advancing the ray and determining the voxels affected, and c accu is the cost for updating B w and B r . N is the voxel grid size, Ext is the kernel extent, and f s is the degree of projection pixel supersampling. It was shown [2] that if f s =5 and a Gaussian 1/2 interpolation kernel (Ext = 3) is used, noise artifacts due to aliasing can be reduced to a neglible level (see Fig. 2). For f s =5 the ratio C back / C ray is then approximately equal to 0.68. In original SART, two arrays, both of size N, are needed to hold the temporary weight and correction term accumulations in the re-projection phase. In our approach, the size of these arrays reduces to the buffer size . Hence, only of the memory used in the original SART realization is required. We have described a table-based backward-viewing procedure which accelerates both projection phases of anti-aliased ART. The speedup is especially notable when pixel supersam- pling is performed. For block-iterative methods, memory consumption is significantly reduced. Our approach is easily extended to fan and cone beam data, and a parallel implementation is facilitated by the inherent independence of voxels. REFERENCES [1] A.H. Andersen, A.C.
