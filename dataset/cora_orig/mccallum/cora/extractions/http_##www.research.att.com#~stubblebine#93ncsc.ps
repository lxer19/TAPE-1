Title: Security Services for Multimedia Conferencing  
Date: September 20-23, 1993.  
Note: Proceedings of the 16th National Computer Security Conference, Baltimore, Maryland,  
Abstract: Multimedia conferencing is the use of mixed media such as real-time audio, video, and groupware for group tele-collaboration. Multimedia conferencing may well become as widespread an application on network computers as electronic mail. The demand for security in multimedia conferencing is high because the users expectation of being monitored is high. In this paper we discuss security services for protecting multimedia conferencing, how well these services scale to large conferences, and what security infrastructure is needed.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Electronic mail is perhaps the most popular application on networked computers. Several standards for secure electronic mail have evolved, including the Internets Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail [L93] and the U.S. governments Pre-Message Security Protocol <ref> [B93] </ref>. With the exception of electronic mail systems running on private networks protected by link encryption, secure electronic mail has been slow to mature. The slow growth is partially attributed to the difficulty of developing an acceptable infrastructure for public key certificate based authentication [X.509].

Reference-contexts: The growing demand for teleconferencing is demonstrated by the regular multicasts of audio and video from the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meetings over the MBONE, a multicast capable portion of the Internet <ref> [CD92] </ref>. The most recent teleconference included 339 sites in 14 countries. There is a growing demand for security as participants are becoming aware of how easy it is for others to monitor their conferences.

Reference-contexts: Controlling access to conferences is also an important security requirement. We can specify conference access policies using the access matrix model <ref> [HRU76] </ref>. Access Control The access control matrix specifies the rights a subject may have with respect to an object . A subject in a conference consists of a conference site or attendee at a site.

Reference-contexts: Information presented in a conference can not be substantiated. Laws of many countries preclude the contents of a private conversation to be used against them in a court of law. Therefore, parties to a conference have an expectation that the information they exchange will not be used against them <ref> [R93] </ref>. (Note that identity confidentiality may provide repudiation of transmission.) Availability to Present. A presenter is not denied from contributing to a conference in accordance with the conference policy. Recipient Identity Confidentiality. The identity of a conference recipient is protected against unauthorized disclosure. Origin Authentication.

Reference-contexts: Scalability of Security Services We now discuss how well todays security technology scales in providing the various security services. The design of a protection architecture depends on the size of a conference. Conferences are sometimes described by the number of attendees <ref> [S93] </ref>. A small conference is highly interactive and consists of only a few participants. A medium sized conference might consists of hundreds or thousands of participants and is typical of an interactive seminar with many recipients but relatively few presenters.

Reference-contexts: Conference control servers are needed that will enforce access control policies to information flows and media devices. Secure Communication Protocols. Communication protocols are needed that will support the protection requirements for real-time communications. For example, work is in progress to augment an experimental Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <ref> [SC93] </ref> to support security features that can be used to satisfy the requirements of a hybrid connection/connectionless integrity service. Secure communication protocols at other layers (e.g. network layer) might also be important. Network Service Guarantees. Network service providers need to provide guarantees for use of bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: With the exception of electronic mail systems running on private networks protected by link encryption, secure electronic mail has been slow to mature. The slow growth is partially attributed to the difficulty of developing an acceptable infrastructure for public key certificate based authentication <ref> [X.509] </ref>. It is also attributed to users lack of awareness to the susceptibility of electronic mail to wiretapping attacks. Multimedia conferencing, the combination of real-time packet audio, video, and groupware multiway tele-collaborations, is likely to become as widespread an application on network computers as electronic mail.
