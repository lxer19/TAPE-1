Abstract: The mobile wireless environment poses challenging problems in designing fault-tolerant systems because of the dynamics of mobility, and limited bandwidth available on wireless links. Traditional fault-tolerance schemes, therefore, cannot be directly applied to these systems. Mobile systems are often subject to environmental conditions which can cause loss of communications or data. Because of the consumer orientation of most mobile systems, run-time faults must be corrected with minimal (if any) intervention from the user. The fault-tolerance capability, consequently, must, be transparent to the user.

Reference-contexts: It has been pointed out [3] that while the disk storage on a static host is stable, the stability of any storage on a mobile host is questionable, for reasons such as dropping of laptops or effect of airport security systems <ref> [1] </ref>. Thus, a mobile host's disk storage cannot be considered stable and is vulnerable to failures. Moreover, all mobile hosts are not necessarily equipped with disk storage. Thus, we need the stable storage to be located on a static host. <p> The protocol also tolerates the corruption of these logical timestamps. Lin [13], studies the recovery of mobility databases at the visitor location register (V LR) and home location register (HLR) for personal communication networks. Schemes with and without checkpointing are described and analyzed. Acharya et.al. <ref> [1] </ref>, identify the problems with checkpointing mobile distributed applications, presenting an algorithm for recording global checkpoints for distributed applications running on mobile hosts. In this paper, however, we consider protocols to recover from failure in a mobile host, independent of other hosts in the system.

Reference-contexts: Work on fault-tolerance issues is very limited. Alagar et.al. <ref> [2] </ref>, demonstrate schemes to tolerate base station failures by replicating the information stored at a base station, at several "secondary" base stations. Strategies for 4 selecting the secondary base stations were shown.

Reference-contexts: Some of the differences between static and mobile networks are enumerated in Table 1. Traditional fault-tolerance schemes like checkpointing and message logging [9, 15] require a stable storage for saving the checkpoint and the logs. It has been pointed out <ref> [3] </ref> that while the disk storage on a static host is stable, the stability of any storage on a mobile host is questionable, for reasons such as dropping of laptops or effect of airport security systems [1]. <p> In such strategies, the host periodically saves its state at a stable storage. Thus, upon failure of the host, execution can be restarted from the last-saved checkpoint. It was indicated earlier <ref> [3] </ref> that a mobile host's disk storage cannot be considered 5 stable. Thus, our algorithms use the storage available at the base station for the cell in which the mobile host is currently residing, as the stable storage.

Reference-contexts: The mobile host then loads the latest state and resumes operation. Importantly, need for frequent transmission of state on the wireless link is a limiting factor for this scheme. * Logging Approach (denoted as L): This approach is rooted in "pessimistic" logging <ref> [4] </ref>, used in static systems. In this scheme, a mobile host checkpoints its state periodically. To facilitate recovery, the write events that take place in the interval between checkpoints are also logged.

Reference-contexts: During a handoff period, there are no packets sent or received by the mobile host. Thus, if handoff time is very high, the communication protocols used for these connection-oriented services might timeout and/or the mobile host might notice long disruption in service during handoffs <ref> [5] </ref>. Some applications might require a very quick recovery, and some other applications might require a very low total cost to be incurred by the recovery schemes. Some hosts 25 might be running the application in a high failure rate environment, and some in a very low failure rate environment.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A distributed system with mobile hosts is composed of a static backbone network and a dynamic wireless network <ref> [7, 12] </ref>. A node that can move while retaining its network connection is referred to as a mobile host. A static network is comprised of the fixed hosts and the communication network. <p> This process, known as handoff, is transparent to the mobile host. Thus, end-to-end connectivity in the dynamically changing network topology is preserved transparently. A mobile host may become unavailable due to (i) failure of the mobile host, (ii) disconnection of the mobile host, and (iii) wireless link failure <ref> [7, 8, 11, 12, 16] </ref>. Loss of battery power make disconnections from the network frequent, and sometimes unpredictable. Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures. The difference between disconnection and failure is its elective nature. <p> Because of their frequency, disconnections must be treated differently than failures. The difference between disconnection and failure is its elective nature. User initiated disconnections can be treated as planned failures, which can be anticipated and prepared for <ref> [7, 8, 18] </ref>. The wireless link is equivalent to an intermittently faulty link, which transmits correct messages during fault-free conditions, and stops any transmissions upon a failure. Disconnections and weak wireless links primarily delay the system response, whereas a host failure affects the system state. <p> Section 3 presents the recovery strategies. Section 4 gives the performance analysis of the recovery strategies, and conclusions are presented in Section 5. 2 Related Work Research in mobile computing primarily has focused on mobility management, database system issues, network protocols, disconnected operation and distributed algorithms for mobile hosts <ref> [7, 8, 12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Strategies are developed in this paper to recover from various transient faults in the mobile host. These are faults that are typically caused by environmental upsets (e.g., wireless link failure, power glitches at the mobile host, electromagnetic interference, radiation, etc.) or software errors (e.g., heisenbugs <ref> [9] </ref>, rarely used code paths, etc.). Transient failures are the most common mode of failure [15]. A mobile host failure results in a loss of its state. We assume the well known fail-silent [15] model. <p> Transient failure recovery requires re-execution from a known good state or a complete restart. Checkpointing and message logging techniques have been proposed earlier for efficient rollback and recovery with minimal loss in performance <ref> [9, 15] </ref>.

Traditional fault-tolerance schemes like checkpointing and message logging <ref> [9, 15] </ref> require a stable storage for saving the checkpoint and the logs. <p> The base station then forwards the messages to the corresponding mobile host. Likewise, all messages sent by a mobile host will first be sent to its base station, which will forward them to the destination host (static or mobile). Two strategies to save the process state <ref> [9] </ref> will be discussed here: (i) No Logging and (ii) Logging. It is assumed that the mobile host remains in one cell during the length of the application.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the appropriate recovery protocol needs to be determined adaptively, based on the characteristics of the underlying wireless network and users. Performance of traditional recovery schemes primarily depends on the failure rate of the host <ref> [14, 21] </ref>. However, in a mobile environment, due to mobility of the hosts and limited bandwidth on the wireless links, parameters other than failure rate of the mobile host play a key role in determining the effectiveness of a recovery scheme.
