Abstract: Two-dimensional conformal arrays are proposed to enhance low contrast lesion detection deep in the body. The arrays conform to the body maintaining good contact over a large area. To provide full three-dimensional focusing for two-dimensional imaging, such arrays are densely sampled in the scan direction (x) and coarsely sampled in the non-scan direction (y), i.e., the arrays are anisotropic. To illustrate reduction in slice thickness with increased array length in y, a two-dimensional array is synthesized using a one-dimensional, 128 element array with a 3.5 MHz center frequency. An acoustic mask is attached confining transmission and reception of acoustic waves to 2 mm in y. Using a mechanical scan system, the one-dimensional array is moved along y covering a 28.16 mm fi 20.0 mm aperture. Accordingly, the synthetic array has 128 elements in x and 10 elements in y. To correct for geometric irregularities due to array movement, a gelatin based phantom containing three-dimensional point targets is used for phase aberration correction. Results show that elevational beam quality is degraded if small geometric errors are not removed. Emulated conformality at the body surface and phase aberrations induced by spatial inhomogeneities in tissue are further imposed and shown to produce severe beamforming artifacts. Two-dimensional phase aberration correction is applied and results indicate that the method is adequate to compensate for large phase excursions across the entire array. To fully realize the potential of large, two-dimensional, conformal arrays, proper two-dimensional phase aberration correction methods are necessary.

Reference-contexts: The major drawbacks are hardware complexity, complicated interconnect and the high input impedance of individual array elements. Second, two-dimensional sparse arrays have been investigated to reduce the complexity of fully sampled two-dimensional arrays while avoiding unwanted grating lobes <ref> [3] </ref>. Average sidelobe levels, however, increase as the number of elements decreases. Furthermore, the individual element input impedance is as high as the impedance of fully sampled arrays.

Reference-contexts: It was further shown that one-dimensional phase aberration correction is ineffective in the breast. To produce high image quality with adaptive systems, two-dimensional phased arrays are needed to develop proper two-dimensional aberration correction schemes. Phase aberration correction on a two-dimensional anisotropic array has been investigated in <ref> [4] </ref>. Algorithms for two-dimensional phase aberration correction were developed by extending the one-dimensional, correlation based method. Two types of two-dimensional aberration correction architectures were proposed and simulations showed that both methods produced high quality phase estimates.

Reference-contexts: Since the surface of the body is non-planar, a non-planar array must be used if adequate contact is to be maintained over a large area. Recent developments in ceramic/polymer composite materials make the construction of flexible two-dimensional arrays possible <ref> [5, 20, 21] </ref>. Details of the construction methods, however, are beyond the scope of this paper. To date, only planar, spherical and cylindrical array geometries have been explored for diagnostic ultrasound. In antenna arrays, on the other hand, conformality is of interest for spacecraft, aircraft and land vehicle applications.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the array element should be small enough to produce high correlation between neighbors. Other design considerations for two-dimensional anisotropic arrays include tolerance to blocked elements and single element diffraction patterns. Some of these issues have been addressed in <ref> [6, 16] </ref>. Systematic approaches for optimal array geometry design based on adaptive imaging system requirements should be further explored. Since anisotropic arrays are used for full three-dimensional focusing but only steering in a single plane, Fresnel sampling can be used in y (i.e., equal sampling of y 2 ).

Reference-contexts: The inoperable elements, however, result in degraded beam patterns and deteriorate contrast 2 resolution. Furthermore, spatial resolution is degraded if the total aperture size is re-duced. To compensate for blocked array elements, an object dependent algorithm has been proposed <ref> [7] </ref>. The algorithm utilizes multiple receive beams to estimate and remove undesired sidelobe contributions. Details and performance associated with this algorithm have been addressed in [7, 8]. Aberrations due to sound velocity inhomogeneities are also likely to produce severe beamforming artifacts. <p> To compensate for blocked array elements, an object dependent algorithm has been proposed [7].

Reference-contexts: Therefore, time-of-flight errors (i.e., phase aberrations) can be found as the position of the maximum in the cross-correlation function. Based on this method, a real-time aberration correction system using a baseband beam former has been described in <ref> [15] </ref>. A simple rerouting method has also been applied to demonstrate the robustness of phase aberration estimation in the presence of inoperable elements. Although many methods are effective for small errors across a one-dimensional aperture, problems arise with these methods if applied to large two-dimensional arrays. <p> th channels is given by t n = max C n (t n ) : (2) The differential delay t n can also be estimated from the phase of the zero lag complex correlation computed using the complex baseband representation of the signals S n (t) and S n+1 (t) <ref> [15] </ref>. The unwrapped delays across the aperture can therefore be determined as T n = i=1 where T 1 is generally set to 0. Alternate unwrap procedures can be used to estimate the delay function T n from the set of t i [25].

Reference-contexts: Clearly, tissue inhomogeneities are not restricted only in the array (scan) direction. With a large array length in the non-scan direction, it is obvious that proper estimation of phase aberrations must be performed two-dimensionally. Factors affecting array 3 design for two-dimensional phase aberration correction have been studied in <ref> [16] </ref>. It is shown that element size can affect the tolerance of aberration correction algorithms to noise, inoperable elements and other factors. Two-dimensional in vitro and in vivo measurements of phase aberrations produced by human tissue have been reported [17-19]. <p> Therefore, the array element should be small enough to produce high correlation between neighbors. Other design considerations for two-dimensional anisotropic arrays include tolerance to blocked elements and single element diffraction patterns.

Reference-contexts: Compu-tationally efficient algorithms have also been proposed using the l 1 norm of the errors between signals received by different channels <ref> [23] </ref>. The above discussion concentrates on one-dimensional arrays. In two dimensions, additional issues arise. For the two-dimensional architecture (full two-dimensional correlation structure) shown in Figure 3, each array element can be correlated with four adjacent elements (except for boundary elements).

Reference-contexts: Since two-dimensional, conformal arrays are primarily proposed for abdominal and cardiac imaging, a partial cylinder is therefore adequate to approximate the lower order components of the array geometry conforming to a human body surface <ref> [24] </ref>. In addition, since the array was densely sampled in x and coarsely sampled in y, it was more tolerant of deformation in x than in y. Therefore, the conformality of the array was modelled as follows.

Reference-contexts: The unwrapped delays across the aperture can therefore be determined as T n = i=1 where T 1 is generally set to 0. Alternate unwrap procedures can be used to estimate the delay function T n from the set of t i <ref> [25] </ref>. Note that equation (2) can be easily shown to be equivalent to t n = min Z T (S n (o ) S n+1 (t n + o )) 2 do : (4) Therefore, this correlation based method can be viewed as a l 2 norm solution. <p> This becomes more important if there is a large number of blocked elements. In a full two-dimensional architecture, the phase closure property can be used to detect aliases. Based on redundant information, a method using least mean square error estimates has been proposed for two-dimensional arrays <ref> [25] </ref>. The least mean square method assumes that arrival time differences are available for all horizontal, vertical and diagonal neighbors. For row-sum architectures, only a single path exists between arbitrary elements and thus the method does not apply directly.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the number of elements in y should be large enough to provide a sufficient number of independent focal zones over ranges of interest. Moreover, according to the van-Cittert-Zernike theorem <ref> [26] </ref>, speckle correlation between two array elements decreases with distance. Therefore, the array element should be small enough to produce high correlation between neighbors. Other design considerations for two-dimensional anisotropic arrays include tolerance to blocked elements and single element diffraction patterns.
