Abstract: This paper introduces a system intended for question answering based on abductive inference. The system uses a large knowledge base structured around WordNet. Texts and questions are uniformly processed and semantic paths between concepts are established using a marker propagation method. The paths bring forward inferences and implicatures that are otherwise difficult to extract. Implicit inferences contribute to the information provided by explicit inferences, producing answers for a variety of question types.

Reference-contexts: The path is found simply by inspecting the path history of the colliding markers and linking the two halves. Each marker participating in a collision provides half of the path as it appears in its field called path. More details about this algorithm can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. 6 Question and Answering The question-answering activity takes place in the context of a text, that was already processed. As indicated previously, the text processing results in identifying the entities and explicit relationships among them. the text in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: Lenat [6] called this the brittleness problem. Text-based Intelligent Systems Another possible solution for intelligent systems, that becomes more and more evident and feasible, is to use the expressive power of natural language to represent knowledge. Jacobs <ref> [5] </ref> called this text-based intelligent systems ( TBIS ) and was among the first to suggest that this approach may replace or augment traditional knowledge-based systems.

Reference-contexts: Since knowledge is unlimited, no matter how large the knowledge base is, it is not possible to capture all the knowledge in the world. Knowledge based systems may work well in some domain, but quickly fail when the domain changes slightly. Lenat <ref> [6] </ref> called this the brittleness problem. Text-based Intelligent Systems Another possible solution for intelligent systems, that becomes more and more evident and feasible, is to use the expressive power of natural language to represent knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Next we present the knowledge base and the inference engine used in our system, after which we discuss how explicit and implicit inferences are obtained. 3 Structure of a Very Large Knowl edge Base WordNet and extensions We decided to build our system on top of WordNet lexical database <ref> [7] </ref> developed at Princeton. WordNet is a semantic dictionary because words are searched based on conceptual affinity with other words. It covers the vast majority of nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs from the English language. The words in WordNet are organized in synonym sets, called synsets.

Reference-contexts: A large part of this system was developed as an information extraction system for the Message Understanding Conference <ref> [9] </ref>. The current system aims at high level inferences. PARIS reads both text and queries as inputs, and processes both with the same modules. The last module provides the output inferences, as answers. extract from Wall Street Journal was one of the messages from the MUC-6 training corpus (http://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/grishman/muc6.html).
