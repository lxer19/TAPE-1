Abstract: In this paper we develop a framework for computing upper and lower bounds of an exponential form for a class of single server queueing systems with non-renewal inputs. These bounds generalize Kingman's bounds for queues with renewal inputs. Keywords: Queues; Exponential bounds; General state space Markov chain fl D.

Reference-contexts: We will assume without loss of generality that the left eigenmeasure is chosen so that l (IE; ) = 1; 8 2 D: (1.9) Recently, Duffield <ref> [5] </ref> found an exponential upper bound for the tail distribution of the stationary regime X in the case when, like in our setting, the joint distribution of (Y n+1 ; ~ n ), conditioned on (X 0 ; Y 0 ; : : : ; Y n ; ~ 0 ; <p> Specializing Duffield's result to the uncoupled case and by assuming, as in <ref> [5] </ref>, that Y is ergodic and stationary, E [~ 0 ] &lt; 0 (stability condition), and F (x; IR + ) &gt; 0 for all x 2 IE, we get that, for every 0 &lt; fl = supfff &gt; 0 : (ff) 1g, the upper bound in (1.5) holds with d <p> In this case, lim s!1 (1=s) log (P (X s)) = fl <ref> [5, Theorem 3] </ref>, which readily implies that fl is the best exponential decay over all 0. The next results are direct consequences of Propositions 2.1 and 2.2. Corollary 2.1 Assume that E [~ 0 ] &lt; 0. <p> In particular, cf. (2.21), A2E l (A; ) when the Markov chain Y is stationary. As mentioned in the introduction another previous work closely related to ours is that of Duffield <ref> [5] </ref> who uses a martingale approach (similar to that in [11] for the GI/GI/1 queue) to obtain upper bounds. This approach that does not require the "decoupling" condition (1.2), does not appear easily to yield lower bounds or transient results.

It is shown in [8, Lemma 3.4i] that log (()) is differentiable and strictly convex on D. This implies that () is also differentiable and strictly convex on D. On the other hand, specializing the differentiation formula (4.3) in <ref> [8] </ref> to our model yields 0 (0) = E [~ 0 ], where 0 (0) denotes the derivative of () at the point = 0. Combining the above results together with the obvious identity (0) = 1 gives (2.12). Let us now prove the second statement of the lemma.
