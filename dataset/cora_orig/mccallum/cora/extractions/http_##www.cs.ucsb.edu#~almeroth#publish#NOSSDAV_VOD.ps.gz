Abstract: Multicast delivery can improve the scalability of Video-On-Demand (VOD) systems by allowing multiple customers to share one set of video server and network resources. In such a system, providing customer interactivity can be difficult. In this paper we overview our work which addresses how interactivity may be accomplished in a multicast delivery environment and analyzes the performance of such systems.

Reference-contexts: While multicast communication offers the advantage of being scalable, the interactive nature of VOD logically demands individualized service. Several solutions have been suggested which group requests for the same movie. We have investigated solutions based on the use of fixed-length time slots to satisfy multiple requests simultaneously <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Others have independently investigated the use of batching and temporal proximity of requests to service multiple requests [3]. In either case, multiple customer requests are satisfied using one set of video server and network resources. <p> Unless tradeoffs in the level of interactivity or system complexity are made, a multicast VOD system must handle VCR actions individually thereby reducing the advantages of using multicast. 3.1 Reducing the On-Demand Nature of the System In part of our work on VOD systems using fixed-length time slots <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, we examine the tradeoff between the on-demand nature of a system and its scalability. Continuous time is divided into equal length time slots in which customer requests will be grouped. Requests that arrive in the same time slot are serviced together at the end of the time slot. <p> In the extreme case when the set-top buffer fills up, the customer can be removed from the multicast group and either serviced individually, or added to another existing multicast group. The detailed operation of a system which provides pause-only using set-top box buffering is described in <ref> [1] </ref>. Changing the Semantics of Customer Interactivity . Interactive VCR functions can also be achieved by modifying the semantics of VCR functions. For example, instead of providing the ability to pause for any duration, a different level of service could offer functions for predetermined time increments. <p> Simulations for all three systems were conducted <ref> [1, 2] </ref> using a six hour prime-time period. A number of requests were uniformly distributed over the simulation period and for each request a movie was chosen using Zipf's Distribution. Each customer initiated VCR actions according to an exponential distribution, and the duration of each action was uniformly distributed. <p> The table below summarizes our observations about the three VOD systems. VCR action blocking, which occurs when no resources are available to handle group changes, can be made acceptable in all cases by allocating a sufficient number of emergency channels. Table 1 summarize the numerical results reported in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>.

A detailed description of a system which provides discontinuous pause, rewind, and fast forward without using set-top box buffering can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. 4 Simulation and Analysis of a Multicast System The performance of a VOD system using multicast communication was analyzed by comparing a unicast system; a multicast system with continuous pause; and a multicast system with discontinuous pause, rewind, and fast forward. <p> Simulations for all three systems were conducted <ref> [1, 2] </ref> using a six hour prime-time period.

Providing interactivity is more difficult in these systems because the video stream multicast to the group cannot be modified because of the VCR actions of one member.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of a unicast VOD system is the ability to guarantee the availability of VCR functions. However, because there is a one-to-one relationship between resources and customer requests, the system does not scale well. Furthermore, providing VCR functions may require additional bandwidth <ref> [4] </ref> and video resources. 3 Multicast Video-On-Demand One way to more efficiently use resources is to deliver the same movie to multiple customers at the same time. Some of our earlier work examined some of the issues in using multicast communication as an information delivery mechanism [6, 7].

Reference-contexts: A multicast VOD system servicing multiple customers cannot provide the same individualized, interactive service as a unicast system, but the illusion of one-to-one servicing can still be provided. Typically, when multicast communication is used, some of the "on-demand" nature of VOD may need to be sacrificed <ref> [5] </ref>; the level of interactivity may need to be reduced; and/or the complexity of system operation and hardware may need to be increased.
