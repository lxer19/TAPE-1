Reference-contexts: IDA is allowed to retrieve a semantically distant analogy in any manner possible, including spontaneous retrieval through a deep heuristically guided search. Anderson's PUPS Another general spreading activation approach to analogy retrieval is implemented in An-derson's PUPS system <ref> [ Anderson and Thompson, 1989 ] </ref> The PUPS approach to analogy mapping consists of repeated applications of a set of three heuristic rules to elaborate the representation of the target concept until it can be easily matched to the base.

Reference-contexts: In the discussion below, conceptual graphs will be referred to merely as "concepts". The basic algorithm of KDSA is shown in Figure 1.1. The low-level search of memory (step 2 in the figure) is conducted by a spreading activation mechanism (see, e.g., <ref> [ Anderson, 1983 ] </ref> ). In this formalism, activation is passed from node to adjacent node via the links that connect them until one concept accumulates enough aggregate activation to be considered retrieved. This basic spreading activation model is a blind knowledge search mechanism. <p> This class includes spreading activation approaches (e.g., <ref> [ Anderson, 1983; Collins and Loftus, 1975; Rau, 1987a ] </ref> ), as well as Win-ston's Classification-Exploiting Hypothesizing [ Winston, 1980 ] and Quillian's intersection search [ Quillian, 1968 ] .

Reference-contexts: WORK ON DESIGN AND CREATIVITY 95 not as yet have a concrete proposal for an alternative retrieval mechanism. Bhatta and Goel's IDeAL Bhatta and Goel address the issue of analogy use in innovative design by learning generic teleological mechanisms (GTMs) in their system, IDeAL <ref> [ Bhatta and Goel, 1993 ] </ref> . GTMs represent abstract design principles such as cascading, feedback, and feedforward which can be used in design tasks across domains.

Reference-contexts: INNOVATIVE DESIGN 37 4.1 Innovative Design Many researchers have classified design along a spectrum of the amount of creativity demonstrated by the designer. Most often, this spectrum is divided into three distinct classes: routine, innovative, and creative design. Some researchers, such as Brown and Chandrasekaran <ref> [ Brown and Chandrasekaran, 1989 ] </ref> and Gero [ Gero, 1990 ] focus on the process of producing the design, making distinctions based on the nature of the design space being searched, the types and quantities used in designing, etc.

Reference-contexts: All or nearly all approaches to analogy have a metric which determines whether a relationship between two concepts constitutes an analogy or not. For some approaches (e.g., Greiner's formalism [ Greiner, 1988 ] or Carbonell's Derivational Analogy <ref> [ Carbonell, 1983a ] </ref> ), this metric more or less measures only whether the transfer step allowed the system to draw a desired inference. <p> Many approaches to analogy do not address this question directly. For the approaches in <ref> [ Greiner, 1988; Carbonell, 1983b; Carbonell, 1983a ] </ref> , for example, the only method of evaluation seems to be determining whether the analogy allowed the system to solve the problem; the system maps and tries to reason with any analogy given to it.

Reference-contexts: Spreading activation is used most often as a psychological model of associative memory [ Holland et al., 1986; Anderson, 1983; Collins and Loftus, 1975 ] , but it has also been used as a method of computer information retrieval in networks without regard to psychological plausibility <ref> [ Rau, 1987a; Cohen and Kjeldsen, 1987 ] </ref> . It has been used to retrieve concepts according to many different similarity criteria; in particular, it has been used as analogy 3.1. <p> THEORETICAL ANALYSIS search along the links of the semantic network. But in practice, SA's search can controlled, both in KDSA (by KDSA's search control component) and in other approaches <ref> [ Rau, 1987a; Cohen and Kjeldsen, 1987 ] </ref> . However, these search control approaches easily fit within the model presented here of SA as blind search. <p> IDA's method of dividing the search into a series of controlled sub-searches provides such a method.

The first aspect of mapping to consider is: how does the system decide which items in the target and base representations to place in correspondence? Gentner's systematic-ity principle <ref> [ Gentner, 1983 ] </ref> isolates isomorphism as the primary factor in mapping by preferring to map connected causal substructures of the target and base and leave isolated unconnected features unmapped.

For some approaches (e.g., Greiner's formalism <ref> [ Greiner, 1988 ] </ref> or Carbonell's Derivational Analogy [ Carbonell, 1983a ] ), this metric more or less measures only whether the transfer step allowed the system to draw a desired inference. <p> The transfer step will not necessarily involve direct copying of a component|it may be modified in some way during the transfer procedure.

Reference-contexts: A number of techniques have proven useful in speeding up state space search: (1) Performing heuristic evaluations of generated states, preferring to expand high-rated states over low-rated ones (used in A fl <ref> [ Hart et al., 1968 ] </ref> and hill-climbing search [ Pearl and Korf, 1987 ] ). (2) Pruning states from the search that are low-rated (used in beam search [ Lowerre and Reddy, 1980 ] ). (3) Restarting search (i.e., wiping out the record of the previously expanded portion of the

INTRODUCTION possibly "stumbling across a solution", i.e., being reminded of an analogue by external or internal cues. The important components of the retrieval system are discussed in more detail below. <p> Here we assume that the agent's problem solving executes by continuously triggering, evaluating, and executing rules in the manner of BB1 <ref> [ Hayes-Roth, 1990 ] </ref> , Soar [ Laird et al., 1987 ] , or any number of other AI architectures, and that the agent receives information from the world through sensors.

There are many important facets of BB1 that allow it to support a wide variety of reasoning and interacting with the world.

Reference-contexts: Without a strong agreement between knowledge representation and search control, IDA is likely to have the same kind of performance problems in large knowledge bases. Holland et. al.'s PI The PI system by Holland and his colleagues <ref> [ Holland et al., 1986 ] </ref> is a general cognitive architecture capable of many different methods of reasoning and learning. Holyoak and Thagard have proposed a complete model of analogy within the PI framework. This model retrieves analogies by spreading activation in a network of frame-like objects.

Reference-contexts: This is the opposite of analogies based on a high degree of surface similarity, where the two concepts have a number of features that match exactly. Since people tend to retrieve analogies based primarily on surface similarity <ref> [ Holyoak and Koh, 1987 ] </ref> , the definition given for an SDA does seem to meet Koestler's criterion for bisociation|it involves two concepts not normally thought of as connected. 2.3 Human Use of SDAs Despite Holyoak and Koh's (and others') finding that people generally retrieve analogies based on surface similarities,

Reference-contexts: In particular, the method of reducing search by using promising concepts as beacons in IDA is not included in PI's model of analogy retrieval. The problem of control in PI is discussed in [ Thagard et al., 1990 ] . Jones's EUREKA EUREKA <ref> [ Jones, 1989 ] </ref> is another general cognitive architecture which uses spreading activation to retrieve concepts from long-term memory. Memory is organized in a semantic network, and retrieval of concepts is accomplished by an ACT*-like spread of activation along the network's links.

Reference-contexts: Finally, it is important to identify differences between this analysis and other similar search analyses, particularly Knoblock's analysis of two-level hierarchical planning <ref> [ Knoblock, 1991 ] </ref> . Both this analysis and Knoblock's analysis are concerned with evaluating the effort saved by identifying intermediate states in the search which can be taken as new search starting points, i.e., points at which all other active nodes in the search can be erased.

Reference-contexts: At least one researcher has identified having a wide range of interdisciplinary knowledge as a prerequisite of a good inventor <ref> [ Kock, 1978 ] </ref> . (2) In the analogies that are made, differences between the analogous concepts are as important as similarities.

Reference-contexts: The literature on invention is full of examples of inventions that were guided by semantically distant analogies. Gutenberg invented the printing press after noticing the connection between applying force to impress script on paper and applying force to squeeze grapes in a wine press <ref> [ Koestler, 1965 ] </ref> . Edison's invention of the quadruplex telegraph was based almost entirely on an analogy to a water system of pumps, pipes, valves, and water wheels [ Hughes, 1971 ] . <p> For the purposes of this discussion, a knowledge base will consist of a collection of definitions of concepts or types. Each concept will be defined as a set of relations between instances, 1 Koestler <ref> [ Koestler, 1965 ] </ref> termed the process of connecting normally unconnected concepts "bisociation"; he believed this process to play a role in all creative thought. We argue shortly that SDAs qualify as one type of bisociation. 2.2. <p> Upon attending a wine festival, he encountered the workings of the wine press. Immediately he recognized that the same mechanism which applied and then removed steady pressure to grapes could be used to apply type to paper and remove it to avoid smudging <ref> [ Koestler, 1965 ] </ref> . * Many inventors working on a flying machine in the early part of this century were unable to get their inventions off the ground because they tried to restrict the pilot's control to only one axis of motion. <p> Koestler's idea of bisociation, which he views as characteristic of all creativity, reflects this ability <ref> [ Koestler, 1965 ] </ref> .

Kolodner <ref> [ Kolodner, 1991 ] </ref> outlines the index selection procedure this way: First, determine what the case could be useful for. Second, determine under what circumstances the case would be useful for each of these tasks. Third, massage the circumstances to make them as recognizable and generally applicable as possible.

Reference-contexts: In this way KDSA can use these promising concepts as beacons along the way to the final good analogy. This is very similar to the way that promising intermediate states are used in heuristic search techniques such as hill-climbing or best-first search <ref> [ Pearl and Korf, 1987 ] </ref> . The use of the matching component of the mechanism to provide feedback to the spreading activation search provides a key distinguishing feature of our approach. <p> A number of techniques have proven useful in speeding up state space search: (1) Performing heuristic evaluations of generated states, preferring to expand high-rated states over low-rated ones (used in A fl [ Hart et al., 1968 ] and hill-climbing search <ref> [ Pearl and Korf, 1987 ] </ref> ).
