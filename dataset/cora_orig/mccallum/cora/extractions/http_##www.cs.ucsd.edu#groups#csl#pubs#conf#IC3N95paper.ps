Abstract: We propose a new scheduling policy, called SCED (Service Curve-based Earliest Deadline first), which provides guarantees to virtual circuits in packet-switched networks. This scheduling policy is developed for a general framework for service provisioning based on Service Curves proposed by Cruz. Instead of explicitly guaranteeing a specific quality of service measure, such as maximum delay, SCED guarantees the service curve for a connection. Quality of service guarantees for the connection can then be expressed as simple functions of the service curve guarantee and the traffic burstiness constraint of the connection. A simple and convenient condition under which SCED can simultaneously guarantee a set of service curves is proved. The service curve specification gives greater flexibility to a server in allocating its resources to meet diverse delay and throughput requirements. We demonstrate by an example that SCED provides a larger schedula-bility region than scheduling policies such as Virtual-Clock and PGPS with rate proportional assignment.

Reference-contexts: The guarantees for a connection are usually expressed as complex functions of the traffic constraints of all connections. Hence, when the traffic constraints of a connection change, the guarantees for that connection change as well as those for other connections. Cruz [5] (see also <ref> [4] </ref>) introduced the notion of service curves and proposed their use as a general framework for service characterization.

Reference-contexts: Using this discipline, each packet is assigned a deadline which is equal to the arrival time of the packet plus a specified maximum delay. Packets are served in increasing order of deadlines. This discipline has been recently shown <ref> [9] </ref> to provide the largest possible schedulability region for a set of connections, each of which specifies a burstiness constraint and a maximum delay. Hence, if a scheduling discipline such as SCED can schedule a set of connections, so can NPEDF.

In order to provide guarantees, most scheduling policies specify some constraints on the input traffic of each connection, such as minimum interarrival time between packets and maximum packet size. <p> In Table 1 the deadlines and departures using VirtualClock are given and we can see that C1 suffers a maximum delay of 1 slot as required, but C2 has a maximum delay of 6 slots, a violation of the delay requirement of C2. Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) <ref> [13] </ref> specifies a non-negative parameter for each connection which determines the minimum fraction of bandwidth given to the connection during backlogged periods. <p> A connection which has a small average rate, but requires a small maximum delay may be assigned a large in order to meet its delay requirement. A procedure for assigning 's for a set of connections with different burstiness and delay constraints was given in <ref> [13] </ref>. However, due to differences between their model and ours, we resort to an ad-hoc method. Constraining 1 + 2 = 1, we assign 2 the smallest value possible which can still provide a maximum delay of 1 slot for C1 for the arrival pattern in Table 1.

The computation of V T is very similar to that of auxV C in VirtualClock <ref> [19] </ref>, except for the resetting of the variable to zero every time the server is empty and the subtraction of one which accounts for the "cut-through" nature of our model. <p> The SCED deadlines and departure slots corresponding to the example's arrival pattern are given in Table 1, from which we can see that the delay requirements of C1 and C2 are satisfied. The VirtualClock <ref> [19] </ref> policy schedules packets in the following manner. For each connection i, the server maintains a variable auxV C i which is initialized with zero.
