Abstract: A draft of this paper should be available from Menon by December 1995.) Abstract Over the past few years of research on exact representations of sculptured solids in dual [Brep, CSG] representation schemes [1, 2, 3] we have discovered some intricate relationships among the mathematical conditions that govern Brep and CSG solids built with low degree algebraic surfaces. This paper provides a mathematical framework that, for the first time, weaves in a coherent fashion what we perceive to be some of the key issues in this area. A Brep is constructed by an Interpolating Polyhedral Smoothing (IPS) technique that interpolates the vertices and vertex normals of an input polyhedron P . Given P , we build a polyhedral hull as a triangulated polytope of face and edge tetrahedra. Algebraic patches are defined in the Bernstein-Bezier form (BB-form) within each tetrahedron. The control net for the surface consists of interpolative control points (vertices of P ) and non-interpolative control points (apexes of tetrahedra). The mathematical framework consists of two main parts: (a) initial solid construction, and (b) shape control operations. Broadly speaking, the set of constraints related to the initial solid construction have to guarantee: (a) polyhedral hull validity (both local and global), (b) self-separating trunctets, and (c) quasi-disjoint subshells. Constraints related to shape control essentially deal with incremental techniques to update and validate above properties. In particular, we introduce: (a) the concept of finite-extent decompositions for Brep-to-CSG conversion, that have practical significance in dual [Brep, CSG] architectures, and (b) an analogy between shape control operations on algebraic and parametric patches.
