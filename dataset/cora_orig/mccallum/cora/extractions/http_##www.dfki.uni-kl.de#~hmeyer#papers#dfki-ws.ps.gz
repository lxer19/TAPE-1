Reference-contexts: DFKI Workshop on Constraint Processing 1996 9 Choose the variable, that will be labeled next: E.g. the minimal remaining values heuristic chooses the variable with the smallest pruned domain, that will be labeled next. It aims to label the variables consecutively, that interfere strongly <ref> [Bacchus and van Run, 1995] </ref>. When several variables have pruned domains of equal size, it is conceivable to consider the propagation of soft constraints to determine the variable, that will be labeled next.

Reference-contexts: DFKI Workshop on Constraint Processing 1996 10 Locally consistent domains are well known to include all labels, that are part of complete labelings satisfying all constraints. For problems with hypertrees as constraint graphs, locally consistent domains are known to contain only labels, that appear in solutions of the CSP <ref> [Mackworth, 1977, Freuder, 1982, Freuder, 1990, Bessiere, 1992] </ref>. Thus, and because they can be computed efficiently, locally consistent domains are often used to prune the search space either before starting search or for looking ahead.

Reference-contexts: This made the representation of optional requirements easier but not simple. Generally, several approaches have been proposed to specify the merit of labelings by soft constraints: * prioritized resp. possibilistic constraints [Schiex, 1992], * weighted constraints (PCSP) [Freuder, 1989, Freuder and Wallace, 1992], * constraint hierarchies <ref> [Borning et al., 1989, Wilson, 1993] </ref>, * fuzzy constraints [Guesgen, 1994, Dubois et al., 1993]. Each of these approaches has its own characteristics and, thus, can be distinguished according to the ability to represent optional requirements or certain aspects of uncertainty. <p> Hierarchy levels: Discussions with domain experts showed that hierarchical constraint orderings are appropriate to represent the preferences occurring in the domain. We employed a constraint ordering equivalent to the ordering implied by Borning's weightedsumbetter-predicate <ref> [Borning et al., 1989] </ref>, because most requirements are related to a cost measure. <p> Cost reduction is a problem, where an absolute measure of preference does exist and should be exploited. 3.4 Hierarchical Constraint Preferences Hierarchical constraint preferences have been suggested to introduce soft constraints into constraint logic programming <ref> [Borning et al., 1989, Wilson, 1993] </ref>. The corresponding paradigm is called hierarchical constraint logic programming (HCLP). A priority index p is assigned to each constraint. The set of all constraints C is partitioned into subsets of equal priority: the hierarchy levels.

Prioritized constraints may be appropriate to deal with such problems. The preference ordering of prioritized constraints is neither strictly monotonous nor appropriate to represent a cost reduction requirement. Obviously, priorities are a global scale of preference.

These so called fuzzy constraints [Snow and Freuder, 1990, Guesgen, 1994] are strongly related to possibilistic constraints <ref> [Dubois et al., 1993] </ref>. It is also conceivable to use functions to abbreviate PCSPs. These functions may be used to express an error, that depends on the labels of some variables in V . Harald Meyer auf'm Hofe: Representation of Requirements. . . <p> All remaining methods demand such an absolute scale. The processing of these levels of preference assume "commensurability between preference levels pertaining to different constraints, i.e. the user who specifies the constraints must describe them by means of a unique preference scale" <ref> [Dubois et al., 1993] </ref>. The approximation of preference among qualitative requirements by such an absolute global scale of preference demands a general view of the domain expert on all possible requirements, that additionally reflects conflicts or implications between constraints, to avoid unexpected behaviour of the system.

Reference-contexts: This determines the width of the corresponding constraint hypergraph (either the number of days in the planning period or the number of nurses at the ward). With respect to known results referring to the complexity of search <ref> [Freuder, 1982] </ref> we cannot guarantee to search effectively without backtracking, because the width of the constraint hypergraph is too large.

Reference-contexts: To describe their semantics, soft constraints are usually considered to specify an ordering &gt; among complete labelings of the variables in V . A labeling is considered to be a solution of a problem involving soft constraints, if it is among the &gt;-smallest labelings <ref> [Satoh, 1990] </ref>. &gt; may be seen as a relative merit of a labeling. Several ways have been proposed up to now to formulate problems with soft constraints. On the one hand, the approaches differ in the way, the restrictions on labelings are expressed.

Reference-contexts: A set of constraints is more important than its O-smaller sets. O-large sets of constraints are preferred to be satisfied. This is the basic idea of the unifying view on soft constraints, presented in this paper. This view is in contrast to valued constraint satisfaction <ref> [Schiex et al., 1995] </ref> restricted to problems, whose constraints are either satisfied or not (that can not be partially satisfied). On the other hand this loss in generality makes presentation much easier.

Reference-contexts: Searching for a solution in constructive problems is often treated as a CSP. The objective of constructive problems, like scheduling and configuration tasks, is generating a solution | a time schedule resp. the description of a machine | from initially specified requirements <ref> [Wache and Abecker, 1996] </ref>. When such problems are given as a CSP, the constraints represent the specified requirements as well as general knowledge.
