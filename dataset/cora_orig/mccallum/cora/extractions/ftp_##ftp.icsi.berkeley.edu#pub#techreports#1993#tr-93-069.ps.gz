Abstract: We propose an alternative definition for the speedup of parallel algorithms. Let A be a sequential algorithm and B a parallel algorithm for solving the same problem. If A and/or B are randomized or if we are interested in their performance on a probability distribution of problem instances, the running times are described by random variables T A and T B . The speedup is usually defined as E[T A ]=E[T B ] where E is the arithmetic mean. This notion of speedup delivers just a number, i.e. much information about the distribution is lost. For example, there is no variance of the speedup. To define a measure for possible fluctuations of the speedup, a new notion of speedup is required. The basic idea is to define speedup as M (T A =T B ) where the functional form of M has to be determined. Also, we argue that in many cases M (T A =T B ) is more informative than E[T A ]=E[T B ] for a typical user of A and B. We present a set of intuitive axioms that any speedup function M (T A =T B ) must fulfill and prove that the geometric mean is the only solution. As a result, we now have a uniquely defined speedup function that will allow the user of an improved system to talk about the average performance improvement as well as about its possible variations. Keywords: Speedup, variation of running time, geometric mean, functional equations, randomized algorithms.

Reference-contexts: As an immediate consequence of B3 and A1 we get the symmetry A2. Thus, in the following we can use A1 and A2 to prove Theorem 2.

Reference-contexts: Lemma 3 A Function F : IR k + ! IR + is solution of A1, A2, B1, B2 and B3 if and only if it is a quasiarithmetic mean. There are other characterisations of the quasiarithmetic mean, (see e.g.[AA86], or <ref> [AS83] </ref>, which replace B3 by different properties, but at least in the present context, they are much less natural than B3. The next lemma completes the proof of Theorem 2. Lemma 4 The only homogeneous quasiarithmetic mean that satisfies B5 is the geometric mean. <p> The next lemma completes the proof of Theorem 2.

Reference-contexts: This shows that A2 is a very strong (restrictive) axiom which will make the proof of Lemma 1 very easy. A formal verifikation of the strength of A2 can be found in <ref> [Rob90] </ref>, Theorem 1. One might think of generalisations of A2; however as we will see below there is a very natural, but weaker axiom A2', which is still sufficient to characterize the geometric mean.
