Abstract: It is proposed to conceive of representation as an emergent phenomenon that is supervenient on patterns of activity of coarsely tuned and highly redundant feature detectors. The computational underpinnings of the outlined concept of representation are (1) the properties of collections of overlapping graded receptive fields, as in the biological perceptual systems that exhibit hyperacuity-level performance, and (2) the sufficiency of a set of proximal distances between stimulus representations for the recovery of the corresponding distal contrasts between stimuli, as in multidimensional scaling. The present preliminary study appears to indicate that this concept of representation is computationally viable, and is compatible with psychological and neurobiological data. Keywords: vision, categorization, representation, similarity, receptive fields, multidimensional scaling, feature spaces.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the discovery of a class of (presumably ephemerally represented) objects immune to visual, as opposed to the ever-present "semantic," priming would strongly support such distinction. The nature of what I have chosen to call ephemeral representations is well summarized by the following passage from <ref> (Barsalou, 1987) </ref>: Concepts as constructs. Instead of viewing long-term memory as being divided into invariant concepts, it may make more sense to view long-term memory as containing large amounts of highly interrelated and "continuous" knowledge that is used to construct concepts in working memory.

Reference-contexts: When MDS is applied as a tool for the study of internal representations, care must be taken to ensure that its basic assumptions are satisfied (e.g., that it makes sense to assume that the representation space is metric, etc; <ref> (Beals et al., 1968) </ref>). Unlike in the application of MDS in psychophysics, where the inference is from the derived overt measurements to the primary structure of the hidden inner space, in perception the purported inference is from the derived inner (proximal) similarities to the primary distal ones.

Reference-contexts: This multiple-"observer" approach appears to provide a realistic basis for the modeling of statistical aspects of perception. Real perceptual systems rarely have the chance to experience a given stimulus repeatedly <ref> (Bialek et al., 1991) </ref>, hence the value of a simultaneous analysis of the input via a number of parallel channels.

Reference-contexts: This line of reasoning is developed, e.g., in <ref> (Biederman and Cooper, 1991) </ref>, where it is argued that recognition priming at the level of object parts, or geons, constitutes evidence in favor of physically explicit geon-level representations. There are two remarks to be made at this point.

Reference-contexts: Each persistent prototype may be represented by a set of detectors, implemented by receptive field-like mechanisms tuned to a number of the object's views <ref> (Poggio and Edelman, 1990) </ref>, and may be constructed in a self-organizing fashion following mere exposure to the object (Edelman and Weinshall, 1991). <p> When two such objects rotate in space, the image-plane distance between their chosen views (defined, e.g., as the sum of distances between corresponding points) changes smoothly with rotation, but does not change monotonically. 8 Interestingly, there are psychophysical indications <ref> (Edelman and Bulthoff, 1990) </ref> that subjects find it more difficult to generalize over rotation in depth than over other transformations that are not even rigid, such as 3D shear (note that shear causes a monotonic increase in the 2D pointwise distance to a reference or prototype view). <p> views of the same object, where the smoothness assumption is warranted over the entire range of possible rotations (Ullman and Basri, 1991), but the monotonicity only holds for a relatively small range of views around a given reference view, a straightforward application of HBF appears to be a useful strategy <ref> (Poggio and Edelman, 1990) </ref>. On the other hand, in the classification of potentially unfamiliar objects, where in general there is no theoretical guarantee of the applicability of HBF approximation, the reliance on monotonic transduction and a Chorus-like scheme may be a more acceptable approach. The required number of prototypes. <p> The reasons for this decision are derived from the availability of biologically motivated models that can support invariance to rigid transformations and to scaling (Schwartz, 1985; Anderson and Essen, 1987), or tolerate rotation in depth by learning to compensate for it from examples <ref> (Poggio and Edelman, 1990) </ref>. The possibility of discounting such transformations prior to dealing with shape is actually beneficial for the present model. A more intriguing idea is that of mutability of the receptive fields in the shape space itself.

Smoothness vs. monotonic covariation. In HBF, the shape of the basis functions is determined by the kind of smoothness assumption on the class of target functions that are to be approximated <ref> (Poggio and Girosi, 1990) </ref>. Similarly, in Chorus it is required that the physical description of an object change smoothly as it becomes less and less like the prototype of its class.

When such warping occurs, associations acquired through experience or instruction may affect the structure of the representational space by tying together some of its points that normally are far apart.

Reference-contexts: The condition is that of stimulus specificity, which figures prominently in the recent resurgence of work on perceptual learning (Sagi and Tanne, 1994). If the processing savings due to prior exposure do not transfer from one stimulus to another (despite these being merely rotated versions of the same pattern <ref> (Poggio et al., 1992) </ref>), then it is highly likely that a well-defined representation of the first stimulus is involved. 6 The second remark has to do with the amenability of the physical nature of the persistent repre-sentation mechanism to neurophysiological study.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a perceptual system does well insofar as it succeeds to represent internally the similarities between different stimuli. The problem in understanding how biological perceptual systems represent similarity, and in building artificial systems that do so, is that the notion of perceptual similarity is notoriously difficult to formalize <ref> (Quine, 1969) </ref>. It has been pointed out repeatedly, by C. S. Peirce and others, that definitions in terms of shared or contrastive properties only beg the question of property selection.

Reference-contexts: Psychophysical findings on synthetic 3D object recognition (Cutzu and Edelman, 1992) and on face discrimination <ref> (Rhodes, 1988) </ref> in human subjects confirm the relevance of low-dimensional approaches.

Thus, one way to understand, on the computational level, how faces can be represented in a low-dimensional space is to find out how sex and age can be determined from a face image | a formidable task by itself.

Reference-contexts: Other objects, for which no specially selective cells have been found, may be represented ephemerally.

Reference-contexts: Findings of such plasticity of receptive fields in shape space should eventually determine the degree of permanence of the persistent representations postulated by Chorus. 9 Notably, a massive increase in the incidence of IT cells selective to a set of shapes was found after prolonged exposure to the chosen shapes <ref> (Tanaka, 1993) </ref>. 13 4.6 Philosophical considerations The central philosophical statement of Chorus, being largely an allusion to Locke's notion of representation by covariation, has to do with the problem of distal knowledge.

Reference-contexts: The same pitfall associated with the concept of similarity is illustrated by the following theorem due to Watanabe (1985): "Any two objects are as similar to each other as any other two objects, insofar as the degree of similarity is measured by the number of shared predicates." 1 Watanabe's conclusion <ref> (see also Tversky, 1977) </ref> is that different weights must be assigned to different predicates. This, however, merely shifts the focus of the problem to the choice of the appropriate weights.

Reference-contexts: Modelers nowadays tend to "solve" the binding problem by postulating mechanisms for biological implementation of abstract graphs, such as coupled oscillations that maintain phase lock across significant distances in the cortex (Hummel and Biederman, 1992). No evidence for such mechanisms has, however, been found in primates <ref> (Young et al., 1992) </ref>. Thus, a scheme that circumvents binding altogether (see Figure 4) enjoys the advantage of biological plausibility over the standard structural approaches. Invariances.
