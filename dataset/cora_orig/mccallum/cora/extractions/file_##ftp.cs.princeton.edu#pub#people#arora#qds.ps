Abstract: Quadratic Dynamical Systems (QDS), whose definition extends that of Markov chains, are used to model phenomena in a variety of fields like statistical physics and natural evolution. Such systems also play a role in genetic algorithms, a widely-used class of heuristics that are notoriously hard to analyze. Recently Rabinovich et al. took an important step in the study of QDS's by showing, under some technical assumptions, that such systems converge to a stationary distribution (similar theorems for Markov Chains are well-known). We show, however, that the following sampling problem for QDS's is PSPACE-hard: Given an initial distribution, produce a random sample from the t'th generation. The hardness result continues to hold for very restricted classes of QDS's with very simple initial distributions, thus suggesting that QDS's are intrinsically more complicated than Markov chains.

Reference-contexts: Classical research on QDS's often focusses on the study of fixed points i.e., distributions in equilibrium. However, computational applications require upper bounds on the rate of convergence to equilibrium. For instance, applications of Markov chains in computer science <ref> [AKS, JS, DFK] </ref> were made possible by new techniques for analyzing convergence rates. By contrast, QDS's do not necessarily converge to a stationary distribution. However, many QDS's arising in applications use a symmetric mating rule (see the next subsection for definitions).

They analyzed the equilibrium distributions and the rate of convergence of a QDS related to the problem of counting matchings in trees.

Reference-contexts: We initially suspected this chaotic behaviour was the reason why QDS's are hard to simulate. However, Moni Naor has recently noted that our NP-hard system of section 2 can be modified into a non-chaotic one <ref> [Nao] </ref>. We do not know whether the same is true for the PSPACE-hard system given later. In some independent work, Pudlak [Pud] has also shown the PSPACE-hardness of simulating non-symmetric QDS's (this corresponds to our Section 4). He does not extend the result to symmetric QDS's, however.

Reference-contexts: But infinite (or even very large) population sizes are infeasible in real genetic algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The map is quadratic in that two random samples are picked independently from D to produce a random sample from D 0 according to some fixed mating rule fi. A classical use of the QDS model in physics is Boltzmann's treatment of the kinetic gas model of Maxwell (see <ref> [Rei] </ref>). The result of collisions between pairs of molecules can be described by a mating rule derived from the laws of Newto-nian mechanics.
