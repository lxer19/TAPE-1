Title: Formulating 3D Contact Dynamics Problems  
Author: Mihai Anitescu James F. Cremer Florian A. Potra 
Abstract: October, 1995 REPORTS ON COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS, NO. 80/1995, DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS, THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA Abstract Complementarity formulations are a promising approach for solving dynamic multi-rigid-body contact problems. Here, we address two aspects of simulating contact in a complementarity setting. First, we develop an explicit formulation of the differential equations governing contact points for bodies of general surface geometry. These equations may be used to integrate the contact position and to set up the basic dynamics equations. Second, we present an efficient method for handling frictionless planar contacts of arbitrary boundary shape. Throughout, we attempt to set up the problem as explicitly as possible, paying special attention to the way the contact geometry is related to the dynamics.

Reference-contexts: In the present paper we will employ the complementarity approach, although we will assume that the forces are continous. Special situations allowing for discontinuities will be investigated in a future paper. The complementarity approach appears to provide a satisfactory solution to many of the problems encountered by simulation systems <ref> [6, 1, 10] </ref>. However, several problems arise though when using such an approach . For instance, setting up the problem assumes that the contact constraints can be cast as a few easily available 5 degree-of-freedom (DOF) constraints (e.g. point-on-plane, edge-on-edge). <p> For detailed discussions of Linear Complementarity approaches see <ref> [6, 1, 10] </ref>. For a discussion of the origin of the problem and extensive bibliography, see [10]. The issue of arbitrary shaped contacts in a general setting has received significant previous attention, especially in the area of robotics. <p> Montana [7] derived explicit contact point evolution equations for surface-surface constraints, based on the geometric parameters of the surfaces. Cai and Roth [11] developed similar equations in an implicit setting and discuss the situation where one of the shapes is a curve as a limit case. Baraff <ref> [1] </ref> has used an implicit type approach in the context of a complementarity setting of the contact problem. In this paper we extend the formulations from [7] and [8] to find the equations of the closest points on the bodies for the case the bodies are not necessarily in contact. <p> It is then useful, in order not to run into kinematic inconsistencies, to define the "extremal distance" and the "extremal points" <ref> [1, p.298] </ref>. <p> We have chosen a different formal definition of the extremal points than <ref> [1] </ref> because of the need to accommodate contact situations that involve curves. <p> A related approach has been used in 3D arbitrary shaped contact simulation where the motion of the contact points is described as constrained motion and the contact velocities are retrieved via the implicit function theorem <ref> [1] </ref>. The other approach, which we will use in this paper, assumes that the contact configurations are described with local charts and, if a surface is involved, a local orthonormal frame is at hand [7, 8, 9]. <p> It is not necessary to require that the matrix from (2.6) be nonsingular. But, we need some procedure to ensure that the forces from (2.6) are continuous (see for instance <ref> [1] </ref>), for otherwise it becomes difficult to foresee the way the contact will break. 5.2 Integration strategy for arbitrary-shaped planar contacts We assume that the bodies involved in the contact have been in contact for some finite time and that at the beginning of the simulation we will obtain solutions consistent

Reference-contexts: For each contact the complementarity relation (2.2) must hold. Thus, s i i = 0; 1 i m. By adding up the relations (2:2) for all the contact constraints, we get s T = 0; s; 0: (2.7) The relations (2.7) and (2.6) determine a linear complementarity problem <ref> [2] </ref>. It is known that the problem has a unique q as a solution, but the forces and need not be unique.

Reference-contexts: C f is defined analogously. L o (o ) and L f (o ) respectively are the families of frames associated with each body, such that at time t L o (t) coincides with the Frenet trihedron <ref> [3] </ref> on the body O's curve. L f (t) coincides with the Frenet trihedron on body F 's curve. OE o is the angle defined by L o (t) and C o , measured around the common x axis. <p> H fl f = [ ~ t~n ~ b] the Frenet frame or Frenet trihedron <ref> [3, p.19] </ref> of the curve in local coordinates, thus with respect to body F . Ad g fl f is now found by (A.4) after replacing the corresponding expressions of p fl f and H fl f .

Reference-contexts: Thus, we use a point-plane constraint for each vertex of the base. For completeness, assume that the system has, in addition to contact constraints, L joint-type constraints defined by the map fi (q) taking the configuration space to R L . For details concerning joint constraints see, for example, <ref> [4] </ref>. With these two maps, we can formulate the contact problem: Problem Given the positions q and velocities _q of a set of bodies, find the accelerations that define a motion consistent with the following equality and inequality constraints. (q) 0 (2.4) 2 It is known [4] that for frictionless cases <p> constraints see, for example, <ref> [4] </ref>. With these two maps, we can formulate the contact problem: Problem Given the positions q and velocities _q of a set of bodies, find the accelerations that define a motion consistent with the following equality and inequality constraints. (q) 0 (2.4) 2 It is known [4] that for frictionless cases the direction of the constraint force is perpendicular to the manifold defining the constraint surface. Thus the forces due to active contact constraints are of the type q (q) T where is the vector of the contact forces.

Reference-contexts: Many systems exhibit physical inconsistencies that are glaringly apparent to the user due to a poor treatment of loss of contact and multiple contacts between bodies. The approach of classical dynamics simulation is to consider this problem as a piecewise differential algebraic equation (DAE, see Haug <ref> [5] </ref>), using the sign of the constraint force as a test to decide if the respective contact will break or not. This approach implicitly assumes that the contact forces are continuous with respect to time.

Reference-contexts: This approach implicitly assumes that the contact forces are continuous with respect to time. Another approach initiated by Lotstedt in his Ph.D thesis (see also <ref> [6] </ref>) consists in formulating the multi-rigid-body contact problem as a complementarity problem. The latter approach works, in special cases, even if the contact forces are discontinuous.

Because we are dealing only with body velocities, we drop the superscript b once again.

In this subsection we will discuss the singularity to get some intuition about it. If both bodies are locally strictly convex, the matrix is always positive definite, thus nonsingular. If both are locally strictly concave, then the pair of points cannot be a minimum-distance pair. <p> The authors would like to thank Jeff Trinkle for carefully reading the manuscript and spotting several misprints. A The algebra of relative velocities We will describe shortly the algebra of relative velocities from <ref> [8] </ref> that we will use in order to describe the equations of the contact. The relative position of two frames , say a; b is described by the position vector p ab and by the relative rotation matrix R ab .
