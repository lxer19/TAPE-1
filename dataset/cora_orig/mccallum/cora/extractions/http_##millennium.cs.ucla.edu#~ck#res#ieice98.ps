Title: THE ODD-EVEN ATM SWITCH 7  
Keyword: References  
Note: 5. Conclusion  
Abstract: we have the regular pure input-buffered switch. In our comparison we consider a Look-ahead scheme with a window of w = 2. We feel that a window of two makes it comparable to the Odd-Even model where contention resolution also consists of two rounds (one for polling the odd and one for polling the even queues). Also, note that in both strategies only one cell can be cleared from a single input port (there is not any speed-up feature). Figure 3 illustrates how all three models, namely the Odd-Even, the Look-ahead and the regular one compare, assuming Bernoulli arrivals. We see that the throughputs of the Odd-Even and the Look-ahead are very close. However as traffic becomes more bursty (which means that cell arrivals are correlated) this is not any longer true. The Odd-Even performs much better, since a window of w = 2 for Look-ahead does not provide much of a benefit (see figure 9). In this paper we have described an innovative crossbar, input-buffered ATM switch, the Odd-Even switch, which allows incoming cells to be stored in either of the two FIFOs placed in every input port, according to their destination, namely odd or even. Its performance has been quite extensively examined and compared it to the simple input-queueing switch under various traffic conditions. Furthermore, we compared the Odd-Even model to the Look-ahead scheme for which we assumed a window of w = 2, in order to make the latter comparable to the Odd-Even. In all cases, it has been demonstrated that the Odd-Even can achieve a noteworthy gain of more than 20% in throughput over the regular input-buffered switch. Other performance results (with respect to mean waiting times, cell drop ratios) clearly suggest a superior performance of the Odd-Even switch over the ordinary input-buffered switch. We recognize that the Odd-Even switch may require additional hardware and complexity (e.g. input controller, more complex arbitrator), however it is still simple in its implementation and effective in terms of performance. We have expanded the idea of the Odd-Even switching scheme to include multiple (instead of just two) input FIFO queues connected to the same input port. This led us to introducing the Multiple Input-Queueing switch which we study in [4]. As an additional application of the Odd-Even switch we mention the use of this dual input-queueing strategy in the buffered-banyan multistage interconnection networks. This has resulted in us proposing a high-performance switching network architecture which we call the Dual-Banyan (DB) switch (cf. [5]). [1] M. G. Hluchyj and M. J.

Christos Kolias received his B.S. degree in mathematics from the University of Athens, Greece in 1989. In 1991 he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship. Since then he has been with the Department of Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where he is pursuing his Ph.D. in the area of Computer Networks and Communications. He received the M.S. and Engineers degrees both in Computer Science from UCLA in 1993 and 1995 respectively. His current research interests are in the area of Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and in particular of ATM switching. Other interests include wireless ATM, queueing systems and applications, performance evaluation. Leonard Kleinrock,a father of the Internet, received his B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the City College of New York in 1957 and the M.S.E.E. and Ph.D.E.E. degrees from M.I.T. in 1959 and 1963, respectively. He is currently a Professor in the Computer Science Department at UCLA. His research interests focus on nomadic computing and performance evaluation and design of many kinds of networks (e.g. packet switching networks, packet radio networks, local area networks, metropolitan area networks, broadband and gigabit networks) and of parallel, wireless and distributed systems. Dr. Kleinrock is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, an IEEE Fellow, a Guggenheim Fellow, recipient of the Swedish L.M. Ericsson Prize, of the 12th Marconi Award and of the UCLA Distinguished Teaching and Faculty Research Lecturer Awards.
