Abstract: Severe contamination of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity by eye movements, blinks, muscle, heart and line noise is a serious problem for EEG interpretation and analysis. Rejecting contaminated EEG segments results in a considerable loss of information and may be impractical for clinical data. Many methods have been proposed to remove eye movement and blink artifacts from EEG recordings. Often regression in the time or frequency domain is performed on simultaneous EEG and electrooculographic (EOG) recordings to derive parameters characterizing the appearance and spread of EOG artifacts in the EEG channels. However, EOG records also contain brain signals [1, 2], so regressing out EOG activity inevitably involves subtracting a portion of the relevant EEG signal from each recording as well. Regression cannot be used to remove muscle noise or line noise, since these have no reference channels. Here, we propose a new and generally applicable method for removing a wide variety of artifacts from EEG records. The method is based on an extended version of a previous Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm [3, 4] for performing blind source separation on linear mixtures of independent source signals with either sub-Gaussian or super-Gaussian distributions. Our results show that ICA can effectively detect, separate and remove activity in EEG records from a wide variety of artifactual sources, with results comparing favorably to those obtained using regression-based methods.

Reference-contexts: We present here a new and generally applicable method for isolating and removing a wide variety of EEG artifacts by linear decomposition using a new Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm [4] related to a previous algorithm <ref> [3, 12] </ref>. The ICA method is based on spatial filtering and does not rely on having a "clean"reference channel. It effectively decomposes multiple-channel EEG data into spatially-fixed and temporally independent components. <p> Clean EEG signals can then be derived by eliminating the contributions of artifactual sources, since their time courses are generally temporally independent from and differently distributed than sources of EEG activity. 2 Independent Component Analysis Bell and Sejnowski <ref> [3] </ref> have proposed a simple neural network algorithm that blindly separates mixtures, x, of independent sources, s, using infomax. <p> This implies that the distribution of the output y i approximates a uniform density. Independence is achieved through the nonlinear squashing function which provides necessary higher-order statistics through its Taylor series expansion. The learning rule can be derived by maximizing output joint entropy, H (y), with respect to W <ref> [3] </ref>, giving, W / @W fi W (1) where ^p i = (@=@u i ) ln (@y i =@u i ). The `natural gradient' W T W term [13] avoids matrix inversions and speeds convergence. <p> The ideal form for g () is the cumulative density function (cdf) of the distributions of the independent sources. In practice, if we choose g () to be a sigmoid function (as in <ref> [3] </ref>), the algorithm is then limited to separating sources with super-Gaussian distributions. <p> in domains where, (1) the mixing medium is linear and propagation delays are negligible, (2) the time courses of the sources are independent, and (3) the number of sources is the same as the number of sensors, meaning if we employ N sensors the ICA algorithm can separate N sources <ref> [3, 4, 12] </ref>. In the case of EEG signals [12], volume conduction is thought to be linear and instantaneous, hence assumption (1) is satisfied. <p> Component 5 represents horizontal eye movements, while component 2 reveals the presence of small periodic muscle spiking in left frontal channels which is hard to see in the raw data. Line noise has a sub-Gaussian distribution and so could not be clearly isolated by earlier versions of the algorithm <ref> [3, 12] </ref>. By contrast, the new algorithm effectively concentrates the line noise present in nearly all the channels into ICA component 3. The widespread cardiac contamination in the EEG data (left) is concentrated in ICA component 4.

Reference-contexts: However, current interest in EEG in the 40-80 Hz gamma band phenomena may make this approach undesirable as well. We present here a new and generally applicable method for isolating and removing a wide variety of EEG artifacts by linear decomposition using a new Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> related to a previous algorithm [3, 12].

Reference-contexts: However, when limited data are available, or blinks and muscle movements occur too frequently, as in some patient groups, the amount of data lost to artifact rejection may be unacceptable. Methods are needed for removing artifacts while preserving the essential EEG signals. Berg & Scherg <ref> [5] </ref> have proposed a spatio-temporal dipole model for eye-artifact removal that requires a priori assumptions about the number of dipoles for saccade, blink, and other eye-movements, and assumes they have a simple dipolar structure.

Reference-contexts: Several other proposed methods for removing eye-movement artifacts are based on regression in the time domain <ref> [6, 7] </ref> or frequency domain [8, 9]. However, simple time-domain regression tends to overcompensate for blink artifacts and may introduce new artifacts into EEG records [10]. The cause of this overcompensation is the difference between the spatial EOG-to-EEG transfer functions for blinks and saccades.
