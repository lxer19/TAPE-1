Abstract: We present a careful evaluation of the sensor characteristics of the CyberGlove model CG1801 whole hand input device. In particular, we conducted an experimental study that investigated level of sensitivity of the sensors, their performance in recognizing angles, and factors that affect accuracy of recognition of flexion measurements. Among our results, we show that hand size differences between the subjects of the study did not have a statistical affect on the accuracy of the device. We also analyzed the effect of different software cal

Reference-contexts: In (Baudel and Beaudouin-Lafon, 1993), a more extensive hand gesture recognizing system is used to allow a presenter using a VPL DataGlove to control a computer generated slide projector. In <ref> (Chapin, et. al., 1992) </ref>, a system was described which uses a hand input device to drive a computer generated display of the users hand on a screen at the other end of a phone line.

Reference-contexts: in the study to produce a range (Figure 4) of each measurement of hand size that extended from the lower 5% to the 95% range for men for all measures and from the lower 5% to the 95% range for women in all measurements except hand length and hand breadth. <ref> (Hertzberg, 1972) </ref>. Experimental Design The experiment was done in three steps, each step using a different apparatus to constrain different sensors to particular angles.

Reference-contexts: METHOD Hand Input Device The hand input device used for this study was the CyberGlove model CG1801, produced by Virtual Technologies, Palo Alto, CA (CyberGlove User's Manual, 1992), shown in Figure 1 <ref> (also described in Kalawsky, 1993) </ref>. The glove has 18 sensors placed at critical points to measure the posture of the hand. The sensors are long, thin strips sewn into the glove fabric that measure the change in resistance to an electric current as the sensor is bent.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION The human hand is perhaps the most useful and diverse tool we use to interact with the environment around us. The hand is capable of both a powerful grip to push, pull, or twist objects; and a precise grip to twist and turn small objects or handles <ref> (Napier, 1980) </ref>. Along with speech and facial expression, hand gestures are used as one of the primary methods of communicating with the people and things of our world.

Reference-contexts: Using such a system at either end of the phone connection allowed for the use of a manual language between distant participants. In <ref> (Speeter, 1992) </ref>, hand in put from an EXOS dextrous hand master TM controlled a robot hand some distance away from the user. Discussion of the appropriateness of hand input for particular computer applications has been limited, as well.

Reference-contexts: A good discussion of the use of hand gestures to interact with a Virtual Environment is given in <ref> (Sturman, et. al., 1989) </ref>. Often the use of the device is limited to a small set of commands, for which the user trains the computer to recognize a hand posture and/or gesture.
