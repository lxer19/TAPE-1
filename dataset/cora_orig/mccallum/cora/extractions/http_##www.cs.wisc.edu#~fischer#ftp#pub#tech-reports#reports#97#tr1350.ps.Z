Abstract: In this paper, we introduce 2-way quantum finite state automata (2qfa's), which are the quantum analogue of deterministic, nondeterministic and probabilistic 2-way finite state automata (2dfa's, 2nfa's and 2pfa's). We prove the following facts regarding 2qfa's.

Reference-contexts: We also note that the non-context-free language fa m b m c m j m 1g can be recognized by bounded error, polynomial time 2qfa's, based on the same technique. In order to prove 2, we apply a technique from a recent result of Lange, McKenzie and Tapp <ref> [15] </ref> regarding reversible simulation of deterministic Turing machines to the finite automaton case. As a corollary of 2, we have that reversible 2-way finite state automata are equivalent in power to (1-way or 2-way) deterministic finite state automata. <p> In order to prove this fact, we use a technique from a recent result due to Lange, McKenzie and Tapp <ref> [15] </ref> regarding space-efficient reversible simulation of deterministic Turing machines. Here, the construction is considerably simpler than in the Turing machine case, due to the fact that 1dfa's are much simpler than Turing machines.

Reference-contexts: Here, the construction is considerably simpler than in the Turing machine case, due to the fact that 1dfa's are much simpler than Turing machines. A 1dfa can be formally specified by a quintuple A = (S; ; ; s 0 ; F ) in the familiar way (see <ref> [16] </ref>, for example). Given such an A, we define a 2qfa M = (Q; ; ffi; q 0 ; Q acc ; Q rej ) which will accept the same language as A.

Reference-contexts: As a corollary of 2, we have that reversible 2-way finite state automata are equivalent in power to (1-way or 2-way) deterministic finite state automata. This is in contrast to the fact that 1-way reversible finite state automata are known to be less powerful than deterministic finite state automata <ref> [19] </ref>. The remainder of this paper has the following organization. In Section 2, we define 2-way quantum finite state automata, and in Section 3 we provide a well-formedness criterion for 2qfa's and discuss a method by which well-formed 2qfa's can be easily specified.
