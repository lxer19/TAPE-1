Reference-contexts: The maximum packet length of any DVMRP message should be the maximum packet size required to be forwarded without fragmenting. The use of Path MTU Discovery [Mogu90] is encouraged to determine this size. In the absence of Path MTU, the Requirements for Internet Hosts <ref> [Brad89] </ref> specifies this number as 576 octets. Be sure to consider the size of the encapsulated IP header as well when calculating the maximum size of a DVMRP protocol message. 4.

Reference-contexts: A good introduction to distance vector routing can be found in [Perl92]. The application of distance vector routing to multicast tree formulation is described in [Deer91]. 1.1. Reverse Path Multicasting Datagrams follow multicast delivery trees from a source to all members of a multicast group <ref> [Deer89] </ref>, replicating the packet only at necessary branches in the delivery tree. The trees are calculated and updated dynamically to track the membership of individual groups.

Reference: [Fen96a] <author> Fenner, W., </author> <title> "Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 2", </title> <booktitle> Work In Progress, </booktitle> <month> January </month> <year> 1997. </year>
Reference-contexts: The IGMP local group database is maintained by an elected IP multicast router on each physical, multicast capable network. The details of the election procedure are discussed in <ref> [Fen96a] </ref>. If the destination group address is listed in the local group database, and the router is the designated forwarder for the network, then the interface should be included in the list of downstream interfaces. <p> Protocol Header DVMRP packets are encapsulated in IP datagrams, with an IP protocol number of 2 (IGMP) as specified in the Assigned Numbers RFC [Reyn94]. All fields are transmitted in Network Byte Order. DVMRP packets use a common protocol header that specifies the IGMP <ref> [Fen96a] </ref> Packet Type as hexadecimal 0x13 (DVMRP). A diagram of the common protocol header follows: 0 8 16 31 Type (0x13) Code Checksum Minor Major Version Version Reserved A Major Version of 3 and a Minor Version of 0xFF should be used to indicate compliance with this specification. <p> Be sure to consider the size of the encapsulated IP header as well when calculating the maximum size of a DVMRP protocol message. 4. IANA Considerations The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is the central coordinator for the assignment of unique parameter values for Internet protocols. DVMRP uses IGMP <ref> [Fen96a] </ref> IP protocol messages to communicate between routers. The IGMP Type field is hexadecimal 0x13. On IP multicast capable networks, DVMRP uses the All-DVMRP-Routers local multicast group. This group address is 224.0.0.4. 5. Network Management Considerations DVMRP provides several methods for network management monitoring and troubleshooting.
Reference: [Fen96b] <author> Fenner, W., Casner, S., </author> <title> "A "traceroute" facility for IP Multicast", </title> <booktitle> Work In Progress, </booktitle> <month> November </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: They were used to specify the PRUNE, GENID, and MTRACE bits. The first two, PRUNE and GENID, are now required features. The MTRACE bit must be set so existing implementations will not assume this neighbor does not support multicast trace-route <ref> [Fen96b] </ref>. However, since this bit is now reserved and set to 1, newer implementations should not use this bit in the Probe message to determine if multicast trace-route is supported by a neighbor. Instead, the M bit should only be used in a Neighbors2 message as described in Appendix B. <p> Network Management Considerations DVMRP provides several methods for network management monitoring and troubleshooting. Appendix B describes a request/response mechanism to directly query DVMRP neighbor information. In addition, a Management Information Base for DVMRP is defined in [Thal96]. A protocol independent multicast trace route facility is defined in <ref> [Fen96b] </ref>. Pusateri [Page 21] INTERNET-DRAFT DVMRP Version 3 February 1997 6. Security Considerations Security for DVMRP follows the general security architecture provided for the Internet Protocol [Atk95a]. This framework provides for both privacy and authentication. It recommends the use of the IP Authentication Header [Atk95b] to provide trusted neighbor relationships.
Reference: [Full93] <author> Fuller, V., T. Li, J. Yu, and K. Varadhan, </author> <title> "Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): an Address Assignment and Aggregation Strategy", </title> <type> RFC 1519, </type> <month> September </month> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: Implementations may wish to provide a mechanism to aggregate source networks to reduce the size of the unicast routing table. All implementations should be able to accept reports for aggregated source networks in accordance with Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) as described in [Rekh93] and <ref> [Full93] </ref>. There are two places where aggregation is particularly useful. 1. At organizational boundaries to limit the number of source networks advertised out of the organization. 2. Within an organization to summarize non-local routing information by using a default (0/0) route. 3.4.1. <p> This means that the netmask value will always be represented in 3 octets. This method of specifying source network masks is compatible with techniques described in [Rekh93] and <ref> [Full93] </ref> to group traditional Class C networks into super-nets and to allow different subnets of the same Class A network to be discontinuous.
Reference: [Mogu90] <author> Mogul, J., Deering, S., </author> <note> "Path MTU Discovery", RFC 1191, </note> <month> November </month> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: The inner IP header remains unchanged from the original packet. The maximum packet length of any DVMRP message should be the maximum packet size required to be forwarded without fragmenting. The use of Path MTU Discovery <ref> [Mogu90] </ref> is encouraged to determine this size. In the absence of Path MTU, the Requirements for Internet Hosts [Brad89] specifies this number as 576 octets. Be sure to consider the size of the encapsulated IP header as well when calculating the maximum size of a DVMRP protocol message. 4.
Reference: [Perk96] <author> Perkins, C., </author> <title> IP Encapsulation within IP, </title> <booktitle> RFC 2003, </booktitle> <month> October </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: Therefore, all DVMRP protocol messages sent to tunnel endpoint addresses should now be encapsulated in IP protocol 4 packets just as multicast data packets are encapsulated. See Appendix C for backward compatibility issues. More information on encapsulated tunnels can be found in <ref> [Perk96] </ref>. 1.3. Document Overview Section 2 provides an overview of the protocol and the different message types exchanged by DVMRP routers. Those who wish to gain a general understanding of the protocol but are not interested in the more precise details may wish to only read this section.

Reference-contexts: By determining the best path back to a source, a router can know which interface it should expect traffic from that source to arrive on. A good introduction to distance vector routing can be found in <ref> [Perl92] </ref>. The application of distance vector routing to multicast tree formulation is described in [Deer91]. 1.1. Reverse Path Multicasting Datagrams follow multicast delivery trees from a source to all members of a multicast group [Deer89], replicating the packet only at necessary branches in the delivery tree.

Reference-contexts: It covers sending and receiving of DVMRP messages as well as the generation and maintenance of IP Multicast forwarding cache entries. 3.1. Protocol Header DVMRP packets are encapsulated in IP datagrams, with an IP protocol number of 2 (IGMP) as specified in the Assigned Numbers RFC <ref> [Reyn94] </ref>. All fields are transmitted in Network Byte Order. DVMRP packets use a common protocol header that specifies the IGMP [Fen96a] Packet Type as hexadecimal 0x13 (DVMRP).
