Title: Fourier Analysis of the Bandlimited Shape Estimation Problem in Tactile Sensing

Abstract: This paper focuses on static sensing of local contact shape from passive touch through the use of a capacitive array sensor embedded in an elastic medium. Previously we have determined sensor spacing requirements given sensor depth and developed techniques for determining the Fourier coefficients for a pressure distribution given indenter shape [15]. By comparing line load frequency responses for sensors at different depths with the Fourier representations of indenter pressure distributions, we determine the sensor depth at which shape classification and discrimination is possible. The results indicate that our current sensor designs allow shape discrimination within a class but not differentiation between indenter classes.

This technique leads to noise amplification, and assumes the the sampled array is just a low pass filtered version of the normal surface displacement when in fact the sampled data is due to both normal and shear tractions on the surface.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently it has been shown that the human tactile sensory system is capable of fine shape discrimination from static touch <ref> [7] </ref>. Robotic tactile sensors have also been shown to have the capability of providing curvature information [5], however recent results using finite-element models of tactile sensors indicate that shape classification is hard [3]. <p> Recently Goodwin conducted experiments to determine the ability of humans to discriminate spheres of varying radii pressed into human fingerpads at various loads after a period of training <ref> [7] </ref>. It was found that, at a 75 % level, humans could discriminate between a flat surface and a radius of 204 mm, and between a radius of 6.95 mm and 6.17 mm, a difference of 12.5 %.

Reference-contexts: Interestingly enough, this corresponds to a change in diameter of contact area of 0.6 mm. For comparison, humans are able to discriminate between a flat surface and a radius of 550 mm when they are allowed to move their fingers over the surface of the object <ref> [8] </ref>. Perhaps the most important difference between these two studies is training. Static discrimination of curvature improved with training, but haptic discrimination did not require training. We can conclude that the human sensory system has the capability of statically discriminating curvatures.

The intersection of the noise plane with the error surface indicates the boundary of 95 % confidence in classification.
