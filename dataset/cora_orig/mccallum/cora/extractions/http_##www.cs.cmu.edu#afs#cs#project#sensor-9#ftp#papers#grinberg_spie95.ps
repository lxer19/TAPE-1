Abstract: We address the issue of creating imagery on a screen that, when viewed by naked human eyes, will be indistinguishable from the original scene as viewed through a visual accessory. Visual accessories of interest include, for example, binoculars, stereomicroscopes, and binocular periscopes. It is the nature of these magnifying optical devices that the transverse (normal) magnification and longitudinal (depth-wise) magnification are different. That is why an object viewed through magnifying optical devices looks different from the same object viewed with the naked eye from a closer distance the object looks "squashed" (foreshortened) through telescopic instruments and the opposite through microscopic instruments. We rigorously describe the quantitative relationships that must exist when presenting a scene on a screen that stereoscopically simulates viewing through these visual accessories.
