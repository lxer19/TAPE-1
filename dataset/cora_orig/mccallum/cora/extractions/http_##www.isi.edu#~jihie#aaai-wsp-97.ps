Abstract: The exponential growth of the Internet and increasing communication and computational power have created many opportunities for advancing engineering, manufacturing and business activities. Although rich in content, existing catalog systems are poor in both search quality and the usage of the retrieved information. This paper focuses on increasing the quality of search results and providing users with easier access to catalog information. We provide various ways of understanding user requirements and powerful reasoning capabilities, so that the catalog service can correctly capture the user goals and extract all and only useful information in the library in an efficient way.

Reference-contexts: They have traditionally been in paper form and are due for rapid revolution in content and presentation because of the existence of the Internet and the World Wide Web. PartNet <ref> [1] </ref> and IndustryNet [2] are examples. Most of the benefits of catalogs and libraries are based on a major prerequisite: that the information is easily and conveniently accessible to the customer (i.e., it is reachable and usable). This assumption does not naturally hold in general.

Reference-contexts: After an application is built, it can be also be executed on different machines. The semantic network of Active Catalog is modeled in Loom <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, a knowledge representation system language and environment developed at ISI for constructing intelligent applications. The Loom system provides deductive support for the declarative portion of the Loom language. Declarative knowledge in Loom consists of definitions, rules, facts, and default rules.

Reference-contexts: Declarative knowledge in Loom consists of definitions, rules, facts, and default rules. The semantic model of servo control system consists of a set of definitions, rules and facts, matching Loom's power. To support building domain ontology and incremental development of a shared ontology, Active Catalog is using Ontosaurus <ref> [5] </ref>, a web-based ontology editor for Loom. 3 Searching for Catalog Information 3.1 Increasing the hit ratio The hit ratio of retrieved information can be defined as the proportion of the useful items among the retrieved items.

Reference-contexts: The inference rules/constraints used are: (1) high level oxygen environment is explosive; (2) brush incurs spark in the explosive environment and it is not safe; and (3) the power source of brushless motors is electricity. 4 Related Work Ontolingua, the Ontology project at Stanford <ref> [6, 7] </ref> provides a framework for building ontology, and unifying and disseminating models, as Ontosaurus does. The system is a knowledge-base independent language designed for ease of translation between different knowledge base. It is not designed to reason about services, a key in dynamic access to information sources.

Reference-contexts: A number of other researchers are exploring knowledge-based design environments. In particular, SHADE system <ref> [9] </ref> uses an ontology based approach to facilitate collaboration between product development and integrated manufacturing. SHADE is based on Ontolingua while Active Catalog will be based on Ontosaurus. The differences between the two ontology servers apply in the same way to the differences between SHADE and Active Catalog.

Reference-contexts: Also, Active Catalog provides more powerful mechanisms for information search and evaluation by providing various information access processes and simulations of many modalities, in addition to viewing texts and drawings. Mediator <ref> [10] </ref> is a knowledge support system for managing activities in manufacturing process.

Reference-contexts: The databases that store up-to-date the vendor information in the Internet can be wrapped using the architecture services to support semantic queries. Once the satisfactory products are found by Active Catalog, they can be bought. Currently we plan to integrate with FAST <ref> [11] </ref>, an electronic commerce system operating at ISI to implement real purchases. 6 Acknowledgment We wish to thank our former colleague, Ping Luo for his earlier work in Active Catalog. We also would like to thank Ravi Gauba, Houchang Lu and Shivanand Bhajekar for their implementation efforts.
