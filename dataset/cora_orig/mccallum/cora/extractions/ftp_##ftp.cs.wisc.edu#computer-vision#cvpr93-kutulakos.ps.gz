Abstract: We consider the following problem: How should an observer change viewpoint in order to generate a dense image sequence of an arbitrary smooth surface so that it can be incrementally reconstructed using the occluding contour and the epipolar parameterization? We present a collection of qualitative behaviors that, when integrated appropriately, purposefully control viewpoint based on the appearance of the surface in order to provably solve this problem.

Reference-contexts: The behaviors we describe address the following problem: How should the motion of the observer be controlled in order to generate a dense sequence of images that allows global reconstruction of the surface using the occluding contour and the epipo-lar parameterization <ref> [3] </ref>? Our behaviors are developed in the context of three increasingly more general reconstruction tasks: The local reconstruction task, where the observer must control viewpoint to reconstruct a patch around a selected surface point; the incremental reconstruction task, where the observer must control viewpoint to iteratively grow a reconstructed region on <p> This allows the reconstructible points on the surface (i.e., the non-concave surface points that can lie on the visible rim) to be considered as a collection of patches, each of which is a family of visible rim curves <ref> [3] </ref>. Our approach is based on the following three observations.

In <ref> [4] </ref> we show how these behaviors can be used to perform the global reconstruction task. 2 Local Reconstruction by Purposive Motion In our approach, both global and incremental reconstruction is performed by integrating a collection of qualitative viewpoint control behaviors, each of which performs an instance of the following local reconstruction <p> The special sets for which this cannot be achieved bound the reconstructible surface regions <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> We present only two of the four behaviors.
