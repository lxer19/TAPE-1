Abstract: 13.1.1 Learning to Fly Biological flight is the "existence proof" of the ability of flying. Human flight started with analogy of birds. Abstract analogies helped human design parts of the flying machine, such as wings and landing gear of the planes. However, specific analogies didn't help, such as the flapping of the birds' wings and the feathers on their wings. The ear does spectral decomposition. Hearing is roughly log(f) and log(A). Also, the ear has limited frequency resolution(critical bands). The hearing range is 300-3300Hz, 48dB for intelligibility. These analogies are the jumping-off point for most speech signal analysis these are the "wings and landing gear" of speech DSP. A few groups are exploring more detailed analogies. There is ample room for more detailed analogy. We should study physiology and psychoacoustics non-superficially. We should also form theories about the underlying computations. And finally implement theories at the highest level of abstraction possible, but no higher. The last point is a tricky one-too high lands you in airplane abstraction territory, too low then computational issues dominate.
