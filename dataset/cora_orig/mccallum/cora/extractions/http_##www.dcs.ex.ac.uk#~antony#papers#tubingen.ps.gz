Title: Time and Continuity in Philosophy, Mathematics, and Artificial Intelligence

Abstract: Both ancient and medieval philosophers were much exercised by the notion of continuity, in particular the problem of the instant of change. Aristotle held that when an object starts moving, there is neither a last instant at which it is at rest, nor a first instant when it is in motion, since being at rest and being in motion are properties which can hold of an object only over an interval, not at an instant. Modern mathematical analysis provides a different picture, based on instantaneous rates of change. The velocity of an object at an instant is the limit of its average velocity over an interval containing that instant as the length of the interval tends to zero. By the mathematical definition of continuity, when an object starts moving, there is a last moment when it is at rest, but no first moment when it is in motion. The mathematical picture is useful in a wide range of applications, but many philosophers have found it disquieting. C. L. Hamblin suggested that for qualitative discourse we dispense with the notion of an instant altogether, and adopt a model of time in which intervals exist as entities in their own right rather than as aggregates of instants. Hamblin's approach has been duplicated in Artificial Intelligence by J. F. Allen, whose interval-based temporal framework has been widely influential. Allen's main reason for abolishing instants was that if we allow them then we have the problem of deciding whether our intervals are open or closed. I argue that Allen was mistaken both in thinking that we can dispense with instants and in thinking that if we allow them then we have to consider open and closed intervals. A more satisfactory picture is to regard an instant as arising from the division of an interval into two parts which jointly exhaust the interval without either of them containing the instant which separates them. I present a model of time which includes both instants and intervals, without the question of closure arising, and argue that this model is the right one for the kind of qualitative simulation which has become an important desideratum of the Artificial Intelligence enterprise and which is closely related to the kinds of qualitative descriptions which Hamblin was interested in.

Reference-contexts: An obvious simplification of this, avoiding explicit mention of situations, is to say `The property f holds at time t'. And precisely this is the style of locution favoured by the most influential successor to the Situation Calculus, namely Allen's Interval Calculus <ref> (Allen 1981, Allen 1984) </ref>. Like Hamblin, Allen argues that we do not need instants; his arguments are essentially the same, though phrased somewhat differently: If one allows time points, one must consider whether intervals are open or closed.

Reference-contexts: One solution to this problem is to stipulate by convention that intervals are open at the lower end and closed at the upper end, but then every interval has only a single endpoint. The artificiality of this solution reinforces the argument against allowing points. <ref> (Allen 1984, p.128) </ref> 8 Note that this argument assumes that `allowing time points' means adopting the mathematicist view of an interval as a set of points, although all Allen says in support of this assumption is that `a good analogy : : : is that times correspond to intervals on the

Reference-contexts: Like Hamblin (and in contrast to McCarthy and Hayes), Allen opts for intervals as the basic temporal entity, deriving instants as equivalence classes of intervals in a way which, though different from Hamblin's, is ultimately equivalent to it <ref> (Allen & Hayes 1985) </ref>. Like Hamblin, Allen takes abutment as the primitive interval-interval relation, written meets (i; j), and he notes that there are thirteen such relations altogether, which can all be derived from meets.

Reference-contexts: while resting, nor from motion while moving; but this instant, a strange nature, is something inserted between motion and rest, and it is in no time at all; but into it and from it what is moved changes to being at rest, and what is at rest to being moved. <ref> (Allen 1983, p.43) </ref> When something begins to move, there is an initial period over which it is at rest, and therefore has not yet begun to move, followed by a period over which it is in motion, and therefore has already begun to move.

Reference-contexts: The reason why it cannot be instantaneously green, tout court, is that green consists of an extended continuum of different particular shades. In the same way, a moving point may be located instantaneously at a point in space, but it could not be located instantaneously within a region. <ref> (Galton 1984, p.19) </ref> Developing this point further, in a critique of Allen's Interval Calculus, I argued in (Galton 1990) essentially as follows.

Reference-contexts: Like Hamblin, Allen takes abutment as the primitive interval-interval relation, written meets (i; j), and he notes that there are thirteen such relations altogether, which can all be derived from meets. Moreover, the axioms given by Allen lead to a system entirely equivalent to that of Hamblin <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref>. To say that property p holds on interval t, Allen writes `holds (p; t)', and this corresponds to Hamblin's notation `a'. <p> In the same way, a moving point may be located instantaneously at a point in space, but it could not be located instantaneously within a region. (Galton 1984, p.19) Developing this point further, in a critique of Allen's Interval Calculus, I argued in <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref> essentially as follows. Suppose a body B moves uniformly from position P to position R via postion Q over time interval I. Then there must be intervals I 1 and I 2 such that 9 1. B moves from P to Q over interval I 1 2. <p> Any one of these is on all fours with Hamblin's `phenomenal predicates' except with respect to the crucial issue of whether or not it can be true instantaneously. It becomes necessary, therefore, to classify two-valued predicates according to whether or not they possess this particular property. In <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref> I made a first shot at this. <p> Allen's Holds points the way: we distinguish two forms of holding: holding at an instant, and holding on (or over) an interval. This gives us the notations Holds-at and Holds-on introduced in <ref> (Galton 1990) </ref>. Thus given a state s, an interval i, and an instant , we can form atomic propositions Holds-on (s; i) and Holds-at (s; ).

For the full set of perturbation and dominance relations for this example, see <ref> (Galton 1993) </ref>, where the whole theory is presented in some detail. What then does our final theory look like? We shall follow Hamblin in taking intervals as primitive and constructing instants as equivalence classes of abutting pairs of intervals.

Reference-contexts: L. Hamblin discussed the instant of change problem in two papers, <ref> (Hamblin 1969) </ref> and (Hamblin 1971). He begins the former paper with the following formulation of the problem: At 8 a.m. I get in my car and set off for work. At 7:59 a.m., before I started it, my car was at rest; at 8:01 a.m. it is in motion. <p> But, if whenever a thing is not in motion it is at rest, the state of just startingor, of course, the comparable state of just stoppingmust be either a state of motion or a state of rest. Which? <ref> (Hamblin 1969, p.410) </ref> Hamblin does not wish to quarrel with the mathematicist account by which the instantaneous velocity at the moment of starting or stopping is precisely zero; but he contends that this is something quite different from saying that at that moment the object is at rest rather than at <p> If two-valued statements are predicates of time-instants they are essentially discontinuous: they cannot flow smoothly from falsehood to truth, and yet our time-language presents us with a continuum on which to define them. <ref> (Hamblin 1969, p.414) </ref> The solution that Hamblin proposes is to `build a logic in which intervals are the primary time-elements'. They are to be `treated as entities in their own right and not necessarily as sets of instants'. The primitive notion of Hamblin's interval calculus is that of abutment. <p> To Hamblin's argument: The red book on my desk could turn green for half a second or half a century but it could not turn green temporarily and durationlessly at the stroke of twelve, remaining red at all times earlier and later. <ref> (Hamblin 1969, p.414) </ref> my response is [Hamblin] does not seem to notice : : : that the book could instantaneously be a particular shade of green, passing through it on the way from blue to yellow, say.

Reference-contexts: For there is no such thing as the interval current when the assertion is made. Any assertion is made in the middle of no end of current intervals. It is unclear which of them is relevant in evaluating the assertion. <ref> (Tich y 1985, p.264) </ref> The traditional instant-based semantics avoids this difficulty precisely because now is an instant: there is only one `current instant' to consider.
