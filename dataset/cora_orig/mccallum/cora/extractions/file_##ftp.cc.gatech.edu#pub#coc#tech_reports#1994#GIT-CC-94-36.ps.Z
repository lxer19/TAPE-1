Abstract: Video-On-Demand (VOD) systems are typically designed around the provision of a one-to-one connection between a customer and a video server. Such a scheme is not scalable due to bandwidth and video server resource limitations. On the other hand, it is attractive because it can provide an on-demand system and a high degree of interactivity. In this paper we propose the use of multicast communication in a VOD system wherein multiple users may be served simultaneously by a single video stream transmitted by the server. A limited amount of synchronization of customer requests is needed to further enhance the benefits of the multicast operation. Done properly this should not detract from the on-demand nature of the system. We consider how interactive features, giving the illusion of a one-to-one service, can be added to such a system at the expense of added complexity to system operation and set-top box hardware. The performance of our proposed system is investigated through the use of a simulation.

Reference-contexts: The major challenge in providing a VOD service is handling the enormous demands of VHS-quality video in a real-time network, with real-time interaction [3]. Currently, the preferred approach is to offer one channel per customer and service that customer individually <ref> [1] </ref>. The problem with this type of system is that servicing customers individually is inefficient, expensive, and not scalable. Telephone-based companies and cable-based companies have started working together and experimenting with Video-On-Demand service. Most of these tests are geared only to very small groups; sometimes only about 300 people [1]. <p> individually <ref> [1] </ref>.

While available bandwidth has increased significantly in recent years, servicing an average-size customer area of 2000 families would require more bandwidth than we have available today [2].

Earlier work examined some of the issues in using multicast communication as an information delivery mechanism [7, 8].

Reference-contexts: For the cable TV industry, Video-On-Demand (VOD) offers a lucrative multi-billion dollar industry that is virtually untapped.

Reference-contexts: The Network: The functions of the network are to transmit video frames from the Video Server to the customer, and to transmit control messages. The topology choice for next generation cable TV plants seems to be a star-bus configuration <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. The branches of the star network are optical fiber, and extend from the Central Office (CO) to a neighborhood. Inside a neighborhood, the bus network is coaxial cable, and it connects all the customers. A neighborhood can range in size anywhere from 500 to 2500 customers [4]. <p> The branches of the star network are optical fiber, and extend from the Central Office (CO) to a neighborhood. Inside a neighborhood, the bus network is coaxial cable, and it connects all the customers. A neighborhood can range in size anywhere from 500 to 2500 customers <ref> [4] </ref>. Each branch of the star network can be logically separate, because each connection is a different physical cable. Therefore, neighborhoods are physically separate, and can be considered separate when talking about a Video-On-Demand system.
