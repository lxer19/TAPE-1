Abstract: The technique of earth occultation has produced many exciting results from the BATSE data. We examine the possibility of using this technique on the Total Absorption Shower Calorimeter (TASC) of EGRET. The TASC has an effective area of a few 1000 cm 2 and is 8 radiation lengths deep. Spectra from 1-200 MeV are collected every 33 sec and the rate at 4 energies is monitored every 2 sec. The detector is unshielded and uncollimated so the background is large. The statistical error on the background measurements require several days of exposure to detect the Crab at the lowest energies. Longer exposures would be needed due to systematic errors in determining the background. However, the wide field of view (the effective area is nearly 1000 cm 2 even through the back of the spacecraft) could be used to monitor variability and confirm fluxes of sources such as the black hole candidates, Cyg X-1 and GRO J0422+33. The TASC is a 76 cm x 76 cm x 8 radiation lengths NaI(Tl) detector (Thompson, et al. 1992). The effective area for gamma-ray detection is reduced by the spacecraft material that surrounds it, so an EGS Monte Carlo is used with the spacecraft mass model to calculate the effective area vs energy and for different incidence directions. This effective area is over 1000 cm 2 for a large solid angle which even includes through the back of the spacecraft. For comparison, the effective area at 1 MeV of OSSE is 300 cm 2 and of Comptel is 40 cm 2 . However, the TASC is unshielded and uncollimated, so the background is very large. The background rates for different energy ranges are plotted in Figure 1 for a typical time interval of a few hours early in the mission.
