Abstract: Hybrid systems possess continuous dynamics defined within regions of state spaces and discrete transitions among the regions. Many practical control verification and synthesis tasks can be reduced to reach-ability problems for these systems that decide if a particular state-space region is reachable from an initial operating region. In this paper, we present a computational analysis of the face reachability problem for a class of three-dimensional dynamical systems whose state spaces are defined by piecewise constant vector fields and whose trajectories never return to a state-space region once they exit the region. These systems represent a restricted class of control systems whose dynamics results from a juxtaposition of piecewise parameterized vector fields. We had previously developed a computational algorithm for synthesizing the desired dynamics of a system in phase space by piecing together vector fields geometrically. We demonstrate in this paper that the reachability problem for this class of systems is decidable while the computation is provably intractable (i.e., PSPACE-hard). We prove the intractability via a reduction of satisfiability of quantified boolean formulas to this reach-ability problem. This result sheds light on the computational complexity of phase-space based control synthesis methods and extends the work of Asarin, Maler, and Pnueli [2] that proves computational undecidability for three-dimensional constant-derivative systems.

Reference-contexts: Two of the three state dimensions encode the stack state of the automaton, while different regions of state space embody the control state.

Reference-contexts: They found that many reachability question (point, region, and face) can be decided in a finite amount of time. Their proof exploits the fact that no flow lines in two dimensions can intersect. Asarin, Maler, and Pnueli <ref> [2] </ref> restricted the multi-linear system to dynamical systems having piecewise-constant derivatives. In short, their descriptive vocabulary excludes systems with state-space regions containing rotational and non-parallel flows. The 2D reachability question remains decidable under this restriction. <p> complexity analysis of these systems could shed light on the identification of classes of hybrid systems for which state-space algorithms are practical and domain-specific constraints that make these systems tractable. 2 Definitions We define a dynamical system and a piecewise constant derivative system following the definitions of Asarin, et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. Definition 1 Dynamical System. An (autonomous) dynamical system is H = (X; f ) where X is the state-space and f is a partial function from X to X such that d + x = f (x) is the differential equation governing the evolution of x. <p> By definition, the trajectories of a VOPCD system never revisit the same region. This is an important restriction of the PCD system. Eliminating cyclic flows undermines the dual push-down automata construction described by Asarin et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. In fact, point, face, and region reachability are decidable in the context of VOPCD. Consider face reachability (point and region reachability follow similar arguments).

Reference-contexts: Hence, it is important to characterize the computational properties of these reachability algorithms and if they are intractable, identify classes of hybrid systems for which these algorithms are practical. Maler and Pnueli <ref> [11] </ref> examined a class of hybrid systems known as two-dimensional multi-linear systems. They found that many reachability question (point, region, and face) can be decided in a finite amount of time. Their proof exploits the fact that no flow lines in two dimensions can intersect. <p> In fact, the number of regions grows exponentially with i. 3.2 Variable assignment testing Before building clauses, we need to explain how we will test the assignment of a particular variable. One of the limitations of the 2D multi-linear system that Maler and Pnueli <ref> [11] </ref> took advantage of was the inability of two flows to converge and become a single flow (Figure 1). Since the apparatus will combine the outputs of several filters to produce a single flow, another dimension is added to the variable assignment.
