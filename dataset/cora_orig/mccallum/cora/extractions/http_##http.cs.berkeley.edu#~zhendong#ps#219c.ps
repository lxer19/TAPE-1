Title: Stutter-Abstract Temporal Logics  
Author: Zhendong Su

Affiliation: EECS Department University of California,  
Abstract: In this paper, we study the state equivalences related to stuttering and how they relate to various temporal logics without the next-time operator. We first show that stutter closure of bisimilarity is not an abstract semantics for STL U 1 . Then we suggest a new logic STL AU , which is a restricted subset of the logic STL U . We show that stutter closure of bisimilarity is a full abstract semantics for STL AU . Next, we suggest a new state equivalence until-bisimilarity and show that it is a full abstract semantics for STL U . Finally we extend the results to other logics without the next-time operator.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In formal verification, property preserving abstractions are very important for combating the state-space explosion problem. Thus, it is important to study when two states of an observation structure satisfy the same set of properties specifiable by logics <ref> [1] </ref>. A state equivalence ' is a family of relations such that for each observation structure, it induces a equivalence relation on the states of that structure. <p> state equivalences, that is two states are stutter closed X equivalent if they are X equivalent in the stutter closure, where X stands for any state equivalence. fl This is author's project report for EE219C, Computer-Aided Verification, taught by Professor Tom Henzinger in Spring 1998. 1 It was suggested in <ref> [1] </ref> that the stutter closure of bisimilarity is an abstract semantics for STL U . 1 With this notion of stutter closure of state equivalences, it is natural for one to conjecture that the stutter closure of bisimilarity might be a full characterization of state logics without the next operator such <p> Finally we conclude (Section 9). 2 State Equivalences and Their Stutter Closures In this section, we define state equivalences and the stutter closures of them. These definitions are taken from <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Two states s and t of K are bisimilar iff there is a bisimulation of K such that st. Alternatively, bisimilarity can be characterized by the so-called i-step bisimilarity when we view it as games between two players <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 Definition 2 (i-step bisimilarity) The state equivalences i , called i-step bisimilarity for each natural number i, are defined inductively. The state equivalence 0 coincides with observational equivalence; that is, 0 =.
