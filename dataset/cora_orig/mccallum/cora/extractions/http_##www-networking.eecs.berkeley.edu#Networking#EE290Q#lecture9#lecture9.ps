Reference-contexts: Large deviations theory provides the analysis of this hopefully rare event. This naturally leads to the definition of the effective bandwidth of an information source in a statistically multiplexed network. The following is elaborated on in Shwartz <ref> [1] </ref> and in Tse [2]. 2 A Review of a Large Deviations Result Recall that if fX i g is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with expected value , then for &gt; , P ( i=1 where fl fl () = max (r fl (r)); and fl
