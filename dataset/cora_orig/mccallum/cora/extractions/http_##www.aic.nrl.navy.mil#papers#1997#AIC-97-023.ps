Abstract: Conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) is a form of interactive case-based reasoning where users input a partial problem description (in text). The CCBR system responds with a ranked solution display, which lists the solutions of stored cases whose problem descriptions best match the user's, and a ranked question display, which lists the unanswered questions in these cases. Users interact with these displays, either refining their problem description by answering selected questions, or selecting a solution to apply. CCBR systems should support dialogue inferencing; they should infer answers to questions that are implied by the problem description. Otherwise, questions will be listed that the user believes they have already answered. The standard approach to dialogue inferencing allows case library designers to insert rules that define implications between the problem description and unanswered questions. However, this approach imposes substantial knowledge engineering requirements. We introduce an alternative approach whereby an intelligent assistant guides the designer in defining a model of their case library, from which implication rules are derived. We detail this approach, its benefits, and explain how it can be supported through an integration with Parka-DB, a fast relational database system. We will evaluate our approach in the context of our CCBR system, named NaCoDAE. This paper appeared at the 1998 AAAI Spring Symposium on Multimodal Reasoning, and is NCARAI TR AIC-97-023. We introduce an integrated reasoning approach in which a model-based reasoning component performs an important inferencing role in a conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) system named NaCoDAE (Breslow & Aha, 1997) (Figure 1). CCBR is a form of case-based reasoning where users enter text queries describing a problem and the system assists in eliciting refinements of it (Aha & Breslow, 1997). Cases have three components:

Reference-contexts: For many tasks, this model will be more compact than its corresponding rule set, and thus be more comprehensible and easier to maintain.

The object model relates the objects in the domain of the case library. A question model relates the library's questions to the object model. The implication rule generator inputs these models, along with the current problem description, and dynamically creates a knowledge base (KB). <p> Several other examples exist.

We intend to compare the case retrieval performance of our integrated system with one in which users explicitly enter implication rules.

Reference-contexts: However, because an enormous number of text rules could be written, the rule derivation process must be controlled so as to yield text rules whose conditions are abstract. Towards this goal, our approach stores triggering phrases with each hquestion,answeri pair, uses a thesaurus capability (i.e., WordNet <ref> (Miller, 1995) </ref>) and user interaction to identify synonymous phrases, and thereby incorporates text rules into a single "global" rule. Likewise, interactive assistance will is also in volved in identifying and verifying chaining rules derived from the library model. Querying Parka Evaluating Parka-DB queries requires a relational knowledge base. <p> Currently, we have generated implication rules for the printer troubleshooting task and used Parka-DB to derive implied answers from sample user problem descriptions. Our next steps include developing code to link NaCoDAE with Parka-DB, implementing a user interface for domain model capture, and expanding the current integration with WordNet <ref> (Miller, 1995) </ref>. We anticipate that an initial prototype implementation for the integrated environment will be completed by the spring of 1998.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, the user can select and apply a displayed solution. CCBR has achieved tremendous success, especially for solving interactive diagnosis tasks, in commercial, industrial, and government applications <ref> (Watson, 1997) </ref>. Five companies market CCBR shells; the market leader is Inference Corporation. This paper focuses on a specific concern with the CCBR approach: supporting inferencing between user-entered problem descriptions and the case library to ensure that the system's conversations appear to be intelligent.
