Title: Testing CMOS Logic Gates for Realistic Shorts  
Author: Brian Chess Anthony Freitas F. Joel Ferguson Tracy Larrabee 
Address: Santa Cruz  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Engineering University of California,  
Abstract: It is assumed that tests generated using the single stuck-at fault model will implicitly detect the vast majority of fault-causing defects within logic elements. This may not be the case. In this paper we characterize the possible shorts in the combinational cells in a standard cell library. The characterization includes errors on the cell outputs, errors on the cell inputs, and excessive quiescent current. The characterization provides input vectors to stimulate these errors. After characterizing the faults that occur due to possible electrical shorts, we compare the coverage of the logic faults using a single stuck-at test set and tests developed specifically to detect these shorts. We discuss the effectiveness of I DDQ testing for these faults.

Reference-contexts: Likewise, input discrepancies may combine with output discrepancies so that a fault is untestable. A discrepancy on an input wire can affect the detectability of 48% of the WCA in the layouts of the ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits <ref> [BF85] </ref>. Faults representing 15% of the WCA in the commercial layouts of the ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits cannot be tested without justifying discrepancies from the cell's input to a circuit output.

Reference-contexts: Because of discrepancies on the inputs to faulted cells, it is also possible for a short to cause a feedback path external to the faulted cell. This situation is similar to the feedback created by a bridge fault in the interconnect, and can be analyzed similarly <ref> [CL93] </ref>. on a cell input cell alone is not enough to predict the behavior of the cell in the circuit. The function of the short depends of the external logic of the feedback path.

Reference-contexts: Carafe determines which shorts are likely to occur| the realistic shorts|based on the layout (physical design) of the circuit and the types of defects that occur during the chip's fabrication. We use the defect den 1 sities given by Feltham and Maly <ref> [FM91] </ref>. In addition to using the standard version of Carafe on the individual cells, we also use a hierarchal version of Carafe on the entire circuit under test. The hierarchical version is designed to create a gate-level description of the fault-free circuit instead of a transistor level description.

Reference-contexts: 0 0 P 1 1 0 1 1 Table 3: CShort output for DEC1 cell displaying dominant 1 behavior 3.2 CShort Results As Hao and McCluskey observed, a discrepancy on a cell input may occur if the short joins an input and a node that is stronger than the input <ref> [HM91] </ref>. As Table 1 demonstrates, this is the situation when the faulted 4-input and-or-invert gate has inputs 0111. We will discuss the exploitation of cell input error detection in Section 4. <p> In many cases, errors on cell inputs are not observable, but Hao and McCluskey observed that if the the input wire fans out, as it does in Figure 5, the discrepancy may be detectable <ref> [HM91] </ref>. Our investigations have underlined just how important this effect is, and how important repercussions following from the effect are. We will be discussing this in detail throughout the rest of this paper.
