Title: Separators for Sphere-Packings and Nearest Neighbor Graphs  
Author: Gary L. Miller Shang-Hua Teng William Thurston Stephen A. Vavasis 
Date: April 18, 1996  
Abstract: A collection of n balls in d dimensions forms a k-ply system if no point in the space is covered by more than k balls. We show that for every k-ply system , there is a sphere S which intersects at most O balls of and divides the remainder of into two parts: those in the interior and those in the exterior of the sphere S, respectively, so that the larger part contains at most (1 1=(d + 2))n balls. This bound of O(k 1=d n 11=d ) is the best possible in both n and k. We also present a simple randomized algorithm to find such a sphere in O(n) time. Our result implies that every k-nearest neighbor graphs of n points in d dimensions has a separator of size O(k 1=d n 11=d ). In conjunction with a result of Koebe, Andreev and Thurston that every triangulated planar graph is isomorphic to the intersection graph of a disk-packing, our result not only gives a new geometric proof of the planar separator theorem of Lipton and Tarjan, but also generalizes it to higher dimensions. The separator algorithm can be used for point location and geometric divide and conquer in a fixed dimensional space.

Reference-contexts: Building on Lipton and Tarjan's planar separator theorem, Gilbert, Hutchinson, and Tarjan [17] showed that every graph with genus bounded by g has an O ( p gn)-separator. Another generalization was obtained by Alon, Seymour, and Thomas <ref> [1] </ref>, who showed that graphs that exclude minor isomorphic to the h-clique have an O (h 3=2 p n)-separator. Plotkin, Rao, and Smith [36] reduced the dependency on h from h 3=2 to h. Perhaps the oldest separator result is that every tree has a 1-separator (Jordan [21]). <p> Previously, hyperplanes have been used in the recursive coordinate bisection heuristic. Recently, Plotkin, Rao and Smith [36] improved the bounded forbidden minor separator theorem of Alon, Seymour, and Thomas <ref> [1] </ref>. Their work, in conjunction with a structure lemma of Teng [41], gives a combinatorial proof of a much weaker version of the separator theorem for the class of intersection graphs presented in this paper.

Remark 4.6 Eppstein, Miller and Teng <ref> [12] </ref> gave a deterministic linear time algorithm for finding a small cost sphere separator of a k-ply system. Therefore, in theory, all results presented in this section can be made deterministic. However, the randomized construction presented in this section is much faster in practice. More practical deterministic algorithms are desirable. <p> Hence, we can apply separator based divide and conquer to neighborhood systems without knowing its ply k a-priori. 5 Final Remarks and Open Questions Recently, using the duality on S d suggested in <ref> [40, 12] </ref>, Agarwal and Pach [35] and Spielman and Teng [38], independently, gave a much simpler geometric proof that bounds the expected number of balls of a k-ply systems on S d that a random great circle intersects (a la Sections 2.6.2 and 2.6.3 ): Let = (B 1 ; : <p> As shown in <ref> [40, 12, 35, 38] </ref>, it follows from the duality between points and great circles of S d that the expected number of caps of () that a random great circle of S d intersect is equal to c 1 i=1 for a constant c 2 depends only on d.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, each sphere packing is a 1-ply neighborhood system. Therefore, the intersection graph of a sphere packing has an O (n 11=d ) separator that (d + 1)=(d + 2)-splits. Remark 3.5 Koebe, Andreev and Thurston's result strengthens Fary's <ref> [13] </ref> and Tutte's [45, 46] theorem that every planar graph can be embedded in the plane such that each edge is mapped to a straight line segment (see [42, 14]).

The new paradigm also provides a good support for designing efficient parallel algorithms for geometry problems in fixed dimensions (see Frieze, Miller, and Teng <ref> [15] </ref>). 4.1 Point Location The point location problem for a neighborhood system can be defined as: given a neighborhood system = fB 1 ; : : : ; B n g in d-space, preprocess the input to organize it into a search structure so that queries of the form "output all <p> Moreover, in linear time, we can check whether the number of balls a sphere separator intersects is O (k 1fi n fi ).

Geometric Separator Tool-box of Gilbert and Teng <ref> [16] </ref>. The example geometric graph is generated by Eppstein. The neighborhood system of this point set is not explicitly shown in the figure. Each point defines a ball which is the largest ball centered at the point whose interior contains no other points. <p> It is also interesting to determine how our algorithm performs in practice compared to other current algorithms such as the spectral method. This is the subject of current work by Gilbert, Miller and Teng <ref> [16] </ref>. Very recently, using Koebe-embedding and sphere-preserving mapping in a similar way to the work of this paper, Spielman and Teng [39] showed that the spectral method can be used to find edge bisectors of size O ( p n) for k-nearest neighbor graphs and bounded degree planar graphs.

The authors have also jointly written a survey paper [30] that surveys the results from this paper, the companion, and several additional results by various authors on efficient centerpoint computation. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. <p> An example of such a map is stereographic projection. We will use notations that are consistent with our companion paper <ref> [29] </ref>. Let (x) be the stereographic projection mapping from IR d to S d . Geometrically, this map may be defined as follows: Given x 2 IR d , append `0' as the final coordinate yielding x 0 2 IR d+1 . <p> We will prove Theorem 2.2 using the fact that stereographic projection is sphere-preserving, i.e., it maps spheres and hyperplanes (degenerate spheres) of IR d to spheres on S d . A direct proof of this fact is given in <ref> [29] </ref>. We will now give a somewhat indirect proof that stereographic projection preserves spheres. The purpose of this indirect proof is to explain some interesting properties of conformal maps in high dimensions as well as their connections back to two-dimensional conformal maps. <p> Because carries S in IR d to a circle (S) in S d , we define Cost ((S)) = Area (f; S). Let Avg (f ) be the average cost of all great circles of S d . The following theorem has been proven in our companion paper <ref> [29] </ref>. Theorem 2.7 (Continuous Separator) Suppose f is a cost function on IR d . Let be the map from IR d to S d constructed in Lemma 2.6. <p> Then, Avg (f ) = O (Total-Volume (f )) 11=d Remark 2.8 The conformality of the mapping from IR d to S d is necessary in Theorem 2.7 in order to deal with the volume elements in the high-dimensional integrations. We refer the reader to our companion paper <ref> [29] </ref> for a discussion. 2.6.2 Construction of a Cost Function To prove Theorem 2.2, it is sufficient to construct, for each k-ply system = fB 1 ; : : : ; B n g, a continuous function whose total volume is O (k 1=(d1) n) such that each sphere S in <p> Using a simple geometric argument (see the companion paper <ref> [29] </ref>), we can show that for any sphere S in IR d , j O (S)j = O (Area f (S)): (3) The function f i is called the local function of B i . <p> Now, we have (f (p)) d = @ l=1 i2M l 1 d @ l=1 1 d 2 d @ l=1 1 d where m l 6 d k. We now use Inequality 4 below, established in our companion paper <ref> [29] </ref>, to bound the right hand side of the equation above. <p> The class of local graphs is properly contained in the class of overlap graphs defined in our companion paper <ref> [29] </ref> and is much weaker than k-intersection graphs.

In practice, we use an even simpler centerpoint approximation algorithm (see <ref> [16, 30, 6] </ref>). 2.3.2 Conformal Mappings In our separator algorithm and our proof of Theorem 2.2, we map a neighborhood system from IR d to the unit d-sphere S d in IR d+1 .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Motivations of this work are the planar separator theorem of Lipton and Tarjan [26], the geometric characterization of planar graphs of Koebe [23], Andreev and Thurston <ref> [2, 3, 44] </ref>, and geometric divide and conquer. <p> It always splits the graph into pieces of roughly equal size, and we show that with high probability, the separator size satisfies an upper bound that is the best possible bound for this class of graphs that we consider. In conjunction with a result of Koebe, Andreev and Thurston <ref> [23, 2, 3, 44] </ref> that every triangulated planar graph is isomorphic to the intersection graph of a disk-packing, our result not only gives a new geometric proof of the planar separator theorem of Lipton and Tarjan [26], but also generalizes it to higher dimensions. <p> We will only consider simple planar graphs which are graphs that do not have self-loops nor multiple edges between any pair of vertices. We now show that Theorem 2.2 in conjunction with the beautiful Koebe-embedding (Koebe [23], Andreev [2, 3], and Thurston <ref> [44] </ref>) gives a geometric proof of the Lipton and Tarja planar separator theorem. Let a disk-packing be a set of disks D 1 ; : : : ; D n that have disjoint interiors. Notice that every disk-packing is a 1-ply neighborhood system. <p> Notice that every disk-packing is a 1-ply neighborhood system. We call the intersection graph of a disk-packing a disk-packing graph. It is not hard to see that every disk-packing graph is a planar graph. Koebe [23] and Thurston <ref> [44] </ref> (who uses an earlier result by Andreev [2, 3]) showed that in fact every planar graph can be represented as the intersection graph of a disk-packing. We call such a realization a Koebe-embedding of the planar graph.

Reference-contexts: Separators are most useful for designing efficient divide and conquer graph algorithms. The planar separator theorem of Lipton and Tarjan has been used in the solution of planar linear systems [27], in the design of efficient graph algorithms [26], and in VLSI layout <ref> [25, 24, 48] </ref>. Building on Lipton and Tarjan's planar separator theorem, Gilbert, Hutchinson, and Tarjan [17] showed that every graph with genus bounded by g has an O ( p gn)-separator.

Reference-contexts: It follows directly from these proofs that such a centerpoint can be found by Linear Programming on O (n d ) linear inequalities of d variables. Unfortunately, no linear-time algorithm is known for computing centerpoints in higher dimensions. The following sampling algorithm can efficiently compute an approximate centerpoint <ref> [5, 20, 49, 40] </ref>: Algorithm: (Sampling for Approximate Centerpoints) Input:(a point set P IR d ) 1. Select a subset S of P with size l uniformly at random; 2. Compute a centerpoint c S of S, using the Linear Programming algorithm for centerpoints; 3.

Reference-contexts: We call such a realization a Koebe-embedding of the planar graph. For a history of this result, including a comparison of Koebe's result versus the Andreev-Thurston result, see <ref> [52] </ref>. Theorem 3.4 (Koebe-Andreev-Thurston) Every triangulated planar graph G is isomorphic to a disk-packing graph. Because disk-packings are 1-ply systems in two dimensions, it follows from the existence of Koebe-embedding of planar graphs and our sphere separator Theorem 2.2 that every planar graph has an O ( n)-separator that 3=4-splits.
