Reference-contexts: While this mechanism is simple to implement, there are significant security problems associated with remote X sessions, and the communication load placed on the Internet is quite high. The arrival of the HotJava browser <ref> [1] </ref> and of the Java language [4] opens the possibility of embedding interactive applications in HTML documents, which are executed on the user machine after their code has been transferred. Therefore, the main drawbacks of the Java model are code protection and accessibility.

Reference-contexts: Mocha also provides high levels of security and places a light communication load on the Internet. The user interface combines fast responsiveness and user friendliness with the powerful authoring capabilities of hypertext narratives. Models of Algorithm Animation on the Internet Following the event-driven approach advocated by Brown <ref> [2] </ref> and the conceptual framework pioneered by Stasko [7], we view algorithm animation as an event-driven system of communicating fl Research supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant CCR-9423847, by the U.S. Army Research Office under grants 34990-MA-MUR and DAAH04-93-0134, and by the N.A.T.O.-C.N.R.

Reference-contexts: working on the following extensions of Mocha: * Development of new animation services beyond computational geometry, e.g., graph algo rithms, sorting, searching, and parallel computation. * Improvement of the user interface, e.g., the introduction of sound, as in [5]. * Support for 3D animations, specifically for 3D graph drawing (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>). * Extension of the Mocha model to the more general domain of software demonstrations over the WWW.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Algorithm animation helps the end user to understand algorithms by following visually their step-by-step execution, a complex task if relying on the textual program alone. There is a strong educational component associated with algorithm animation that can be used by students individually or in class demonstrations <ref> [6, 8] </ref>. Algorithm animation is also a powerful software tool that can assist the algorithm designer in code debugging and in demonstrating a complex algorithm to a larger audience than merely specialists in the particular area of the algorithm.
