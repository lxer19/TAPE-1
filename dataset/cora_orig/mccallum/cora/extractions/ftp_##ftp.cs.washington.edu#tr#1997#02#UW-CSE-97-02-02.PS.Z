Reference-contexts: Smaller blocks result in lower latency and allow better load balancing when clips are very short. Larger blocks result in higher latency but utilize disks more efficiently, improving throughput. Striping for video servers is discussed in <ref> [BMG + 94] </ref>, [Che94] and [BBD + 96]. Random Striping for News on Demand Servers 3 Replication is a technique for improving latency and throughput. A replicated server stores multiple copies of each video clip in different sets of disks. <p> load is close to the maximum server bandwidth and much larger than the load predicted by the result. 7 Related Work Video servers have received a lot of attention in the last few years and several studies have touched on the performance of round robin striping for video servers ( <ref> [BMG + 94] </ref>, [ORS96], [TDM + 95],[Che94], [CPK95], [BBD + 96]). Several authors have identified and proposed schemes to address high latency in round robin striping.

Reference-contexts: Our result shows that good layouts are plentiful, and once we find one, it will be able to satisfy all sets of requests. Once the layout is chosen, it never changes. Although we can not efficiently verify that our layout is good (this is co-NP hard <ref> [BKV + 81] </ref>), we will know it is not good if a set of requests cannot be assigned to disks without creating a bottleneck. If this happens we can choose another random layout.

Bolosky et al. <ref> [BBD + 96] </ref> describe an implementation of a server using round robin striping and mention that latency in striped servers is analogous to insertion in a open hash table with sequential chaining. <p> Most of these techniques are dynamic, such as replicating popular items to adapt to high demand, moving requests to lightly loaded devices during playback, and caching popular items in memory. Several studies ([Mou96], <ref> [BBD + 96] </ref>) have stated that striping makes video servers more susceptible to disk failures and have considered replication for fault tolerance.

A replicated server stores multiple copies of each video clip in different sets of disks. <p> In a News on Demand server, replication is essential for throughput because clips are so short that striping may not span all disks in the server. Replication in combination with striping is discussed in <ref> [Che94] </ref>. 3 Random Striping Random striping is a scheme that combines replication and striping to randomly lay out video data on disks. In this section we describe this layout and present an algorithm that assigns requests to disks in a way that obeys the bandwidth constraints of each disk.

Reference-contexts: They showed that striping 2 copies of each movie reduced latency but that replication in proportion to movie popularity was essential to almost eliminate latency. Their solution depends on a priori knowledge of an unchanging request distribution. Ghandeharizadeh et al. <ref> [GK95b] </ref> developed an analytical model to estimate the expected startup latency of a request as a function of load and server configuration. They propose replication and request migration to reduce latency.
