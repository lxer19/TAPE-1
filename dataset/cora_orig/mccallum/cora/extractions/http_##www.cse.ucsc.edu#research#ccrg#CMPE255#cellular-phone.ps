Abstract: This paper argues for an internet backbone supporting a cellular base station network. Initially, Internet protocols were not designed for mobility nor were they designed for handling real-time services. Recent research efforts on Mobile-IP and RSVP are aimed at providing these features in the Internet. However, additional support is needed to provide real-time services for moving users. One such real-time service for moving users is the concept of an Internet Cellular

Reference-contexts: Also, how to map the existing cellular services as services that can be provided using the Internet Protocols is an interesting research issue. For example, how to map a cellular conference call to Mobile IP Multicast <ref> [3] </ref>? Providing integrated services in the Internet that includes Cellular service has additional advantages. For example, receiving your e-mail while you are using the Internet Cellular Phone. Recent research efforts in Mobile-IP are aimed at supporting mobility in the Internet.

Reference-contexts: Recently there has been some work in predicting the movements of mobile users in a cellular network. These works rely on the fact that, movements of users have a regular component and a random component. Using these observations, Liu et. al. in <ref> [13] </ref>, have described a predictive mobility management scheme. We believe that, although long-term mobility prediction may be difficult, short-term mobility prediction for the duration of a call can be done using these techniques. * Handoff management: There have been several proposals to reduce the disruption of a connection during handoff.

Reference-contexts: The edge network can be considered to consist of base stations supporting cellular phones or devices that can send and receive packetized voice. The backbone network is an Internet backbone. The base stations are connected to routers that support Mobile-IP routing <ref> [16] </ref> and reservation protocols to guarantee service quality to moving users. The edges supported by base stations with overlapping cells as in existing cellular network is connected to the the internet with the ability to route packets to moving users. <p> disadvantages, it has been found that they can meet the QoS requirements for audio applications to some extent [6, 4, 10]. * Protocol integration: IPv6 [7] provides some unique features; e.g., routing header, destination options header etc., that provide some useful facilities to route data packets to mobile hosts efficiently <ref> [16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The second one is mobility dependent, where the QoS received by a mobile user may vary due to mobility of the hosts. Considering these, a new set of service classes has been defined in <ref> [17] </ref>. To provide mobility independent service to a mobile host, it is necessary to make resource reservation at all cells, over a geographic space, where the host may visit during the call. <p> The reservation along the path over which data is currently flowing is called active reservation and the the reservation along the path over which data is not flowing is called passive reservation <ref> [17] </ref>. Because of passive reservations, the network utilization will be low. To improve the utilization level, we can allow the users of mobility dependent and the best-effort traffic class to use the resources of the passive reservation [17]. <p> along the path over which data is not flowing is called passive reservation <ref> [17] </ref>. Because of passive reservations, the network utilization will be low. To improve the utilization level, we can allow the users of mobility dependent and the best-effort traffic class to use the resources of the passive reservation [17]. However, these users of resources of the passive reservation may suffer degradation of QoS when the actual reservers of those resources arrive into the cell. <p> How much to degrade, how to balance mobile best-effort traffic and mobile guaranteed traffic are open research problems. 4 Issues Based on the above observations, a network system architecture for providing real-time services to mobile users has been proposed in <ref> [17] </ref>. This architecture describes the service classes, admission control schemes, a reservation protocol, MRSVP, which is an extension of RSVP to handle mobile users, and the handoff management schemes. Here we identify the main issues of building an Internet cellular phone system on the framework of the above architecture. <p> Here we identify the main issues of building an Internet cellular phone system on the framework of the above architecture. These are as follows : * Service commitments: Following the architecture described in <ref> [17] </ref>, we propose to provide two types of service commitments, mobility independent and mobility dependent. To obtain mobility independent service, the users need to specify its mobility specification, the set of cells it is likely to visit while the call is in progress. <p> As a result, maintaining network layer connectivity to the mobile hosts by the Mobile-IP protocol has become more efficient. In addition to features already present in RSVP, MRSVP protocol <ref> [17, 18] </ref> requires several additional features; e.g., active and passive reservation, reservation by proxy agents (see [18] for details) to make spatial reservations for the different classes of services to mobile users.
