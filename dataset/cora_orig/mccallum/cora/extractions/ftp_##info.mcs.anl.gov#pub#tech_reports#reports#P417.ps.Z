Abstract: The creation of an automated method for determining 3D protein structure would be invaluable to the field of biology and presents an interesting challenge to computer science. Unfortunately, given the current level of protein knowledge, a completely automated solution method is not yet feasible; therefore, our group has decided to integrate existing databases and theories to create a software system that assists X-ray crystallographers in specifying a particular protein structure. By breaking the problem of determining overall protein structure into small subproblems, we hope to come closer to solving a novel structure by solving each component. By generating necessary information for structure determination, this method provides the first step toward designing a program to determine protein conformation automatically. fl Work supported in part by the Office of Scientific Computing, Department of Energy, under contract W-31-109-Eng-38.

Reference-contexts: The ultimate goal of SWISS-PROT "is to provide a complete annotated protein sequence data bank where all the data is easily retrievable by computer programs and is stored in a format similar to that of the EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database" <ref> [Bairoch 1993a] </ref>. SWISS-PROT is the work of Amos Bairoch. DBEMP currently includes approximately 10,000 articles published in a variety of biological journals encoded into a computer-accessible format.

Reference-contexts: It is worth noting that more than one motif may be indicative of one protein family, allowing multiple checks of family assignment. PROSITE was created by Amos Bairoch <ref> [Bairoch 1993b] </ref>. SWISS-PROT houses translations of sequences contained in the EMBL (European Molecular Biology Laboratory) Nucleotide Sequence Database and all PIR annotated sequence data, as well as original data.

Reference-contexts: To accommodate such "unevolutionary" homologies, PIR assigns sequences that are mostly unrelated evolutionarily to separate superfami-lies, even though they may contain related domains. Margaret Dayhoff initiated the PIR database <ref> [Barker et al. 1991] </ref>. PROSITE contains biologically significant patterns and sites that can be easily used to classify an unknown protein into a known family of proteins. Instead of relying on overall sequence alignment to 3. TOOLS 5 identify structure, PROSITE allows for local sequence alignment matches.

Reference-contexts: TOOLS 6 Although specificity 2 is a prime characteristic of protein interactions, and protein function is intimately tied to protein structure, proteins are actually very tolerant of residue substitutions <ref> [Bowie et al. 1990] </ref>. The detection of structural similarities must therefore look beyond the level of simple sequence homology.

Reference-contexts: The detection of structural similarities must therefore look beyond the level of simple sequence homology. In an attempt to find a new way to look at protein structure, Bowie, Luthy, and Eisenberg <ref> [Bowie et al. 1991] </ref> classified residue microenvironments into 18 environmental classes. 3D protein structure can be converted into a 1D string or sequence of environmental classes. Environmental class sequences can then be aligned to measure the compatibility of a new sequence with the given 3D structure.

Reference-contexts: Also, for a particular structure, an estimated 10 33 different side chain arrangements could create the structure <ref> [Branden and Tooze 1991] </ref>. The search area for determining a protein structure is thus huge, especially if performing a "dumb" search. Note, however, that estimations predict fewer than 1000 topologically different domain structures [Branden and Tooze 1991]. <p> Also, for a particular structure, an estimated 10 33 different side chain arrangements could create the structure <ref> [Branden and Tooze 1991] </ref>. The search area for determining a protein structure is thus huge, especially if performing a "dumb" search. Note, however, that estimations predict fewer than 1000 topologically different domain structures [Branden and Tooze 1991]. Thus, by looking for domains within the 150 amino acid chain, instead of all possible conformations, we reduce the search area by many orders of magnitude. Each time more information on a novel protein is available, this search area is further decreased. <p> It requires enormous amounts of computing time. <ref> [Branden and Tooze 1991] </ref> Therefore, much effort has been directed toward putting DBEMP into a form that is easily accessible by the proposed protein structure assistant. Specifically, this task involves encoding DBEMP's data as Prolog objects and then integrating the database with GenoBase.

Reference-contexts: GenoBase was designed by Ross Overbeek. 3.2 Databases PDB is the largest repository for 3D protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance and contains examples of all known unique protein families <ref> [Hobohm et al. 1992] </ref>. The proteins of known 3D structure, provided by the PDB, are commonly used to check current attempts to automate the process of protein structure determination. A homology match to a protein in the PDB provides invaluable clues to the structure of an unknown protein.

Reference-contexts: The primary difference between our application of Bowie et al.'s method and their original intent is that we include procedures to detect local sequence alignments, as well as global alignments of protein structures. Our approach involves using Miller's sequence alignment program <ref> [Miller 1991] </ref>, which is a "traditional" alignment program based on the PAM matrix paradigm, to detect environmental class homology. Our method is to assign each environmental class, 18 in all, a one-letter code, similar to the idea behind the one-letter amino acid code.

Reference-contexts: Integrating protein data repositories and sequence alignment tools into a single environment is the first step to providing an automated assistant to the crystallographer. 3 Tools GenoBase <ref> [Overbeek and Price 1993] </ref>, an ongoing project at Argonne, is a methodology for integrating biological databases. <p> Users query GenoBase by asking about attributes of data objects and about the connections between objects. Interaction with data repositories may occur by using each independent database directly, through a subset of GenoBase, or through a modified version of GenoBase, to retrieve information pertinent to analyzing protein structures <ref> [Overbeek and Price 1993] </ref>. GenoBase was designed by Ross Overbeek. 3.2 Databases PDB is the largest repository for 3D protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance and contains examples of all known unique protein families [Hobohm et al. 1992].

Reference-contexts: GenoBase provides the unique service of allowing one to access many different repositories at once and relate data from one source to data in another source. Biology has many areas of inquiry, including structure determination, for which simultaneous access of more than one database is needed <ref> [Sillince and Sillince 1991] </ref>. In addition to the features obtainable from the individual databases, the connections between the data sets provide knowledge that can be employed in the search for information relating to protein structure. GenoBase views each data source as a collection of data objects.

Reference-contexts: The PAM values, representing the probability that one amino acid is substituted for another, are the accepted values that have been observed and estimated. They are used as a measure of the rate of evolution, by expressing the number of substitutions (point mutations) per codon per 10 10 years <ref> [Schulz and Schirmer 1990] </ref>. An apparent similarity exists between the design of the homology search itself, whether using the Bowie et al. environmental classes or traditional sequence alignments.

Reference-contexts: Meanwhile, groups such as Bowie, Luthy, and Eisenberg are discovering many general rules and constraints that we can utilize. Other methods for "profiling" a protein by assigning properties of its structure to its sequence exist <ref> [Tcheng and Subramaniam 1993] </ref>. Once the Bowie et al. profiling methods are integrated, we plan to move on to the use of other profiling methods as well.

Reference-contexts: 1. PROTEIN STRUCTURE AND COMPUTER SCIENCE 1 1 Protein Structure and Computer Science The properties of a protein are largely determined by its three-dimensional structure <ref> [Voet and Voet 1990] </ref>. This statement would seem to simplify the process of understanding proteins and their functions. Actually, it exposes the major reason that so little is really understood about specific proteins or even proteins in general. <p> Unfortunately, for many proteins, X-ray crystallographic data is not easy to obtain, and the environment required to produce a clear diffraction pattern may actually deform the native conformation of the protein <ref> [Voet and Voet 1990] </ref>. In addition, given a 2D pattern there are still many possible 3D structures, because of the nondeterministic nature of the 2D to 3D mapping.
