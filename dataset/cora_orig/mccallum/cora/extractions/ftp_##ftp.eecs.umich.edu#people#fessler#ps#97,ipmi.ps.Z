Abstract: PET measurements are usually precorrected for accidental coincidence events by real-time subtraction of the delayed window coincidences. Randoms subtraction compensates in mean for accidental coincidences but destroys the Poisson statistics. We propose and analyze two new approximations to the exact log-likelihood of the precorrected measurements, one based on a "shifted Poisson" model, the other based on saddle-point approximations to the measurement probability mass function (pmf). The methods apply to both emission and transmission tomography; however in this paper we focus on transmission tomography. We compare the new models to conventional data-weighted least squares (WLS) and conventional maximum likelihood (based on the ordinary Poisson (OP) model) using simulations and analytic approximations. The results demonstrate that the proposed methods avoid the systematic bias of the WLS method, and lead to significantly lower variance than the conventional OP method. The saddle-point method provides a more accurate approximation to the exact log-likelihood than the WLS, OP and shifted Poisson alternatives. However, the simpler shifted Poisson method yielded comparable bias-variance performance in the simulations. The new methods offer improved image reconstruction in PET through more realistic statistical modeling, yet with negligible increase in computation over the conventional OP method.

Reference-contexts: We have previously shown empirically that this model better agrees with the exact log-likelihood than either the WLS or OP model [14]. Next we provide an analytical result that corroborates those results. D. Variance Analysis To analyze the variance of each estimator, we apply the analytic approximations suggested in <ref> [2] </ref>. If Y = EfY g, then using a first order Taylor expansion of ^(Y ) results in the following approximation to the covariance of ^ [2] : Covf^g P CovfY g P T (11) IPMI 97 4 where P = [r 20 (; Y )] 1 r 11 (; Y <p> D. Variance Analysis To analyze the variance of each estimator, we apply the analytic approximations suggested in <ref> [2] </ref>. If Y = EfY g, then using a first order Taylor expansion of ^(Y ) results in the following approximation to the covariance of ^ [2] : Covf^g P CovfY g P T (11) IPMI 97 4 where P = [r 20 (; Y )] 1 r 11 (; Y ) and = arg max We apply (11) to find approximate expressions for the variance of the maximum likelihood estimators: ^ OP = arg max L <p> In other words, to achieve the same noise level, the OP method would require about 40% greater scan time. Although the standard deviation values could be decreased by using higher count rates, the ratio of standard deviations of different estimators will remain approximately same for higher count rates <ref> [2] </ref>. We performed additional simulations using the thorax phantom with nonuniform attenuation [14]. The results were comparable. VII. Estimates of the AC rates (^r n ) One needs to know the mean of the AC events (r n ) in order to compute L SP () and L SD ().

Reference-contexts: For regularization, we used the modified quadratic penalty [4], which matches the spatial resolution of different estimators. We generated 100 independent realizations of the transmission measurements. For each measurement realization, an estimate of the attenuation map was reconstructed using 20 iterations of the grouped-coordinate ascent algorithms <ref> [3] </ref> applied to the objective functions (8), (10), (11) and (23). We computed both the sample mean and sample standard deviation images for all methods. Fig. 2 shows horizontal profiles through the sample mean images.

Reference-contexts: However, for the 2D simulations reported here, the SP method performed as well as SD method. Thus the SP method is particularly attractive since it requires comparable computation to OP method but has reduced variance. We plan to compare the SD and SP methods to the uniform Cramer-Rao bounds <ref> [6] </ref>. The high correlation between delayed coincidence events of blank and transmission scans suggest that one can use AC rates estimated from blank scans. We have seen that even using constant AC rates in 2D simulations resulted in only a slight increase in the standard deviation without any systematic bias.
