Abstract: We compare two wireless networking systems designed for mobile hosts, the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF)'s Mobile IP proposal and the DARPA Packet Radio network. We compare the two systems based on performance and scalability metrics. The scenario used to compare the two systems is based in the city of Berkeley, CA, and involves approximately 100 mobile hosts. Simulation results show the Packet Radio network has lower hop counts at the expense of more handoffs. The fixed network structure of Mobile IP makes it less flexible in utilizing network resources in the presence of congestion and failure, but the network resources are used more effectively in normal operation. Per-device bandwidth is less for the Packet Radio network because wireless links are shared among more devices. Packet Radio network performance also degrades sharply in the presence of poor wireless link quality.

Reference-contexts: Users want the benefits of network connectivity while moving from location to location without any loss or interruption of service. Two different designs have been used to tackle this problem. One early system was the DARPA Packet Radio Network <ref> [1] </ref>, which operated as a collection of mobile devices that acted both as end devices and routing nodes.

Reference-contexts: One early system was the DARPA Packet Radio Network [1], which operated as a collection of mobile devices that acted both as end devices and routing nodes. More recently, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has proposed an extension to IP, called Mobile IP <ref> [2] </ref>, which is designed to integrate into existing wired networks and provide mobility to devices via endpoint wireless links. This paper presents a comparison of these two systems, with an emphasis on quantifiable metrics. We construct a sample scenario based in Berkeley, CA. with approximately 100 mobile devices.

Reference-contexts: This ratio could be exceeded, but at a cost of degraded performance. For the first requirement, we assume a minimum of 2 base stations per square kilometer. This assumption was motivated by numbers specified in Metricom's Ricochet mesh network <ref> [3] </ref>, a wireless data network that uses base stations in a similar context. The UC Campus covers approximately 1 square kilometer, and the rest of Berkeley covers approximately 9 square kilometers. For the second requirement, we assume a maximum ratio of 4 mobile devices per base station.
