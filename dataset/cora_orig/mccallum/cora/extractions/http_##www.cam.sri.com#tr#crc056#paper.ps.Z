Abstract: The paper argues the importance of high-quality translation for spoken language translation systems. It describes an architecture suitable for rapid development of high-quality limited-domain translation systems, which has been implemented within an advanced prototype English to French spoken language translator. The focus of the paper is the hybrid transfer model which combines unification-based rules and a set of trainable statistical preferences; roughly, rules encode domain-independent grammatical information and preferences encode domain-dependent distributional information. The preferences are trained from sets of examples produced by the system, which have been annotated by human judges as correct or incorrect. An experiment is described in which the model was tested on a 2000 utterance sample of previously unseen data.

Reference-contexts: The final sub-section briefly summarizes the main features of the French language description. 2.1 Trainable transfer preferences The basic preference model and training method for transfer preferences is the one described in <ref> (Alshawi and Carter, 1994) </ref> and (Rayner et al., 1994a), suitably adapted for the transfer task; a brief summary follows. We start with a training corpus, consisting of a set of utterances, each paired with a list of possible output sentences produced by the transfer component. <p> The target language model score is defined similarly. The first step is to extract a bag of "semantic triples" <ref> (Alshawi and Carter, 1994) </ref> from each possible transferred QLF in the training corpus, following which each individual triple is assigned a discriminant score using the method above. Semantic triples encode grammatical relationships between head-words; we have generalized the original definition from (Alshawi and Carter, 1994) to include relationships involving determiners, since <p> step is to extract a bag of "semantic triples" <ref> (Alshawi and Carter, 1994) </ref> from each possible transferred QLF in the training corpus, following which each individual triple is assigned a discriminant score using the method above. Semantic triples encode grammatical relationships between head-words; we have generalized the original definition from (Alshawi and Carter, 1994) to include relationships involving determiners, since these are important for transfer. <p> Each utterance was analysed using the English language version of the CLE, and for the 1847 sentences where at least one QLF was produced the most plausible QLF was selected using the preference methods described in <ref> (Alshawi and Carter, 1994) </ref>. This was then submitted to the transfer phase, and a set of transfer candidates produced. A simple set of hand-coded transfer preferences was applied, and one French surface string was generated for each of the five highest-scoring transfer candidates.

Reference-contexts: For these reasons, statistically trained machine translation architectures have recently been receiving a great deal of attention. Some researchers (notably those in the IBM CANDIDE project, <ref> (Brown et al., 1990) </ref>) have even gone so far as to claim that statistical techniques are sufficient on their own. Our view is that this is at best unnecessary. <p> We start with a training corpus, consisting of a set of utterances, each paired with a list of possible output sentences produced by the transfer component. A human judge marks each transfer as either acceptable or unacceptable. In line with the noisy-channel statistical model of translation described in <ref> (Brown et al., 1990) </ref>, the plausibility of a new candidate transfer is now defined to be a real number, calculated as a weighted sum of two contributions: the transfer rule score, and the target language model score.

Reference-contexts: This paper will describe work carried out on one such advanced prototype, the Spoken Language Translator (SLT) system (Rayner et al., 1993; Agnas et al., 1994). SLT can translate spoken English utterances from the domain of air travel planning (ATIS; <ref> (Hemphill et al., 1990) </ref>) into spoken Swedish or French, using a vocab ulary of about 1200 stem entries. The Swedish version has been operational since June 1993, and has been publicly demonstrated on numerous occasions.

It covers most important French constructions, including all those occurring frequently in the ATIS domain. The most significant divergences compared to the English language description are in the treatment of clitic pronouns, which will be reported in detail elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: The selected target-language QLF is passed to a second copy of the CLE, loaded with a target-language grammar and lexicon, which generates a surface string using the Semantic Head-Driven algorithm <ref> (Shieber et al., 1990) </ref>. Finally, the target-language string is passed to a speech synthesizer and converted into output speech. Most of this processing has already been covered in detail in (Agnas et al., 1994), with reference to the Swedish version.

Reference-contexts: Next, a set of possible target-language QLFs is created, using the unification-based transfer rules (Alshawi et al., 1991). The target QLFs are stored in a "packed" form <ref> (Tomita, 1986) </ref> to avoid a combinatoric explosion when many transfer choices are nondeterministic. A rule-based post-transfer phase then performs some simple rewriting of the transferred QLFs, following which a second set of trained statistical preferences extract the most plausible transferred QLF and "unpack" it into a normal representation. <p> The negative side is that non-deterministic transfer choices multiply out, giving a combinatoric explosion in the number of possible transferred QLFs. To alleviate this problem, transferred QLFs are packed, in the sense of <ref> (Tomita, 1986) </ref>; lexical transfer ambiguity is left "unexpanded", as a locally ambiguous structure in the target QLF. It is possible to compute preference scores efficiently on the packed QLFs, and only unpack the highest-scoring candidates; this keeps the transfer phase acceptably efficient even when several thousand transferred QLFs are produced.
