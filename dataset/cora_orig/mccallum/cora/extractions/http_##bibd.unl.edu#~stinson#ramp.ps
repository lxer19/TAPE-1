We briefly outline the construction as follows. 1. Let q be a prime power, q b + r c 1. The TA constructs a Fiat-Naor key predistribution scheme (see <ref> [3] </ref>) with respect to every block B 2 B. Thus, for each B, the TA chooses jBj + 1 secret values, denoted u B and u B;x (x 2 B). These are all elements of GF (q). <p> The k B 's have the property that an individual user i can compute k B if and only if i 2 P " B, and any two or more users in B can compute k B (see <ref> [3] </ref>). 4. For every B 2 B, the key k B is used to encrypt s B , as follows: b B = s B + k B ; where addition is performed in GF (q). 5.

Reference-contexts: When c = r 1, the ramp scheme is a threshold scheme. It is straightforward to construct a ramp scheme from an orthogonal array. We present the construction from <ref> [4] </ref>. Suppose A = (a i;j ) is an OA (r; b + r c; q) which is public knowledge. The secret information is K 2 (GF (q)) rc . <p> Thus we have a (c; r; b)-ramp scheme. The following result is an immediate consequence of this construction and Lemma 1.1. 2 Theorem 1.2 <ref> [4] </ref> Suppose 0 &lt; c &lt; r &lt; b, and suppose that q is a prime power such that q b + r c 1.

Let w be an integer such that 1 w n. <p> However, a disjoint forbidden set of size at most w 1 can only decrypt an unauthorized set of shares. We will use a certain type of set system, which was defined in <ref> [6] </ref> as follows. An (n; b; r; )-design is a pair (X; B) which satisfies the following properties: 1. X is a set of points with jXj = n; 2. <p> An (n; b; r; )-design is called a w-threshold design provided that, for all F X such that jF j w, we have: jfB 2 B : jF " Bj 2gj r 1: Now we state our main result, which is similar to <ref> [6, Theorem 4.2] </ref>, the main difference being that the threshold scheme is replaced by a ramp scheme. The resulting information rates are increased by a factor of r c. Theorem 2.1 Suppose (X; B) is a (n; b; r; )-design which is w-threshold. <p> When c = r 1, Theorem 2.1 reduces to <ref> [6, Theorem 4.2] </ref>. However, in many applications it is the case that c &lt; r 1, so our construction often allows improved information rates. 3 2. The value c computed above satisfies the following inequality: c w !
