Reference-contexts: In the more general variable bit-rate (VBR) case, such an adaptation layer cannot be used. An alternative is Adaptation Layer 5 (AAL5) which was initially proposed to carry data traffic over ATM networks. Two distinct approaches have been proposed for encapsulation of MPEG-2 streams in AAL5 packets <ref> [1] </ref>. In the first approach (PCR-aware), the packetization is done ensuring that when a packet contains a PCR value it will be the last packet encapsulated. This reduces the jitter experienced 3 by PCR values during packetization. <p> The reason is that in the VBR case, the packetization jitter will vary as a function of the instantaneous bit-rate. The largest jitter will be determined by the lowest bit-rate employed in the VBR encoding which will not be known to the decoder a priori. In a recent study <ref> [1] </ref>, an alternative packing scheme was proposed which is an enhancement of the PCR-unaware scheme. The scheme has all the advantages of the PCR-aware scheme without its disadvantages. There are three key ideas in this scheme: 1.

Reference-contexts: These applications are not usually sensitive to delay and jitter. Many different service classes have been defined by the ATM Forum to meet the requirements of various applications <ref> [2] </ref>. The real-time services (Constant Bit-Rate (CBR), Real-Time Variable Bit-Rate (RT-VBR)) need specific Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees from the network since they carry traffic with a fixed timing relationship between samples. These service classes provide guarantees on both delay and jitter.

Reference-contexts: The maximum short-term frequency variation for a NTSC signal is 56 Hz within a line (or 34 1 ns/64 s) whereas the corresponding value for a PAL signal is 69 Hz. This corresponds to a variation of the color frequency of 16 ppm/line in both cases <ref> [3] </ref>. If this requirement is satisfied, we can get a correct color representation for each line. The maximum long-term frequency variation (clock drift) that the composite NTSC or PAL signal must meet is 0.1 Hz/sec. <p> the composite signal is to be displayed immediately, the requirements can be relaxed Standard NTSC PAL (M) PAL (B, D, G, H, N) Frequency (Hz) 35795454 3575611.49 4433618.75 Tolerance (Hz) 10 10 5 Tolerance (ppm) 3 3 1 Table 3.2: Specifications for the color sub-carrier of different video formats (from <ref> [3] </ref>). 35 Service Nominal Delay Bit-Rate Two-way Communication Videophone 64 kbps - 2 Mbps CBR (H.261) 200-500 ms Videophone 2 Mbps VBR (H.262) 150 ms (one way) Videoconference 5 Mbps VBR (H.262) 150 ms (one way) VIDEO-Distribution HDTV Distribution 20-80 Mbps VBR 1 sec MPEG-1 core 1.5 Mbps CBR 1 sec <p> All the LPFs considered were Butterworth LPFs with different orders and cutoff frequencies.

Thus, different cutoff frequencies around 0.1 Hz were considered in the LPF selection process. <p> This quantization process introduces a small error which, however, does not affect the convergence time and the steady-state behavior <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> This suggests that not only the maximum jitter has to be minimized by the scheduler but also the autocorrelation of the jitter.

Reference-contexts: Instead of using the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) for measuring the video quality, as is being done extensively in the literature, a new metric is introduced based on a multi-channel model of human spatio-temporal vision that has been parameterized for video coding applications by psychophysical experiments. In <ref> [4] </ref> an experiment was done to investigate the trade-off between acceptability, frame rate and other parameters of a video sequence using several humans to judge and quantify the perceived quality.

Reference-contexts: This is the concern of the science of colorimetry. In 1931, the Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) adopted standard curves for a hypothetical Standard Observer. These curves specify how an SPD can be transformed into a set of three numbers that specifies a color <ref> [9] </ref>. 8 The CIE system is immediately and almost universally applicable to self-luminous sources and displays. However, the colors produced by reflective systems such as photography, printing or paint are a function not only of the colorants but also of the SPD of the ambient illumination.

Reference-contexts: These include the choice of the adaptation layer, method of encapsulation of MPEG-2 packets in AAL packets, choice of scheduling algorithms in the ATM network for control of delay and jitter, and the design of the decoder. The choice of adaptation layer involves a number of tradeoffs <ref> [16] </ref>. Use of a circuit-emulation type of adaptation layer (AAL1) would eliminate the various synchronization problems associated with MPEG-2 but can be used only with constant bit-rate MPEG-2 Transport Streams. In the more general variable bit-rate (VBR) case, such an adaptation layer cannot be used.

Reference-contexts: The quality at the receiver depends on the current congestion level in the network. This is the case with currently available tools for transporting video over the Internet <ref> [21, 41, 50] </ref>. In selecting a specific type of service for video transport, a compromise must be made between two conflicting requirements: quality-of-service guarantees and network utilization. Deterministic CBR is certainly the preferred choice for CBR MPEG-2 Transport Streams.

Frame-based Fair Queueing [68] has both the delay bound of WFQ and bounded fairness.

Reference-contexts: AAL2 will provide support for clock synchronization and superior error control. Different proposals have been made for selecting the type of service under which MPEG-2 is to be transported over ATM <ref> [27, 36, 47, 76] </ref>. For constant bit-rate MPEG-2 streams, the CBR class of service is the natural choice. Even in this case, the scheduling algorithm employed by the switches may influence the overall quality significantly. For the variable bit-rate case, three main approaches have been proposed. <p> Even in this case, the scheduling algorithm employed by the switches may influence the overall quality significantly. For the variable bit-rate case, three main approaches have been proposed. The statistical service with rate renegotiation tries to maximize the multiplexing gain by capturing the VBR nature of MPEG-2 <ref> [27, 76] </ref>. According to this approach, the effective bandwidth of the source during a specific interval is used in order to allocate resources in the network. If enough resources are not available the quality gets degraded and in that sense, the service is statistical. <p> If only limited buffering is available, losses will lead to quality degradation. Statistical Service with Rate Renegotiation: Two recent schemes have been proposed in the literature that deal with this approach. Renegotiated CBR (RCBR) <ref> [27] </ref> is an attempt to combine the simplicity of CBR in terms of bandwidth allocation and call admission control with the advantages of VBR in terms of multiplexing gain. However, the multiplexing gain is not achieved inside the network due to buffer sharing but at the source.

Reference-contexts: The problem that arises in this case is related to the jitter imposed by the network. However, methods of dealing with this problem have been presented in terms of smoothing this jitter via additional buffering (dejittering buffer <ref> [28] </ref>). In the case of Transport Streams, and if we assume that the stream is CBR, this can be done by buffering the incoming bit-stream and by emptying this buffer at constant rate (the Transport Stream rate), in such a way that the buffer does not overflow or underflow.

Reference-contexts: As stated in Chapter 2, MPEG2 Transport Stream has a piecewise constant bit-rate that can be used in order to select the renegotiation points. In <ref> [29] </ref>, a new scheme is proposed to propagate changes in transport rate to the decoder end so that the decoder will be able to filter the cell delay variation (CDV) by knowing the actual rate. <p> One solution is to use a dejittering mechanism that will absorb any jitter imposed by the network. A method for doing that, in the case of CBR MPEG-2 Transport Streams, has been proposed in <ref> [29] </ref> that uses an adaptive prefiltering technique to empty the dejittering buffer. However, in any case the network has to be able to guarantee a specific worst-case delay and bound the overall jitter.

MPEG-2 over ATM The MPEG-2 standard <ref> [31] </ref> does not specify how an MPEG-2 Transport Stream is transported over a communication network. However, the timing model presented in Chapter 2 assumes a constant end-to-end delay from the encoder to the decoder end. <p> The design of the VCO takes into account the maximum difference in ticks of a 27 MHz clock when the jitter is at its maximum allowed value. Since, according to MPEG-2 standard <ref> [31] </ref>, the maximum jitter expected is around 1 ms, this difference is around 30000 ticks. For this maximum difference, the STC frequency must operate within the limits defined by the standard (Eq. (2.1)).

Reference-contexts: AAL2 will provide support for clock synchronization and superior error control. Different proposals have been made for selecting the type of service under which MPEG-2 is to be transported over ATM <ref> [27, 36, 47, 76] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, for some applications |HDTV or MPEG-2 post production| that can have real-time, multi-location news programs, a delay of less than 250 ms is required. 36 There is a misconception that all the video services must be given quality guarantees from the network in terms of strictly small delay bounds <ref> [37] </ref>. However, if the service is one-way, then there is flexibility on the limit for the end-to-end delay. <p> If the service is bidirectional then there is little impact if the delay is less than 150 ms, but serious degradation in quality can occur if the delay is more than 400 ms <ref> [37] </ref>. There is also a synchronization problem (stated as skew in [54] or lip-sync in others) between the video and the associated audio stream. <p> If video and audio denote the displacement from the start of the corresponding stream (video or audio) so that the two streams are perfectly synchronized, i.e., the video unit at video is synchronized with the audio at audio , then the following must hold <ref> [37] </ref>: p ( audio ) p ( video ) 20 ms p ( video ) p ( audio ) 100 ms; (3.1) where p ( audio ) and p ( video ) denote the presentation times of the audio and video units, respectively. <p> In a networking environment, the factors that have greatest impact on quality are the actual packet delays, the number of lost cells (or packets), the number of pixels in an impaired region and its shape, and the locality of the losses <ref> [37] </ref>. Random losses were found to give greater quality degradation than correlated losses for the same loss rate. Even then, the visibility of the loss can be reduced by signal processing means (error concealment techniques) and forward error correction.

Reference-contexts: The RED-VBR scheme [76] attempts to eliminate 57 the overload situations in a similar way by using renegotiation points.

In a recent study <ref> [61] </ref>, Perkins and Skelly showed that with only a small amount of buffering (around 50 Kbytes), the PLL needed at the MPEG-2 decoder end is still able to recover the source clock under the assumption that the jitter introduced by the network is at most 1 ms.

Reference-contexts: In any case, the selection of a scheduling discipline for the ATM network is extremely critical and will have to ensure bounded and low jitter. In addition, synchronization in distributed playback environments must be imposed using special feedback algorithms as noted in <ref> [62] </ref>. In those cases, clock information from the corresponding decoders is fed back to the source which then may take appropriate action to ensure that all the decoders are very close to each other. 60 6.

The delay given above includes all the delays from camera to display (encoder/decoder processing delays, propagation delay etc.). <p> The requirements in error rate for audiovisual services are not well understood.

The values in the table are calculated under the assumption that cell losses are isolated. It was also assumed that one cell loss always causes picture degradation. Of course, in many cases these requirements can be relaxed significantly.

Frame-based schedulers divide time into "frames". A frame, which may be of fixed or variable length, is a time interval in which the various traffic sources make their bandwidth reservations. Examples of such schedulers include Stop-and-Go Queueing [24], Weighted Round-Robin [38] and Deficit Round-Robin [66]. <p> Self-clocked Fair Queueing (SCFQ) [25] avoids the fairness problem of VirtualClock, but its worst-case delay bound is of the order of the number of active connections. Frame-based Fair Queueing <ref> [68] </ref> has both the delay bound of WFQ and bounded fairness. The algorithm is similar to VirtualClock but uses a mechanism to recalibrate the system periodically so that the scheduler remains fair. <p> The schedulers that belong to that class are called Shaped Rate-Proportional Servers (SRPS) and are based on combining a shaping mechanism with a scheduler from the class of Rate-Proportional Servers <ref> [68] </ref>. The basic idea is shown in Figure 4.2. The arriving packets enter a shaper and are admitted into the scheduler when they become eligible.

Reference-contexts: FIFO scheduling discipline, although the simplest to implement, does not provide any isolation among the various flows and therefore cannot offer deterministic bandwidth guarantees. Many algorithms 2 that provide bandwidth guarantees to individual sessions are known in the literature <ref> [10, 24, 25, 38, 59, 66, 68, 69, 70, 77] </ref>. Many of these algorithms are also capable of providing deterministic delay guarantees when the burstiness of the session traffic is bounded (as in the case of the output of a leaky-bucket shaper). <p> In <ref> [69] </ref>, Stiliadis and Varma developed a model to characterize the properties of different schedulers. Schedulers that fall into this classification are called Latency-Rate (LR) servers. The worst-case delay bounds and fairness properties of LR schedulers are shown in Table 4.4. All the schedulers shown in Table 4.4 are work-conserving.

Thus, the service fairness index (SFI) <ref> [70] </ref> can be given by the following equation: SFI = fi fi W i (t 1 ; t 2 ) j fi fi ; (4.2) where W i (t 1 ; t 2 ) and W j (t 1 ; t 2 ) denote the service received by connections i and <p> Frame-based Fair Queueing [68] has both the delay bound of WFQ and bounded fairness. The algorithm is similar to VirtualClock but uses a mechanism to recalibrate the system periodically so that the scheduler remains fair. In a recent study, Stiliadis and Varma <ref> [70] </ref> address the problem of reshaping the traffic at each switch to minimize the burstiness of the sources and the buffering needed inside the network.

Reference-contexts: Both approaches result in quality degradation. However, the degradation is different in those two cases. Several methods for the computation of this constant rate to be allocated in the network or the effective bandwidth -term used in many references- can be found in the literature <ref> [8, 17, 18, 19, 20, 40, 44, 45, 52, 72] </ref>. Deterministic CBR without smoothing at the source: In this approach the effective bandwidth is calculated in the same way as in the previous approach, and is used by the network to allocate resources.

Reference-contexts: In addition, audio coding was added and the scope of the targeted applications was extended to cover almost all applications, from multimedia systems to Video-on-Demand. The activities of JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) <ref> [33, 75] </ref> played an important role in the definition of MPEG. Although JPEG was intended for still-image compression, it can be also applied for moving pictures, considering the fact that a video sequence is nothing more than a sequence of still images.

Reference-contexts: AAL2 will provide support for clock synchronization and superior error control. Different proposals have been made for selecting the type of service under which MPEG-2 is to be transported over ATM <ref> [27, 36, 47, 76] </ref>. For constant bit-rate MPEG-2 streams, the CBR class of service is the natural choice. Even in this case, the scheduling algorithm employed by the switches may influence the overall quality significantly. For the variable bit-rate case, three main approaches have been proposed. <p> Even in this case, the scheduling algorithm employed by the switches may influence the overall quality significantly. For the variable bit-rate case, three main approaches have been proposed. The statistical service with rate renegotiation tries to maximize the multiplexing gain by capturing the VBR nature of MPEG-2 <ref> [27, 76] </ref>. According to this approach, the effective bandwidth of the source during a specific interval is used in order to allocate resources in the network. If enough resources are not available the quality gets degraded and in that sense, the service is statistical. <p> A source under RCBR scheme renegotiates its rate over long time scales using signaling. Between renegotiation points, the rate is assumed to be CBR and equal to an effective bandwidth value that applies during that time interval. The RED-VBR scheme <ref> [76] </ref> attempts to eliminate 57 the overload situations in a similar way by using renegotiation points.

VirtualClock <ref> [77] </ref> has the same delay bounds but is an unfair algorithm because a session may be denied service for an arbitrary time period because of excess bandwidth received in the past.
