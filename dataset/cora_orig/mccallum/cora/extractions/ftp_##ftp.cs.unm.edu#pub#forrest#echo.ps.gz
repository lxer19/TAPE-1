Abstract: Complex adaptive systems (CAS) consist of many interacting and adapting components. Echo is a computational CAS model in which evolving agents are situated in a resource-limited environment. Different views of the notion of species within Echo are compared to biological experiments on relative species abundance, specifically to Pre-ston's "canonical" lognormal distribution.

Reference-contexts: One source of difficulty arises from nonlinear interactions among system components. Nonlinearities can lead to unanticipated emergent behaviors, a phenomenon that has been well documented and studied in physical, chemical, biological, and social systems as well as in some forms of computation <ref> [1] </ref>. Nonlinear systems with interesting emergent behavior are often referred to as complex systems. A second form of complexity arises when the primitive components of the system can change their specification, or evolve, over time. Systems with this additional property are sometimes called complex adaptive systems.

Reference-contexts: Because CAS models tend to strip away many details, it is often impossible to say what any component of one of these models corresponds to in the real world. Continuing with the immune system example, many theoretical immunologists use string matching to model receptor/ligand binding <ref> [2] </ref>. Patterns of bits (or other symbols) are used to represent both molecular shape and electrostatic charge. Consequently, it is difficult to say what one bit in the model corresponds to in the immune system.

Reference-contexts: Since different alphabets and different matching rules can have very different properties, the challenge is to select an alphabet and matching rule that has general properties similar to the real system without worrying too much what each bit really stands for <ref> [3] </ref>. Most theories of modeling are based on the premise that a correspondence can be established between the modeled system and the primitive components of its model. As a consequence of this mapping problem, it is not always clear what scientific questions are being addressed by CAS models.

Reference-contexts: Evolution thus occurs orders of magnitude more quickly than in natural systems, and as a result, we may lose some of the richness of the natural evolutionary process. We have studied several different CAS models over the past fifteen years. Genetic algorithms <ref> [4] </ref> focus on the evolutionary component of CAS. They are reasonably well understood and mature, but ignore several important features, including resource allocation, heterogeneity, and endogenous fitness. Classifier systems [5, 6] apply genetic algorithms to a cognitive modeling framework. <p> This is perhaps the most important contribution that models like Echo can make. The original idea of Echo, including motivation, design decisions, and overall structure were introduced in <ref> [4, 7] </ref>. Our goal in this paper is to describe more fully one specific Echo model (Echo really refers to a class of models) and to show how one might study the extent to which Echo does or does not capture important properties of ecological systems. <p> This paper refers briefly to the elements of worlds and sites. A full description of these elements can be found in any of <ref> [12, 4, 7] </ref>. Section 2.3 describes the structure and properties of agents. 2.2. The Echo Cycle The sequence of events in an Echo cycle consists of the following: 1. Interactions between agents are performed at each site. These include trade, mating, and combat. <p> This has obvious parallels in real-world systems (e.g., in food webs). The importance of this kind of relationship among agents in CAS has often been stressed <ref> [4, 13] </ref>. The six tag and condition genes possessed by every agent are the offense tag, defense tag, mating tag, combat condition, trade condition and mating condition. <p> The use of these genes is described below. It should be noted that the current implementation conforms to a very large extent with the description given in <ref> [4] </ref>, but not with that in [7]. The r genes correspond to the agent's uptake mask, which determines its ability to collect each resource type directly from the environment. <p> Such an agent finds all other agents desirable (including copies of itself). To prevent this, an agent with a zero length mating condition will only find an agent with a zero length mating tag acceptable. This is a slight departure from the description of mating given in <ref> [4] </ref>. Figure 3 shows a simplified view of the two-way matching process used to determine whether mating will occur. When sexual reproduction does occur, a form of two-point crossover is employed. This is complicated by the fact that agent genomes are variable length.

Reference-contexts: What can we hope to learn with a model that by design does not correspond to any real system? We can study patterns of behavior, e.g., how resources flow through different kinds of ecologies, how cooperation among agents can arise through evolution, and arms races <ref> [7] </ref>. We can also use such a model to identify parameters or collections or parameters that are critical, i.e., to perform sensitivity analysis. As with any simulation tool, it is much easier to run hypothetical what-if experiments than to conduct experiments on a real system. <p> This is perhaps the most important contribution that models like Echo can make.

The r genes correspond to the agent's uptake mask, which determines its ability to collect each resource type directly from the environment. <p> When combat occurs, one agent is always killed, and its resources are given to the survivor. In a more recent version of Echo <ref> [7] </ref>, the interaction need not be so extreme and results in a transfer of resources (possibly in both directions, and possibly in a very uneven fashion) between the agents. When two agents encounter each other, the system first checks to see if either would attack the other.

Reference-contexts: All of the entities and interactions in Echo are highly abstract, and it is not yet known whether Echo can be used to model real-world phenomena effectively. Many CAS can be viewed as ecologies (e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>), but our focus in this paper is on the analogy with natural ecologies. Echo resembles some other CAS models. These include Swarm [9], Sugarscape [10], and the Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL) model [11].

Reference-contexts: Each site may contain an arbitrary number of agents, including zero. Each world specifies certain system-wide parameters, including the number of sites, the number of resource types, the taxation rate, parameters controlling replication, and the probability of random death. See <ref> [12] </ref> for details of these parameters. Each site specifies its own mutation, crossover, and random death probabilities, as well as some parameters controlling the details of how resources are managed at the site (e.g., the maximum amount of a resource that can accumulate at the site). <p> This paper refers briefly to the elements of worlds and sites. A full description of these elements can be found in any of <ref> [12, 4, 7] </ref>. Section 2.3 describes the structure and properties of agents. 2.2. The Echo Cycle The sequence of events in an Echo cycle consists of the following: 1. Interactions between agents are performed at each site. These include trade, mating, and combat. <p> The parameter settings that have been held constant throughout the experiments reported in this section are summarized in Table 1. Details on the precise meaning of these parameters are provided in <ref> [12] </ref>. These effects were also observed in earlier versions of the program in which several properties of the model were slightly different. In fact, Echo agents at one point managed to find and exploit a hole (bug) in the function that calculated the points agents receive in combat. <p> Those above the line are the worldwide parameters. These parameters are described in <ref> [12] </ref>. world. Nevertheless these agents and those that found ways to survive, produced graphs of ranked genome abundance that were similar to those of the corrected program. All of this suggests that species abundance patterns in Echo are very robust.
