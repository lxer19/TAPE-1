Abstract: Two algorithmic results are presented that are pertinent to the matching of patterns of interest in macromolecular sequences. The first result is an output sensitive algorithm for approximately matching network expressions, i.e., regular expressions without Kleene closure. This result generalizes the O (kn ) expected-time algorithm of Ukkonen for approximately matching keywords [Ukk85]. The second result concerns the problem of matching a pattern that is a network expression whose elements are approximate matches to network expressions interspersed with specifiable distance ranges. For this class of patterns, it is shown how to determine a backtracking procedure whose order of evaluation is optimal in the sense that its expected time is minimal over all such procedures. Key words: Approximate Match, Backtracking, Network Expression, Proximity Search

Reference-contexts: If it is desired, one can also deliver for each motif, an alignment between one of its sequences and the substring of A it matches that realizes the score of the optimal match using a linear space algorithm like the one presented in <ref> [MyM89] </ref>. To conclude consider the worst-case time complexity for reporting matches in the case that a match does occur in a given region. In regions that are essentially random with respect to the pattern, the expected amount of time taken is described by the calculation of Section 3.1.
