Abstract: In this paper we present a method for generating French texts conveying temporal information. This method integrates the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) and the Systemic Grammar Theory. First, we show how the DRT is used to represent temporal information. We then show how this formalism is used to represent the temporal localization expressed by temporal adverbial phrases. Finally, we give a description of how this representation of adverbial phrases can be translated into a syntactic form, using Systemic Grammar Theory. Pretexte, our implementation of this method, is able to generate a great variety of temporal adverbial phrases.

Reference-contexts: We have considered the other possibilities, that is to take the point or the interval as primitive, but found them less interesting for natural language applications. In particular, <ref> [1] </ref> proposes a system for temporal reasoning, which uses a set of all possible relations that can exist between two intervals. But we believe it is not well suited for natural language generation.

Reference-contexts: We thus focus on the surface generation process, more specifically on the problem of generating the great variety of syntactic markers, such as adverbial phrases and verb tenese. To achieve this we started from the work of <ref> [3] </ref>. She proposes a method to extract the temporal structure of a text, according to the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) proposed by Kamp in [9]. Her work relies on an analysis of temporal adverbial phrases made by Molines [17]. <p> But we depart from Nigel on many aspects, especially on the way of representing the production of verb tenses and adverbs. Pretexte, the system we developed in Prolog, has many resources for the expression of time. The French discourse (D1), which is an adaptation of an example taken from <ref> [3] </ref>, has been produced by Pretexte (an English translation is given on the right). Hier l'avion a effectue un vol (o 1 ). A 8h10 il a quitte Paris (o 2 ). Quand il a survole Barcelone (o 3 ), le reacteur fonctionnait (o 4 ). <p> The four other features in a structure S i give the value of four temporal markers which express the localization of the occurrence. These markers correspond essentially to the four markers proposed by Kamp and Rohrer (as presented in <ref> [3] </ref>) for the analysis of texts, which we have adapted to the problem of generation. We can consider them as an extension of Reichenbach's markers [18].

Reference-contexts: At this moment, we do not know how to produce this discourse structure, but we are planning to work on this problem. In particular, we will try to use the results of the work done other researchers who tried to apply the SDRT to the analysis process <ref> [10, 4] </ref>. In the discourse structure of our example, we have one sentence that is to be elaborated by two other sentences. These two sentences constitutes a narration.

Reference-contexts: We have developed a formalism to express the variety of possibilities to designate temporal segments represented by these constants. Due to space limitations this formalism is not presented here (for more detail see <ref> [5] </ref>). In the illustrated DRS we give for these constants an English description. The constant n represents the speech time, In the representation, we specify that it is included in a time represented by ct 3 , which is the day corresponding to September 11 1992 . <p> For example, to generate hier (yesterday) we need more systems than what is contain in the grammar at figure 6. Also, we have not introduced all the systems that are needed to generate the durative forms of localizer. For an exhaustive description, see <ref> [5] </ref>. To illustrate the realization process, we will see how a few forms of temporal adverbial phrases can be generated. A 8h10 (at 8:00 am) To obtain this form the following features must be selected in the grammar: primary, autonomous, direct, chronological and other .

Reference-contexts: That is, if we consider only the temporal relations expressed in the conceptual representation, occurrences and times are not disinguishable. This facilitates the expression of temporal localization in many different ways, which is an important issue in text generation. In <ref> [6] </ref> we present an ontology of time that take advantage of this important characteristic of DRT. <p> To achieve the translation of the SDRS, we effectuate a depth-first traversal of the DRSs in the discourse structure. For each DRS visited, we establish its corresponding feature structure in the semantic representation. 1 In <ref> [6] </ref> we propose an implementation of such a structure n ct 3 a l p b r plane (a) flight (l) city (p) Paris (p) city (b) Barcelona (b) engine (r) ct 3 = Sept. 11 1992 n ae ct 3 o 1 : make (a,l) ct 1 = Sept. 10

Reference-contexts: For S 2 , the semantics of the localizer requires the selection of durati in ASPECT LOC. 3.3 Syntactic realization In Sytemic Grammar Theory the syntactic realization relies on a functional analysis of the sentence, as explained by Halliday in <ref> [7] </ref>. He consider that sentences have many meanings: logical, thematic and interpersonal meanings. Each phrase in the sentence has a function for each of these sentence meanings. The construction of the syntactic structure results from the solving constraints of different type.

Reference-contexts: But there are many problems with the method proposed. Mainly, the method governing the planning process is too much determined by the temporal concepts.

Also, this proposal is not really successful in integrating in the generator all the expressive potential of a language like French for the expression of time. Here a different perspective is adopted.

Reference-contexts: Brackets identify systems that must be processed concurrently. The syntactic structure of the adverbial phrase is determined by a set of constraints entailed by features selected in a complete traversal of the network. To implement the selection of features, we use a method inspired by the inquiries of Nigel <ref> [11] </ref>. We will now give an overview of how the network can be used to produce an adverbial phrase.

Reference-contexts: It is the discourse structure that specifies the segmentation of the message into sentences. which extends the DRT by adding to it the notions of rhetorical relations such as the one propose in the RST <ref> [13] </ref>. We call SDRS such a discourse structure. It contains the same information as in the DRS of figure 1 except that it has been segmented. We see that the top-level DRS contains three small DRSs which are related by rhetorical relations: each DRS corresponds to a sentence.

Reference-contexts: The advantage of this framework is the possibility of expressing the syntactic aspect of a sentence as resulting from a sequence of semantic choices.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Until now, few generators have been developed to solve satisfactorily the problem of the expression of time. Furthermore, the ones which address this problem focus on the production of verb tenses, without offering a convincing solution to the choice of temporal adverbs. In <ref> [15] </ref>, a method is proposed for integrating the expression of temporal concepts in the process of text generation. In particular, it shows how to produce different types of text in French from a single representation of events. But there are many problems with the method proposed.

Of course, it is not possible to develop a method for surface generation without considering the higher levels, at least partially. Therefore, in this paper, we will present not only a surface generator, but the solutions that are suggested by our method at the deep level process. <p> With the four markers N, R, P and L, this combined with the great expressive power of the semantics used to represent the localizer L, we are able to generate most of the patterns identified by <ref> [17] </ref> for temporal adverbs. Thus, the generation of the temporal adverbs, once the semantic structure has been established, can be considered independent of the domain. However, at the level of the translation process from the conceptual level into the semantic one, the situation is different.

To identify the value of these four features, at least two information have to be considered: The other DRSs to which the visited DRS is attached in the discourse struc ture The rhetorical relations The marker N represents the time of speech.
