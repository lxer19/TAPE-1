Title: Testing for Parametric Faults in Static CMOS Circuits

Abstract: Many defects causing bridges, breaks, and transistor stuck-ons in static CMOS circuits are not detected by tests generated using the traditional single stuck-at fault model. These undetected, non-traditional faults may be detected as increased propagation time or as excessive quiescent power supply current (I DDQ ). In this paper we compare the cost of testing for excess I DDQ caused by bridge, break and transistors stuck-on

Reference-contexts: Even with a manufacturing yield of 95%, 99.6% of the defects must be detected for a 200 DPM quality level. Defect simulation experiments have shown that the vast majority of all local defects in MOS technologies cause changes in circuit description that result in bridges, breaks, and transistor stuck-ons <ref> [18, 2] </ref>. Most, but not all, of these are detected by SSF tests. Bridges, breaks, and transistor stuck-ons can be undetectable as logical faults and still cause an IC to be unacceptable for shipment because of performance degradation due to delay faults or loss of reliability. <p> For the analyzed standard cell layouts mentioned previously, these three fault types accounted for over 99% of all faults likely to be caused by local defects <ref> [2] </ref>. For the analyzed cells, approximately 48% were bridges, 42% breaks, and 10% were transistor stuck-ons. (A significant type of defect that we do not consider is the gate oxide short.

Reference-contexts: In a defect simulation experiment involving over 400,000 defects and two industrial standard cells, greater than 40% of the defects could not be modeled as single stuck-at faults <ref> [3] </ref>. In the same series of experiments, half of the defects (those that caused electrical shorts between adjacent circuit nodes) were fault simulated with an SSF test set provided by the circuits' manufacturer: At least 10% of the bridges were not detected by the SSF test set.

Reference-contexts: This defect is a special type of bridge between the gate node of a transistor and either its source, drain, or channel region. These shorts are often activated after manufacture by burn-in procedures <ref> [4] </ref>. We will not explicitly consider them because they can be detected using the techniques we present for detecting bridges and transistors stuck-on defects.) Before examining testing procedures to detect bridges, breaks and transistor stuck-ons, we should consider how these faults affect the circuit's behavior and under what circumstances.

Reference-contexts: To detect these non-logical faults requires that nonlogical testing be employed. In a recent experiment, the addition of I DDQ monitoring to functional testing increased the capture of defective chips by 1.6 and 2.8 times <ref> [5] </ref>. In this paper we compare testing strategies that will detect these common defects, which may not be detected by SSF test sets. Since common terminology will be very important in our analysis, we will review some definitions before examining the testing strategies. <p> Some inputs to a gate with a transistor stuck-on will cause a significant increase in I DDQ . These inputs are the same as those that would be needed to sensitize (but not propagate) a single stuck-at fault on the input corresponding to the stuck-on transistor <ref> [13, 20, 19, 5] </ref>. The set of inputs that will detect the transistor stuck-on as an I DDQ fault is the same as the set of stimulating inputs for an SSF on the same node [12, 17].

Reference-contexts: An alternative testing strategy relies on additional current between the bridged nodes when each node is being driven to a different logic value. For fully static CMOS circuits this causes a substantial and easily measurable increase in I DDQ <ref> [6] </ref>. An I DDQ test for a bridge requires that the two bridged nodes have different logic values during the test and that the excess power supply current is measured.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, Table 2 shows the SSF fault coverage of the ISCAS benchmark circuits when up to 16,000,000 random vectors are simulated. Table 2 was generated using single vector detection probabilities generated by Leendert Huisman of IBM using a fault simulation engine <ref> [7] </ref>. The last line of Table 2 shows the ratio of the number of stuck-at vectors required to achieve the coverage and the number of stuck-on vectors required to achieve the same coverage.

Reference-contexts: If the transistors with the floating gates are permanently conducting, the behavior of the gate would be the same as a transistor stuck-on. Recent research suggests that transistor pairs with floating gates, as in Figure 2-b, are likely to have one conducting and one not conducting transistor <ref> [14] </ref>. This would behave like a SSF (although the situation is complicated by the existence of capacitive coupling between floating gates and adjacent nodes [20]). <p> As previously mentioned, we will assume that single floating transistors are conducting <ref> [14] </ref>. To summarize, some, but not all, breaks can be detected as logical faults, and some, but not all, breaks can be detected as delay faults or I DDQ faults. 2.3 Transistor Stuck-ons A transistor stuck-on is a transistor that is always in the conducting mode.

Reference-contexts: This is quite significant since IC manufacturers typically claim quality levels of less than 200 defective parts per million (DPM). If the fabrication process has a yield of 75%, then the manufacturing tests must detect 99.93% of the yield affecting defects to reach this quality level <ref> [15] </ref>. Even with a manufacturing yield of 95%, 99.6% of the defects must be detected for a 200 DPM quality level.

This is because standard delay tests require a sequence of inputs, and the sequence must produce a glitch-free path to propagate the delay error. <p> It may not be able to detect all defects. Detecting all defects as delay faults may be difficult or impossible. The constraints for delay fault detection for bridge, break, and transistor stuck-on defects make it difficult to generate robust tests (those that are not potentially invalidated by hazards <ref> [16] </ref>). Non-robust tests may not detect the delay fault. A major advantage to detecting bridge, break, and transistor stuck-on defects as I DDQ faults is that test 5 generation is much less expensive than for SSFs and fewer test vectors are needed than are needed for SSF test sets.

Reference-contexts: The logical behavior of a CMOS gate is often more complicated than this and is affected by transistor sizing, topology (transistors in parallel are generally stronger than transistors in series), and manufacturing process variations <ref> [20] </ref>. Whatever the logical function of the bridge fault, it may not be possible to meet the requirements for detecting a logic fault with a single test, even if the circuit is not redundant. Consider the bridging fault in Figure 1. <p> Recent research suggests that transistor pairs with floating gates, as in Figure 2-b, are likely to have one conducting and one not conducting transistor [14]. This would behave like a SSF (although the situation is complicated by the existence of capacitive coupling between floating gates and adjacent nodes <ref> [20] </ref>). The same research suggests that break faults that cause the gates of only nFET or only pFET gates to float in a gate, as in Figure 2-a, will cause those transistors to be stuck-on. These can be detected by the methods presented for transistor stuck-on faults. <p> Many transistor stuck-ons do not change the logical function of the gate. As in bridge defects, the transistor width to length ratios, the topology of the circuit, and manufacturing process variations determine if specific transistor stuck-ons cause logical faults <ref> [20] </ref>. If the nFET controlled by the input signal y in Figure 3 is stuck-on, the logical function of the circuit is likely to be the same as if the y input were stuck-at 1. This is because the single nFET is probably stronger than two pFETs in series. <p> Some inputs to a gate with a transistor stuck-on will cause a significant increase in I DDQ . These inputs are the same as those that would be needed to sensitize (but not propagate) a single stuck-at fault on the input corresponding to the stuck-on transistor <ref> [13, 20, 19, 5] </ref>. The set of inputs that will detect the transistor stuck-on as an I DDQ fault is the same as the set of stimulating inputs for an SSF on the same node [12, 17].

Reference-contexts: If the defect breaks some, but not all, paths from either V SS or V DD to the gate's output, the gate will behave like a dynamic sequential circuit <ref> [21] </ref>. Signal-line breaks in static CMOS designs result in transistors with floating gates.
