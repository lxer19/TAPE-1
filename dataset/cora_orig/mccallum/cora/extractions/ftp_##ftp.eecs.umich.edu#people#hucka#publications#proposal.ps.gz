Abstract: For many purposes, knowing where things are in one's immediate environment is just as important as knowing what they are. Humans and other natural systems are very adept at extracting such spatial information from vision. They do it rapidly, automatically, and often seem to make do with only approximate information. Without the time or opportunity to perform a careful analysis of one's environment, a rough assessment of the spatial organization of visible structures in the environment may be all the visual system can extract. Nevertheless, such an approximate analysis, while devoid of information about shapes and other details useful for object recognition, would still be valuable. It could serve as a starting point for other visual processes and a basis for decisions in situations where time and available information are limited. In this research, I will focus on the question of how the visual system can obtain an initial estimate of the spatial layout of a scene. The hypothesis I will explore is that the system extracts the approximate locations, sizes and spatial orientations of major elements in the visual input, thereby obtaining a rough sketch of the spatial layout. More specifically, I propose that the visual system can use a texture-based approach for both rough scene segmentation and estimation of the organization of visible structures. One of the goals of this research is to develop a biologically reasonable model of visual processing capable of extracting rough spatial layout information from static images of natural scenes.

Reference-contexts: This argues against Stevens's (1981) hypothesis that the system mainly uses local measures. It also argues against the biological plausibility of some machine vision approaches to shape from texture that rely on finding individual texture elements and computing shape from these <ref> (Ahuja, 1992) </ref>. Instead, it suggests that the visual system uses variations across a population of elements.

Reference-contexts: A loose analogy is often made to "energy" mechanisms, in the sense that the response of a complex cell can be thought of as representing the amount of a particular type of spatial structure, such as texture, within its tuning range and its region of spatial pooling <ref> (Bergen and Landy, 1991) </ref>. The cell is insensitive to more specific qualities of the stimulus such as its exact distribution within the cell's receptive field. corresponds roughly to the first stages of several existing models (Bergen and Landy, 1991; Bovik, Clark and Geisler, 1990; Fogel and Sagi, 1989; Turner, 1986). <p> If the model described above is roughly correct, it suggests that complex cells compute higher-order properties across groups of simple cells <ref> (Bergen and Landy, 1991) </ref>. Indeed, the complex cell as defined above computes a spatially localized sum of the normalized outputs of a set of spatiotemporal filters having a limited range of frequency tunings, and this is actually proportional to the localized Fourier spectrum.

Reference-contexts: Further, complex cells are also insensitive to contrast polarity, meaning that they respond whether the stimulus is brighter or darker than the background <ref> (Ohzawa, DeAngelis and Freeman, 1990) </ref>. These properties cannot be implemented by linearly summing the outputs of discrete excitatory and inhibitory subregions within a receptive 11 field; the neural mechanisms must include nonlinear operations, such as something equivalent to the mathematical operation of absolute value. <p> A version of this model is illustrated in This model does have its failings: some complex cells have properties that are not present in simple cells and cannot be derived from a summation of simple cell outputs <ref> (De Valois and De Valois, 1990) </ref>, and there is evidence that some complex cells may have direct inputs from the LGN. However, the simple cell summation scheme has so far turned out to be a reasonable working model (Heeger, 1992a; Heeger, 1992b).

By being sensitive to different spatial frequencies in the visual input, the different sensors of a visual system can respond to different spatial scales.

Reference-contexts: The squaring component provides for cell outputs that are more consistent with experimental results <ref> (Heeger, 1992a) </ref>. Together, half-wave rectification and squaring can be expressed as "half-squaring": A (t) = bL (t)c 2 where L (t) is the response of a purely linear filter, bL (t)c = max (x; 0), and A (t) is the half-squared result.

Reference-contexts: This implies that the mechanisms involved in producing global precedence depend on the coarse-grained spatial information in the visual input. Hughes et al. therefore suggested that under certain conditions, "global spatial structure might be directly encoded by low-frequency mechanisms rather than by hierarchical feature processing" <ref> (Hughes et al., 1990, p. 273) </ref>. The results of a different type of experiment carried out by Schyns and Oliva (1994) also argue for a predominantly coarse-to-fine process in scene recognition.

Reference-contexts: In fact, for a variety of experimental conditions, reaction times increase monotonically with increasing stimulus spatial frequency (Parker and Dutch, 1987). This further strengthens the idea that the visual processing mechanisms associated with low spatial frequencies are responsible for global precedence effects <ref> (Hughes, Nozawa and Kitterle, 1995) </ref>. As mentioned in previous sections, this suggests an approach for performing a rough segregation of the visual inputs in the presence of textures.

Reference-contexts: Somewhat less than 10% of the total ganglion outputs are projected to a structure called the superior colliculus (Perry and Cowey, 1984). The remaining ganglion outputs go to several intermediate structures that handle such functions as controlling the pupils of the eyes in response to overall changes in brightness <ref> (Kandel et al., 1991) </ref>, and beyond having these simple functions, these structures are not believed to play a role in the visual information processing that leads to awareness of space and objects. Figure 6 summarizes some of these visual pathways.

Reference-contexts: Further, many tasks requiring information about spatial organization can be performed adequately using only approximate layout information. For instance, the agent may be able to make preliminary assessments of qualities that can help guide its behavior, judging different settings in terms of their options for movement and action <ref> (Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989) </ref>. There is also experimental evidence suggesting that even a rough representation of a scene, when presented very briefly to human subjects, is enough to allow scene discrimination (Schyns and Oliva, 1994).

Reference-contexts: Without time or opportunity to perform a more careful analysis, the system may only be able to extract a rough sketch of the spatial layout of a scene. However, this kind of basic spatial information would be sufficient to fulfill the requirements above <ref> (Kaplan and Kaplan, 1982) </ref>. In less constrained situations, an initial, qualitative assessment of layout could serve as a stepping-stone to more extensive spatial analysis.

Reference-contexts: It is a robust effect for many task conditions and stimuli; however, perception of visual patterns does not necessarily proceed from global to local under all conditions. For example, if the stimulus patterns are magnified, eventually global precedence gives way to local precedence <ref> (Kinchla and Wolfe, 1979) </ref>, and if the patterns are made sparse, again local precedence can occur (Martin, 1979).

Reference-contexts: They also argue that size and location are intimately related: "size can be conceived of as the number of small locations an object occupies", and indeed, "local aspects of shape are no more than the distribution of locations occupied by small portions of an object . . . " <ref> (Kosslyn et al., 1990, p. 219) </ref>. 3.5 Variations in Texture Patterns as a Useful Source of Information The discussion so far has focused on how the visual system can roughly segment the input into regions and how it can represent the location and size of each region.

Reference-contexts: A loose analogy is often made to "energy" mechanisms, in the sense that the response of a complex cell can be thought of as representing the amount of a particular type of spatial structure, such as texture, within its tuning range and its region of spatial pooling <ref> (Bergen and Landy, 1991) </ref>. The cell is insensitive to more specific qualities of the stimulus such as its exact distribution within the cell's receptive field. corresponds roughly to the first stages of several existing models (Bergen and Landy, 1991; Bovik, Clark and Geisler, 1990; Fogel and Sagi, 1989; Turner, 1986). <p> If the model described above is roughly correct, it suggests that complex cells compute higher-order properties across groups of simple cells <ref> (Bergen and Landy, 1991) </ref>. Indeed, the complex cell as defined above computes a spatially localized sum of the normalized outputs of a set of spatiotemporal filters having a limited range of frequency tunings, and this is actually proportional to the localized Fourier spectrum.

Reference-contexts: The different elements of a scene give rise to patterns occurring at a variety of size scales, because different objects in the world exist as meaningful entities at different ranges of scales <ref> (Lindeberg and ter Haar Romeny, 1994) </ref>. Flowers, for example, can be described sensibly only for the range of a few millimeters to a few meters; it is not meaningful to discuss them at the scales of nanometers or kilometers. <p> These sensors will necessarily have a finite aperture size. The kind of information that can be extracted will depend upon the relationship between the sizes of the sensor apertures and the sizes of the structures in the input <ref> (Lindeberg and ter Haar Romeny, 1994) </ref>. A basic tradeoff is that to resolve small-scale details, small apertures are needed, but these will only take in a small amount of a physical entity.

Reference-contexts: condition: the sizes of the numerals do correspond. 22 old infants react to various transformations of simple visual stimuli such as a larger circle con-taining two smaller, filled circles inside of it (Kagan, Linn, Mount, Reznick and Hiatt, 1979; Linn, Reznick, Kagan and Hans, 1982), or a simple block shape <ref> (Linn, Hans and Kagan, 1978) </ref>. The results show that young infants are more sensitive to changes in the sizes of the stimuli than to a number of other transformations such as changes in shape. Again, this supports the idea that size assessment is a basic process.

Reference-contexts: Further, complex cells are also insensitive to contrast polarity, meaning that they respond whether the stimulus is brighter or darker than the background <ref> (Ohzawa, DeAngelis and Freeman, 1990) </ref>. These properties cannot be implemented by linearly summing the outputs of discrete excitatory and inhibitory subregions within a receptive 11 field; the neural mechanisms must include nonlinear operations, such as something equivalent to the mathematical operation of absolute value.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the output of a real simple cell can be assumed to consist of a linear spatial summation step followed by a rectification process, so that what would be negative values in an idealized filter are set to zero in the real neuron <ref> (Palmer et al., 1991) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In fact, for a variety of experimental conditions, reaction times increase monotonically with increasing stimulus spatial frequency <ref> (Parker and Dutch, 1987) </ref>. This further strengthens the idea that the visual processing mechanisms associated with low spatial frequencies are responsible for global precedence effects (Hughes, Nozawa and Kitterle, 1995).

Reference-contexts: It fits with the idea that the system will compute just what it needs, and not more. "The goal of biological visual systems is to rapidly compute approximate solutions to perceptual problems. The solutions are always adequate for the job on hand, but rarely optimal" <ref> (Ramachandran, 1990, p. 23) </ref>. 1.2 Overview of the Research The problem I am focusing on is the question of how the visual system can extract an initial, rough estimate of spatial layout. Behavioral, neurophysiological and computational evidence are all relevant to this question.

Reference-contexts: Cortical simple cells are generally not effective texture detectors by themselves, since the spatial organization of a simple cell receptive field requires a stimulus to be positioned properly in order to active the cell strongly <ref> (Sakai and Finkel, 1995) </ref>. Unlike a simple cell, however, a complex cell is not particularly sensitive to the position of the stimulus within its receptive fields.

Reference-contexts: Texture is a property of areas and its definition necessarily involves spatial regions rather than points <ref> (Tamura, Mori and Yamawaki, 1978) </ref>. Texture is all around us: all physical surfaces are textured, some more roughly and visibly than others.

Reference-contexts: directly on assumptions about the regularity of the shapes of the physical texture elements. "It appears instead that the observers' judgments [are] based on a more global level of image structure, which [can] apparently provide sufficient information to overcome significant amounts of noise in the local structure of individual elements" <ref> (Todd and Akerstrom, 1987, p. 246) </ref>. This argues against Stevens's (1981) hypothesis that the system mainly uses local measures. It also argues against the biological plausibility of some machine vision approaches to shape from texture that rely on finding individual texture elements and computing shape from these (Ahuja, 1992).

Reference-contexts: For many purposes this would be far too much information, and in fact it is extremely unlikely that our visual systems expend the effort necessary to compute such detailed information <ref> (Watt, 1995) </ref>. A description that captures the spatial organization created by the major elements in the scene, but in less detail, can be called an approximate spatial layout representation. Figure 1 depicts an example of this. <p> A region of texture is characterized by some degree of statistical similarity between the individual features in every part of the region. Two regions will usually be treated as distinct if the variations within their respective patterns are less than the variations between the two patterns <ref> (Watt, 1995) </ref>. Visual texture information can serve many functions, as Gibson (1950) first pointed out. Different surfaces in a scene typically can be located, discriminated, and segregated based on their textures.

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, one risks having an unmanageable mess that is too difficult to study and understand, and even if it works, it will be difficult to determine which mechanisms are necessary and which are superfluous <ref> (Weaver, 1993) </ref>. 33 2. Experiment with the simulated model and determine how and where the model fails. This is a critical component of the approach; it guides the next modification to the model.

Reference-contexts: Surface qualities such as friction can also be judged, and often the identity of the material composing the surface can be determined based on its texture <ref> (Yuille and Ullman, 1990) </ref>. Watt (1988; 1995) has suggested another powerful use of texture: handling complexity in interpreting visual information. In many situations, the visual system processes coarse spatial scales for spatial relationships between regions, whereas it processes fine scales for information about surface qualities.

Reference-contexts: This implies that the early neural representations of regions and their locations are in retinal coordinates. In area V1, which has the most precise retinotopic map <ref> (Zeki, 1993) </ref>, the visual system has direct information about the locations of stimulus components in retinal coordinates simply on the basis of the location of neural activity.
