Abstract: As part of the DARPA Rapid Design Exploration and Optimization (RaDEO) program, Boeing, Philadelphia, is involved in an ongoing concurrent design engineering research project called MADEsmart which seeks to partially automate the Integrated Product Team (IPT) concept used by Boeing for organizing the design engineering process, with the aid of intelligent agent technology. Although currently only in an early stage of development, the project is expected to crucially employ a constraint-centered System Design Management Agent developed by the University of Toronto's IE Department in conjunction with Boeing. The SDMA will use the constraint-based Toronto Ontologies for a Virtual Enterprise (TOVE) ontologies, and its domain theories for design engineering and dependent underlying theories, phrased as KIF/Ontolingua assertions in an axiomatic system running in the constraint logic system ECLiPSe, as its primary knowledge resource to monitor an ongoing design project, offering resource-allocation, coordinationstrategic, and risk-abatement suggestions to the interacting agents as best it can. In addition, the underlying domain model and agent architecture for MADEsmart will employ primitive constraint notions to facilitate the design engineering process. These constraints will be evaluated by a given agent at goal commitment time, during planning, scheduling, or execution of tasks. This paper describes the expected interaction of constraints and agents of this ongoing research.

Reference-contexts: Agents, Agent Infrastructure, and Constraints The current model of an individual agent in MADEsmart is displayed in Figure 1, and is described below. This TAEMS-centric view of the agent considers an intelligent agent as communicating with other agents - in MADEsmart, using a version of KQML <ref> (Finin et al. 1993) </ref> - and being locally responsible for the planning, scheduling, and execution of task structures, though those tasks may have nonlocal effects on other agents or be non-locally affected by other agents.

Reference-contexts: Another aspect of the interaction between agents and constraints in MADEsmart is in our use of the cost model COSTADE <ref> (Mabson et al. 1996) </ref>, to drive design analysis (including producibility, stress, and weights analysis), MultiDisciplinary Optimization, and preliminary and detailed design. COSTADE is a Fortran-based model we may wish to partially disentangle and map components to the constraint logic-based SDMA.
