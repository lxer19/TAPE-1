Abstract: 2. A store that stocks a certain commodity uses the following (S; s) ordering policy: if its supply at the beginning of a time-period is x, then it orders 0 if x s and S x otherwise. The order is immediately filled. The daily demans are independent and equal j with probability ff j . All demands that cannot be immediately met are lost. Let X n denote the inventory level at the end of the nth time period. Argue that fX n g is a Markov chain and compute its transition probabilities. 3. Let fX i g be a sequence of i.i.d. rv's such that P (X i = j) = ff j , j 0. Say that a record occurs at time n if X n is larger than all the previous X i 's. (Assume that a record always occurs at time 1.) If a record occurs at time n, then call X n the record value. Let R i be the ith record value. 4. a) A Markov chain has absorbing state 0, i.e. p 00 = 1, and all the other states are transient. Let T i be the time it takes to reach state 0 given it starts in state i, and let M i = E(T i ), Show that for i &gt; 0, Show that the progress for the hunt, except for knowing the location where it ends, can be described by a 3-state Markov chain with one absorbing state. Obtain the transition matrix for this chain, and find the probability at time n the spider and the fly are both at their initial locations. What is the average duration of the hunt? a) Argue that fR i g is a Markov chain and compute its transition probabilities.
