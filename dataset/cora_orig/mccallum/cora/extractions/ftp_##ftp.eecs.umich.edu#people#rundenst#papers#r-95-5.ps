Abstract: In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a scientific database for the map assembly tasks performed by the geneticists at the University of Michigan Human Genome Center. Our system manages complex genomic data and supports the automation of the associated map assembly tasks. For this purpose, we have developed an overlap refinement hierarchy characterizing the types of overlap and ordering relationships between DNA fragments. Based on this model, we designed an associated set of inference operators to automate some of the contig assembly steps, such as inferring overlap information using transitivity rules. In order to realize this map inferencing approach and to take advantage of the modeling power offered by object-oriented database technology, we have developed an active object-oriented database (OODB) system, called Crystal, on the GemStone OODB. Crystal seamlessly integrates rule inferencing with object modeling and other typical database capabilities, thus avoiding the overhead in moving data between systems for rule processing and data management, and eliminating data mismatch in these different representations. We also discuss the implementation of the physical map assembly (PMA) tool on top of Crystal, which includes the realization of the genome information model and the map assembly inferencing process. PMA executes inferencing automatically, without explicitly having to initiate rule execution, and thus can respond to the incremental addition of new experimental data. In conclusion, we provide a walk-through example and several experimental results that demonstrate how our approach can be used to support physical contig assembly.

Reference-contexts: Modeling Interval Ordering Relationships 3.1.1. Ordering refinement hierarchy of interval relationships Physical contig assembly is concerned with determining the order and position of overlapping DNA fragments spanning a chromosomal region. While some concepts from prior work in ordering of intervals, done primarily in the context of temporal ordering <ref> [1, 14] </ref>, can apply to DNA fragment ordering, there are several significant differences: * First, in genomic applications, the determination of the equality of endpoint relationships between DNA fragments is generally too costly. Hence, Allen's [1] temporal relationships that refer to equality of endpoints are not applicable to our problem. <p> Hence, Allen's <ref> [1] </ref> temporal relationships that refer to equality of endpoints are not applicable to our problem. These are the relationships meets, starts, ends and their inverses. <p> For example, if DNA fragments A and B are both hit by probe STS1, then we know A and B overlap. However, we do not know which of A and B starts first or which ends first. Allen <ref> [1] </ref> expresses a precise temporal relationship between two events as a simple relationship, whereas a partially known temporal relationship has to be expressed as a disjunction of precise relationships. In short, the less we know about a relationship between two intervals, the more complex Allen's representation becomes. <p> For example, the PARULEL language by Stolfo et al. [35] allows "meta-rules" just like Crystal. 7.2. Genome mapping and database tools Ordering and orientation of the relationships among DNA fragments are two essential concepts in our project. We find the work of Allen <ref> [1] </ref> and Letovsky and Berlyn [26] closely related to ours. Allen [1] lists all possible relationships between temporal intervals assuming complete information about their durations, and presents a transitivity table for these relationships. <p> Genome mapping and database tools Ordering and orientation of the relationships among DNA fragments are two essential concepts in our project.

Reference-contexts: The fundamental design decisions underlying Crystal can be summarized as follows: Rule integration with object modeling. There are several alternative design choices for rules, namely rules can be (1) declared within class definitions, (2) specified as data member values, or (3) treated as independent objects <ref> [2] </ref>. y GemStone is a registered trademark of Servio Corporation. AN ACTIVE OODB SYSTEM FOR GENOME PHYSICAL MAP ASSEMBLY 45 The main disadvantage of the first and second alternative is that the rule's existence is dependent on the existence of other objects. <p> Active database research has thus become an increasingly important research area in the last few years. Many active database systems have been proposed and built. For example, Starburst [37] uses a set-oriented approach to rules, and the HiPAC model [8] operates on instances of objects. ADAM [10] and Sentinel <ref> [2] </ref> are the systems probably most closely related to Crystal. Like Crystal, they both treat events and rules as first class objects. ADAM only supports a rule scope of classes, Sentinel and Crystal support both class and instance-level rule scopes, but with different meanings.

Reference-contexts: For the current Crystal system, we have chosen TREAT as the starting point, Namely, we have adopted the "pattern-based" selection conditions from TREAT (in Crystal, we called them predicates). A-TREAT <ref> [19] </ref> extends TREAT with a lazy evaluation mechanism, in the sense that A-TREAT uses "virtual alpha-memory nodes", when a selection condition has a low selectivity. This A-TREAT strategy has proven not to be applicable to our application, since selectivity of our rule conditions is evenly distributed.

Reference-contexts: A LOF allows us to represent that a set of relationships exhibits the same orientation, without having to specify whether this orientation corresponds to the original orientation of the chromosome. The local orientation frame concept is similar in spirit to the orientation windows introduced in <ref> [26] </ref> for orderings between points. As shown in Figure 5.a, knowing that a DNA fragment B is located between fragments A and C does not automatically tell us the true global orientation, which could be either "A before B before C" or "C before B before A". <p> For example, the PARULEL language by Stolfo et al.

Reference-contexts: An object model for physical map assembly Next, we introduce the core of the object schema that we have developed to capture genomic data types relevant for physical mapping (Figure 3). The notation used in Figure 3 corresponds to the Object Modeling Technology proposed by Rumbaugh et al. <ref> [33] </ref>. The object schema y can be roughly divided into two parts. The left hand side, such as Library, Probe, and Clone, covers concepts related to the genomic experiments. <p> The research group directed by Markowitz et al.

Reference-contexts: In Crystal, the ProdRule class is a subclass of the ActiveObject class, therefore, rules are capable of receiving and issuing notifications (i.e., event signalings) themselves. The concept of meta-rules as supported by PMA has also been investigated by other researchers. For example, the PARULEL language by Stolfo et al. <ref> [35] </ref> allows "meta-rules" just like Crystal. 7.2. Genome mapping and database tools Ordering and orientation of the relationships among DNA fragments are two essential concepts in our project. We find the work of Allen [1] and Letovsky and Berlyn [26] closely related to ours.

Reference-contexts: Instead, the scientist may use a visualization tool to view the physical maps generated by our system to resolve conflicts manually. We have implemented a PMA visualizer using the tk/tcl toolkit and are in the process of integrating it with the PMA tool <ref> [36] </ref>. Figures 19 and 20 in the experimental section (Section 6) depict some of the sample displays generated by the PMA visualizer. Suggestions about resolving conflicts can be fed back into PMA, e.g., by removing some conflicting overlaps from the current working set. <p> Example of cosmid hybridization with conflicting ordering relationships Here, we describe an example that leads to the discovery of conflicting ordering relationships. Our goal is twofold: (1) to demonstrate how our system detects conflicting data, and (2) to demonstrate how the PMA visualizer <ref> [36] </ref> lets us see the results of ordering the clones, to help solve conflicts in the original data, and to help direct further research using the ordered contig. <p> Removing these positive reactions from the experimental data then allows PMA to compute a single consistent ordering (Figure 20). Fig. 19: Visualizing conflicts from PMA. Fig. 20: A consistent contig. A more detailed discussion of experimental results and usage of visualizer are discussed <ref> [36] </ref>. y The heavy black lines show plausible placements of each of the probes and clones. The gray ambiguity bars show the range within which the endpoints of each interval may vary while remaining consistent with the rest of the data. The dashed ambiguity bars show possible conflicts. <p> We also plan to add a certainty propagation and conflict resolution mechanism as well as new types of inference rules, e.g., concerning distance, to our system. We see the development of tightly integrated visualization tools with PMA (such as, the PMA-visualizer <ref> [36] </ref>) as one key feature which is pre-requisite for ultimately achieving the acceptance of the system by geneticists and other potential users. In the long term, database research for genomic applications must address the problemsa concerning the integration of heterogeneous systems and the continuous evolution of software and databases [30].

Reference-contexts: Active database research has thus become an increasingly important research area in the last few years. Many active database systems have been proposed and built. For example, Starburst <ref> [37] </ref> uses a set-oriented approach to rules, and the HiPAC model [8] operates on instances of objects. ADAM [10] and Sentinel [2] are the systems probably most closely related to Crystal. Like Crystal, they both treat events and rules as first class objects.
