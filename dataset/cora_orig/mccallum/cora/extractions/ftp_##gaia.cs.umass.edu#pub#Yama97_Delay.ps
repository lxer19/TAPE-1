Abstract: A growing number of network applications require the use of a reliable multicast protocol to disseminate data from a source to a potentially large number of receivers. This paper presents an analytic performance analysis of the packet delay incurred under three generic sender- and receiver-initiated approaches towards reliable multicast. We focus on the host processing requirements of these protocols and derive expressions for average time between the initial arrival of a packet at a sender and its correct reception at a randomly chosen receiver. Our numerical results indicate that a NAK-based protocol that limits NAK generation by intentionally and randomly delaying NAK packets can achieve substantially higher throughput than the other two protocols examined, and can do so without suffering an appreciable higher delay over a range of system parameters.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A growing number of network applications require the use of a reliable multicast protocol to disseminate data from a source to a potentially large number of receivers. These applications include whiteboard teleconferencing <ref> [1] </ref>, distribution of financial and billing data [4], and distributed interactive simulation . An earlier paper by Pin-gali et al.[6] identified two basic approaches towards reliable multicast sender-initiated ACK-based protocols and receiver-initiated NAK-based protocols and examined the maximum achievable sender and receiver throughputs for these approaches. <p> As suggested by Ramakrish-nan and Jain [7] for a LAN and Jacobson and Floyd <ref> [1] </ref> for a WAN, it limits the number of NAKs generated using a NAK suppression mechanism. With NAK suppression, each receiver multicasts its NAK only after waiting a random amount of time after detecting packet loss. <p> As with the sender-initiated protocols, there are numerous optimizations possible. For example, it is possible for a receiver that has correctly received a packet to itself retransmit a copy of the packet <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> As with the sender-initiated protocols, there are numerous optimizations possible. For example, it is possible for a receiver that has correctly received a packet to itself retransmit a copy of the packet [1].

In [10] we also treat a pessimistic scenario where every NAK triggers a retransmission. Under this scenario, the sender processes three flows. The first corresponds to the original transmissions.
