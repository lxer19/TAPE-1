Abstract: Several recent studies indicate that (i) dependent packet arrivals can have a significant impact on buffer-overflow probabilities and delay characteristics at a network multiplexor, with long-range dependence showing a larger impact than short-range dependence, and (ii) that traffic in several different campus-level network environments appears to be long-range dependent. These two related issues are beginning to make a significant impact on traffic theory and network resource management. The objective of this paper is to show that long-range dependence extends to wide-area networks as well, and to identify the factors contributing to it. In particular, we find the presence of long-range dependence in packet level traffic over the NSFNET wide-area network. The analysis is based on raw traffic data collected from multiple NSFNET core switches distributed across the US.

Reference-contexts: n )=n decays as 1=n as n ! 1; and its power spectral density is finite as w ! 0: Several recent studies have shown that buffer-overflow probabilities and delay statistics for a single queue with long-range dependent arrivals are significantly larger than that with independent or short-range dependent arrivals <ref> [1, 14, 16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: level factors in TCP traffic on observed long-range dependence. (i) and (ii) are based on traffic measurements over several geographically dispersed core switches on the NSFNET. (iii) is based on a systematic study of the effect of TCP application parameters (factors) on long-range dependence through a set of designed experiments <ref> [6, 22] </ref>. The results of this paper support and extend the traffic results of Leland et al [23] and Paxon and Floyd [30] to larger sub-nets. Table 1 summarizes the main results. <p> The response variables of the experiments were chosen to be the Hurst coefficient (a measure of long-range dependence, defined in Section 3). The effect of each factor on each response variable was then quantified using Analysis of Variance with nested factors <ref> [6] </ref>. This led to the identification of the factors and their levels that lead to high ^ H estimates for TCP traffic. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the network environment, the traffic measurement procedure, and post-processing of the data. <p> The variation in the response is then studied using a set of statistical analysis methods to understand how the response depends on the underlying phenomena that the factors represent (see <ref> [6, 19, 22] </ref>). We developed a set of experiments to understand the underlying phenomena in TCP traffic that cause long-range dependence. The experiments were organized along a full factorial design using four factors with three levels per factor. <p> log (Rate) was approximately a linear function of log (#Packets) plus a Normally distributed residual: Rate ~ a (#Packets) + b + *; (15) where * is a Normally distributed random variable with mean near 0:0 and variance 0:61: The Generalized Linear Model fit algorithm (glm) in the S+ package <ref> [6] </ref> gave a = 0:39; and b = 0:38: Figure 8 shows a sample of the transformed data along with the fit. The graph on the left of Figure 8 is the actual trace data; the graph on the right illustrates rates generated using Equation (15). <p> Observe that a given instance of rate is dependent on the number of packets per conversation, and the packet interarrival time in turn depends on the rate. While this is not acceptable in simple linear least-squares regression analysis, it is admissible in designed experiments using a nested factors model <ref> [6, Chapter 5] </ref>. When the levels of some dependent factor are only meaningful given the levels of some primary factor, the dependent factor is said to be nested within the primary factor. <p> The results were obtained using the S+ <ref> [6, 33] </ref> Analysis of Variance algorithm (aov) to fit the model described by Equation 16.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, it is found that: (i) The (marginal) distribution of conversation duration, Z; is heavy tailed with P (Z = k) / k fi2 ; 0 &lt; fi &lt; 1: A theorem due to Cox and Isham <ref> [9] </ref> states that this, in conjunction with (a) Poisson conversation arrivals and (b) unit transmission rate per active conversation, results in second-order self-similarity (special case of long-range dependence) in the packet arrival process. (ii) The (marginal) distribution of the number of packets per conversation is heavy tailed. (iii) The average transmission <p> These conversations were excluded from the analysis to simplify data processing. 3 Background on Long-Range Dependence 3.1 Long-range and short-range dependence We begin with a brief overview of long-range and short-range dependence in time series data. The interested reader is referred to Cox's excellent review of the subject <ref> [9] </ref>. Readers familiar with this topic may skip this section. <p> j (m) g denote the sample mean of X jmm+1 X jm ; i.e., (m) = m Let v m ; ffl k (m) g denote the variance, the auto-covariance and the auto-correlation functions of fX j (m) g: Then v 1 = v and v m is given by <ref> [9] </ref> v m = E 1 (X jmm+1 + + X jm ) E m 2 = m 2 m X (m k)fl k ; (4) v + m 2 s=1 k=1 Equation (4) follows from (3) by expanding the first term, applying the definition of fl k ; and simplifying. <p> Hence a plot of log [R (n)=S (n)] versus log (n) should display an asymptotically linear trend with slope 1=2 as n ! 1: However, for long-range dependent processes, E [R (n)=S (n)] is asymptotically proportional to n H <ref> [9, 20] </ref>. <p> The objective of this design was to determine the sensitivity of H on different application-level factors. 5.2.2 Potential causes Intuition, in conjunction with the following result due to Cox and Isham (see <ref> [9] </ref>), guided the choice of factors and their levels. Theorem 1 (Cox and Isham's Immigration/Death Model [9]:) Let fY t g denote the arrival process of new immigrants into a population. <p> The objective of this design was to determine the sensitivity of H on different application-level factors. 5.2.2 Potential causes Intuition, in conjunction with the following result due to Cox and Isham (see <ref> [9] </ref>), guided the choice of factors and their levels. Theorem 1 (Cox and Isham's Immigration/Death Model [9]:) Let fY t g denote the arrival process of new immigrants into a population. Let the life-times of individual arrivals be denoted as fZ n g; (n = 0; 1; 2; ); where Z n is the life-time of the nth immigrant. <p> Intuitively, one might expect packet-level traffic to "smooth out" at larger time scales, especially when the number of conversations is large. However, empirical evidence suggests otherwise. The primary reason for this is the heavy-tailed nature of the afore-mentioned distributions and Theorem 1 <ref> [9] </ref>. Recall that the Central Limit Theorem holds only for i.i.d. variables with finite variance. Mandelbrot and Van Ness have shown that H ! 1=2 for short-range dependent processes as well.

Reference-contexts: The results of this paper support and extend the traffic results of Leland et al [23] and Paxon and Floyd <ref> [30] </ref> to larger sub-nets. Table 1 summarizes the main results. A key conclusion is that long-range dependence in TCP traffic is primarily caused by the joint distribution of two TCP conversation parameters: the one-way number of packets per conversation and the conversation duration. <p> Extensions in both these directions are currently being investigated. An important parallel result in [35, 36] shows that the distributions of ON and OFF periods of different hosts over the Bellcore Ethernet are heavy tailed and have large variances (the "infinite variance syndrome"). The study in <ref> [30] </ref> shows that the tcplib package [13] generates similar VT plots as measured traffic. 12 5.2 Designed Experiments 5.2.1 Introduction In a designed experiment, the value of a set of response variables is studied as a function of the experimental parameters (factors), each set to some particular level.

Reference-contexts: To simplify subsequent processing, we translated the records into a format which tcpdump <ref> [34] </ref> could understand. We then employed tcpdump's powerful command syntax to select only packets that fit certain criteria.

Reference-contexts: Due to tractability reasons, we study a reduced system where (a) only a subset of traffic belonging to TCP conversations are studied, and (b) conversation inter-arrival correlations are not considered. Extensions in both these directions are currently being investigated.

Reference-contexts: These methods and their approximations are based on the spectral density of X t and properties of the MLEs are discussed by a number of authors <ref> [4, 10, 37] </ref>. One specific method that has been used extensively is Whittle's approximate MLE (e.g., see [23]). Most of the approximate MLEs are defined via quadratic forms which make them quite sensitive to deviations from normality. However, transformation of the data may sometimes alleviate these types of problems.
