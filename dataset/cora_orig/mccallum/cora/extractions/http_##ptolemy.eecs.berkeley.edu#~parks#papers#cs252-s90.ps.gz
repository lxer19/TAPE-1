Abstract: We compare the execution times of several benchmark programs in C on two processors, a TMS320C30 floating-point programmable DSP chip and a SPARC (in a Sun SPARCstation 1). We find that the SPARC is faster than the C30 for "untuned" C programs, and that tuning the C program and rewriting the dominant routine in assembly language speeds up performance on the C30 by 500% or more, but by Since their introduction in the late '70s, the use of programmable digital signal processors (DSPs) has increased vastly. These devices are specialized microcomputers designed for number-crunching and are typically used in applications with hard real-time constraints. A detailed discussion of programmable DSPs appears in [Lee88]. Most programmable DSPs are designed to make it possible to compute one tap of a finite impulse response (FIR) digital filter in one instruction cycle (there will also be a fixed overhead or pipeline delay to set things in motion). An FIR filter corresponds to the following equation: less than 10% on the SPARC.
