Title: From Copycat to Metacat: Developing a Self-Watching Framework for Analogy-Making

Abstract: This paper describes Metacat, an extension of the Copycat computer model of fluid concepts, high-level perception, and analogy-making. Copycat models the complex interplay between concepts and perception that gives rise to the flexible human ability to see apparently-dissimilar situations as being "the same". A key feature of the architecture is the emergence of statistically robust high-level behavior from the interactions of many small, low-level, nondeterministic processing agents. Metacat focuses on extending the architecture in a way that permits it to create rich representations of the analogies it makes. This involves incorporating a long-term memory into the architecture, along with a "self-watching" ability, so that the program can recognize, remember, and recall patterns that occur in its own processing as it solves analogy problems. Using this higher-order "meta-level" information, analogies can be compared and contrasted in an insightful way, allowing Metacat to understand and explain its answers in a way that Copycat cannot.
