Abstract: We study the problem of guaranteeing synchronous message deadlines in communication networks where the timed token medium access control protocol is employed. Synchronous capacity, defined as the maximum time for which a node can transmit its synchronous messages every time it receives the token, is a key parameter in the control of synchronous message transmission. To ensure the transmission of synchronous messages before their deadlines, synchronous capacities must be properly allocated to individual nodes. In this paper, we develop and analyze an optimal synchronous capacity allocation scheme. An optimal scheme can allocate the synchronous capacities in such a way that the synchronous message deadlines are guaranteed if there exists any allocation scheme that can do so. The optimality of the allocation scheme proposed in this paper is formally proved and the bounds for its Worst Case Achievable Utilization are derived.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, allocating excess amounts of synchronous capacities to the nodes could increase the token rotation time, which may also cause message deadlines to be missed. Thus, guaranteeing message deadlines is also dependent on the appropriate allocation of synchronous capacities to the nodes. In <ref> [3] </ref>, several heuristic allocation schemes were analyzed. The main objective of this paper is to design, analyze and evaluate an optimal synchronous capacity allocation scheme. We shall show that its capability in guaranteeing a set of synchronous messages is better than or equal to that of any other allocation scheme. <p> Because of this, we adopted the same methodology in our study of guaranteeing message deadlines. In <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, several heuristic synchronous capacity allocation schemes were analyzed and their Worst Case Achievable Utilizations were derived. It was shown that an inappropriate allocation of the synchronous capacities may result in a zero Worst Case Utilization. <p> That is, U (M ) = i=1 P i where n is the number of synchronous message streams. In the following discussion we assume that there is only one stream of synchronous messages on each node (i.e., m = n). In <ref> [3] </ref>, we showed that an arbitrary token ring network where a node may have zero, one, or more streams of synchronous messages can be transformed into a logically equivalent network with one stream of synchronous messages per node. <p> An allocation scheme is optimal if it can always guarantee a message set whenever there exists an allocation scheme that can do so. Some synchronous capacity allocation schemes Several allocation schemes have been studied in <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. They are as follows: 4 For example, according to the FDDI standard, the protocol dependent overheads include the token transmission time, asynchronous overrun, etc. Refer to [1] for details. 8 * Full length scheme. <p> Why, then, should the minimum amount of time for node i to transmit its synchronous messages be (q i 1) H i and not q i H i ? In <ref> [3] </ref>, it is formally proved that due to disturbances caused by asynchronous message transmission, the token may visit node i only q i 1 times in an 11 interval (t; t + q i T T RT ]. This can also be explained by Lemma 5.1. <p> of (14) i.e., max (0; min (r i ( P h=1;:::;n;h6=i H h t ); H i )), indicates the minimum available time for node i to transmit its synchronous messages in the remaining period, i.e., (t + q i T T RT; t + P i ]. * In <ref> [3] </ref>, a lower bound for X i was derived as follows: X i (q i 1) H i : (16) This lower bound was used in analyzing several heuristic allocation schemes mentioned earlier. <p> T T RT (P i q i T T RT ) H i : (19) That is, (q i + 1) T T RT P i H i : (20) This is the condition for the tightness of the lower bound of X ( ~ H) given by (14) in <ref> [3] </ref>). 6 An Optimal Synchronous Capacity Allocation Scheme In this section we develop an optimal allocation scheme. 12 By Theorem 5.1, the deadline constraint (8) can be restated as follows: for i = 1; 2; : : :; n, X i ( ~ H) = (q i 1) H i + <p> This is an important and challenging problem. In practice critical applications exist where message deadlines must be guaranteed. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work in this area has been reported, except for <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, 2. Synchronous capacity, defined as the maximum time a node can send its synchronous message when it captures the token, was shown to be critical in guaranteeing synchronous messages. An optimal synchronous capacity allocation scheme was developed.

Guaranteeing a message deadline implies transmitting the message before its deadline. <p> That is, in order to guarantee message deadlines in a token ring network, it is necessary to bound the time between two consecutive visits of the token to a node (called the token rotation time or the access time). The timed token protocol has this property. In <ref> [29, 54] </ref>, Johnson and Sevcik formally proved that when the network operates normally (i.e, in the absence of any failure), the token rotation time between two consecutive visits to a node is bounded by twice the Target Token Rotation Time (i.e., 2 T T RT ). <p> It is selected to be sufficiently small to support the response time requirements of the messages at all the nodes in the network. Since the time elapsed between two consecutive visits of the token at a node can be as much as 2 T T RT <ref> [29] </ref>, a node may not be able to transmit any message in this interval. Recall that the synchronous messages have their deadlines as the end of their periods.

Reference-contexts: A timing failure could lead to a catastrophe. Further, these systems are often distributed. This is not only because the applications themselves are often physically distributed, but also due to the potential that distributed systems have for providing good reliability, good resource sharing, and good extensibility <ref> [31, 59, 60, 70] </ref>. The key to success in using a distributed system for these applications is the timely execution of computation tasks that usually reside on different nodes and communicate with one another to accomplish a common goal.

Reference-contexts: The basic design requirements for a real-time communication protocol and for a real-time centralized scheduling algorithm are similar: both are constrained by time to allocate a serially used resource to a set of processes. Liu and Layland <ref> [35] </ref> addressed the issue of guaranteeing the deadlines of synchronous (i.e., periodic) tasks in a single CPU environment. They analyzed a fixed priority preemptive algorithm, called the rate monotonic algorithm, that assigns priorities in inverse proportion to task's periods. <p> Our work contributes to the state of the art in the theory of hard real-time scheduling and communication. The rate monotonic scheduling algorithm was shown to be optimal among fixed priority algorithms for scheduling periodic (synchronous) tasks <ref> [35] </ref>. Our work is the very first which offers optimal scheduling in an environment where priority arbitration is not supported and hence the rate monotonic algorithm cannot be used. Currently, we are working on multi-link ring networks where more than one link can connect two neighboring nodes.

Reference-contexts: That is, in order to guarantee message deadlines in a token ring network, it is necessary to bound the time between two consecutive visits of the token to a node (called the token rotation time or the access time). The timed token protocol has this property. In <ref> [29, 54] </ref>, Johnson and Sevcik formally proved that when the network operates normally (i.e, in the absence of any failure), the token rotation time between two consecutive visits to a node is bounded by twice the Target Token Rotation Time (i.e., 2 T T RT ). <p> An equation for the minimum value of the average token rotation time was also derived. Their results are under worst case assumptions and are close to the results derived by Johnson and Sevcik in <ref> [54] </ref> (under best case assumptions). The performance of the timed token ring depends on both the network load and the system parameters.
