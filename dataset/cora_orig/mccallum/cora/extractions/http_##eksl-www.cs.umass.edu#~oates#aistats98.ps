Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multi-Stream Dependency Detection (msdd) is an algorithm for finding rules that capture statistical dependencies in databases. Past applications of the algorithm include finding dependencies in multi-variate time series (Oates & Cohen 1996b), learning probabilistic planning operators <ref> (Oates & Cohen 1996a) </ref>, and acquiring rules for correlating and predicting asynchronous events (Oates, Jensen, & Cohen 1998). Previous work explored distributing msdd's search space over multiple machines as a mechanism for reducing its running time (Oates, Schmill, & Cohen 1997).

Reference-contexts: Previous work explored distributing msdd's search space over multiple machines as a mechanism for reducing its running time <ref> (Oates, Schmill, & Cohen 1997) </ref>. In this paper, we describe three methods for reducing the size of the search space that msdd considers and empirically evaluate their utility. The remainder of this section discusses the core msdd algorithm.
