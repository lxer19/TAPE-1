Abstract: VBR compressed video is known to exhibit significant, multiple-time-scale rate variability. A number of researchers have considered transmitting stored video from a server to a client using smoothing algorithms to reduce this rate variability. These algorithms exploit client buffering capabilities and determine a smooth rate transmission schedule, while ensuring that a client buffer neither overflows nor underflows. In this paper, we investigate how video smoothing impacts the statistical multiplexing gains available with such traffic and show that a significant amount of statistical multiplexing gain can be still be achieved. We then examine the implication of these results on network resource management and call admission control when transmitting smooth stored video using variable-bit-rate (VBR) service and statistical Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. Specifically, we present a call admission control scheme based on a Chernoff bound method that uses a simple, novel traffic model requiring only a few parameters. This scheme provides an easy and flexible mechanism for supporting multiple VBR service classes with different QoS requirements. We evaluate the efficacy of the call admission control scheme over a set of MPEG video traces.

Reference-contexts: Video, which is typically stored and transmitted in compressed format, can exhibit significant rate variability, often spanning multiple time scales and in some cases demonstrating self-similar behavior <ref> [9] </ref>. The highly bursty nature of VBR compressed video makes network call admission control and resource management a particularly difficult and complicated task.

Both the unsmoothed transmission schedule (a) as well as the smoothed schedules for client buffer sizes of 256 KB (b) and 1 MB (c) are shown. Figure 2 shows the corresponding histograms of the schedules, plotted with 100 bins (note the different scales in the axes). <p> This drastically altered marginal distribution of smoothed video streams has important consequences for traffic modeling.

In particular, the Pareto distribution is used to model the long heavy tail. <p> Extending the scheme to incorporate certain measurement-based features is another interesting topic of future research.

Reference-contexts: This drastically altered marginal distribution of smoothed video streams has important consequences for traffic modeling. For example, the traffic modeling techniques presented in <ref> [9, 15, 25] </ref> that characterize the heavy-tailed marginal distributions are not applicable to the smoothed video traces 1 . Different techniques are needed for modeling smoothed video traces. <p> For example, in [9] a hybrid model combining Gamma and Pareto distributions is proposed for characterizing the marginal distribution of the JPEG-encoded Starwars trace. In particular, the Pareto distribution is used to model the long heavy tail. In <ref> [15, 25] </ref>, the marginal distributions of I, P, B frames are characterized separately using the lognormal distribution. <p> Extending the scheme to incorporate certain measurement-based features is another interesting topic of future research.

Such video smoothing techniques can achieve significant reduction in rate variability. For example, over a set of MPEG video traces, the smoothing technique in <ref> [27] </ref> is shown to reduce the peak and standard deviation of the transmitted bit rate by approximately 70%-85%, when smoothed into a 1 MB client buffer. In this paper, we study several aspects of the problem of supporting stored video with variable-bit-rate (VBR) service and statistical QoS guarantees. <p> Because of the significant peak rate reduction, video smoothing can clearly improve the network utilization under CBR service <ref> [24, 20, 27] </ref>. In this paper, we explore the possibility of improving network utilization by exploiting statistical multiplexing gain with VBR service. <p> to ensure continuous playback at the client, the server must transmit the video stream in a manner that ensures the client buffer neither underflows nor overflows. 2 (a) Unsmoothed (b) Smoothed: 256KB (c) Smoothed: 1MB (a) Unsmoothed (b) Smoothed: 256KB (c) Smoothed: 1MB Various video smoothing algorithms have been developed <ref> [23, 24, 8, 20, 19, 27] </ref> that exploit client buffering capabilities to reduce the rate variability existing in VBR-compressed video, while ensuring that a client buffer neither overflows nor underflows. <p> In <ref> [27] </ref>, a smoothing algorithm is developed that achieves maximal reduction in rate variability for stored video, producing the smoothest possible server transmission schedules. The intuitive notion of smoothness is formalized using the concept of majorization [18], and the optimality of the smoothing algorithm is formally established. <p> The intuitive notion of smoothness is formalized using the concept of majorization [18], and the optimality of the smoothing algorithm is formally established. Among other things, the optimal smoothing algorithm in <ref> [27] </ref> produces a transmission schedule that has minimal peak rate and variance for a given client buffer size. <p> Two advantages are realized with minimal buffer allocation in the network. First, queueing delay jitter introduced by buffering within the network is greatly reduced. Therefore, less client buffer space needs to be set aside to accommodate the network jitter, thus achieving greater reduction in rate variability <ref> [27] </ref>. From the client's perspective, this also means reduced latency in playback. Second, minimal buffering at the network limits the effect of the autocorrelation structure of the user's traffic on the overall average loss rate. <p> Thus, there are significant statistical multiplexing gains to be exploited by VBR service when individual streams are smoothed, especially when client buffers are relatively small. In Appendix A, we show that under the independent arrival assumptions, the optimal smoothing algorithm developed in <ref> [27] </ref> is most likely to yield the smoothest aggregate stream in terms of the peak rate and variability. <p> Lo Presti for many insightful discussions and helpful comments. 19 A Appendix In this appendix, we are interested in answering the following question: Given n (not necessarily all different) video streams, for each video stream i, let S fl i be the transmission schedule produced by the optimal smoothing algorithm <ref> [27] </ref>, denoted by A fl , and S i be any feasible 10 transmission schedule produced by an arbitrary smoothing algorithm, denoted by A. <p> We define its marginal distribution F i (x) in exactly the same manner. Let v fl i and v i be two random variables with the distributions F fl i and F i respectively. We claim that v fl i icx v i . In <ref> [27] </ref>, it is established that S fl i is majorized 11 by S i , i = 1; : : : ; n,. Hence we have E [h (v fl i )] = t=1 i (t)) t=1 i (t)) = E [h (v i )], for any convex function h. <p> independent, and v i ; i = 1; 2; : : : ; n are independent, then P n i icx i=1 v i . 10 By a feasible transmission schedule, we mean a transmission schedule according to which the server never overflows nor underflows the client buffer. 11 See <ref> [27] </ref> for the definition of majorization and its application to video smoothing. 20 The above theorem gives a precise mathematical formulation of the question posed in the beginning of this appendix.

Reference-contexts: The method is evaluated using video-conferencing traces. A DAR (1) model is employed to specify the source traffic. However, due to its high burstiness, a DAR (1) model is not appropriate for MPEG compressed video trace. A histogram-based call admission control scheme is proposed in <ref> [28] </ref>, and the loss probability of the aggregate traffic at a network switch is computed using convolution, incurring formidable computational costs when the number of sources is large.

Reference-contexts: The effectiveness of statistical multiplexing gain for such VBR traffic is then studied. Recently, several new network services have been proposed which rely on the implicit exploitation of statistical multiplexing gain by adding a renegotiation feature to CBR service [10], and to VBR service with deterministic QoS guarantees <ref> [29] </ref>. In [10], the entire rate change profile of a renegotiated CBR (RCBR) stream is characterized by a Markovian model and the Chernoff bound method is used for call admission control to limit the probability of service failure.

The Chernoff bound is a well-known method that has been applied to call admission control with statistical QoS <ref> [11, 6, 10, 30] </ref>. In [6], a combination of effective bandwidths and the Chernoff bound (called the Chernoff-Dominant Eigenvalue method) is proposed for call admission control at a network multiplexer with shared buffers. The method is evaluated using video-conferencing traces.
