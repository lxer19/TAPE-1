Abstract: We evaluate MUSIC, LMS, and the Goertzel algorithms for dual-tone multiple-frequency estimation. We rate their computational requirements,estimation errors, and their compliance with the CCITT Q.23 and Q.24 standards through MATLAB simulations and real-time implementations on the ADSP-2101 and Motorola 56001 processors.

Reference-contexts: The Goertzel algorithm computes the kth DFT coefficient of the input signal x [n] using a second-order filter s k [n] = x [n] + 2 cos ( N y k [n] = s k [n] W k where s k [2] = s k <ref> [1] </ref> = 0. The kth DFT coefficient is produced after the filter has processed N samples: X [k] = y k [n]j n=N . The key in an implementation is to run s k [n] for N samples and then evaluate y k [N ]. <p> From the orthogonality of the signal and noise subspaces, finding the peaks in the estimator function J (!) = [a (!)] H U v U H (12) for various ! values yields the strongest frequencies <ref> [1] </ref>, where a (!) refers to the columns of A. MUSIC assumes that the number of samples M and the number of frequencies N are known.

Reference-contexts: Since DTMF signals do not have second harmonics, we could compute another 8 DFT coefficients to compute the second harmonics to detect the presence of speech <ref> [3] </ref>. The Goertzel algorithm computes the kth DFT coefficient of the input signal x [n] using a second-order filter s k [n] = x [n] + 2 cos ( N y k [n] = s k [n] W k where s k [2] = s k [1] = 0. <p> We used a conventional value of N = 205 <ref> [3, 10] </ref> because it is roughly half of 400 samples. Decision logic can be added to give a valid DTMF signal if the same two DTMF tones are detected in a row to add robustness against noise. Table 1: Chosen k values to minimize the error in k.

MATLAB SIMULATIONS MATLAB simulations indicate that the Goertzel algorithm does not meet standard 2 (b), and that the NDFE algorithm is very fast compared to the other two but gives large estimation errors. MUSIC meets the standards on the estimation error because it is a high-resolution technique <ref> [5] </ref>. Execution times in MATLAB are: Goertzel 11.8 s, NDFET 2.1 s, and MUSIC 3.2 s. MATLAB, however, is optimized for floating-point matrix-vector calculations, and it is not necessarily a good indicator of execution times on fixed-point DSP processors. VII.

Reference-contexts: VIII. MOTOROLA 56001 IMPLEMENTATION We add decision logic to detect valid DTMF signals and generate DTMF decoders for the Motorola 56001 processor (24-bit, 40 MHz) using the Ptolemy software environment <ref> [6] </ref>. Ptolemy is a freely distributable, extensible, graphical block diagram environment that interfaces with compilers, assemblers, hardware synthesis tools, and other external programs. Goertzel and NDFET decoders are included in Ptolemy 0.6, due for release on April 15, 1996, via the ftp site ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu.

GOERTZEL ALGORITHM The Goertzel algorithm is more efficient than the Fast Fourier Transform in computing an N -point DFT if less than 2 log 2 N DFT coefficients are required <ref> [9] </ref>. In DTMF detection, we only need 8 of, for example, 205 DFT coefficients to detect the first harmonics of the 8 possible tones, and then apply decision logic to choose the strongest touch tone.

Reference-contexts: MUSIC assumes that the number of samples M and the number of frequencies N are known. The efficiency of MUSIC is the ratio of the theoretical smallest variance, given by the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) <ref> [11] </ref>, to the variance of the MUSIC estimator: eff = var CRLB ( ! i ) =var MUSIC ( ! i ) (13) The efficiency does not depend on the total number of samples, m, (Figure 1) but does depend on M (Figure 2).

Reference-contexts: MUSIC Algorithm We implemented MUSIC in C and then cross-compiled it to assembly.

R y is estimated by 1 m X y [n]y H [n] + y Bfl [n]y BT [n] (14) where B denotes the backward vector operation, with M = 8 and m = 200.

Reference-contexts: Like the ADSP implementation, processing is performed on blocks of 205 samples for Goertzel and 300 for the NDFET. We match the intensive signal processing computa-tions and the accompanying decision logic to the Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) model of computation <ref> [13] </ref> in Ptolemy. A valid SDF subsystem always has a static implementation, i.e., one that does not require any run-time scheduling. This holds true whether we ultimately generate an implementation for a DSP processor, for multiple processors, as C code, or as a VLSI chip.
