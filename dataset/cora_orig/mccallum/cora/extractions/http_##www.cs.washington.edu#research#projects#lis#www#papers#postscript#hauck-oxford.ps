Abstract: Existing FPGA architectures can be classified along two dimensions: reprogrammable vs. onetime programmable and general-purpose vs. domain specific. The most challenging class of FPGA architectures to design is the reprogrammable, general-purpose FPGA, of which Xilinx is the most well-known example. In this paper we describe Triptych, a new FPGA architecture that addresses two problems of current reprogrammable FPGAs: the large delays incurred in composing large functions and the strict division between routing and logic resources. Our studies indicate that Triptych is more area-efficient than current architectures and has comparable delay characteristics for a large range of circuits that include both data-path elements and control logic.

Reference-contexts: The logic cells account for 10-15% of the chip area and 750,000 bits are required to program a typical chip of 1200 cells <ref> (Actel 1991) </ref>. The number of routing tracks limits the total number of cells that can be placed with reasonable routability on a single chip. A more recent entry in the FPGA arena is the Apple Labyrinth architecture (Furtek 1990).

Reference-contexts: FPGAs can be programmed using a reprogrammable memory-based scheme or a onetime programmable fuse technology. Xilinx is the most well-known example of a reprogrammable FPGA <ref> (Carter 1986) </ref>. It has logic blocks that can perform arbitrary functions of five inputs. The routing resources are arranged in an orthogonal grid around the function blocks and occupy approximately 90% of the chip area.
