Abstract: Here are the key points you should remember from our discussion of automata theory on Thursday. 2. Given a regular expression r, we can construct an *-NFA M such that L(M ) = L(r) using Thomp-son's construction; we can convert M into a DFA N such that L(M) = L(N ) using subset construc tion. We abstracted the lexing problem as the question of determining whether a string s belongs to a regular language L. However, this does not capture all the subtleties of lexing. First, we don't really have the string s. Rather, we have a string t, and we need to determine the longest prefix s of t that is in L. Then we delete s from t and start over again. Second, we don't just accept strings, but we must also return a token identifying what was accepted. Finally, we need to do something reasonable when we encounter a lexical error, i.e., no prefix of t matches in L.
