Reference-contexts: ATM is essentially a packet-switching technology that switches small fixed-sized packets called cells. This approach allows for efficient multiplexing as well as the support of different QoS guarantees for different traffic types. The ATM service model includes the following five service classes <ref> [1, 2] </ref>: 1.1. Background: Integrated Services 6 * Constant Bit Rate (CBR): Similar to the synchronous schemes of traditional telephony networks, the CBR service class makes available a fixed quantity of bandwidth for each connection. <p> Of the five ATM service classes, only UBR does not employ admission control mechanisms. Both CBR and rt-VBR are distinguished as real-time service classes, while the remaining three service classes are for non-real-time applications <ref> [1] </ref>. 1.2. Network Support for Bounded-Delay Services 7 1.1.3 Common Ground: Bounded-Delay Services For multimedia applications, delay is regarded as the most important QoS parameter [22, 28]. <p> The sender contacts admission control mechanisms 2 Admission control mechanisms and traffic policing mechanisms are referred to as Connection Admission Control (CAC) and Usage Parameter Control (UPC), respectively, in the ATM community <ref> [1] </ref>. 1.2. Network Support for Bounded-Delay Services 9 before establishing the connection, and all traffic submitted to the network is monitored by traffic policing mechanisms. Admission control and traffic policing mechanisms restrict the number of connections and the traffic on those connections, thereby limiting the network utilization. <p> The peak rate model can be easily enforced by a packet spacing mechanism that ensures a minimum interarrival time between consecutive packets <ref> [1, 12, 101] </ref>. Note that the peak-rate model specifies CBR traffic and will overestimate resource requirements of a VBR source. 3.1.2 (r; T )-model The (r; T )-model describes its traffic with a rate parameter r and a framing interval T [41]. <p> This model enforces a rate while allowing some burstiness up to . Efficient implementations of the leaky bucket mechanism are discussed in <ref> [1, 100] </ref>. 1 In the ATM community, a leaky bucket mechanism is referred to as the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA) [1]. 3.1. <p> This model enforces a rate while allowing some burstiness up to . Efficient implementations of the leaky bucket mechanism are discussed in [1, 100]. 1 In the ATM community, a leaky bucket mechanism is referred to as the Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA) <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.1. Traffic Characterization 28 We use B fl to denote the traffic constraint function for the (; )-model, where B fl is obtained straightforwardly as follows: B fl (t) = + t for all t 0 (3.3) In Figure 3.4 we illustrate the traffic constraint function B fl . <p> For these reasons, the networking community has focused primarily on characterizations that can be policed by leaky bucket mechanisms, that is, the (; ) and (~; ~) traffic models. We note that both the Internet community [13] and the ATM community <ref> [1, 2] </ref> specify traffic characterizations that comply with the (~; ~)-model. <p> For example, up to a dozen leaky buckets are needed to accurately characterize MPEG-I video streams [103]. Since practical considerations limit the number of available leaky buckets to a small value, e.g., the limit is two for ATM connections <ref> [1] </ref>, methods are needed that yield an accurate VBR traffic characterization, yet, with only a small number of leaky buckets. In this chapter, we present a solution to the problem of constructing an accurate traffic characterization for stored VBR video with few leaky buckets.

In RPQ + , the range of all laxities is partitioned into fixed-sized "bins," and each FIFO queue has a fixed laxity range of size ; for example, FIFO 1 holds packets with laxities in the range [0; ], FIFO 2 holds packets with laxities <ref> [; 2] </ref>, and a general FIFO p holds packets with laxities [(p 1); p]. Thus, an RPQ + scheduler requires D= FIFO queues to support a maximum delay bound of D.

Reference-contexts: To be used in the delay bound test of a bounded-delay service, a characterization must specify the maximum traffic on a connection. In this section we review six such traffic models which have been considered for use in bounded-delay services: the peak-rate model <ref> [3] </ref>, the (; )-model [23], the (~; ~)- model [24, 103], the (r; T )-model [41], the (X min ; X ave ; I ; s max )-model [29, 31], and the D-BIND model [55, 58].

Reference-contexts: On a per-port or per-connection basis, the output buffer memory consists of either a single shared memory pool or physically separate memory. Most ATM switches use output buffers, and the majority of these are shared-memory buffers <ref> [4, 11, 36] </ref>. We assume that RPQ + operates in switches that have shared-memory output buffers.

Reference-contexts: Many approaches to traffic characterization do not provide a worst-case bound on the traffic arrivals of a connection and therefore cannot be employed in a bounded-delay service that provides worst-case guarantees <ref> [5, 34, 37, 45, 47, 53, 79] </ref>. Similarly, many packet schedulers have been proposed that are 1.3. Our Approach to Characterization and Scheduling 11 optimized for criteria other than guaranteeing a bounded delay, e.g., fairness in allocating "spare bandwidth" and isolation of connections [81, 82, 83, 115, 116]. <p> Regarding video traffic characterization, many approaches characterize traffic sources using sophisticated stochastic models such as Markov-modulated [47], autoregressive [48, 50, 59], self-similar <ref> [5, 37] </ref>, TES [50, 79], and S-BIND [60, 113]. These approaches do not do not provide a worst-case bound on traffic arrivals and therefore cannot be used as a traffic characterization as described in Chapter 2.1.

Reference-contexts: We then review studies that evaluate and compare the tradeoffs involved with each traffic model. 3.1.1 Peak-rate model The peak-rate model is the simplest and most widely used of all traffic models <ref> [6] </ref>. For this model, two parameters are used to describe traffic on a connection: a minimum interarrival time X min and the maximum transmission time s max of any packet. The maximum traffic for a connection that conforms to the peak-rate model is given by the following traffic 3.1.

Reference-contexts: We note that two alternative intermediate services have been recently proposed in the Internet community: the committed rate service that guarantees a minimum rate to admitted connections without providing explicit delay guarantees <ref> [7] </ref>, and the controlled load service that limits the number of connections to ensure that all connections receive the same best-effort service that they would receive from a 1.1.

Reference-contexts: However, packets may be delayed or dropped arbitrarily. Intermediate services have been investigated that provide QoS guarantees between these two extremes, trading off QoS and network utilization. Among these service types are (i) statistical services that provide probabilistic bounds on the percentage of packets delivered within the QoS constraints <ref> [8, 27, 31, 54, 60, 113] </ref>, (ii) services with bounded degradation that allow a client to specify a degradation of service commitments for a fixed portion of traffic [71], and (iii) predictive services that estimate the QoS of a connection based on measurements of current resource usage [13, 20, 51]. <p> Both the Internet and ATM service models include a service class that supports deterministic guarantees on maximum delay for connections, which we refer to as a bounded-delay service. Other protocol architectures that include a bounded-delay service are the Tenet scheme <ref> [8] </ref>, the QoS Architecture (QoS-A) [16], and MAGNET II [66]. Thus, it is widely agreed upon that a bounded-delay service is essential to QoS networks. <p> There are several approaches to partitioning the end-to-end delay bound D i into local delay bounds <ref> [8, 14, 94] </ref>. When we consider connections at a single switch, we drop the subscript j and denote that delay bound for connection i by d i .

Reference-contexts: Thus, a WFQ scheduler will never fall behind a corresponding GPS scheduler by more than a single packet transmission time. Variants of WFQ include the Worst-case Fair Weighted Fair Queueing (WF 2 Q) and Self-Clocked Fair Queueing (SCFQ) schedulers <ref> [9, 42] </ref>. <p> Bennett and Zhang show in <ref> [9] </ref> that a packet from connection i departing a GPS scheduler at time t will depart a WF 2 Q scheduler no later than time t + s max and no earlier than time t g i s max . <p> While a SCFQ scheduler is the simplest of all GPS approximation schedulers described here, it has the worst fairness properties as well <ref> [9, 43] </ref>. Other packet schedulers that approximate WFQ include Deficit Round Robin (DRR) [96], Carry-Over Round Robin (CORR) [91], and Frame-based Fair Queueing (FFQ) [98]. The two round-robin schedulers are work-conserving and allocate unused bandwidth to back 3.2.

Reference-contexts: Following, in Subsections 3.2 and 3.3, we present and evaluate the new solution approach to VBR video characterization. 4.2.1 The Empirical Envelope E fl The tightest traffic constraint function for a given traffic source is its empirical envelope, denoted by E fl <ref> [17, 103] </ref>. The empirical envelope E fl of a video sequence is optimal in the sense that, for any subadditive traffic constraint function A fl that satisfies equation (2.1), A fl (t) E fl (t) for all t. The empirical envelope E fl is given by the following equation [17, 103]: <p> fl <ref> [17, 103] </ref>. The empirical envelope E fl of a video sequence is optimal in the sense that, for any subadditive traffic constraint function A fl that satisfies equation (2.1), A fl (t) E fl (t) for all t. The empirical envelope E fl is given by the following equation [17, 103]: E fl (t) = sup A [t; t + t] 8t 0 (4.3) Note from equation (4.3) that E fl is subadditive. The following method presented in [103] obtains the empirical envelope of a given video sequence consisting of N frames with fixed inter-frame time r. <p> We use the so-called empirical envelope of a video sequence to characterize its traffic, where the empirical envelope E fl of a sequence with traffic A is given by <ref> [17, 103] </ref>: E fl (t) = sup A [t; t + t] 8t 0 (5.29) The empirical envelope is the tightest traffic characterization available for a video sequence and, when used with admission control, will result in the admission of a maximal number of connections.

Reference-contexts: Many schemes select parameters and according to either network resource availability or the relative importance of bandwidth and buffer space. Pancha and El Zarki [80] choose parameters by fixing the burstiness parameter according to available buffer space, while the choice of (; ) in <ref> [18] </ref> depends on the relative availability of unallocated bandwidth and buffer space. An approach discussed by Guillemin et. al. in [46] assigns relative importance parameters ff and fi to buffer space and bandwidth, respectively; the pair (; ) is selected to minimize the quantity ff fi .

Reference-contexts: In this dissertation, we consider the design of traffic characterization and packet scheduling methods that are intended explicitly for bounded-delay services <ref> [23, 31, 74, 82] </ref>. Our goal is to design methods that can be implemented straightforwardly and result in a high network utilization. 1.3 Our Approach to Characterization and Scheduling The approach of this work is motivated by a study in [103] by Wrege, Knightly, Zhang, and Liebeherr. <p> Then, a worst-case characterization of the traffic A is given by a traffic constraint function A fl which provides an upper bound on A. A traffic constraint function A fl should satisfy two important properties, namely time-invariance and subadditivity <ref> [23, 74] </ref>. <p> A traffic constraint function A fl should satisfy two important properties, namely time-invariance and subadditivity [23, 74]. A function A fl provides a time-invariant bound for A if for all times t 0 and t 0 the following holds <ref> [23] </ref>: A [t; t + t] A fl (t) (2.1) Since a time-invariant traffic constraint function A fl bounds the maximum traffic over any time interval of length t, the delay-bound tests can be made independent of the starting time of a connection. <p> Finally, we wish to add that admission control mechanisms for QoS networks generally assume that traffic constraint functions are both time-invariant and subadditive <ref> [23, 74, 82] </ref>. In this 2.1. Traffic Characterization 17 dissertation, we call a traffic constraint function A fl for A viable for a deterministic service if it satisfies both equations (2.1) and (2.2). <p> Practical traffic characterizations are obtained from a parameterized traffic model which in turn expresses the maximum traffic admitted by some traffic policing mechanism. For example, consider the (; ) traffic model <ref> [23] </ref> which describes the worst-case traffic admitted by a leaky bucket mechanism with a burstiness parameter and a rate parameter . <p> We denote the traffic constraint function that provides a bound on the maximum traffic conforming to the (; )-model by B fl , where B fl is given by the following linear constraint <ref> [23] </ref>: B fl (t) = + t for all t 0 (2.3) constraint function B fl . Note that B fl is an upper bound on A. <p> In this chapter we review approaches to traffic characterization and packet scheduling suitable for use in networks with a bounded-delay service. In Section 3.1 we review a 23 3.1. Traffic Characterization 24 number of deterministic traffic models <ref> [23, 24, 31, 41, 55, 103] </ref>. We consider both the traffic constraint function that specifies the maximum traffic conforming to each model as well as available traffic policing mechanisms for enforcement. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each traffic characterization method. <p> To be used in the delay bound test of a bounded-delay service, a characterization must specify the maximum traffic on a connection. In this section we review six such traffic models which have been considered for use in bounded-delay services: the peak-rate model [3], the (; )-model <ref> [23] </ref>, the (~; ~)- model [24, 103], the (r; T )-model [41], the (X min ; X ave ; I ; s max )-model [29, 31], and the D-BIND model [55, 58]. <p> Observe also in Figure 3.2 that the worst-case burst of size 2rT is twice as large as the actual burst rT of traffic on the connection. 3.1. Traffic Characterization 27 3.1.3 (; )-model The (; )-model describes its traffic with a burst parameter and a rate parameter <ref> [23] </ref>. The traffic on a connection over any time interval of length t is limited to + t. The (; )- model is the traffic model for the well-known leaky bucket policing mechanism 1 which is implemented as follows [100]. <p> Due to its simplicity which enables packet scheduling at very high data rates, SP schedulers are attractive for bounded delay services. Using a fluid flow traffic specification, necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions for SP-schedulers are presented in <ref> [23] </ref>. However, the conditions are not exact for more realistic discrete traffic scenarios. For a particular discrete traffic specification [31], Zhang and Ferrari [111], and Zhang [108] have derived several sufficient schedulability conditions. <p> Unfortunately, the number of leaky buckets available to monitor a connec 3 The exact delay bound test for FCFS multiplexers is given by d P j (t) t + s for all t 0 <ref> [23] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, overhead costs of implementing VC are much higher than for the framing schemes since packets must be sorted according to their virtual finishing times. A packet scheduler similar to VC that has recently received much attention is Weighted-Fair-Queueing (WFQ) <ref> [25] </ref>. Like VC, WFQ statistically multiplexes packets according to virtual finishing times, but WFQ emulates a fluid-flow processor-sharing system rather than TDM. <p> To address this problem, packetized versions of GPS have been considered. WFQ approximates GPS in the same way that VC approximates TDM: packets are assigned virtual finishing times corresponding with the time they would complete transmission in a GPS system <ref> [25, 82] </ref>. Each connection is assigned a service share, and the kth packet on connection i that has transmission time s and arrival time t is assigned the following virtual finishing time: F k i maxft; F k1 i g + P i 3.2.

However, it was shown in [103] that the (~; ~)-model which employs multiple leaky bucket mechanisms can accurately characterize VBR video.

Among these service types are (i) statistical services that provide probabilistic bounds on the percentage of packets delivered within the QoS constraints <ref> [8, 27, 31, 54, 60, 113] </ref>, (ii) services with bounded degradation that allow a client to specify a degradation of service commitments for a fixed portion of traffic [71], and (iii) predictive services that estimate the QoS of a connection based on measurements of current resource usage [13, 20, 51]. <p> A client desiring a new connection submits to the network (1) a traffic characterization that specifies the maximum traffic on the connection and (2) a delay bound that specifies the maximum end-to-end delay to be experienced by any packet on the connection <ref> [31] </ref>. After a route is determined for the prospective connection, the network employs admission control mechanisms to check whether sufficient bandwidth and buffer space is available along the connection path to support the traffic specified by the traffic characterization at its desired delay guarantee. <p> In this dissertation, we consider the design of traffic characterization and packet scheduling methods that are intended explicitly for bounded-delay services <ref> [23, 31, 74, 82] </ref>. Our goal is to design methods that can be implemented straightforwardly and result in a high network utilization. 1.3 Our Approach to Characterization and Scheduling The approach of this work is motivated by a study in [103] by Wrege, Knightly, Zhang, and Liebeherr. <p> In particular, they used the so-called empirical envelope of a traffic source for traffic characterization and the Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) packet scheduling discipline <ref> [31] </ref> with delay bound tests developed in [74]. They showed that these components result in maximal network utilization, and they demonstrated empirically that a reasonable utilization (i.e., around 40%) can be obtained when supporting VBR video traffic sources with delay bounds on the order of 10-50 milliseconds. <p> In this chapter we review approaches to traffic characterization and packet scheduling suitable for use in networks with a bounded-delay service. In Section 3.1 we review a 23 3.1. Traffic Characterization 24 number of deterministic traffic models <ref> [23, 24, 31, 41, 55, 103] </ref>. We consider both the traffic constraint function that specifies the maximum traffic conforming to each model as well as available traffic policing mechanisms for enforcement. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each traffic characterization method. <p> In this section we review six such traffic models which have been considered for use in bounded-delay services: the peak-rate model [3], the (; )-model [23], the (~; ~)- model [24, 103], the (r; T )-model [41], the (X min ; X ave ; I ; s max )-model <ref> [29, 31] </ref>, and the D-BIND model [55, 58]. We formulate the traffic constraint function A fl for each traffic model and also discuss traffic policing mechanisms used for enforcement [26, 86, 87]. <p> ) pairs, where the first of the two pairs is set such that 1 = 0 and 1 is equal to the peak traffic rate [2]. 3.1.5 (X min ; X ave ; I; s max )-model In the (X min ; X ave ; I ; s max )-model <ref> [29, 31] </ref>, X min is the minimum packet interarrival time, X ave is the maximum average packet interarrival time over any time interval of length I , and s max is the maximum packet transmission time. <p> We would like to note, however, that the notion of combining rate-controlling mechanisms with packet schedulers is not unique to VC; the addition of rate-controlling mechanisms has enabled other disciplines to provide delay and delay jitter guarantees <ref> [31, 102, 108, 111] </ref>. A drawback of VC scheduling is that a connection may be penalized for utilizing spare bandwidth that it received when other connections were idle [82, 116]. <p> Frame-based Fair Queueing (FFQ) [98] is a tunable scheduling discipline that provides a tradeoff between the implementation simplicity of VC and the fairness properties of WFQ. 3.2.2 Delay-based Scheduling Disciplines In this section we review two delay-based scheduling disciplines that have been previously considered for bounded-delay services: Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) <ref> [31, 102] </ref> and Static-Priority [111]. Similar to our discussion of the rate-based schedulers, we describe the operations of the schedulers. <p> Packet Scheduling and Delay Bound Tests 42 model in [38] and for more general traffic characterizations in [74]. The high achievable network utilization makes EDF an excellent candidate for bounded-delay services. Ferrari and Verma presented sufficient schedulability conditions for EDF scheduling for a bounded delay service in <ref> [31] </ref>. Using a traffic specification which neglects the burstiness of network traffic, Zheng and Shin have derived necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions [118]. Liebeherr et. al. present necessary and sufficient conditions for schedulability in an EDF scheduler in [74] for the general class of traffic characterizations described in Section 2.1. <p> Using a fluid flow traffic specification, necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions for SP-schedulers are presented in [23]. However, the conditions are not exact for more realistic discrete traffic scenarios. For a particular discrete traffic specification <ref> [31] </ref>, Zhang and Ferrari [111], and Zhang [108] have derived several sufficient schedulability conditions. <p> In this chapter, we consider the design of packet schedulers appropriate for use in networks with a bounded-delay service.

The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. After discussing related work in Section 5.1, we describe the RPQ + scheduler in Section 5.2. In Section 5.3 we discuss a shared-memory implementation of RPQ + , and we compare the operational overhead of 5.1.

Reference-contexts: With regard to achievable network utilization, EDF is the a better choice than any of the rate-based disciplines for a number of reasons. First, recall that EDF is the optimal packet scheduler for a single network switch; also, in <ref> [39] </ref> it is shown that EDF can achieve a utilization higher than both WFQ and VC in a network environment over multiple switches. <p> While the focus of our research is on finding a traffic characterization for VBR video traffic, other studies exist that explore the benefits of reducing the burstiness of VBR traffic through either (1) shaping the traffic by spacing packets before submitting them to the network <ref> [39, 56, 62] </ref> or (2) sending packets early with respect to their playback time at the receiving application via workahead smoothing [78, 88, 92]. <p> In this chapter, we consider the design of packet schedulers appropriate for use in networks with a bounded-delay service.

We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each traffic characterization method. <p> In this section we review six such traffic models which have been considered for use in bounded-delay services: the peak-rate model [3], the (; )-model [23], the (~; ~)- model [24, 103], the (r; T )-model <ref> [41] </ref>, the (X min ; X ave ; I ; s max )-model [29, 31], and the D-BIND model [55, 58]. We formulate the traffic constraint function A fl for each traffic model and also discuss traffic policing mechanisms used for enforcement [26, 86, 87]. <p> Note that the peak-rate model specifies CBR traffic and will overestimate resource requirements of a VBR source. 3.1.2 (r; T )-model The (r; T )-model describes its traffic with a rate parameter r and a framing interval T <ref> [41] </ref>. Time is partitioned into frames of length T , and the maximum traffic on a connection during any frame is limited to rT bits. Thus, the (r; T )-model enforces an average rate r while allowing for moderate bursts. <p> The Stop-and-Go <ref> [41] </ref>, Hierarchical-Round-Robin (HRR) [52], and Virtual Clock (VC) [116] schedulers approximate TDM systems which isolate connections from one another, guaranteeing a fixed share of available bandwidth to each connection. <p> The transmission order of packets in a departing frame is arbitrary. Delay and delay jitter guarantees for Stop-and-Go are derived for connections with traffic that conforms to the (r; T )-model: both the delay and delay jitter for all packets are bounded by 2T <ref> [41] </ref>. The HRR scheduler can be viewed as an extension of a simple round robin server. <p> Also, we note that the bandwidth allocation is coupled with the delay guarantee for both packet schedulers. To 3.2. Packet Scheduling and Delay Bound Tests 38 address this problem, the schemes described in <ref> [41, 52] </ref> propose a hierarchical structure with multiple frame lengths that all divide the frame size T , but coupling still persists [110]. 3.2.1.2 Virtual Clock (VC) The VC scheduler statistically multiplexes packets in an order that approximates a TDM system. <p> In this chapter, we consider the design of packet schedulers appropriate for use in networks with a bounded-delay service. Many packet schedulers have been considered for use in bounded-delay services <ref> [31, 32, 41, 52, 111] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a WFQ scheduler will never fall behind a corresponding GPS scheduler by more than a single packet transmission time. Variants of WFQ include the Worst-case Fair Weighted Fair Queueing (WF 2 Q) and Self-Clocked Fair Queueing (SCFQ) schedulers <ref> [9, 42] </ref>. <p> Thus, WF 2 Q has stronger fairness properties than WFQ at the expense of increased implementation complexity. In contrast to WF 2 Q, the SCFQ scheduler proposed by Golestani in <ref> [42] </ref> sacrifices fairness for significantly reduced implementation complexity. In real time, both WFQ and WF 2 Q must simulate a GPS scheduler to calculate a precise sorting criteria, and this task is computationally expensive.

Reference-contexts: In a network that employs renegotiation, traffic characterizations are occasionally modified to exploit long-term traffic variations of the VBR video traffic source, possibly leading to increased network utilization <ref> [19, 44, 114] </ref>. Since a renegotiation scheme requires multiple traffic characterizations for a single connection, a fast traffic characterization scheme such as the one described in this chapter can be used to renegotiate traffic parameters. <p> Most renegotiation schemes that have been proposed attempt to renegotiate the traffic characterization of a connection whenever its long-term rate changes significantly <ref> [19, 44, 114] </ref>. Chong et. al. address the problem of predicting the rate changes of a live video source [19]. They consider both a recursive least-square method and an artificial neural network approach for the prediction. <p> Chong et. al. address the problem of predicting the rate changes of a live video source [19].

Reference-contexts: Pancha and El Zarki [80] choose parameters by fixing the burstiness parameter according to available buffer space, while the choice of (; ) in [18] depends on the relative availability of unallocated bandwidth and buffer space.

Also, all of these approaches consider the selection of parameters for only a single leaky bucket mechanism. Guillemin et. al. present two heuristic algorithms in <ref> [46] </ref> that select a leaky bucket pair (; ) to approximate an "ideal" probabilistic traffic characterization, the so-called time * quantile function M * (t) associated with a source. <p> Assuming that N t is a random variable specifying the number of packets generated over any interval of length t, a function M * (t) is used to specify with probability 1 * the maximum traffic arrivals n in any interval of length t <ref> [46, 90] </ref>: M * (t) = inf fn; P rfN t ng *g (4.2) The quantity M * (t)=t specifies the rate of the video sequence over multiple time scales t.

The idea of scheduling packets in bursts is expanded to other scheduling disciplines in <ref> [64] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Both the Internet and ATM service models include a service class that supports deterministic guarantees on maximum delay for connections, which we refer to as a bounded-delay service. Other protocol architectures that include a bounded-delay service are the Tenet scheme [8], the QoS Architecture (QoS-A) [16], and MAGNET II <ref> [66] </ref>. Thus, it is widely agreed upon that a bounded-delay service is essential to QoS networks.

Reference-contexts: In this dissertation, we consider the design of traffic characterization and packet scheduling methods that are intended explicitly for bounded-delay services <ref> [23, 31, 74, 82] </ref>. Our goal is to design methods that can be implemented straightforwardly and result in a high network utilization. 1.3 Our Approach to Characterization and Scheduling The approach of this work is motivated by a study in [103] by Wrege, Knightly, Zhang, and Liebeherr. <p> In particular, they used the so-called empirical envelope of a traffic source for traffic characterization and the Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) packet scheduling discipline [31] with delay bound tests developed in <ref> [74] </ref>. They showed that these components result in maximal network utilization, and they demonstrated empirically that a reasonable utilization (i.e., around 40%) can be obtained when supporting VBR video traffic sources with delay bounds on the order of 10-50 milliseconds. <p> Then, a worst-case characterization of the traffic A is given by a traffic constraint function A fl which provides an upper bound on A. A traffic constraint function A fl should satisfy two important properties, namely time-invariance and subadditivity <ref> [23, 74] </ref>. <p> Finally, we wish to add that admission control mechanisms for QoS networks generally assume that traffic constraint functions are both time-invariant and subadditive <ref> [23, 74, 82] </ref>. In this 2.1. Traffic Characterization 17 dissertation, we call a traffic constraint function A fl for A viable for a deterministic service if it satisfies both equations (2.1) and (2.2). <p> The performance of a packet scheduler in providing bounded delay services can be determined by the degree to which it satisfies the following requirements <ref> [74] </ref>: * Efficiency: A high utilization of network resources such as link bandwidth can only be achieved if the packet schedulers can support bounded delays for a large number of connections. * Flexibility: A packet scheduler must be sufficiently flexible to satisfy a diverse set of delay requirements. <p> This optimality was demonstrated in a network setting for traffic conforming to the (; )- 3.2. Packet Scheduling and Delay Bound Tests 42 model in [38] and for more general traffic characterizations in <ref> [74] </ref>. The high achievable network utilization makes EDF an excellent candidate for bounded-delay services. Ferrari and Verma presented sufficient schedulability conditions for EDF scheduling for a bounded delay service in [31]. <p> Using a traffic specification which neglects the burstiness of network traffic, Zheng and Shin have derived necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions [118]. Liebeherr et. al. present necessary and sufficient conditions for schedulability in an EDF scheduler in <ref> [74] </ref> for the general class of traffic characterizations described in Section 2.1. We assume without loss of generality that connections are ordered so that i &lt; j whenever d i &lt; d j . Then the schedulability conditions are given as follows for a set of connections C [74]: Theorem 3.1 <p> scheduler in <ref> [74] </ref> for the general class of traffic characterizations described in Section 2.1. We assume without loss of generality that connections are ordered so that i &lt; j whenever d i &lt; d j . Then the schedulability conditions are given as follows for a set of connections C [74]: Theorem 3.1 A set C of connections given by f (A fl j ; d j )g j2C is EDF-schedulable if and only if for all t d 1 : X A fl d k &gt;t This condition can be considerably simplified for the practical traffic models described in Section <p> 3.1 A set C of connections given by f (A fl j ; d j )g j2C is EDF-schedulable if and only if for all t d 1 : X A fl d k &gt;t This condition can be considerably simplified for the practical traffic models described in Section 3.1 <ref> [74] </ref>. 3.2.2.2 Static-Priority (SP) An SP-scheduler partitions the set C of connections into P connection sets fC p g 1pP , where all connections in set C p have the same delay bound d p , with d p &lt; d q for p &lt; q. <p> However, the conditions are not exact for more realistic discrete traffic scenarios. For a particular discrete traffic specification [31], Zhang and Ferrari [111], and Zhang [108] have derived several sufficient schedulability conditions. The following necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions for SP schedulers are presented in <ref> [74] </ref>: Theorem 3.2 A set C of connections given by f (A fl j ; d j )g j2C is SP-schedulable if and only if for all priorities p and for all t 0 there exists a t with t d p s min p such that: t + t j2C <p> Second, for a fixed priority p and fixed value of t, condi tion (3.10) must possibly be tested for the entire range of values of t . Similar to EDF, the conditions can be considerably simplified for the traffic models described in Section 3.1 <ref> [74] </ref>. 3.2.3 Discussion of Tradeoffs A packet scheduling discipline for a bounded-delay service should satisfy both of the following criteria: * The scheduling discipline should be able to support a diverse set of connections with different traffic characterizations and delay constraints while maintaining high network utilization. 3.2. <p> In this chapter, we consider the design of packet schedulers appropriate for use in networks with a bounded-delay service. Many packet schedulers have been considered for use in bounded-delay services [31, 32, 41, 52, 111]. The well-known Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) scheduler has been studied in <ref> [31, 38, 39, 74] </ref> and is distinguished in that it has optimal efficiency: for a given set of connections, EDF can support delay guarantees that are at least as tight as those provided by any other packet scheduler [38, 74]. <p> The well-known Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) scheduler has been studied in [31, 38, 39, 74] and is distinguished in that it has optimal efficiency: for a given set of connections, EDF can support delay guarantees that are at least as tight as those provided by any other packet scheduler <ref> [38, 74] </ref>. Each packet arriving to an EDF scheduler is assigned a deadline equal to the sum of its arrival time and associated delay bound, and queued packets are transmitted in increasing order of deadline. <p> FIFO 0 is included to hold packets from FIFO 1 that have not violated their deadlines at the time of a queue rotation. Arriving packets are never inserted directly into FIFO 0. In <ref> [74] </ref> necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions are derived for RPQ that guarantee the transmission of all packets before their deadlines, and we next state these conditions. Let s max p denote the maximum transmission time of a packet from C p . <p> Let s max p denote the maximum transmission time of a packet from C p . All packets from a set of connections C will be transmitted prior to their deadlines if and only 5.1.

Reducing should result in higher efficiency at the expense of higher overhead costs due to more frequent priority relabeling. However, the efficiency of RPQ may be lower than SP for some choices of . In <ref> [74] </ref> we presented the following pathological example where RPQ cannot admit connections that are admissible by both EDF and SP. <p> conditions from Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 for EDF and SP, respectively; and the condition in equation (5.1) for RPQ. 5.6.1 Numerical Example In the first experiment we compute the schedulable region of the packet schedulers for a set of three connection groups using an approach similar to one used in <ref> [49, 74] </ref>. We vary the traffic rate of each connection group and use a surface plot to illustrate the rates for which all delay bounds are guaranteed. We can compare the efficiencies of different packet schedulers graphically by comparing the volumes of their schedulable regions.

Reference-contexts: Many approaches to traffic characterization do not provide a worst-case bound on the traffic arrivals of a connection and therefore cannot be employed in a bounded-delay service that provides worst-case guarantees <ref> [5, 34, 37, 45, 47, 53, 79] </ref>.

WFQ approximates GPS in the same way that VC approximates TDM: packets are assigned virtual finishing times corresponding with the time they would complete transmission in a GPS system <ref> [25, 82] </ref>. Each connection is assigned a service share, and the kth packet on connection i that has transmission time s and arrival time t is assigned the following virtual finishing time: F k i maxft; F k1 i g + P i 3.2. <p> WFQ simulates a GPS system and orders packets according to their departure times in the simulated system.

They show that a packet which departs a GPS scheduler at time t will depart a WFQ scheduler no later than time t + s max , where s max is the maximum transmission time of any packet in the system.

Reference-contexts: We finally evaluate RPQ + in Section 5.6 using numerical examples as well as MPEG-compressed video traces. 5.1 Related Work Recently, several packet schedulers have been considered that approximate EDF with simple implementations <ref> [72, 75, 84, 85] </ref>.

We first review in Section 5.1.1 the HOL-PJ scheduler presented in <ref> [75, 85] </ref> that inserts a packet into a FIFO based on its deadline and subsequently moves individual packets to higher-priority FIFOs as dictated by their laxities.

Instead, they use so-called calendar queues [15, 52] that relabel FIFOs periodically to increase the priorities of queued packets. 5.1. <p> The timer for FIFO q expires when the first packet in FIFO q violates the laxity of this queue. Then the packet is dequeued and inserted into FIFO (q 1). A generalization of HOL-PJ called the recirculation architecture is presented in <ref> [85] </ref>. Note that HOL-PJ is an exact implementation of EDF. HOL-PJ has advantages over straightforward implementations of EDF with a single transmission queue in that inserting and removing packets can be performed independent of the number of queued packets. <p> Note that the copying of packets can be avoided in shared-memory switches in which FIFO queues are implemented as linked lists. 5.1.2 Priority Relabeling Architecture In the priority relabeling architecture presented by Peha and Tobagi <ref> [84, 85] </ref>, supported delay bounds are of the form d p = p for 1 p P , where is a parameter of the scheduler. The maximum delay bound supported by the priority relabeling architecture is P . <p> Packets that reside in FIFO 1 during such a relabeling are considered as a special case; either (1) all packets in FIFO 1 are dropped, or (2) FIFO 1 and FIFO 2 are concatenated to form the new FIFO 1. Although <ref> [85] </ref> recommends the 5.1. Related Work 84 former choice, i.e., dropping packets in FIFO 1, for services in which late packets are to be dropped, observe that the scheduler may drop packets that have not violated their deadlines. <p> As compared to HOL-PJ, the priority relabeling architecture has a much simpler implementation since it requires only a single timer and does not require the movement of queued packets. The relabeling of FIFOs can be accomplished by simply altering an offset in the priority selector <ref> [85] </ref>, and the additional implementation overhead as compared to an SP scheduler is in the relabeling of priorities. To avoid copying packets during the concatenation of FIFO 1 and FIFO 2, the FIFOs must implemented as linked lists in shared memory.

Rathgeb shows how the parameters of each traffic policing mechanism can be expressed in terms of parameters of the other mechanisms, enabling a direct comparison of the various mechanisms. <p> However, both studies also note that the use of a single leaky bucket which employs only one rate parameter cannot achieve acceptable accuracies. However, it was shown in [103] that the (~; ~)-model which employs multiple leaky bucket mechanisms can accurately characterize VBR video. Both Dittmann [26] and Rathgeb <ref> [86] </ref> consider the implementation complexity of the traffic policing mechanisms. These studies showed that the moving window mechanism is significantly more difficult to implement than either the jumping window or leaky bucket mechanisms. <p> We also note that efficient implementations of the moving window mechanism must be optimized for a single value of I , and so the mechanism is inflexible <ref> [86] </ref>. Conversely, since the jumping window and leaky bucket can be implemented with similar overhead costs and require less state information (i.e., the entire state is determined by a counter value and a timer), these mechanisms allow for flexible dimensioning. <p> While admission control mechanisms require that traffic characterizations are accurate in describing the worst-case traffic, traffic policing mechanisms that monitor in real time if the traffic submitted to the network conforms to its traffic characterization require a simple traffic characterization <ref> [86] </ref>. Therefore, the choice of traffic characterization method 45 46 is a tradeoff between the high accuracy preferred by admission control mechanisms and the simplicity required for implementing traffic policing mechanisms. <p> As we discussed in Chapter 3, the (~; ~)-model that can be policed with a fixed number of leaky bucket policing mechanisms satisfies both criteria to a high degree. Since a leaky bucket can be implemented with a single counter and a single timer <ref> [86] </ref>, leaky buckets seem to satisfy the need for simple traffic characterizations. In a previous study [103], we showed that concave piecewise-linear functions ("leaky buckets") are capable of accurately characterizing VBR video traffic. However, the number of leaky buckets needed for an accurate characterization was shown to be large.

We then review studies that evaluate and compare the tradeoffs involved with each traffic model. 3.1.1 Peak-rate model The peak-rate model is the simplest and most widely used of all traffic models [6]. <p> Thus, the (r; T )-model enforces an average rate r while allowing for moderate bursts. Note that r specifies the maximum average transmission rate for a compliant connection. Traffic conforming to the (r; T )-model can be policed with the jumping window policing mechanism which is implemented as follows <ref> [87] </ref>. At the beginning of each frame, a credit counter is set to rT . This counter is decremented by 1 for each bit that enters the network, and packets can only enter the network if sufficient credit is available, i.e., the counter must always be nonnegative. <p> Traffic Characterization 33 We next review the results of several studies that have evaluated the various traffic models with respect to these two requirements <ref> [26, 86, 87, 88, 103] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, it is difficult to design simple policing mechanisms to enforce statistical properties of a traffic source in real time [10]. With regard to packet scheduling, research from the real-time community (e.g., <ref> [67, 68, 76, 97] </ref>) uses assumptions that are inappropriate for QoS networks, i.e., connections are assumed to have periodic packet arrivals where all packets on a connection have identical service times and a delay bound equal to the period. The system is also assumed to be preemptive.

Reference-contexts: Our goal is to design methods that can be implemented straightforwardly and result in a high network utilization. 1.3 Our Approach to Characterization and Scheduling The approach of this work is motivated by a study in <ref> [103] </ref> by Wrege, Knightly, Zhang, and Liebeherr. In this paper, the authors explore network utilization limits of a deterministic service by combining the tightest traffic characterizations and the best-possible packet scheduling discipline with its necessary and sufficient delay bound tests. <p> In this chapter we review approaches to traffic characterization and packet scheduling suitable for use in networks with a bounded-delay service. In Section 3.1 we review a 23 3.1. Traffic Characterization 24 number of deterministic traffic models <ref> [23, 24, 31, 41, 55, 103] </ref>. We consider both the traffic constraint function that specifies the maximum traffic conforming to each model as well as available traffic policing mechanisms for enforcement. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each traffic characterization method. <p> In this section we review six such traffic models which have been considered for use in bounded-delay services: the peak-rate model [3], the (; )-model [23], the (~; ~)- model <ref> [24, 103] </ref>, the (r; T )-model [41], the (X min ; X ave ; I ; s max )-model [29, 31], and the D-BIND model [55, 58]. <p> The maximum burst admitted by the (r; T )-model is proportional to the rate and is given by 2rT . 3.1.4 (~; ~)-model A generalization of the (; )-model is the (~; ~) traffic model <ref> [24, 103] </ref> which corresponds to a traffic policing mechanism where multiple leaky buckets are connected in series. <p> The resulting traffic constraint function, denoted as B fl m , is a function consisting of m piecewise-linear 3.1. Traffic Characterization 29 segments <ref> [24, 103] </ref>: B fl 1im Note that B fl in equation (3.3) is identical to B fl 1 in equation (3.4). <p> Traffic Characterization 33 We next review the results of several studies that have evaluated the various traffic models with respect to these two requirements <ref> [26, 86, 87, 88, 103] </ref>. We note that these studies do not focus on the six traffic models we just discussed but rather consider the traffic policing mechanisms upon which these traffic models are based: jumping window, moving window, and leaky bucket. <p> However, both studies also note that the use of a single leaky bucket which employs only one rate parameter cannot achieve acceptable accuracies. However, it was shown in <ref> [103] </ref> that the (~; ~)-model which employs multiple leaky bucket mechanisms can accurately characterize VBR video. Both Dittmann [26] and Rathgeb [86] consider the implementation complexity of the traffic policing mechanisms. <p> Since a leaky bucket can be implemented with a single counter and a single timer [86], leaky buckets seem to satisfy the need for simple traffic characterizations. In a previous study <ref> [103] </ref>, we showed that concave piecewise-linear functions ("leaky buckets") are capable of accurately characterizing VBR video traffic. However, the number of leaky buckets needed for an accurate characterization was shown to be large. For example, up to a dozen leaky buckets are needed to accurately characterize MPEG-I video streams [103]. <p> study <ref> [103] </ref>, we showed that concave piecewise-linear functions ("leaky buckets") are capable of accurately characterizing VBR video traffic. However, the number of leaky buckets needed for an accurate characterization was shown to be large. For example, up to a dozen leaky buckets are needed to accurately characterize MPEG-I video streams [103]. Since practical considerations limit the number of available leaky buckets to a small value, e.g., the limit is two for ATM connections [1], methods are needed that yield an accurate VBR traffic characterization, yet, with only a small number of leaky buckets. <p> In this chapter, we present a solution to the problem of constructing an accurate traffic characterization for stored VBR video with few leaky buckets. Our solution approach is based on the so-called empirical envelope of a video sequence described in Chapter 1 <ref> [103] </ref>. As we will show in Section 4.2, the empirical envelope for a connection is the most accurate deterministic traffic characterization. <p> Wrege, Knightly, Zhang, and Liebeherr present in <ref> [103] </ref> a traffic characterization, referred to as the "empirical envelope", that maximizes resource utilization. <p> They show how to approximate the empirical envelope with leaky buckets, however, the number of parameters of the resulting traffic constraint function is considerable: up to 12 leaky buckets were needed for an accurate characterization of an MPEG video sequence <ref> [103] </ref>. Also, the computational complexity of the characterization algorithms was substantial. 4.2. A Fast Characterization Method for VBR Video 50 Here we present a method to obtain VBR video traffic characterizations that can be policed by a small, fixed number of leaky buckets. <p> A Fast Characterization Method for VBR Video 50 Here we present a method to obtain VBR video traffic characterizations that can be policed by a small, fixed number of leaky buckets. The computational complexity our our method is low and efficient as compared to the methods in <ref> [46, 103] </ref>. In Subsection 3.1 we discuss the tradeoffs of traffic characterization methods that are based on the empirical envelope. <p> Following, in Subsections 3.2 and 3.3, we present and evaluate the new solution approach to VBR video characterization. 4.2.1 The Empirical Envelope E fl The tightest traffic constraint function for a given traffic source is its empirical envelope, denoted by E fl <ref> [17, 103] </ref>. The empirical envelope E fl of a video sequence is optimal in the sense that, for any subadditive traffic constraint function A fl that satisfies equation (2.1), A fl (t) E fl (t) for all t. The empirical envelope E fl is given by the following equation [17, 103]: <p> fl <ref> [17, 103] </ref>. The empirical envelope E fl of a video sequence is optimal in the sense that, for any subadditive traffic constraint function A fl that satisfies equation (2.1), A fl (t) E fl (t) for all t. The empirical envelope E fl is given by the following equation [17, 103]: E fl (t) = sup A [t; t + t] 8t 0 (4.3) Note from equation (4.3) that E fl is subadditive. The following method presented in [103] obtains the empirical envelope of a given video sequence consisting of N frames with fixed inter-frame time r. <p> The empirical envelope E fl is given by the following equation [17, 103]: E fl (t) = sup A [t; t + t] 8t 0 (4.3) Note from equation (4.3) that E fl is subadditive. The following method presented in <ref> [103] </ref> obtains the empirical envelope of a given video sequence consisting of N frames with fixed inter-frame time r. We assume that frames are fragmented into 53-byte ATM cells with a payload of 48 bytes each, and these cells are transmitted at equally-spaced intervals over the frame time r. <p> If the sequence of frame sizes of a video sequence is given by ff 1 ; f 2 ; : : : ; f N g, then the empirical envelope E fl can be constructed by calculating <ref> [103] </ref>: E fl (ir) = max k+i1 X f j for i = 1; 2; : : : N (4.4) Note that equation (4.4) defines N parameters fE fl (ir) j 1 i N g for the empirical envelope, where E fl (r) is equal to the largest frame in the <p> Since the empirical envelope E fl does not conform to a parameterized traffic model, it is difficult to police. In previous work, we showed how to determine a (~; ~)-model traffic characterization based on the concave hull of E fl , which we denote by HE fl <ref> [103] </ref>. 1 Since the function HE fl is the smallest piecewise-linear concave function larger than E fl [21], HE fl is most accurate traffic characterization that can be policed by leaky buckets. In Figure 4.1 we illustrate the traffic characterization method from [103] with an example. <p> fl , which we denote by HE fl <ref> [103] </ref>. 1 Since the function HE fl is the smallest piecewise-linear concave function larger than E fl [21], HE fl is most accurate traffic characterization that can be policed by leaky buckets. In Figure 4.1 we illustrate the traffic characterization method from [103] with an example. The cumulative traffic arrivals A for a traffic source are depicted in Figure 4.1 (a). Figures 4.1 (b) and 4.1 (c) show the empirical envelope E fl and the concave hull HE fl , respectively, for this traffic source. <p> In also plot the empirical envelope E fl and its concave hull HE fl . 4.2.2 Approximating the Envelope with Extrapolations The traffic characterization method outlined in the previous subsection was shown <ref> [103] </ref> to produce very accurate traffic characterizations based on the empirical envelope. However, the empirical envelope requires a large number of parameters, that is, one parameter per frame in the sequence. <p> Note that HR fl k can be expressed in terms of the (~; ~) model as follows: HR fl n = min f i + i tg; (4.7) where parameters i and i are determined by some appropriate algorithm to compute the concave hull of a function, e.g. <ref> [103] </ref>. We review the extrapolation methods in Figure 4.3. Figure 4.3 (a) illustrates the relationship between the empirical envelope E fl and its approximation E fl k , the largest subadditive extrapolation of the first k parameters of E fl . <p> We set fixed = 1000 cells since this choice yields better empirical performance. We also add a cell-spacer to enforce the peak rate peak of the connection. (d) Concave hull: The concave hull approach in <ref> [103] </ref> selects m (^; ^) pairs for traffic characterization that are taken directly from the concave hull of the empirical envelope HE fl . <p> Using a better heuristic algorithm such as the one developed in this chapter, one can achieve markedly higher performance. 4.5. Summary and Remarks 79 * In <ref> [103] </ref>, the numerical examples indicated that a large number of leaky bucket pairs were needed to approximate the empirical envelope. Using our method, the number of leaky buckets needed to achieve performance similar to the envelope is small. This discrepancy can be explained as follows. <p> Using our method, the number of leaky buckets needed to achieve performance similar to the envelope is small. This discrepancy can be explained as follows. First, the heuristic algorithm presented here is superior to the concave hull approach from <ref> [103] </ref>. Second, we note that the examples in this chapter only consider delay bounds up to 500ms, while the examples in [103] consider delay bounds up to 2000ms. <p> This discrepancy can be explained as follows.

Second, we note that the examples in this chapter only consider delay bounds up to 500ms, while the examples in [103] consider delay bounds up to 2000ms. <p> We use the so-called empirical envelope of a video sequence to characterize its traffic, where the empirical envelope E fl of a sequence with traffic A is given by <ref> [17, 103] </ref>: E fl (t) = sup A [t; t + t] 8t 0 (5.29) The empirical envelope is the tightest traffic characterization available for a video sequence and, when used with admission control, will result in the admission of a maximal number of connections.

Reference-contexts: However, packets may be delayed or dropped arbitrarily. Intermediate services have been investigated that provide QoS guarantees between these two extremes, trading off QoS and network utilization. Among these service types are (i) statistical services that provide probabilistic bounds on the percentage of packets delivered within the QoS constraints <ref> [8, 27, 31, 54, 60, 113] </ref>, (ii) services with bounded degradation that allow a client to specify a degradation of service commitments for a fixed portion of traffic [71], and (iii) predictive services that estimate the QoS of a connection based on measurements of current resource usage [13, 20, 51]. <p> Regarding video traffic characterization, many approaches characterize traffic sources using sophisticated stochastic models such as Markov-modulated [47], autoregressive [48, 50, 59], self-similar [5, 37], TES [50, 79], and S-BIND <ref> [60, 113] </ref>. These approaches do not do not provide a worst-case bound on traffic arrivals and therefore cannot be used as a traffic characterization as described in Chapter 2.1. Additionally, it is difficult to design simple policing mechanisms to enforce statistical properties of a traffic source in real time [10].

Reference-contexts: In a network that employs renegotiation, traffic characterizations are occasionally modified to exploit long-term traffic variations of the VBR video traffic source, possibly leading to increased network utilization <ref> [19, 44, 114] </ref>. Since a renegotiation scheme requires multiple traffic characterizations for a single connection, a fast traffic characterization scheme such as the one described in this chapter can be used to renegotiate traffic parameters. <p> Most renegotiation schemes that have been proposed attempt to renegotiate the traffic characterization of a connection whenever its long-term rate changes significantly <ref> [19, 44, 114] </ref>. Chong et. al. address the problem of predicting the rate changes of a live video source [19]. They consider both a recursive least-square method and an artificial neural network approach for the prediction. <p> They present algorithms for partitioning a video sequence into segments based on cost functions for both bandwidth allocation and number of renegotiations. Zhang and Knightly study a renegotiated VBR service for both stored and live video in <ref> [114] </ref>. Their algorithm for stored video proceeds by identifying the worst-case segment of the video sequence, characterizing this worst-case segment, and then iteratively repeating the procedure on the remaining video sequence after this worst-case segment is removed.
