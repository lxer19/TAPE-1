Abstract: Decision Trees have been widely used for classification/regression tasks. They are relatively much faster to build as compared to Neural Networks and are understandable by humans. In normal decision trees, based on the input vector, only one branch is followed. In Probabilistic OPtion trees, based on the input vector we follow all of the subtrees with some probability. These probabilities are learned by the system. Probabilistic decisions are likely to be useful, when the boundary of classes submerge in each other, or when there is noise in the input data. In addition they provide us with a confidence measure. We allow option nodes in our trees, Again, instead of uniform voting, we learn the weightage of every subtree.
