Reference-contexts: By understanding well the connection between field theories and their point particle versions, one may hope to understand the connection between strings in a first-quantized form and in a form suitable for nonperturbative calculations. In this note it is demonstrated that the unitary propagator is obtained from a Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky <ref> [1] </ref> quantization of the action proposed by Berezin and Marinov [2] for the pseudoclassical description of the Dirac electron. When computing the propagator, other authors [3,4] have found a factor of fl 5 .

Reference-contexts: In this note it is demonstrated that the unitary propagator is obtained from a Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky [1] quantization of the action proposed by Berezin and Marinov <ref> [2] </ref> for the pseudoclassical description of the Dirac electron. When computing the propagator, other authors [3,4] have found a factor of fl 5 . Such a factor ruins the unitarity of the propagator, which must be unitary since the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky path integral is manifestly unitary. <p> The pseudoclassical version of the Dirac electron is a nice example of a system whose second-class constraints may be treated in canonical quantization in an elegant fashion. 2. The Classical Dirac Electron The first classical action for the Dirac electron using anticommuting variables was written by Berezin and Marinov <ref> [2] </ref>. S = dt [m _x 2 + 2 In this action the variables ~ ; ~ 5 and are anticommuting while x is commuting. 1 The notation u is a shorthand for _x = p _x 2 .

Reference-contexts: In fact, because it is second-class, it cannot be imposed on a state directly. The easiest way to take it into account is to follow Bordi and Casalbuoni <ref> [3] </ref> in imposing the condition that the Hilbert space separate into physical states and unphysical states which are orthogonal to the physical states. Further, we suppose that the constraint maps physical into unphysical states. <p> The path integral over the variable ~ 5 can be done as in Bordi and Casalbuoni <ref> [3] </ref>, or directly by discretization of the integral K (~ f j~ i ) := ~(0)=~ i R t 2 ~ _ ~+~) = (~ f ~ i + it )e ~ f ~ i =2 : (29) This expression is not the propagator, but the symbol of the propagator [6],

Reference-contexts: A locally supersymmetric superfield formulation has been written by Brink, Deser, Zumino, Di Vecchia, and Howe <ref> [5] </ref> for the massless case. To write a locally supersymmetric version for the massive case, presumably one should treat X 5 as a D = 1 spinor and introduce a D = 1 supermetric. 3.
