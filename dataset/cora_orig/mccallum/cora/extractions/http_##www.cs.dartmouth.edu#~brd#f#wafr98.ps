Abstract: As improvements in fabrication technology for MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) increase the availability and diversity of these micromachines, engineers are defining a growing number of tasks to which they can be put. The idea of carrying out tasks using large coordinated systems of MEMS units motivates the development of automated, algorithmic methods for designing and controlling these groups of devices. We report here on progress towards algorithmic MEMS, taking on the challenge of design, control, and programming of massively-parallel arrays of microactua-tors. We report on these developments in this focused survey paper, based on the research results originally reported in our 1994 paper [26] and developed further in [22, 20, 27, 23, 18, 21, 19, 26, 12, 15, 16, 9]. We describe how arrays of MEMS devices can move and position tiny parts, such as integrated circuit chips, in flexible and predictable ways by oscillatory or ciliary action. The theory of programmable force fields can model this action, leading to algorithms for various types of micromanipulation that require no sensing of where the part is. Experiments support the theory. We also report on how the theory and results can be generalized to the macroscopic scale [10, 11].

Reference-contexts: Does there exist a universal field that, for every part P , has only one unique equilibrium (up to part sym metry)? Such a field could be used to build a universal parts feeder <ref> [1] </ref> that uniquely positions a part without the need of a clock, sensors, or programming. In [22], we proposed a combined radial and "gravitational" field R + ffiG which might have this property. ffi is a small positive constant, and G is defined as G (x; y) = (0; 1). <p> In [22], we proposed a combined radial and "gravitational" field R + ffiG which might have this property. ffi is a small positive constant, and G is defined as G (x; y) = (0; 1). This device design is inspired by the "universal gripper" in <ref> [1] </ref>. Such a field could be obtained from a MEMS array that implements a unit radial force field. Instead of rectangular actuators in a regular grid, triangular actuators could be laid out in a polar-coordinate grid. The array could then be tilted slightly to obtain the gravity component.

Reference-contexts: We denote the collection of points dual to area bisectors of P in that range by fi. Note that any (besides =2) corresponds to an x-coordinate in the dual plane. The curve fi is a piece-wise algebraic and x-monotone curve (this is proved in <ref> [17] </ref>).
