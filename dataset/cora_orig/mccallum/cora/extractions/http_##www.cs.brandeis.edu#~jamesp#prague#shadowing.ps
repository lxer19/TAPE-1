Abstract: In this paper, I discuss the issues of compositionality and polysemy as they relate to current accounts of verbal alternations in linguistic theory. I first explore generally how alternations can be seen as emerging from a semantic theory that takes advantage of lexical underspecification and generative mechanisms of composition. Such well-studied alternations such as causative-inchoative and control-raising pairs can be successfully analyzed as resulting from the interaction of richer modes of composition and a semantics admitting of underspecified representations. I then examine a particular alternation involving verbs such as risk and cost, as well as cognate object verbs such as dance and butter. I refer to this alternation as lexical shadowing. This alternation is interesting because it cuts across the traditional categories as presented in Levin (1993). I discuss the current major analyses of such verbs, and show that these solutions fail to capture the lexical polymorphism in the alternation, and are only weakly compositional at best. I show how the complement behavior of verbs such as risk involves coercion on an underspecified lexical semantic representation. I close with a discussion of the selectional properties of complex relations such as read and rent, and how this impacts the theory of closure.

Reference-contexts: Consider briefly the behavior of rent. This verb is interesting because it allows for two subcategorizations, each corresponding to a distinct interpretation of the verb. Observe in (77) how the directionality of the relation is affected or dictated by the prepositional phrase selected for <ref> (cf. Bierwisch, 1983, Jackendoff, 1983) </ref>. (77) a. Mary rented the room from John. b. Mary rented the room to John. The interpretation given in one sentence entails the interpretation provided for in the other.

Reference-contexts: I will refer to such supralexical semantic representations or meta-predicate relations as projective structures <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1991, 1996b) </ref>. In order to better understand the nature of projective structures, let us review some basic assumptions regarding the lexical type lattice which structures the types employed by the semantics. <p> For each type, t , at each level, l, the projective conclusion space, (t l ), is computed from the application of all possible one-, two-, and three-step transformations over the base type <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1991) </ref>. This procedure and an explanation of the type structure syntax for the concept lattice is presented in Pustejovsky (1996b). As an example of this method for generating types, consider the following derivation. The top type existence is expressible of any single object, without constraints.

Reference-contexts: Hence, rather than a conventional Davidsonian-like representation for a verb such as build, shown in (12), (12) yxe [build (e; x; y) ^ 1 (e; x) ^ 2 (e; y)] I assume a richer lexical structure called Orthogonal Parameter Binding <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1995a) </ref>. In this system, the logical arguments of an expression are separated by type, where logical arguments are distinct from the event structure arguments defined for a particular lexical item.

Reference-contexts: This is the state of there being an individual, arg2, defined as being made of the material from the default argument <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1995b, for discussion) </ref>. As mentioned above, the type of the argument will affect how and whether it is realized in the syntax. For true arguments, the translation to conventional modes of typing is fairly straightforward, as the examples below illustrate. (20) Interpretation of Qualia Structure as Types: a.

Reference-contexts: Projective structures are useful for several reasons. Not only do they model what appears to be the intuitive nature of the relations between concepts, as with the opposition structures shown above, but they give rise to grammatical consequences as well <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1996b, for discussion) </ref>. Each member entering into an oppositional pairing, such as solvency and bankruptcy, life and death, and so forth, will encode that it is part of an opposition structure in its qualia.

Reference-contexts: Lexical Inheritance Structure: Identification of how a lexical structure is related to other structures in the type lattice. A set of generative devices connects these four levels, providing for the compositional interpretation of words in context <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1995) </ref>. The exact nature of these devices determines the polymorphic expressiveness of the semantics in fairly restrictive ways. These devices include type coercion, subselection, and co-composition. Our interest in this paper is to explain the polymorphic behavior of verbs which allow lexical shadowing of their arguments. <p> The apparently contradictory nature of the two senses for each pair actually reveals a deeper structure relating these senses, what I will call a dot object <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1995) </ref>. For each sense pair, there is a relation which "connects" the senses in a well-defined way. I will characterize this structure as a Cartesian type product of n types, with 16 a particularly restricted interpretation. <p> What is important to note, however, is that the dot object construction (i.e., the type product) allows otherwise contradictory types to be combined into a single type. From a conceptual development point of view, this suggests that complex types are in fact learned later than simple or unified types <ref> (cf. Pustejovsky, 1995, for some discussion) </ref>. In the previous section, we saw that certain classes of nominals, i.e., en-docentric dot objects, have qualia values which are relations selecting for the dot objects directly.
