Abstract: The use of artificial neural networks in the domain of autonomous vehicle navigation has produced promising results. ALVINN [Pomerleau, 1991] has shown that a neural system can drive a vehicle reliably and safely on many different types of roads, ranging from paved paths to interstate highways. Even with these impressive results, several areas within the neural paradigm for autonomous road following still need to be addressed. These include transparent navigation between roads of different type, simultaneous use of different sensors, and generalization to road types which the neural system has never seen. The system presented here addresses these issue with a modular neural architecture which uses pre-trained ALVINN networks and a connectionist superstructure to robustly drive on many dif ferent types of roads.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that modular neural networks can learn to allocate their resources to match a given problem, such as locating and identifying objects in an input retina [Jacobs, 1990], while the cascade correlation algorithm provides a way to produce appropriately sized networks. <ref> [Fahlman, 1990] </ref> By using similar techniques in a MANIAC-like system, the need to pretrain ALVINN networks would be eliminated. It is not clear, though, how new information would be incorporated into this type of system once it has been trained. 6.

Reference-contexts: Creating training exemplars from existing network weights is essentially the network inversion problem. Techniques such as those developed by <ref> [Linden, 1989] </ref> may provide clues of how to do this one to many mapping that can create an input exemplar from an output target.

ALVINN has many characteristics which make it desirable as a robust, general purpose road following system. They include: ALVINN learns the features that are required for driving on the particular road type for which it is trained.
