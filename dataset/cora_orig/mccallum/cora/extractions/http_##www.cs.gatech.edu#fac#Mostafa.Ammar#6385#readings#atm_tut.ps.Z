Title: A Brief Overview of ATM: Protocol Layers, LAN Emulation, and Traffic Management  
Author: Kai-Yeung Siu Raj Jain 
Abstract: Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) has emerged as the most promising technology in supporting future broadband multimedia communication services. To accelerate the deployment of ATM technology, the ATM Forum, which is a consortium of service providers and equipment vendors in the communication industries, has been created to develop implementation and specification agreements. In this article, we present a brief overview on ATM protocol layers and current progress on LAN Emulation and Traffic Management in the ATM Forum.

Reference-contexts: At the time of this writing, the ATM Forum's work on Multiprotocol over ATM is still under development. This approach and the technical challenges will be discussed in the article of Armitage <ref> [1] </ref> in this special issue. Another approach is the provision of an ATM protocol to emulate existing LAN services, allowing network layer protocols to operate as if they are still connected to a conventional LAN.

Reference-contexts: However, the early rate-based proposals were found to suffer problems of fairness [4]. One approach to fixing the problems is by keeping track of the rate for each VC (per-VC accounting) [7], though such an approach also increases the switch complexity. Many of the current rate-based proposals <ref> [2, 10, 13, 14, 22, 26] </ref> use an alternative technique called "intelligent marking," originally proposed in [24] (see also [25]), which achieves fairness without the need of per-VC queueing nor per-VC accounting.

The industrial momentum behind ATM technology and the intensive research interest in ATM has led to a vast and diversified literature in recent years. We have made no attempt to include an exhaustive list of references. <p> The protocol reference model is divided into three layers: the ATM adaptation layer (AAL), the ATM layer, and the physical layer (Figure 1 <ref> [3] </ref>). 2.1 The ATM Adaptation Layer The ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL) interfaces the higher layer protocols to the ATM Layer. It relays ATM cells both from the upper layers to the ATM Layer and vice versa.

Reference-contexts: These rate-based schemes are based on end-to-end control and do not require per-VC queueing nor accounting. Thus, most switch vendors find the rate-based approaches appealing because of their simplicity and implementation flexibility. However, the early rate-based proposals were found to suffer problems of fairness <ref> [4] </ref>. One approach to fixing the problems is by keeping track of the rate for each VC (per-VC accounting) [7], though such an approach also increases the switch complexity.

Reference-contexts: For unspecified QoS traffic such as ABR service, whose traffic patterns are often highly bursty and unpredictable, congestion control poses more challenges than for other services. As described in <ref> [12] </ref>, one way to classify congestion control schemes is based on the layer of ISO/OSI reference model at which the scheme operates. For example, there are data link, routing, and transport layer congestion control schemes. Typically, a combination of such schemes is used.

Reference-contexts: Two major approaches - credit-based and rate-based have been proposed in the ATM.

Reference-contexts: At the NNI, the field contains 28 bits, allowing for over 268 million sessions to share a link within a subnet. We refer the readers to the discussion of important issues in Private Network-to-Node Interface (P-NNI) routing to the paper by Lee <ref> [18] </ref> of this special issue. The payload type indicator (PTI) field is used to distinguish between cells carrying user data and cells containing control information. This allows control and signaling data to be transmitted on a different subchannel from user data and hence separation of user and control data.

Reference-contexts: The credit-based schemes [16, 17] require link-by-link flow control and a separate buffer for each VC (per-VC queueing), which are considered by many switch vendors to be too expensive and inflexible. The rate-based schemes, originally proposed in <ref> [19] </ref>, make use of the "explicit forward congestion indication (EFCI)," a particular combination of the PTI field in the cell header that can be set by the switches during congestion. These rate-based schemes are based on end-to-end control and do not require per-VC queueing nor accounting.

Reference-contexts: In a connection-oriented network such as ATM, however, a source system needs to first set up a connection to the destination before it can transfer data frames. This requires the source system to exchange control information with the network using a signaling protocol. The paper by Stiller <ref> [27] </ref> of this special issue presents a survey of UNI signaling protocols for ATM networks. We shall not go into any further details on the signaling aspect of ATM. It should be noted that LAN emulation is not designed to provide translational bridging between legacy LANs.
