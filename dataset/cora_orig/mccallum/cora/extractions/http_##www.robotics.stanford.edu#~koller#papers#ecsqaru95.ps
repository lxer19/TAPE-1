Title: Constructing Flexible Dynamic Belief Networks from First-Order Probabilistic Knowledge Bases

Abstract: This paper investigates the power of first-order probabilistic logic (FOPL) as a representation language for complex dynamic situations. We introduce a sublanguage of FOPL and use it to provide a first-order version of dynamic belief networks. We show that this language is expressive enough to enable reasoning over time and to allow procedural representations of conditional probability tables. In particular, we define decision tree representations of conditional probability tables that can be used to decrease the size of the created belief networks. We provide an inference algorithm for our sublanguage using the paradigm of knowledge-based model construction. Given a FOPL knowledge base and a particular situation, our algorithm constructs a propositional dynamic belief network, which can be solved using standard belief network inference algorithms. In contrast to common dynamic belief networks, the structure of our networks is more flexible and better adapted to the given situation. We demonstrate the expressive power of our language and the flexibility of the resulting belief networks using a simple knowledge base modeling the propagation of infectious diseases.

Reference-contexts: The structure of the network can also be used to make the probabilistic inference process more efficient. For example, the join tree algorithm, which is also used in our implementation, is a clustering method that has been implemented in the HUGIN system <ref> [1] </ref>. In spite of their success, belief networks have a significant limitation as a general framework for knowledge representation, since they lack the ability to generalize over (a potentially infinite set of) individuals.

Reference-contexts: We describe a sublanguage of FOPL, built over Prolog, and demonstrate its expressive power. In particular, we present a knowledge base modelling the propagation of infectious diseases. An example of another knowledge base, modeling the behavior of traffic, can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. We present an inference algorithm for this language using the paradigm of knowledge-based model construction. This algorithm takes a knowledge base in our language and a particular situation and generates a standard belief network appropriate for this situation. <p> The first domain models the propagation of infectious diseases; we used AIDS as our example. The second domain is a simple partial model of traffic behavior on highways; it emphasizes the random variable that a lane change is safe. For details of this second knowledge base, we refer to <ref> [4] </ref>. The first-order belief network structure for the AIDS knowledge base was given above in Fig. 1. As described in the previous section, our variables in this domain are aids (X,T) and contact (X,Y,T). The probabilities for the aids rule are as specified in Fig. 2.

Alternatively (although this is not yet implemented in our system), we could automatically discretize these nodes according to the user's specification. 4 Constructing the Models Our network construction algorithm extends that of Haddawy and Krieger <ref> [6] </ref> to deal with procedural descriptions of CPTs and with modular specification of multiple influences on a node. In particular, our implementation allows more than one rule with the same head, and can also handle rules that have free variables in the body given the instantiated head. <p> These variables are instantiated at run-time with all domain elements. Roughly speaking, the algorithm works as follows. As in the algorithm of <ref> [6] </ref>, it backward chains from the query and from the evidence. Each ground fact generated in this process forms a node A in the network. The parents of A are generated from the bodies of all the rules whose head match this ground fact.

Their knowledge base represents the topology and conditional probability tables of a first-order belief network in the FOPL language.

Reference-contexts: When constructing the propositional belief network, our implementation could express these variables as continuous-valued nodes. The inference on the resulting networks could be executed by stochastic simulation algorithms, since these are capable of doing inference in networks containing both discrete and continuous variables. In certain cases, the approach of <ref> [9] </ref> could also be used.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years, belief networks (or Bayesian networks) <ref> [10] </ref> have emerged as the method of choice for reasoning under uncertainty. Belief networks utilize the underlying causal structure of the domain to make probabilistic reasoning practical, both in terms of knowledge representation and in terms of inference. The causal structure is represented graphically, as a directed acyclic graph.
