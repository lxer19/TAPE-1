Title: MAC/FAC: A Model of Similarity-based Retrieval

Abstract: We present a model of similarity-based retrieval which attempts to capture three psychological phenomena: (1) people are extremely good at judging similarity and analogy when given items to compare. (2) Superficial remindings are much more frequent than structural remindings. (3) People sometimes experience and use purely structural analogical re-mindings. Our model, called MAC/FAC (for "many are called but few are chosen") consists of two stages. The first stage (MAC) uses a computationally cheap, non-structural matcher to filter candidates from a pool of memory items. That is, we redundantly encode structured representations as content vectors, whose dot product yields an estimate of how well the corresponding structural representations will match. The second stage (FAC) uses SME to compute a true structural match between the probe and output from the first stage. MAC/FAC has been fully implemented, and we show that it is capable of modeling patterns of access found in psychological data.

Reference-contexts: But the requirement of judging soundness, essential to establishing whether a match can yield useful results, suggests an expensive match process. A common solution is to use a two-stage process, where a computationally cheap filter is used to pick out a subset of likely candidates for more expensive processing <ref> (c.f. Bareiss & King, 1989) </ref>. MAC/FAC uses this strategy. The 2 The finding is not that higher-order relations do not contribute to retrieval. Adding higher-order relations led to non-significantly more retrieval in two studies and to a small but significant benefit in the third.

Reference-contexts: In subsequent processing, the structural evaluation provides one source of information about how seriously to take the match, and the candidate inferences provide potential new knowledge about the probe which must be tested and evaluated by other means. We implement this computation using SME, the Structure-Mapping Engine <ref> (Falkenhainer, Forbus & Gentner, 1989) </ref>. We use literal similarity rather than analogy in order to get the high observed frequency of surface remindings, which would mostly be rejected if FAC were strictly an analogy matcher.

Reference-contexts: Given that a person has some current target situation in working memory, transfer from prior knowledge requires at least (1) accessing a similar (base) situation in long-term memory, (2) creating a mapping from the base to the target, and (3) evaluating the mapping. In the structure-mapping framework <ref> (Gentner, 1983, 1988) </ref>, mapping is the process by which two representations present in working memory are aligned and further inferences imported. The process of computing a mapping from one situation to another is governed by the constraints of structural consistency and one-to-one mapping.

Reference-contexts: In a second study, subjects showed the same sensitivity to connectivity and sys-tematicity in choosing which predicates to map as candidate inferences from base to target. Further, people rate metaphors as more apt when they are based on relational commonalities than when they are based on common object-descriptions <ref> (Gentner & Clement, 1988) </ref> and they rate pairs of stories as more sound when they share higher-order relational structure than when they share object-descriptions (Gentner & Landers, 1985; Ratter-mann & Gentner, 1987). <p> Order effects in analogical problem solving (Keane, in press) suggest the latter.

Reference-contexts: Similarity-based Access from Long-term Memory: There is psychological evidence that access to long-term memory relies more on surface commonalities and less on structural commonalities than does mapping. For example, people often fail to access potentially useful analogs <ref> (Gick and Holyoak, 1980) </ref>. Ross (1984, 1987) further showed that, although people in a problem-solving task are often reminded of prior problems, these remindings are often based on surface similarity rather than on structural similarities between the solution principles.

Reference-contexts: We also find effects of relational structure on judgments of similarity (Goldstone, Medin & Gentner, in press; Rattermann & Gentner, 1987) and on the way in which people align perceptually similar pictures <ref> (Markman & Gentner, 1990) </ref>. An adequate model of human similarity and analogy must capture this sensitivity to structural commonality, by involving structural representations and processes that align them.
