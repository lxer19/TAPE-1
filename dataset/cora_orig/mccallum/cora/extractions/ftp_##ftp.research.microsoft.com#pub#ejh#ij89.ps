Abstract: We define and exercise the expected value of computation as a fundamental component of reflection about alternative inference strategies. We present a portion of Protos research focused on the interlacing of reflection and action under scarce resources, and discuss how the techniques have been applied in a high-stakes medical domain. The work centers on endowing a computational agent with the ability to harness incomplete characterizations of problem-solving performance to control the amount of effort applied to a problem or subproblem, before taking action in the world or turning to another problem. We explore the use of the techniques in controlling decision-theoretic inference itself, and pose the approach as a model of rationality under scarce resources.

Reference-contexts: Influence diagrams without preference or decision information are termed belief networks. A belief network defines a model for doing probabilistic inference in response to changes in information. The problem of probabilistic inference with belief networks is N P-hard <ref> [Cooper, 1990] </ref>. Thus, we can expect algorithms for doing inference to have a worst-case time complexity that is exponential in the size of the problem (e.g., the number of hypotheses and pieces of evidence). problem.

Reference-contexts: Some methods for inference in belief networks attempt to dodge intractability by exploiting independence relations to avoid the explicit calculation of the joint-probability distribution. A variety of exact methods has been developed, each designed to operate on particular topologies of belief networks <ref> [Horvitz et al., 1988a] </ref>. Other methods forego exact calculation of probabilities; these approximation techniques produce partial results as distributions or bounds over probabilities of interest. The complexity of precise inference and the availability of alternative reasoning approaches highlight the need for robust approximation strategies and intelligent control techniques.

Reference-contexts: We have been investigating the use of influence diagrams <ref> [Howard and Matheson, 1981] </ref> for representing and solving automated reasoning problems. The influence diagram is an acyclic directed graph containing nodes representing propositions and arcs representing interactions between the nodes. Nodes represent a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive states; arcs capture probabilistic relationships between the nodes.
