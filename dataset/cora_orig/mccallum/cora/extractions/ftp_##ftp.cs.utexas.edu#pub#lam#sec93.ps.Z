Title: A Semantic Model for Authentication Protocols  
Author: Thomas Y.C. Woo Simon S. Lam 
Address: Austin, Texas 78712-1188  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Sciences The University of Texas at Austin  
Abstract: We specify authentication protocols as formal objects with precise syntax and semantics, and define a semantic model that characterizes protocol executions. We have identified two basic types of correctness properties, namely, correspondence and secrecy, that underlie the correctness concerns of authentication protocols. We define assertions for specifying these properties, and a formal semantics for their satisfaction in the semantic model. The Otway-Rees protocol is used to illustrate the semantic model and the basic correctness properties.

Reference-contexts: The informal explanation was widely misunderstood and led directly to the criticism by Nessett in [21]. In fact, the precise meaning of "P k only became clear with the publication of a new semantics for BAN logic in <ref> [2] </ref>. Furthermore, with an insufficiently formalized notion of correctness, it is difficult to judge the generality of a proposed analysis approach. In particular, the questions of soundness and completeness cannot be answered. The goal of our research is to address these two shortcomings. <p> Our secrecy assertions can be used to express unobtainability, while our correspondence assertions are flexible and can be customized for individual protocols. Another major class of formal analysis approaches is based on the use of formal logic. This includes BAN logic <ref> [2, 6] </ref> and its extensions [10, 11], Syverson's KPL [23] and Bieber's logic [4]. Kemmerer's approach [12] can also be included here as it is formalized using a first order logic. <p> Thus we trade abstraction for concreteness. We gain by being able to focus more concretely on some specialized properties, and we lose in expressive power and the ability to capture certain notions (e.g. trust). A formal semantic model was defined for BAN logic in <ref> [2] </ref>. However, the model is intended more for explaining the constructs in the logic than as a basis for a general formalization of correctness. Lastly, the primary focus of BAN logic is on authentication concerns while secrecy concerns are left implicit [6, p. 2].

(However, we conjecture that a protocol satisfying an appropriate set of correspondence and secrecy properties would also satisfy some of the goals suggested in <ref> [6, p. 12] </ref>.) In general, the constructs in BAN logic and our assertions are not comparable. For example, the control construct is not expressible in our model, as our model does not address trust issues. <p> We find idealization undesirable because of the potentially large semantic gap that exists between the original protocol and the idealized version (see for example the idealization of the Yahalom protocol in <ref> [6, pp. 29-30] </ref>). Our specifications are concrete algebraic programs. Thus we trade abstraction for concreteness.

In fact, the first well-publicized authentication protocol failure is concerned with a combination of replay attack and compromise of old keys <ref> [7] </ref>. In light of this, it seems that the timeliness of an authentication exchange ought to be included as a basic correctness property. For example, BAN logic includes a special freshness construct to distinguish information that belongs to the current session. In our approach, this is not necessary. <p> This is possible in part because of our correspondence definition and the introduction of an explicit action GetSecret to model the compromise of old secrets (see discussion in Section 3). For example, the failure reported in <ref> [7] </ref> is in fact a correspondence failure due to the inability of one of the principals to ensure timeliness. Thus in our approach, we do not have timeliness as a basic correctness property.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Authentication is a fundamental concern in the design of secure distributed systems <ref> [14, 25] </ref>. In distributed systems, authentication is typically carried out by protocols, called authentication protocols. The primary goal of an authentication protocol is to establish the identities of the parties (referred to as principals in the security literature) who participate in the protocol.

We choose the Otway-Rees protocol <ref> [22] </ref> for this purpose. The protocol has a standard cast, consisting of two mutually authenticating principals and a third commonly trusted principal. The protocol is intended to achieve the two goals described in Section 2.1: mutual authentication and key distribution.

This includes BAN logic [2, 6] and its extensions [10, 11], Syverson's KPL <ref> [23] </ref> and Bieber's logic [4]. Kemmerer's approach [12] can also be included here as it is formalized using a first order logic. Most of these approaches (except Kem-merer's) are based on the use of some sort of modal logic of belief or knowledge with a possible worlds semantics. <p> Lastly, the primary focus of BAN logic is on authentication concerns while secrecy concerns are left implicit [6, p. 2]. Our approach treats both kinds of concerns explicitly.

He gave similar observations on potential misinterpretations when correctness no tions are insufficiently formalized. 14 Finally, we would like to mention the work by Millen et. al.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Authentication is a fundamental concern in the design of secure distributed systems <ref> [14, 25] </ref>. In distributed systems, authentication is typically carried out by protocols, called authentication protocols. The primary goal of an authentication protocol is to establish the identities of the parties (referred to as principals in the security literature) who participate in the protocol. <p> Recently, a great deal of research has been directed to remedy these two problems. With respect to (i), basic design principles corresponding to symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystems are discussed in <ref> [25] </ref>, and the design of a family of authentication protocols is systematically demonstrated in [5]. With respect to (ii), many formal approaches have been proposed for the analysis of authentication protocols [4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 17, 23]. There are, however, two shortcomings in existing formal analysis approaches.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we present a formalization of correspondence and secrecy properties introduced informally in Section 2.1. A complete presentation, with extended syntax and additional assertion types, can be found in <ref> [26] </ref>. The following presentation is intended to illustrate the essential ideas and general flavor of our approach. 4.1 Correspondence Correspondence properties are specified using correspondence assertions. We first consider the ground case, and then extend our definition to the general case. <p> Then satisfies if for all execution ~ 2 , ~ satisfies . 2 11 Strictly speaking, this is true only for correspondence assertions whose left and right hand sides contain the same set of variables. The semantics is different if this is not the case. See <ref> [26] </ref> for details. 4.2 Secrecy The secrecy specification of an authentication protocol can be divided into two parts: a general part and a specific part. The general part applies to all protocol specifications while the specific part is customized for each authentication protocol.
