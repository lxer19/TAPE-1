Title: Tartan Threads A Method for the Real-time Digital Recognition of Secure Documents in InkJet Printers  
Author: Fernando J. Paiz 
Abstract: Recent advances in the technology for inkjet printers and scanners have created a new way for computer users to inexpensively create high-quality color reproductions of any original document. One obvious problem which arises from these advances is the ability of casual users to create counterfeit currency which looks real enough to fool anyone who does not carefully inspect it. In order to deter such potential counterfeiters, I propose to research the embedding of a digital signature into several threads of pixels of a secure document which can be recognized by an inkjet printer as it prints. If a secure document is recognized, the printer can refuse to complete the print job and issue an appropriate warning to the user. For this technique to serve as a viable solution, however, it must provide a high level of security and require only extremely inexpensive hardware additions to the printers to perform the signature recognition. I propose to develop a complete implementation of Tartan Threads encoding and recognition and subsequently reevaluate its ability to address the casual counterfeiting problem.

Reference-contexts: This research is being conducted in conjunction with other research work at the Media Laboratory for a system called Patch Track which would allow the printers to mark continuos-tone print outs with a unique digital signature which can later be traced to their serial numbers <ref> [1] </ref>. With this combined work, it should be possible to provide the same level of copy protection extant in color copiers to future generations of PC printers.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently the U.S. Secret Service Counterfeit Division reported that in their 1997 fiscal year, 19 percent of the $40 million worth of counterfeit U.S. currency seized domestically was produced on inkjet printers <ref> [4] </ref>. This number represents an 805 percent increase from the percentage of counterfeiters using inkjet printers in 1995. As inkjet printing has improved and grown less expensive, the problem of inkjet counterfeiting has steadily increased. <p> With 1200dpi and higher quality printers heading for the mainstream consumer market in coming years, this problem will only get more serious. Already, of the counterfeit currency seized in 1998, Inkjet printers account for 43 percent <ref> [4] </ref>. The U.S. Treasury Department has taken several measures to deal with modern imaging technologies since the 1970s when color photocopiers were first introduced. Specifically, most color photocopiers in the United States today contain circuitry that attempts to recognize if the original to be copied is a bill.
