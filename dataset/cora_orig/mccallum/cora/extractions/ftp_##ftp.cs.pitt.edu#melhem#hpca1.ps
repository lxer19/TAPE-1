Abstract: A physical link can be time-multiplexed to create several time slots, each of which corresponding to a virtual link. A conventional approach establishes a connection along a path using a set of independent time slots (or virtual links) and thus requires the use of switching devices capable of interchanging time slots. This paper proposes a different approach to all-optical Time Division Multiplexed (TDM) communications in multiprocessor systems. The idea is to establish a connection along a path using a set of time slots (or virtual links) that are dependent on each other, so that no time-slot interchanging is required. It is found that, despite of the possibility that establishing a connection may take a longer time, the proposed approach will result in lower overall communication latency as it eliminates the delays introduced by the time-slot interchanging switching devices.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we describe a new multiplexing approach for establishing all-optical connections in multiprocessor systems and compare it with a conventional multiplexing approach. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe the general concept of establishing connections in multiplexed dynamic and direct networks <ref> [17] </ref>. In such networks, each link is time multiplexed with multiple time slots (i.e. virtual links) and a connection is established during a set of time slots, one on each link that forms a path. Section 3 describes a conventional approach which we call Link Multiplexing (or LM).
