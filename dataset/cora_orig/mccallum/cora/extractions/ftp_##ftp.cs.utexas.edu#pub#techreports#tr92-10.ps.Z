Reference-contexts: The bottom element (?) of this domain is <ref> [1; +1] </ref>. 2 Example 2: Consider a multi-resolution raster image primitive type, with five distinct levels of resolution. <p> For instance, the set fAlice, Bob, Carlag could be approximated by the consistent set fAlice, Bobg and the complete set fAlice, Bob, Carla, Dan, Jog. This idea was used in [2] to construct a consistent semantics for complex objects <ref> [1] </ref> and to present a very expressive approximate query system.

Reference-contexts: Some similar means of constructing a multi-resolution partial order of sets (or relations) is required because sets are essential to most data models, including the relational. Furthermore, sets with many members are large, and hence expensive. This is a surprisingly interesting problem <ref> [2, 3, 5, 6, 12] </ref>. An approach to approximating a set of total data elements from a partially ordered set has been suggested in [2], where the authors have introduced the sandwich concept. A sandwich describes a set B of total elements by "sandwiching" them between two sets. <p> Furthermore, sets with many members are large, and hence expensive.

The sandbag concept extends that work because it is a more expressive partially ordered set construct.

Reference-contexts: The compactness of such a sandbag, as well as its precision, depends on the information it contains and its implementation. The sandbag can represent the fact that a tuple x is a maybe tuple <ref> [4, 12] </ref> in a relation, if mina:x = 0 and maxa:x = 1. The maybe tuple is closely related to the sandwich and the I-table [6]. Both provide a means of stating that the tuples in a relation cannot be excluded but are not known to be in the set.

Reference-contexts: This problem can sometimes be addressed by retrieving low-resolution data quickly or before a deadline. The similar idea of imprecise computation has been suggested as an approach to meeting real-time 3 constraints on database queries <ref> [5, 6, 29, 30, 31] </ref>.

In contrast, this idea was used in <ref> [5] </ref> to construct a query system that exhibits progressive refinement, which is more in the spirit of this paper. 4.1 The Sandbag Scheme Because the sandwich construct cannot capture information about cardinality, we extend the sandwich to a new partial set construct, called the sandbag.

We choose to tolerate this disadvantage, for two reasons. Most importantly, any implementation based on our approach to constructing sandbags described in [22] must immediately sacrifice the Completeness Property (Property 2), because calculating the optimal mina and maxa values is NP-hard for that approach.

Reference-contexts: We call a system that can produce approximations as well as complete data a multi-resolution data retrieval system. The term multi-resolution is borrowed from graphics, but we apply it to all kinds of data. Many applications of growing importance <ref> [15] </ref> manipulate huge quantities of data. These include multimedia databases, voice-mail systems, image processing applications, HDTV, graphics applications such as CAD/CAM, flight simulators, and virtual reality systems, geographic [16] and astronomic databases [17], and scientific applications such as seismic processing.

The enormous volume of data in astronomy, ecology, meteorology, geology, and geography <ref> [16] </ref> databanks could be better exploited by database technology that systematically and conveniently supports resolution control. Systematically treating smaller versions of very large data items is a first step towards the difficult problems of terabyte-sized databases of any kind of data, from images to financial data.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in Section 6 we briefly mention some of the future work that needs to be accomplished in order to usefully implement and exploit this data model. We address the implementation and computational complexity of sandbag operations and provide algorithms in <ref> [22] </ref>. Such issues are outside the scope of this paper and not discussed further here. The proofs of all theorems stated in this paper appear in a technical report [23]. 2 Why Multi-Resolution Multi-resolution is the concept of viewing data at different levels of information content. <p> Although these definitions are not constructive, nevertheless there exist reasonably efficient implementations of these operations that sacrifice the Completeness Property to gain speed <ref> [22] </ref>. 5.2 The Multi-resolution data model The MR relational operators (" 0 , [ 0 , 0 , fi 0 , 0 , 0 , and 1 0 ) form a query language over MR relations analogous to the relational algebra. <p> Incompleteness is a disadvantage that appears to be a fundamental problem of approaches that do not preserve identity, such as [6]. [7, 13] discuss this problem. We choose to tolerate this disadvantage, for two reasons. Most importantly, any implementation based on our approach to constructing sandbags described in <ref> [22] </ref> must immediately sacrifice the Completeness Property (Property 2), because calculating the optimal mina and maxa values is NP-hard for that approach. Secondly, we suspect that this incompleteness has little impact on our overall purpose of supporting the resolution/performance tradeoff. <p> We are in the process of developing efficient algorithms to implement the sandbag and the sandbag operations <ref> [22] </ref>. Two other goals must be met if a useful multi-resolution database management system is to be constructed: 1. A query language extension must be developed that allows the user to conveniently specify the desired resolution of the response to a query.

Reference-contexts: The proofs of all theorems stated in this paper appear in a technical report [23]. 2 Why Multi-Resolution Multi-resolution is the concept of viewing data at different levels of information content. The fields of denotational semantics [11, 14, 24] and information theory <ref> [25, 26, 27, 28] </ref> provide an 2 intuitive and a formal definition of information content and other concepts that underlie multi--resolution (approximation, consistency, resolution, information-theoretic partial order). We repeat the informal definitions of these concepts here to provide the reader the necessary intuitions. Data describes the real world.

Reference-contexts: This problem can sometimes be addressed by retrieving low-resolution data quickly or before a deadline. The similar idea of imprecise computation has been suggested as an approach to meeting real-time 3 constraints on database queries <ref> [5, 6, 29, 30, 31] </ref>. A multi-resolution system naturally extends and complements this approach to real-time databases by supporting larger tradeoffs in imprecision for time.

Reference-contexts: The quadtree representation of raster images is an inherently multi-resolution data structure. Structures such as a bit-striped transposed representation of sets of ordered 15 values <ref> [32, 33] </ref> may allow multi-resolution to be applied to common, built-in types more efficiently. These issues, however, are beyond the scope of this paper.
