Abstract: The development of the nervous system involves in many cases interactions on a local scale rather than the execution of a fully specified genetic blueprint. The problem is to discover the nature of these interactions and the factors on which they depend. The withdrawal of polyinnervation in developing muscle is an example where such competitive interactions play an important role. We examine the possible types of competition in formal

Reference-contexts: This leads naturally to the idea of combining the two types of competition for substance in a single model, as proposed by Bennett & Robinson (1989). We call this type of model a dual constraint model , or DCM. 8 4 Bennett & Robinson's Dual Constraint Model This model <ref> (Bennett & Robinson, 1989) </ref> combines mechanisms of competition for a presynaptic substance with competition for a postsynaptic substance. In the next two sections we show how we have developed this model. We first describe the model, using our own notation. There are N motor neurons and M muscle fibres.

Reference-contexts: In any one muscle the amount of initial innervation ranges from fibre to fibre with very few, if any, uninnervated muscle fibres. The average amount of initial innervation (the mean number of terminals per endplate) varies from 2.7 in the rat lumbrical muscle <ref> (Betz et al., 1979) </ref> to 6.0 in the mouse soleus (Fladby & Jansen, 1988). In the rabbit diaphragm muscle, singly innervated muscle fibres first appear 5 days prenatally, and single innervation is complete 7 days postnatally (Bixby & Van Essen, 1979).

Reference-contexts: Partial denervation experiments where all but a single motor axon were removed were used to investigate whether terminals at singly innervated endplates could be withdrawn, even in the absence of competition from other terminals. One set of experiments on neonatal rat lumbrical muscle <ref> (Betz et al., 1980) </ref> indicated no withdrawal under these conditions.

Reference-contexts: In the rabbit diaphragm muscle, singly innervated muscle fibres first appear 5 days prenatally, and single innervation is complete 7 days postnatally <ref> (Bixby & Van Essen, 1979) </ref>. In rabbit soleus this interval stretches from 3 to 11 days postnatally (Bixby & Van Essen, 1979) and in rat soleus from 9 to 15 days postnatally (Brown et al., 1976). <p> In the rabbit diaphragm muscle, singly innervated muscle fibres first appear 5 days prenatally, and single innervation is complete 7 days postnatally <ref> (Bixby & Van Essen, 1979) </ref>. In rabbit soleus this interval stretches from 3 to 11 days postnatally (Bixby & Van Essen, 1979) and in rat soleus from 9 to 15 days postnatally (Brown et al., 1976). Since in the initial stages 3 terminals can be withdrawn without causing any single innervation, the withdrawal process may start a few days earlier than the onset of single innervation.

The simulation results are close to the experimental data. In the same graph the number of fibres receiving some innervation is plotted.

Reference-contexts: There are also selective effects. When blocked and unblocked motor neurons reinnervate the same muscle, in some cases the unblocked motor units are found to be larger than the blocked ones (Ribchester & Taxt, 1983); in some cases they are smaller <ref> (Callaway et al., 1989) </ref>. Fibre and muscle types There are different types of both motor neurons and muscle fibres, classified according to their preferred frequency of activity.

Reference-contexts: Thus each motor neuron already innervates a fairly homogeneous group of fibres. Rat soleus contains predominantly slow muscle fibres <ref> (Close, 1967) </ref> whereas the rabbit soleus is more inhomogeneous, consisting of 1 3 slow fibres and 2 3 fast fibres (Jansen & Fladby, 1990) and an approximately equal number of slow and fast neurons (Gordon & Van Essen, 1985).

Reference-contexts: Limited number of terminals per axon * Perhaps the clearest indication of this is the result of experiments of partial dener-vation on the neonatal mouse soleus <ref> (Fladby & Jansen, 1987) </ref>. Removal of most of the motor units leads to incomplete innervation in the adult muscle. Under these conditions the average motor unit size is found to be independent of the remaining number of motor units. <p> The spread in motor unit sizes is reduced substantially from ~ 8 to ~ 3. This corresponds to the reduction found experimentally. 6.3 Partial denervation experiments Experiments of partial denervation of rat soleus (Thompson & Jansen, 1977) and mouse soleus <ref> (Fladby & Jansen, 1987) </ref> both concluded that when the muscle was only partially innervated then the size of the motor units was independent of the number of the remaining motor neurons. This size was smaller than the average size in neonatal muscle but larger than the normal adult size.

In rabbit soleus (Gordon & Van Essen, 1985) and mouse soleus <ref> (Fladby & Jansen, 1988) </ref>, motor units are clearly differentiated into fast and slow types even during the initial stage of polyinnervation. Thus each motor neuron already innervates a fairly homogeneous group of fibres.

Reference-contexts: Brown et al. (1976) found that an initial 8-fold spread (defined as the ratio of the size of the largest motor unit to the smallest) was reduced to a 3-fold spread in the mature muscle. In contrast, no such reduction was seen in the rabbit soleus muscle <ref> (Gordon & Van Essen, 1981) </ref>. 2.2 Partial denervation experiments In both neonates and adults, muscles can be partially denervated by removing some of the axons in the motor nerve. This experimental paradigm has been used to investigate the role of various possible mechanisms in the withdrawal of superinnervation.

This means that in rabbit soleus the average size of fast motor units must be twice that of the slow motor units. Topological maps Regional localisation of connections may be involved in determining the pattern of innervation.

Reference-contexts: This is done by removing the equations for terminal nm and decreasing the corresponding -n by one. The tiny amounts of A and B held by the terminal are resorbed into the motor neuron and the muscle endplate respectively. The model proposed by Willshaw (1981) has been criticized <ref> (Gouze et al., 1983) </ref> for the discontinuity introduced when a terminal withdraws. <p> We have argued that issues of implementation (Willshaw, 1981) and of the nature of the experimental results <ref> (Gouze et al., 1983) </ref> make these mechanisms inadequate. The dual constraint model (DCM) due to Bennett and Robinson (1989) employs two types of competition: for a presynaptic substance and for a postsynaptic substance. <p> Sprouting can be thought of as the formation of new terminals into which small amounts of the presynaptic substance A that has not yet been converted to the binding complex C are released. Unlike other models <ref> (Gouze et al., 1983) </ref>, the underlying chemical reactions of DCM are reversible and so the stable endstate of single innervation may not remain stable once sprouting occurs.

Reference-contexts: Survival strengths are weakened according to the total amount of survival strength available at its endplate. This expresses the effect of the digestive enzyme. In this model a presynaptic conservation rule is employed, which expresses the intuition that the total amount of presynaptic resource is limited <ref> (Lichtman, 1977) </ref>. The positive and negative changes applied to the survival strengths are scaled so that the total survival strength assigned to the terminals of each motor neuron stays at a fixed level.

Reference-contexts: During the first few weeks after birth, axons lose some of their terminals until each muscle endplate is innervated by a single terminal (fig 1). A similar pattern of events is found during reinnervation of adult muscle after injury to the motor nerve <ref> (McArdle, 1975) </ref>. (a) Early stage. Several fibres are contacted by more than one terminal. (b) Later stage. Polyinnervation has been withdrawn, leaving all endplates with a single terminal. <p> The same pattern of events occurs during the reinnervation of adult muscle following transection of the nerve <ref> (McArdle, 1975) </ref> and when foreign nerves are transplanted to denervated muscles (Taxt, 1983). 2.1 Normal development Around the time of birth all muscles are multiply innervated, leading to complete single innervation a few days later.

Reference-contexts: The final size of the single motor unit in the rat soleus is seen (fig 5) to be ~ 250.

Partial denervation was introduced by removing one (the lateral plantar nerve) of the two nerves supplying the muscle. The remaining neurons 20 neurons. Muscles were partially denervated at birth, so that only a single motor unit survived in each case.

Reference-contexts: Following damage to the sural nerve, the lateral plantar nerve expands 4 its territory to innervate the entire muscle. On subsequent reinnervation, the sural nerve can reoccupy some of the muscle fibres that became occupied by the intact nerve <ref> (Ribchester & Taxt, 1983) </ref>. The regrowing nerve innervates the endplates that already receive connections from the undamaged axons, and is successful in competing with the intact axons, which gradually retreat. <p> There are also selective effects. When blocked and unblocked motor neurons reinnervate the same muscle, in some cases the unblocked motor units are found to be larger than the blocked ones <ref> (Ribchester & Taxt, 1983) </ref>; in some cases they are smaller (Callaway et al., 1989). Fibre and muscle types There are different types of both motor neurons and muscle fibres, classified according to their preferred frequency of activity.

Reference-contexts: There are N = 25 motor neurons and M = 3500 muscle fibres. The spread in motor unit sizes is reduced substantially from ~ 8 to ~ 3.

Reference-contexts: Perhaps the most straightforward way of expressing a presynaptic sum rule is to assume that each neuron possesses a fixed amount of a certain factor, which is essential for the maintenance of terminals <ref> (Willshaw, 1981) </ref>. A second way is to assume a fixed rate of production of factor, with a limited halflife. This would correspond to a metabolic turnover of substance for each neuron. <p> In other simulations all motor units were initially approximately the same size. Distribution of multiple innervation How should the number of terminals per endplate be distributed? As far as we know, this question has not been addressed experimentally, but theoretical arguments support a random distribution <ref> (Willshaw, 1981) </ref>. We chose the number of terminals at each endplate from a normal distribution with a standard deviation less than the mean. This ensured that nearly all endplates were multiply innervated. <p> We have argued that issues of implementation <ref> (Willshaw, 1981) </ref> and of the nature of the experimental results (Gouze et al., 1983) make these mechanisms inadequate. The dual constraint model (DCM) due to Bennett and Robinson (1989) employs two types of competition: for a presynaptic substance and for a postsynaptic substance.

Reference-contexts: The fate of a terminal depends on other terminals; ie, the mechanism for withdrawal involves competition between terminals. Models invoking competitive mechanisms are well known to theoretical neuroscience. The most common types are those involving competition between the various terminals of each presynaptic neuron <ref> (Willshaw & von der Malsburg, 1979) </ref> or between the terminals connecting each post-synaptic neuron (von der Malsburg, 1973). In most cases, the action of such mechanisms have been expressed as the conservation of some measure of the total amount of synaptic strength available to the neuron on question.
