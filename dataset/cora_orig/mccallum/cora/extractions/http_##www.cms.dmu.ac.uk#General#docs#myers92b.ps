Abstract: This is a revision of technical report CMU-CS-88-107, Tools for Creating User Interfaces: An Introduction and Survey. Abstract User Interface Software is inherently difficult to design and implement. This paper discusses some important reasons why user interface software is more difficult than other types of software, and then surveys the approaches that have been taken to address this problem. Many kinds of tools have been designed to help create user interface software, and these can be classified by the styles of interfaces they create, and the techniques used by the user interface designer to create the software. This paper discusses this taxonomy and a number of tools, both research and commercial, in each category. Finally, current research directions and open issues in the field are discussed. This research was sponsored by the Avionics Laboratory, Wright Research and Development Center, Aeronautical Systems Division (AFSC), U. S. Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH 45433-6543 under Contract F33615-90-C-1465, ARPA Order No. 7597.
