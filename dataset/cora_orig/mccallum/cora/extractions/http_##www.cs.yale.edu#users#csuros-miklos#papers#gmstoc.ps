Title: RECONSTRUCTING EVOLUTIONARY TREES IN A GENERAL MARKOV MODEL  
Author: MIKL OS CS UR OS AND MING-YANG KAO 
Note: (extended abstract submitted to STOC '99)  
Abstract: In this paper we study sequence evolution in a general Markov model that incorporates practically every stochastic model found in the literature. In particular, we study the error in the estimation of evolutionary distances and its dependence on sample sequence lengths. By deriving large deviation results that are applicable to any distance-based evolutionary tree building algorithm, we show that the Harmonic Greedy Triplets and the Short Quartet algorithms recover the evolutionary tree with high probability from sequences of polynomial length in the number of nodes.

Reference-contexts: Notice that if the mutation process is time-reversible or the base frequencies are stationary, then we have det M (XY ) = det M (Y X) and subsequently XY = ln j det M (XY ) j.

If, in addition, the condition of uniform substitution rates is also satisfied, then for any edge e with endpoints X and Y , XY is directly proportional to t e . Remark.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, if X corresponds to the root, then ~ (X) = ~ (0) . 2.2. Less general models. Various additional models can be found in the biology literature, which pose additional requirements on either the edge mutation matrices or the base frequencies. Uniform substitution rates. It is usually <ref> [34, 24, 36, 28] </ref> assumed that the mutations along the edges can be modeled by a Markov process defined by a substitution rate matrix Q so that for each edge e there exists t e &gt; 0 such that M e = exp (Qt e ). t e is a function <p> In this paper we do not make use of uniform substitution rates. Nevertheless, the definition of evolutionary distance in x3.2 provides a convenient tool to obtain the t e values if the assumption holds. Time-reversible mutation process. It is an assumption frequently made <ref> [34, 24, 36] </ref> that the mutation process is time-reversible, i.e., on any edge e with child Y and parent X , for every i; j, M (Y X) [j; i] = M (XY ) [i; j]. <p> Furthermore, the biological data used by Yang showed that this assumption holds and there is no significant advantage gained by omitting it. We analyze statistical efficiency both with and without this assumption. Stationary base frequencies. In this case, one assumes <ref> [34, 24, 36] </ref> that ~ (X) is the same for every node X, and therefore ~ (0) is an eigenvector of every edge mutation matrix M e . This assumption is usually made in conjunction with the assumption of uniform substitution rates and time-reversibility. <p> This assumption is usually made in conjunction with the assumption of uniform substitution rates and time-reversibility. For some biological data (see, e.g., <ref> [24] </ref>), however, this condition is not met. We analyze statistical efficiency both with and without this assumption.

Quartet-based methods <ref> [30, 18, 3, 13] </ref> select a set of quartets (possibly all of them) and by determining their topologies, a hypothesis tree T fl is built. When there exists a tree T fl that is consistent with all the quartet topologies, then it can be found in polynomial time [18, 13].

Reference-contexts: The efficiency limits of such algorithms are well captured by the notion of depth, which we define as follows, similarly to <ref> [31, 12, 13] </ref>. The g-depth of a node in a rooted tree is the smallest number of edges in a path from the node to a leaf. Let e be an edge between nodes u 1 and u 2 in a rooted tree T 0 .

Reference-contexts: When there exists a tree T fl that is consistent with all the quartet topologies, then it can be found in polynomial time [18, 13]. However, if there is no such tree, then finding the optimally fitting tree is NP-hard <ref> [32] </ref>. When the distances are estimated from sample sequences, then the equality of the four point condition can not be expected to hold. For this reason, one uses a relaxed four point condition.

Reference-contexts: The evolutionary tree in biology can be defined as an edge weighted binary tree, in which the nodes correspond to taxa, and edge weights correspond to time of divergence between them <ref> [34] </ref>. Evolution in this model can be viewed as the broadcasting of a character sequence (the root sequence) along the edges from the root towards the leaves. On each edge, the sequence undergoes a certain number of changes or mutations, and the mutated sequences are observed at the leaves. <p> Consequently, statistical efficiency cannot be expected for all evolutionary trees, and computational efficiency can be achieved only by using heuristics to derive approximations to optimal solutions. The class of distance-based algorithms are also widely used <ref> [34] </ref>. These algorithms first calculate pairwise evolutionary distances between taxa from the observed sequences and then build a tree from the resulting distance matrix. Many of these algorithms strive to find an evolutionary tree among all possible trees to fit the observed distances the best according to some metric. <p> Specifically, if X corresponds to the root, then ~ (X) = ~ (0) . 2.2. Less general models. Various additional models can be found in the biology literature, which pose additional requirements on either the edge mutation matrices or the base frequencies.

Nevertheless, the definition of evolutionary distance in x3.2 provides a convenient tool to obtain the t e values if the assumption holds. Time-reversible mutation process. It is an assumption frequently made <ref> [34, 24, 36] </ref> that the mutation process is time-reversible, i.e., on any edge e with child Y and parent X , for every i; j, M (Y X) [j; i] = M (XY ) [i; j]. <p> Furthermore, the biological data used by Yang showed that this assumption holds and there is no significant advantage gained by omitting it. We analyze statistical efficiency both with and without this assumption. Stationary base frequencies. In this case, one assumes <ref> [34, 24, 36] </ref> that ~ (X) is the same for every node X, and therefore ~ (0) is an eigenvector of every edge mutation matrix M e . This assumption is usually made in conjunction with the assumption of uniform substitution rates and time-reversibility. <p> Several models have been proposed (e.g., [22, 25, 35, 20]), mostly for DNA/RNA alphabets, in which the edge mutation matrices are determined by fewer parameters.
