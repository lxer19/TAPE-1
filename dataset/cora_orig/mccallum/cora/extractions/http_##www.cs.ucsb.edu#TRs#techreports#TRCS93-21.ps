Abstract: Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) under the Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS) context require efficient information retrieval and updating in a dynamic environment and at different geographical scales. Some problems in ATIS can be solved based on the functionalities provided by GIS systems. However, extra requirements such as real-time response are not readily met in existing GIS systems. We investigate the use of GIS-based systems for applications in ATIS and we propose a new system architecture based on existing GIS technology and distributed computing technology. Issues on data modeling, data representation, storage and retrieval, data aggregation, and parallel processing of on-line queries in the proposed GIS-based systems are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Sequential execution of queries guarantee correctness. In the above example, after a certain number of queries are executed, the 11 best alternative route may become fi. A commonly used correctness condition for a multi-user database is the serializability of transactions <ref> [Pap79, BHG87] </ref>. This calls for the property of as if sequential execution of transactions. For most updates in an ATIS database, serializability can be enforced by either the two phase locking rule [EGLT76], or the time stamp ordering rule [Ree78].

Reference-contexts: This may provide a better interface to users and enhance multi-level spatial modeling. In view of the demanding computation for answering queries in ATIS, especially routing problems like the traveling salesman problem (TSP), parallel computing is regarded as one solution. Chang et. al. <ref> [CM93] </ref> presented a traffic network simulation model for real-time applications in ATIS. The proposed simulation model is implemented on a parallel computer for an efficient 2 cost/performance ratio. Their model is implemented with a parallel data structure design and a parallel logic.

Reference-contexts: A commonly used correctness condition for a multi-user database is the serializability of transactions [Pap79, BHG87]. This calls for the property of as if sequential execution of transactions. For most updates in an ATIS database, serializability can be enforced by either the two phase locking rule <ref> [EGLT76] </ref>, or the time stamp ordering rule [Ree78]. In the context of the above query/update situation, where we do not require an absolutely shortest alternative route, it is possible to relax the correctness condition of serializability to bounded ignorance [KB91] or bounded inconsistency [WA92].

Reference-contexts: The commonly used GIS data models, however, are not without problem. For example, the raster data model divides space into regularly shaped and sized pixels, whereas the topological data model subdivides space into irregularly shaped regions, links and nodes <ref> [Fra92] </ref>. None of them, however, represents traffic movement and interaction very well and the problem of connectivity is not taken into account.

Reference-contexts: The problem of finding a guideline to tour around a city subject to a list of requirements is a generalization of the TSP. The TSP is an extremely difficult problem (NP-complete) <ref> [GJ79] </ref> to be solved efficiently. Heuristics are usually adopted to generate solutions that are close to optimal in a reasonable amount of time.

Reference-contexts: GIS is also highly flexible in manipulating spatial objects and distance according to rules, and different scenarios can be simulated to test the "what-if " cases. GIS operations can help to define individuals' spatial and temporal constraints of accessibility <ref> [GKG93] </ref>. The commonly used GIS data models, however, are not without problem. For example, the raster data model divides space into regularly shaped and sized pixels, whereas the topological data model subdivides space into irregularly shaped regions, links and nodes [Fra92].

Reference-contexts: Information may need to be transmitted between different levels of modeling. A more efficient data model that overcomes the above problems is needed. Object-oriented data modeling as an alternative for spatial databases was discussed by Wor-boys [Wor90] and Herring [Her92]. Gahegan and Roberts <ref> [GR88] </ref> suggested an intelligent, object-oriented GIS, which is concerned with increasing the functionality and efficiency of the object-centered approach, and hence increasing the effectiveness of GIS as an aid to analysis and decision-making. However, none of the above has been applied in an ATIS context.

Reference-contexts: Their model is implemented with a parallel data structure design and a parallel logic. Preliminary research results show that the running time varies with different levels of model complexities but the parallel simulation methodologies offer a promising alternative in implementing real-time ATIS applications. Furthermore, Imielinski and Badrinath <ref> [IB92] </ref> discussed the use of mobile computers in distributed systems. However, as far as we know, the use of mobile computers in the area of ATIS has not been investigated. In ATIS, information provided to travelers may be affected by decisions made by others in the system.

Reference-contexts: In the context of the above query/update situation, where we do not require an absolutely shortest alternative route, it is possible to relax the correctness condition of serializability to bounded ignorance <ref> [KB91] </ref> or bounded inconsistency [WA92]. This allows a greater degree of concurrency and better performance. A variation of such relaxed correctness condition is used in our system. We would like to bound the error E i in the estimated routing time for each transaction i (or query in our system).

Reference-contexts: Interrelated decisions for pre-trip planners include the decisions by household members. For enroute travelers, decisions made by other drivers in the system would affect predicted traffic conditions. As a result, some form of consistency control is needed. Kaysi et. al. <ref> [KBAK93] </ref> suggested a consistency check in the system design. However, the consistency issue is not directly dealt with in the database design. In addition to the quality of traffic information provided to travelers, the assurance of privacy is also important and should be integrated in the design of the database.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, queries requesting for this information (such as the query requesting for the graphical display of the congestion levels of a certain district) can be served with a smaller amount of data communication. A wide variety of point based interpolation methods such as moving average, Fourier analysis, and stochastic <ref> [Lam93] </ref> exist. For the purpose of interpolating congestion levels, which is the best method is still an open question. To illustrate the idea of temporal data aggregation of dynamic information, consider the problem of the processing of a query from a pre-trip planner.

Reference-contexts: We usually do not think of the street network as segments of links with intersection, but more as the street as a whole. As such, the topological data model is not a natural navigable database. Research on the Ontario Standard Labeled Road Network by Noronha and Goodchild <ref> [NG92] </ref> aims to overcome the above problems. However, it does not deal with area objects that associated with the street network. Moreover, how to represent and process multi-level transportation networks for micro-macro spatial modeling is still a technical issue needed to be solved [Nye90].

Reference-contexts: However, it does not deal with area objects that associated with the street network. Moreover, how to represent and process multi-level transportation networks for micro-macro spatial modeling is still a technical issue needed to be solved <ref> [Nye90] </ref>. IVHS applications require operations at both regional level and local level. Information may need to be transmitted between different levels of modeling. A more efficient data model that overcomes the above problems is needed.

Reference-contexts: The technique of cryptography can be used to maintain full accounting information without compromising privacy. We propose to employ a public key encryption scheme, such as the RSA scheme <ref> [RSA78] </ref>. There are distinct functions associated with each customer: an encryption function E (P ) and a decryption function D (P ) for a piece of information P . The pair of functions must satisfy D (E (P )) = E (D (P )) = P for any P .
