Title: Integrating Natural Language Understanding and Plan Reasoning in the TRAINS-93 Conversation System  
Author: D. R. Traum J. F. Allen G. Ferguson P. A. Heeman C. H. Hwang T. Kato N. Martin M. Poesio and L. K. Schubert 
Abstract: This paper describes the TRAINS-93 Conversation System, an implemented system that acts as an intelligent planning assistant and converses with the user in natural language. The architecture of the system is described and particular attention is paid to the interactions between the language understanding and plan reasoning components. We examine how these two tasks constrain and inform each other in an integrated nl-based system.

Reference-contexts: 1 The TRAINS Project The TRAINS project is a long-term research project to develop an intelligent planning assistant that is conversationally proficient in natural language <ref> [ Allen and Schubert, 1991 ] </ref> . The TRAINS system helps a user construct and monitor plans about a railroad freight system.

Reference-contexts: Since these assumptions often drive the dialogue, we are developing an explicit representation of plans as arguments based on assumptions <ref> [ Ferguson, 1992 ] </ref> . The TRAINS plan reasoner supports interleaved planning and recognition (as necessary in processing dialogue), and exports a variety of functions to other modules of the system, in particular the dialogue manager.

Reference-contexts: have the consequences anticipated. 2.8 NL Generation The NL Generator takes speech act representations produced by the dialogue manager and converts them to natural language text which is then uttered as output to the user (and fed back through the language analysis modules). 3 Example Dialogue of the study in <ref> [ Gross et al., 1993 ] </ref> , in which a person played the part of the system. The dialogue concerns the TRAINS world situation given in Figure 1.

Reference-contexts: Each rule in the grammar consists of a syntactic rule coupled with a corresponding semantic rule. This allows us to build the interpretation compositionally in the sense of Montague's semantics. The computed representation is an unscoped logical form (ULF) in Episodic Logic <ref> [ Hwang and Schubert, 1993 ] </ref> . Episodic logic is a very expressive knowledge and semantic representation which is capable of representing the nuances of a natural language, including tense and aspect, purposes, goals and plans, causes, facts, beliefs, surface speech acts, and various kinds of adverbials.

Reference-contexts: The executor gathers information by observing events in the world and inferring the type of events that caused the observation. It then updates the statistics on the events observed and the events inferred. The principles behind the executor's operation are described in more detail in <ref> [ Martin, 1993 ] </ref> . 2.7 TRAINS World Simulation The TRAINS World is a detailed simulation of action executions by agents on world objects. It is used for plan execution and monitoring (since, as far as the system is concerned, it is the real world).

Reference-contexts: SAD-93 arrives at an hypothesis by applying discourse interpretation rules with varying strength, all of which operate directly off the underspecified interpretation. The decision to integrate scope interpretation with other aspects of pragmatic interpretation reflects the thesis put forth in <ref> [ Poesio, 1994 ] </ref> that the scoping preferences of human subjects result from the interaction of several discourse interpretation processes. 2.3 Speech Act Analysis The speech act interpreter is responsible for determining what the speaker means by her utterance.

Reference-contexts: The dialogue manager is described in more detail in <ref> [ Traum, 1993 ] </ref> . 2.5 Domain Plan Reasoning The plan reasoner provides planning and plan recognition services and performs reasoning about the state of the world.
