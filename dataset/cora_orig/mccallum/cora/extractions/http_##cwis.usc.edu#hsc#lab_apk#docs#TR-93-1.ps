Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Despite the introduction of several new classes of antimicrobial agents, the aminoglycoside antibiotics are still recognized as first line therapeutic agents in the management of severe Gram-negative sepsis <ref> [1] </ref>. It has been shown in several studies that the peak serum concentrations achieved with aminoglycoside therapy correlate with therapeutic response and outcome [2,3]. Toxicity of these agents is determined primarily by the accumulation of the drug in the body [4].

Reference-contexts: It has been shown in several studies that the peak serum concentrations achieved with aminoglycoside therapy correlate with therapeutic response and outcome [2,3]. Toxicity of these agents is determined primarily by the accumulation of the drug in the body <ref> [4] </ref>. Wide intra- and inter-individual variability of the pharmacokinetic parameter values of these antibiotics make the design of optimal dosage regimens difficult for patients with normal or impaired renal function [5-7]. Aminoglycoside use has been limited by its potential ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity [8].

Reference-contexts: Monitoring of aminoglycoside therapy can be performed with several different methodologies: 1. Measuring Serum Drug Concentrations: When used without appropriate expertise or software for drug concentration interpretation and modeling, therapeutic drug monitoring based only on raw data of serum concentrations is often ineffective <ref> [17] </ref>. 2. Predictive nomograms [23,24]. 3. Linear least squares regression [25]. 4. Nonlinear least squares regression [26]. 5. Maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) Bayesian fitting [27,28]. For aminoglycoside therapy, the MAP Bayesian method is a rapid and accurate mean of individualizing dosage requirements for patients with diverse pharmacokinetic profiles [29].

Prediction (and therefore control) of subsequent aminoglycoside serum levels is more precise with Bayesian than with the other methods above [28,30-32]. Moreover, the Bayesian technique has the advantage of requiring fewer (as few as one) serum concentration measurements [33].
