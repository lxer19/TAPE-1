Reference-contexts: In this paper, we address some of the challenges of turning the Internet into a true integrated services digital network or full service network that can carry traditional Internet services as well as telecommunication services such as telephony and distribution services such as radio and television. A related paper <ref> [5] </ref> contains additional data. We will emphasize two related kinds of services, namely continuous-media services delivering continuous streams of multimedia data, such as streaming audio and video, and a subclass of continuous-media, real-time services, which 1 adds end-to-end delay requirements.

The resource reservation protocol proposed for the Internet (RSVP <ref> [11] </ref>) offers advantages such as several different reservation styles, receiver-orientation and avoidance of orphan reservations, but because of its soft-state mechanism, does not support flows requiring assured reservations.

Reference-contexts: Rather than sharing a common network layer, the DAVIC consortium has proposed a vertical architecture, where MPEG content delivery takes place over a variety of media, such as ATM, hybrid fiber-coax or even IP. Control and data services may be carried as MPEG 2 transport stream packets <ref> [15] </ref>, using a variety of RPC mechanisms such as DCE and CORBA. In the author's opinion, this application-centric approach is architecturally flawed, as it imposes complexity 2 for each new service and exposes applications to the details of the underlying network.

Reference-contexts: This would make reservations and itemized billing unnecessary for most purposes. At least in the United States, telephone access charges are becoming more and more independent of time-of-day and distance <ref> [18] </ref>, approaching flat per-minute fees, with some providers even offering unlimited business service for one day of the week. Unlike phone service, however, it would be easy to simply, say, let the Internet media-on-demand service play, even if there is nobody listening. This could be prevented by volume billing.

Reference-contexts: Commingling TCP and continuous-media traffic within the same queues, whether they operate in tail-drop or random-early drop <ref> [19] </ref> mode, appears to be sub-optimal, as the deep queues necessary for decent TCP performance lead to long and highly variable queueing delays for continuous-media traffic.

Reference-contexts: Early ATM performance papers assumed that video and audio services would require cell loss rates of 10 12 to 10 9 .

Reference-contexts: For real-time packet audio services, the IPv6 header of 40 bytes, even without security extensions, imposes a significant additional cost.

As the web is becoming the universal user interface <ref> [29] </ref> to operating systems and network devices, how to extend trust to applications residing on remote systems becomes more of an issue, as the simple local/remote distinction becomes less useful.
