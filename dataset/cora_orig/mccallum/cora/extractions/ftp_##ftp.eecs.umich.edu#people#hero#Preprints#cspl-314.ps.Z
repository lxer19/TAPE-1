Abstract: Let X n = fx 1 ; : : : ; x n g, be an i.i.d. sample having mul-tivariate distribution P on [0; 1] d . We derive a.s. limits for the power weighted edge weight function of greedy approximations to a class of minimal graphs spanning k of the n samples. The class includes all minimal k-point graphs constructed by the potential function partitioning method of Ravi, Sundaram, Marathe, Rosenkrantz and Ravi [1] where the edge weight function satisfies the quasi-additive property of Redmond and Yukich [2]. This includes greedy approximations to the k-point minimal spanning tree (k-MST), Steiner tree (k-ST), and the traveling salesman problem (k-TSP). An expression for the influence curve (IC) of the minimal weight function is given which characterizes sensitivity of the greedy algorithm to small perturbations in the underlying distribution. The form of the IC indicates that the weight function has robustness properties in IR d which are analogous to those of rank order statistics in one dimension. We also show that the log of the minimum weight function is a robust estimator of the Renyi entropy of order -, where - 2 (0; 1) is a function of the sample space dimension and the edge weight power exponent.

Reference-contexts: The class includes all minimal k-point graphs constructed by the potential function partitioning method of Ravi, Sundaram, Marathe, Rosenkrantz and Ravi <ref> [1] </ref> where the edge weight function satisfies the quasi-additive prop erty of Redmond and Yukich [2]. <p> A polynomial time greedy algorithm for constructing an approximation to the minimal k-point graph and its edge weight function is presented which is a direct generalization of the algorithm of Ravi, Sundaram, Marathe, Rosenkrantz and Ravi <ref> [1] </ref> developed therein for minimal k-point minimum spanning tree approximation on the plane. 2. <p> Additional smoothness assumptions on f will be required and will be given in the sequel. To simplify certain mathematical technicalities we will assume that the distribution is supported on the unit cube <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d . Any finitely supported distribution can be mapped to this domain by invertible linear transformation. Although we do not prove it, the restriction to finite support can undoubtedly be relaxed for densities satisfying the tail decay bounds of [22]. A. <p> B. Quasiadditive Euclidean Functionals Let F be a finite subset of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d , i.e. a set of points. Define the following conditions on a real valued set function L [2], [21]: Null Condition: L () = 0, where is the null set. <p> Subadditivity: There exists a constant C 1 with the following property: If Q m = fQ i g m d i=1 is a uniform partition of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d into m d cubes Q i each of edge length m 1 and volume m d and if fq i g im d is the set of points in [0; 1] d which translate each Q i back to the origin such that Q i q i = <p> the following property: If Q m = fQ i g m d i=1 is a uniform partition of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d into m d cubes Q i each of edge length m 1 and volume m d and if fq i g im d is the set of points in [0; 1] d which translate each Q i back to the origin such that Q i q i = m 1 [0; 1] d , then L (F ) m m d i=1 dfl Superadditivity: There exists a constant C 2 with the fol lowing property: L (F ) m m <p> into m d cubes Q i each of edge length m 1 and volume m d and if fq i g im d is the set of points in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d which translate each Q i back to the origin such that Q i q i = m 1 [0; 1] d , then L (F ) m m d i=1 dfl Superadditivity: There exists a constant C 2 with the fol lowing property: L (F ) m m d i=1 Continuity: There exists a constant C 3 such that for all finite subsets F and G of [0; 1] <p> 1 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d , then L (F ) m m d i=1 dfl Superadditivity: There exists a constant C 2 with the fol lowing property: L (F ) m m d i=1 Continuity: There exists a constant C 3 such that for all finite subsets F and G of [0; 1] d jL (F [ G) L (F )j C 3 (card (G)) (dfl)=d L is said to be a continuous subadditive functional if it satisfies the null condition, subadditivity and continuity. <p> (F ) and the approximation property jE [L (U 1 ; : : : ; U n )] E [L (U 1 ; : : : ; U n )]j C 4 n (3) where U 1 ; : : : ; U n are i.i.d. uniform random vectors in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d . When such a functional L fl exists it is called the dual of L. As shown in Redmond and Yukich [2, Thm. 1.3] and [21, Thm 2.3] duals can frequently be constructed by identifying a related boundary rooted graph over X n . <p> The following theorem is proven 2 in [21]. Theorem 1: Let L be a quasi-additive Euclidean functional with power-exponent fl, and let X n = fx 1 ; : : : ; x n g be an i.i.d. sample drawn from a distribution on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d with an absolutely continuous component having (Lebesgue) density f (x). Then (4) n!1 (dfl)=d Z (dfl)=d In Theorem 1 fi L;fl is a constant which only depends on fl and the definition of the functional L, i.e. the graph optimality crite rion (TSP, MST, or Steiner tree). <p> Hence, the elegant methods of Steele [23], Redmond and Yukich [2], and Rhee [35] cannot be directly applied. A. A Tight Cover Property Let Q m be a uniform partition of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d into m d cubes Q i of edge length 1=m. The quantity 1=m is called the resolution of the partition. <p> Definition 2 (Tightly Coverable Graphs) Let Q m , m = 1; 2; : : :, be a sequence of uniform partitions of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d of resolution 1=m and let (Q m ) denote the sigma-algebra generated by the partition cells in Q m . Let G n be the complete graph span ning X n . For ff 2 [0; 1] let G be an algorithm which constructs a subgraph of G <p> 1; 2; : : :, be a sequence of uniform partitions of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d of resolution 1=m and let (Q m ) denote the sigma-algebra generated by the partition cells in Q m . Let G n be the complete graph span ning X n . For ff 2 [0; 1] let G be an algorithm which constructs a subgraph of G n with k = bffnc vertices X n;k X n . Define D m k = " fC2 (Q m ):X n;k 2Cg D the minimum volume partition set which covers X n;k . <p> For an arbitrary distribution of vertices X n , this property would allow us to index X n;k over the n possible combinations of k-point sets of X n by indexing the sets of vertices D " X n over the partition-generated subsets D 2 (Q m ) of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d . B. A Covering Lemma Consider the class (sigma algebra) (Q m ) of sets of resolution 1=m. <p> Here we obtain asymptotic results for a greedy algorithm originally introduced by Ravi, Sundaram, Marathe, Rosenkrantz and Ravi <ref> [1] </ref> for constructing approximations to the k-MST on the plane. Their algorithm produces graphs which by construction satisfy the tightly coverable property introduceed in the last section. <p> Here we define a generalized version of their algorithm which constructs graphs in d dimensions, d &gt; 1, using arbitrary quasi-additive edge weight functions. The algorithm is implemented in three steps: 1) the user specifies a uniform partition Q m of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d having m d cells Q i of resolution 1=m; 2) the algorithm finds the smallest subset B m k = [ i Q i of partition elements containing at least k points; 3) out of this smallest subset the algorithm selects the k points X n;k which minimize <p> The smallest subset mentioned in Stage 2 of the algorithm is not unique. Figures 1 and 2 show an example with m = 5, k = 17 for which there are two possible smallest subsets, in this case both contain 18 points. Similarly to [36], <ref> [1] </ref> we specify a small subset by the following greedy algorithm: i) find a reindexing fQ (i) g m d i=1 of the cells in [0; 1] d ranked in decreasing order of the number of contained points, card (X n " Q (1) ) : : : card (X n <p> Similarly to [36], [1] we specify a small subset by the following greedy algorithm: i) find a reindexing fQ (i) g m d i=1 of the cells in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d ranked in decreasing order of the number of contained points, card (X n " Q (1) ) : : : card (X n " Q (m d ) ) (if there are equalities arrange these in lexicographical order); ii) select the subset specified in Stage 2 by the <p> A sample of 75 points from the mixture density f (x) = 0:25f 1 (x)+ 0:75f o (x) where f o is a uniform density over <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 and f 1 is a bivariate Gaussian density with mean (1=2; 1=2) and diagonal covari ance diag (0:01). A smallest subset B m k is the union of the two cross hatched cells shown for the case of m = 5 and k = 17. Fig. 2. <p> The total variation v (Q) over a rectangle Q <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d of a func tion g on IR d is defined as [37] v (Q) = lim sup X jg (z i ) g (z i1 )j = v (Q); (12) where the limsup is taken over all countable subsets fz 1 ; z 2 ; : : : <p> The main result of this section is the following asymptotic theorem. Theorem 2: Let X n be an i.i.d. sample from a distribution having Lebesgue density f (x). Fix ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, fl 2 (0; d). Let 6 CSPL-314 JULY 1998 f (dfl)=d be of bounded variation over [0; 1] d and denote by v (A) its total variation over a subset A [0; 1] d . <p> The main result of this section is the following asymptotic theorem. Theorem 2: Let X n be an i.i.d. sample from a distribution having Lebesgue density f (x). Fix ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, fl 2 (0; d). Let 6 CSPL-314 JULY 1998 f (dfl)=d be of bounded variation over [0; 1] d and denote by v (A) its total variation over a subset A [0; 1] d . <p> Fix ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, fl 2 (0; d). Let 6 CSPL-314 JULY 1998 f (dfl)=d be of bounded variation over [0; 1] d and denote by v (A) its total variation over a subset A [0; 1] d . <p> Therefore, integrating this inequality over x 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d Z (dfl)=d Z (dfl)=d or A m ff (dfl)=d Z ~ f (x)dx (16) Z ~ f (x)dx A Now, as P (A m ff ) = p A m ff , if P (A) ff then the right side of this inequality is upper bounded by (p <p> Using Lemma 2 and the fact that (A m ) converges to the class of Borel subsets B of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d , it is an easy exercise to show that lim Z f (x)dx = inf Z f (x)dx A2B:P (A)=ff A (dfl)=d Now for any Borel set A in [0; 1] d having P (A) &gt; 0 define the conditional density f (xjA) = f (x)=P (A)I A <p> Lemma 2 and the fact that (A m ) converges to the class of Borel subsets B of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d , it is an easy exercise to show that lim Z f (x)dx = inf Z f (x)dx A2B:P (A)=ff A (dfl)=d Now for any Borel set A in [0; 1] d having P (A) &gt; 0 define the conditional density f (xjA) = f (x)=P (A)I A (x) where I A (x) is the indicator function of A. <p> As 1 - &gt; 0 minimization of R - (f jA) over A is equivalent to minimization of the integral in (18). Let A o be the probability-at-least-ff Borel subset of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d which minimizes R - (f jA) R - (f jA o ) = inf R - (f jA): (19) For - = (d fl)=d define the following function of L (X G m n;bffnc ) ^ R - = 1 - log L (X n;bffnc )=(bffnc) - An <p> BHH limit theorem, Theorem 1, for minimal graphs spanning all n points X n . Indeed, in this case, for arbitrary m &gt; 0 the class A m ff of resolution-1=m probability-at-least-ff sets contains only one set A 1 = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d . Therefore, p A m ff ff = 0, @A m ff = , the empty set, and v (Q i " @A m ff ) = 0 as required. 2. <p> measure be A s and let ff s = s (<ref> [0; 1] </ref> d ) = P (A s ) &lt; ff. Then, we know from Lemma 6 that lim n! L (X n " A s ) = 0 and hence points falling in the singular part A s of [0; 1] d contribute negligible weight. Thus, by the strong law of large numbers, ff s n of the n points can be included in the graph at negligible cost leaving only (ff ff s )n points in [0; 1] d A s whose edge weights are asymptotically significant. <p> 0 and hence points falling in the singular part A s of <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d contribute negligible weight. Thus, by the strong law of large numbers, ff s n of the n points can be included in the graph at negligible cost leaving only (ff ff s )n points in [0; 1] d A s whose edge weights are asymptotically significant. <p> To see this define the Lagrangian (A; ) = A (dfl)=d Z f (x)dx ff for &gt; 0. Consider an arbitrary Borel subset A <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d outside of A o , A o " A = . By Kuhn-Tucker, A o must satisify (A o + A; ) (A o ; ) 0 for A o to minimize (A; ) and hence minimize entropy. <p> Hence, in this case, the conditional density f (xjA o ) in (20) is obtained by truncating f (x) wherever it falls below and renormalizing to obtain a valid probability density integrating to 1 over <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d . See Fig. 3 for illustration. When for any a &gt; 0 the set fx : f (x) = ag has (Lebesgue) measure zero f (x) has no flat spots and it is always possible to select in (22) to satisfy P (A o ) = ff. <p> It is then a simple matter to put Lemmas 5 and 7 together to prove Theorem 2. Lemma 3: For given ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and a set of n i.i.d. points X n = [x 1 ; : : : ; x n ] T let B m n be the minimal cover of bffnc points with resolution-1=m produced by the greedy subset selection al gorithm. <p> 2 ln p 1 =p 2 + (1 p 2 ) ln (1 p 2 )=(1 p 1 ) 0 is the Kullback-Liebler distance between two Bernoulli probability distributions fp 1 ; 1 p 1 g and fp 2 ; 1 p 2 g, p 1 ; p 2 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> The next result relates the error of a blocked distribution ap proximation of R f (dfl)=d (x)dx to the total variation of f .

Then for any quasi-additive functional L n (A) = L (X n " A) lim L n (A)=n (dfl)=d = fi L;fl A Furthermore, the above (a.s.) limit is the pointwise limit of E [L n (A)]=n (dfl)=d as n ! 1. <p> @A m ff ) v (<ref> [0; 1] </ref> d ) and v ([0; 1] d ) &lt; 1, Theorem 2 is established. 2 VI. Examples We first assume that f is a uniform density over the d-dimensional unit sphere S (0; 1) d . It is obvious that for ff 2 [0; 1] a Borel subset A o which minimizes Renyi entropy is A o = x : kxk ff 1 ) and the associated minimum entropy conditional density is f (xjA o ) = 1 0; o:w: By Theorem 2 L (X G m n:bffnc )=n (dfl)=d converges a.s. to a <p> Note that, unlike the previous example, the support of f is IR d which is not compact and cannot be mapped into <ref> [0; 1] </ref> d .

For small s, (1s)P +sffi x o is interpreted as a perturbed distribution resulting from exchanging sn of the n samples x i from distribution P with sn samples from the concentrated distribution ffi x o .
