Reference-contexts: In the latter sections of this document, the learning capabilities and cognitive aspects of Soar are described. This document is not intended to serve as a reference for Soar. Instead, it is meant as a companion to the manual <ref> [ Congdon, 1995 ] </ref> . We will suggest ways to explore Soar and new things to try. We strongly encourage you to make heavy use of the manual to find out the exact syntax for various commands, and to find out new things that you can do with them. <p> This document starts by focussing on the the first viewpoint. After the problem solving aspects of Soar are described, we will introduce the practical aspects of learning and cognitive modeling in Soar. For further information on these and other aspects of Soar, please see these helpful references <ref> [ Congdon, 1995; Laird et al., 1987 ] </ref> .
