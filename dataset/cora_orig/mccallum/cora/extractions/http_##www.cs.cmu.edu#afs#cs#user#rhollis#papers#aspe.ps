Abstract: This short paper outlines new hardware and software technologies and methods being developed for automated assembly of precision high-value products such as magnetic storage devices, palmtop and wearable computers and other high-density equipment. Our Agile Assembly Architecture (AAA) supports the creation of miniature assembly factories (mini-factories) built from small modular robotic components. The goals are to substantially reduce design and deployment times and product changeover times, greatly improve quality levels by using sensor-moderated precision motion, and to achieve new levels of manufacturing system portability by shrinking the sizes of typical assembly systems from large room size to tabletop size. We are developing the key electromechanical elements including novel subproduct couriers, manipulator/feeders, and other modular components. We are implementing a distributed realtime computer architecture, modeling and simulation software, high-level network communication protocol, and graphical programming tools to support this architecture. "Real" minifactories will be programmed by directly interfacing with automatically synchronized "virtual" minifactories.

Reference-contexts: The actuator can be carried by the z actuator (or vice versa), or a two-dimensional cylindrical motor design with a single moving part can be used, e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>. We refer to this robot and its associated feeder as a "manipulator/feeder." The problematic 1 and 2 axes of the scara are discarded in favor of an x; y stage "courier" robot which carries the subassembly.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, this robot is implemented as a two-axis linear motor capable of traveling above a flat platen surface over a large workspace. This robot is also tightly referenced to mechanical ground. Planar motor robotic systems exist commercially, e.g. <ref> [2] </ref>, but these systems essentially imitate the scara configuration. As indicated in Fig. 2, the two robots must execute coordinated motions in order to replace the functionality of the scara.

Reference-contexts: After chemical machining, the platen surface is planarized using epoxy to form the air-bearing surface. We are investigating ac magnetic, and optical fluorescence sensing techniques <ref> [3] </ref>. The magnetic sensor has achieved 1 m position resolution and is compact and easy to fabricate. The optical fluorescence sensor has the advantage of complete insensitivity to nearby motor fields. <p> Solid models of minifactory elements and various minifactory layouts have been developed, allowing us to generate animated sequences which include parts placement on subassemblies carried by couriers. We have invented two position sensing technologies for the planar linear motors that comprise the minifactory couriers <ref> [3] </ref>.
