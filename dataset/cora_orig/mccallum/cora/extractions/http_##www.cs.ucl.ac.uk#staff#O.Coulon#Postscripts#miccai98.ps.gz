Abstract: In this paper, we propose a robust fully non-supervised method dedicated to the segmentation of the brain in T1-weighted MR images. The first step consists in the analysis of the scale-space of the histogram first and second derivative. We show first that the crossings in scale-space of trajectories of extrema of different derivative orders follow regular topological properties. These properties allow us to design a new structural representation of a 1D signal. Then we propose an heuristics using this representation to infer statistics on grey and white matter grey level values from the histogram. These statistics are used by an improved morphological process combining two opening sizes to segment the brain. The method has been validated with 70 images coming from 3 different scanners and acquired with various MR sequences.

Reference-contexts: For instance, finger prints stem from first derivative extrema [16] while blob based primal sketches stem from signal (or Laplacian) extrema [7, 2]. Finger print based analysis has been proposed to ini-tialise the decomposition of 1D signals in mixtures of Gaussians <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. In the case of MR image histograms, the Gaussian hypothesis may appear justified at first glance. In fact such an hypothesis does not take into account partial volume effect, signal non stationarities, Gibbs artefacts, subject motions and other MRI specific artefacts.

The closing effect on the binarization allows us to use a relatively selective low threshold m G 2oe G . This improves the effect of the following erosion and reduces the risk of first order under opening (cf. Fig. 4).

Reference-contexts: such methods when dealing with a wide set of sequence parameters led us to search for a more robust approach. 3.1 Cascades of singularities Linear scale-space analysis is an appealing approach when dealing with 1D signals because of the surprisingly simple geometry of extremum trajectories induced by the causality property <ref> [16, 5] </ref>. Indeed, extrema of the signal and its first derivatives often have direct semantic interpretations, which make them good candidates for deriving structural descriptions. Usual approaches rely only on extrema of one single derivative.

Fig. 2). Various approaches have been proposed to deal with the detection of these modes, including K-means <ref> [6] </ref> and fit with a sum of Gaus sians or with other a priori models [13].

In the case of MR image histograms, the Gaussian hypothesis may appear justified at first glance. <p> Fig. 7). These extinctions, which are the well known singularities related to scale-space bifurcations <ref> [7] </ref>, follow a simple rule giving rise to what we will call singularity cascades. Fig. 7. <p> In non-degenerate situations, an estimate of a D i extremum velocity v i (g; s) (where g denotes the grey level and s denotes the scale) along its trajectory defined by D i+1 (g; s) = 0, is given by the implicit function theorem <ref> [7] </ref>: v i (g; s) = 2 D i+2 (g; s) Hence, a crossing between D i+1 (g; s) = 0 and D i+2 (g; s) = 0 would lead to a degenerate situation where the drift velocity tends to infinity. <p> Fig. 6). The first step of the process consists in computing the scale-space of the histogram first and second derivatives until the first scale where only one second derivative minimum exists. This is done using the usual discretization of heat equation <ref> [7] </ref>. Then all extrema reaching a minimum scale (in practice 5) are tracked from their extinction scale until scale zero. The different trajectories are gathered in families corresponding to the cascade notion. "Maximum/minimum" couples of trajectories of the same order mating in a singularity are detected first.

Reference-contexts: The whole process can be summarized as follows: Apply O s opening to binarization B to get object O s (B) (structuring ele ment: 26-neighbourhood); Apply 3mm erosion to O s (B) (structuring element: 3mm radius ball) <ref> [8] </ref>); Select largest 26-connected component as brain seed S; Compute geodesic chamfer distance to S conditionally to O s (B) (denoted d (S))n; Threshold the previous distance to get brain complement T &gt;8mm (d (S)); Dilate brain complement conditionally to T &gt;4mm (d (S)) until convergence; Removes the dilation result from <p> The largest opening O l is related to the 3mm radius ball structuring element, which is defined from a chamfer distance adapted to the voxel anisotropy <ref> [8] </ref>. This choice makes the opening effect of O l independent of the voxel geometry. The 26-neighborhood has been chosen for O s to assure a minimum opening effect in all directions whatever the voxel geometry is. Geodesic chamfer distances are efficiently implemented using a thick front propagation [14].

First, the few families supposed to include the central D2m trajectories of these signatures will be selected, all other families being removed.

Hence, this method can now be considered as a reliable preprocessing before more sophisticated image analysis approaches.
