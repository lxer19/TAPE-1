Abstract: The order bound on generalized Hamming weights is introduced in a general setting of codes on varieties which comprises both the one point geometric Goppa codes as the q-ary Reed-Muller codes. For the latter codes it is shown that this bound is sharp and that they satisfy the double chain condition.

Reference-contexts: Generalized Hamming weights were introduced in the study [15, 24] on the weight distribution of codes over extensions of F q . The concept was rediscovered in [41] where the problem of the GHW's of the binary RM codes was solved. In <ref> [1] </ref> the GHW's of the ternary RM codes was computed. An equivalent definition was found for projective systems in projective space in [38, 39].

The general case is treated in the Appendix. 2 Theorem 6.8 Let the sequence (fi i ) be associated to the canonical represen tation of r with respect to (u; q 1; m) as in Proposition 6.7. <p> Then d r (RM q (u; m)) = i=1 Proof.

Reference-contexts: This theorem is proved in the binary case in [41, Lemma 6] as a consequence of Theorem 5.5 for q = 2. But since this argument is valid for any q and Theorem 5.5 is true for any q, this theorem is also valid for any q. See also <ref> [2] </ref> where this theorem is proved in the more general setting of so called Macaulay posets. 2 Lemma 5.8 Let r be an integer such that 0 r &lt; q m .

Reference-contexts: Problem 7.1' of [39] is still an open question, that is to say what the GHW's of the projective or nonprimitive RM codes [35, 43] are and whether the above methods also apply to these codes. In <ref> [3] </ref> and [44] the GHW's of the first and second order projective RM codes are computed. In [3] a conjecture is formulated for the GHW's of projective RM codes which is quite similar in spirit to the answer given in Theorem 5.10 for the ordinary RM codes. <p> In <ref> [3] </ref> and [44] the GHW's of the first and second order projective RM codes are computed.
