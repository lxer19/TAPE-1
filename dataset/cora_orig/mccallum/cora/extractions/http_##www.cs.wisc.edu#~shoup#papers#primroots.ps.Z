Abstract: Let GF(p n ) be the finite field with p n elements where p is prime. We consider the problem of how to deterministically generate in polynomial time a subset of GF(p n ) that contains a primitive root, i.e., an element that generates the multiplicative group of nonzero elements in GF(p n ). We present three results. First, we present a solution to this problem for the case where p is small, i.e., p = n O(1) . Second, we present a solution to this problem under the assumption of the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH) for the case where p is large and n = 2. Third, we give a quantitative improvement of a theorem of Wang on the least primitive root for GF(p) assuming the ERH.

Reference-contexts: From these estimates, one can easily derive an upper bound of O ((log p) 2 ) on the least prime that is a quadratic nonresidue (or residue) modulo a prime p. This was first proved by Ankeny <ref> [2] </ref>. The following simple variant of Ankeny's theorem will be useful. Proposition 10. Assume the ERH. Let p be an odd prime. Then there exists a prime q = O ((log p) 2 ) with q 1 (mod 4) such that q is a quadratic nonresidue (or residue) mod p.

Reference-contexts: Assuming the ERH, this theorem implies that one can deterministically construct a q-th nonresidue in GF (p 2 ) for a given prime q dividing p 2 1 in time (log p) O (1) |independent of q. Previous such methods (e.g., <ref> [15, 3] </ref>) required time at least q. One application of this is the following. For integer m, let S (m) denote the largest prime dividing m. <p> It is shown in [27], by refining the algorithm in [31], that assuming the ERH, polynomials of degree d over GF (p) can be factored deterministically in time S (p 1) 1=2 (d log p) O (1) . By combining Theorem 2 with the techniques in [27] and <ref> [3] </ref>, one can prove an analogous result with S (p+1) replacing S (p 1). 3 Our third result is a quantitative improvement of Wang's theorem. <p> We also mention the result of Lenstra [20] that isomorphisms between two different models of a GF (p n ) can be computed in deterministic time (n log p) O (1) (unconditionally).

Reference-contexts: Combining this with (2), the proposition follows. 2 We will make extensive use of characters on finite abelian groups. We summarize the basic facts here (see, e.g., <ref> [4, pp. 415 ff.] </ref>.) Let G be a finite abelian group. A character on G is a homomorphism from G into the complex unit circle. The characters on G form a group under the multiplication law ( 1 2 )(a) = 1 (a) 2 (a).

Reference-contexts: More precisely, Wang shows that x = O (r 6 (log p) 2 ), where r = !(p 1), the number of distinct prime divisors of p 1. Note that for any integer m, !(m) = O (log m= log log m) (see, e.g., <ref> [13, p. 355] </ref>). Thus, if the ERH is true, the deterministic search procedure that simply enumerates the integers 1; 2; 3; etc., will generate a primitive root in polynomial time. We prove three results.

Reference-contexts: Previously known reductions of this type were probabilistic. We note that Shparlinsky <ref> [30, Theorem 2.4] </ref> also gives a deterministic search procedure with running time (np) O (1) ; however, the method described in that paper does not in general construct a set of polynomials of small degree.

Reference-contexts: Previous such methods (e.g., [15, 3]) required time at least q. One application of this is the following. For integer m, let S (m) denote the largest prime dividing m. It is shown in [27], by refining the algorithm in <ref> [31] </ref>, that assuming the ERH, polynomials of degree d over GF (p) can be factored deterministically in time S (p 1) 1=2 (d log p) O (1) . <p> We also mention the result of Lenstra [20] that isomorphisms between two different models of a GF (p n ) can be computed in deterministic time (n log p) O (1) (unconditionally). Also relevant is recent work on factoring polynomials over finite fields <ref> [3, 15, 24, 23, 25, 29, 31] </ref>. 4 Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Eric Bach, Jeff Lagarias, and Andrew Odlyzko for helpful discussions, and Hendrik Lenstra for comments on earlier versions of this paper that led to the simplification of several proofs. 2.

Reference-contexts: However, the existence of a deterministic polynomial time search procedure for primitive roots in an arbitrary finite field is an open question|and it is this question that we address here. An important result in this area is due to Wang <ref> [32] </ref>, who shows that, assuming the Extended Riemann Hypothesis (ERH), there exists a positive integer x = (log p) O (1) such that x mod p is a primitive root for GF (p). <p> Karacuba [18], extending the work of Burgess [5], Wang <ref> [32] </ref>, and Davenport and Lewis [10], proves the existence of a primitive root in GF (p n ) of the form a n1 ff n1 + + a 1 ff + a 0 , where the a i 's are bounded by p 1=4+* (for all * &gt; 0 and all

Reference-contexts: Then by Euler's product formula, we have L (; T ) = L ( 0 ; T ) jf (1 0 ()T deg ); where the product ranges over all monic irreducible that divide f but not g. It follows from the discussion in Appendix V of Weil's book <ref> [33] </ref> that L ( 0 ; T ) = i=1 if 0 is nontrivial on F , and otherwise L ( 0 ; T ) = (1 T ) i=1 where in either case, all of the fi i 's have absolute value equal to p 1=2 .
