Abstract: The k -core of a graph is the largest subgraph with minimum degree at least k . For the Erd-os-Renyi random graph G(n; m) on n vertices, with m edges, it is known that a giant 2 -core grows simultaneously with a giant component, that is when m is close to n=2 . We show that for k 3 , with high probability, a giant k -core appears suddenly when m reaches c k n=2 ; here c k = min &gt;0 = k () and k () = PfPoisson() k 1g . In particular, c 3 3:35 . We also demonstrate that, unlike the 2 -core, when a k -core appears for the first time it is very likely to be giant, of size p k ( k )n . Here k is the minimum point of = k () and p k ( k ) = PfPoisson( k ) kg . For k = 3 , for instance, the newborn 3 -core contains about 0:27n vertices. Our proofs are based on the probabilistic analysis of an edge deletion algorithm that always finds a k -core if the graph has one.

Reference-contexts: Leaving aside the probabilistic bounds, that is what is claimed in Theorems 1 and 2! (This heuristic derivation is inspired by Karp-Sipser's probabilistic analysis of a greedy matching algorithm, <ref> [16] </ref>.) We emphasize though that while the reasoning for the subcritical case c &lt; c k can be made rigorous, we do not see any way to do the same for the supercritical case c &gt; c k . <p> A key idea is that|just as G (n; m)|the degrees of heavy vertices of the random graph G (w) must jointly behave like independent Poissons subject to the total sum condition, each bounded below by k , (c.f. Karp and Sipser <ref> [16] </ref>). Introduce a family of v (:= n v 0 P 1jk1 v j ) independent random variables Y 1 ; : : : Y v , each being distributed as Poisson (Z (z)) , conditioned on fZ (z) kg .

Reference-contexts: Notice that ff (1) = 0 , so the percentage of vertices in the giant component is low if c is close to 1 (from above). Why is 1 the threshold value of c ? A semiformal reasoning goes like this (cf. Karp <ref> [17] </ref>). Fix a vertex v and consider a subgraph of G (n; m = cn=2) formed by the vertices whose distance from v is at most * log n .
