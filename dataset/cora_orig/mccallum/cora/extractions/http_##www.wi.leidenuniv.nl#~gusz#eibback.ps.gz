Reference-contexts: In genetic algorithms, the p-sexual voting recombination of Muhlenbein (Muhlenbein, 1989), scanning crossover and diagonal crossover of Eiben et al. <ref> (Eiben et al., 1994) </ref>, and gene-pool recombination of Voigt and Muhlenbein (Muhlenbein and Voigt, 1996; Voigt and Muhlenbein, 1995) are examples of multi-parent operators. <p> Note that the =2-intermediary recombination is a true generalization of the original intermediary recombination; for = 2 it coincides with local intermediary recombination, while for = it equals global intermediary recombination (Back and Schwefel, 1993). Scanning crossover has been introduced in <ref> (Eiben et al., 1994) </ref> for genetic algorithms. It generalizes uniform crossover, although creating only one child. <p> Thus, using our =2-intermediary recombination and scanning crossover, a gradual variation between the two extremes % = 2 and % = is facilitated, while keeping the resulting evolution strategy as closely related to the standard variant as possible. Diagonal crossover as introduced in <ref> (Eiben et al., 1994) </ref> generalizes 1-point crossover and to some extent n-point crossover. On % parents it works by selecting (% 1) crossover points (identical for each parent) and composing % children by taking the resulting % chromosome segments from the parents `along the diagonals'. <p> For the definition see <ref> (Eiben et al., 1994) </ref>. 9 The offspring individual is then produced by concatenating the first segment of the first parent, the second segment of the second parent, and the third segment of the third parent (in general, the ith segment of the ith parent; i = 1; : : : ;

Reference-contexts: Related work on experimental assessment of the (dis)advantages of multi-parent recombination operators includes (Eiben et al., 1995; Eiben and van Kemenade, 1997), where numerical optimization problems are bit-coded and solved by a genetic algorithm using multi-parent crossovers. In <ref> (Eiben and Schippers, 1996) </ref>, pure bit-problems (NK-landscapes (Kauffman, 1993)) are investigated by multi-parent genetic algorithms. The current paper investigates numerical optimization problems with floating point representation and using an evolution strategy with generalized arity of the recombination operators. There are a number of hypotheses and questions to be investigated. <p> Another argument is based on the observation that (binary) NK-landscapes where K is relatively high with respect to N have an irregular structure similar to the Fletcher-Powell function and on such rugged landscapes it has been shown that the performance of multi-parent operators is not related to their arity <ref> (Eiben and Schippers, 1996) </ref>. Nevertheless, there are counterarguments as well. Eiben and van Keme-nade have investigated diagonal crossover on the Fletcher-Powell function too (Eiben and van Kemenade, 1997) and found that increasing the number of parents leads to better GA performance.

Reference-contexts: This skewed initalization is motivated by a recent result by Fogel and Beyer <ref> (Fogel and Beyer, 1995) </ref> stating that if the global optimum is located in the center of the search region covered by initializing the population uniformly at random, intermediary recombination generates offspring individuals which are essentially unbiased estimates of the global optimum.

Reference-contexts: In other words, rather than the genetic information of two different parents, it is the genetic information of diploid (in case of the human genome) homologous chromosomes within each parent that is subject to a rearrangement or recombination <ref> (Gottschalk, 1994) </ref>. Although it is biologically incorrect, in the field of evolutionary computation the term crossing-over or crossover is often used synonymously with recombination, and this convention is adopted in this paper as well. In simulated evolution, that is in evolutionary algorithms, many technical features are inspired by natural mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: There are arguments supporting this conjecture. One agrument is based on the correlation coefficient analysis of Manderick et al. <ref> (Manderick et al., 1991) </ref> that showed that the performance of (two-parent) crossover is inversely related to the correlation between the fitness of parent and offspring chromosomes.

Reference-contexts: In evolution strategies global recombination may mix information from more than two parents in a child (Back and Schwefel, 1993; Schwefel, 1995). Beyer's (=% I ; ), respectively (=% D ; )-strategies (Beyer, 1995), as well as the -ary operators introduced by Schwefel and Rudolph <ref> (Schwefel and Rudolph, 1995) </ref> always mix parents. <p> At present, however, even the relative benefits of global recombination compared to two-parent recombination are neither theoretically understood nor experimentally investigated. Generalization to multi-parent recombination involving % with 2 % parent individuals has recently been proposed by Schwefel and Rudolph <ref> (Schwefel and Rudolph, 1995) </ref>, but an experimental investigation of the new operators has not been performed yet. Beyer (Beyer, 1995) has also introduced a similar generalization, but only performed a theoretical investigation of the case of = showing a -fold speedup on convex objective functions when compared to no recombination. <p> The offspring individuals are created by -fold application of recombination, followed by mutation, to the population, i.e., recombination is always applied in evolution strategies, not just with a certain probability p c such as in genetic algorithms | although this could also be introduced, as proposed in <ref> (Schwefel and Rudolph, 1995) </ref>. 7 2.2 Operators The multi-parent operators investigated in this paper are generalized versions of intermediary recombination, scanning crossover, and diagonal crossover. They are all designed or modified to produce one offspring individual as is common in evolution strategies. <p> Note that this generalization of intermediary recombination is different from the one proposed by Beyer (Beyer, 1995) and Schwefel and Rudolph <ref> (Schwefel and Rudolph, 1995) </ref>, where the i-th allele of the child of the parents fx 1 ; : : : ; x g is 1 k=1 x k i . <p> It can also be deterministic, choosing the most frequently occur 8 ring parent allele (occurrence based scanning). 1 In this investigation uniform scanning crossover is used. Note that uniform scanning crossover corresponds directly to the generalization of discrete recombination according to <ref> (Schwefel and Rudolph, 1995) </ref>. Furthermore, for % = 2 and % = scanning crossover is equivalent to the well-known variants of local discrete and global discrete recombination. <p> Moreover, we make a divison in this catagory, distinguishing the Ackley and the Griewangk functions that have a regular arrangement of their local optima, and the Fletcher-Powell and the Langerman functions, where the local optima are distributed randomly. Note that all functions are of scalable dimensionality. * Sphere model <ref> (Schwefel, 1995) </ref>: f 1 (~x) = i=1 i ; where n = 30 and the object variables x i are initialized in the range 5:12 x 0 * Schwefel's double sum (Schwefel, 1995): f 2 (~x) = i=1 @ j=1 1 2 where n = 30 and 65:536 x 0 i <p> Note that all functions are of scalable dimensionality. * Sphere model <ref> (Schwefel, 1995) </ref>: f 1 (~x) = i=1 i ; where n = 30 and the object variables x i are initialized in the range 5:12 x 0 * Schwefel's double sum (Schwefel, 1995): f 2 (~x) = i=1 @ j=1 1 2 where n = 30 and 65:536 x 0 i 65:536. * Generalized Rastrigin's function (Back and Michalewicz, 1997): f 3 (~x) = 10n + i=1 i 10 cos (2x i ) ; where n = 30 and 5:12 x 0

Beyer's (=% I ; ), respectively (=% D ; )-strategies (Beyer, 1995), as well as the -ary operators introduced by Schwefel and Rudolph <ref> (Schwefel and Rudolph, 1995) </ref> always mix parents. <p> At present, however, even the relative benefits of global recombination compared to two-parent recombination are neither theoretically understood nor experimentally investigated. Generalization to multi-parent recombination involving % with 2 % parent individuals has recently been proposed by Schwefel and Rudolph <ref> (Schwefel and Rudolph, 1995) </ref>, but an experimental investigation of the new operators has not been performed yet. Beyer (Beyer, 1995) has also introduced a similar generalization, but only performed a theoretical investigation of the case of = showing a -fold speedup on convex objective functions when compared to no recombination. <p> The offspring individuals are created by -fold application of recombination, followed by mutation, to the population, i.e., recombination is always applied in evolution strategies, not just with a certain probability p c such as in genetic algorithms | although this could also be introduced, as proposed in <ref> (Schwefel and Rudolph, 1995) </ref>. 7 2.2 Operators The multi-parent operators investigated in this paper are generalized versions of intermediary recombination, scanning crossover, and diagonal crossover. They are all designed or modified to produce one offspring individual as is common in evolution strategies. <p> Note that this generalization of intermediary recombination is different from the one proposed by Beyer (Beyer, 1995) and Schwefel and Rudolph <ref> (Schwefel and Rudolph, 1995) </ref>, where the i-th allele of the child of the parents fx 1 ; : : : ; x g is 1 k=1 x k i . <p> It can also be deterministic, choosing the most frequently occur 8 ring parent allele (occurrence based scanning). 1 In this investigation uniform scanning crossover is used. Note that uniform scanning crossover corresponds directly to the generalization of discrete recombination according to <ref> (Schwefel and Rudolph, 1995) </ref>. Furthermore, for % = 2 and % = scanning crossover is equivalent to the well-known variants of local discrete and global discrete recombination. <p> Moreover, we make a divison in this catagory, distinguishing the Ackley and the Griewangk functions that have a regular arrangement of their local optima, and the Fletcher-Powell and the Langerman functions, where the local optima are distributed randomly. Note that all functions are of scalable dimensionality. * Sphere model <ref> (Schwefel, 1995) </ref>: f 1 (~x) = i=1 i ; where n = 30 and the object variables x i are initialized in the range 5:12 x 0 * Schwefel's double sum (Schwefel, 1995): f 2 (~x) = i=1 @ j=1 1 2 where n = 30 and 65:536 x 0 i <p> Note that all functions are of scalable dimensionality. * Sphere model <ref> (Schwefel, 1995) </ref>: f 1 (~x) = i=1 i ; where n = 30 and the object variables x i are initialized in the range 5:12 x 0 * Schwefel's double sum (Schwefel, 1995): f 2 (~x) = i=1 @ j=1 1 2 where n = 30 and 65:536 x 0 i 65:536. * Generalized Rastrigin's function (Back and Michalewicz, 1997): f 3 (~x) = 10n + i=1 i 10 cos (2x i ) ; where n = 30 and 5:12 x 0
