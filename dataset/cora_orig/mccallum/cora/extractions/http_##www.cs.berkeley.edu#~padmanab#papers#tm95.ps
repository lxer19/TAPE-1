Abstract: Future internetworks will include large numbers of portable devices moving among small wireless cells. We propose a two-level hierarchy for mobility management in such networks. Our hierarchy exploits the locality of user mobility to restrict mobility management traffic to the immediate neighborhood around a mobile node. The first level uses a lightweight mechanism to handle local motion, while the second level uses a more general mechanism to handle movement between subnetworks or administrative domains. Our scheme scales better than, and is compatible with, the Mobile IP standard. We also present an IP-based implementation of wireless handoffs for the first level of the hierarchy. We report the performance of the implementation, and explore the tradeoff between more frequent beacons and smaller retransmission buffers at wireless base stations. Using an Ethernet to emulate a wireless local area network, our handoffs complete in less than 5 milliseconds after a beacon from a base station reaches a mobile node. Our experiments suggest that a 100-millisecond beaconing period, together with a 5-packet buffer per active application-level conversation, provide good quality of service to both audio and reliable data transfer applications.

Reference-contexts: We note that proposed Internet standards for mobility management do not address the issue [13] , and introduce a hierarchical mobility management scheme for datagram internetworks like the Internet. Fast handoff schemes have also been proposed for both connection-oriented and connec-tionless networks. Acampora et al. <ref> [1] </ref> and Keeton et al. [8] propose schemes in which traffic destined to a mobile node is multicast to neighboring cells.

Reference-contexts: Forwarding buffered packets to the new base station after handoff is intended to recover from these losses. Previous work quantified the impact of these losses on reliable transport protocols, and proposed a transport-level solution <ref> [4] </ref> . This work proposes a network-level mechanism that helps not only reliable data transfers but also audio and video streams. We considered having a similar mechanism at the mobile to buffer the last few packets sent upstream, but decided against it.

Reference-contexts: He treats groups of adjacent wireless cells as a cluster, and handles all movement within a cluster in a single ATM switch that is one hop away from all the base stations in the cluster. Eng et al. <ref> [5] </ref> propose another scheme for wireless ATM networks. They use a chaining technique to extend virtual circuits to the mobile's new location, and can later collapse these chains into a new virtual circuit, all while preserving the order of packets.

Reference-contexts: Xie and Goodman [20] propose using a gateway VLR to limit mobility management traffic to the metropolitan area where a mobile currently resides. Jain and Lin <ref> [7] </ref> propose using an anchor VLR and a chain of forwarding pointers to reduce the number of location updates that travel to the HLR. La Porta et al.

Reference-contexts: So it seems that using Mobile IP to handle local mobility would not be very efficient or scalable. This observation motivates the hierarchical organization we describe next. 3.1 Hierarchical Organization Several studies indicate there is significant locality in user mobility [2] <ref> [9] </ref> [17] . A large fraction of people are mobile, but stay within the building. We would like to make handoffs fast and efficient in this common case.

Reference-contexts: ms and 5-10 packets of buffer (per connection) yields a throughput of 98-99% and seems like a good tradeoff point. 5.4 Packet Audio Performance Our goal was to evaluate the effect of handoff on packet audio applications that are built on top of UDP, such as the MBone tool vat <ref> [11] </ref> . We designed a simple UDP benchmark, udpbench, that sends a stream of UDP packets from one host to another, and reports any packet loss, duplication, or reordering at the receiving host.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 points out some areas for future work, and Section 7 concludes the paper. 2 Related Work The problem of excessive mobility management traffic has been recognized in current cellular telephone networks and proposed Personal Communication Services (PCS) networks. Meier-Hellstern et al. <ref> [12] </ref> calculate that cellular networks carry many times more signalling traffic than wired telephone networks (4 to 11 times with their sample parameters). They also predict that PCS networks in turn will carry several times more signalling traffic than cellular networks (3 to 4 times with their sample parameters).

This is work in progress. DRAFT DRAFT Fast and Scalable Handoffs for Wireless Internetworks 18 </note>
Reference-contexts: In these wireless internetworks, users will often carry devices across cell boundaries in the midst of data transfers. A handoff mechanism is needed to maintain connectivity to mobile nodes when they move, while minimizing disruption to ongoing transfers. The emerging Mobile Internet Protocol (IP) standard <ref> [13] </ref> specifies a general handoff protocol for the Internet, but suffers from scaling problems. Mobile IP can handle both local-area and wide-area movement in both wired and wireless networks. <p> In this paper, we point out that excessive mobility management traffic will also plague connectionless networks like the Internet. We note that proposed Internet standards for mobility management do not address the issue <ref> [13] </ref> , and introduce a hierarchical mobility management scheme for datagram internetworks like the Internet. Fast handoff schemes have also been proposed for both connection-oriented and connec-tionless networks. <p> We would like to do the handoff as quickly as possible to minimize disruption in the these streams. Another issue to be addressed is the effect of handoffs on the wired network and fixed hosts. The Mobile IP scheme <ref> [13] </ref> proposed by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) requires the home agent of a mobile (a machine on its home subnet) to be informed whenever it changes its foreign agent (e.g., base station).

Reference-contexts: This includes ioctl-processing, generation/processing of protocol messages, and interaction with the buffer module. All protocol messages are small ICMP <ref> [15] </ref> packets. The size of each message is 42 bytes (the sum of the lengths of the ICMP, IP and Ethernet headers). New ICMP types are defined for each type of protocol message: BEACON, GREET, GREET ACK, FWD REQ, and FWD ACK.

Reference-contexts: A number of mobility management schemes have been proposed to reduce signalling load in such connection-oriented networks. The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) <ref> [16] </ref> and IS-41 [6] cellular standards use Home Location Registers (HLR) and Visitor Location Registers (VLR) to implement mobile registration and tracking. Xie and Goodman [20] propose using a gateway VLR to limit mobility management traffic to the metropolitan area where a mobile currently resides.

Reference-contexts: Again, this could be changed dynami cally. The buffer module is inserted and removed from the system using a modified version of the ifconfig program, following the approach described by Wakeman et al. <ref> [18] </ref> . After DRAFT DRAFT Fast and Scalable Handoffs for Wireless Internetworks 9 the machine boots, ifconfig with the unplumb option is used to tear down any streams associated with the wireless interface on the base station.
