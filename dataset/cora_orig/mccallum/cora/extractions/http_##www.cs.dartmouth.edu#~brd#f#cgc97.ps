Abstract: We consider the family of lines that are area bisectors of a polygon (possibly with holes) in the plane. We say that two bisectors of a polygon P are combinatorially distinct if they induce different partitionings of the vertices of P . We derive an algebraic characterization of area bisectors. We then show that there are simple polygons with n vertices that have (n 2 ) combinatorially distinct area bisectors (matching the obvious upper bound), and present an output-sensitive algorithm for computing an explicit representation of all the bisectors of a given polygon. Our study is motivated by the development of novel, flexible feeding devices for parts positioning and orienting. The question of determining all the bisectors of polygonal parts arises in connection with the development of efficient part positioning strategies when using these devices. fl Work on this paper by Karl-Friedrich Bohringer and Bruce Randall Donald has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grants No. IRI-8802390, IRI-9000532, IRI-9201699, and by a Presidential Young Investigator award to Bruce Donald, in part by NSF/ARPA Special Grant for Experimental Research No. IRI-9403903, and in part by the Air Force Office of Sponsored Research, the Mathematical Sciences Institute, Intel Corporation, and AT&T Bell laboratories.

Acknowledgment We thank Raimund Seidel for suggesting the half-plane intersection approach which led to a considerable improvement over our original approach to output-sensitively exploring the zone of a curve in an arrangement of lines (Section 4) .
