Reference-contexts: Remark 6.6 (Knot Selection) It should be pointed out that the rule (6.3) for selecting n+2 subsets of n+3 knots from the 3 clouds of a given triangle is completely different from another rule as developed earlier in [16, 52], and subsequently used, e.g., in <ref> [1, 42, 87] </ref>. 36 t t d d t t 0;1 (200) d t t d t 0;0 t 1;0 t 1;2 t 2;2 t d d t t t 2;1 (002) t d t d t 0;0 t 1;2 t 2;2 t d t d t t 1;1 t 2;1

Reference-contexts: While the rule (6.3) is based on matching the B-spline recurrence with the recurrence for the normalized B-weights, the previous rule is based on the purely combinatorial recipe of associating a different knot set with every non descending path from (0; 0) to (2; n) on the lattice points in <ref> [0; 2] </ref> fi [0; n]. Note that there are exactly n such different paths. This different knot selection rule is illustrated in Figure 24 for the quadratic case.

Reference-contexts: If piecewise polynomial curves are represented in the Bernstein-Bezier <ref> [24, 6] </ref>, or in the B-spline representation [19, 68], one then obtains Bezier or B-spline tensor product surfaces, in their rational version called NURBS surfaces (non uniform rational B-splines). Unfortunately, tensor product surfaces are inherently rectangular in nature.

Reference-contexts: Their original geometric definition is obtained by projecting a high-dimensional simplex onto the plane and by taking the volume of the fibre over each point. For this reason they are also called simplex splines. Another possible definition is by means of recurrence <ref> [14, 58] </ref>. Althoug this definition runs into trouble for points on the knot lines, these difficulties can easily be overcome by a slight modification of the initialization of the recurrence. All that is required is a slight modification of the area of support for the piecewise constant B-splines. <p> The definition of the set A ~;;* (u) and of the half-open convex hull is illustrated by Figure 18. | With the definition of the half-open convex hull in place we are ready to define bivariate B-splines by means of the following recurrence relation <ref> [14, 58] </ref>: Definition 5.2 (Bivariate B-splines) Let V = ft 0 ; : : : ; t m g be a finite set of points in IR 2 .

Reference-contexts: Ramshaw [65, 66, 67]. The author has subsequently extended this theory to more general surface representations and has used polar forms for the development of B-patches [77, 76, 84]. Further extensions to simplex splines have finally led to the new triangular B-spline scheme described in this paper <ref> [18, 38, 39, 49, 78, 81] </ref>. While previous approaches to the construction of B-spline like surfaces over irregular domains have been based on subdivision, interpolation, and on the use of multisided patches the new scheme is based on blending functions and control points. <p> For the quadratic case, this selection rule is illustrated by Figure 23. | The motivation for our selection rule (6.3) and for the normalization (6.4) comes from the following theorem <ref> [18] </ref>: Theorem 6.4 (B-Weights and Normalized B-Splines) Let K = ft 0;0 ; : : : ; t 0;n ; t 1;0 ; : : : ; t 1;n ; t 2;0 ; : : : ; t 2;n g be a knot net, and let A = ft 0;0 ; <p> Although the proof is not really difficult, it is fairly involved, and is therefore omitted here, due to space limitations. The complete proof can be found in <ref> [18] </ref>. | Using Lemma 6.7 we are then able to represent arbitrary piecewise polynomials as linear combinations of B-splines. 40 Theorem 6.8 (Piecewise Polynomial Representation) Let F be a piecewise poly-nomial of degree n over a given triangulation T , and let F I be the restriction of F to the <p> Theorem 6.8 also implies the following Corollary <ref> [18] </ref>: Corollary 6.9 (Polynomial Representation) Let F be a polynomial of degree n and let f be its polar form.

Reference-contexts: If piecewise polynomial curves are represented in the Bernstein-Bezier [24, 6], or in the B-spline representation <ref> [19, 68] </ref>, one then obtains Bezier or B-spline tensor product surfaces, in their rational version called NURBS surfaces (non uniform rational B-splines). Unfortunately, tensor product surfaces are inherently rectangular in nature.

Unfortunately, tensor product surfaces are inherently rectangular in nature. <p> The development of this scheme is based on the study of polar forms [79]. Polar forms have originally been a tool from classical mathematics [88]. They have first been introduced to CAGD by P. de Faget de Casteljau <ref> [24, 26] </ref> and by L. Ramshaw [65, 66, 67]. The author has subsequently extended this theory to more general surface representations and has used polar forms for the development of B-patches [77, 76, 84]. <p> A deeper mathematical justification for this notation, using tensors, is given in [65]. | 7 3 Triangular Bezier Patches Triangular Bezier patches have originally been introduced by de Casteljau <ref> [24] </ref> using polar forms. They have since been studied widely and are completely understood by now. Several excellent accounts on the subject are available [32, 34, 15, 21]. <p> Unfortunately, this conver gence is too slow to be useful in practice. | 12 3.2 The de Casteljau Algorithm and its Applications The most important algorithm for triangular Bezier patches is the de Casteljau Algorithm <ref> [24] </ref>. Due to the equivalence between polynomials, symmetric multilinear maps, and symmetric multiaffine maps, the de Casteljau Algorithm comes in three different versions: multilinear, multiaffine, and polynomial.

Reference-contexts: Their original geometric definition is obtained by projecting a high-dimensional simplex onto the plane and by taking the volume of the fibre over each point. For this reason they are also called simplex splines. Another possible definition is by means of recurrence <ref> [14, 58] </ref>. Althoug this definition runs into trouble for points on the knot lines, these difficulties can easily be overcome by a slight modification of the initialization of the recurrence. All that is required is a slight modification of the area of support for the piecewise constant B-splines. <p> The definition of the set A ~;;* (u) and of the half-open convex hull is illustrated by Figure 18. | With the definition of the half-open convex hull in place we are ready to define bivariate B-splines by means of the following recurrence relation <ref> [14, 58] </ref>: Definition 5.2 (Bivariate B-splines) Let V = ft 0 ; : : : ; t m g be a finite set of points in IR 2 . <p> The following example <ref> [58] </ref> should help to clarify these concepts: Example 5.3 (Linear B-splines) Let t 0 ; t 1 ; t 2 ; t 3 2 IR 2 be given according to Figure 20.

Reference-contexts: If piecewise polynomial curves are represented in the Bernstein-Bezier [24, 6], or in the B-spline representation <ref> [19, 68] </ref>, one then obtains Bezier or B-spline tensor product surfaces, in their rational version called NURBS surfaces (non uniform rational B-splines). Unfortunately, tensor product surfaces are inherently rectangular in nature.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, not surprisingly, the need for B-spline like surfaces over non-rectangular regions has been expressed quite early <ref> [69] </ref>. This paper presents a new triangular B-spline scheme that allows to construct piecewise polynomial surfaces over arbitrary triangulations of the parameter plane. The development of this scheme is based on the study of polar forms [79]. Polar forms have originally been a tool from classical mathematics [88].
