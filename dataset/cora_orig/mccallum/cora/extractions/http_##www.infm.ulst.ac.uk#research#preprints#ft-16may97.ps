Abstract: Automatic inspection of woven textile fabric is discussed. Two significant problems are addressed: (a) texture feature extraction; Fourier transform features are found to be well matched to the spatially periodic nature of the woven pattern; moreover, they are shift invariant; (b) detector design; maximum likelihood type detectors are inappropriate since we cannot hope to enumerate all defect classes, hence a Neyman-Pearson approach is adopted, i.e. flaw detection is via measured deviation from nominal. The performance of the system is evaluated on samples of denim fabric containing real defects.

Reference-contexts: Related to the previous point, we are studying the incorporation of a robust detection system [16], which is not sensitive to deviations from the assumed data model. We are studying application of the Hough transform, and other detectors of linear clusters, <ref> [1] </ref> to cases where we wish to severly reduce the (point) false alarm rate, yet retain the ability to detect extended linear flaws. 6

Reference-contexts: Both major stages of the system, feature extractor and detector, show potential for high-speed implementation; a neural network implementation has been briefly studied <ref> [2] </ref>. Ongoing work is focussed on the following topics. Firstly, wavelet transforms seem to offer feature extraction capable of operating over a range of scales / resolutions, e.g. the multi-resolution decomposition discussed in [13, 3].

Reference-contexts: Even incorporating spatial processing such as low-pass or median filtering, much of the 'donkey-work' of these processes can be carried out at video-rate by modestly priced frame-grabbers. On the other hand, most texture algorithms, e.g. <ref> [4] </ref>, are computationally complex, and demand extensive serial computation, and thus are poorly matched to high performance implementation. Flaw types encountered in denim are so varied and numerous as to defy enumeration and hence are poorly matched to conventional pattern classification, [7]. <p> Happily, however, due to the nature of the weaving process, the texture of denim is more easily modelled than at first appearance. Although there is a rich literature on texture analysis, <ref> [17, 4, 8] </ref>, the well known techniques seem to us to be beset by three problems: (a) multiplicity of features, (b) opaqueness of features, (c) complexity of algorithms with consequent reduced scope for fast implementation.

Reference-contexts: Many successful AVI systems employ signal processing no more sophisticated than intensity thresholding, perhaps followed by detection based on mere pixel counting [20]. Such an approach is discussed in <ref> [5] </ref> for knitted fabric, where, at least in the examples quoted, flaws are relatively conspicuous. It is clear however, that for the woven cotton fabric denim, discussed here, texture based features are essential.

Reference-contexts: All evidence suggests 32 x 32 pixels as a good compromise though we return to this matter in section 4. 2.5 Detection Algorithm In common with many signal detection problems, [16] the standard Bayesian approach to pattern classification, <ref> [19, 6] </ref> is inappropriate: (a) we cannot identify all possible flaws, never mind gather adequate training data for them, (b) it is impossible to estimate prior probabilities of flaws. Instead, a hypothesis test based on the Neyman-Pearson criterion [16, 19] must be employed.

In this paper, we have persisted with the assumption of Gaussianity for its modelling simplicity, arguing pragmatically that: (i) the Rayleigh distribution function may be roughly approximated by the Gaussian, and (ii) the detector performance figures given above, seem to indicate compatibility.

Reference-contexts: The combination is not simply addition or multiplication, so that there is no straightforward analytical model; nevertheless the pattern is periodic in two dimensions, and can be decomposed into relatively few Fourier components. (For another discussion of Fourier transform texture features, see for example <ref> [11] </ref>). The two-dimensional DFT (2dDFT) of an N row x M column image, is defined by, F (u; v) = 1=M N r=0 c=0 where u = 0::N 1, and v = 0::M 1, are, respectively, the row-wise, and the column-wise frequency indices.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we can obtain the threshold, T, which defines the critical region for Z 2 , from tables of critical values of the chi-squared distribution, e.g. <ref> [12] </ref>. 2.6 Training and Adaptivity Given the choice of detection algorithm (Neyman-Pearson rather than Bayesian), there are corollaries for the training procedure. Firstly, it is necessary to estimate the parameters of only the normal texture; indeed, as already indicated, it is simply impossible to train on flaws. <p> From tables of percentiles of the chi-square distribution, see e.g. <ref> [12] </ref>, we obtained thresholds based on 5%, 1%, and 0.5% false-alarm rates. Figure 2, shows the image with flaw detections superimposed, for prescribed false-alarm rates of 0.5%, and 5%.

Intuitively speaking, the space-dependent Fourier transform (SDFT) is a 2d-DFT taken under a window that is scanned along the image. <p> v) = 1=M N n=0 m=0 where, as before, u; v are the frequency indices; n; m are the row and column indices of the local N x M image whose origin is (r; c). w (n; m) is the two-dimensional analogue of the window function used in spectral analysis <ref> [15] </ref>. As before, the amplitude spectrum is extracted from F s , using eqn. 2. In such a situation, the choice of N and M (window size), needs careful consideration.

Estimate the average 32 x 32 SDFT amplitude spectrum. The amplitude spectral components, along with their frequency indices, are sorted in descending order, thus identifying the dominant spectral components. Because of symmetry in the DFT <ref> [17] </ref>, most spectral components occur in identical pairs one member of which must be rejected. The 'DC' term is always removed. (b) Applying the SDFT feature extractor to the same normal section of the image, we estimate the spectrum, and select the leading p components as identified in (a).

Paradoxically, the uptake of automated manufacturing is not matched by the uptake of AVI; to this is added the irony that manual inspection and reporting techniques are poorly suited to automated manufacturing.
