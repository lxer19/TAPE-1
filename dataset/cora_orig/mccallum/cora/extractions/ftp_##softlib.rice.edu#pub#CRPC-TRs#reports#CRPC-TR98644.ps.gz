Abstract: We are interested in the detection of jump discontinuities in piecewise smooth functions which are realized by their spectral data. Specifically, given the Fourier coefficients, f ^ f k = a k +ib k g N k=1 , we form the generalized conjugate partial sum ~ S N [f ](x) = k=1 ( k N )(a k sin kx b k cos kx). The classical conjugate partial sum, ~ S N [f ](x), corresponds to 1 and it is known that log N ~ S N [f ](x) converges to the jump function [f ](x) := f (x+) f (x); thus, log N ~ S N [f ](x) tends to 'concentrate' near the edges of f . The convergence, however, is at the unacceptably slow rate of order O(1= log N ). To accelerate the convergence, thereby creating an effective edge detector, we introduce the so called 'concentration factors', k;N = ( k N ). Our main result shows that an arbitrary C 2 [0; 1] non-decreasing (x) satisfying R 1 N x dx ! log N ), we demonstrate the examples of two families of concentration functions

Our main result shows that an arbitrary C 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> non-decreasing (x) satisfying Z 1 N x N!1 is 'admissible', in the sense that the corresponding generalized conjugate sum satisfies the concentration property ~ S N!1 To demonstrate our above arguments, we consider the following two examples (on [; ]): f a (x) := cos ( 2 (2 + <p> We summarize our results (adding minimal requirements on the smoothness of the concentration function (x)) in the following two assertions. The first deals with the total mass of the concentration kernel, ~ K N .

If also (x) x 2 L 1 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, then admissibility requires only the scaling condition Z 1 (x) dx = : (3.28) It is easy to see from the above discussion that D k;N , F k;N (and in particular, G k;N ) are admissible concentration factors: in the first case, the Fourier concentration factors N (x) <p> to admissible continuous concentration factors k;N in (3.1) t k;N = 2 ) 2 2 ; (4.9) then ~ T t N [f ](x) satisfies the concentration property ~ T t Furthermore, the direct analogue to the continuous case offers a more general result: Theorem 4.2 Consider a C 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> discrete concentration function t (x) such that jt ( 1 N )j Const: 1 log N .

The first approach is a straightforward extension of the concentration property of the saw-tooth function asserted in (2.6), along the lines of <ref> [18, xII Theorem 8.13] </ref>. Proof. Consider the function g (x) f (x) [f](~) ~ (x); where ~ (x) is the saw-tooth function with a -jump at x = ~.

To gain better insight into their overall improved accuracy, we analyze the behavior of ~ S p N [1](x) = N (x) for x's away from the assumed jump discontinuity at x = ~, consult (3.5).
