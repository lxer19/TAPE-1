Abstract: This paper studies a statistical skin-color model and its adaptation. It is revealed that (1) human skin colors cluster in a small region in a color space; (2) the variance of a skin color cluster can be reduced by intensity normalization, and (3) under a certain lighting condition, a skin-color distribution can be characterized by a multivariate normal distribution in the normalized color space. We then propose an adaptive model to characterize human skin-color distributions for tracking human faces under different lighting conditions. The parameters of the model are adapted based on the maximum likelihood criterion. The model has been successfully applied to a real-time face tracker and other applications.

Reference-contexts: These features, however, may change from time to time. Occlusion and non-rigidity are basic problems with these features. Color is another feature on human faces. Much research has been directed to understanding and making use of color information. Color has been long used for recognition and segmentation <ref> [1, 2] </ref> and recently has been successfully used face locating and tracking [3, 4, 5]. However, color is not a physical phenomenon. It is a perceptual phenomenon that is related to the spectral characteristics of electro-magnetic radiation in the visible wavelengths striking the retina [6].

In the mid-1980s, it was recognized that the color histogram for a single inhomogeneous surface with highlights will have a planar distribution in color space [7]. It has since been shown that the colors do not fall randomly in a plane, but form clusters at specific points [8].

Reference-contexts: To perform a goodness-of-fit test, we first need to formulate a null hypothesis. NULL hypothesis: human skin-color is normally distributed in a normalized bivariate space. An immediate difficulty of the task is that there is no commonly agreed analytical tool available to test the normality of a bivariate distribution <ref> [9] </ref>. In order to solve the problem, we used a two step strategy: first we test the marginal distribution and then test multivariate distribution. If a multivariate distribution is a normal distribution, its marginal distributions must be normal distributions. <p> The basic idea of the Q-Q plot is to use the cumulative probability of the sampling data against that of the tested distribution. A straight line indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis (the interested readers are referred to textbooks on the subject, e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>). When we do marginal test, we test each variable separately against the normal distribution. When we test the bivariate distribution, we test the transformed variable against 2 distribution [9]. We first tested marginal distributions. As the results, we could not reject the null hypothesis. <p> straight line indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis (the interested readers are referred to textbooks on the subject, e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>).

Both the normalized "r" and "g" are straight lines. We then tested bivariate distributions.
