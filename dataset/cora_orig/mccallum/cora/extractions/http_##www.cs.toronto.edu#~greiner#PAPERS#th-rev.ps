Abstract: The fault hierarchy representation is widely used in expert systems for the diagnosis of complex mechanical devices. On the assumption that an appropriate bias for a knowledge representation language is also an appropriate bias for learning in this domain, we have developed a theory revision method that operates directly on a fault hierarchy. This task presents several challenges: A typical training instance is missing most feature values, and the pattern of missing features is significant, rather than merely an effect of noise. Moreover, the accuracy of a candidate theory is measured by considering both the sequence of tests required to arrive at a diagnosis and its agreement with the diagnostic endpoints provided by an expert. This paper first describes the algorithm for theory revision of fault hierarchies that was designed to address these challenges, then discusses its application in knowledge base maintenance and reports on experiments that use to revise a fielded diagnostic system.

Reference-contexts: However, the selective nature of the diagnostic process means that only a few of the many possible feature values are specified in any instance, and the set of features present is correlated with the diagnosis itself <ref> (Rao, Greiner, & Hancock, 1994) </ref>. We must deal with both issues as part of a practical approach to knowledge base maintenance. In the next section, we explain the structure of fault scanner.
