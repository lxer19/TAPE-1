Abstract: Complexity Results for 1-safe Nets ? Abstract We study the complexity of several standard problems for 1-safe Petri nets and some of its subclasses. We prove that reachability, liveness, and deadlock are all PSPACE-complete for 1-safe nets. We also prove that deadlock is NP-complete for free-choice nets and for 1-safe free-choice nets. Finally, we prove that for arbitrary Petri nets, deadlock is equivalent to reachability and liveness.

Reference-contexts: Other versions of 1-safe nets can be found in the literature, namely the Condition/Event systems [30] and the Elementary Net Systems [33]. This multiplicity of definitions is maybe annoying but harmless: the differences among them are small, and of rather technical nature (see <ref> [1] </ref> for a discussion). In particular, our results are independent of the definition used. 3 2 Definitions We recall in this section some basic concepts about Place/Transition nets and 1-safe nets, and define the reachability, liveness and deadlock problems.

Reference-contexts: A subset Q of places of N is a siphon if * Q Q * , and a trap if Q * * Q. We use some well known lemmata about siphons and traps. They can all be found in [15] or amore accessible reference in <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> Let Q be a siphon of N which contains no trap marked at M 0 . Then, there exists a reachable marking M such that Q is unmarked at it. Proof. See <ref> [15, 2] </ref>. This result is part of the proof of Commoner's theorem. 2 Using these lemmata, we can now characterise when a free-choice net has a deadlock. Lemma 13 Let N be a free-choice net.

Reference-contexts: The advantages of 1-safe nets are numerous, and they have become a significant model. Several semantics can be smoothly defined for 1-safe nets <ref> [3, 28] </ref>, but are however difficult to extend to Place/Transition nets. Nielsen, Rozenberg and Thiagarajan [33, 28] have shown that a model of 1-safe nets, called Elementary Net Systems, has strong categorical connections with many other models of concurrency, such as event structures (another good reference is [35]).

So, there are no essential differences between the general and the 1-safe case. Conflict-free nets are a subclass in which conflicts are structurally ruled out (actually, this depends slightly on the notion of conflict used).

Reference-contexts: They proved that the liveness problem for 1-conservative (not necessarily 1-safe) nets is in PSPACE. To prove completeness, we show that the problem (DETERMINISTIC) LINEAR BOUNDED AUTOMATON ACCEPTANCE (which is PSPACE-complete <ref> [12, pp.265] </ref>) is polynomial-time reducible to the liveness problem. A linear bounded automaton is a Turing machine which only visits the cells of the tape containing the input. <p> The above algorithm uses 2jP j bits, and is thus in PSPACE. 2 Theorem 6 The reachability problem for unary 1-safe nets is PSPACE-complete.

Reference-contexts: The deadlock problem for a net is the problem of deciding if any of its reachable markings is a deadlock. 3 Place/Transition Nets For Place/Transition nets, it is known that the liveness and reachability problems are recursively equivalent <ref> [16] </ref>, and that they are both decidable and EXPSPACE-hard [24]. We complete the picture by showing that the deadlock problem is recursively equivalent to them, and thus decidable and EXPSPACE-hard. Theorem 1 Reachability is polynomial-time reducible to deadlock. Proof. <p> Thus, the deadlock problem is decidable and EXPSPACE-hard. Proof. For the equivalence of the problems, combine theorems 1 and 2 with Hack's reduction from liveness to reachability <ref> [16] </ref>. For the complexity of the deadlock problem, use the equivalence with reachability and obtain the decidability from Mayr [25] and the EXPSPACE-hardness from Lipton [24]. 2 The technique of the proofs is similar to those of, for instance, Chapter 5 in Petersons book [29]. <p> The same result holds for Place/Transition nets with arc weights. To see this, just observe that our constructions can still be applied and that Hack considers nets with arc weights <ref> [16] </ref>. 4 1-Safe Nets Given a Place/Transition net, it is PSPACE-complete to decide if the net is 1-safe [22, Corollary 3.4]. However, it is many times possible to guarantee 1-safeness by construction. Consider for instance the important case where the nets are constructed as a synchronization of finite automata.

It is shown by Howell and Rosier in [19, 20] that the coverability problem for 1-safe conflict-free nets is solvable in polynomial time. We study the first three of these problems in the 1-safe case.

Reference-contexts: The input is bounded by a left and a right marker, say # and $, and the head can visit no cell to the left of # and no cell to the right of $ (see <ref> [18] </ref> for a formal definition). The problem is defined as follows: Given: a deterministic linearly bounded automaton M 0 and an input x for M 0 , To decide: if M 0 accepts x. <p> For both acyclic Place/Transition nets and for acyclic 1-safe nets, the reachability problem is NP-complete. For acyclic 1-safe nets, NP-hardness of reachability was proved by Stewart [32], and for acyclic Place/Transition nets, membership in NP follows by a straightforward reduction to INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING [5], which is in NP <ref> [18] </ref>. So, there are no essential differences between the general and the 1-safe case. Conflict-free nets are a subclass in which conflicts are structurally ruled out (actually, this depends slightly on the notion of conflict used).

However, it is many times possible to guarantee 1-safeness by construction. Consider for instance the important case where the nets are constructed as a synchronization of finite automata. In this section we prove that the reachability, liveness and deadlock problems are PSPACE-complete for 1-safe nets. <p> First we consider the liveness problem. Theorem 4 The liveness problem for 1-safe nets is PSPACE-complete. Proof. To prove that the liveness problem is in PSPACE, we can use essentially the technique of Jones, Landweber, and Lien <ref> [22, Theorem 3.9] </ref>. They proved that the liveness problem for 1-conservative (not necessarily 1-safe) nets is in PSPACE. To prove completeness, we show that the problem (DETERMINISTIC) LINEAR BOUNDED AUTOMATON ACCEPTANCE (which is PSPACE-complete [12, pp.265]) is polynomial-time reducible to the liveness problem. <p> a t ; R; q r ; a l ) 2 ffi (move right), then T includes for every cell 1 i &lt; n a transition Q i;s + A i;t ! Q i+1;r + A i;l (where we use + instead of set union to use the notation of <ref> [22] </ref>; notice that no transition is needed for the n-th cell). Similarly for left moves and no motion. The transitions corresponding to an element of fi n ffi have C in their preset, and can therefore only occur if C is marked. <p> The interested reader can find a formal definition in <ref> [22, 17] </ref>. Figure 3 shows a non-free-choice net (on the left), and its released form (on the right). Perhaps surprisingly, the liveness problem is polynomial for this class. Theorem 9 The liveness problem for free-choice 1-safe nets is solvable in polynomial time. Proof. <p> Given an instance of CON-SAT, we construct a free-choice net N in polynomial time and show that that it has a deadlock iff is satisfiable. The construction is very similar to the one used in <ref> [22] </ref> to prove the NP-completeness of liveness in general free-choice nets. We describe the set P of places and the set T of transitions of N , together with their presets and postsets. <p> Using the releasing technique it is easy to show that the reach-ability problem for free-choice nets is as hard as the reachability problem for arbitrary Place/Transition nets, and therefore EXPSPACE-hard. The liveness problem was shown to be NP-complete in <ref> [22] </ref>. <p> Crudely speaking, once fl has occurred, even interleaved with transitions of T n T 0 , t cannot occur until some transition of T 0 occurs. T 0 is said to control t if T 0 can control t by at least one sequence fl. The controllability problem <ref> [22] </ref> for a net is the problem of deciding whether T 0 controls t given N , T 0 , and t as above. For arbitrary Petri nets, the containment problem is undecidable [17], whereas the coverability, persistency and controllability problems are EXPSPACE-hard. <p> Extend the net in the proof of Theorem 6 with two new places fV; W g and the transitions G F ! V Clearly, the new net is persistent if and only if F is true. 2 The proof of the result that controllability is EXPSPACE-complete <ref> [22, Theorem 4.1] </ref> was in fact given for 1-conservative free-choice nets, and also works when restricted to 1-safe nets. This is the only one of the problems we consider for which the complexity does not decrease for 1-safe nets.

We complete the picture by showing that the deadlock problem is recursively equivalent to them, and thus decidable and EXPSPACE-hard. Theorem 1 Reachability is polynomial-time reducible to deadlock. Proof. <p> Proof. For the equivalence of the problems, combine theorems 1 and 2 with Hack's reduction from liveness to reachability [16]. For the complexity of the deadlock problem, use the equivalence with reachability and obtain the decidability from Mayr [25] and the EXPSPACE-hardness from Lipton <ref> [24] </ref>. 2 The technique of the proofs is similar to those of, for instance, Chapter 5 in Petersons book [29]. The same result holds for Place/Transition nets with arc weights.

Reference-contexts: Petri nets are one of the oldest and most studied formalisms for the investigation of concurrency <ref> [30] </ref>. Shortly after the birth of complexity theory, Jones, Landweber, and Lien studied in their classical paper [22] the complexity of several fundamental problems for Place/Transition nets (called in [22] just Petri nets). This paper was later followed by many others (see [10] for an overview). <p> Finally, in section 6 other problems are studied. We finish this introduction with a remark. In the paper, 1-safe nets are defined as a subclass of Place/Transition nets. Other versions of 1-safe nets can be found in the literature, namely the Condition/Event systems <ref> [30] </ref> and the Elementary Net Systems [33]. This multiplicity of definitions is maybe annoying but harmless: the differences among them are small, and of rather technical nature (see [1] for a discussion). <p> Finally M 0 0 is defined by M 0 0 (p) = M 0 (p) for every place p of N , and M 0 0 (p) = 1 M 0 (p) for each complement place. The construction is very similar to the one of <ref> [30] </ref>, and therefore we omit the proof of the result; the only difference is the special treatment of the case in which two arcs (p; t) and (t; p) exist. 5 Subclasses In this section we study the complexity of our three problems for three subclasses of nets which have been

Reference-contexts: This set Q of places is a siphon because Q * = T . Then, check in polynomial time that it contains no trap marked at the initial marking using Starke's algorithm to find the maximal trap contained in a given siphon <ref> [31] </ref> (see [8] for a reference in English). We prove completeness by reducing the satisfiability problem of propositional formulas in conjunctive normal form (CON-SAT) to the deadlock problem.

Reference-contexts: Since all 1-safe acyclic nets contain deadlocks, the liveness and deadlock problems are trivial. For both acyclic Place/Transition nets and for acyclic 1-safe nets, the reachability problem is NP-complete. For acyclic 1-safe nets, NP-hardness of reachability was proved by Stewart <ref> [32] </ref>, and for acyclic Place/Transition nets, membership in NP follows by a straightforward reduction to INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING [5], which is in NP [18]. So, there are no essential differences between the general and the 1-safe case.

In particular, in 1-safe free-choice net the phenomenon known as confusion <ref> [33] </ref> is ruled out. A net N = (P; T; F; M 0 ) is said to be acyclic if F + (the transitive closure of F ) is irreflexive.
