Reference-contexts: It is worthwhile noting here that Jaskowski did not use the term natural deduction; he called his approach: the method of supposition. A similar approach is called the method of subordinate proofs by Fitch <ref> [1] </ref>. * The system of natural deduction is very simple, as only about a dozen intuitively obvious inference rules suffices to prove whatever is provable in classical logic.

Reference-contexts: These include: proving an implication by assuming the antecedent and proving the consequent, case analysis, proofs by contradiction, mutual implication, contrapositive, proving a universally quantified formula, using an existential assumption. To quote from Gries <ref> [2] </ref>, p. 7: "Suddenly, the kinds of informal proofs that students have seen earlier in their education begin to make sense." We believe that logic at this level is like arithmetic.

Reference-contexts: For example, consider the theorem on exchange of existential and universal quantifiers. Compare the equational version of Figure 2 (a slightly modified version of Gries and Schneider <ref> [3] </ref>, page 166) with the Mizar-MSE version of Figure 3 (which has been annotated to indicate the inference rules employed). 5 Theorem (9.29) Interchange of quantifications: For any P , Q, and R, provided that :occurs (`y'; `R') and :occurs (`x'; `Q'), (9x j R : (8y j Q : P

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, equational reasoning can save many steps over the standard natural deduction argument. Figure 4 is an example where the equational reasoning approach is clearly superior (taken from <ref> [4] </ref>, page 5). Contrast this with the longer Mizar-MSE proof, Figure 5, where we do not have a term language, and a cumbersome means of handling equivalences.

Reference-contexts: The syntax of the Mizar-MSE input language is a notation of natural deduction derived from the style of Gentzen, Jaskowski and Fitch. We have chosen a logical system which is an extension of a natural deduction system for the following two reasons: * Jaskowski's goal (see <ref> [5] </ref> reprinted in [6]) was to identify the methods used by mathematicians in their proofs, "to put those methods under the form of structural rules and to analyze their relation to the theory of deduction." Inspection shows that he has achieved his goal: indeed the proof structures of his logical system
