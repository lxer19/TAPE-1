Abstract: 1 ABSTRACT We investigate the synergy of the two hands for virtual object manipulation. We report results from an experiment which suggest that the two hands together provide sufficient perceptual cues to form a frame of reference which is independent of visual feedback. The same is not true for one hand moving in empty space. Our interpretation is that users may not have to constantly maintain visual attention when both hands can be involved in a manipulation. We also found a transfer of skill from the bimanual to the unimanual conditions we tested. Thus, subjects who performed the bimanual condition first seemed to learn a more effective task strategy for the unimanual condition. This further suggests that involving both hands in the physical articulation of a task can inuence cognitive aspects of performance, in terms of the task strategy used.

Reference-contexts: Another technique is to introduce a grounding object such as a drafting table; but even in this situation, using two hands plus the grounding object allows interesting design possibilities <ref> [1] </ref>. Our second high-level hypothesis is that in some cases using both hands can change the way users think about a task.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, both conditions utilized a space-multiplexed design, with a separate input device for each function, as opposed to a time-multiplexed design, where a single device controls multiple functions by changing modes. Brooks <ref> [2] </ref> reports that overloading a device with multiple functions can often cause confusion. Thus, we chose a space-multiplexed design for the unimanual condition because we did not want the possible issue of users becoming confused over which mode they were in to interfere with the experiment itself.

Reference-contexts: As a thought experiment, one can imagine using a single hand to move the plate tool relative to a dolls head mounted on a pivot. This would be analogous to using one hand on a tablet fitted with a physical template, which works well <ref> [4] </ref>. But our experimental findings suggest that the dynamic role of the nonpreferred hand also led to a cognitive performance benefit in terms of task strategy chosen.

Reference-contexts: The second phase consisted of a memory test where users tried to reproduce the placement of their dominant hand without any visual feedback. We used the input devices from our neurosurgical visualization system (fig. 1), which were designed to allow neurosur-geons to explore cross-sections of volumetric data <ref> [5] </ref>. In the current experiment, the dolls head controls the orientation and depth of a target object (fig. 2, left). The dolls head uses only four degrees of freedom for movement: the up-down and left-right translations are constrained so that the target object always stays centered on the screen. <p> The interaction techniques used for this portion of the experiment were identical to those used in our neurosurgical visualization system, and have been informally evaluated and refined with hundreds of test users (physicians and non-physicians alike) prior to this experiment <ref> [5] </ref>. angle, is shown on the left. Users tried to move the plane so that it was roughly coplanar with the target object, causing it to highlight (right). The stage in the background served only as a simple perceptual aid and never moved.

Reference-contexts: CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Our high-level hypothesis is that using both hands can help users gain a better sense of the space they are working in <ref> [6] </ref>; this study has provided some initial evidence which helps to support this claim. Immersive VR systems which use just one hand often do not offer users any physical reference points.

Reference-contexts: If we had used featureless spheres as input devices, for example, subjects probably would have had a less acute sense of the orientation of each device <ref> [8] </ref>. We also believe that allowing contact between the two hands was a factor in the experiment, but not the only factor. When using two hands, subjects could often come quite close to the original position even before contact was established.

Reference-contexts: Cognitive Aspects of Performance Hypothesis 3, which asserts that using two hands can inu-ence cognitive aspects of performance, has previously been articulated by Buxton. Working with his Input Research Group, Leganchuk <ref> [9] </ref> has provided some preliminary evidence which suggests that representation of the task in the bimanual case reduces cognitive load.

The means grouped by order (table 3) show this effect. When performing unimanual first, subjects distance was 5% better on the subsequent bimanual condition than those subjects who completed bimanual first.

Reference-contexts: Unimanual control is more dependent on visual feedback and can therefore impede the users ability to split attention between multiple tasks. The Worlds-in-Miniature (WIM) interface metaphor <ref> [16] </ref> provides an example of these issues in action. The WIM provides the virtual reality user with a hand-held miniature representation of the immersive life-size world. Users interact with the WIM using both hands.
