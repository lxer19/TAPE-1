Abstract: Loan level modeling of prepayment is an important aspect of hedging, risk assessment, and retention efforts of the hundreds of companies in the US that trade and initiate Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS). In this paper we review and investigate different aspects of modeling customers who have taken jumbo loans in the US using MineSet TM . We show how refinancing costs differ across states and counties, and which attributes make good predictor variables for prepayment forecasts. Our data comes from the McDASH Analytics database containing real data, which tracks loans over the past nine years at monthly intervals.

Reference-contexts: Such companies would maintain the secrecy of these models as a competitive advantage. In a collaboration between Risk Monitors, Inc. and Silicon Graphics Inc., we have embarked on building such models using MineSet TM <ref> (Brunk, Kelly, & Ko-havi 1997) </ref>. This project involved the identification and verification of drivers for prepayment forecasts. Even Copyright c fl 1998, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Reference-contexts: Building a Simple-Bayes Model Duda & Hart 1973) for prepayments. The visualization consists of rows of bars, one for each attribute. The attributes are sorted in order of importance computed as the conditional entropy <ref> (Cover & Thomas 1991) </ref> of each attribute and the label. The bar height gives evidence that is additive as opposed to multiplicative.

Reference-contexts: We then removed all the other lags to make our dataset narrower and avoid highly correlated attributes, but this fact, by itself, was useful insight as to the time it takes people to react to changes in economic conditions. 1 the solution for this computation is algorithmic based on <ref> (Fabozzi 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One year treasury Interest rate. 1-year Treasury CMT Rate. Ten year treasury Interest rate. 10-year Treasury CMT Rate. Yield Curve slope (YCS) The difference between the ten year treasury (T10Y) and one year treasury (T1Y) <ref> (Litterman, Scheinkman, & Weiss 1991) </ref>: YCS = (T10Y T1Y)=Average monthly (T10Y T1Y) Typically, the ten year treasury note has a higher interest rate, but the difference between the curves at a given point in time changes. <p> Low values for yield Curve Slope (lagged 4 weeks). A yield curve slope that is smaller (flatter) than the sample average slope results in greater prepayment activity. This probably reflects declines in long term interest rates which stimulate prepayment activity <ref> (Litterman, Scheinkman, & Weiss 1991) </ref>. (Note the results of ten-year Treasury Rate and FHLMC 30 year Mortgage Rate factors examined above.) 8. Small loan amounts (up to $200,000).

Reference-contexts: The leftmost bar represent unknowns, which correlate with recent 1998 data (where refinancing is on the rise). High delta price indices imply an increase in a borrower's home equity value, which can put the owner in a better rate bracket <ref> (Peristiani et al. 1996) </ref>. 3. Note rates with rates over 8%. These people are likely to refinance at lower rates. This behavior is consistent with previous empirical analysis (Brown 1992; Harmon 1996). 4. "Current year" (of record) equal to 1994 or 1998. <p> We find an opposite impact that most probably is attributable to the current burnout counter which should not accumulate if the borrower is prevented from refinancing due to equity and credit constraints <ref> (Peristiani et al. 1996) </ref>. Further reasarch and additional data will examine this hypotheses in more detail. 10. Low Current Principal Balance (not shown). Lower principal balances reflect higher prepayment activity. 11. Specific Loan Purposes (not shown).
