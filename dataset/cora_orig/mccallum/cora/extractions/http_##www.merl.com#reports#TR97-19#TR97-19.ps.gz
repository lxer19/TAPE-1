Abstract: This paper presents a survey of the work done in modeling deformable objects within the computer graphics research community. The research has a long history and a wide variety of approaches have been used. This paper organizes the diversity of research by the technique used rather than by the application, although applications are discussed throughout. This paper presents some purely geometric approaches for modeling deformable objects, but focuses on physically based approaches. In the latter category are mass-spring models, finite element models, approximate continuum models, and low degree of freedom models. Special emphasis is placed on finite element models, which offer the greatest accuracy, but have seen limited use in computer graphics.

Reference-contexts: Related mappings generate rigid motion, tapering, bending, and so on. More complex deformations can be constructed by composing mappings. Barr studied the transformation of surface tangent and normal vectors under such mappings, and the hierarchical arrangement of such mappings <ref> [Bar84] </ref>. Barr's space-warping method provides a powerful design tool, but the possible regions and types of deformations are limited, and the user's control of deformation is not very intuitive.

Reference-contexts: Finite element methods, FEM, divide the object into a set of elements and approximate the continuous equilibrium equation over each element. In the following, a general approach to FEM is presented. The reader is referred to textbooks such as <ref> [Bat96] </ref> or [Seg84] for more detailed treatment. 4.1 General finite element methods FEM is used to find an approximation for a continuous function that satisfies some equilibrium expression such as the deformation equilibrium expression described above.

Reference-contexts: Stiff systems are problematic because they have poor stability, requiring the numerical integrator to take small time steps, even when the interesting modes of motion occur over much longer time intervals. The result is a slow simulation. A good description of this problem is in <ref> [BW92] </ref>. 4 Continuum models and finite element meth ods Mass-spring models start with a discrete object model. More accurate physical models treat deformable objects as a continuum: solid bodies with mass and energies distributed throughout. <p> There are also ways to incorporate constraints into the formulation, which provide a high level way to manipulating the objects. See [WW90] for details. Baraff and Witkin used this basic approach in simulating combinations of rigid and deformable bodies with non-penetration constraints <ref> [BW92] </ref>. 6.3 Minimal Energy surfaces Several researchers have explored ways to add physical behavior to the traditional geometric modeling primitives, particularly parametric surface patches. This is done by minimizing an energy functional defined on the surface. <p> Modeling forces between deformable objects and their environments also needs further study. Some systems have taken initial steps toward solving these challenging problems, for example <ref> [BW92, PW89, TT94] </ref>, however, faster and more accurate algorithms are still needed. The solutions to these problems will make existing simulation systems more flexible and powerful than they are today.

They used 2D triangular surface elements and Hermite polynomials functions (3rd order cubic polynomials) as interpolation functions to model the 3D displacements of the triangle vertices for deforming surfaces. User-controlled external forces are applied to edit the object shape.

Reference-contexts: The muscles are embedded in a lattice of 8-node mass-spring elements and deformed by applying forces to the lattice MERL-TR-97-19 November 1997 7 node points. The dynamic deformation of the muscle model is calculated by interpolating the motion of the lattice points <ref> [CHP89] </ref>. Terzopoulos et. al. describe a mass-spring model for deformable bodies that experience state transitions from solid to liquid [TPF89]. Nodes are connected by springs in a hexahedral lattice. Each node has an associated temperature as well as a position, and the spring stiffnesses between nodes are dependent on temperature.

Reference-contexts: An implicit Euler integration method is used for added stability in the presence of large forces. Aquatic plants are also modeled with mass-spring systems [TT94]. Christensen et. al. also embedded objects in a cubic, 8-node mass-spring lattice and used dynamic simulation and FFD's to animate the embedded objects <ref> [CMN97] </ref>. By changing the spring stiffness matrix to correspond to vibrational modes such as twisting, scaling, and shearing at specific times in the animation sequence, they obtain whimsical but physical behavior of the animated objects. 3.2 Advantages and limitations Mass-spring systems are a simple physical model with well understood dynamics.

Reference-contexts: This solution is the final equilibrium position of the surface, however dynamic effects are easily incorporated by adding mass and damping terms. Then one obtains Equation (1) with diagonal M and C matrices. That equation can be numerically integrated to cause the surface to evolve over time <ref> [CW92] </ref>. Welch and Witkin further developed this idea by adding automatic refinement to the algorithm. Nonuniform subdivision is applied to the B-spline surface to ensure that the constraints are met, and to enforce error bounds.

Hierarchical techniques approximate the deformation from a coarse to fine scale to improve convergence or response time without sacrificing too much realism. Examples of these hierarchical techniques are: modal analysis <ref> [PW89, ESP92, CZ92] </ref>; multigrid finite element methods, where the object deformation is analyzed from a coarse to fine grid; and combined kinematic-dynamic models.

The algorithm supports real-time deformation of an object with as many as 125,000 elements. Finally, there is a need to integrate deformable objects into broader simulation contexts. While great strides have been made in deformable object modeling, the deformable object is not an isolated system.

Reference-contexts: Once the kinetic and potential energies are specified, the methods of Lagrangian dynamics (see, for example, <ref> [Gol80] </ref>) generate the equations of motion of the system, in the form given by (1). For computer vision and model fitting applications, the forces acting on the dynamic model come from features of a two-dimensional image or three-dimensional range map. <p> If one expresses the object's kinetic and potential energies in terms of these coordinates, the Lagrangian formulation provides a straightforward method of computing the dynamics of the object, that is, how the coordinates change over time. Details of the method are in <ref> [Gol80] </ref>. The kinetic energy is simple to compute. Differentiating (14) with respect to time gives the velocity _ x of a point x, and summing the m i k _ x i k 2 =2 terms over a set of discretized mass points gives an approximation of the kinetic energy.

Reference-contexts: Alternative approximate continuum models have been proposed that restrict the deformable object to many fewer degrees of freedom, sacrificing generality for speed. MERL-TR-97-19 November 1997 21 6.1 Modal analysis Pentland and Williams developed a simplified expression for the dynamics of deformable bodies using modal analysis <ref> [PW89] </ref>. Given the mass, damping, and stiffness matricies, M, C and K of Equation (1), there exists a matrix and a diagonal matrix such that = M 1 K: The columns of are the generalized eigenvectors of M and K, and the diagonal elements of are the generalized eigenvalues. <p> Promising methods for improving the speed of deformable modeling include parallel hardware systems, intelligent model simplification, and hierarchical techniques. Hierarchical techniques approximate the deformation from a coarse to fine scale to improve convergence or response time without sacrificing too much realism. Examples of these hierarchical techniques are: modal analysis <ref> [PW89, ESP92, CZ92] </ref>; multigrid finite element methods, where the object deformation is analyzed from a coarse to fine grid; and combined kinematic-dynamic models. <p> Modeling forces between deformable objects and their environments also needs further study. Some systems have taken initial steps toward solving these challenging problems, for example <ref> [BW92, PW89, TT94] </ref>, however, faster and more accurate algorithms are still needed. The solutions to these problems will make existing simulation systems more flexible and powerful than they are today.

Reference-contexts: Terzopoulos and Witkin represented a deformable body by a rigid reference body that captures the rigid-body motion, and a discretized displacement function that gives the location of the mesh nodes relative to their positions on the undeformed reference body <ref> [TW88] </ref>.

The reference body eliminates the need to capture the reference shape in the potential energy functional (13) via G 0 . <p> The rigid portion of the representation also includes the standard rigid body degrees of freedom. As in <ref> [TW88] </ref>, the positions of model points are the vector sum of their positions on the rigid body model, and an offset described by a displacement function.

Later, Waters used computer tomography (CT) data to generate the three-dimensional facial model [Wat92]. Lee, Terzopoulos, and Waters used a mesh adaptation algorithm that tailors a generic mesh to the individual's features by locating these features in a laser-scanned depth image.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a modal representation is ideal for controlling level of detail in deformable object simulation. MERL-TR-97-19 November 1997 22 6.2 Dynamic global deformations Witkin and Welch developed a technique for animating and controlling de-formable bodies that experience global deformations <ref> [WW90] </ref>. These deformations are similar to Barr's space-warping functions (Section 2.2) in that they are characterized by a map from &lt; 3 to &lt; 3 . However, Witkin and Welch also introduce a time dependence into the deformation in order to animate deformable objects. <p> Within restricted classes of deformation functions, the dynamics computations can be accelerated by precomputing certain quantities. There are also ways to incorporate constraints into the formulation, which provide a high level way to manipulating the objects. See <ref> [WW90] </ref> for details. Baraff and Witkin used this basic approach in simulating combinations of rigid and deformable bodies with non-penetration constraints [BW92]. 6.3 Minimal Energy surfaces Several researchers have explored ways to add physical behavior to the traditional geometric modeling primitives, particularly parametric surface patches.

Reference-contexts: Nonuniform subdivision is applied to the B-spline surface to ensure that the constraints are met, and to enforce error bounds. The user manipulates a surface that appears "infinitely malleable" by defining control points and curves that the surface interpolates <ref> [WW92] </ref>. Terzopoulos and Qin developed D-NURBS: physically based, dynamic versions of NURBS curves and surfaces. Their approach also entails minimizing surface energy in the presence of applied forces and constraints.
