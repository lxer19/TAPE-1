Reference-contexts: The general idea underlying CBR is that, in order to process a new case, it is preferable (more efficient, more exact, faster ...) to use one or several cases processed before. The classical CBR cycle, as presented on figure 2, which has been inspired by Aamodt <ref> [1] </ref> and Bichin-daritz [2], follows five main steps: to abstract, to retrieve, to reuse, to revise and to retain. 2.1 Abstract The initial case representation is abstracted into an abstract case representation, in which the relevant features are calculated. The abstracted case is then matched with the cases in memory.

Reference-contexts: The memory of the system is composed of nodes of fours types: cases, concepts, prototypes and models. Concepts and models are organized in hierarchies dependent upon the points of view, which are some specialized models <ref> [3] </ref>. Cases are linked to concepts by instanciation links, while prototypes are linked to models by other instanciation links. Other parts of the object-model, not represented on this figure, deal with other elements such as indices, indexes, relations.

Watson and F. Mahrir (Edts.), </editor> <publisher> Springer-Verlag LNCS/LNAI, </publisher> <year> 1995, </year> <note> in press. </note>
Reference-contexts: These concepts can be defined in such a way that they correspond to the definition of classes. When concepts are used to gather, and index cases, such cases are instances of these classes, and then instanciation is a form of indexation <ref> [4] </ref>. The relations between CBR, classification-based reasoning and incremental concept learning (or categorization) have been studied by Napoli [8]. Conclusion A case-based reasoning system can be analyzed, designed and implemented following an OOM, with the well known advantages of such a methodology. It entails a better formalization of CBR.

Reference-contexts: The important effort of modeling permits to this step to be straightforward. 2 Case-Based Reasoning Methodology CBR is an AI methodology the purpose of which is to conceive and implement a computer system that reasons from past experiences <ref> [5] </ref>. It is grounded on a cognitive model: Schank's model of reasoning such that reasoning, memory and learning are closely linked [9]. A case is a set of empirical data.

Reference-contexts: An interesting challenge is that such a system can add classes during processing, by a dynamic abstraction from the cases. Machine learning inferences, such as an inductive method, permit to construct structures similar to classes. For example, incremental concept learning <ref> [6] </ref> can be used to learn concepts. These concepts can be defined in such a way that they correspond to the definition of classes. When concepts are used to gather, and index cases, such cases are instances of these classes, and then instanciation is a form of indexation [4].

Reference-contexts: Introduction Object-oriented methodology (OOM) and case-based reasoning methodology (CBR) have close roots in the 70's: frames for OOM <ref> [7] </ref> and scripts for CBR [10]. Although these methodologies have evolved independently since then, it is interesting to study how they have developped, and to compare them. So this paper studies the main characteristics of these methodologies, presents a CBR system built following OOM, and the advantages gained. <p> The purpose of OOM is to provide a methodology to build a computer program or system. It relies on Minsky's concept of frame (classes ancestor) <ref> [7] </ref> to represent knowledge. What has actually been transferred is the concept of class, and the central role played by the classification process (ie the organization of knowledge around classes, and the reasoning associated) in modeling. A class represents a set of objects sharing both common properties, and common behaviours.
