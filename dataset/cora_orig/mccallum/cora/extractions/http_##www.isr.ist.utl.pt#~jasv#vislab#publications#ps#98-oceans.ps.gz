Abstract: In this paper, we describe the automatic creation of video mosaics of the ocean floor, which deals with the problem of image motion estimation in a robust and automatic way. The motion estimation presented in this work is based on a initial matching of corresponding areas over pairs of images. As the error prone nature of the matching process is a commonly overlooked problem, this paper makes use of robust matching techniques, which can cope with an high percentage of wrong matches. In our approach, several motion models are established under the projective geometry framework, allowing the creation of high quality mosaics where no assumptions are made on the camera motion. This is an improvement over traditional approaches for underwater mosaicing, usually relying on the camera to be facing the sea floor, so that the image plane is approximately parallel to the floor plane.

The most commonly used camera model in computer vision is the pinhole model under which the camera performs a linear projective mapping from the projective space IP 3 to the projective plane IP 2 .

Reference-contexts: It can be easily shown <ref> [10, 4] </ref> that two different views of the same planar scene in 3-D space are related by a collineation in IP 2 , represented by a (3 fi 3) matrix 1 defined up to scale and establishing a one-to-one relation between corresponding points over two images. <p> In the work presented on this paper, we have used a two-step variant of LMedS, referred to as MEDSERE [5]. It exhibits a similar breakdown point but requires less random sampling in order to achieve the same degree of outlier rejection <ref> [4] </ref>. The MEDSERE algorithm comprises two phases of random sampling LMedS. After the first phase, the data set is reduced by selecting the best data points in the sense of the chosen cost function. Next, the reduced data undergoes another random sam pling LMedS phase. III.

Reference-contexts: In order to improve the correspondence finding, a number of points are selected corresponding to image corners or highly textured patches, using a simplified version of the well-known corner detector proposed by Harris and Stephens <ref> [6] </ref>. For each image I k , a set of features is extracted and matched directly on the following image I k+1 , using a correlation-based matching procedure and resulting in two lists of coordinates of corresponding points.

Reference-contexts: As it will be shown here, the association of robust methods and geometrical model based estimation, allows the creation of video mosaics even in the presence of moving objects and non-planar scenes. Research on automatic mosaic creation for underwater applications has been conducted in the last few years. In <ref> [7] </ref> a setup is proposed for creating mosaics by taking images at locations whose coordinates are known with high precision. Image merging can thus be performed without image analysis, because the frame-to-frame motion parameters can be computed directly 1 from the camera positions.

Reference-contexts: The most commonly used method is the least-squares mainly due to the ease of implementation and fast computation. The least-squares is optimal when the underlying error distribution of the data is Gaussian <ref> [9] </ref>. However, in many applications the data are not only noisy, but it also contains outliers, i.e. data in gross disagreement with the assumed model. <p> A widely used non-linear minimization method for dealing with outliers is the least-median-of-squares [11] (LMedS). The parameters for the planar transformation are estimated by solving min med i :t l where h T i is the i th row of the observations matrix H. As pointed out in <ref> [9] </ref>, this minimization problem cannot be reduced to a least-squares based solution. The minimization on the space of all possible solutions is usually impracticable. Therefore it is common practice to use a Monte Carlo technique and to analyze only a randomly sampled subsets of points.
