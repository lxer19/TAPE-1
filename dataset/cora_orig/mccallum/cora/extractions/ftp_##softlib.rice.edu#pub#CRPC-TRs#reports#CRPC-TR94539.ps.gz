Abstract: Certain finite difference methods on rectangular grids for second order elliptic equations are known to yield superconvergent flux approximations. A class of related finite difference methods have recently been defined for triangular meshes by applying special quadrature rules to an extended version of a mixed finite element method [1, 2]; the usual hybrid mixed method can also be applied to meshes of triangular and tetrahedral elements. Unfortunately, the flux vectors from these methods are only first order accurate. Empirical evidence indicates that a local postprocessing technique described in [11] recovers second order accurate velocities at special points. In this paper, a class of local postprocessing techniques generalizing the one in [11] are presented and analyzed. These postprocessors are shown to recover second order accurate velocity fields on three lines meshes. Numerical experiments illustrate these results and investigate more general situations, including meshes of tetrahedral elements. 1. Introduction. In this paper we discuss techniques for extracting additional

Reference-contexts: The right-triangle mesh was created from the square mesh by cutting each square into two right triangles by adding a line parallel to the line y = x. In all the cases in Table 1, K = I and Neumann boundary conditions were used. The Rice Unstructured Flow code <ref> [10] </ref>, a C++ implementation of various mixed finite element methods, was used to perform the experiments. Meshes were refined until they had between 2 fi 10 3 and 10 4 elements.

Keenan's PostProcessing Scheme. In this section we analyze the postpro cessing scheme defined in <ref> [11] </ref>. Corollary 6.1. The postprocessing scheme defined in [11] is second order accurate on interior triangles of a three lines mesh (when K is the identity), and is O (h 1:5 ) accurate overall. Proof: For triangles in the interior of a three lines mesh, this scheme constructs R (U ) at the center of the triangle. <p> Convergence is only first order, as expected, except on rectangles, where the superconvergence phenomenon increases the accuracy. The third column presents the convergence rate for the postprocessed fluxes on the triangular meshes using the postprocessor from <ref> [11] </ref>. The error measured here is jjR k (U) ujj l 2 , where R k is the reconstructed vector defined at the element centers. Convergence is at least O (h 1:5 ), and in some cases is close to second order. <p> Table 2 presents results in cases which violate at least one hypothesis of Lemma 4.1. In many cases, second order accuracy is retained, but in some cases it is lost. We omit the Uu vector error column, since it is always first order, and the postprocessor from <ref> [11] </ref>, since it was designed specifically for three lines meshes. In their place, we provide both l 2 and l 1 convergence rates for the least squares postprocessor and for the normal fluxes.

Reference-contexts: The rest of this paper is outlined as follows. In the next section, we give notation used throughout the paper. In section 3 we state the mixed finite element method. In section 4 we prove that the flux U computed from the mixed method is super-close to the -projection <ref> [13] </ref> of the true flux, on three lines triangular meshes. In section 5 we use that result to prove second order accuracy for all postprocessing methods satisfying certain conditions. In sections 6 and 7 we give examples of postprocessing schemes which satisfy those conditions. <p> Finally in section 8 we give experimental results illustrating these schemes. In most of the paper we assume that (1) was solved using the mixed finite element method with lowest-order Raviart-Thomas approximating spaces (RT 0 ) on triangular elements in two dimensions <ref> [13] </ref>. We remark on generalizations to the other methods described in [1, 2] in the final section of the paper. 2. Notation.

A Mixed Method. A mixed method is defined <ref> [13] </ref> by rewriting (1) as the pair u (x) = K (x)rp (x);(9) Multiplying (9)-(10) by appropriate test functions and integrating we obtain (K 1 u; v) = (p; r v); v 2 H 0 (div; );(11) We define V h = fv 2 V h : v ^n = g
