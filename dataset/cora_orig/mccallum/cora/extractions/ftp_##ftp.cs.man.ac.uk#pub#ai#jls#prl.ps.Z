Abstract: A formalism is developed for studying Genetic Algorithms by considering the evolution of the distribution of fitness in the population. The effects of selection on the population are problem independent. The formalism predicts the optimal amount of selection. Crossover is solved for a model problem finding low energy states of the one dimensional Ising spin glass. The theory is found to be in good agreement with simulations. To understand how GAs work, and thus to optimize their performance, it is necessary to understand their dynamics. Although a Genetic Algorithm can be described as a Markov Chain and thus solved formally [3], the effects of finite population make the transition probabilities very complicated. Consequently, this formulation has not yielded a predictive description of genetic dynamics. Another approach would be to exploit the well-known relationship between stochastic dynamics and the statistical mechanics of disordered systems. This is the subject of this paper. Statistical mechanics has already been applied to the study of other genetic dynamics (e.g. [4,5]). However, in these previous studies the selection of the individual to reproduce is random, there is no notion of fitness, whereas in GAs an individual reproduces with a probability determined by its fitness. In addition, the mechanisms of genetic mixing in the previous works were simpler than the crossover of the GA. In this letter we show that statistical mechanics can be used to predict the evolution of a GA. We show that selection can be understood in terms of Derrida's Random Energy Model [6]. To elucidate other aspects we study a toy problem finding low lying states of the one dimensional Ising spin glass. Here we just consider the two most important operations, selection and crossover. The techniques we have used can be readily extended to other problems and other GA operators. A fuller discussion will be given elsewhere [7]. The techniques developed here are useful in extending simple genetic and population models to include selection and crossover. In addition, they could have practical benefits to those applying GAs in optimization. This formulation predicts the evolution of the GA in terms of the amount of selection and other operators; this knowledge could help find the opti mal values of selection and crossover. As an example, many investigators have found that increasing the degree of selection as the population evolves considerably improves performance [8]. The statistical mechanics formulation predicts the optimal value of selection in terms of properties of distribution of fitness, and does show that this optimum should increase during evolution. By studying a problem with well defined statistical properties the techniques of statistical mechanics can be used to calculate the behaviour of a typical sample. The toy problem we examine is that of finding low lying states of a one dimensional spin glass with random nearest-neighbour couplings J i drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance. The energy for a configuration of spins, ~ S = (S 1 ; S 2 ; : : :; S N+1 ) is The ground state energy is E min = i jJ i j. Although this problem is trivial to solve, it is nevertheless interesting in that is has an exponential number of local minima under single spin flip dynamics (typically 2 N=3 ). Its thermodynamic properties have been extensively studied, see for example [9,10]. In its most basic form GAs work as follows: a populations of solutions, each represented by a string, is generated at random; the fitness of the solutions are measured and the fitter solutions are selected for; these fit solutions are combined in pairs to form new solutions; a random mutation can be applied; the fitness of the new solutions are tested and the selection, crossover and mutation is repeated; the algorithm finishes when the fitness of the population stops improving. Many modification to this basic scheme are possible. For example, members of one generation can be transferred to the next generation without any modifications. These enhancements can be studied within this formalism. As an example we consider a GA to find the low lying states of a spin glass chain. The chain is represented by the vector of spins, ~ S a , where a = 1; : : :P labels the different members of the population. The vectors of spins could be the strings used fl Published in Phys. Rev.
