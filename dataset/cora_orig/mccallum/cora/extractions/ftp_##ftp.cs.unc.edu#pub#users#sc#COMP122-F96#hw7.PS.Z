Abstract: P-1 Prove or give a counter-example: provided that each coin in the series is worth at least twice the next lower denomination, that the series includes a 1-unit coin, and that an unlimited supply of coins of each denomination is available, the greedy algorithm for making change always finds an optimal solution. i=1 d(v i-1 ; v i ). A shortest path from u to v is a path from u to v of minimum length. Vertex 1 is designated the source, and we want to find the shortest path from the source to each of the other vertices of the graph. The following greedy algorithm claims to find the lengths of these shortest paths. The distance function is given as a two-dimensional array D, such that D[u][v] = d(u; v) if (u; v) 2 E, and D[u][v] = 1 otherwise.
