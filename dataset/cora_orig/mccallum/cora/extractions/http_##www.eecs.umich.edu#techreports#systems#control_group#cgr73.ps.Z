Title: Identification in H 1 with Nonuniformly Spaced Frequency Response Measurements  
Author: Huseyin Ak~cay, Guoxiang Gu and Pramod P. Khargonekar 
Date: May 1991  
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of "system identification in H 1 " is investigated in the case when the given frequency response data is not necessarily on a uniformly spaced grid of frequencies. A large class of robustly convergent identification algorithms are derived. A particular algorithm is further examined and explicit worst case error bounds (in the H 1 norm) are derived for both discrete-time and continuous-time systems. Examples are provided to illustrate the application of the algorithms.

Reference-contexts: In these papers, significant progress has been made on various aspects of the problem of system identification in H 1 . While much of the work so far focused on the discrete-time systems, robustly convergent algorithms have been recently developed for the continuous-time systems <ref> [9, 1] </ref>. In much of the literature on the problem of system identification in H 1 , it is assumed that the given frequency response data is on a uniformly spaced grid of frequencies. This assumption is made for the discrete-time systems. <p> One advantage of the approach taken in [6, 7] is that under some fairly general conditions, one gets not just one but a large family of robustly convergent identification algorithms. In this paper, we take the approach developed in <ref> [1, 6, 7] </ref> and obtain a family of robustly convergent algorithms even when the frequency response data is not necessarily on a uniformly spaced grid of frequencies. <p> This class can be described by the following equations (see [9] and <ref> [1] </ref>): H (; K) := f ^ h : ^ h analytic and j ^ h (s)j K in Re (s) &gt; g; (5.1) H (; K; ) := f ^ h 2 H (; K) : j ^ h (j!)j (!); 1 &lt; ! &lt; 1g: In the above description, <p> We refer the interested reader to <ref> [9, 1] </ref> 16 for more details on this class of systems. Similar classes of systems also arose in the work of Zames [33] on the entropy and metric complexity of linear systems which was partially motivated by the problems of identification theory. <p> To be more specific, let S (; K; ) := f ^ h d : ^ h d (z) = ^ h ( (z)); ^ h 2 H (; K; )g: (5.2) Then S (; K; ) is a subset of A. It was shown <ref> [1] </ref> that S (; K; ) is admissible. Hence given a dense sequence f N g 1 N=1 on [0; ], any extended two-stage algorithm A N with a window function w n;k satisfying the conditions (i) (iii) in Theorem 3.7 will be robustly convergent for S (; K; ). <p> jj ); jj 2 g) + (5.4) s n m )[maxf 24K =2 j!j ! )g + m Proof: We modified the following from [9] 17 sup k ^ h d L N k 1 maxf max jj ); N jj 2 g: (5.5) For m 1, we have, from <ref> [1] </ref>, that ffi 2m ffi 2m1 maxf 24K =2 j!j ! )g + m Equations (5.5), (5.6) and Theorem 3.8 imply (5.4). <p> + 5) The noise is generated according to the model ^ k = 0:1r k e j2 k ; k = 1; 2; :::; N; (6.2) where fr k ; k ; k = 1; :::; N g is a collection of independent random variables uniformly distributed on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> system ^ h 2 (s) = q p : (6.5) The noise is generated according to the model (6.2) with r k = 1; k = 1; :::; N: The identification of this system for equally spaced circular frequencies as obtained through by the bilinear mapping (1.3) was investigated in <ref> [1] </ref>. In this example, we considered the frequency response estimates (2.4), at arbitrarily chosen frequencies: ! i = 0:005 (i 1); ! 20+i = 0:1 + 0:045 (i 1); ! 40+i = 1 + 0:45 (i 1); i = 1; :::; 20; and linearly interpolated the data after ! 100.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that we have assumed the frequency response data on a finite subset of [0; ]. Since our systems are real, the frequency response satisfies the usual complex conjugate symmetry property, which will be used to get the frequency response on the corresponding subset of <ref> [; 2] </ref> . In the above formulation, we have taken the noise bound to be frequency independent. It is possible to consider a frequency dependent noise bound by introducing a suitable weighting function.

Definition 2.1 A subset S A is called admissible, if 1. lim ffi n = 0; where ffi n := sup E n ( ^ h) = sup inffk ^ h ^p n k 1 : ^p n 2 P n g : ^ h 2 S o 2. <p> A proof of the above lemma can be found in the Appendix. 5 3 Extended Two-Stage Nonlinear Algorithms In this section, we will describe the extended two-stage nonlinear algorithm and study its robust convergence. The algorithm proposed here is different from <ref> [6] </ref>, where it is assumed that the frequency response data are available on a uniformly spaced grid of frequencies, so that the DFT technique is readily applicable. <p> a standard procedure, we will not dwell on it. (See Section 5 for a brief discussion.) Finally, observe that the extended two-stage nonlinear algorithm is untuned. 3.3 Preliminary Error Analysis Define the worst case identification error in Stage 1 as e N ^2B N (*); ^ h2S E;N Definition 3.4 <ref> [6] </ref> Stage 1 of the extended two-stage algorithm is said to be convergent if lim N!1 pi (*) = 0; (3.16) and robustly convergent if in addition, the algorithm converges for every choice of dense sequence f N g 1 We can write ~ h M (k) in (3.9) as ~ <p> The following lemma is an extension of Lemma 2.4 in <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> Ideally, we would like to find an algorithm that simultaneously minimizes three components of the worst case identification error in Stage 1. In <ref> [6] </ref>, for uniformly spaced frequency response data case, a trade-off between the worst case noise and approximation errors is studied. <p> In addition, the trade-offs between the worst case interpolation and noise errors and between the worst case interpolation and approximation errors enter into the picture. The importance of Stage 1 of the nonlinear algorithm is clear from the following lemma <ref> [6, 8] </ref>. Lemma 3.6 The two-stage nonlinear algorithm is robustly convergent if Stage 1 is robustly con vergent. <p> This window function was studied in <ref> [6] </ref> which provides the trade-off between the worst case approximation error and the worst case noise error in terms of parameter m for the uniformly spaced frequency response data case. <p> It is also easy to see that S must be a proper subset of A for the robust convergence of the extended two stage nonlinear algorithm. The above discussion also applies to the two-stage nonlinear algorithm studied in <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. 4 Exponentially Stable Discrete-Time Systems In this section, we will apply our results in the last section to a particular admissible set of discrete time systems and obtain explicit worst case error bounds. <p> Thus, the systems in this class are exponentially stable with a decay rate of 1 and gain bounded by G. This class of systems has been investigated fairly extensively in the literature on identification in H 1 <ref> [8, 10, 6, 5, 20, 23, 24] </ref>. The following theorem gives worst case identification error bounds of our extended two-stage nonlinear algorithm for H (D ; G). Theorem 4.1 Consider the class of the systems H (D ; G). <p> This is in significant contrast to the case of uniform frequency grids where convergence is exponential <ref> [6, 24] </ref>. We believe that this is partly due to the nature of the algorithm, and partly due to the 15 fact that we have made no assumptions on the frequency grid other than asymptotic denseness. It is conceivable that some other algorithm might achieve faster convergence.

Reference-contexts: Many of these papers deal with what may be broadly termed as "robust identification". The subject of this paper is a particular worst case deterministic identification problem the so called problem of "system identification in H 1 " which was introduced by Helmicki, Jacobson and Nett <ref> [8] </ref>. In this problem formulation, the experimental data are taken to be the values of the frequency response of the unknown system at a given finite set of frequencies.

It is possible to consider a frequency dependent noise bound by introducing a suitable weighting function.

However, our results in this paper are quite different from those in [19]. The robustly convergent algorithms that have been proposed in the literature for solving the problem of identification in H 1 share a common "two-stage" structure which first appeared in [8]. In a recent paper [6], these two-stage algorithms have been investigated in much detail.

In that case, the order of the approximation will increase with the smoothness of the class S of the functions being approximated up to the saturation limit <ref> [27] </ref>. However, the worst case noise error bounds will, in general, be larger. We will close this section with some remarks on model reduction. For practical examples, it will usually be necessary to perform model reduction on ^ h N id to obtain low order system model.
