Reference-contexts: CLARE: GENERAL PURPOSE LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING In this section, we first outline CLARE's architecture and then describe the adaptation of CLARE to the new domain following the given architectural plan. Finally, we describe the method used to model the Autoroute-WOZ dialogues. CLARE <ref> [1] </ref> is a wide-coverage natural language processing system with facilities for reasoning and understanding in context and for generating cooperative responses. CLARE accepts input from AURIX either as a string of words or in lattice form. CLARE's processing then includes the following stages.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, contextual influences are brought to bear in the further stages of reference resolution (for example, resolving noun-phrase anaphors and ellipses) and quantifier scoping. These stages instantiate variables in the context-independent QLF and generate monotonically a context dependent QLF <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: the senses of the linguistic predicates used in the input sentence, is translated first into a form suitable for reasoning with (Target Reasoning Language - TRL) and thence, using a declaratively stated domain model, into an expression with concepts related to the particular domain with which the intended application deals <ref> [3] </ref>. 4.1 Context-Independent Processing Adaptation of CLARE's context independent processing stages (lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis) has consisted of straightforward extensions to the system's general lexicon and grammar.

Reference-contexts: (London) will be provably false and the utterance will be translated, by another rule, into a command whose parameters include London as a place enroute to be departed at 6pm. 4.4 Dialogue Modelling The dialogues in the the Autoroute-WOZ corpus are mod-elled using the concepts of conversational game and move <ref> [4] </ref> [5]. Dialogue structure is predicted to arise from the (usually) non-linguistic goals of the participants. Each conversational game has a shared goal - e.g. for a `questioning game' the goal is to find out some information - and consists of a number of conversational moves.

Reference-contexts: The wizard's voice was disguised to encourage this belief. In an initial experiment the route planning service was advertised widely throughout DRA in an attempt to elicit genuine enquiries <ref> [6] </ref>. However the response was disappointing, resulting in only 66 conversations. Hence in a second phase subjects were targeted with a request to help evaluate the interface to the system. Each subject was provided with a route planning "scenario" [13]. <p> Each subject was provided with a route planning "scenario" [13]. Clearly the behaviour of the wizard will have a great influence on the nature of the resulting corpus, and this issue is discussed in detail in <ref> [6] </ref>. It is also known that the wording of any instructions in such experiments can significantly bias the way in which participants choose to express their queries, and this was also given careful consideration, for example through the use of pictorial rather than orthographic cues [13].

Reference-contexts: By the end of the experiment a further 183 calls, of which 141 were route-planning enquiries, had been received from 143 different people. 3. AURIX: GENERAL PURPOSE SPEECH RECOGNITION AURIX is a reconfigurable extension of the ARMADA real-time continuous speech recognition system <ref> [7] </ref> which has been developed at the DRA Speech Research Unit. Classification is based on a set of context-sensitive phoneme-level continuous-density hidden Markov models (HMMs) of acoustic speech patterns. These models are optimised with respect to the training set using a standard sub-word HMM embedded training algorithm.

Reference-contexts: During recognition word-level HMMs are obtained by concatenating the phoneme-level HMMs according to a baseform pronunciation dictionary. Recognition is performed using a one-pass dynamic programming algorithm with beam search and partial traceback <ref> [8] </ref> to obtain the most probable explanation of the acoustic data in terms of the output of a sequence of HMMs.

Reference-contexts: Recognition is performed using a one-pass dynamic programming algorithm with beam search and partial traceback [8] to obtain the most probable explanation of the acoustic data in terms of the output of a sequence of HMMs. An extension of this algorithm <ref> [9] </ref> can be used to extract a data structure based on multi ple explanations of the acoustic pattern which provides a richer interface with the CLARE system.

Reference-contexts: Firstly, most phoneme-level HMM based systems use context-sensitive models to explicitly account for the dependency of the acoustic realisation of a particular phoneme on the (phonemic) context in which it occurs in continuous speech. Typically triphone HMMs <ref> [10] </ref> are used where it is assumed that the only significant contextual effects are due to the immediately preceding and following phonemes (thus the phoneme /O/ in the word /tOk/ ("talk") is represented by the triphone (O:t k) corresponding to /O/ preceded by /t/ and followed by /k/).

Reference-contexts: In the current version of AURIX a Phoneme Decision Tree based approach is used to identify equivalence classes of contexts which induce the same contextual effect on the realisation of a given phoneme, and to map unambiguously arbitrary new contexts onto these equivalence classes <ref> [11] </ref>. Secondly, in a task-dependent training set with a relatively small vocabulary particular triphones may only occur in a very limited number of wider contexts (for example they may be word-specific). In such cases the HMMs are not true triphones, but implicitly model the influence of the wider context.

Reference-contexts: The current training set consists of speech from 321 subjects, each speaking 10 sentences from 460 sentences based on the SCRIBE sentence set <ref> [12] </ref>. For purposes of comparison a "customised" model set has also been developed using a training set comprising a subset of the Autoroute corpus described earlier. 4.

Reference-contexts: Since the intention is to study genuine spoken interactions, an important issue is to motivate subjects to participate in the collection of such a corpus. Therefore a suitable application must be found. The application chosen was that of telephone-based route planning, based on the commercially available "Autoroute" software package <ref> [14] </ref>. A Wizard of Oz (WOZ) experiment was conducted at the Speech Research Unit to elicit a corpus of spoken UK road route planning enquiries.
