Reference-contexts: In this report, we do not undertake to make a detailed assessment of the overall state of theoretical computer science or to fully chronicle the achievements of this field. These essential tasks will require a continual effort involving many members of the TOC community. The Loui report <ref> [3] </ref> is a good first step in this direction. For the sake of emphasis this report often states our recommendations in prescriptive language.

Reference-contexts: We have selected areas where there is a good possibility of attracting funding from sources which have not traditionally supported theoretical computer science. Our recommendations should be read in conjunction with those of Raghavan <ref> [4] </ref>, who has provided an excellent overview of the opportunities for application-oriented theory.
