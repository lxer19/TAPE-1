Abstract: Association Rule Mining algorithms operate on a data matrix (e.g., customers fi products) to derive association rules [2, 23]. We propose a new paradigm, namely, Ratio Rules, which are quantifiable in that we can measure the "goodness" of a set of discovered rules. We propose to use the "guessing error" as a measure of the "goodness", that is, the root-mean-square error of the reconstructed values of the cells of the given matrix, when we pretend that they are unknown. Another contribution is a novel method to guess missing/hidden values from the Ratio Rules that our method derives. For example, if somebody bought $10 of milk and $3 of bread, our rules can "guess" the amount spent on, say, butter. Thus, we can perform a variety of important tasks such as forecasting, answering "what-if" scenarios, detecting outliers, and visualizing the data. Moreover, we show how to compute Ratio Rules in a single pass over the dataset with small memory requirements (a few small matrices), in contrast to traditional association rule mining methods that require multiple passes and/or large memory.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 presents the results from experiments. Section 6 provides a discussion. Finally, Section 7 gives some conclusions and pointers to future work. 2 Related Work Agrawal et al. distinguish between three data mining problems: identifying classifications, finding sequential patterns, and discovering association rules <ref> [1] </ref>. We review only material relevant to the latter, since it is the focus of this paper. See [9] for an excellent, recent survey of all three problems. The seminal work of [2] introduced the problem of discovering association rules and presented an efficient algorithm for mining them.

Since then, new serial algorithms [4, 16, 20] and parallel algorithms [3] have been proposed.

Related issues include outlier detection and forecasting. <p> We assume that C can fit in memory: it needs M 2 cells, where M is the number of columns, which should typically be on the order of one thousand for real applications <ref> [2] </ref>. Under this assumption, we can compute the column averages and the covariance matrix with a single-pass over the N ( millions) of rows of the given X matrix, using the algorithm of Figure 2 (a). <p> Association Rules Ratio Rules are quite different from association rules in many qualitative aspects. Here we compare and contrast the two paradigms. Of the association rules, we examine both Boolean and quantitative rules. Examples of each type of rule with which we are concerned follow: * Boolean association rules <ref> [2] </ref>: fbread; milkg ) butter * quantitative association rules [23]: bread : [2 5] ) butter : [1 2] * Ratio Rules: ratio of spendings bread:butter = 2:3 Boolean association rules have the advantages that they are easy to interpret and relatively easy to implement.

Reference-contexts: The details of the choice of training and testing sets are orthogonal to our definition, and outside the scope of this paper, since they have been extensively examined in the machine learning and classification literature <ref> [18] </ref>. A reasonable choice is to use 90% of the original data matrix for training and the remaining 10% for testing. Another possibility is the use the entire data matrix for both training and testing.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the proposed method is applicable to any N fi M matrix, with a variety of interpretations for the rows and columns, e.g., patients and medical test measurements (blood pressure, body weight, etc.); documents and terms (typical in IR <ref> [19] </ref>), etc. Each row vector of the matrix can be thought of as an M -dimensional point. Given this set of N points, eigensystem analysis identifies the axes (orthogonal directions) of greatest variance, after centering the points about the origin.
