Title: Texture Segmentation of SAR Images

Abstract: The image surface of synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR) is dominated locally by peaks and clusters of peaks, especially in terrain and vegetation areas. More globally, there are extended regions distinguishable by texture, trees, fields, shadows, roads, etc. We describe an algorithm which segments SAR images into a set of regions of pre-specified classes, based on two procedures: first, the classification of peaks into N = 3 pre-specified classes, and second, a segmentation of the Delaunay triangulation of peaks into connected regions. A peak detection operator is used to estimate peaks in SAR images; thresholds are determined by using the histogram of the peak amplitude of each class. Peak amplitude was found to be the most useful discriminant by far in the multi-variate distribution in peak amplitude, peak width, and peak density. A Delaunay triangulation was established on the peaks of each class. Links in the triangulation were removed if they were unlikely for a population of that class. The boundary of a texture region is the boundary of a connected component of the modified Delaunay triangulation of the appropriate class of peaks. Linking by boundary traversal was developed to extract closed boundaries of each class. Experimental and simulation results are presented in SAR and synthesized images, respectively. Boundaries of regions can be determined to an accuracy of about 2 pixels.

Reference-contexts: In some domains, boundary detectors identify boundaries between surfaces with uniform reflectivity as oriented edgel discontinuities of order zero or one in the image intensity surface (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>). Some special SAR images containing smooth objects (e.g. sea ice) can be segmented by an edgel-based operator [2]. Unfortunately, this kind of edgel-based algorithm can not be applied to general SAR images very generally because various features, either natural or man-made, are dominated by peaks.

Reference-contexts: A peak-based texture segmentation operator is thus important for SAR images. This paper develops a new algorithm to extract closed boundaries of various features in SAR images. N classes of peaks, in our case tree, ground, and shadow, are extracted by a peak detector <ref> [3] </ref> and classified by thresholds. For an image including one single class of peaks, peak densities can be determined from distances of neigh bors, thus from lengths of links in the Delaunay tri-angulation; from this it determines discontinuities in peak density. <p> In Section 3, the algorithm for texture segmentation is presented. In Section 4, the performance of this operator is examined in synthesized and real SAR images. segmentation algorithm. 2 Peak Detection and Classification of Peaks A peak detector developed in previous work <ref> [3] </ref> is used to extract peak position, width and amplitude in SAR images. <p> peak spacing for pre-specified classes of peaks, thresholds are determined interactively to distinguish groups of peaks, in our case, shadow, trees, and grass. 2.1 Peak Detection Extended elements in SAR images consist of many narrow peaks generated from imaged point scat-terers, with the SAR impulse modeled by two-dimensional Gaussian functions <ref> [3] </ref>. Experimentally, the assumption of separable Gaussian peaks (see Eq.(1)) for narrow peaks is correct.

Reference-contexts: This whole algorithm is shown in Figure 1 and described in the following three stages: * Stage 1: Delaunay Triangulation A triangulation of P is defined as a maximal planar subdivision to interpolate a terrain given P sample of points <ref> [4] </ref>. Given a set P of points in the plane, any locally and globally equiangular triangulation of P is the Delaunay triangulation of P . Therefore, the optimal approximation of a terrain can be achieved by the Delau-nay triangulation.
