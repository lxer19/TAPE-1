Abstract: The design and analysis of series, merge, and splitting topologies of M/G/C/C state dependent queueing networks is presented and an analytical approximation methodology is developed to compute the network performance measures. Also, an optimization methodology is developed for determining the optimal capacity requirements of these networks and extensive experimental results are included.

Reference-contexts: Fruin also proposes that the capacity of a corridor with bi-directional traffic is nearly equal to that of a unidirectional corridor. Cheah <ref> [7] </ref> provides exponential walking speed models for bi- and multi-directional flows. These models are similar in form to the uni-directional model for pedestrian walking speeds, except that the values for two parameters are slightly changed. <p> Cheah <ref> [7] </ref> shows that M/M/C/C and M/G/C/C state dependent queues are stochastically equivalent, and develops the limiting probabilities for the number of pedestrians in an M/G/C/C state dependent queueing model. <p> Therefore, for analyzing the performance measures associated with M/G/C/C state dependent queueing networks, it is necessary to use methods such as simulation or approximation techniques. Simulation was used by Cheah <ref> [7] </ref> to compute the performance measures of M/G/C/C state dependent series topologies consisting of two and three nodes.

Reference-contexts: From the plot, it appears that the objective value is maximized when the corridor width is somewhere between 4.6 and 4.7 meters. For determining this corridor width value that maximizes the objective value of 100fi - 10W for this corridor, Powell's Unconstrained Optimization Algorithm, as presented in Himmelblau <ref> [18] </ref>, was implemented. This optimal corridor width was determined to be 4.6592 meters, with an objective value of 453.2244. In Figure 12, the revenue per ped/sec through the corridor is again 100, but the corridor floor area cost per square meter is raised to 10.

Reference-contexts: Tregenza states that at a mean density of 3 pedestrians per square meter (ped/m 2 ), walking is reduced to a shu*e, and at 5 ped/m 2 , forward movement is halted. Based on these empirical curves, Yuhaski and Smith <ref> [35] </ref> have developed linear and exponential analytical models for uni-directional walking speeds as a function of the number of pedestrians in a corridor. 2.2 Congestion Model The congestion model for uni-directional traffic flow through corridors, developed by Yuhaski and Smith [35], deals with the average walking speed of a pedestrian, V <p> Based on these empirical curves, Yuhaski and Smith <ref> [35] </ref> have developed linear and exponential analytical models for uni-directional walking speeds as a function of the number of pedestrians in a corridor. 2.2 Congestion Model The congestion model for uni-directional traffic flow through corridors, developed by Yuhaski and Smith [35], deals with the average walking speed of a pedestrian, V n , as a function of the number of pedestrians, n, occupying the corridor, and the corridor capacity, C. <p> The exponential model for uni-directional flow presented by Yuhaski and Smith <ref> [35] </ref> is as follows: Exponential Model : V n = A exp h fi where fl = ln ln (V a =A) b 1 fi = [ln (A=V a )] 1=fl = [ln (A=V b )] 1=fl A = V 1 = 1.5 m/s V b = 0.25 b = 2*L*W <p> If there is an arrival to the corridor, and that pedestrian enters the corridor, the service rate will change to f (n + 1): Likewise, if a pedestrian traverses the length of the corridor and leaves the system, the service rate will change to f (n 1): Yuhaski and Smith <ref> [35] </ref> developed the limiting probabilities for the number of pedestrians in a M/M/C/C queueing model. Cheah [7] shows that M/M/C/C and M/G/C/C state dependent queues are stochastically equivalent, and develops the limiting probabilities for the number of pedestrians in an M/G/C/C state dependent queueing model.
