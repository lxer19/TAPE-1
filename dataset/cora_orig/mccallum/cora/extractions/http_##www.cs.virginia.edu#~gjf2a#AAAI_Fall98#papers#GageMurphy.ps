Abstract: This paper presents work in progress on an algorithm for allocating sensing resources for an autonomous mobile robot in the presence of incomplete information. It makes a novel addition to the MIN-CONFLICT which maximizes each behavior's preference for a particular sensor ("happiness"). Simulations show that MIN-CONFLICT with Happiness is better able to satisfy more sequences of requests while maximizing happiness than three other methods.
