Abstract: An approach to Language Identification (LID) based on language-dependent phone recognition is presented in this paper. A variety of features and their combinations extracted by language-dependent recognizers were evaluated based on the same database. Two novel information sources for LID were introduced: (1) forward and backward bigram based language models, and (2) context-dependent duration models. An LID system using Hidden Markov Models and neural network was developed. The system was trained and evaluated using the OGI TS database. For a six-language task, the system performance(correct rate) for 45-second long utterances and 10-second long utterances reached 91.96% and 81.08% respectively. The experiments demonstrated the importance of detailed modeling and the method by which these information sources are combined.

Reference-contexts: Their work showed that the constraints could be a powerful feature to distinguish the languages even when the speech events were described by broad-category classes. This idea has been used extensively in recent research [1,2,3], and reflects the phonotactic differences between different languages [7]. Our previous work <ref> [2] </ref> showed that fine phone categories could lead to better performance than broad categories. Therefore, fine phone categories are used in this work.

Reference-contexts: Duration model Duration modeling has been used in <ref> [3] </ref> to capture a certain class of prosodic information in the different languages. Two representations of duration distribution for each phone were evaluated initially, namely * Gaussian densities and * Histograms Initial experiments showed the performance of these two representations were almost the same. <p> Final classifier When multiple information sources are used, an important issue is how the sources should be combined to make a classification. One approach is to assume that all the information sources are independent probability estimators, so that log probabilities can be added as in <ref> [3] </ref>. In order to avoid these assumptions, a fully-connected, feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer is used to learn the relations among these scores in our system. The classifier was trained on both the training sets and the development set with conjugate gradient optimization [10]. 5.

Reference-contexts: M (O i ) is its corresponding HMM model. ~ f is the set of features in the decoded ith segment, initiated at time b i , ended at time e i . T is the number of phones in the decoded path. 2.2. Language model House and Neuburg <ref> [6] </ref> proposed that sequential constraints on phonemes could be exploited as an efficient approach to language identification. Their work showed that the constraints could be a powerful feature to distinguish the languages even when the speech events were described by broad-category classes.

Reference-contexts: T is the total number of phones in the decoded utterance. This language model is based on the interpolated n-gram language model proposed in <ref> [8] </ref>. It exploits left context information; thus only the forward information is captured. Although a trigram-based language model can capture both the right and left context information, a larger database is needed in order to get a well estimated model.
