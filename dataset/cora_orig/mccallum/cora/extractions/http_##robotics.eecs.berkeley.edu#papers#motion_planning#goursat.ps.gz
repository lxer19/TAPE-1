Abstract: The theme of this paper is the generalization of Goursat normal forms for Pfaffian systems with co-dimension greater than two. There are necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of coordinates that transform a Pfaffian system with co-dimension greater than two into an extended Goursat normal form, which is the dual of the multiple-chain, single-generator chained form mentioned in our earlier work. In this paper, we concentrate on how to find such coordinate transformations for multi-steering, multi-trailer mobile robot systems so that we can use available steering and stabilization algorithms for nonholonomic motion planning. We present a methodology for constructing a coordinate transformation and apply it to the example of a five-axle, two-steering mobile robot.

Reference-contexts: The dual to the chained form, in the sense of one-forms, is the Goursat normal form. Although the mathematics literature abounds with the theory of exterior differential systems (we recommend <ref> [1, 4, 13] </ref> as a survey), only recently have there been attempts to apply this machinery to solve general control problems in steering nonholonomic systems. <p> In Section 5, conclusions are made. 2. Background We now present some of the mathematical tools from exterior differential algebra that are used in this paper. A more thorough presentation can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. An n-dimensional Pfaffian system, denoted by I, is the differential system ff 0 = ff 1 = : : : = ff n1 = 0 ; (1) where the constraints, or one-forms, are the directions in which the system cannot move instantaneously. Our first tool is the derived flag. <p> For co-dimension two systems, or systems with only one tower, the transformation is straightforward: the generator coordinate, z 0 and the coordinate for the bottom of the tower, z s 1 +1 are found from the solution to Pfaff's problem <ref> [1] </ref>. Then the rest of the coordinates are found through differentiation. This was presented in [10]. <p> Therefore, we can use the solution to Pfaff's problem <ref> [1] </ref> to compute the coordinates for the first tower of the normal form as follows: (i) Define df 1 := .

Reference-contexts: The constraints can be written as ff i = 0, where the ff i are one-forms on the configuration space. Classical motion planning problem solutions assume that the system can move in all directions at a point and are inadequate for systems with velocity constraints. In previous work <ref> [2, 6, 9] </ref>, nonholonomic systems were considered not from the point of view of their constraints, but rather from the point of view of a control system with the allowable motions in the span of the input vector fields. <p> In [3], they did not state this since their was always dt. The extended Goursat normal form is the dual of the multiple-input, single-generator chained form presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> is written as _z 0 = u 0 _z 1 1 = u m 2 = z 1 2 = z m . . . . . . s m +1 = z m _z 1 s j u 0 Sufficient conditions for converting to this form were given in <ref> [2] </ref>; the conditions stated above, however, are both necessary and sufficient. 3. Coordinate Transformation to Extended Goursat Normal Form If the constraints of the system (1) satisfy the Goursat congruences (3), by Theorem 1 we know there exist coordinates for the extended Goursat normal form.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [3] </ref>, they did not state this since their was always dt. The extended Goursat normal form is the dual of the multiple-input, single-generator chained form presented in [2]. <p> We present here a purely algebraic algorithm for finding the coordinates. The algorithm is similar to the one used in <ref> [3] </ref> for linearization to Brunovsky normal form. For co-dimension two systems, or systems with only one tower, the transformation is straightforward: the generator coordinate, z 0 and the coordinate for the bottom of the tower, z s 1 +1 are found from the solution to Pfaff's problem [1].

Reference-contexts: Although the mathematics literature abounds with the theory of exterior differential systems (we recommend [1, 4, 13] as a survey), only recently have there been attempts to apply this machinery to solve general control problems in steering nonholonomic systems. In <ref> [10] </ref>, we used techniques from exterior differential algebra to find a coordinate transformation for the N-trailer system that put the co-dimension two Pfaffian system into Goursat normal form. In this paper we use exterior differential algebra to convert Pfaffian systems of co-dimension greater than two into extended Goursat normal form. <p> Then the rest of the coordinates are found through differentiation. This was presented in <ref> [10] </ref>. The difficulty with having more than one tower is that we must modify the constraints to decouple the towers so that we can use the solution to Pfaff's problem to find the coordinates for each tower.
