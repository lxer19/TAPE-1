Abstract: We propose a new service discipline, called the Rate-Controlled Static-Priority (RCSP) queueing discipline, that can provide throughput, delay, delay jitter, and loss free guarantees in a connection-oriented packet-switching network. Previously proposed solutions are based on either a time-framing strategy, or a sorted priority queue mechanism. Time-framing schemes suffer from the dependencies they introduce between the queueing delay and the granularity of bandwidth allocation; sorted priority queues are more complex, and may be difficult to implement. The proposed RCSP queueing discipline avoids both time-framing and sorted priority queues; it achieves flexibility in the allocation of delay and bandwidth, as well as simplicity of implementation. The key idea is to separate rate-control and delay-control functions in the design of the server. Applying this separation of functions will result in a class of service disciplines, of which RCSP is an instance.

Reference-contexts: The stand-by queue allows the non-eligible packets to stand by at the scheduler, so that they can be transmitted when there is spare capacity at the output link. Similar ideas have been independently proposed in <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. Notice that with the introduction of the stand-by queue, the service discipline becomes work-conserving. It can be easily shown that Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 still hold for the work-conserving RCSP with exception to the statements on delay-jitter and buffer space.

Reference-contexts: A relevant issue here is that of jitter control. In the literature, there are different definitions of jitter. In [12], the term is used to capture the burstiness of the traffic, and is defined to be the maximum number of packets in a jitter averaging interval. In <ref> [6, 18] </ref>, the term is used to capture the magnitude of the distortion to the traffic pattern caused by the network, and is defined to be the maximum difference between the delays experienced by any two packets on the same connection. <p> From the network's point of view, the partial reconstruction of traffic patterns, or rate-jitter control inside the network, may be enough to offset the interactions between switches and the network load fluctuations; however, for some applications, a delay-jitter-free service is required <ref> [6, 7, 18] </ref>. If the network does not control delay jitter, applications may have to do buffering at the destination. For this reason, delay jitter control inside the network may be preferred; however, this consideration has to be balanced against the relative complexities of implementing delay-jitter control vs. rate-jitter control. <p> This requires clients to specify their traffic characteristics. For this discussion, we use the (X min ; X ave ; I; P ) traffic characterization as suggested in <ref> [9, 6] </ref>, where X min is the minimum packet inter-arrival time, X ave is the average packet inter-arrival time over an averaging interval, I is the length of the interval, and P is the maximum packet size. <p> From the network's point of view, rate-jitter control or partial reconstruction of traffic patterns inside the network is sufficient to control the interaction between switches and the network load fluctuations. However, delay-jitter control may be preferred when a delay jitter bounded service is desired <ref> [6, 7, 18] </ref>. The important consideration here regards the relative complexities of implementing delay-jitter control vs. rate-jitter control.

Reference-contexts: The First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) discipline, which is used in most conventional networks, may be capable of providing some performance guarantees, but only under a number of constraints and with a very inefficient use of the network's resources <ref> [8] </ref>. New service disciplines that aim to provide different qualities of service to different connections have been proposed. These include Delay Earliest-Due-Date (Delay-EDD) [9], Virtual Clock [20], Fair Queueing [5] and its weighted version [15], Jitter Earliest-Due-Date (Jitter-EDD) [18], Stop-and-Go [10], and Hierarchical Round Robin (HRR) [12].

Reference-contexts: It has been argued that a connection-oriented architecture, with explicit resource allocation and connection admission control, is needed to offer such a real-time service <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> New service disciplines that aim to provide different qualities of service to different connections have been proposed. These include Delay Earliest-Due-Date (Delay-EDD) <ref> [9] </ref>, Virtual Clock [20], Fair Queueing [5] and its weighted version [15], Jitter Earliest-Due-Date (Jitter-EDD) [18], Stop-and-Go [10], and Hierarchical Round Robin (HRR) [12]. These solutions are based on either a time-framing strategy, or a sorted priority queue mechanism. <p> This may not be feasible in a high-speed implementation. Also, in order to decouple scheduling priority and bandwidth allocation, a scheme based on a sorted priority queue requires a complicated schedulability test at connection establishment time <ref> [9, 19] </ref>, which is not needed in time-framing-based schemes like Stop-and-Go and HRR. In this paper, we present a new service discipline called Rate-Controlled Static-Priority (RCSP) queueing that overcomes these limitations. <p> Finally, we give conclusions and outline future work in section 6. 2 Background We consider the paradigm proposed in <ref> [9] </ref> for providing guaranteed service to clients in a packet switching network: before communication starts, the client specifies its traffic characteristics and performance requirements to the network; the client's traffic and performance parameters are translated into local parameters, and a set of connection admission control conditions are tested at each switch; <p> This requires clients to specify their traffic characteristics. For this discussion, we use the (X min ; X ave ; I; P ) traffic characterization as suggested in <ref> [9, 6] </ref>, where X min is the minimum packet inter-arrival time, X ave is the average packet inter-arrival time over an averaging interval, I is the length of the interval, and P is the maximum packet size. <p> Usually, there are multiple priority levels that the new connection can be placed into. Different connection establishment schemes can be used to choose the priority level for the new connection. One scheme for establishing a real-time connection is described in <ref> [9] </ref>, in which a new connection is setup with a one-round-trip message: during the forward trip of the establishment message, the new connection is assigned the smallest possible delay bound at each switch to maximize the probability that the new connection's end-to-end delay bound can be met; during the return trip, <p> The sorted priority queue provides maximum flexibility in allocating delays: there is a continuous spectrum of priorities that can be offered to connections; however, it may be difficult to implement sorted priority queues at high speed; also, a complicated schedulability test is required at connection establishment time <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> We need to quantify this improvement by either analysis or simulation. * Another issue is how to enhance the utilization of the network by offering statistical guarantees in RCSP. Solutions have been proposed for Delay-EDD <ref> [9] </ref> and Stop-and-Go [11] to overbook resources by exploiting the traffic burstiness. We are currently extending those ideas to RCSP.

Reference-contexts: between input links and output links at each switch in order to achieve delay-jitter control; HRR does not have this ability, and thus can not bound delay-jitter in its current form; however, it is possible to modify HRR to implement Stop-and-Go queueing by framing and synchronizing input and output links <ref> [13] </ref>. For a service discipline with a rate controller, like Jitter-EDD and RCSP, a calendar queue mechanism can be used to implement both the rate-jitter controlling and the delay-jitter controlling regulators.

Reference-contexts: Controlling the rate jitter at each switch along the path will only partially reconstruct the traffic pattern; the partially reconstructed traffic pattern obeys the same traf fic specification as the input traffic, but some inter-packet spacing information is lost <ref> [17] </ref>.
