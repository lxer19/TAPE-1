Title: Stability Diagrams for Landau Damping  
Author: J. Scott Berg and Francesco Ruggiero 
Affiliation: European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN)  
Abstract: Coherent modes which are present when there is no incoherent tune spread may be absent when such a spread exists. Such modes are Landau damped. There is instead an incoherent spectrum, a continuum of an infinite number of frequencies, which will decohere (filament), thus not leading to collective instabilities. A stability diagram indicates when Landau damping will be effective. It divides the effective impedance plane, or equivalently the plane of coherent frequency in the absence of tune spread, into regions. The region which contains +i1 corresponds to instability. Thus, one can substitute a simpler computation (finding discrete eigenvalues) for a more complex computation (solving an eigenvalue system with both a discrete and a continuous eigenvalue spectrum). We present stability diagrams assuming a linear tune shift with amplitude, allowing tune spread in two transverse planes or in the longitudinal plane alone. When there is longitudinal tune spread, this can not be done exactly, and we describe approximations which make the computation tractable.

These computations require one to ignore azimuthal mode coupling; however, they do demonstrate how to determine the effects of tune spread on mode coupling under some conditions.

Reference-contexts: Then the following integrals, closely related to the beam transfer function, appear when performing a perturbation analysis to obtain the coherent modes (see, for example, <ref> [3] </ref>): J y @ 0 =@J y d 3 J (1) J z 0 (J ) d 3 J (2) Z jmj m! z (J z ) where m is the longitudinal azimuthal mode number.

Reference-contexts: (8) and (9) respectively are e z 1 E 1 (z 1 ) and zF (1; 1; ; z), where E 1 is the exponential integral, and F is a hypergeometric function (which for 2 an integer, is expressible in terms of elementary functions in this case and subsequent cases) <ref> [4] </ref>. both planes can give substantial improvement over the case where only one plane is considered.
