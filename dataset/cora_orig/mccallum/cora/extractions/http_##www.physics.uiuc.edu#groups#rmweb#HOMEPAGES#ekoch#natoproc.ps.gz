Reference-contexts: Model Hamiltonian Solid C 60 is characterized by a very weak inter-molecular interaction. Therefore the discrete molecular levels merely broaden into narrow, well separated bands (see Fig. 1) <ref> [1] </ref>. The valence band originates from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, which is a 3-fold degenerate t 1u orbital. Doping the solid with alkali metals does not affect the band structure close to the Fermi level very much. <p> Writing Green's function G = (E H) 1 in the same way, we can FIXED-NODE DMC FOR FERMIONS ON A LATTICE 3 the local density approximation <ref> [1] </ref> and (b) using a tight-binding Hamiltonian with only t 1u orbitals [4]. calculate the projection of G onto H 0 [3]: G 00 = E [H 00 + V 01 (E H 11 ) 1 V 10 ] H eff (E) : (2) We see that the physics of the <p> VMC E loc (R VMC ) R VMC 1 P T (R) R 2 = E T : (8) The transition probabilities can be determined from detailed balance 2 T (R 0 ) p (R 0 ! R) (9) which gives p (R ! R 0 ) = 1=N min <ref> [1; 2 T (R 0 )= 2 T (R)] </ref>, with N being the maximum number of possible transitions. It is sufficient to consider only 6 ERIK KOCH ET AL. transitions between configurations that are connected by the Hamiltonian, i.e. transitions in which one electron hops to a neighboring site. <p> The standard prescription is then to propose a transition R ! R 0 with probability 1=N and accept it with probability min <ref> [1; 2 T (R 0 )= 2 T (R)] </ref>. This works well for U not too large. <p> Here A stands for an alkali metal like K, Rb, or Cs. The criterion for the metal-insulator transition is the opening of the gap Density functional calculations predict that the doped Fullerides A n C 60 with n = 1 : : : 5 are metals <ref> [1] </ref>. Only A 6 C 60 is an insulator with a completely filled t 1u band.

Reference-contexts: In fact we can neglect the other bands altogether and get the hopping matrix elements t in; jn 0 between the t 1u orbitals n and n 0 on molecules i and j directly from a tight-binding parameterization <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Figure 2 shows the comparison of the ab initio t 1u band structure with the band structure obtained from the tight-binding Hamiltonian with only t 1u orbitals. <p> For U = 1:3 eV , we find a gap E g 0:6 eV for the Fulleride with bct structure, while the frustrated fcc compound is still metallic E g = 0. This difference is entirely due to the lattice structure. Using realistic parameters for K 4 C 60 <ref> [5] </ref> that crystallizes in a bct structure we find a Mott insulator with gap E g 0:7 eV , which is in line with experimental findings: E g = 0:5 0:1 eV [19].

Reference-contexts: The on-site Coulomb interaction U can be calculated within density functional theory <ref> [6] </ref>. It is given by the increase in the energy of the t 1u level per electron that is added to one molecule of the system. It is important to avoid double counting in the calculation of U .

Reference-contexts: While the relaxation of the occupied orbitals and the polarization of neighboring molecules has to be included in the calculation, excitations within the t 1u band must be excluded, since they are contained explicitly in the Hamiltonian (3).

K 3 C 60 In a first step we investigate what consequences the degeneracy of the t 1u -band has for the Mott transition in K 3 C 60 . The analysis is motivated by the following simple argument [14, 15].

Reference-contexts: A good compromise between these two extremes is to start from the non-interacting wavefunction but reduce the weight of configurations R with large double occupancies D (R). This leads (up to normalization) to the Gutzwiller wavefunction <ref> [9] </ref>: T (R) = g D (R) (R); (5) FIXED-NODE DMC FOR FERMIONS ON A LATTICE 5 Gutzwiller wavefunctions T (R) = g D (R) (R).

Reference-contexts: For larger problems we use variational Monte Carlo <ref> [10] </ref>. The idea is to perform a random walk in the space of configurations, with transition probabilities p (R ! R 0 ) chosen such that the configurations R V MC in the random walk have the probability distribution function 2 T (R).

Reference-contexts: It is, however, difficult to compare the energies from these calculations since each VMC result comes with its own statistical errors. This problem can be avoided with correlated sampling <ref> [11] </ref>. The idea is to use the same random walk for FIXED-NODE DMC FOR FERMIONS ON A LATTICE 7 Gutzwiller parameter g. The calculations are for a Hubbard model with 8 fi 8 sites, 28 + 28 electrons, and U = 4 t.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, for small U the paramagnetic state is favorable, while for large U the antiferromagnetic state gives a lower variational energy. We notice that for all values of U the optimal U 0 is much smaller than U . 3.2. FIXED-NODE DIFFUSION MONTE CARLO Diffusion Monte Carlo <ref> [12] </ref> allows us, in principle, to sample the true ground state of a Hamiltonian. The basic idea is to use a projection operator that has the lowest eigenstate as a fixed point.

Reference-contexts: K 3 C 60 In a first step we investigate what consequences the degeneracy of the t 1u -band has for the Mott transition in K 3 C 60 . The analysis is motivated by the following simple argument <ref> [14, 15] </ref>. In the limit of very large U we can estimate the energies needed to calculate the gap (19). For half filling, all molecules will have 3 electrons in the t 1u orbital (Fig. 7, top). 12 ERIK KOCH ET AL. <p> Nevertheless the argument suggests that orbital degeneracy might play an important role for the Mott transition. To test this proposition, we have performed quantum Monte Carlo calculations for the model Hamiltonian (3) with hopping matrix elements appropriate for K 3 C 60 <ref> [14] </ref>. The Coulomb interaction U has been varied from U = 0 : : : 1:75 eV to study the opening of the gap. Since the Monte Carlo calculations are for finite systems, we have to extrapolate to infinite system size.

Reference: 16. <editor> We note that this does not happen for the hopping of an extra charge against a ferromagnetic background. </editor> <title> For a non-degenerate, bipartite system the ferromagnetic arrangement is actually favorable (Nagaoka's theorem, Y. </title> <journal> Nagaoka (1966) Phys. Rev. </journal> <volume> B 147, </volume> <month> 392), </month> <title> but for a system with orbital degeneracy N an antiferromagnetic background seems in general more favorable, since hopping can then take place in N channels. </title>
Reference-contexts: Also the analogy of the hopping in the many-body case with the hopping of a single electron is not rigorous, since the hopping of an extra charge against an antiferromagnetic background creates a string of flipped spins <ref> [16] </ref>. Nevertheless the argument suggests that orbital degeneracy might play an important role for the Mott transition. To test this proposition, we have performed quantum Monte Carlo calculations for the model Hamiltonian (3) with hopping matrix elements appropriate for K 3 C 60 [14].

Reference-contexts: This difference is entirely due to the lattice structure. Using realistic parameters for K 4 C 60 [5] that crystallizes in a bct structure we find a Mott insulator with gap E g 0:7 eV , which is in line with experimental findings: E g = 0:5 0:1 eV <ref> [19] </ref>. Conclusion We have seen that, due to more efficient hopping, orbital degeneracy increases the critical U at which the Mott transition takes place. This puts the integer-doped Fullerides close to a Mott transition.
