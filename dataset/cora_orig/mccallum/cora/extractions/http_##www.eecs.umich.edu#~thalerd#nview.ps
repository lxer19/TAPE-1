Title: NView: A Visual Framework for Network Tool Integration

Abstract: Monitoring and managing distributed applications and networks present a number of problems. Tracking down the source of connection problems over a large area, such as the Internet, can be time-consuming and confusing, as one must deal with many small utilities. In this paper, we present NView, a framework program for integrating network tools into a uniform visual interface with a minimum of effort. We also discuss an example implementation which has been applied to the Internet's Multicast Backbone. This easily customized tool allows various "what if" questions to be asked, and results to be displayed in different ways. NView can be used both off-line as a design tool, and on-line as a network monitoring tool.

Reference-contexts: Among the relevant ones are Unix utilities, TCP/IP management protocols such as SNMP, and other network managers. Such tools are individually useful, but they must be used in conjunction with each other to achieve optimum benefit. Unix utilities such as ping and traceroute <ref> [6] </ref> are text-based and deal only with the lower layers of the network. They are relevant to our first problem of describing the network topology and status.

Reference-contexts: This is currently unacceptable, although it can be very advantageous when nodes do support SNMP. Lastly, a number of commercial network management tools exist with which we may draw comparisons. We will briefly look at two examples. IBM's AIX NetView/6000 <ref> [7] </ref> does provide SNMP capability and on-line monitoring with a visual interface. It employs a two-level structure, where subtrees of nodes extend from a single, top-level "backbone" of networks. It also allows custom features and applications for performance monitoring.

Reference-contexts: It employs a two-level structure, where subtrees of nodes extend from a single, top-level "backbone" of networks. It also allows custom features and applications for performance monitoring. However, it requires SNMP capabilities on all nodes, runs only under AIX, and requires manual placement of nodes on displays. IBM's INTREPID <ref> [8] </ref> also provides a visual framework, but is intended for network topology design. It also utilizes a two-level structure of nodes similar to that of NetView/6000. INTREPID allows the entire network to be redesigned for optimal topology and permits manual design modifications.

Reference-contexts: Each of these will be covered in turn. 4.1 Network Decomposition and Representa tion Various techniques exist for laying out graphs in an understandable manner, such as the Spring Embedder algorithm described by Fruchterman and Reingold <ref> [9] </ref>. Typical goals are to distribute vertices evenly around the graph, minimize edge crossings, and make edge lengths uniform. In achieving these goals, there is an obvious trade-off between aesthetics and speed.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the times when the server is likely to be most useful are when the network is partitioned. At such times, the server may be unreachable or have incomplete information. A centralized server model is clearly inadequate. An off-line debugging tool, mrdebug <ref> [12] </ref>, by Deborah Agarwal, uses an map-mbone-style file to allow the user to model the effects of proposed topological changes on source broadcast trees and source-to-destination paths.

Reference-contexts: Together, this provides a convenient tool for both network debugging and design. As SNMP becomes more prevalent, the importance of SNMP compatibility will increase. A proposal is now underway to support multicast information in SNMP for physical routers that can do multicasting <ref> [13] </ref>, such as the PIM routers. It is expected that our tool will become even more powerful when that happens. NView is also useful in a far broader context than our example, the MBone.
