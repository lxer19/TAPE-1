Reference-contexts: These are traversed by "clicking" in textual or iconic active areas, or searched via query mechanisms <ref> [1] </ref>. Hypertext links may point to a different location in the same document or to another document which may be located perhaps in another continent! Documents are not limited to containing only textual information and may include high resolution images, audio and video samples.

Reference-contexts: This is the potential of the Internet-based World Wide Web (WWW or W3) project ... <ref> [2] </ref> The World Wide Web merges hypermedia techniques with networked document retrieval to provide a global information system of linked documents.

Reference-contexts: Such browser and server programs are freely available for most popular computer configurations. With the explosive growth of the World Wide Web (500-fold since the first graphical browsers were made available this year <ref> [3] </ref>), and a potential audience of 15 million in more than 50 countries, providing information via the WWW is becoming an extremely attractive proposition. 2 L a T E X to HTML Conversion: Why? HTML is quite a simple markup language to learn and use.
