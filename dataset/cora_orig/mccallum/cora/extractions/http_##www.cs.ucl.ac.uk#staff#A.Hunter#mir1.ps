Title: Making inconsistency respectable 1: A logical framework for inconsistency in reasoning  
Author: Dov Gabbay and Anthony Hunter 
Address: London SW7 2BZ, UK  
Affiliation: Department of Computing Imperial College  
Abstract: We claim there is a fundamental difference between the way humans handle inconsistency and the way it is currently handled in formal logical systems: To a human, resolving inconsistencies is not necessarily done by "restoring" consistency but by supplying rules telling one how to act when the inconsistency arises. For artificial intelligence there is an urgent need to revise the view that inconsistency is a "bad" thing, and instead view it as mostly a "good" thing. Inconsistencies can be read as signals to take external action, such as "ask the user", or invoke a "truth maintenance system", or as signals for internal actions that activate some rules and deactivate other rules. There is a need to develop a framework in which inconsistency can be viewed according to context, as a vital trigger for actions, for learning, and as an important source of direction in argumentation. 1 Our position

Reference-contexts: Thus the query ?f ly (a) will get no answer. There are some other approaches which use multiple truth values, such as the values fT; F; N; Bg, where T denotes "true", F denotes "false", N denotes "neither" true nor false, and B denotes "both" true and false <ref> [Bel77] </ref>. For the example, f ly (a) would be assigned B. Such as assignment captures the situation of both fly (a) and :f ly (a) following from the database. Our framework generalizes on all of the above solutions, both technically and conceptually.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we have outlined a serie sof actions. We now require a clearer logic formalization coupling inconsistency with action or meta-action. We propsoe that reasoning with inconsistency can be studied as a Labelled Deductive System <ref> [Gab89] </ref> where deduction is done both on labels and on formulae. The framework of Labelled Deductive Systems (LDS) is that a basic unit of information is a labelled formula, and that a logic can then be defined in terms of allowed operations on the labelled formulae.

Reference-contexts: The following is an example (based on an example from <ref> [Nut88] </ref>. Professor Nobody had purchased a tropical fish from the pet shop, together with a guide on tropical fish. The book stated that if the fish is an etropline, it comes from sea-water, and if the fish is cichlid, it comes from fresh-water. <p> For example, in this case the rules are ordered according to "specificity". The rule t 2 has a more specific antecedent than t 1 . In a logic such as LDR <ref> [Nut88] </ref>, this ordering allows for a resolution of the conflict by prefering the conclusion from the more specific rule. However, a defeasible system cannot always resolve inconsistency.

Reference-contexts: Relevance logic will notice that the contradiction involves another part of the database, namely the part dealing with "a" and will not infer the goal. A paraconsistent logic will allow the inference of both consequents, though some such as IDL <ref> [PB91] </ref> will annotate the consequents to show they are defeasible. A truth maintenance system will recognize the inconsistency, and possibly take out some of the data and arrive at a new consistent database.
