Abstract: This list describes the known bugs in the first printing of the first edition of Introduction to Algorithms. These bugs were fixed in the second printing. An errata sheet for the second and subsequent printings is available separately. Typically, page and line numbers are given to localize the error. A negative line number indicates numbering from the bottom up. The finder of each bug is credited on the right margin. Actual text from the book is surrounded by A PostScript version of this errata sheet is available via an Internet electronic mail server. To receive instructions on how to use this service, send electronic mail to algorithms@theory.lcs.mit.edu with "Subject: help" in the message header. The instructions also describe how to submit bug reports by email and how to obtain errata for the second printing. We regret that we cannot personally respond to all mail.
