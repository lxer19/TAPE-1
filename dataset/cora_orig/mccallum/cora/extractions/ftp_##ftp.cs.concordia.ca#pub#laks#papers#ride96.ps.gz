Abstract: World Wide Web is a hypertext based, distributed information system that provides access to vast amounts of information in the internet. A fundamental problem with the Web is the difficulty of retrieving specific information of interest to the user, from the enormous number of resources that are available. In this paper, we develop a simple logic called WebLog that is capable of retrieving information from HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) documents in the Web. WebLog is inspired by SchemaLog, a logic for multi-database interoperability. We demonstrate the suitability of WebLog for (a) querying and restructuring Web information, (b) exploiting partial knowledge users might have on the information being queried, and (c) dealing with the dynamic nature of information in the Web. We illustrate the simplicity and power of WebLog using a variety of applications involving real-life information in the Web.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [1] </ref>, Abiteboul, Cluet, and Milo make use of the grammar of a document to `map' it to an appropriate object-oriented database. <p> They investigate optimization techniques suitable for this "reverse translation". Shortcomings of these proposals from a Web querying standpoint were identified in Section 1. On the other hand, we anticipate a natural use for techniques in these works in WebLog applications. We can use the techniques of <ref> [1] </ref> to "materialize" relevant information into databases - OO or otherwise which can then be queried using WebLog. We plan to investigate this issue in future. Recent months have seen a spate of work in the area of querying the Web.

Reference-contexts: A detailed discussion is clearly beyond the scope of this paper. Interested readers are referred to <ref> [3] </ref>. HTML is the language used for creating hypertext documents on the Web. It has the facility for creating documents that contain hyperlinks which are pointers from keywords appearing in the document to a destination. At its simplest, the destination is another HTML document.

Reference-contexts: In spirit, this is similar to the molecules in F-logic <ref> [7] </ref>, and more recently in Schema-Log [10]. Example: http : ==www:com [X : title!`W eb 0 ; hlink!!L; occurs!!`example 0 ] is an atomic formula in WebLog.

Reference-contexts: The search interface provides fast access to information in the catalog. In Section 5, we discuss in detail two popular search tools - WWWW, and Lycos. More information on Web search tools in general can be found in <ref> [16, 8] </ref>. Currently available Web search tools suffer from the following drawbacks. * Partial knowledge that a user might have on the information she is querying about is not fully exploited. As an example, consider the user searching for call for papers (CFPs) of all database conferences.

Reference-contexts: The framework we propose is general enough to handle multimedia documents in the Web. It is inspired by SchemaLog, a simple but powerful logic language proposed by Lakshmanan, Sadri, and Subrama-nian <ref> [9, 10] </ref> for interoperability in multidatabase systems. Indeed, the syntax of the language is almost identical to that of SchemaLog. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we provide an overview of HTML. The conceptual model of HTML documents is presented in Section 3. <p> Restructuring and ad hoc querying are unique advantages of WebLog. 6 Conclusions The objective of this work has been to provide a declarative system for Web querying and restructuring. With this in mind, we have developed a simple logic called WebLog, inspired by the multidatabase interoperability language, SchemaLog <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. We presented a conceptual model for HTML documents and studied its syntax and (informal) semantics. One of the novelties of WebLog is that it provides a first class treatment of hyperlinks in HTML documents, and makes use of this to express powerful forms of navigation across HTML documents.

Web visualization is the emphasis of Hy+. Salient features of our framework include the following. The declarative query interface of WebLog facilitates simple and natural ways of querying Web information.
