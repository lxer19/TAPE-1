Reference-contexts: Graphical UI. IBM's currently available Workgroup Agent product 1 contains an interesting graphical UI approach, more advanced than that in Globenet. 3. Support for specification via natural language (i.e., a goodly fragment). 4.2 Itinerant Agents and Inter-Agent Communication Itinerant Agent framework (Agent Meeting Places) <ref> [ Chess et al., 1995 ] </ref> is a third project, currently in early prototype, which also uses RAISE. By itinerant, we mean that an agent moves its execution locus between network nodes.

Reference-contexts: Learning is then the incorporation of the TELL's content into the recipient's knowledge base within the black box. This view of learning agent is discussed, for example, in our previous work on non-monotonic updating [ Grosof, 1992b ] . A similar view of this is as "belief revision" cf. <ref> [ Gardenfors, 1988 ] </ref> [ Nebel, 1989 ] . A large body of work on non-monotonic reasoning can be viewed as treating the fundamental knowledge representation theory of a single agent learning from advice provided by a single instructor.

Reference-contexts: This is especially helpful when there is significant reasoning with the knowledge, when knowledge and inferencing about the bases for resolving conflicts is itself interestingly contentful. There are many other relevant issues we did not address here: e.g., operationalization <ref> [ Gordon and Subramanian, 1993 ] </ref> , tight integration with probabilistic-flavor knowledge and techniques, and tight integration with induction, especially from direct experience and large amounts of exemplars. 8.5 Applicability of Approach to Multiple Non Monotonic Formalisms Part of this paper's contribution is to elaborate upon our approach (to conflict resolution

Reference-contexts: RAISE is currently in prototype. Its first phase includes rule-based inferenc-ing and procedural attachments, plus facilities for authoring (instruction) and communication. Globenet <ref> [ Grosof and Foulger, 1995 ] </ref> is a pilot application of RAISE. Globenet is a system for retrieval and handling of newsgroup information, oriented initially to customer service support. At Globenet's heart are intelligent agents that lay (non-programmer) users instruct with rules.

Reference-contexts: For example, the first non-monotonic formalism to do so was circumscription [ McCarthy, 1980 ] [ McCarthy, 1986 ] , which has the formal concept of prioritization [ Lifschitz, 1985 ] <ref> [ Grosof, 1991 ] </ref> . Prioritization involves a strict partial order of precedence between defaults. Prioritization is inspired by the spirit of lexicographic orderings, e.g., alphabetic orderings. Each premise default can be viewed as the preference to believe the default's associated conclusion.

Reference-contexts: We developed the theoretical aspects of the formalism, including a sketch of inferencing algorithms [ Grosof, 1993a ] .

This capability of our approach is discussed, for example, in <ref> [ Grosof, 1992a ] </ref> . 8.3 Probabilistic-Flavored Approaches One alternative approach to advice taking is to base beliefs on (and resolve conflicts based on) statistical or weighting schemes, after lots of example facts have been accumulated, either from advice or direct experience.

In particular, they suffice 15 to mechanize the lighting repair example. <p> PD is a meta-language, It is capable of being interpreted in (i.e., mapped into) potentially several different non-monotonic formalisms. There are many different formalisms for defaults, and quite a few are equipped with prioritization-flavored precedence. (See <ref> [ Grosof, 1992b ] </ref> and [ Grosof, 1995b ] for a review.) However, we are aware of only two that are capable of reasoning about the precedence, e.g., on basis of relative authority. The first one to enable such was DAP circumscription, which we developed for this kind of capability. <p> Learning is then the incorporation of the TELL's content into the recipient's knowledge base within the black box.

[ Grosof, 1993b ] <ref> [ Grosof, 1993a ] </ref> There, we employed a variant of circumscription as the non-monotonic logical formalism.

Reference-contexts: In such situations of very small "samples", most inductive learning methods, which are typically statistical in flavor, do not have much help (or confidence) to offer. The work of [ Maes, 1994 ] <ref> [ Lashkari et al., 1994 ] </ref> is an interesting approach, viewable as advice-taking, which exploits a community of agents via communicating example sets.

Reference-contexts: A relatively simple knowledge representation approach to resolving conflict between defaults generally, is to employ a qualitative precedence ordering between the defaults. For example, the first non-monotonic formalism to do so was circumscription [ McCarthy, 1980 ] [ McCarthy, 1986 ] , which has the formal concept of prioritization <ref> [ Lifschitz, 1985 ] </ref> [ Grosof, 1991 ] . Prioritization involves a strict partial order of precedence between defaults. Prioritization is inspired by the spirit of lexicographic orderings, e.g., alphabetic orderings. Each premise default can be viewed as the preference to believe the default's associated conclusion.

Reference-contexts: In addition, there is more recently some work on multi-agent non-monotonic reasoning that provides some theoretical basis for advice-taking from multiple conflicting sources, but more distantly than our work. E.g., <ref> [ Morgenstern, 1990 ] </ref> treats agents reasoning non-monotonically about the beliefs of other agents that themselves reason non-monotonically. Finally, there is a whole body of work on integrating yes/no and probabilistic and non-monotonic reasoning, e.g., [ Grosof, 1988 ] [ Bacchus, 1990 ] . Summary of Paper: See the Abstract.

Reference-contexts: This view of learning agent is discussed, for example, in our previous work on non-monotonic updating [ Grosof, 1992b ] . A similar view of this is as "belief revision" cf. [ Gardenfors, 1988 ] <ref> [ Nebel, 1989 ] </ref> . A large body of work on non-monotonic reasoning can be viewed as treating the fundamental knowledge representation theory of a single agent learning from advice provided by a single instructor.

Reference-contexts: This kind of implicit presumption of specficity precedence has been studied extensively in the non-monotonic reasoning community, e.g., <ref> [ Touretzky, 1986 ] </ref> . In developing rule bases, this potential for conflict partly arises after knowledge is encoded, due to inference and representation mechanisms that involve logical non-monotonicity, e.g., the use of negation-as-failure and inheritance with exceptions.
