Abstract: We describe efficient constructions of small probability spaces that approximate the joint distribution of general random variables. Previous work on efficient constructions concentrate on approximations of the joint distribution for the special case of identical, uniformly distributed random variables.

Reference-contexts: A typical example of the use of this methodology has been provided by Luby in his work on the maximal independent set problem <ref> [15] </ref>.
