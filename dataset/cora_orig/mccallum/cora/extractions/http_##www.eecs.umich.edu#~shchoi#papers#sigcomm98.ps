Abstract: How to control hand-off drops is a very important Quality-of-Service (QoS) issue in cellular networks. In order to keep the hand-off dropping probability below a pre-specified target value (thus providing a probabilistic QoS guarantee), we design and evaluate predictive and adaptive schemes for the bandwidth reservation for the existing connections' hand-offs and the admission control of new connections. We first develop a method to estimate user mobility based on an aggregate history of hand-offs observed in each cell. This method is then used to predict (probabilistically) mobiles' directions and hand-off times in a cell. For each cell, the bandwidth to be reserved for hand-offs is calculated by estimating the total sum of fractional bandwidths of the expected hand-offs within a mobility-estimation time window. We also develop an algorithm that controls this window for efficient use of bandwidth and effective response to (1) time-varying traffic/mobility and (2) inaccuracy of mobility estimation. Three different admission-control schemes for new connection requests using this bandwidth reservation are proposed. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes to show that they meet our design goal and outperform the static reservation scheme under various scenarios.

Reference-contexts: In this way, our scheme can be integrated with any adaptive QoS scheme. The notion of bandwidth reservation for hand-offs was introduced in the mid-80s <ref> [5] </ref>. With this scheme, a portion of the link capacity is permanently reserved for hand-offs. This reserved bandwidth is not allowed to be used for new connections so that P HD may be kept lower than P CB . We will henceforth call this a static reservation scheme.

Reference-contexts: To reduce hand-off drops, researchers have also proposed adaptive QoS schemes in which a connection's QoS can be downgraded when there is an insufficient bandwidth avail 155 (a) Star topology case (b) Fully-connected case able in the new cell <ref> [6, 8] </ref>. 1 In fact, QoS adaptation can be implemented independently of bandwidth reservation, and when both are used together, bandwidth reservation is made on the basis of the minimum QoS of each connection. In this way, our scheme can be integrated with any adaptive QoS scheme. <p> This hand-off time estimation makes it possible for BSs to reserve bandwidth more efficiently. There have also been research efforts for adaptive bandwidth reservation. The author of <ref> [6] </ref> suggested bandwidth reservation depending on the existing connections in adjacent cells. However, the scheme lacks such details as how much of bandwidth should be reserved.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, it is not clear whether the scheme will still work when this assumption does not hold; and (2) there is no specified mechanism to predict which cells mobiles will move to. The shadow cluster concept was suggested in <ref> [7] </ref> to estimate future resource requirements and perform admission control in order to limit the hand-off dropping probability, in which the shadow cluster is a set of cells around an active mobile.

In this way, our scheme can be integrated with any adaptive QoS scheme. <p> In a typical outdoor cellular network, there will be both pedestrian and vehicular mobiles while in the indoor case, there are mostly pedestrians or non-moving objects. Another possibility is to use mobile-specific histories as suggested in <ref> [8] </ref>. That is, each specific mobile's movement is observed over time, then the mobile's direction in a specific cell can be predicted by utilizing this observation. <p> The probability samples represent the average probability during the corresponding one-hour period, i.e., P CB at t = 8:5 represents the average over the interval <ref> [8; 9] </ref>. First, we observe that outside the peak hour regions, both P CB and P HD are negligibly small. During the peak hours, P HD is almost the same for different schemes, and bounded by P HD;target (= 0:01). <p> Their scheme was shown to be better than the static reservation scheme. The authors of <ref> [8] </ref> extended this scheme as a part of their proposal to accommodate heterogeneous connection bandwidths, and studied the effects of design parameters used in the scheme. The main problems of these schemes are: (1) they assumed the sojourn time of each mobile is exponentially-distributed, which is impractical. <p> is robust to the inaccuracy of mobility estimation and the time-variation of traffic/mobility, thanks to our mobility estimation time window control; and (3) due to the adaptability of our scheme, it is not required to determine the optimal value of parameters, which might depend on the traffic status, as in <ref> [8] </ref>. There were also limited efforts to estimate mobility. The authors of [8] explored mobility estimation for an indoor wireless system based on both mobile-specific and cell-specific observation histories. Mobile-specific observation of mobility is costly and not accurate in general. <p> traffic/mobility, thanks to our mobility estimation time window control; and (3) due to the adaptability of our scheme, it is not required to determine the optimal value of parameters, which might depend on the traffic status, as in <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This uneven traffic load can affect the performance evaluation of our proposed schemes, hence making it difficult to comprehend their operations correctly. So, we connected two border cells, i.e., cells &lt;1&gt; to &lt;10&gt;, artificially so that the whole cellular system forms a ring architecture as was assumed in <ref> [10] </ref> (unless stated otherwise). The parameters used include: P HD;target = 0:01, T start = 1 (second), N quad = 100, T int = 1 (hour), N win days = 1, and w 0 = w 1 = 1. <p> So, AC3 is the most favorable among the schemes considered. 6 Related Work We are not the first to attempt to design bandwidth-reservation and admission-control schemes to keep the connection hand-off dropping probability below a target value. The authors of <ref> [10] </ref> advocated the connection hand-off dropping probability as an important connection-level QoS parameter in wireless/mobile networks, and designed a distributed call admission-control scheme to keep the connection hand-off dropping probability below a specified limit. <p> We will integrate our work with routing and re-routing in the wired networks by considering bandwidth reservation in the wired links along the routes of hand-off connections. Computational complexity of our scheme is reported in [4] as a part of the comparison study with other existing schemes in <ref> [10, 14] </ref>. In that paper, the three schemes are compared quantitatively through extensive simulations in terms of: (1) performance measures P CB , P HD , and B u ; (2) dependency on the design parameters; (3) dependency on the mobility estimation accuracy; and (4) complexity.

Reference-contexts: Here, we preclude (1) delay-insensitive applications, which might tolerate long hand-off delays in case of insufficient bandwidth in the new cell at the time of hand-off; and (2) soft hand-off of the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems <ref> [15] </ref>, in which a mobile can communicate via two adjacent BSs simultaneously for a while before the actual hand-off takes place. We propose to set aside some bandwidth in each cell for possible hand-offs from its adjacent cells.
