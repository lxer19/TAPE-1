Title: EXACT AND INEXACT PENALTY METHODS FOR THE GENERALIZED BILEVEL PROGRAMMING PROBLEM  
Author: P. MARCOTTE and D.L. ZHU 
Keyword: Optimization Variational Inequalities Bilevel Programming Exact Penalty Descent Methods  
Date: June 1993 revised September 1995  
Abstract: We consider a hierarchical system where a leader incorporates into its strategy the reaction of the follower to its decision. The follower's reaction is quite generally represented as the solution set to a monotone variational inequality. For the solution of this nonconvex mathematical program a penalty approach is proposed, based on the formulation of the lower level variational inequality as a mathematical program. Under natural regularity conditions, we prove the exactness of a certain penalty function, and give strong necessary optimality conditions for a class of generalized bilevel programs.

Reference-contexts: This difficult, nonconvex problem has drawn the attention of the mathematical community, both from the theoretical and computational points of view. (See the special issues of the journals Computers and Operations Research [5] and Annals of Operations Research <ref> [1] </ref> devoted to this topic.) The present paper studies the properties of a class of penalty functions, both exact and inexact, for the GBLP. The idea is not new. <p> Consider the bilevel problem min x 2 y subject to h2y; y zi 0 for all z 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>: (16) Clearly the point (0; 0) is the unique solution of the above GBLP.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, a direct proof of exactness of the gap function, in the linear case, can be found in Anandalingam and White <ref> [2] </ref>. This result can actually be extended to the situation where f is nonlinear and F assumes the form F (x; y) = H (x) + h.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, Haslinger and Neittaanmaki proposed (see [13], chapter 10) to penalize the state constraints associated with the lower level of their optimal shape design problem. Other schemes have also been proposed in the realm of linear bilevel programming (see Bard <ref> [3] </ref>). In this paper, we formulate the lower level variational inequality as a parameterized equation related to the duality gap of the lower level problem. We then use this "gap" function as a penalty term for the upper level problem. <p> Several authors have previously proposed optimality conditions based on the reformulation of a bilevel program as an optimization program constrained by the optimality conditions, in one form or another, of the lower level program. (See Bard <ref> [3] </ref> or Bi, Calamai and Conn [4].) The drawback of these approaches is that, in general, no constraint qualification holds for the KKT constraints, leading to optimality conditions that are very seldom realized in practice.

Reference-contexts: Under those assumptions, the GBLP is well defined, possesses at least one solution, and the solution set to the lower level variational inequality is, for fixed x in X, a compact, convex set. We will also make use of the following definitions. Definition 1 (Dussault and Marcotte <ref> [7] </ref>) Let F be a continuous, monotone function from a convex polyhedron X ae R n into R n and denote by VIP (X; F ) the variational inequality problem associated with X and F , i.e: Find x fl in X such that VIP (F; X) : hF (x fl <p> Assume there exists a sequence fx l g converging to x 0 and a sequence of extreme points u l 2 Y such that u l 2 T (x l ) but u l =2 T (x 0 ). It follows from the geometric regularity assumption (see also <ref> [7] </ref>) that hF (x l ; y (x l )); u l y (x l )i = 0: (25) Now we select a subsequence fu l g l2L such that lim l2L u l = u 1 1 , with u 1 2 Y T (x 0 ).

Reference-contexts: Since the gap function characterizing the lower level is nonnegative over the feasible domain, the penalty term assumes a very 2 simple, linear form. In the separable case, our formulation coincides with that found in a frequently overlooked paper of Fisk <ref> [8] </ref>, who also penalizes the "standard" gap function. However, the exactness of this penalty scheme has not be proved by the author.

Reference-contexts: constraints are linearly independent and the strict complementarity condition 0i &gt; 0 () C i (x 0 ; y 0 ) = 0; 8i (40) is satisfied then, in a neighborhood of x 0 , the functions y (x) and (x) are unique and Lipschitz continuous. (See Friesz et al. <ref> [9] </ref> for example.) For given x, denote by T (x) the minimal face of Y (x) containing the solution y (x) to the lower level variational inequality. We have the following results: 13 Proposition 2 Let x 0 2 X.

Reference-contexts: A global optimum can only be achieved by resorting to global optimization techniques such as implicit enumeration, cutting plane methods, etc. Recently, in the context of linear bilevel programming, Gendreau et al. <ref> [11] </ref> proposed an efficient heuristic for generating a high-quality initial solution, later to be used as a starting point for 19 local search methods. This procedure was based on a primal-dual, exact penalty formulation of the linear bilevel program.

Reference-contexts: We illustrate our main result using a two-dimensional example taken from the paper by Gauvin and Savard <ref> [12] </ref>, where the lower level problem corresponds to an optimization problem. <p> Let us mention that stronger optimality results, based on local sensitivity analysis results, have been proposed by Gauvin and Savard <ref> [12] </ref>. From a practical point of view, the nonconvex and nondifferentiable problems P5 and P8 are difficult to solve. A global optimum can only be achieved by resorting to global optimization techniques such as implicit enumeration, cutting plane methods, etc.

Reference-contexts: In a second stage, this nonlinear system is appended, again via a penalty term, to the upper level objective, to yield an unconstrained global optimization problem. Similarly, Haslinger and Neittaanmaki proposed (see <ref> [13] </ref>, chapter 10) to penalize the state constraints associated with the lower level of their optimal shape design problem. Other schemes have also been proposed in the realm of linear bilevel programming (see Bard [3]).

Reference-contexts: Proof. The sets Y (x) and T (x) are uniformly compact and the point-to-set mapping T is continuous in a neighborhood of x 0 . Also the function y (x) is continuous on X. The conclusion then follows from Theorem 7 in Hogan <ref> [16] </ref>. 2 Now, as in the previous sections, we associate with the GBLP its reformulation P7: min f (x; y) (42) subject to G 0 (x; y) = 0: and the corresponding penalty problem: P8: min q ff (x; y; ) = f (x; y) + G 0 (x; y): (43)

Reference-contexts: This mathematical program was first introduced by Marcotte <ref> [18] </ref> for formulating an equilibrium-constrained network design problem. The term "follower" may denote either one, several or infinitely many "players". <p> The gap function has been used to construct descent methods for solving variational inequalities. We refer in particular to Marcotte <ref> [18] </ref>, and Marcotte and Dussault [19] for the linear gap function (ff = 0), and to Fukushima [10] for the quadratic, differentiable gap function (ff &gt; 0). The function OE is concave in z (strongly concave if ff is positive).

We refer in particular to Marcotte [18], and Marcotte and Dussault <ref> [19] </ref> for the linear gap function (ff = 0), and to Fukushima [10] for the quadratic, differentiable gap function (ff &gt; 0). The function OE is concave in z (strongly concave if ff is positive). <p> Proof. Following a result of Marcotte and Dussault <ref> [19] </ref>, for each x in N 0 , there exists a positive number j (x) such that the bound G 0 (x; y) j (x)ky (x) yk (28) holds, for all y in Y . <p> This results in the formulation: min f (x; y) + (36) subject to hF (x; y); y u e i 8e 2 E; which yields a differentiable formulation. Alternatively, the gap function can be expressed in dual form (see Marcotte and Dussault <ref> [19] </ref>) as 0 subject to F (x; y) + B t = 0: Replacing G 0 (x; y) by its dual formulation yields P6: min f (x; y) + (hF (x; y); yi + b t ) (38) subject to F (x; y) + B t = 0: Corollary 2 Under <p> For fixed x 2 X, one has (see Proposition 3 of <ref> [19] </ref>) G 0 (x; y) j (x)ky (x) yk 8y 2 Y (x); (45) where j (x) depends continuously on the distance ffi (x) of y (x) to the boundary of T (x). Now, Corollary 4 ensures that j (x) is continuous in a neighborhood of x 0 .
