Title: A Control Theoretical Model for Quality of Service Adaptations  
Author: Baochun Li, Klara Nahrstedt 
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  
Abstract: In a distributed environment where multiple applications compete and share a limited amount of system resources, applications tend to suffer from variations in resource availability, and are desired to adapt their behavior to the resource variations of the system. We propose a Task Control Model to rigorously model the dynamics of an adaptive system, using the digital control theory. With our Task Control Model, we are able to quantitatively analyze the stability and equilibrium of the adaptive applications, while simultaneously providing fairness guarantees to other applications in the system. Our control algorithm has also been extended to the cases where no sufficient task state information are observable. We show that even under these circumstances, our Task Control Model can still be applied and our control algorithms yield stable and responsive behavior.

Reference-contexts: The essence of a closed-loop control system is its feedback path. Various software and distributed systems utilize feedback information for adaptation purposes. For example, the work presented in <ref> [2] </ref> uses software feedback mechanisms that enhance system adaptiveness by adjusting video sending rate according to on-the-fly network variations. However, the algorithms used in most of the software systems are heuristic in nature, and the analysis of various adaptation properties such as stability, steady-state fairness and responsiveness is not addressed.

Reference-contexts: For example, if a standard proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control <ref> [5] </ref> 1 is engaged, then u i (k) obeys the equation u i (k) = u i (k 1) + ff [x c (k) x (k)] + fif [x c (k) x (k)] [x c (k 1) x (k 1)]g (7) where ff and fi are configurable scaling factors. <p> Thus, the transfer function F i (z) of the entire system is <ref> [5] </ref>: F i (z) = 1 + D i (z)G i (z) 1 [(ff + fi)z fi] fl i fi 2)z ( fl i (25) We then consider the discrete characteristic equation of the above: z 2 + ( fl i fi 2)z ( fl i According to theorems in the <p> = 1 + D i (z)G i (z) 1 [(ff + fi)z fi] fl i fi 2)z ( fl i (25) We then consider the discrete characteristic equation of the above: z 2 + ( fl i fi 2)z ( fl i According to theorems in the digital control theory <ref> [5] </ref>, in order for the system to be stable, all roots of Equation (26) need to be within the stability boundary, which is the unit circle. In other words, for any root z, we need jzj &lt; 1.

Reference-contexts: This paper addresses the first justification. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we discuss existing work related to QoS adaptation issues. In Section 3, we propose a Task Control Model based on the Task Flow Model <ref> [7] </ref> in order to analyze adaptation behavior using the control theory. In Section 4, we analyze the stability, fairness and responsiveness of a control theoretical approach that we propose for adaptive systems. <p> Tasks are execution units that perform certain actions to deliver a result to other tasks or the end user. (a) A Generic Task Flow Graph (b) Task Flow Graph for a Visual Tracking System With the above definition of tasks, we utilize the Task Flow Model described in <ref> [7] </ref> and extend the model to address the modeling of adaptation behavior. In this model, the Task Flow Graph is a directed acyclic graph which consists of multiple tasks, and illustrates the consumer-producer dependencies among the tasks. <p> First, we established the Task Control Model based on the Task Flow Model presented in <ref> [7] </ref> and rigorously defined the mapping between classic control systems and the Task Control Model. Second, we proposed a PID control algorithm and analyzed fairness properties, asymptotic stability conditions, and responsiveness of the adaptation behavior.
