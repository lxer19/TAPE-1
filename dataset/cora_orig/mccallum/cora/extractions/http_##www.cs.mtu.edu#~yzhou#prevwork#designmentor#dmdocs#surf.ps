Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction All popular computer graphics textbooks have chapters on curves and surfaces <ref> [1, 5, 6, 7] </ref>. Teaching these chapters could be one of the most challenging tasks in a computer graphics course because of the involved mathematics and the difficulty of visualizing the anticipated effects of the theoretical results. <p> The window in the middle is the tracing window. The large square at the center of this window is the domain of the surface (i.e., <ref> [0; 1] </ref>fi [0; 1]). A small disk, the position indicator, is shown in this square indicating a point (u; v) in the domain. As the position indicator moves in the domain, its corresponding point S (u; v) moves on the surface. <p> The window in the middle is the tracing window.
