Abstract: This paper advances the state of the art in the selection of minimal configurations of sensors and actuators for active vibration control with smart structures. The method extends previous transducer selection work by (1) presenting a unified treatment of the selection and placement of large numbers of both sensors and actuators in a smart structure, (2) developing computationally efficient techniques to select the best sensor-actuator pairs for multiple unknown force disturbances exciting the structure, (3) selecting the best sensors and actuators over multiple frequencies , and (4) providing bounds on the performance of the transducer selection algorithms. The approach is based on a novel, multidimensional extension of the Householder QR factorization algorithm applied to the frequency response matrices that define the vibration control problem. The key features of the algorithm are its very low computational complexity, and a computable bound that can be used to predict whether the transducer selection algorithm will yield an optimal configuration before completing the search. Optimal configurations will result from the selection method when the bound is tight, which is the case for many practical vibration control problems. This paper presents the development of the method, as well as its application in active vibration control of a plate.

Reference-contexts: In this particular control implementation, a feedforward neutralization filter, N , is used to "neutralize" the feedback coupling, C, between the actuators and sensors. This technique is called Q-parameterization, which has been used successfully in vibration control problems to simplify control design <ref> (Flamm et al., 1995) </ref>. Thus, AW S is an estimate of the vibrations that reach the control regions directly, denoted by E. <p> The SPICES consortium's solid-plate model <ref> (Flamm et al. 1995) </ref> was considered.

Reference-contexts: This example highlights the tradeoff that exists between choosing an independent set of actuators and choosing a set that minimizes the residual control error. A similar tradeoff occurs in the use of subset selection 9 methods <ref> (Golub et al., 1976) </ref> to solve general rank-deficient least-squares problems. A solution developed for this problem uses a Householder QR with column-pivoting factorization. For the transducer selection problem, the factorization can be used to efficiently find an independent set of actuators and sensors.

Reference-contexts: To achieve this, a subspace distance measure, D s , can be employed to quantify the difference between the original and candidate submatrices. A popular measure in the statistics, numerical analysis, and signal processing literature <ref> (Golub and Van Loan, 1989) </ref> is given as D s (A; A a ) = sin fi (R (A); R (A a )) (11) 8 where R denotes range space, and sin fi is the sine of the largest principal angle between the range subspaces of the transfer function matrices. <p> However, for the vibration control problem, such an approach could lead to large actuator inputs, which would violate the constraints in Eq. (7). To see this, consider the following example <ref> (Golub and Van Loan, 1989) </ref>. Let S; s = I in Eq. (7), where I is the identity matrix. Also, let ! = ! q so that the minimization is completed over a single frequency. <p> A consequence is that nonzero differences will exist between the range spaces of the original and selected submatrices. As a result, a method is required to determine the circumstances under which the differences between the range spaces is small. A useful bound <ref> (Golub and Van Loan, 1989) </ref> can be determined that specifies these circumstances, i.e., sin fi (A; A a ) r+1 k R 1 sin fi (S T ; (S s ) T ) s+1 k R 1 where r+1 and s+1 are the (r + 1)st and (s + 1)st largest

Reference-contexts: Satisfaction of the control objective will therefore depend on the ability of the transducers to estimate and then manipulate these vibrations at the desired control zones. 3.1 Mathematical formulation For the transducer selection problem, the modified control objective using reduced numbers of actuators <ref> (Heck and Naghshineh, 1994) </ref> is given as min ! h X k E A a W s S k 2 2 subject to ! h X k W s S k 2 with the minimization completed over two additional parameters a 2 I mfiN a (N a &lt; m) and s

Reference-contexts: 1 3 7 7 7 ; (14) then choosing the first two actuators (first two columns of A) gives the residual k E A a k 2 2 = 0, but 2 = k W LS k 2 2 = O (1=*), where Q y is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse operator <ref> (Stewart, 1984) </ref>. As * gets smaller, the actuator weights will grow and eventually violate the constraint in Eq. (13). On the other hand, the other two possible subsets of actuators will lead to small weight norms, but with a much worse residual. <p> In most vibration control problems of interest, the rank of the A and S T matrices will not be exactly zero. Rather, because of numerical approximations, the rank can only be specified in terms of a threshold on singular values, called the numerical rank <ref> (Stewart, 1984) </ref>. A consequence is that nonzero differences will exist between the range spaces of the original and selected submatrices. As a result, a method is required to determine the circumstances under which the differences between the range spaces is small.
