Abstract: A new public key cryptosystem is proposed and analyzed. The scheme is quite practical, and is provably secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack under standard intractability assumptions. There appears to be no previous cryptosystem in the literature that enjoys both of these properties simultaneously.

Reference-contexts: It is essential in designing protocols that are secure against active adversaries.

Reference-contexts: Here, it should be infeasible for an adversary to choose an input x, draw a random hash function H, and then find a different input y such that H (x) = H (y). Such hash function families are also called target collision 7 resistant. See <ref> [5] </ref> for recent results and further discussion. 3 The Basic Scheme We assume that we have a group G of prime order q, where q is large. We also assume that cleartext messages are (or can be encoded as) elements of G (although this condition can be relaxed|see x5.2).

Reference-contexts: Nor do they even rule out the 4 possibility of breaking the scheme without finding some kind of weakness in the hash function, as recently shown by Canetti, Goldreich, and Halevi <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: All of the previously known schemes provably secure under standard intractability assumptions are completely impractical (albeit polynomial time), as they rely on general and expensive constructions for non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs. This includes non-standard schemes like Rackoff and Si-mon's as well. Practical Schemes. Damgard <ref> [8] </ref> proposed a practical scheme that he conjectured to be secure against lunch-time attacks; however, this scheme is not known to be provably secure, and is in fact demonstrably insecure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack.

Reference-contexts: A different notion of security against active attacks, called non-malleability, was proposed by Dolev, Dwork, and Naor <ref> [9] </ref>. Here, the adversary also has access to a decryption oracle, but his goal is not to obtain partial information about the target ciphertext, but rather, to create another encryption of a different message that is related in some interesting way to the original, encrypted message. <p> In this paper, we will always use the phrase adaptive chosen ciphertext attack for Rackoff and Simon's definition, to distinguish it from Naor and Yung's definition. Previous Work Provably Secure Schemes. Naor and Yung [19] presented the first scheme provably secure against lunch-time attacks. Subsequently, Dolev, Dwork, and Naor <ref> [9] </ref> presented a scheme that is provably secure against adaptive 3 chosen ciphertext attack.

Reference-contexts: For example, for a non-malleable encryption scheme, given an encryption of n, it should be infeasible to create an encryption of n + 1. It turns out that non-malleability and security against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack are equivalent <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the proof of security relies only on a standard intractability assumption, namely, the hardness of the Diffie-Hellman decision problem in the underlying group. 1 The hardness of the Diffie-Hellman decision problem is essentially equiv-alent to the semantic security of the basic El Gamal encryption scheme <ref> [12] </ref>. Thus, with just a bit more computation, we get security against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack, whereas the basic El Gamal scheme is completely insecure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack. Actually, the basic scheme we describe also requires a universal one-way hash function.

Reference-contexts: The significance of our contribution is that it provides a scheme that is provably secure and practical at the same time. There appears to be no other encryption scheme in the literature that enjoys both of these properties simultaneously. Chosen Ciphertext Security Semantic security, defined by Goldwasser and Micali <ref> [14] </ref>, captures the intuition that an adversary should not be able to obtain any partial information about a message given its encryption. However, this guarantee of secrecy is only valid when the adversary is completely passive, i.e., can only eavesdrop.

Reference-contexts: For the hash function H used in the encryption scheme, something like SHA-1, possibly keyed, would be appropriate. The security of this variant is easily proved using the techniques of this paper, along with the left-over hash lemma <ref> [15] </ref>, assuming the cipher C is semantically secure. 5.3 A hash-free variant We can actually eliminate the hash function H from the scheme, so that the security can be based strictly on the Diffie-Hellman decision problem for an arbitrary group G.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper, we present and analyze a new public key cryptosystem that is provably secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (as defined by Rackoff and Simon <ref> [20] </ref>). The scheme is quite practical, requiring just a few exponentiations over a group. <p> Indeed, semantic security offers no guarantee of secrecy at all if an adversary can mount an active attack, i.e., inject messages into a network or otherwise influence the behavior of parties in the network. To deal with active attacks, Rackoff and Simon <ref> [20] </ref> defined the notion of security against an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack. If an adversary can inject messages into a network, these messages may be encryptions, and the adversary may be able to extract partial information about the corresponding cleartexts through its interactions with the parties in the network. <p> Previous Work Provably Secure Schemes. Naor and Yung [19] presented the first scheme provably secure against lunch-time attacks. Subsequently, Dolev, Dwork, and Naor [9] presented a scheme that is provably secure against adaptive 3 chosen ciphertext attack. Rackoff and Simon <ref> [20] </ref> present and prove the security of an encryption scheme, but their scheme is actually not a public key scheme in the traditional sense: in their scheme, all users|both senders and receivers|require public keys, and moreover, a trusted center is required to perform certain functions.
