Abstract: This paper considers generic recursion schemes for programs which recurse over multiple inductive structures simultaneously, such as equality, zip and the nth element of a list function. Such schemes have been notably absent from previous work. This paper defines a uniform mechanism for defining such programs and shows that these programs satisfy generic theorems. These theorems are the basis for an automatic improvement algorithm. This algorithm is an improvement over the algorithm presented earlier [15] because, in addition to inducting over multiple structures, it can be incorporated into any algebraic language and is no longer restricted to a "safe" subset.

A treeless term is one which is exactly analogous to a safe term, but is described in a much different manner due to the lack of structure imposed on such terms.

Reference-contexts: Those not removed are recognizable and are simply skipped over in the improvement phase. The application domain of our fusion algorithm is more restricted than the domain of all these methods, but our algorithm is more effective since it is fully automated. In <ref> [9] </ref> a new, simple, but very effective, automatic technique is presented for implementing deforestation in a compiler. This method requires that each list-producing functions is expressed as a build call and each list-consuming functions is expressed as a foldr call.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In previous work [15, 16] we have shown how programming algebraically with generic recursion schemes provides a theory amenable to program calculation <ref> [14] </ref>. This theory provides a basis for automatic optimization techniques which capture many well-known transformations. Unfortunately, these recursion schemes may induct over only one structure at a time, and thus cannot capture such common functions as structural equality, zip, or the function that computes the nth element of a list. <p> list (f n ; f c ) (Cons (a; l)) = f c (a; red list (f n ; f c ) l) For example, length (x) = red list (():Zero; (a; r):Succ (r)) x For each such inductive data type there is a generic theorem called the promotion theorem <ref> [13, 14] </ref>. <p> The foldr operator is similar to our list reduction while 10 the build operator is a dual-like function of foldr (this technique is an automation of the HyloSplit theorem of Meijer et al. <ref> [14] </ref>). The technique simply fuses adjacent foldr-build pairs by eliminating them completely ((foldr f ) ffi (build g) = g ffi f ). We believe that this method could be more effective if folds are promoted downwards or builds are promoted upwards in a term until they fuse. <p> This can be achieved effectively by applying promotion theorems. Our stereotyped recursion schemes as well as the promotion theorems are highly influenced by the Squiggol school of program construction <ref> [13, 14, 12, 1] </ref>.

We will not present the detailed proof here. Instead we will present a sketch of the proof. The detailed correctness proof for the normalization algorithm which includes only the simple promotion theorem can be found elsewhere <ref> [16] </ref>. Theorem 3 (Correctness of the Normalization Algorithm) The normalization algorithm always pre serves the meaning of a term. Proof sketch: All the transformation rules of the normalization algorithm can be easily proved to preserve the meaning of a term, except for the two promotion laws.
