Reference-contexts: Although singular perturbation problems have been studied extensively in asymptotic analysis [1-7] , the results of these studies have, at least so far, not found their way into computational algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, Chin et al. <ref> [8] </ref> were the first to suggest a domain-decomposition algorithm based on asymptotic arguments. Subsequent references addressing domain decomposition 1 in the context of singular perturbation problems are [9-17].

Reference-contexts: If the position of the layers is not known, one can use a variant of the O method developed for the Navier-Stokes equations <ref> [10, 29] </ref>. Note, however, that in the present method the higher-order derivatives are preserved, although the treatment depends on their order of magnitude, whereas normally in the O method higher-order derivatives are dropped.

Reference-contexts: The domain decomposition is combined with a Schwarz alternating procedure, which alternates between the regular domains and the singular layers, and an iterative solution on each subdomain. The Schwarz procedure is implemented in its most elementary form: the subdomains overlap, and Dirichlet data are specified at the interfaces <ref> [24] </ref>. Thus, it is easy to couple different approximations on the various subdomains. The procedure requires the temporary specification of data in the interior of , and its convergence depends on the way these data propagate into the interior of the domain.

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is easy to couple different approximations on the various subdomains. The procedure requires the temporary specification of data in the interior of , and its convergence depends on the way these data propagate into the interior of the domain. As was shown in <ref> [25] </ref>, the propagation factor can be made arbitrarily small for the most common finite-difference schemes, provided the mesh size is properly chosen as a function of ". On each subdomain, the iterative method is designed to generate successive terms in the asymptotic expansion of the solution. <p> decreases almost linearly as " # 0, ku (")j h (") u ("; h ("))k X ( h (") ) = O " log (" 1 ) : (3:10) The asymptotic order of the propagation numbers of the Schwarz alternating procedure, i 0 and i 1 , can be computed <ref> [25, Lemma 4] </ref>. <p> h (") , the truncation error decreases almost linearly as " # 0, ku (")j h (") u ("; h ("))k X ( h (") ) = O " log (" 1 ) : (4:9) The asymptotic order of the propagation numbers of the Schwarz alternating procedure can be computed <ref> [25, Lemma 5] </ref>. <p> The analysis of Section 3 needs modification at several points, because the estimates of the propagation factor and the amplification numbers are more complicated. We will not go into these details here. (A variant of the problem (5.1) was studied in <ref> [25] </ref>.) The solution of (5.1) has a transition layer inside along the piecewise linear curve S, S = f (x; y) 2 : x = 0 if y 0; x = y if y 0g: (5:5) An asymptotic analysis shows that u (") = 1 + o (1) to the left <p> In the regular domain, we have the classical method of lines with the same type of one-dimensional structure for parallelism. Nevertheless, it is difficult to implement the proposed method efficiently on a parallel architecture. In contrast to the approach first proposed in <ref> [25] </ref>, we no longer use the same scheme on each subdomain. Therefore, simply keeping the degrees of freedom the same on each subdomain will not guarantee proper load balancing.
