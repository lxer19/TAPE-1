Abstract: Routing adaptivity is desirable in high performance interconnection networks since it helps in lowering average message latency and increasing network throughput, which in turn can improve system performance. However, adaptive routing has not received adequate attention in commercial routers mainly due to the additional hardware complexity, and the cost and performance degradation that may result from this added complexity. These concerns can be mitigated if one can design a cost-effective router that can support adaptive routing. This paper proposes a three step recipe Look-Ahead routing, intelligent Path Selection, and an Economic Storage implementation, called the LAPSES approach for cost-effective high performance pipelined adaptive router design. The first step, look-ahead routing, reduces a pipeline stage in the router by making table lookup and arbitration concurrent. Next, three new traffic-sensitive path selection heuristics (LRU, LFU and MAX-CREDIT) are proposed to pick one of the available alternate paths. Finally, two techniques for reducing routing table size of the adaptive router are presented. These are called meta-table routing and economical storage. The proposed economical storage needs a routing table of size only 3 n for n-dimensional meshes. All these design ideas are evaluated on a (16 fi 16) mesh network via simulation. We use Duato's fully adaptive algorithm and various traffic patterns to examine the performance benefits. Performance results show that the look-ahead design results in as much as 15 % savings in message latency at low load and is especially attractive for short messages. Together with adaptivity, it can help message latency over the entire workload. The three proposed path selection mechanisms are capable of providing better performance compared to prior schemes. In particular, we argue in favor of the LRU and MAX-CREDIT policies due their ease of implementation. Considering the cost and performance together, the proposed economical storage approach to routing table implementation turns out to be an ideal choice in comparison to full table and meta-table options. We believe the router resulting from these three design enhancements can make adaptive routing a viable choice for interconnects.

Reference-contexts: Also, faster design cycles due to ASIC design approaches and general-purpose applicability of routers (for use in arbitrary topologies and system-area interconnects) have lead to the adoption of programmable routing tables, virtual channels, and increased fault-tolerance features using pipelined router designs <ref> [5, 3, 6] </ref>. An adaptive router should, therefore, adhere to a pipelined design and should exploit all available facilities such as VCs and table based routing. VCs are thus not considered an additional expense. <p> However, in order to increase the throughput, modern routers use a pipelined design <ref> [3, 5, 30] </ref>. Tail/Middle Flit Bypass Path Table Lookup Selection, Arbitration Xbar Route, Buffering VC Mux, Sync Header Flit Path Sync, DeMux, Buffer, Decode The pipelined router models used in this study are called PROUD (for Pipelined ROUter Design) and LA PROUD (for PROUD with Look-Ahead). <p> Contention for 5 resources between the parallel pipes can occur only in the crossbar arbitration and virtual channel multiplexing stages. In a contention-free environment, the key functional unit delays which determine the router cycle time are the table-lookup delay and the arbitration delay <ref> [3] </ref>. Our entire study here is confined to improving the design in these two critical stages of the pipelined router to support adaptivity. Experimental setup: In this study we use the PROUD network simulator to simulate a 256 node two-dimensional (16 fi 16) mesh interconnection network. <p> Deterministic look-ahead routing is used in the SGI SPIDER <ref> [3] </ref> 2 . We extend the concept of look-ahead routing to adaptive routers. 3.2 Adaptive Look-Ahead Routing Adaptive routing implies the possibility of multiple path choices being available at a given router to route a message towards its destination. <p> This delay should be fairly small compared to the arbitration delay in commercial routers some of which use sophisticated and complex arbitration schemes such as the schemes used in the SPIDER <ref> [3, 32] </ref> and Servernet [33]. Hence, we argue that there is minimal or negligible impact on delay 13 of the path-selection cum arbitration unit for an adaptive router compared to that of just the arbitration in a deterministic router. <p> Routing information for nodes which are outside the local cluster is restricted to a single entry per cluster maintained in a cluster table. This cluster table could have a flat structure or further hierarchies. This type of storage savings are used in the SGI-SPIDER (2-level) <ref> [3] </ref> and the Servernet-II router [6] (3-levels).

Reference-contexts: Such an implementation scheme is referred to as full-table routing. Full-table routing has the flexibility of supporting arbitrary network topologies limited only by the number of ports in the router. This approach is used in the Cray T3D and T3E routers <ref> [4, 5] </ref>, as well as the Sun S3.mp router [7]. However, full-table routing by its nature has storage overhead proportional to the maximum number of nodes in the network and thus limits its scalability to large network sizes. A large table RAM size may also lead to slower lookup times.

Reference-contexts: A third component, in addition to switching and flow control, that has a significant impact on network performance is the routing algorithm. Several research studies have shown performance benefits of various adaptive routing schemes compared to oblivious routing <ref> [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] </ref>. Theoretically, it is known that routing adaptivity is a desirable feature since it can lower average message latency at moderate to high load. Further, the ability to use alternate paths improves fault-tolerance properties of the network. <p> A summary of the simulation parameters used in this study is given in Table 2. 2.3 Adaptive Routing Algorithms A number of partially and fully adaptive routing algorithms has been proposed for direct networks <ref> [12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21] </ref>. These algorithms vary in terms of their performance and hardware (VC) requirements. Since 6 we are interested in a cost-effective implementation, we use a fully adaptive routing algorithm that requires the minimum number of VCs. <p> Fig. 11 shows an example of a 9-node 2-D mesh, and shows how the router at an intermediate node 4 = (1; 1) would be programmed for North-Last partially adaptive routing (based on the Turn Model <ref> [12] </ref>). It should be noted from this example that although 2 output ports may be available to route to some destination, specific routing algorithms could deny them for guaranteeing deadlock freedom. <p> In economical storage routing, there is no real loss of flexibility as compared to full-table routing. This is because, all the known mesh routing algorithms such as those in <ref> [12, 14, 15, 19] </ref> can be implemented with the economical storage. Hence, performance of full-table routing and economical storage routing are identical. The results comparing the performance of the two meta-table mapping schemes and the full-table and ES tables are presented in Table 4.

Theoretically, it is known that routing adaptivity is a desirable feature since it can lower average message latency at moderate to high load. Further, the ability to use alternate paths improves fault-tolerance properties of the network. <p> All these design options are examined by simulating a (16 fi 16) 2-D mesh network using these routers. As an example, Duato's fully adaptive algorithm <ref> [14] </ref> is used in this study. We use various synthetic traffic patterns to evaluate the impact on average network latency. <p> The effect of look-ahead is significant for short messages as the latency could reduce by as much as 15%. The LRU, LFU and MAX-CREDIT path selection strategies outperform previously proposed static-XY [27] and MIN-MUX <ref> [14] </ref> policies for all of the nonuniform traffic patterns. The LRU and MAX-CREDIT policies seem to be better choices because of their low cost of implementation. Finally, we observe that meta-table implementation is not an appropriate choice for 2-D mesh networks, although it is cost-effective compared to full-table design. <p> A summary of the simulation parameters used in this study is given in Table 2. 2.3 Adaptive Routing Algorithms A number of partially and fully adaptive routing algorithms has been proposed for direct networks <ref> [12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21] </ref>.

In this paper, we use Duato's fully adaptive algorithm <ref> [14] </ref> for performance analyses, and these discussions are valid for other fully adaptive algorithms as well since they exhibit almost similar behavior. 3 Look Ahead Routing 3.1 Basic Look Ahead Routing It was seen in Section 2 that table lookup and path selection cum arbitration operations are serially dependent. <p> We propose three dynamic path selection heuristics (PSHs), called LRU, LFU and MAX-CREDIT, and compare them against STATIC-XY and another dynamic scheme referred to as MIN-MUX in this paper. MIN-MUX uses the physical channel with the minimum degree of VC-multiplexing (For details about the MIN-MUX PSH, see <ref> [14] </ref>). Least Frequently Used (LFU) PSH: This PSH selects the output port (among the candidates) with the lowest usage count until that time. It works on the premise that if link utilizations are balanced, it will result in improved network performance. <p> In economical storage routing, there is no real loss of flexibility as compared to full-table routing. This is because, all the known mesh routing algorithms such as those in <ref> [12, 14, 15, 19] </ref> can be implemented with the economical storage. Hence, performance of full-table routing and economical storage routing are identical. The results comparing the performance of the two meta-table mapping schemes and the full-table and ES tables are presented in Table 4. <p> The results further suggest that the look-ahead feature should be more attractive for short message transfer typically encountered in shared memory systems. It is shown that the new path selection strategies can utilize the available paths more prudently than the static-XY scheme and the MIN-MUX scheme <ref> [14] </ref> and hence can contribute to low message latency. The network latency thus reduces significantly for non-uniform traffic patterns. The two-level, meta-table implementation of adaptive routing algorithm severely affects the performance in a 2-D mesh due to traffic congestion at the boundary nodes between clusters.

Researchers and router designers have commonly used dimension-order selection <ref> [27, 19] </ref>, random selection [16], and first-available-free-path selection [6] for their simplicity. These criteria are static in the sense that they do not make use of current network conditions to select a path, which is likely to experience the lowest contention. <p> In economical storage routing, there is no real loss of flexibility as compared to full-table routing. This is because, all the known mesh routing algorithms such as those in <ref> [12, 14, 15, 19] </ref> can be implemented with the economical storage. Hence, performance of full-table routing and economical storage routing are identical. The results comparing the performance of the two meta-table mapping schemes and the full-table and ES tables are presented in Table 4.

Reference-contexts: Further, the ability to use alternate paths improves fault-tolerance properties of the network. In spite of these advantages, very few commercial router designs have adopted this idea (T3E router [5], Servernet-II [6] and Transputer/C-104 <ref> [10, 22] </ref> switch to a limited extent). Complexity and cost are the main reasons attributed to the limited commercial adoption of adaptive routing. <p> The number of such non-overlapping intervals is equal to the number of router exit ports. It has been shown that interval labeling schemes can be derived for any connected network, hence also the name universal routing. The Transputer/C-104 switch <ref> [10, 22] </ref> uses interval routing. This scheme has significant advantages in terms of the small table size, excellent scalability and applicability to arbitrary topologies.

Reference-contexts: Complexity and cost are the main reasons attributed to the limited commercial adoption of adaptive routing. Adaptivity typically requires the use of virtual channels (VCs) for deadlock freedom and more complex routing schemes, which lead to additional hardware cost, complexity and slower router designs <ref> [23, 24] </ref>. Adaptive routing is not always suitable, particularly for uniform traffic patterns and in situations where out-of-order message delivery can lead to long queuing delays. Parallel applications may not utilize the benefits of VCs and routing flexibility unless they are communication intensive [25, 26].

The two main cost factors associated with providing adaptivity in a router are the number of VCs required and the implementation of the algorithm itself. It was argued in <ref> [24] </ref> that addition of each VC slows down the router clock by 2530%. This is only true for a non-pipelined design. Current commercial routers are being designed with increasingly large transistor and area budgets.

Reference-contexts: Decoupling of table-lookup and path-selection cum arbitration functions through a technique called look-ahead routing has the potential to reduce pipeline-latency in adaptive routers. * When multiple paths are available for routing to a given destination, a unique path has to be selected for the next route <ref> [27] </ref>. Selection of a good path among the available alternatives is important for improved performance. This issue does not arise in deterministic routers. * Adhering to a table-based router design, adaptive routing requires multiple path choices to be stored in routing tables, thus increasing table storage cost. <p> The effect of look-ahead is significant for short messages as the latency could reduce by as much as 15%. The LRU, LFU and MAX-CREDIT path selection strategies outperform previously proposed static-XY <ref> [27] </ref> and MIN-MUX [14] policies for all of the nonuniform traffic patterns. The LRU and MAX-CREDIT policies seem to be better choices because of their low cost of implementation. <p> The criterion for selection is called the path selection function <ref> [27] </ref>.

A path selection function is required in the routing decision block to select one of multiple valid output ports.

Reference-contexts: Messages are injected with exponential inter-arrival times for 4 different traffic patterns (uniform, transpose, bit-reversal and perfect-shuffle traffic). These traffic patterns are consistent with standard definitions for synthetic traffic patterns used in interconnection network studies <ref> [31] </ref>. We present performance results as the average network latency versus normalized load. Normalized load is defined as the ratio of the message injection rate per-cycle to that injection rate, required to reach the bisection bandwidth of the network under node-uniform traffic [31]. <p> synthetic traffic patterns used in interconnection network studies <ref> [31] </ref>.
