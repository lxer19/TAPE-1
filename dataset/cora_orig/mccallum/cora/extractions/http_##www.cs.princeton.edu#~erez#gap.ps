Title: THE HARDNESS OF APPROXIMATION GAP LOCATION  
Author: Erez Petrank 
Note: Subject classifications. 03D15, 68Q25, 68Q15, 68R10.  
Abstract: We refine the complexity analysis of approximation problems by relating it to a new parameter called gap location. Many of the results obtained so far for approximations yield satisfactory analysis with respect to this refined parameter, but some known results (e.g., max-k-colorability, max 3-dimensional matching and max not-all-equal 3sat) fall short of doing so. As a second contribution, our work fills the gap in these cases by presenting new reductions. Next, we present definitions and hardness results of new approximation versions of some NP-complete optimization problems. The problems we treat are vertex cover (for which we define a different optimization problem from the one treated in Papadimitriou & Yannakakis 1991), k-edge coloring, and set splitting. Key words. Hardness of approximation; approximation algorithms; computational complexity; NP-hardness.

The first class contains optimization problems for which it is NP-hard to determine whether an input I has OP T (I) = N (I). This class contains problems as max-sat <ref> (proven hard to approximate by Arora et al. 1992) </ref> and max k-colorability (for k 3) (Papadimitriou & Yannakakis 1991 and Section 3). The other class contains problems for which it is easy to decide whether an input I has OP T (I) = N (I).

Reference-contexts: In particular, we define approximation versions of: ffi vertex cover (Karp 1972). Note that the version that was treated by Papadimitriou & Yannakakis (1991) is in the spirit of the largest solution. We treat the version that seeks the quality of the best solution. ffi kedge colorability (chromatic index) <ref> (Hoyler 1981 and Leven & Galil 1983) </ref>. In this case, it is not hard to approximate the size of the smallest solution since there is a polynomial time algorithm that colors the edges of a graph of degree k with k + 1 colors (Vizing's Theorem, see Berge 1973). <p> Note that jEj jV j B=2, and recall that the hard gap for min vertex cover-B was shown hard for K = fi (jV j). 2.

Reference-contexts: We thus settle the problem raised in the previous subsection. In our proof, we use a different reduction than the one in Papadimitriou & Yannakakis (1991). Two other problems that were previously shown hard to approximate using a gap location different from 1 are 3-dimensional matching <ref> (Kann 1991) </ref> and not-all-equal-3sat (Papadimitriou and Yannakakis 1991).

We shortly describe the reduction, following the presentation of Garey & Johnson (1979).
