Abstract: Given a compactly supported function ' : IR s ! C and the space S spanned by its integer translates, we study quasiinterpolants which reproduce (entirely or in part) the space H of all expo-nentials in S. We do this by imitating the action on H of the associated semi-discrete convolution operator 'fl 0 by a convolution fl, being a compactly supported distribution, and inverting fl jH by another local convolution operator fl. This leads to a unified theory for quasiinterpolants on regular grids, showing that each specific construction now in the literature corresponds to a special choice of and . The natural choice = ' is singled out, and the interrelation between 'fl 0 and 'fl is analyzed in detail. We use these observations in the conversion of the local approximation order of an exponential space H into approximation rates from any space which contains H and is spanned by the hZZ s - translates of a single compactly supported function '. The bounds obtained are attractive in the sense that they rely only on H and the basic quantities diam supp ' and h s k'k 1 = b'(0).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, it is worthwhile to note the following: (2.6) Corollary. If the finite T C s satisfies (2.5), then H T := Exp T " H (') is D-invariant. The converse of this corollary is not valid (cf. Example 7.1 in <ref> [BAR 1 ] </ref>), yet is true for univariate splines (cf. [R 2 ; Proposition 4.6]). Proof. Since H (') is finite-dimensional, we may consider the smallest polynomial spaces Q (necessarily finite-dimensional) for which H T P 2T e Q .

Reference-contexts: When the S h are derived from S (') by processes other than dilation, the polynomials in S (') cease to play the above decisive role. Specifically, the approximation order for exponential box splines was established in <ref> [DR] </ref> by choosing the S h in such a way that each contains the space H ('):= the space of all exponentials in S ('), with an exponential being any linear combination of products of polynomials with the pure exponentials (1:1) e : x 7! e h;xi ; 2 C s <p> For notational convenience, we choose H = H ('), and simply use "regular" in the sense of "regular with respect to H (')".
