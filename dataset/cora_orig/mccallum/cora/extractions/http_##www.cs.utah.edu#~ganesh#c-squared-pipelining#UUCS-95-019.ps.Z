Abstract: With the escalation of clock frequencies and the increasing ratio of wire- to gate-delays, clock skew is a major problem to be overcome in tomorrow's high-speed VLSI chips. Also, with an increasing number of stages switching simultaneously comes the problem of higher peak power consumption. In our past work, we have proposed a novel scheme called Counterflow-Clocked(C 2 ) Pipelining to combat these problem, and discussed methods for composing C 2 pipelined stages. In this paper, we analyze, in great detail, the timing constraints to be obeyed in designing basic C 2 pipelined stages as well as in composing C 2 pipelined stages. C 2 pipelining is well suited for systems that exhibit mostly uni-directional data flows as well as possess mostly nearest-neighbor connections. We illustrate C 2 pipelining on such a design with several design examples. C 2 pipelining eases the distribution of high speed clocks, shortens the clock period by eliminating global clock signals, allows natural use of level-sensitive dynamic latches, and generates less internal switching noise due to the uniformly distributed latch operation. By applying C 2 pipelining and its composition methods to build a system, VLSI designers can substitute the global clock skew problem with many local one-sided delay constraints.
