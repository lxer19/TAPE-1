Abstract: Metered mail provides substantial opportunities for fraud. (Indeed, losses due to meter fraud in the United States are said to exceed $100 million annually.) We apply cryptographic techniques to prevent several types of improper use of metering indicia. This paper describes a mail system that combines off-the-shelf barcode technology, tamper-proof devices, and cryptography in a fully-integrated secure franking system. This system provides protection against:

Reference-contexts: The same types of secure devices could be used for both postage meters and computer-generated postage. The designer of cryptographic postal indicia system must exercise care in using secure devices. Some purportedly secure devices have turned out to have serious flaws in them <ref> [1] </ref>; others may reveal information about cryptographic keys when attacked by clever use of clock information [6] or when an adversary deliberately induces hardware faults [2].

Reference-contexts: In the United States, there are approximately 1.5 million postage meters in use which collectively account for approximately $20 billion in postal revenue [23].

There are over 82,000 postage meters in the US that are currently reported as lost or stolen [25].

Reference-contexts: This argues that we should use a signature mechanism with fast verification time. The two most widely used signature mechanisms are RSA [15] and DSA <ref> [9] </ref>; of these RSA is best suited for our purposes because it gives the fastest signature verification times. RSA is a block cipher; it signs plaintext in fixed length blocks. Given the state of cryptography today, we recommend that use of RSA with 128 byte blocks.

Reference-contexts: A slightly less secure design also allows postal meters to print out cryptographic indicia. Central to our design is the use of tamper-proof computing devices, such as those in the specified in the US FIPS 140-1 standard <ref> [10] </ref>. Using this technology, we can produce secure, unforgeable postal indicia. (For further details and qualifications, see the discussion in Section 7.) 3 Traditional Indicia Here we review the structure of traditional indicia and define necessary properties for cryptographic indicia. <p> Several appropriate tamper-proof platforms exist, and more are forthcoming. Some of these are very secure, satisfying the highest security level specified by US Federal Information Processing Standard 140-1 <ref> [10] </ref>. (This publication gives four security levels for cryptographic modules. The highest levels of security are considered nearly unbreakable systems. <p> But the exploitation of these devices is not without problems: we have already discussed in Section 7 unexpected weakness in purportedly tamper-proof devices. But beyond these weaknesses, the model of an electronic wallet does not match the standard definition for tamper-proof (and tamper-resistant) devices: the FIPS 140-1 standard <ref> [10] </ref>. We clearly want to make improper manipulation of electronic wallet register values impossible.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, we can include cryptographically signed information in the indicia to prove the authenticity of the indicia. By including information such as the mailing date and the zip code of the sender and receiver, we can also guard against forged or copied indicia. Pastor <ref> [11] </ref> gave a rough outline of how such a system could work. Unfortunately, Pastor's system and similar proprietary proposals are vulnerable to additional types of attack: Cryptographic techniques are vulnerable to misuse, leading to systems that can be successfully attacked by an adversary.

Reference-contexts: There are over 82,000 postage meters in the US that are currently reported as lost or stolen [25]. The US Postal Inspection Service recently brought criminal charges in separate cases in New York and Boston; each involved more than $4 million dollars in postage meter fraud <ref> [14] </ref>. To address these problems, we propose a new system for printing postage indicia with cryptographic information. This system allows a PC or workstation with a laser printer and a tamper-proof device to produce unforgeable postage indicia. This paper describes that design.

Reference-contexts: The inclusion of time stamps allows us to set a maximum "lifetime" for an indicia. Serial numbers trace the source of the attack to a unique postage meter licensee. The second property is achieved using cryptography. Indicia information is digitally represented, cryptographically signed <ref> [15] </ref>, and printed on an envelope as a 2-D barcode 4 . Such barcodes can be printed using commodity laser printers, and they can be scanned and re-digitized at a post office. <p> For a cryptographic postal indicia system, the bottleneck is signature verification: a typical postoffice will verify many more mail items than a typical mailer will generate. This argues that we should use a signature mechanism with fast verification time. The two most widely used signature mechanisms are RSA <ref> [15] </ref> and DSA [9]; of these RSA is best suited for our purposes because it gives the fastest signature verification times. RSA is a block cipher; it signs plaintext in fixed length blocks. Given the state of cryptography today, we recommend that use of RSA with 128 byte blocks.
