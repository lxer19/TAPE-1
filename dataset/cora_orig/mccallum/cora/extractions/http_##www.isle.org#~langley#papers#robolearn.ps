Title: Place Learning in Dynamic Real-World Environments

Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for mobile robot localization designed for use in dynamic environments. Our approach integrates evidence grids within a topological/metric network that can be used for navigation. Place learning consists of associating evidence grids with places in the topological network. Place recognition consists of building an evidence grid at the current location and using a registration procedure based on hill climbing to find the best match between the current grid and the grids associated with places in the network. This approach has been implemented on a real mobile robot and has been tested in a real-world office environment containing multiple forms of dynamic change. In these experiments, this approach demonstrated robust localization in the presence of transient changes (such as moving people) and lasting changes (such as rearranged furniture) in the environment.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction A central issue in mobile robotics is localization: how can a robot use its sensors to determine its location? A particular example is the "kidnaped robot problem" <ref> (Engelson, 1994) </ref> where, once a robot has explored its environment, it is turned off and transported to an unknown location. At the new location, the robot must use its sensors to survey its surroundings and determine its position based upon the knowledge previously acquired about the environment. <p> Related Work Much research has been conducted on place recognition for mobile robots using a variety of techniques and knowledge structures, including distinctive places (Kuipers & Byun, 1993), gateways (Kor-tenkamp, 1993), image signatures <ref> (Engelson, 1994) </ref>, and landmarks (Greiner & Isukapalli, 1996). However, none of this research has addressed the issue of place recognition in dynamic environments, where the appearance of places may change over time.

Reference-contexts: These results are preliminary, but promising, and we plan more precise, quantitative performance measurements in the near future. 5.

Reference-contexts: However, none of this research has addressed the issue of place recognition in dynamic environments, where the appearance of places may change over time. In our previous research, we have described a system that builds evidence grids for different places and uses case-based techniques for place recognition <ref> (Langley & Pfleger, 1995) </ref>. However, we tested this approach only in static environments. We have also conducted research on robot localization in dynamic environments using evidence grids (Yamauchi, 1996), but that work was aimed at correcting dead-reckoning errors using a grid constructed for a single home location.

Reference-contexts: Any number of sensor readings from any number of sensors can be combined as long as models exist for each sensor type. 2.2.2 Updating Evidence Grids Formally, evidence grids provide a means for combining information from sensor readings in an elegant way <ref> (Moravec, 1988) </ref>. If X represents information such as a sensor reading, then p (ojX) is the probability that a cell is occupied given X, and p (:ojX) is the probability that this cell is not occupied given X.
