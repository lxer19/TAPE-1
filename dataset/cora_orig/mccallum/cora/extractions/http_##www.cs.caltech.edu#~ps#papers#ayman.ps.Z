Abstract: Modeling objects with subdivision surfaces has been the subject of investigation by many researchers. One problem that needs to be addressed to make subdivision surfaces useful for modeling real objects is reducing the continuity of these surfaces. That is, current smooth subdivision schemes need to be extended to incorporate the ability to model objects with sharp edges and vertices. In this paper we propose a new approach to edge insertion on four-directional C 1 quadratic box spline surfaces. Edges are inserted as knot-lines. The main idea is to use the commutativity of subdivision and knot insertion to compute special subdivision rules close to the inserted edge. A technique for decomposing the surface around an extraordinary vertex is also described. Sharp vertices can be introduced into the surface using this technique. The approach is easy to implement and can be generalized to work on other classes of subdivision schemes.

Reference-contexts: Manipulation of these modeled objects depends greatly on the properties of the associated mathematical models. Several mathematical representations have been proposed and used. One of the emerging techniques that has been receiving extensive attention in recent years is the use of subdivision surfaces <ref> [1, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16] </ref>. Subdivision surfaces are obtained as the limit of a recursive refinement process applied to polyhedra. The power of this technique comes from its ability to model complicated shapes with much simpler polyhedra using a few subdivision rules. <p> Multiresolution techniques, such as wavelets, can be defined using this hierarchy to obtain different level-of-details representations of these surfaces [5]. 1 The quality of a subdivision surface depends on the properties of the subdivision scheme that builds it. Several subdivision schemes have been proposed in the literature <ref> [1, 6, 7, 11, 13] </ref>. Box splines provide a natural framework for building subdivision surfaces.

[12] insert edges and vertices on subdivision surfaces; however they address only subdivision over triangles.

Reference-contexts: The canonical example of a curve subdivision scheme is Chaikin's algorithm <ref> [2] </ref> which computes quadratic B-splines, with uniform knots, recursively. One step of the algorithm is shown in Figure 1. gon before (after) subdivision. The algorithm starts with a control polygon.

Reference-contexts: This property follows from index invariance, which means that the same subdivision rules are used irrespective of vertex indexing. For a circulant matrix S n with first row a 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a n1 , a well known result from linear algebra <ref> [3] </ref> asserts that the eigenvalues of S n are the values of the polynomial n1 X a k x kj evaluated at x = ! = e 2i 8 Now to compute the entries of S n it suffices to specify its eigenvalues.

Reference-contexts: Several subdivision schemes have been proposed in the literature [1, 6, 7, 11, 13]. Box splines provide a natural framework for building subdivision surfaces. A well established theory of box splines, over regular parametric grids, has been developed <ref> [4] </ref>. In this paper we adopt the four-directional, C 1 quadratic box spline, as an example subdivision scheme, though the treatment can be extended to deal with other subdivision schemes as well. The above mentioned box spline builds C 1 piecewise quadratic surfaces only over polyhedra of special topology. <p> They are instances of the more general polyhedral splines. In two variables, a degree n box spline is the projection of an n + 2-dimensional hyper-cube to the plane. The reader is referred to the excellent book by de Boor et. al. <ref> [4] </ref> and the bibliography therein for a more elaborate presentation of box splines. For our purposes, it suffices to recall the relevant properties of the box spline at hand.

Reference-contexts: The topology of the polyhedron automatically ensures correct connectivity of the final surface. Subdivision also automatically produces a hierarchy of polyhedra, that approximates the final limit surface. Multiresolution techniques, such as wavelets, can be defined using this hierarchy to obtain different level-of-details representations of these surfaces <ref> [5] </ref>. 1 The quality of a subdivision surface depends on the properties of the subdivision scheme that builds it. Several subdivision schemes have been proposed in the literature [1, 6, 7, 11, 13]. Box splines provide a natural framework for building subdivision surfaces.

The power of this technique comes from its ability to model complicated shapes with much simpler polyhedra using a few subdivision rules. <p> By making sure that the spaces of polyhedra obtained after edge insertion contain those before the insertion we shall be able to express smooth C 1 -limit surfaces as many patches that meet smoothly. This last property distinguishes this work from the work of Hoppe et. al. <ref> [12] </ref> where a smooth surface must be perturbed to allow for its representation as multiple smooth patches. The first section of this paper introduces the notation and some background material on subdivision in general and the box spline we are going to use as a case study. <p> The main contribution of this paper is the edge and vertex insertion algorithms for the box spline surface and the ideas used to develop them. Some edge insertion algorithms are readily available in the literature, but only for special tensor product configurations [1, 6]. Hoppe et al. <ref> [12] </ref> insert edges and vertices on subdivision surfaces; however they address only subdivision over triangles. <p> In Section 3.1 we discuss our overall strategy for edge insertion, and define precisely what we mean by edge insertion, then we give the actual construction in Section 3.2. 3.1 Strategy To insert sharp edges and vertices on the limit surface, we take an approach similar to Hoppe et. al. <ref> [12] </ref>, using a tagging scheme to mark vertices and edges of the initial control polyhedron that we want sharpened and then applying different subdivision rules depending on the tags. The essence of the solution is the computation of these different rules. <p> In the next subsection we discuss the properties of this edge insertion algorithm. 3.3 Properties of Edge Insertion Algorithm There are many differences between the edge insertion algorithm of Section 3.2 and the technique proposed by Hoppe et. al <ref> [12] </ref>. One of the main such differences is that the algorithm we proposed enjoys the space containment property, which allows for representing smooth surfaces as multiple patches that meet smoothly, while Hoppe's scheme does not. One of the fundamental and appealing properties of B-splines is that of space containment.

In the Appendix we prove the tangent plane continuity of the limit surface resulting from using the subdivision mask (7). The proof is done using Reif's analysis <ref> [14] </ref>, by building the Characteristic Map of the subdivision scheme and proving that it is regular and injective. 2.3 Examples in Section 2.2.
