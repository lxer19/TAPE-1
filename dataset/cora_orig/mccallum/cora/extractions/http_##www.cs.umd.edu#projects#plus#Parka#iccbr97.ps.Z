Title: ForMAT and Parka: A Technology Integration Experiment and Beyond  
Author: David Rager James Hendler and Alice Mulvehill

Abstract: This report describes a Technology Integration Experiment (TIE) between the University of Maryland and The MITRE Corporation which was undertaken as part of the (D)Arpa/Rome Laboratory Planning Initiative (ARPI). This work led to an integration of the UM Parka-DB tool into the MITRE ForMAT transportation planning tool.

Reference-contexts: CBP can save considerable time over planning from scratch (generative planning), thus offering a potential (heuristic) mechanism for handling intractable problems. The CaPER system <ref> [8] </ref>, focused on new approaches to CBP. <p> These plans could be merged and harmful interactions among them resolved using annotations on a plan to capture interdependencies among its actions <ref> [8, 7, 5, 9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In particular, one drawback of CBP systems has been the need for a highly structured memory that requires significant domain engineering and complex memory preindexing schemes to enable efficient case retrieval In contrast, the CaPER CBP system used the Parka high performance knowledge representation system <ref> [9] </ref> to retrieve plans quickly from a large memory that was not preindexed. Thus, it was relatively inexpensive to access memory frequently, and memory could be probed flexibly at case retrieval time. <p> These plans could be merged and harmful interactions among them resolved using annotations on a plan to capture interdependencies among its actions <ref> [8, 7, 5, 9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In particular, ForMAT users may find additional information such as aircraft and vehicle specifications, airport capacity, maps, or weather information helpful when creating new TPFDDs. The HERMES system <ref> [10] </ref> was developed at the University of Maryland by VS Subrahmanian to Fig. 5.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, for a more concise comparison, we needed a set of specific queries representing a "typical" use of ForMAT. MITRE provided a set of queries for this purpose. In particular, as part of the Joint Warfare Interoperability Demonstrations (JWID), ForMAT was configured to communicate with the TARGET system <ref> [11] </ref>. One set of queries in this experiment required 17 different searches of the casebase with a wide range of queries including both FM and ULN features. Our comparison tests showed that the FMs returned by the two systems were the same, but PARKA was significantly faster than ForMAT.
