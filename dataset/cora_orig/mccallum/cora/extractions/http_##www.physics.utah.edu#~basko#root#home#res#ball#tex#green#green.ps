Abstract: The spatial distribution of the action and energy in the colour fields of flux-tubes is studied in lattice SU (2) field theory for static quarks at separations up to 1 fm. Special attention is paid to the structure of the colour fields associated with an excited flux-tube with E u symmetry. We compare our results with hadronic string and flux-tube models. Sum rules are used to extract generalised fi-functions, to describe the expected colour field behaviour and to cross check the methods used.

Reference-contexts: This has been undertaken for the ground state (A 1g ) previously <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. Comparison with models is most appropriate at large R where string-like behaviour is expected. Here we are able to reach R = 8 which corresponds to a separation of order 1 fm.

Reference-contexts: This self energy should be the same for longitudinal and 8 transverse sum rules and we find agreement with a common expression. A non-zero value arises naturally in the derivation <ref> [3] </ref> of these sum rules. The satisfactory agreement between the sum over plaquette correlations and the sum rule expressions gives confidence that we are able to measure the colour field around a static quark and antiquark. <p> However, it is unlikely that any semiclassical model - such as the IP model would be able to reproduce the much larger action than energy (by a factor of roughly ten) that we find and which has its origin <ref> [3, 4] </ref> in the trace anomaly of QCD.

Reference-contexts: This is consistent with our estimates of the excited state contaminations h given above. We now discuss the evaluation of the left hand sides of the sum rules. One obstacle is the presence of the derivative dV =dR. Since only discrete values of R are measured, one way forward <ref> [8] </ref> is to eliminate this derivative between the three sum rules which still allows the generalised fi-functions b and f to be determined. Here we study the sum rules in a more comprehensive way by explicitly estimating the derivative. <p> We use the values of the generalised fi-functions determined previously <ref> [8] </ref>, namely b = 0:35 and f = 0:61 as an illustration. After choosing values for the self energy terms as discussed below, we find an excellent overall agreement. <p> A somewhat steeper slope than that illustrated (b = 0:35) would fit better particularly if the T = 4 data are selected. A preferred value for this comparison would be b = 0:33. This is compatible with our determination of ref. <ref> [8] </ref> which quoted b = 0:35 (2).

Reference-contexts: Thus a perturbative evaluation of b is unreliable. The fi-function has also been studied non-perturbatively on a lattice by matching the measured potentials at two fi values. Between fi = 2:4 and 2.5, this gave <ref> [9] </ref> b = 0:277 (4). The value determined here is the derivative at fi = 2:4 rather than coming from a finite difference. The qualitative features of the two approaches are in agreement, however.

Reference-contexts: Consider an interquark potential given by V (R) = e=R + KR + V 0 , where the coefficient e 0:25 for the A 1g potential (this is the `Coulomb' coefficient) while in string models we expect e = for the first excited string mode (which corresponds <ref> [10] </ref> to the E u case). Then the `transverse energy' sum rule [Eq. (14)] will relate the sum over transverse energy fluctuations to e=R. This is consistent with the much larger transverse energy seen for the excited gluonic case (Fig. 8) compared to the symmetric ground state potential (Fig. 7).

Reference-contexts: In order to render the string approach applicable, Isgur and Paton <ref> [15] </ref> proposed a flux-tube model in which the string degrees of freedom are reduced by considering a string made of N equally spaced masses. <p> These features are compared with string inspired models and with intuition from sum rules. Although no comprehensive model for the observed behaviour is currently available, two positive features emerge. Firstly, the Isgur-Paton 15 model <ref> [15] </ref> predicts an energy profile that has a very similar shape to that of the electric field squared (E ) on the lattice (Figs. 10c,d) and, secondly, the Dual Potential model of Baker, Ball and Zachariasen predicts the correct trend for the shape of the lattice energy profile (Table 3).

Reference-contexts: One possibility is to study different components of the total energy and to identify separately the electric (E) and magnetic (B) terms in Eq. (5) with the kinetic energy (K) and the potential energy (P ) of the IP model. In fact in ref. <ref> [16] </ref> for (2+1) dimensions, the direct identifications E $ K and B $ P are, indeed, shown to be a good. <p> This, of course, is natural, since B arises from the motion of the flux-tube, which in the IP model is non-relativistic leading to only a small B and so can never be comparable to E. Therefore, a better identification <ref> [16] </ref> could be to compare the total IP energy with E. In fact this is already implied in the original IP work. The result is shown in Figs. 10c,d for the A 1g and E u states respectively.
