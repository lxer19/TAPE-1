Abstract: In this paper describes procedures for solving each of the three types of partial differential equations: hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic, by means of the Sinc convolution procedure, after transformation of the differential equations to equivalent integral equation formulations. We apply the procedure to the solution of three and `three + one' (i.e., 3 space and one time dimension) dimensional partial differential equations. Whereas different numerical methods are used in practice for solving elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDE, the present paper uses essentially the same procedure for all three of these equations. The time complexity of computation to solve a d-dimensional problem on a sequential machine (i.e., the amount of time required to obtain a solution to within ") under suitable assumptions of analyticity, allowing for possible singularities in the coefficients on the boundaries of the regions is of the order of (log(")) 2d+2 . fl Supported by NSF grant # CCR-9307602

Reference-contexts: In the present article we present a unified approach to solve the integral equation formulation of solutions to each of the three classes of partial differential equations, via Sinc convolutions. We shall use Sinc terminology in the present paper. An excellent presentation of this terminology is given in <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Next, we determine matrices A j , X j , and S j , such that A 1 = h 1 I m 1 D (1= 0 1 ; (1) 2 ) = X 2 S 2 X 1 (2.2) (1) m j is defined as in <ref> [1, Sec. 3.4] </ref>) above, and the S j are diagonal matrices, S j = diag [s (j) (j) We require the two dimensional "Laplace transform" F (s (1) ; s (2) ) = 0 0 dx dy; (2.4) which we assume to exist for all s (j) 2 + , with
