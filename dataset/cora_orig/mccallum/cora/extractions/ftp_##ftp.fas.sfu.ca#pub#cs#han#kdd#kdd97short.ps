Abstract: In this paper, we employ a novel approach to metarule-guided, multi-dimensional association rule mining which explores a data cube structure. We propose algorithms for metarule-guided mining: given a metarule containing p predicates, we compare mining on an n-dimensional (n-D) cube structure (where p &lt; n) with mining on smaller multiple p-dimensional cubes. In addition, we propose an efficient method for precomputing the cube, which takes into account the constraints imposed by the given metarule.

Reference-contexts: We examine two cube-based algorithms for this case: (1) multi-D-slicing, which finds large 1-predicate sets and uses them to perform multi-dimensional slicing on the data cube. This algorithm adopts the spirit of table-based approaches to association rule mining <ref> (such as Apriori of Agrawal & Srikant 1994) </ref> as well as our earlier table-based study on metarule-guided mining (Fu & Han 1995), although here a data cube structure is used; and (2) n-D cube search, which directly examines the p-D cells of the precomputed n-D cube in order to find large <p> If L k1 is not empty (step 3), step 4 uses L k1 to derive the candidate k-predicate sets by intersecting the dimension vectors in L k1 , based on the principle of Apriori i.e., every subset of a large itemset must be large <ref> (Agrawal & Srikant 1994) </ref>. The counts of the candidates in k-space are examined in order to find L k . Search continues until L p is found (since L p predicate sets are needed to generate rules complying with a metarule having p predicates).

Reference-contexts: With recent progress on data warehousing and OLAP technology <ref> (Chaudhuri & Dayal 1997) </ref>, it is expected that many mining tasks will be performed on data warehouses. With efficient techniques developed for computing data cubes (Harinarayan et al. 1996; Agarwal et al. 1996; Zhao et al. 1997), it is important to explore data cube-based rule mining algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Previous studies on data mining with metarules include (Klemettinen et al. 1994) which uses metarules as filters defining the form of interesting association rules; (Shen et al. 1996) which uses metarules to guide the mining of Bayesian data clustering rules; and <ref> (Fu & Han 1995) </ref> which uses a relation table-based structure for metarule-guided mining. With recent progress on data warehousing and OLAP technology (Chaudhuri & Dayal 1997), it is expected that many mining tasks will be performed on data warehouses. <p> Example 1 Suppose a user wishes to mine a set of strong rules in a university database, associating the students' gpa with their major, student id, birth place, and residence. The task can be expressed in a data mining query language, DMQL <ref> (Han & Fu 1995) </ref>, as follows. mine multi-dimensional association rules from student in relevance to major, student id, birth place, residence set template P (s : student; x) ^ Q (s; y) ) gpa (s; z): with min support = 0.20, min confidence = 0.80 First, the task-relevant data is extracted, <p> This algorithm adopts the spirit of table-based approaches to association rule mining (such as Apriori of Agrawal & Srikant 1994) as well as our earlier table-based study on metarule-guided mining <ref> (Fu & Han 1995) </ref>, although here a data cube structure is used; and (2) n-D cube search, which directly examines the p-D cells of the precomputed n-D cube in order to find large p-predicate sets, L p . <p> Since each chunk is partitioned according to dimension hierarchies, a chunk forms a semantically meaningful entity and its computation is equivalent to computing an interesting, meaningful subcube which may facilitate mining of multiple-level rules <ref> (Han & Fu 1995) </ref>. Each chunk and its summary layers are small enough to fit in main memory. One scan of a chunk derives all of its summary layers, and these layers are sufficient for computing the summary layers of the entire cube.

Reference-contexts: This is especially beneficial for metarule-guided mining since only a few cube layers (i.e., p and m) need to be computed. Performance Study Based on our performance study <ref> (Kamber et al. 1997) </ref>, we recommend the n-D cube search algorithm when the data cube is available. Regardless of the number of generalized tuples, n-D cube search must examine the same number of cells (i.e., the p-D layer) in order to find L p .

Reference-contexts: The 0-D space consists of one sum cell which stores the total number of counts (or generalized tuples) represented in the cube. A 3-D data cube is shown in Fig. 1. For sparse cubes, sparse matrix technology <ref> (Zhao et al. 1997) </ref> can be applied. <p> If the layer is larger than the available main memory, it can be partitioned into chunks <ref> (Zhao et al. 1997) </ref> and only the corresponding chunks need be loaded for efficient computation. Rationale. Step 1 finds the large 1-predicate sets for each dimension A i by searching the 1-D space of the cube. A candidate predicate set is a potentially large predicate set. <p> An efficient, array-based algorithm for simultaneous multidimensional aggregation has been studied recently <ref> (Zhao et al. 1997) </ref>. At any given time, at least one chunk is loaded into memory. The data cells of the chunk are scanned, and the corresponding summary layers of the data cube are updated. <p> However, the ordering in which summary layers are computed can be explored, e.g., by computing some summary layers simultaneously if there is sufficient memory. Therefore, this hierarchy-based chunking and prior computation of chunk summary layers is an interesting alternative to <ref> (Zhao et al. 1997) </ref> for cube computation. This is especially beneficial for metarule-guided mining since only a few cube layers (i.e., p and m) need to be computed.
