Reference-contexts: SCHR ODER shape of Flatlets with two vanishing moments). Another set of wavelets explored for WR was introduced by Alpert <ref> [2] </ref> under the name multi-wavelets. Over each interval a set of Legendre polynomials up to some order M 1 is used and a wavelet hierarchy is imposed. Here too, neighboring intervals decouple giving multi-wavelets the tree property as well (see Figure VI.7 for a multi-wavelet with two vanishing moments). <p> This program of using the wavelet representations for the efficient numerical treatment of operators was initiated in [15]. We also refer to <ref> [3, 2] </ref> for related material and many more details. 3.2 Differential equations In a different direction, because of the close similarities between the scaling function and finite elements, it seems natural to try wavelets where traditionally finite element methods are used, e.g. for solving boundary value problems [108].

Reference-contexts: The BRDF gives the relation at y between incoming radiance from x and outgoing radiance towards z.

Reference-contexts: A typical test problem here is Burgers' equation: @u + u @x @ 2 u The time discretization is obtained here using standard schemes such as Crank-Nicholson or Adams-Moulton. Wavelets are used in the space discretization. Adaptivity can be used both in time and space <ref> [10] </ref>. One of the nice features of wavelets and finite elements is that they allow us to treat a large class of operators or partial differential equations in a unified way, allowing for example general PDE solvers to be designed.

Reference-contexts: In a least squares paradigm, given a current curve or surface, the modeling tool returns the curve or surface that meets the constraints by changing the current control points by the least squares amount <ref> [12, 86] </ref>. The behavior of the modeling tool is determined by the type of control points and basis functions used to describe the curve or surface. With the uniform cubic B-spline basis, for example, the user's actions result in local changes at a predetermined scale. <p> Two related methods are described; direct control point manipulation and a least squares solver. In control point modeling, the user is allowed to directly alter the coefficient values, by clicking and dragging on control points. In the least squares scheme <ref> [12, 86] </ref>, the user can click and drag directly on the curve or surface, defining interpolation and tangent constraints, linear with respect to the control points. The system returns the curve or surface that satisfies these linear constraints, by changing the coefficients by the least squares amount.

Reference-contexts: This is often referred to as the standard realization of the integral operator <ref> [15] </ref>. The pyramid algorithms that were mentioned earlier for transforming a function of a single variable between a basis of V L and the bases in V 0 + P L1 i=0 W i can be applied to matrices (functions of two variables). <p> This representation of T as the matrix A T is often referred to as the standard representation of T <ref> [15] </ref>. There is also a nonstandard representation. <p> This program of using the wavelet representations for the efficient numerical treatment of operators was initiated in <ref> [15] </ref>. <p> There are interesting results showing that this might be fruitful; for example, it has been shown <ref> [15, 45] </ref> that for many problems the condition number of the N fi N stiffness matrix remains bounded as the dimension N goes to infinity. This is in contrast with the situation for regular finite elements where the condition number in general tends to infinity.

Reference-contexts: In this case the filter coefficients for PushPull are still just simple area ratios. Piecewise polynomial triangular elements could be accommodated as well in a straightforward extension of the use of multi-wavelets in [94]. The feasibility of this approach was recently examined by Bouatouch and Pattanaik <ref> [16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This approach is similar to the one described by Finkelstein and Salesin [76]. In these notes we will discuss some of the various issues that are relevant to building such a modeling tool. Variational modeling is a third general paradigm for geometric modeling <ref> [21, 194, 147] </ref>. In this setting, a user alters a curve or surface by directly manipulation, as above, defining a set of constraints. The variational modeling paradigm seeks the best solution amongst all answers that meet the constraints. <p> There are a variety of objective functions used in geometric modeling [147, 160] In our implementation we have used the thin-plate measure which is based on minimizing the parametric second derivatives <ref> [187, 21, 194] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In order to remove the k 2 dependence the hierarchy of interactions must be extended upward. A number of such clustering algorithms have recently appeared in the literature <ref> [163, 173, 172, 22] </ref>. The main difficulty with clustering in the context of radiosity is due to visibility. For example, the light emitted by a cluster of elements is not equal to the sum of the individual emissions.

Reference-contexts: The particular wavelet construction used in this work are derived in <ref> [26] </ref>, and were chosen because of the semi-orthogonality of the basis, the associated ' is a cubic B-spline (i.e., C 2 ), and the wavelet function is symmetric with compact support. 1.3.2 Wavelets on the Interval In a classical wavelet construction, the domain goes from 1 : : : 1. <p> Traditionally <ref> [26] </ref> the wavelet functions are defined with the following scaling: 1 In this case, non-zero can be defined to be having an absolute value greater than some epsilon without incurring significant error in the representation.

Reference-contexts: One good compromise between these two extremes (subsampling, and orthogonal projection), is to use the filter sequence given for the non-orthogonal wavelet construction by Cohen et al. <ref> [34] </ref>. This projection in non-orthogonal, but it is entirely local. This is the choice we have used in our multiresolution modeling tool. When one projects a curve or surface to a lower resolution, the detail may be lost.

Reference-contexts: Cohen, Zicheng Liu, Steven J. Gortler) These course notes are excerpted from Hierarchical Spacetime Control, by Zicheng Liu, Steven J. Gortler, and Michael F. Cohen, SIGGRAPH, 1994. 1.1 Introduction The spacetime constraint method, proposed in 1988 by Witkin and Kass [195], and extended by Cohen <ref> [37] </ref>, has been shown to be a useful technique for creating physically based and goal directed motion of linked figures. The basic idea of this approach can be illustrated with a three-link arm and a ball (see Figure VII.1). <p> Unfortunately, general solutions to such a non-linear optimization problem are also unknown. Based on this observation, Cohen developed an interactive spacetime control system using hybrid symbolic and numeric processing techniques <ref> [37] </ref>. In this system, the user can interact with the iterative numerical optimization and can guide the optimization process to converge to an acceptable solution. One can also focus attention on subsets or windows in spacetime. <p> This procedure quickly approximates the optimal trajectory and smoothly converges to a final answer with sufficient detail in those regions that require it. An important feature of the system discussed in <ref> [37] </ref> is also available in the current implementation. The user can directly modify the current solution with a simple key frame system to help guide the numerical process.

Reference-contexts: Because the wavelet system (6/7) is hierarchical it will not suffer from the poor conditioning of the B-spline system of Equation (5). For a rigorous discussion of the relevant theory see <ref> [46] </ref>. The scaling of the basis functions is very significant for the behavior of the optimizing procedures. Tra ditionally the wavelet functions are defined with the scaling defined in [135, 154]. <p> At each level moving up, the basis functions become twice as wide, and are scaled 1 p 2 times as tall. While in many contexts this normalizing may be desirable, for optimization purposes it is counter productive. For the optimization procedure to be well conditioned <ref> [109, 46] </ref> it is essential to emphasize the coarser levels. The correct theoretical scaling depends on both the energy function used, and the dimension of problem. For a fuller discussion, see the Appendix in [95]. In the experiments described below a different scaling was used.

Reference-contexts: In this scheme, the subdivision scheme proceeds by using information not only from the boundaries, but from neighbours across it, and the distribution information is spread in a non-Markovian fashion. It is interesting to note that it is quite close to the quincunx subdivision scheme <ref> [50] </ref> used for two-dimensional wavelet transforms. For many applications it is important to realize a true stochastic interpolation, that is a constraint is not to modify the points already computed at later stages of subdivision. <p> The rate of apparition of new results and applications is astounding.

Reference-contexts: In general the differences are limited to more indices to manipulate, or in the case of a program, more array dimensions to iterate over. 2 Galerkin Methods Galerkin methods are a class of algorithms designed to solve integral equations of a particular kind <ref> [54] </ref>.

Historically radiosity algorithms were derived from power balance arguments [91, 150] and only recently [103] was the traditional mathematical framework brought to bear on the radiosity problem. However, all previous algorithms can be analyzed in the framework of the weighted residual method. <p> To see why this is, we use the fact that a Galerkin method using a piecewise polynomial basis of order M 1 will have an accuracy of O (h M ) 3 . Where h gives the sidelength of the elements in the mesh <ref> [54, 116] </ref>. To make this concrete, suppose we are willing to allow an error proportional to 1=256. Using piecewise constant basis functions, h would have to be on the order of 1=256 to meet our goal. Now consider piecewise linear functions.

Reference-contexts: Wavelet methods in conjunction with B-splines provide a method for constructing a useful geometric modeling interface. This approach is similar to the one described by Finkelstein and Salesin <ref> [76] </ref>. In these notes we will discuss some of the various issues that are relevant to building such a modeling tool. Variational modeling is a third general paradigm for geometric modeling [21, 194, 147]. <p> The orthogonal projection is the object in the lower resolution space that is closest to object in the higher resolution space using the L 2 measure. In general, this involves a sort of low-pass filtering. This is the approach used in <ref> [76] </ref>. Although this is a very elegant way of obtaining a lower resolution version of an object, it has a few drawbacks. The particular filter sequence used is infinite in length (although it does decay rapidly from its centers) and so performing this task efficiently can be troublesome.

The central result, showed in <ref> [78] </ref> is that 1. The time sequence of detail coefficients at the same level d j (i) and d j (k) is self-similar and stationary; the covariance of the coefficients properly scaled is a unique function of (k i). 2. <p> When H takes different values, the situation becomes more complex, and the interested reader should consult <ref> [78] </ref> for details. When considering wavelets other than Haar, it turns out that the crucial factor is the number of vanishing moments N (see chapter II for a definition of N ).

Reference-contexts: This finite representation transforms the variational problem into a constrained non-linear optimization problem. An unconstrained problem can then be derived by penalizing violations to the constraints. A quasi-Newton method, BFGS <ref> [79] </ref>, is used to solve the resulting non-linear problem. Iterations begin with a user provided initial guess of wavelet coefficients (that can be derived from B-spline coefficients) and a guess of the inverse of the Hessian (usually an identity matrix leading to the first iteration being a simple gradient descent).

Reference-contexts: This is not fully desirable; at times the user may want to make fine changes of detail, while at other times he may want to easily make broad changes. Hierarchical B-splines offer a representation that allows both control point and least squares editing to be done at multiple resolutions <ref> [80] </ref>. Hierarchical B-splines, though, form an over-representation for curves and surface (i.e., any curve has multiple representations using hierarchical B-splines). As a result, the same curve may behave differently to a user depending on the particular underlying representation.

Reference-contexts: Over the next many iterations, the solution process will affect wider and wider regions, and the effect will spread out slowly like a wave moving along a string. The result is very slow convergence (see Figure (VII.4)). One method used to combat this problem is multigridding <ref> [186, 81] </ref>, where a sequence of problems at different resolution levels are posed and solved. An alternative approach, is to use a wavelet basis instead of a standard finite element basis [182, 158, 109, 154]. In a wavelet basis, the answer is represented hierarchically.

Reference-contexts: In a least squares paradigm, given a current curve or surface, the modeling tool returns the curve or surface that meets the constraints by changing the current control points by the least squares amount <ref> [12, 86] </ref>. The behavior of the modeling tool is determined by the type of control points and basis functions used to describe the curve or surface. With the uniform cubic B-spline basis, for example, the user's actions result in local changes at a predetermined scale. <p> Two related methods are described; direct control point manipulation and a least squares solver. In control point modeling, the user is allowed to directly alter the coefficient values, by clicking and dragging on control points. In the least squares scheme <ref> [12, 86] </ref>, the user can click and drag directly on the curve or surface, defining interpolation and tangent constraints, linear with respect to the control points. The system returns the curve or surface that satisfies these linear constraints, by changing the coefficients by the least squares amount. <p> The system returns the curve or surface that satisfies these linear constraints, by changing the coefficients by the least squares amount. Least square solutions can be found very inexpensively using the pseudoinverse <ref> [86] </ref>. The least squared problem can also be posed as a minimization problem [194], whose solution can be found by solving a sparse, well conditioned, linear system.

Reference-contexts: This is similar to the problem we discussed with wavelets on an interval, and, indeed, the techniques discussed there can be often used to handle these two problems [4, 9]. Wavelets have also been used in the solution of evolution equations <ref> [90, 129] </ref>. A typical test problem here is Burgers' equation: @u + u @x @ 2 u The time discretization is obtained here using standard schemes such as Crank-Nicholson or Adams-Moulton. Wavelets are used in the space discretization. Adaptivity can be used both in time and space [10].

Reference-contexts: The reason the Haar basis allowed us to do this simplification lies in the fact that the scaling functions in the Haar system do not overlap. For more general wavelets there is overlap between neighboring functions. Consequently the above substitution, while still possible <ref> [92] </ref>, is not as straightforward. The problem arises with overlapping basis functions because some regions may be accounted for multiple times, in effect introducing the same power more than once into the system.

Reference-contexts: Thus, only those basis functions with resulting coefficients greater than some * will have a significant influence on the curve and the rest can be ignored. In other words, given an oracle function <ref> [97, 93] </ref>, that can predict which coefficients will be above a threshold, only the corresponding subset of wavelets needs to be included. Solutions to the non-linear spacetime problem, involve a series of quadratic subproblems for which the computational complexity depends on the number of unknown coefficients.

(Adapted from [166].) in the lower left, the P i GQ i block in the upper left and the Q i GP i block in the lower right. <p> One step in the transform is shown. (Adapted from <ref> [94] </ref>.) individual transforms. First all rows are split into high pass and low pass bands (a single level application of the two scale relation), then all columns are subjected to a single level transform. Now recurse on the low pass/low pass quadrant P i GP i (see Figure VI.5). <p> This type of oracle was employed in the case of wavelet radiosity <ref> [94, 166] </ref> and estimates the quantity j b G Gj directly. 4.3.6 Iterative Solvers As pointed out earlier there are two parts to a complete algorithm, setting up the equations, and solving them. <p> In other words the coefficients are bounded by a power Siggraph '95 Course Notes: #26 Wavelets WAVELET RADIOSITY: WAVELET METHODS FOR INTEGRAL EQUATIONS 175 Figure VI.6: The F 2 wavelet construction. F 2 bases have two different wavelet functions. Both of them have two vanishing moments (from <ref> [94] </ref>).

Both of them have two vanishing moments (from <ref> [94] </ref>). Figure VI.7: The M 2 wavelet construction whose scaling functions are the first two Legendre polynomials. Both of the wavelet functions (lower right) have two vanishing moments (from [94]). of a size (interval or area) to distance (jx yj) ratio. The same argument we used earlier in the context of radiosity, except this time made on purely mathematical grounds with no reference to the surrounding geometry. <p> One issue remains. The abstract theory of integral operators has us use the scaling and wavelet functions to construct the sparse linear system. WR <ref> [94] </ref> (or higher order hierarchical methods) only use the scaling functions. Consider again the Haar example. Suppose we are using the Haar basis for a non-standard realization of our operator (see Figure VI.4 left column). <p> The problem arises with overlapping basis functions because some regions may be accounted for multiple times, in effect introducing the same power more than once into the system. The wavelets that were used in the original WR work <ref> [94, 166] </ref> did not suffer from this problem because they were tree wavelets. In a tree wavelet the filter sequences do not overlap. The Haar basis is a tree wavelet basis. <p> Here too, neighboring intervals decouple giving multi-wavelets the tree property as well (see Figure VI.7 for a multi-wavelet with two vanishing moments). Details regarding these functions in the context of WR can be found in <ref> [94, 166] </ref>. Using tree wavelets and the substitution of all wavelet functions by sequences of scaling functions leads to an obvious simplification of the code and follows naturally from the historical development. <p> If only one of these has vanishing moments, say the primal basis, it is desirable to use a projection into the dual basis on the left hand side of the original operator, P V GP V . This was the case in <ref> [94, 166] </ref> for the so called Flatlets. Doing this requires a basis change back to the primal basis after each iteration of the operator. <p> We hypothesize that the total number of coefficients will have a component which is in some sense proportional to the length of the discontinuity. In practice two basic approaches have emerged to address the discontinuities in the kernel function. HR [102] and WR <ref> [166, 94] </ref> use regular quadtree subdivision of quadrilaterals. Thus they in effect resolve the resulting features in the computed radiosity function by approximating them with successively smaller rectangles (see the left side of Figure VI.8). <p> Lischinski et al.[121] stayed within the HR, i.e., constant basis function, framework. In this case the filter coefficients for PushPull are still just simple area ratios. Piecewise polynomial triangular elements could be accommodated as well in a straightforward extension of the use of multi-wavelets in <ref> [94] </ref>. The feasibility of this approach was recently examined by Bouatouch and Pattanaik [16]. <p> The development of these arguments led to a WR algorithm which has been shown to perform exceedingly well in practice under many circumstances <ref> [102, 166, 94, 88, 184] </ref>. The original method [166, 94] used tree wavelets (multi-wavelets and Flatlets) which simplify many implementation issues and are a natural extension from the historical development out of HR. <p> The development of these arguments led to a WR algorithm which has been shown to perform exceedingly well in practice under many circumstances [102, 166, 94, 88, 184].

Reference-contexts: For the optimization procedure to be well conditioned [109, 46] it is essential to emphasize the coarser levels. The correct theoretical scaling depends on both the energy function used, and the dimension of problem. For a fuller discussion, see the Appendix in <ref> [95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These can be described as setting up the equations, i.e., computing the entries of the linear system, and solving the linear system. The latter typically invokes some iterative solution scheme, for example Jacobi or Gauss Seidel iteration [175], or Southwell relaxation <ref> [96] </ref>. In actual implementations these two phases are often intermixed, for example when refining a subdivision mesh (adding basis functions) during successive iterations. Nonetheless we can distinguish these two fundamental operations in our algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Thus, only those basis functions with resulting coefficients greater than some * will have a significant influence on the curve and the rest can be ignored. In other words, given an oracle function <ref> [97, 93] </ref>, that can predict which coefficients will be above a threshold, only the corresponding subset of wavelets needs to be included. Solutions to the non-linear spacetime problem, involve a series of quadratic subproblems for which the computational complexity depends on the number of unknown coefficients.

Reference-contexts: Since the roles of receivers and sources are reversible a two level hierarchy over each geometric primitive resulted. These ideas were developed further in a paper by Hanrahan et al.[102]. They introduced HR, which applied some arguments from the n-body literature <ref> [6, 98, 11] </ref> to CR. In their approach a possibly very deeply nested subdivision hierarchy was imposed on every primitive. Light transport was allowed to occur throughout these hierarchies. <p> Ironically the historical roots of HR lie in n-body algorithms <ref> [98] </ref>, which are all about clustering, not subdivision. This difference moves most clearly into focus when considering the complexity analysis we gave earlier. <p> Each cluster is treated as a point source (and receiver) whose behavior is characterized as a function of direction with a small number of discretized directions. In this way the resulting algorithm is more closely related to the multipole based algorithm of Greengard <ref> [98] </ref> rather than a wavelet method. All of the above clustering algorithms compute an approximation of the radiosity or radiance at such a coarse level that a final reconstruction step (also referred to as final gather) needs to be added to produce an acceptable looking final image.

Reference-contexts: Just as one can create a ladder of nested function spaces using uniform cubic B-splines of various resolutions, one can also create a nested ladder using non-uniform B-splines [128]. Subdivision surfaces are a powerful technique for describing surfaces with arbitrary topology <ref> [101] </ref>. A subdivision surface is defined by iteratively refining an input control mesh. As explained by Lounsbery et al. [124], one can develop a wavelet decomposition of such surfaces. Thus, many of the ideas developed above may be applicable to that representation as well.

Reference-contexts: It is interesting to note that the original Hierarchical Radiosity (HR) algorithm <ref> [102] </ref> (see below) already gave a proof of the O (n) complexity based purely on geometric arguments using a construction which does decouple the scales in a way very close to the Beylkin et al. argument. <p> Their algorithm unifies the benefits of higher order Galerkin Radiosity (GR) [103, 104, 199, 188] and HR <ref> [102] </ref>. HR was the first method to fully exploit a multilevel hierarchy to gain an asymptotic improvement in the efficiency of radiosity computations. It also corresponds directly to the use of a Haar wavelet basis for radiosity. <p> Siggraph '95 Course Notes: #26 Wavelets 170 P. SCHR ODER As mentioned earlier, the process of iterating and subdividing is not typically separated in a real implementation. For example, we could imagine that the predicate Acceptable takes into account the brightness of the sender (brightness refinement <ref> [102] </ref>) and maybe the importance of the receiver (importance refinement [174]) vis-a-vis some global error threshold *. The error threshold may itself become smaller upon successive iterations (multigridding [102]), creating a fast but inaccurate solution first and using it as the starting point for successive solutions with lesser error. <p> For example, we could imagine that the predicate Acceptable takes into account the brightness of the sender (brightness refinement <ref> [102] </ref>) and maybe the importance of the receiver (importance refinement [174]) vis-a-vis some global error threshold *. The error threshold may itself become smaller upon successive iterations (multigridding [102]), creating a fast but inaccurate solution first and using it as the starting point for successive solutions with lesser error. Any of these techniques we might refer to as refinement. Thus we will typically reexamine interactions created in an earlier iteration when iterating again. <p> that the simplest version (no brightness, importance, or multigridding refinements) of the function Acceptable is a comparison of error against ffi. 4.3.3 Bounding the Number of Interactions Suppose now that we stay in the framework of CR in so far that we only allow constant basis functions (as HR does <ref> [102] </ref>) and that we simply set b G = G (x 0 ; y 0 ) where x 0 and y 0 are the midpoints of the respective intervals (areas) we are considering. <p> This was the oracle used in the original HR algorithm <ref> [102] </ref>. For higher order methods a simple form factor estimate is sufficient to argue the asymptotic bounds, but does not take full advantage of the information present. <p> Once this has occurred we still need a function referred to as PushPull in <ref> [102] </ref>. For each input surface (element) i, ProjectKernel is called with all other input surfaces (elements) j. As pointed out above, the choice of interactions G ij actually created corresponds to an implicit choice of basis functions. <p> We hypothesize that the total number of coefficients will have a component which is in some sense proportional to the length of the discontinuity. In practice two basic approaches have emerged to address the discontinuities in the kernel function. HR <ref> [102] </ref> and WR [166, 94] use regular quadtree subdivision of quadrilaterals. Thus they in effect resolve the resulting features in the computed radiosity function by approximating them with successively smaller rectangles (see the left side of Figure VI.8). <p> The BRDF gives the relation at y between incoming radiance from x and outgoing radiance towards z. Aupperle and Hanrahan [8] were the first to give a hierarchical finite element algorithm for radiance computations. They extended their earlier work <ref> [102] </ref> in a straightforward manner by considering triple interactions from A x via A y towards A z (as opposed to the case of radiosity with interactions from A x towards A y ). <p> The development of these arguments led to a WR algorithm which has been shown to perform exceedingly well in practice under many circumstances <ref> [102, 166, 94, 88, 184] </ref>. The original method [166, 94] used tree wavelets (multi-wavelets and Flatlets) which simplify many implementation issues and are a natural extension from the historical development out of HR.

Reference-contexts: It is easy to loose sight of the essential ideas unless we limit ourselves to the 1D domain case. The 1D domain case corresponds to what is known as flatland radiosity <ref> [103] </ref>, i.e., the exchange of light between line segments in the plane. Aside from dimensionality there is no essential difference between the integral equations governing 3D or flatland radiosity. Where appropriate we will be explicit about the changes necessary to go to 2D domains. <p> Historically radiosity algorithms were derived from power balance arguments [91, 150] and only recently <ref> [103] </ref> was the traditional mathematical framework brought to bear on the radiosity problem. However, all previous algorithms can be analyzed in the framework of the weighted residual method. For example, Classical Radiosity (CR) [91, 150] can be analyzed as a finite element method using piecewise constant basis functions. <p> When writing this out as a matrix suitable for matrix/vector multiplies the matrices in Figure VI.4 result. 4 Wavelet Radiosity Wavelet Radiosity (WR) was first introduced by Gortler et al.[94] and Schr oder et al.[166].

It also corresponds directly to the use of a Haar wavelet basis for radiosity. <p> This latter extension was realized with the use of wavelets. Approaching the description of the final algorithm in this way also allows us to argue the correctness of the method with very direct geometric means. 4.1 Galerkin Radiosity GR, first introduced by Heckbert <ref> [103, 104] </ref> aims to increase the order of basis functions used in radiosity algorithms. In this context CR [91, 150] is seen to be a Galerkin method using piecewise constant functions.

Reference-contexts: also refer to [3, 2] for related material and many more details. 3.2 Differential equations In a different direction, because of the close similarities between the scaling function and finite elements, it seems natural to try wavelets where traditionally finite element methods are used, e.g. for solving boundary value problems <ref> [108] </ref>. There are interesting results showing that this might be fruitful; for example, it has been shown [15, 45] that for many problems the condition number of the N fi N stiffness matrix remains bounded as the dimension N goes to infinity.

Reference-contexts: The result is very slow convergence (see Figure (VII.4)). One method used to combat this problem is multigridding [186, 81], where a sequence of problems at different resolution levels are posed and solved. An alternative approach, is to use a wavelet basis instead of a standard finite element basis <ref> [182, 158, 109, 154] </ref>. In a wavelet basis, the answer is represented hierarchically. This allows the solution method to alter the answer at any desired resolution by altering the proper basis function, and thus the ill-conditioning is avoided. <p> At each level moving up, the basis functions become twice as wide, and are scaled 1 p 2 times as tall. While in many contexts this normalizing may be desirable, for optimization purposes it is counter productive. For the optimization procedure to be well conditioned <ref> [109, 46] </ref> it is essential to emphasize the coarser levels. The correct theoretical scaling depends on both the energy function used, and the dimension of problem. For a fuller discussion, see the Appendix in [95]. In the experiments described below a different scaling was used.

Reference-contexts: Radiosity is governed by an integral equation which arises from a more general integral equation known as the rendering equation <ref> [115] </ref> when one assumes that all reflection occurs isotropically. Solving the underlying integral equation exactly is not possible in general. Thus numerical approximations must be employed leading to algorithms which are generally very expensive.

Reference-contexts: Subdivision surfaces are a powerful technique for describing surfaces with arbitrary topology [101]. A subdivision surface is defined by iteratively refining an input control mesh. As explained by Lounsbery et al. <ref> [124] </ref>, one can develop a wavelet decomposition of such surfaces. Thus, many of the ideas developed above may be applicable to that representation as well. Acknowledgements We are grateful to James H.

Reference-contexts: Piecewise polynomial triangular elements could be accommodated as well in a straightforward extension of the use of multi-wavelets in [94]. The feasibility of this approach was recently examined by Bouatouch and Pattanaik [16]. Classical wavelets however, have only recently been adapted to irregular meshes <ref> [126, 168] </ref> and they have not yet been applied to wavelet radiosity algorithms with explicit (or implicit) discontinuity meshing. 5.3 Radiance The basic ideas behind HR and WR can also be applied to the computation of radiance, i.e., global illumination in the presence of reflection which is no longer uniform with

Reference-contexts: Many of these concepts can be extended beyond the realm of tensor product uniform B-splines. Just as one can create a ladder of nested function spaces using uniform cubic B-splines of various resolutions, one can also create a nested ladder using non-uniform B-splines <ref> [128] </ref>. Subdivision surfaces are a powerful technique for describing surfaces with arbitrary topology [101]. A subdivision surface is defined by iteratively refining an input control mesh. As explained by Lounsbery et al. [124], one can develop a wavelet decomposition of such surfaces.

Reference-contexts: This is similar to the problem we discussed with wavelets on an interval, and, indeed, the techniques discussed there can be often used to handle these two problems [4, 9]. Wavelets have also been used in the solution of evolution equations <ref> [90, 129] </ref>. A typical test problem here is Burgers' equation: @u + u @x @ 2 u The time discretization is obtained here using standard schemes such as Crank-Nicholson or Adams-Moulton. Wavelets are used in the space discretization. Adaptivity can be used both in time and space [10].

Reference-contexts: For a rigorous discussion of the relevant theory see [46]. The scaling of the basis functions is very significant for the behavior of the optimizing procedures. Tra ditionally the wavelet functions are defined with the scaling defined in <ref> [135, 154] </ref>. At each level moving up, the basis functions become twice as wide, and are scaled 1 p 2 times as tall. While in many contexts this normalizing may be desirable, for optimization purposes it is counter productive.

Reference-contexts: Depending on the modalities of implementation, one can obtain varying level of details through a multi-grid approach, and true interpolation by sacrificing some of data-fitting aspect of the method. To go back to stochastic interpolation proper, a paper by Miller <ref> [144] </ref> proposes a solution which can be interpreted as smoothing over the already generated values with a small filter. 5.4 Generalized Stochastic Subdivision The most comprehensive answer to the problem of stochastic interpolation is generalized stochastic subdivision by J. Lewis [120].

Reference-contexts: In the case of radiosity with constant basis functions, measuring the ratio is particularly simple since it is given by the point to finite area form factor, a quantity for whose computation many formulas are known (see for example [171] or <ref> [146] </ref>). This was the oracle used in the original HR algorithm [102]. For higher order methods a simple form factor estimate is sufficient to argue the asymptotic bounds, but does not take full advantage of the information present.

Reference-contexts: This approach is similar to the one described by Finkelstein and Salesin [76]. In these notes we will discuss some of the various issues that are relevant to building such a modeling tool. Variational modeling is a third general paradigm for geometric modeling <ref> [21, 194, 147] </ref>. In this setting, a user alters a curve or surface by directly manipulation, as above, defining a set of constraints. The variational modeling paradigm seeks the best solution amongst all answers that meet the constraints. <p> The variational problem leads to a non-linear optimization problem over a finite set of variables when cast into a given basis. There are a variety of objective functions used in geometric modeling <ref> [147, 160] </ref> In our implementation we have used the thin-plate measure which is based on minimizing the parametric second derivatives [187, 21, 194]. <p> It has shown how wavelets can be used to obtain multiresolution control point and least squares control. It has shown how wavelets can be used to solve variational problems more efficiently. Future work will be required to explore the use of higher order functionals like those given in <ref> [147, 160] </ref>. Because the optimization problems resulting from those functionals are non-linear, they are much more computationally expensive, and it is even more important to find efficient methods. It is also important to study optimization modeling methods where constraint changes only have local effects.

Methods recently proposed by Voss [153], Saupe [153] and Musgrave, Kolb and Mace <ref> [148] </ref> do not respect that constraint, while trying to be more flexible or more faithful to the process simulated (generally fBm).

Reference-contexts: For cubic bases the refinement of an existing interaction into 4 child interactions results in 3 256 additional floating point coupling coefficients. Preliminary experiments with classical wavelets for radiosity have recently been reported by Pattanaik and Bouatouch <ref> [152] </ref>. They used Coiflets [52] as well as interpolating scaling functions [63]. However, they ignored issues associated with the boundary of patches, the singularity, and only gave an algorithm which does uniform refinement when the error criterion is not met (resulting in an O (n 2 ) algorithm).

Reference-contexts: In order to remove the k 2 dependence the hierarchy of interactions must be extended upward. A number of such clustering algorithms have recently appeared in the literature <ref> [163, 173, 172, 22] </ref>. The main difficulty with clustering in the context of radiosity is due to visibility. For example, the light emitted by a cluster of elements is not equal to the sum of the individual emissions.

SCHR ODER Figure VI.2: Two simple environments in flatland, two parallel line segments (left), and two perpendicular line segments (right), and the resulting matrix of couplings using piecewise constant functions. (Adapted from <ref> [166] </ref>.) Since wavelets can be used as bases for function spaces it makes sense to consider them in the context of a Galerkin method to solve an integral equation. <p> The bottom row shows the same bases applied to the form factor matrix for two perpendicular lines segments. (Adapted from <ref> [166] </ref>.) 3.2 Vanishing Moments We begin with the definition of vanishing moments. <p> This so called non-standard construction is also the basis of later wavelet radiosity work <ref> [94, 166] </ref>. We will describe this construction next. 3.4 Non-Standard Basis We saw earlier how the decomposition P L = P 0 + P L1 i=0 Q i applied to P L GP L on both sides resulted in a realization of G in the wavelet basis. <p> The top row shows the coupling matrix for two parallel line segments expressed in the Haar basis (top left) and in the F 2 basis [94] (top right). The bottom row shows the same bases applied to the coupling matrix for two perpendicular line segments. (Adapted from <ref> [166] </ref>.) in the lower left, the P i GQ i block in the upper left and the Q i GP i block in the lower right. The empty quadrant would have corresponded to P i GP i , however this is the block that the recursion (telescoping sum) occurs on. <p> This type of oracle was employed in the case of wavelet radiosity <ref> [94, 166] </ref> and estimates the quantity j b G Gj directly. 4.3.6 Iterative Solvers As pointed out earlier there are two parts to a complete algorithm, setting up the equations, and solving them. <p> The problem arises with overlapping basis functions because some regions may be accounted for multiple times, in effect introducing the same power more than once into the system. The wavelets that were used in the original WR work <ref> [94, 166] </ref> did not suffer from this problem because they were tree wavelets. In a tree wavelet the filter sequences do not overlap. The Haar basis is a tree wavelet basis. <p> Here too, neighboring intervals decouple giving multi-wavelets the tree property as well (see Figure VI.7 for a multi-wavelet with two vanishing moments). Details regarding these functions in the context of WR can be found in <ref> [94, 166] </ref>. Using tree wavelets and the substitution of all wavelet functions by sequences of scaling functions leads to an obvious simplification of the code and follows naturally from the historical development. <p> If only one of these has vanishing moments, say the primal basis, it is desirable to use a projection into the dual basis on the left hand side of the original operator, P V GP V .

Doing this requires a basis change back to the primal basis after each iteration of the operator. <p> We hypothesize that the total number of coefficients will have a component which is in some sense proportional to the length of the discontinuity. In practice two basic approaches have emerged to address the discontinuities in the kernel function. HR [102] and WR <ref> [166, 94] </ref> use regular quadtree subdivision of quadrilaterals. Thus they in effect resolve the resulting features in the computed radiosity function by approximating them with successively smaller rectangles (see the left side of Figure VI.8). <p> The development of these arguments led to a WR algorithm which has been shown to perform exceedingly well in practice under many circumstances <ref> [102, 166, 94, 88, 184] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the case of radiosity with constant basis functions, measuring the ratio is particularly simple since it is given by the point to finite area form factor, a quantity for whose computation many formulas are known (see for example <ref> [171] </ref> or [146]). This was the oracle used in the original HR algorithm [102]. For higher order methods a simple form factor estimate is sufficient to argue the asymptotic bounds, but does not take full advantage of the information present.

Reference-contexts: SCHR ODER As mentioned earlier, the process of iterating and subdividing is not typically separated in a real implementation. For example, we could imagine that the predicate Acceptable takes into account the brightness of the sender (brightness refinement [102]) and maybe the importance of the receiver (importance refinement <ref> [174] </ref>) vis-a-vis some global error threshold *. The error threshold may itself become smaller upon successive iterations (multigridding [102]), creating a fast but inaccurate solution first and using it as the starting point for successive solutions with lesser error. Any of these techniques we might refer to as refinement.

In actual implementations these two phases are often intermixed, for example when refining a subdivision mesh (adding basis functions) during successive iterations. Nonetheless we can distinguish these two fundamental operations in our algorithms.

Reference-contexts: This approach is similar to the one described by Finkelstein and Salesin [76]. In these notes we will discuss some of the various issues that are relevant to building such a modeling tool. Variational modeling is a third general paradigm for geometric modeling <ref> [21, 194, 147] </ref>. In this setting, a user alters a curve or surface by directly manipulation, as above, defining a set of constraints. The variational modeling paradigm seeks the best solution amongst all answers that meet the constraints. <p> In order to successfully choose a proper density, one must know how much detail exists in the variational minimum answer. Since, a priori, this is unknown, an efficient solver must be able to adaptively change the basis during the solution process <ref> [194] </ref>, one needs an easy way to detect that too many or too few basis functions are being used. In addition, one needs a basis for which adding more detail, (i.e., refinement), is easy. Wavelets offer a basis where this task can be accomplished quickly and elegantly. <p> The system returns the curve or surface that satisfies these linear constraints, by changing the coefficients by the least squares amount. Least square solutions can be found very inexpensively using the pseudoinverse [86]. The least squared problem can also be posed as a minimization problem <ref> [194] </ref>, whose solution can be found by solving a sparse, well conditioned, linear system.

The basic idea of this approach can be illustrated with a three-link arm and a ball (see Figure VII.1). <p> The final few iterations involved more wavelets inserted by the oracle to complete the process.

Cohen enhanced this work by demonstrating how to focus the optimization step on windows of spacetime and methodologies to keep the user in the optimization loop.

HR was the first method to fully exploit a multilevel hierarchy to gain an asymptotic improvement in the efficiency of radiosity computations. It also corresponds directly to the use of a Haar wavelet basis for radiosity. <p> In particular using higher order basis functions allows the use of much coarser meshes than CR required while still meeting a requested error bound. In his original work Heckbert applied these ideas in a flatland environment using piecewise linear basis functions. More recently Troutman and Max [188] and Zatz <ref> [199] </ref> have applied higher order basis functions to the computation of 3D radiosity. Zatz in particular has pushed the ideas to their extreme by leaving many surfaces unmeshed.
