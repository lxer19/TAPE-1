Reference-contexts: Introduction The Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the University of Texas at Austin has acquired two mobile robots for research purposes, specifically for research in mobile robot exploration, mapping and navigation using the Spatial Semantic Hierarchy representation of spatial knowledge <ref> [Kuipers and Levitt, 1988] </ref> [Lee, 1994]. One of the mobile robot is developed locally which we named Rover, while the other is a commercial mobile robot from Real World Interface TM (RWI) which we named Spot (see Figure 1.1). There are two operation guides which accompany the commercial RWI robot.

Reference-contexts: Downloading of the server program needs to be done only once. Given this, significant time can be saved by avoiding the typical long edit-compile-link-convert-load cycles of preparing and running cross-compiled C programs. Reader is referred to document <ref> [Lee, 1995a] </ref> for the details on the use of this package. A C library of serial communication related functions described in Chapter 4 is available 1 The complete control program resides and runs on Spot CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 4 for host (Sun) client programs development.

Reference-contexts: A comprehensive C library of functions related to Spot's sonar and effector systems is available for functional programming of Spot. Functions in this library are described in Chapter 3.2. Another cross-compilation library provides a multi-threading environment for Spot. This library, UTREX, is described in detail in another document <ref> [Lee, 1995b] </ref>. A sample program in Chapter 2.2.4 briefly introduces multi-threading programming using this library. <p> This section introduces the use of the multi-threading library UTREX. There are several C functions for thread creation and control, semaphores, IO, etc. The multi-threading library is described in detail in the document <ref> [Lee, 1995b] </ref>. Please refer to the previous section on propctrl program for a description on the working of the proportional control. 2 Actually they are declared in the file rwibase.h but that file is included in the file base.h.
