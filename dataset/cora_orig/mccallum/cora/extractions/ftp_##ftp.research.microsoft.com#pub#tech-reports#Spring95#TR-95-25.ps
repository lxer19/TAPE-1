Reference-contexts: In a least squares paradigm, given a current curve or surface, the modeling tool returns the curve or surface that meets the constraints by changing the current control points by the least squares amount <ref> [1, 11] </ref>. The behavior of the modeling tool is determined by the type of control points and basis functions used to describe the curve or surface. With the uniform cubic B-spline basis, for example, the user's actions result in local changes at a predetermined scale. <p> Two related methods are described; direct control point manipulation and a least squares solver. In control point modeling, the user is allowed to directly alter the coefficient values, by clicking and dragging on control points. In the least squares scheme <ref> [1, 11] </ref>, the user can click and drag directly on the curve or surface, defining interpolation and tangent constraints. The system returns the curve or surface that satisfies these linear constraints (Ax = b), by changing the coefficients by the least squares amount.

Reference-contexts: On each coarser level, the space V i has half as many basis functions, and they are all twice as wide. According to the well known B-spline knot insertion algorithm <ref> [6, 9, 3] </ref> one can define double width B-spline basis functions as linear combinations of single width B-spline basis functions. i1;j = k where the sequence h is h [0::4] = f 8 4 ; 8 4 ; 8 (see Figure (2)). <p> Equation (15) projects the high resolution curve from V i into the lower resolution space V i1 ; this is, in some sense, a smoother approximation of the object 3 A different sequence is given by Chui <ref> [3] </ref> and generates a semi-orthogonal wavelet. h to construct the double width B-spline L1;0 g to construct the wavelet function L1;0 in V i .

The uniform tensor product cubic B-spline basis is made up of the functions L;j (s) L;k (t) The hierarchical uniform tensor product cubic B-spline representation is made up of the functions i;j (s) i;k (t) for 0 i L. <p> It is easy to see that manipulating wavelet basis functions does not produce an intuitive interface.

When wavelet coefficients are manipulated, the curve responds in a wave like fashion. When the normal, tangent, bi-normal, (N; T; B) frame is used with a wavelet representation, the detail does not maintain its structure as the sweep is changed. <p> The orthogonal projection is the object in V L1 that is closest to object in V L using the L 2 measure. One may obtain the orthogonal projection by using Equation (15), with the h sequence given for the semi-orthogonal wavelet construction by Chui <ref> [3] </ref>. This is the approach used in [8]. Although this is a very elegant way of obtaining a lower resolution version of an object, it has a few drawbacks.

Reference-contexts: There is some degree of freedom in choosing the sequence g, as long as the property expressed by Equation (10) holds. One such sequence given by Cohen et al. <ref> [5] </ref> is (see Figure (3)). g [0::10] =f 256 20 ; 256 96 ; 256 280 ; 256 96 1 ; 256 5 g Due to the relationships of Equations (7) and (12), if some function X (t) in V i has been expressed as a linear combination of the B-spline <p> Equation (16) captures the detail that is lost in this projection, and represents it using a basis for the space W i1 .

This is the choice we have used in our multiresolution modeling tool. 4.2.3 Representing Detail What set of basis functions should be used to represent the detail.

Reference-contexts: Because the wavelet system (21/22) is hierarchical it will not suffer from the poor conditioning of the B-spline system of Equation (20). For a rigorous discussion of the relevant theory see <ref> [7] </ref>. The scaling of the basis functions is very significant for the behavior of the optimizing procedures. <p> While in many contexts this normalizing may be desirable, for optimization purposes it is counter productive. For the optimization procedure to be well conditioned <ref> [15, 7] </ref> it is essential to emphasize the coarser levels. The correct theoretical scaling depends on both the energy function used, and the dimension of problem. For a fuller discussion, see the Appendix in [13].

Reference-contexts: Wavelet methods in conjunction with hierarchical B-splines provide a method for constructing a useful geometric modeling interface. This approach is similar to the one described by Finkelstein and Salesin <ref> [8] </ref>. In this paper we will discuss some of the various issues that are relevant to building such a modeling tool.

This is the approach used in <ref> [8] </ref>. Although this is a very elegant way of obtaining a lower resolution version of an object, it has a few drawbacks. This particular h sequence is infinite in length (although it does decay rapidly from its centers) and so performing this task efficiently can be troublesome.

Reference-contexts: This is not fully desirable; at times the user may want to make fine changes of detail, while at other times he may want to easily make broad changes. Hierarchical B-splines offer a representation that allows both control point and least squares editing to be done at multiple resolutions <ref> [9] </ref>. Hierarchical B-splines, though, form an over-representation for curves and surface (i.e., any curve has multiple representations using hierarchical B-splines). As a result, the same curve may behave differently to a user depending on the particular underlying representation. <p> In wavelet terminology, the space (or family) of curves spanned by all linear combinations of these basis functions is denoted V L (e.g., V L contains all functions that are piecewise cubic, with simple knots at the integers). 3.1 Hierarchical B-splines Forsey and Bartels <ref> [9] </ref> introduced hierarchical B-splines as a way of representing and modeling geometric objects hierarchically. Instead of using only B-spline basis functions at a single resolution L, they use a hierarchy of wider and wider B-spline functions i;j (t) = (2 t j) (6) for 0 i L. <p> On each coarser level, the space V i has half as many basis functions, and they are all twice as wide. According to the well known B-spline knot insertion algorithm <ref> [6, 9, 3] </ref> one can define double width B-spline basis functions as linear combinations of single width B-spline basis functions. i1;j = k where the sequence h is h [0::4] = f 8 4 ; 8 4 ; 8 (see Figure (2)). <p> This is not always desirable, since the user may want the detail's orientation to follow the changing direction of broader curve or surface. An orientation approach first proposed by Forsey and Bar-tels <ref> [9] </ref> may be applied to the multiresolution editing scheme. In a multiresolution modeling system all of the information describing the curve or surface lives at some resolution. In an orientation approach, the information at each resolution i is not expressed as three independent functions of (X; Y; Z). <p> If the geometric object is being designed with a multiresolution editor, then the user is explicitly manipulating the object at resolutions that he chooses. Therefore, one simple method is to maintain all information at the resolution entered by the user <ref> [9] </ref>. Using this method, the same geometric object may behave differently depending on the way the object was generated. An alternative is to use wavelet analysis: begin with the complete resolution object (in V L ), and then successively project it to each lower resolution level using Equation (15).

Reference-contexts: Over the next many iterations, the solution process will affect wider and wider regions, and the effect will spread out slowly like a wave moving along a string. The result is very slow convergence (see Figure (1)). One method used to combat this problem is multigridding <ref> [26, 10] </ref>, where a sequence of problems at different resolution levels are posed and solved. An alternative approach, is to use a wavelet basis instead of a standard finite element basis [25, 23, 15, 22]. In a wavelet basis, the answer is represented hierarchically.

Least square solutions can be found very inexpensively using the pseudoinverse <ref> [11] </ref>. The least squared problem can also be posed as a minimization problem [28], whose solution can be found by solving a sparse, well conditioned, linear system.

Reference-contexts: Just as one can create a ladder of nested function spaces V i satisfying the property of Equation (10) using uniform cubic B-splines of various resolutions, one can also create a nested ladder using non-uniform B-splines [18].

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the linear systems arising from a finite element formulation are often expensive to solve using iterative methods.

One method used to combat this problem is multigridding [26, 10], where a sequence of problems at different resolution levels are posed and solved.

Reference-contexts: Given a set of n basis functions, the goal of finding the best curve or surface is then reduced to that of finding the best set of n coefficients. This reduction is referred to as the finite element method <ref> [27] </ref>. The general case requires solving a non-linear optimization problem. In the best case, the energy function is quadratic and the constraints are linear leading to a single linear system to solve. <p> There are a variety of objective functions used in geometric modeling [21, 24] In our implementation we have used the thin-plate measure which is based on parametric second derivatives <ref> [27, 2, 28] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This approach is similar to the one described by Finkelstein and Salesin [8]. In this paper we will discuss some of the various issues that are relevant to building such a modeling tool. Variational modeling is a third general paradigm for geometric modeling <ref> [2, 28, 21] </ref>. In this setting, a user alters a curve or surface by directly manipulation, as above, defining a set of constraints. The variational modeling paradigm seeks the best solution amongst all answers that meet the constraints. <p> In order to successfully choose a proper density, one must know how much detail exists in the variational minimum answer. Since, a priori, this is unknown, an efficient solver must be able to adaptively change the basis during the solution process <ref> [28] </ref>, one needs an easy way to detect that too many or too few basis functions are being used. In addition, one needs a basis for which adding more detail, (i.e., refinement), is easy. Wavelets offer a basis where this task can be accomplished quickly and elegantly. <p> The system returns the curve or surface that satisfies these linear constraints (Ax = b), by changing the coefficients by the least squares amount. Least square solutions can be found very inexpensively using the pseudoinverse [11]. The least squared problem can also be posed as a minimization problem <ref> [28] </ref>, whose solution can be found by solving a sparse, well conditioned, linear system. In multiresolution versions of these two schemes, the user chooses the resolution level i, and then only the quantities of basis functions on level i are altered. <p> There are a variety of objective functions used in geometric modeling [21, 24] In our implementation we have used the thin-plate measure which is based on parametric second derivatives <ref> [27, 2, 28] </ref>. <p> There are a variety of objective functions used in geometric modeling [21, 24] In our implementation we have used the thin-plate measure which is based on parametric second derivatives [27, 2, 28].
