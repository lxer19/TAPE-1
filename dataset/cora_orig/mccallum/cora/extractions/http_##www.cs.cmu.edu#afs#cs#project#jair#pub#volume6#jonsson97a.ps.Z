Abstract: We investigate the computational properties of the spatial algebra RCC-5 which is a restricted version of the RCC framework for spatial reasoning. The satisfiability problem for RCC-5 is known to be NP-complete but not much is known about its approximately four billion subclasses. We provide a complete classification of satisfiability for all these subclasses into polynomial and NP-complete respectively. In the process, we identify all maximal tractable subalgebras which are four in total.

Proof: RSAT (R 9 5 ) is polynomial by the previous two lemmata.

Reference-contexts: Bennett's approach uses classical propositional logic for RCC-5 and intuitionistic propositional logic for RCC-8. Unfortunately, these logics are known to be computationally hard. The satisfiability problem for classical propositional logic and intuitionistic propositional logic is NP-complete <ref> (Cook, 1971) </ref> and Pspace-complete (Statman, 1979) respectively. However, the complexity of the underlying logic does not carry over in both cases; Renz and Nebel (1997) have shown that the satisfiability problem for both RCC-5 and RCC-8 is NP-complete. The full proofs can be found in (Renz, 1996).

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Qualitative spatial reasoning has received a constantly increasing amount of interest in the literature. The main reason for this is, probably, that spatial reasoning has proved to be applicable to real-world problems in, for example, geographical database systems (Egenhofer, 1991; Grigni, Papadias, & Papadimitriou, 1995) and molecular biology <ref> (Cui, 1994) </ref>. In both these applications, the size of the problem instances can be huge, so the complexity of problems and algorithms is a highly relevant area to study. <p> This is especially true in spatial reasoning where the size of the problem instances can be extremely large; one good example is spatial reasoning in connection with the Human Genome project <ref> (Cui, 1994) </ref>. Another advantage with complete classifications is that they are more satisfactory from a scientific point of view; to gain a clear picture of the borderline between tractability and intractability has an intrinsic scientific value.

Reference-contexts: However, we will denote these algebras as spatial algebras in order to avoid terminological confusion; the term topological algebra has a well-established but completely different meaning in mathematics <ref> (Mallios, 1986) </ref>. Bennett (1994) has shown the sufficiency of using propositional logics for reasoning about RCC-5 and RCC-8. Hence, the reasoning becomes more efficient when compared to reasoning in a full first-order logic. Bennett's approach uses classical propositional logic for RCC-5 and intuitionistic propositional logic for RCC-8.
