Abstract: Technical Report 435 Department of Computer Science University of Rochester Abstract This paper presents a computational model of how conversational participants collaborate in order to make a referring action successful. The model is based on the view of language as goal-directed behavior. We propose that the content of a referring expression can be accounted for by the planning paradigm. Not only does this approach allow the processes of building referring expressions and identifying their referents to be captured by plan construction and plan inference, it also allows us to account for how participants clarify a referring expression by using meta-actions that reason about and manipulate the plan derivation that corresponds to the referring expression. To account for how clarification goals arise and how inferred clarification plans affect the agent, we propose that the agents are in a certain state of mind, and that this state includes an intention to achieve the goal of referring and a plan that the agents are currently considering. It is this mental state that sanctions the adoption of goals and the acceptance of inferred plans, and so acts as a link between understanding and generation.

Reference-contexts: This is different from what Grosz and Sidner (1990) have called master-servant dialogues, which occur in teacher-apprentice or information-seeking dialogues, in which one of the participants is controlling the conversation (cf. Walker and Whittaker, 1990). Note that the non-controlling agent may be helpful by anticipating obstacles in the plan <ref> (Allen and Perrault, 1980) </ref>, but this is not the same as collaborating. The mutual responsibility that the agents share not only concerns the goal they are trying to achieve, but also the plan that they are currently considering.

Reference-contexts: terminating instance of modifiers, the plan constructor builds an instance of postpone-plan, which it names p26. (The schema was given in Figure 10.) Rather than realizing the surface speech action immediately, the system plans ahead. (This would allow an opportunistic process to combine surface speech actions into a single utterance <ref> (Appelt, 1985) </ref>.) So, the system, presupposing that the user understands the system's plan, adds the following belief. bmb (user,system,plan (system,p26,bel (user,bel (system,error (p1,p22))))) (17) It also adds the belief that this plan will achieve its goal. bel (system,achieve (p26,bel (user,bel (system,error (p1,p22))))) (18) Then by rule (1), the system adds the

Reference-contexts: We, however, use a single current plan, modifying it as clarifications are made. This difference has an important ramification, for it results in different interpretations of the discourse structure. Consider dialogue (7.1), which was collected at an information booth in a Toronto train station <ref> (Horrigan, 1977) </ref>. (Although the participants are not collaborating in making a referring expression, the dialogue will serve to illustrate our point.) (7.1) P: 1 The 8:50 to Montreal? C: 2 8:50 to Montreal. Gate 7. P: 3 Where is it? C: 4 Down this way to your left.
