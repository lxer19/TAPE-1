Title: A Review of CAS Mathematical Capabilities

Abstract: Computer algebra systems (CASs) have become an important computational tool in the last decade. General purpose CASs, which are designed to solve a wide variety of problems, have gained special prominence. In this paper, the capabilities of seven major general purpose CASs (Axiom, Derive, Macsyma, Maple, Mathematica, MuPAD and Reduce) are reviewed on 131 short problems covering a broad range of (primarily) symbolic mathematics. A demo was developed for each CAS, run and the results evaluated. Problems were graded in terms of whether it was easy or difficult or possible to produce an answer and if an answer was produced, whether it was correct. It is the author's hope that this review will encourage the development of a comprehensive CAS test suite. Presented below is a summary of 131 mathematical problems (primarily symbolic) that were given to the seven general purpose computer algebra systems (CASs) listed in Table 1. The CAS versions tested were those that were available to the author and were typically the newest and most comprehensive versions that were generally available at the time of this evaluation. The notations used in the summary are explained in Table 2. A demo was developed for each CAS, run and the results evaluated. Problems easily and successfully solved are marked by a *. Those that required more effort than a mere `simplify' (sometimes considerably more effort) or the results could not be completely simplified or were incomplete in some way are marked with an ffi. If the problem could not be solved by the CAS, the corresponding entry in the summary table was left blank. Incorrect answers are indicated by an fi. Problem descriptions are abbreviated due to space limitations with this format and may not always be complete. However, the complete demos and their output are readily obtained by anonymous FTP from math.unm.edu. The directory pub/cas will contain current versions of these and other potentially interesting CAS related files. fl Earlier versions of this paper have appeared in [Wes94, Wes95].
