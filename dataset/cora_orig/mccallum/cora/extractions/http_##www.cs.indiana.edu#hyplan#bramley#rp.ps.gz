Abstract: Row projection (RP) methods are a class of algorithms for solving general linear systems. The defining characteristic of RP methods is that the matrix is partitioned into block rows, and then orthogonal projections onto the null space of the block rows are computed. Unlike most Krylov subpsace and Lanczos based methods, they are robust in theory, converging for any nonsingular system. However, three major problems still prevent their common use: computing the required orthogonal projections can be expensive for some matrix partitionings, preconditioning the RP system is difficult, and practical methods for partitioning the matrix are unknown except in special cases. This paper presents a new class of RP methods which address all three of those problems, while still converging for any nonsingular system.

Reference-contexts: For m = 3 block rows, this means each matrix-vector product in the CG-accelerated RP method requires 10 solves with M 1 or M T , clearly an impractical approach. Arioli and Duff <ref> [1] </ref> proposed using right preconditioning with a diagonal matrix D.

Reference-contexts: RP methods date back at least to the 1930's; see [3] for some of the more important bibliographic references. The basic ideas until now have all been based on the methods originally proposed by S. Kaczmarz [7] and G. Cimmino [6]. A. Bjorck and T. Elfving <ref> [2] </ref> proposed using CG acceleration of the basic RP schemes, and C. Kamath and A. Sameh [9] first proposed and developed methods that allow parallelism in the block tridiagonal case. They also examined various methods of computing the projections for the Kaczmarz scheme. R. Bramley and A. <p> Because of the slow convergence of this iteration, Bjorck and Elfving <ref> [2] </ref> proposed symmetrizing the iteration by following a forward sweep through the rows with a backward sweep.

Reference-contexts: This in turn is because RP methods require finding the orthogonal projection of vectors onto the null space of block rows of the matrix, which for practical problems requires accessing the actual entries in the matrix. RP methods date back at least to the 1930's; see <ref> [3] </ref> for some of the more important bibliographic references.

Reference-contexts: Elfving [2] proposed using CG acceleration of the basic RP schemes, and C. Kamath and A. Sameh [9] first proposed and developed methods that allow parallelism in the block tridiagonal case. They also examined various methods of computing the projections for the Kaczmarz scheme. R. Bramley and A. Sameh <ref> [4] </ref> provided a detailed analysis of the effects of different row partitionings for the seven point difference operator, and a theoretical comparison with CG on the normal equations. <p> Note that each CG iteration will require 2m 1 orthogonal projections to be computed. It is possible to reduce this number to 2m 2, by starting with the initial estimate x 0 in a certain affine set; see <ref> [4] </ref> for details. 1.2. The Cimmino Row Projection Method. The second basic RP method can be derived as a preconditioner for the CG algorithm. <p> More generally, the Cimmino spectrum is less suitable for conjugate gradient acceleration, as was shown in <ref> [4] </ref>. 2 2. Problems with RP Methods. Because the Cimmino spectrum is generally less favorable for CG acceleration than the Kaczmarz spectrum, in the remainder of this paper we concentrate on the product form of RP algorithms. <p> The methods tested were the partial row projection (PRP) method with no preconditioning (NoPC), ILU (0), and ILU (2) preconditioners. These were compared with the original CG-accelerated Kaczmarz method (KACZ) using both the modified domain decomposition (DD) method described earlier, and with the original RP-9 partitioning <ref> [4] </ref>. That partitioning is only defined for quasi-uniform mesh problems and so results are not shown for problem CFD with it. The stopping test was kr k k &lt; 10 6 kr 0 k, where r k = b Ax k .

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, 2m 2 projections are needed for each outer CG iteration and the total number of inner CG iterations tends to grow exponentially with problem size and accuracy. All practical approachs to date solve the subsystems by performing a QR factorization <ref> [8] </ref> of A i or by performing a Cholesky factorization of A T i A i (the normal equations method).
