Title: A Method for Resolving the Consistency Problem Between Rule Based and Quantitative Knowledge using Fuzzy Simulation  
Author: Gyooseok Kim, Paul A. Fishwick 
Affiliation: Computer Information Science and Engineering Department University of Florida  
Abstract: Given a physical system, there are experts who have knowledge about how this system operates. In some cases, there exists quantitative knowledge in the form of deep models for the identical system. One of the main issues dealing with these different types of knowledge is "how does one address the difference between the two model types, each of which represents a different level of knowledge about the system?" We have devised a method that starts with 1) the expert's knowledge about the system, and 2) a quantitative model that can represent all or some of the behavior of the system. This method then adjusts the knowledge in either the rule-based system or the quantitative system to achieve some degree of consistency between the two representations. Through checking and resolving the inconsistencies, we provide a way to obtain better models in general about systems by exploiting knowledge at all levels, whether qualitative or quantitative.

While the first two kinds of fuzzy simulation are useful when there is not enough information to simulate quantitatively, the third kind takes linguistic information from the expert and performs computer simulation quantitatively on continuous and discrete event models. <p> Rules or FSA (Finite State Automata) can be extracted from these quantitative models through linguistic mappings, and these results can be validated directly against the expert domain knowledge.

Reference-contexts: We provide benefits to expert systems from simulation and benefits to simulation modeling from expert knowledge <ref> [7, 6, 8, 13, 16, 3, 20, 21] </ref>. In particular, when expert system researchers are studying the acquisition of deep knowledge from an expert or validating the expert's knowledge against quantitatively compiled knowledge, the first type of benefits can be obtained from simulation models [7, 6, 8, 13, 16]. <p> The advantage from the reverse direction is also obtained when simulation model validations are performed during the simulation modeling process with the aid of the expert knowledge <ref> [13, 3, 20, 21] </ref>. Searching for the appropriate fuzzy membership functions that adequately capture the meaning of the linguistic terms employed in a particular application belongs to the general problem area of knowledge acquisition within the underlying framework of fuzzy set theory [10]. <p> To make this point more understandable, we consider the general modeling process depicted in Fig 19 <ref> [20, 21, 4] </ref>. The conceptual model represents the mathematical, logical or verbal representation of the problem entity developed for a particular study, and the computerized model represents the conceptual model implemented on a computer. <p> One of the primary validation techniques used for this evaluation is face validation <ref> [21] </ref>. Face validation involves having domain experts evaluate the conceptual model to determine if they believe it is correct and reasonable for its purpose. This usually means examing the flowchart or graphical model, or the set of model equations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Given a physical system, knowledge about the system is often obtained from experts in the form of rules. Although the rule-based model is occasionally associative or shallow in nature, this model can easily capture human heuristic and problem solving knowledge in an efficient way <ref> [2, 11, 22] </ref>. In some cases, there exists a quantitative model which represents all or part of the behaviors of the physical system. This model provides deeper and more theoretical knowledge when expert system developers want to find solutions for technical problems [11, 7, 22]. <p> In some cases, there exists a quantitative model which represents all or part of the behaviors of the physical system. This model provides deeper and more theoretical knowledge when expert system developers want to find solutions for technical problems <ref> [11, 7, 22] </ref>. Assuming the above two different model types for the identical system, some important questions can arise: how much do the models differ? and how can one resolve the inconsistencies?.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, in order to get a compressed and generalized set of fuzzy rules, additional methods such as fuzzy induction or fuzzy system identification methods <ref> [15, 24, 17, 23] </ref> should be adopted. Consequently, forming the above knowledge acquisition cycle to employ fuzzy set concepts requires a series of difficult tasks. Our research is concerned with devising a method for resolving the inconsistency between two different levels of knowledge in efficient and systematic manner.
