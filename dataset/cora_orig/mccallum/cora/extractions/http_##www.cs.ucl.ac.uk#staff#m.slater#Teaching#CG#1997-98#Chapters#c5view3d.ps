Abstract: We perceive the visual world in three-dimensions. Representations of this world are often two-dimensional: drawings, paintings, TV and movies. Sculpture provides an example of material 3D representations. It is only relatively recently that virtual (but stationary) 3D representations have become possible through holograms - the theoretical work for this was first done in the 1950s. Even more recently 3D dynamic images have been generated, using the technology of socalled Virtual Reality (VR) - the first head-mounted display was invented in 1968, and these have become part of the computer scene in the past five years. VR can deliver an illusion to the participant of being in an extended 3D space. This is achieved by an optical system that presents a slightly different image to each eye, which the human visual system fuses into a single image in depth (this is called stereopsis). A head-mounted display achieves this by focusing the images from LCD screens one in front of each eye, each showing a view appropriate to that eye. Moreover, the HMD is tracked, so that head moves result in corresponding image changes. For many years there have also been systems that show stereo views on an ordinary display, for example, by utilising special shutter glasses, which in synchrony with the display show the left image only to the left eye, and the right image only to the right eye. Provided that this occurs fast enough, the human visual system fuses the two images into one. Throughout, of course, we assume that the two views, for left and right eyes, have been appropriately computed. We return to this problem in XXX. Human beings have represented the world in 2D since prehistoric times; everyone knows about cave paintings. However, on this immense historical scale, it is only comparatively recently that we have understood the principles behind correct 2D representations of 3D scenes. (It can be validly argued that there is no such thing as a correct representation, but we will leave this issue for discussion). This was discovered in the Renaissance period. The problem is: given a 3D object, how can it be represented on a 2D plane? The answer arrived at by artists and mathematicians is in the notion of a projection . A projection is a way of associating each point in 3D space with a unique point in the 2D space in which the representation is to appear. Note that this is always a one-to-many mapping, that is one point in the 2D space will typically represent an infinite number of possible points in the 3D space. A 2D surface onto which the projection is to be made. We will call this the view plane. We also need the equivalent of a Camera, that is some way of determining how the 3D scene is to be viewed - from which position, looking in which direction, and so on. Y Consider parallel projection first. We introduce this by way of an example. (You should do the following yourself to help understand it).
