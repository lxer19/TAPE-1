Abstract: Maps of regional morbidity and mortality rates are useful tools in determining spatial patterns of disease. Combined with socio-demographic census information, they also permit assessment of environmental justice, i.e., whether certain subgroups suffer disproportionately from certain diseases or other adverse effects of harmful environmental exposures. Bayes and empirical Bayes methods have proven useful in smoothing crude maps of disease risk, eliminating the instability of estimates in low-population areas while maintaining geographic resolution. In this paper we extend existing hierarchical spatial models to account for temporal effects and spatio-temporal interactions. Fitting the resulting highly-parametrized models requires careful implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, as well as novel techniques for model evaluation and selection. We illustrate our approach using a dataset of county-specific lung cancer rates in the state of Ohio during the period 1968-1988.

Reference-contexts: Under external standardizing a product Poisson likelihood arises, while under internal standardizing the joint distribution of the y i`t is multinomial. However, since likelihood inference is unaffected by whether or not we condition on P i`t y i`t <ref> (see e.g. Agresti, 1990, p 455-56) </ref>, it is common practice to retain the product Poisson likelihood. The interesting aspect in the modeling involves the prior specification for i`t , or equivalently for i`t log i`t . Models for i`t can incorporate a variety of main effect and interaction terms.

Reference-contexts: We concern ourselves primarily with modeling associations between components (2) and (3). Other work focuses on associations between components (1) and (2) <ref> (e.g., Anderton et al, 1994) </ref>, and between components (1) and (3) (e.g., bioassay). A full assessment of environmental justice will require a melding of developments from each of these three areas. The data associated with the three components of environmental justice often are available in different formats.

Reference-contexts: In particular, if p fl is an overall disease rate then i`t = p i`t =p fl and E i`t = n i`t p fl . The 's are said to be externally standardized if p fl is obtained from another data source, such as a standard reference table <ref> (see e.g. Bernardinelli and Montomoli, 1992) </ref>. The 's are said to be internally standardized if p fl is obtained from the given dataset, e.g., if p fl = i`t y i`t = i`t n i`t .

Reference-contexts: Customary model choice procedures are not applicable. For example, Bayes factors are not interpretable with flat priors on fi (and perhaps the ffi t ), and with CAR priors for the spatial 11 effects. Cross-validatory predictive selection schemes <ref> (Gelfand, Dey and Chang, 1992) </ref> are are also unavailable, again due to the presence of heterogeneity and clustering model parameters individually identified only by the prior. In any case, neither of these two options is feasible here, given the high dimensionality of our models. Penalized likelihood criteria (e.g.

Reference-contexts: Updating parameters in multivariate blocks (Liu, Wong, and Kong, 1994) is one way to account for these correlations; another is through elementary transformations <ref> (Gelfand, Sahu, and Car 14 lin, 1995) </ref>. The latter approach is particularly useful here, and is motivated by the fact that the likelihood by itself cannot inform about the spatial heterogeneity and clustering parameters individually, but only their sum.

Reference-contexts: The Gibbs sampler <ref> (Gelfand and Smith, 1990) </ref> is not well-suited to this problem, however, because, with the exception of the t and t t , no full conditional distributions for the model parameters are standard.

Reference-contexts: We began with a purely univariate version of this algorithm, wherein associated with each parameter was a univariate normal candidate density centered at the current value of this parameter and having some variance 2 , chosen to provide a Metropolis acceptance ratio between 25 and 50% <ref> (see Gelman et al., 1996) </ref>. This collection of univariate Metropolis and Gibbs updating steps converges fairly slowly no surprise in view of the between-parameter posterior correlations we would expect in our model.

Reference-contexts: We then add a flat hyperprior for but require a proper hyperprior (typically a gamma distribution) for t . Formally, with a usual improper prior such as t (d3)=2 ; d = 0; 1; 2, the resultant joint posterior need not be proper <ref> (Hobert and Casella, 1996) </ref>. Pragmatically, an informative prior for t insures well behaved Markov chain Monte Carlo model fitting; see Section 4 for further discussion. Note that the inclusion of heterogeneity effects yields association amongst the y's across regions.

Reference-contexts: Environmental justice is becoming an important part of the federal environmental regulatory process and plays a role in the setting of priorities for federal intervention. The United States Environmental Protection Agency established the Office of Environmental Equity in November of 1992 <ref> (Sexton, Olden and Johnson 1993) </ref>. In February 1994, President Clinton signed the Environmental Justice Executive Order which requires an assessment of environmental justice in regulation decisions made by every federal agency involved with environmental and public health.

Reference-contexts: The data associated with the three components of environmental justice often are available in different formats. Exposure data over large regions are obtained from either monitoring stations or reported releases such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Chemical Release Inventory <ref> (Stockwell et al. 1993) </ref>. Due to confidentiality concerns, disease incidence data 2 in the United States most often are available as summary counts or rates from geographic regions forming a partition of the study area. Census regions such as counties or census tracts are often used.

Reference-contexts: Sound statistical methodology for assessing environmental justice (or detecting environmental "injustices") is clearly needed, but has been slow to develop. The assessment of environmental justice is a complex problem with many interesting statistical components <ref> (Wagener and Williams 1993) </ref>. The three primary components of environmental justice are (1) exposure assessment at any location within a geographic region, (2) accurate estimation of socio-demographic variables across the same geographic region, and (3) disease (or other outcome of interest) incidence in small subregions of the same region.
