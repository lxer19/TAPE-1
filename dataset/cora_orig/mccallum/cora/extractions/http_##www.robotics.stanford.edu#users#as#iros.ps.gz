Abstract: In radiosurgery a moving beam of radiation is used as an ablative surgical instrument to destroy brain tumors. Classical radiosurgical systems rely on rigid skeletal fixation of the anatomic region to be treated. This fixation procedure is very painful for the patient and limits radiosur-gical procedures to brain lesions. Furthermore, due to the necessity of rigid fixation, radiosurgical treatment with classical systems cannot be fractionated. A new camera-guided system capable of tracking patient motion during treatment has been built to overcome these problems. The radiation source is moved by a six degree-of-freedom robotic arm. In addition to offering a more cost effective, less invasive, and less painful treatment, the robotic gantry allows for arbitrary spatial motion of the radiation source. Based on this feature we can treat non-spherical lesions with accuracies unachiev-able with classical radiosurgical systems. The system introduces a new class of radiosurgical procedures, called non-stereotactic, or image-guided radiosurgery. At the heart of these procedures are algorithms for planning both a treatment and the corresponding beam motion, given the geometric description of the tumor shape and relative locations in the particular case.

Reference-contexts: However, this radius is initially set between 5mm and 40mm by mounting a collimator (lead inset for beam focusation) to the radiation source. The new system offers the following advantages over earlier radiosurgical and radiotherapeutical systems (see e.g. <ref> [7, 9, 10] </ref>): * The tissue does not have to be fixed in space. In earlier radiosurgical systems this was done with stereotaxic frames. <p> A test series for the new system was carried out to evaluate the possibilities of generating prespecified dose distributions. In the test series, cases treated during a comparison period with an earlier system for frame-based stereotactic radiosurgery <ref> [7] </ref> were considered. In each case data for the actual treatment performed were retrieved. Plans for the same cases were then computed with our new planning system. The comparison is based on photographic film phantom studies in water, dose-volume histograms, as well as 2D and 3D dose visualization paradigms.

Reference-contexts: If p is a point and C i 1 ; : : :; C i k are the cylinders containing p, then D (p) = w i 1 + + w i k . (This definition provides a coarse model for photon beam characteristics. Refinements described in <ref> [12] </ref> allow for a more accurate representation of these characteristics.) We consider two disjoint regions T (for tumor) and H (for healthy tissue), with the following constraints: the dose delivered at each point in T must be larger than some value ff, while the dose at each point of H must <p> The comparison is based on photographic film phantom studies in water, dose-volume histograms, as well as 2D and 3D dose visualization paradigms. The results of the test series and variants of the above methods are discussed in <ref> [12] </ref>. An example is shown in figures 9 a-d and 10. Fig. 9-a 7 shows an axial cross-section of the brain for a 69 year old patient presenting a large non-spherical tumor of the falx cerebri, delineated in the cross-section. Fig. 9b shows the 3D reconstruction of the tumor outline.

Reference-contexts: The choice orientation of this polyhedron is problematic if there are critical healthy structures in the tumor vicinity. Furthermore there is no such regular polyhedron with more than 20 vertices. A more even distribution is obtained using more directions. The methods in <ref> [14] </ref> provide point grids on spheres which are adequate for our purposes. Our planning method thus uses a large set of beams (typically n 300) for a single sphere, and addresses the presence of critical regions not during the beam selection phase, but during the beam weighting phase. <p> A beam with rectangular cross-section avoids this problem. (figure 4 b). General Shapes: The above approach is restricted to the pseudo-cylindrical shapes shown in figure 3 and shapes obtained from bending such shapes. A direct generalization of this scheme is the following. With an algorithm in <ref> [14] </ref>, we compute a grid of n points on the tumor surface. Each such point is now treated as an isocenter. As above, a single beam is placed through each isocenter.
