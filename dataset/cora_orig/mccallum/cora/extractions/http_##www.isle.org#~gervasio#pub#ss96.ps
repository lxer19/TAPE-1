Abstract: The complexity of the real world makes a perfect characterization impossible. Purely deliberative approaches such as classical planning are thus susceptible to unexpected failures. Preventive learning approaches address the imperfect theory problem through the diagnosis of such failures and the determination of fixes to avoid similar failures in the future. Curative learning approaches such as completable planning instead treat failures as alternative outcomes and learn alternative plans to the recover from the failures. Through learning, a completable planner learns to plan only for the more likely outcomes in the particular problem distribution it faces. It thus significantly reduces the cost of disjunctive planning.. As a curative learning approach, it is also better suited to domains where outright failures are unacceptable or failure diagnosis is expensive, making preventive learning infeasible. Complet-able planning is a general incremental learning approach whose success in real world domains may be increased through the integration of other learning techniques and the consideration of different planning perspectives.

Reference-contexts: Completable Planning Completable planning is a curative learning approach to the problem of imperfect domain theories. Completable planning begins with the construction of a base plan, which is a completely ordered sequence of operators. The base plan may be constructed using any standard classical planner, including partial-order planners (e.g. <ref> [Chapman87, McAllester91, Pen-berthy92] </ref>). However, a permanent complete ordering must then be imposed. This is because different orderings may result in different sets of failures. Allowing arbitrary orderings would compromise the usefulness of any plans constructed in response to failures.

Reference-contexts: Preventive Learning While a perfect symbolic representation of a domain is unattainable, learning may enable real world planners with imperfect domain theories to construct plans with high probabilities of success. Previous learning approaches to the problem of imperfect domain theories have been preventive (e.g. <ref> [Ben-nett90, Chien94, DeJong93, Gil93, Mostow87] </ref>). These approaches rely failure diagnosis to explain the cause of any failures encountered during execution. Similar future failures can then be prevented by fixing the cause of failure-e.g. retracting a faulty assumption, adding a missing precondition, or changing acceptable parameter ranges.

Reference-contexts: The number of examples required to generate a solution is polynomial in 1 , fi 1 . The completable planning approach is thus an attractive, tractable learning approach to the problem of imperfect domain theories. Feasible Disjunctive Planning Disjunctive planning <ref> [Draper94, Peot92, Warren76] </ref> deals with the problem of incompletely specified preconditions by allowing actions to be characterized as having multiple possible outcomes. Goal achievement is then guaranteed by determining a contingency plan for each possible outcome of every action in a plan.

Reference-contexts: However, with multiple possible outcomes, planning in the forward direction is increased. Planning approaches to making disjunctive planning more feasible have included associating probabilities with the different outcomes and planning only for the most probable ones, as in <ref> [Drummond90] </ref>, and using control rules to avoiding useless search, as in [Genesereth93]. These approaches buy feasibility at the cost of an increased domain engineering burden. Completable planning increases the feasibility of the disjunctive planning approach in three ways.

First, the requirement of specifying all the possible outcomes of every action is eliminated. The burden on the knowledge engineer is thus reduced.

Reference-contexts: If a contingent plan is successfully constructed, the new segment is generalized and added into the base plan as a new alternative branch. Execution proceeds until either the goal is reached or contingent planning fails. <ref> [Gervasio94] </ref> elaborates on the information-gathering issues of completable planning. Completable planning employs a probably approximately correct (PAC) learning algorithm. A solution is defined with respect to ffi (minimum goal success rate), X (maximum execution length), and Y (maximum per episode planning cost).

Reference-contexts: But it is unlikely to result in the courier turning two corners, entering another room, and crashing through the window. The more well-behaved a domain, the better the performance of completable planning. Experiments with a variety of simulated domains, including robot navigation, a toolbox world <ref> [Krebsbach92] </ref>, and parts assembly confirm that average execution length becomes longer as the probability of expected outcomes decreases. A greater range of possible outcomes also increases the planning cost, associated with a plan schema. The learning cost is consequently increased as well.

Reference-contexts: Problems with Imperfect Theories The frame problem <ref> [McCarthy69] </ref> guarantees that it is impossible to completely consider all the factors possibly affecting the effects an action. For STRIPS-type operators, this incompleteness may be manifested in the form of an incomplete set of preconditions. This results in two types of execution failure.
