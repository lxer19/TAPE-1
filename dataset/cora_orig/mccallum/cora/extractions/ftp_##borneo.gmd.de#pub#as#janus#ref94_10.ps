Reference-contexts: Countless variants and refinements of such methods are currently in use. In contrast to such a centralized approach to the problem, we employ a decentralized model, based on the idea of teams of reflective agents <ref> [1] </ref>. To make decentralization possible the problem must be reformulated. We use several methods that act to decentralize the problem description. The constraints can be handled locally. Each type of constraint is considered to represent an independent force influencing the arm movement. <p> As output, the agents produce a suggestion for a configuration change ffi k for the respective control variable q k and a confidence value <ref> [9, 1] </ref> that (in this case) expresses the estimated importance of this change for the accomplishment of the overall agent task. c is normalized in [0 : : : 1], and may be interpreted as a likelihood that "something will go wrong" if ffi k is not executed.

Reference-contexts: Its inefficiency is reduced to a status of low import ance through the ensuing driver program learn process that takes place on a higher level. A central research topic is the concept of operation in an open environment <ref> [2, 8] </ref>), where constraints for arm movements are of a fluctuating nature. Therefore the inverse kinematics must be able to handle a large variety of intermittently occurring constraints. 2 The Inverse Kinematics Pro blem In this section we introduce a formal model to describe our algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Such behavior is biologically motivated <ref> [3] </ref>, and has the advantage of always keeping the control variables as far away as possible from the limits of their operating range. * For more complicated tasks an orientation force is necessary. It represents the wish to orient the "hand" of the manipulator to ena ble proper grabbing.

Reference-contexts: A decentralized solution which is based an partial autonomous agents is quite "natural". Biological systems include many decentralized activities on the motoric level and the current trend of this research field is towards autonomous agent systems <ref> [4, 6, 7] </ref>. The philosophy of our approach is similar to that of many researchers in the field of artificial life ([11]). In fact, there is a (small) likelihood of getting synergetic effects out of the system.

Reference-contexts: Such methods are often supported if not provided by the manipulator manufacturers. In such cases a derivation of the IDK is mathematically payable. There is an enormous literature concerned with such equation-based methods (the classic work is <ref> [5] </ref>). Countless variants and refinements of such methods are currently in use. In contrast to such a centralized approach to the problem, we employ a decentralized model, based on the idea of teams of reflective agents [1]. To make decentralization possible the problem must be reformulated.

Whether a particular constraint is valid depends on the current task environment, as do combinations of valid constraints. The IDK must be able to cope with such possibilities. JANUS is designed to operate in an open world <ref> [8] </ref> and therefore constraints may change frequently and be unpredictably triggered by external asynchronous instances, such as the experimenter himself. 3 Heuristic Approach To move the TCP from the point x s to x g the IDK has to be applied iteratively u times until the TCP reaches the goal.

Reference-contexts: A two arm robot should learn the motor knowledge necessary to perform simple pick and place operations in an environment where human interaction is allowed. The system is visually guided. The learning of motor control is based on the idea of driver programs <ref> [10] </ref>. In order to enable this kind of bootstrapped learning mechanism the system must already be able to "touch" points in the working space with the tool center point (TCP) of the manipulator arms. A minimal inverse kinematics is thus required. <p> In JANUS this is no problem, because the IDK is only used as a tool to support a higher process of driver program (DP) learning <ref> [10] </ref>. During this learning process the ripples are removed and the TCP path is stepwise smoothed (Figure 11). A force agent based approach cannot be applied if there is no additional process available for improving the smoothness of the arm movement.
