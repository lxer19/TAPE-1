Title: Reasoning with Contradictory Information using Quasi-classical Logic

Abstract: The proof theory of quasi-classical logic (QC logic) allows the derivation of non-trivializable classical inferences from inconsistent information. A non-trivializable, or paraconsistent, logic is, by necessity, a compromise, or weakening, of classical logic. The compromises on QC logic seem to be more appropriate than other paraconsistent logics for applications in computing. In particular, the connectives behave in a classical manner. Here we motivate the need for QC logic, present a proof theory, and semantics for the logic, and compare it to other paraconsistent logics.

Reference-contexts: These properties have been much discussed in the context of non-monotonic logics [Gab85, GM93] 18 and of relevance logics <ref> [AB75, Ten84] </ref>. At the end of this section, we discuss the relevance to QC logic of these properties and associated results. <p> In classical logic, the first paradox can hold because we can obtain ff _ fi from ff by disjunct introduction, and then fi by disjunctive syllogism. Recognizing this, Anderson and Belnap, who were keen to retain transitivity, suggested the rejection of disjunctive syllogism <ref> [AB75] </ref>. Later Tennant [Ten84] suggested the retention of disjunctive syllogism, and the rejection of transitivity. Tennant's paraconsistent logic is a restriction of the classical system of natural deduction: Classical proofs are restricted so as to prohibit applications of ex falso quodlibet.

Reference-contexts: However, cut, conditionalization, and deduction, also hold for C ! [Hun96b]. For both QC and C ! , supraclassi-cality, left logical equivalence, and right weakening fail. The four-valued logic of Belnap <ref> [Bel77] </ref> provides an interesting alternative to C ! in that it has an illuminating and intuitive semantic characterization to complement its proof theory. We just provide the proof theory here. Definition 6.2 The language for four-valued logic is a subset of classical logic.

Reference-contexts: However, to support some forms of non-classical reasoning, some compromise on these properties needs to be made. For non-monotonic reasoning | a form of reasoning with information that is in some sense inconsistent <ref> [BH97] </ref> | involves compromising on monotonicity [Gab85]. However, this compromise results in other properties also being compromised. There are many choices over which combinations of properties can be supported for non-monotonic reasoning [Mak94]. The properties of reflexivity and monotonicity hold for the QC consequence relation.

QC logic may also offer an interesting alternative to classical logic in non-monotonic reasoning. Consider default logic with a default theory (D; W ). Here the default rules in D are used to extend the classical reasoning from W under a proviso that the extension is consistent.
