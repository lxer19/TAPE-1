Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to QoS (Quality of Service) routing in a multimedia, multihop, wireless network. The wireless net can be either stand alone, or connected to the wired net. The main focus of the paper is the QoS routing procedure which can inform the source of the bandwidth and quality of service available to any destination in the wireless network. This knowledge enables the establishment of QoS connections within the wireless network and the efficient support of real time, multimedia traffic. In addition, it enables more effective call acceptance control. In the case of ATM interconnection, QoS information permits to extend the ATM virtual circuit service to the wireless network, with possible renegotiation of QoS parameters at the gateway. Simulation experiments show the efficiency of QoS routing in selected multihop, mobile radio network scenarios.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, most of the research has been directed to: (1) multimedia traffic integration within the wireless cell, and; (2) timely rerouting of backbone virtual circuits from one cell to next with minimal disruption of service <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. In addition to the traditional, cellular based applications, a number of new applications have emerged recently, which require wireless multihopping between remote users, without relying on the fixed, wired infrastructure. These applications include disaster (flood, fire, earthquake) recovery, search and rescue and ad hoc networking among nomadic users.

Reference-contexts: Key to the support of QoS reporting is QoS routing, which provides path QoS information at each source. Prior research efforts in multihop radio systems have not fully addressed this problem. For example, the ARPA supported Packet Radio project <ref> [8] </ref> has provided an efficient solution to datagram support, but has not adequately solved the support of real time traffic with Quality of Service. In this paper, we address the problem of supporting multimedia, multihop, mobile communications in a wireless environment using QoS routing. <p> We monitor total packet throughput versus offered traffic load as stations move at various speeds. In the first experiment, we measure the performance of the cluster TDMA architecture. Then, we repeat the experiment for the PR-NET, the Packet Radio Network developed under ARPA support in the 70's and 80's <ref> [8] </ref> 4.1.1 Cluster TDMA In this experiment, the TDM frame is 100ms (same as the routing update period), with 10 data slots per frame. Real time traffic is modeled by a continuous source which generates 1 packet per time frame. <p> Average packet delay is again comparable for the two schemes. The higher delay experienced by B-F can be attributed to the higher operating load. 4.1.2 PRNET The PRNET simulator is based on the protocols described in <ref> [8] </ref>. Since there is no notion of slot and frame in the PRNET, we chose the parameters carefully such that the channel capacity in both experiments is comparable.

Reference-contexts: selective packet dropping and input rate control, can be applied here. * Mobility: The inter-working of mobility and VC maintenance is a critical issue, especially when the wireless network interconnects to an wired backbone. 2.2 Proposed Approach A multihop, dynamically-reconfigured multi-cluster network for supporting multimedia traffic has been presented in <ref> [9] </ref>. Spread-Spectrum radios are utilized to permit code division multiple access (CDMA). The transmit power is controlled by a distributed power control algorithm DPC-ALP [10, 11] to reduce power interference and to increase channel capacity. The distributed clustering algorithm [9] partitions the multi-hop network into clusters (see Fig. 1). <p> dynamically-reconfigured multi-cluster network for supporting multimedia traffic has been presented in <ref> [9] </ref>.

The available bandwidth computation is carried out independently at each node and is piggybacked on the routing algorithm. In the cluster/TDMA architecture, routing is based on a loop-free, destination sequence distance vector (DSDV) scheme [17].

Reference-contexts: Within each cluster, the MAC (Medium Access Control) layer is implemented using a time slotted frame. Namely, the transmission time scale is organized in frames, each containing a fixed number of time slots. The entire network is synchronized on a frame and slot basis using an elastic synchronization scheme <ref> [12] </ref>. The frame is divided into two phases, namely, control phase and information phase. The control phase, see Fig. 2 supports the communications needs of all control functions, such as slot and frame synchronization, clustering, routing, power measurement and control code assignment, VC reservation, ACKs, etc.

Reference-contexts: If the slot remains unused for a certain number of frames, it is declared free by the cluster head and is returned to the free slot pool. This scheme, which was inspired by the PRMA protocol <ref> [13] </ref>, allows the VC stream to dynamically select a new path to the destination when the old path fails. Our solution is more akin to the soft state connection and flow ID concept proposed in RSVP [14].

Our solution is more akin to the soft state connection and flow ID concept proposed in RSVP <ref> [14] </ref>. Of course, each path change will cause some disruption (i.e., possible out of sequencing, delay to acquire a slot on the new path, lack of free slots, etc.).

Reference-contexts: However, the disruption is much less severe than if a new path had to be entirely reconstructed end to end each time. The disruption caused by rerouting is mitigated by exploiting the rate-adaptive, hierarchically encoded voice/video compression schemes presented in <ref> [15] </ref>. Namely, least significant packets within a hierarchically encoded video or voice stream are dropped during rerouting. This will alleviate congestion and reduce reservation delay if bandwidth on the new path is scarce, albeit at the expense of temporary signal quality degradation.

Reference-contexts: Usually, in a wireless network, the transmitter and receiver will not transmit and receive at the same time because they use the same frequency band. With this constraint, the computation of available bandwidth along a path is non-trivial. In fact, it is an NP-complete problem <ref> [16] </ref>. Let us illustrate this by an example. Referring to Fig. 3, let us consider the path (a; b; c; d) with free slot pools f2,3g,f1,2,3g,f1,2,5g on links ab, bc, cd, respectively. The numbers refer to the free data slot positions in the TDMA frame. <p> To resolve slot scheduling at the same time as available bandwidth is searched on the entire path is equivalent to solve the Satisfiability Problem (SAT) which is known to be NP-complete <ref> [16] </ref>. Fortunately, in the clustering infrastructure, the computation of available bandwidth is easier than for the general case. This is because the gateway nodes which connect neighboring clusters must switch to different codes in different time slots.

Reference-contexts: The available bandwidth computation is carried out independently at each node and is piggybacked on the routing algorithm. In the cluster/TDMA architecture, routing is based on a loop-free, destination sequence distance vector (DSDV) scheme <ref> [17] </ref>. As well known, a distance vector routing scheme, such as Bellman-Ford, is subject to looping and counting-to-infinite problems. DSDV provides loop-freedom while making minimum modifications to the B-F routing structure. DSDV works in the following way. <p> When a node receives a broadcast with an 1 metric, and it has a more recent sequence number to that destination, it triggers a route update broadcast to disseminate the important news about that destination. In <ref> [17] </ref>, the DSDV protocol is proven to guarantee loop-free paths to each destination at all instants. 4 Simulation Results QoS routing performance was evaluated using Maisie, a C based, parallel simulation language, developed at UCLA [18].

The simulated environment consists of 20 mobile stations randomly roaming in a 1000fi1000 feet square. Two mobiles can communicate with each other if their distance is within 500 feet.

Reference-contexts: In addition, duct routing is used, as described in <ref> [19] </ref>. Essentially, with duct routing multiple paths can be used to carry multiple copies of a real time packet, in order to improve reliability. Duct routing follows automatically from point (d) above, where alternate routes are used simultaneously for a real time packet. The results are summarized in Table 2.
