Abstract: The concept of informational independence plays a key role in most knowledge-based systems. Although defined differently in different contexts, its basic properties have been axiomatised by J. Pearl and his co-researchers. Pearl's axiomatic system offers a set of inference rules for deriving new independence statements from an initial set of statements and as such allows for a normal form for representing independences. Pearl's axioms, however, focus on mutually disjoint sets of variables only. We show that focusing on disjoint sets of variables can hide various interesting properties of independence. We extend Pearl's axiomatic system to capture these properties and thereby introduce a new normal form for infor mational independence.

Reference-contexts: Despite these definitional differences, the various perspectives on informational independence share the same basic properties. The basic properties of informational independence have been identified and taken to constitute an ax iomatic system for informational independence by J. Pearl and his co-researchers <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. There are many advantages to an axiomatic system for informational independence. Such a system offers a set of inference rules for computing new independence statements from an initial set of statements. <p> observations, Pearl argues that the concept of independence is far more basic to human reasoning than its numerical definition suggests and that in fact the definition of independence in terms of probabilities may be looked upon as a quantitative way of capturing the basic concept which is qualitative in nature <ref> [1] </ref>. Pearl's aim in designing an axiomatic system for informational independence now is to provide an explicit qualitative definition of independence. We begin our review of Pearl's axiomatic system for informational independence by introducing some notational convention. <p> In designing his axiomatic system for informational independence, Pearl identifies various properties that are satisfied by any probability distribution's independence relation and takes these as axioms for the qualitative concept of informational independence <ref> [1] </ref>. Definition 2.1 Let V be a finite set of variables. <p> The properties stated in Definition 2.1 with each other convey the idea that learning irrelevant information does not alter the independences among the variables discerned; for a discussion of the qualitative meanings of these properties, we refer the reader to <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> Dawid to hold for any probability distribution's independence relation [3]. To allow for deriving Dawid's property for overlapping sets of variables, Pearl introduces the axiom I (X; Z; Z) for all sets X; Z V <ref> [1] </ref>. This axiom asserts that, once information about Z is known, learning information about Z is irrelevant with respect to any set of variables X. The validity of the axiom in the context of probability theory is easily verified. <p> Z; Z; Y Z), for all sets X; Y; Z V . 4 On Normal Forms In his work on graphical representations of independence relations, Pearl builds on the restricted axiomatic system for informational independence, that is, on the system that involves axioms for mutually disjoint sets of variables only <ref> [1] </ref>. In this section, we address the question whether this focus on disjoint sets of variables is an essential one. To this end, we examine an independence relation's set of statements that involve overlapping sets of variables.
