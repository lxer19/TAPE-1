Reference-contexts: In order to compare the two models, we use the same Procrustes procedure to rotate one model onto another. 3 Example We now present a case study involving the globin family, chosen largely because it has been studied extensively in prior studies of protein structure families <ref> [1, 16, 5] </ref>. <p> We studied the seven globin structures examined by Bashford and colleagues <ref> [1] </ref>: human deoxyhe-moglobin ff (PDB accession 4HHBA) and fi (4HHBB), sperm whale deoxymyoglobin (5MBN), larval deoxyhe-moglobin (from Chironomous thummi , 1ECD), sea lamprey cyanohemoglobin (2LHB), yellow lupin root nodule cyanoleghemoglobin (Lupinus luteus, 2LH3), and annelid worm deoxyhemoglobin (Glycera dibranchiata, 2HBG).

Reference-contexts: Our method can find regression models using either affine or orthogonal transformation matrices. Affine transformations may add flexibility to the comparison of different structures, which may allow us to see similarities among protein structures that more constrained methods may miss. For instance, by relaxing the rotational constraint, Diamond <ref> [2] </ref> was able to superimpose oxy- and deoxyhe-moglobin appropriately. Our method is also able to handle robust least squares regression using weights, so that positions with high variability influence the result less than positions with less variability.

Reference-contexts: This generalization allows us to obtain the regression solution quickly, using a single eigendecomposition [9]. In contrast, when only rotations are allowed, the optimal superposition of multiple structures requires iterative or stochastic techniques <ref> [4, 11, 13, 3] </ref>. The rotation constraint essentially requires that each transformation matrix be orthogonal: B T Solving equation 1 subject to this constraint requires an iterative algorithm, whereas the optimal regression solution can be obtained in a single step.

Reference-contexts: We assume that variations in protein structure can be represented by a statistical model. A statistical model can be obtained using techniques from regression analysis to obtain a "template" structure that describes the entire family. Such templates are useful in understanding the structure and function of a given family <ref> [5] </ref>. Our approach is more general than existing methods, which generally rotate protein structures to superimpose corresponding atoms. If we permit each protein structure to undergo an affine transformation, which may include both rotation and shear components, we obtain an elegant and efficient method for superposition. <p> In order to compare the two models, we use the same Procrustes procedure to rotate one model onto another. 3 Example We now present a case study involving the globin family, chosen largely because it has been studied extensively in prior studies of protein structure families <ref> [1, 16, 5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For the first iteration, when there is no old model, we select one of the landmark matrices as the target. We apply the Procrustes solution to rotate each land mark matrix onto the old model <ref> [7, 6] </ref>. Let U j D j V T j be the singular value decomposition of M T M j . Then the optimal orthogonal transformation matrix of M j onto M is B j = V j U T j .

Reference-contexts: It can be shown that, under certain assumptions, the model found is the maximum likelihood estimate of the average protein structure <ref> [7] </ref>. Therefore, we view the analysis of protein families not merely as a superposition problem, but as a problem in modeling. The modeling approach is more general than superposition, and can be extended to handle different assumptions about how protein structures vary. <p> For the first iteration, when there is no old model, we select one of the landmark matrices as the target. We apply the Procrustes solution to rotate each land mark matrix onto the old model <ref> [7, 6] </ref>. Let U j D j V T j be the singular value decomposition of M T M j .

Reference-contexts: Gap penalty functions may be arbitrarily complex, but when they are linear functions, the time complexity is reduced from O (n 3 ) to O (n 2 ) <ref> [8] </ref>. Hence, we use g (x; y) = ff 0 + fi 0 (y x), and h (x; y) = ff 1 + fi 1 (y x), except we require the gap penalty be zero when y x = 1.

Reference-contexts: Our statistical model allows each protein structure to undergo a general affine transformation, which permits not only rotations, as in existing approaches, but also shear in three dimensions. This generalization allows us to obtain the regression solution quickly, using a single eigendecomposition <ref> [9] </ref>. In contrast, when only rotations are allowed, the optimal superposition of multiple structures requires iterative or stochastic techniques [4, 11, 13, 3]. <p> Our algorithm stores j at each step, for use in later superpositions. The objective function in equation 1 can be solved using least-squares regression, following a method described by Hastie and colleagues <ref> [9] </ref>. To avoid degen eracies, we require that M is orthogonal, so M T I.

Reference-contexts: The method of matching discrete curvatures provides an alternative to existing methods for finding correspondences. Because discrete curvature is a scalar function, it simplifies the dynamic programming procedure compared with matching vector sets [16, 15], distance matrices <ref> [10] </ref>, or properties [17]. Finally, in this paper, we make a contribution to dynamic programming methods by introducing a concept called adaptive dynamic programming. Dynamic programming methods depend heavily upon particular parameters called gap penalties, which must be chosen carefully for each problem.

Dynamic programming finds a correspondence between two structures that minimizes the overall distance between the structures. Let r and s be the sequence indices of atoms in structure matrices S i and S j , respectively. Let d (r; s) be some distance metric between atoms r and s.

Reference-contexts: Our method generates regression models in a matter of seconds, and this speed may permit other types of investigations, such as cluster analyses of protein structures. Many methods exist for finding initial correspondences, such as secondary structure methods <ref> [14] </ref>. One advantage of the discrete curvature method presented here is that it does not require prior definitions of secondary structure. Moreover, discrete curvature may be useful in other applications.

This weighted objective function shows that weights w i can also be used to emphasize certain segments in the protein structure. Equivalently, positions with large variances will be given less weight.
