Title: SPECIFICATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF PARALLEL ALGORITHMS WITH THE PROTEUS SYSTEM  
Author: ALLEN GOLDBERG, PETER MILLS, LARS NYLAND, JAN PRINS, JOHN REIF, AND JAMES RIELY 
Abstract: The Proteus language is a wide-spectrum parallel programming notation that supports the expression of both high-level architecture-independent specifications and lower-level architecture-specific implementations. A methodology based on successive refinement and interactive experimentation supports the development of parallel algorithms from specification to various efficient architecture-dependent implementations. The Proteus system combines the language and tools supporting this methodology. This paper presents a brief overview of the Proteus system and describes its use in the exploration and development of several non-trivial algorithms, including the fast multipole algorithm for N-body computations.

Reference-contexts: The Proteus iterator construct captures the essence of comprehensions. For example, if A and B are sequences of length n, then the iterator expression [ i in [1..n]: A [i] + B [i] ] specifies the sequence [A <ref> [1] </ref>+B [1], A [2]+B [2], : : : , A [n]+B [n]].

Program Development Methodology and Tools Starting with an initial high-level specification, Proteus programs are developed through program transformations which incrementally incorporate architectural detail, yielding a form translatable to efficient lower-level parallel virtual machines.

Process-Parallelism. Proteus provides a minimal set of constructs for the explicit parallel composition of processes which communicate through shared state. More sophisticated concurrency abstractions, such as buffered communication channels and monitors, may be constructed from these. 2.2.1. Process Creation. Process parallelism may be specified in two ways. <p> The program is then vectorized using source-to-source transformations (iterator elimination). Finally the code is translated into C with nested sequence operations. This process is described in detail in [24]. The C Vector Library (CVL) <ref> [2] </ref> implements operations on vectors of scalar values.

Reference-contexts: Note that unlike comprehensions, the bound variable of an iterator is written first, improving the readability of long expressions. Nested parallelism is widely applicable, as we demonstrate here by writing a data-parallel quicksort algorithm (adapted from <ref> [3] </ref>). Recall that given a sequence, quick-sort works by choosing an arbitrary pivot element and partitioning the sequence into subsequences (lesser, equal, greater) based on the pivot. The algorithm is then applied recursively on the lesser and greater subsequences, terminating when the sequences are singletons or empty. <p> Note that this algorithm cannot be expressed conveniently in languages such as High Performance FORTRAN, in which all aggregates must be rectangular and non-nested. The utility of nested data-parallelism has long been established in high-level languages like SETL and APL2. Blelloch <ref> [3] </ref> showed that nested and irregular data-parallelism can be vectorized. We have developed a set of transformations 4 GOLDBERG, MILLS, NYLAND, PRINS, REIF, AND RIELY that translate Proteus data-parallelism to the portable low-level vector model CVL [24, 2]. 2.2. Process-Parallelism. <p> The accuracy and confidence of assessment thus increases as the level of architectural detail incorporated into the program increases. Moreover, to support the assessment of multi-paradigm programs we use different models for analysis of code segments following different paradigms, such as the vram <ref> [3] </ref> for data-parallelism and LogP [8] for message-passing, with suitable instrumentation to "attach" the model to the program. Support for such multiple refined performance-prediction models is under SPEC. & DEV. OF PARALLEL ALGS. WITH THE PROTEUS SYSTEM 9 development. 3.4. Module Interconnection Facility.

Reference-contexts: After each step, there was great value in executing the new version to compare it with the previous version. With respect to automated translation, our main effort thus far has been the development of a translation that vectorizes arbitrary data-parallel expressions. This is a non-trivial translation; only Nesl <ref> [4] </ref> and Proteus provide this capability to date. We were able to use transformation tools from the Kestrel Institute to rapidly implement this translation; these tools are capable of generating good code and performing significant analysis.

The foundation of the FMA prototype is the description of the algorithm by Greengard <ref> [11] </ref>, where solutions in two-dimensions using uniform and adaptive spatial decomposition strategies are described, followed by a much more complex algorithm for a uniformly decomposed three-dimensional solution.

Reference-contexts: The size of the data-parallel prototype (which implements all 3 decompositions) is 477 executable lines of Proteus. The most compact C implementation with which we are familiar consists of just under 2000 executable statements, and this only implements the uniform spatial decomposition <ref> [12] </ref>. Developing the mathematical code for the 3D variants is extremely complex. Fortunately, at the intermediate steps in the development, it was simple to make comparisons with the direct (O (N 2 )) force calculations.
