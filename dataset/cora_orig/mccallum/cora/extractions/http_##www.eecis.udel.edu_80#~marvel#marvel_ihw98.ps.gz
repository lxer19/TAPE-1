Abstract: In this paper we present a new method for reliable blind image steganography that can hide and recover a message of substantial length within digital imagery while maintaining the original image size and dynamic range. Image processing, error-control coding, and spread spectrum techniques are utilized to conceal hidden data and the performance of the technique is illustrated. The message embedded by this method can be in the form of text, imagery, or any other digital signal. Applications for such a data-hiding scheme include in-band captioning, hidden communication, im age tamperproofing, authentication, embedded control, and revision tracking.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Digital steganography, or information hiding, schemes can be characterized by utilizing the theories of communication <ref> [1] </ref>. The parameters of information hiding such as the amount of data bits that can be hidden, the perceptibility of the message, and its robustness to removal can be related to the characteristics of communication systems: capacity, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and jamming margin. <p> A texture mapping method that copies areas of random textures from one area of the image to another is also described. Simple autocorrelation of the signal is used to expose the hidden information. Smith and Comiskey presented several spread spectrum data-hiding methods in <ref> [1] </ref>. These techniques utilize the message data to modulate a carrier signal, which is then combined with the cover image in sections of nonoverlapping blocks. The message is extracted via cross correlation between the stegoimage and the regenerated carrier; hence, cover image escrow is not necessary. <p> Perceptual masking refers to any situation where information in certain regions of an image is occluded by perceptually more prominent information in another part of the scene [15]. This masking is performed in either the spatial or frequency domain using techniques similar to [3] and <ref> [1] </ref> without cover image escrow. The capacity of this system is naturally cover-image-dependent and not quantified. 3 SSIS Techniques of spread spectrum communication, error-control coding, and image processing are combined to accomplish SSIS.

Reference-contexts: To be useful, a steganographic system must provide a method to embed data invisibly, allow the data to be readily extracted, promote a high information rate or capacity, and incorporate a certain amount of robustness to removal <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. With more of today's communications occurring electronically, there have been advancements in using digital signals as vehicles for steganographic communication. These signals, which are typically audio, video, or still imagery, are defined as cover signals. <p> Examples of such schemes can be found in [3], [10], and [11]. Several procedures for data hiding in multimedia can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. One of these, entitled Patchwork, alters the statistics of the cover image. First, pairs of image regions are selected using a pseudorandom number generator.

Reference-contexts: These signals, which are typically audio, video, or still imagery, are defined as cover signals. Schemes where the original cover signal is needed to reveal the hidden information are known as cover escrow. They can be useful in traitor tracing schemes such as those described in <ref> [4] </ref>. In this scenario, copies of the cover signal are disseminated with the assignee's identification embedded within, resulting in a modified cover signal.

Reference-contexts: More pragmatic methods, known as blind or oblivious schemes, allow direct extraction of the embedded data from the modified signal without knowledge of the original cover. Blind strategies are predominant among steganography of the present day. A block diagram of a blind system is depicted in Figure 1 <ref> [5] </ref>. A message is embedded in a digital image by the stegosystem encoder, which uses a key or password. The resulting stegoimage is transmitted in some fashion over a channel to an intended recipient, where it is processed by the stegosystem decoder using the same key.

Reference-contexts: One method of data hiding entails the manipulation of the least significant bit (LSB) plane, from direct replacement of the cover LSBs with message bits to some type of logical or arithmetic combination between the two. Several examples of LSB schemes can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>, [7], and [8]. LSB manipulation programs have also been written for a variety of image formats and can be found in [9]. LSB methods typically achieve both high capacity and low perceptibility.

However, because the fact that the data are hidden in the least significant bit may be known, LSB methods are vulnerable to extraction by unauthorized parties.

Reference-contexts: Some of the hidden data may be lost if the phase of the modulated carrier is recovered in error. A data-hiding scheme using the statistical properties of dithered imagery is proposed by Tanaka et al. <ref> [12] </ref>. With this method, the dot patterns of the ordered dither pixels are controlled by the information bits to be concealed.

Reference-contexts: An information-hiding ratio of 1:6 is obtain for trilevel images of the same size. The method has high capacity but is restricted to dithered images and is not resistant to errors in the stegoimage. Davern and Scott presented an approach to image steganography utilizing fractal image compression operations <ref> [13] </ref>. An information bit is embedded into the stegoim-age by transforming one similar block into an approximation for another. The data are decoded using a visual key that specifies the position of the range and domain regions containing the message.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, the amount of data that can be hidden using the method is small and susceptible to bit errors. Additionally, the search for similar blocks in the encoder, and the decoder comparison process, are both computationally expensive operations. Recent research performed by Swanson, Zhu, and Tewfik <ref> [14] </ref> utilizes an approach of perceptual masking to exploit characteristics of the human visual system (HVS) for data hiding. Perceptual masking refers to any situation where information in certain regions of an image is occluded by perceptually more prominent information in another part of the scene [15].

Reference-contexts: The estimate of the message is then decoded via the low-rate error-control decoder, optionally decrypted using key 1 and revealed to the recipient. Fig. 2. SSIS Encoder. Wideband thermal noise, inherent to imagery of natural scenes captured by pho-toelectronic systems, can be modeled as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) <ref> [16] </ref>. SSIS uses this inherent noise to hide the hidden information within the digital image. In other types of coherent imaging, the noise can be modeled as speckle noise [16], which is produced by coherent radiation from the microwave to visible regions of the spectrum. <p> thermal noise, inherent to imagery of natural scenes captured by pho-toelectronic systems, can be modeled as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) <ref> [16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Subsequently, an observer will be unable to visually distinguish the original image from the stegoimage with the embedded signal. To construct the embedded signal, we incorporate the concept of a stored reference spread spectrum communications system <ref> [17] </ref> to provide low probability of detection, either by computer or the HVS. The stored reference principle requires independent generation of identical pseudorandom wideband waveforms at both the transmitter and receiver. This can easily be accomplished by a private or public key [18] and identical pseudorandom waveform generators.

Our initial system incorporated a simple sign modulation system similar to the technique of Hartung and Girod presented in <ref> [19] </ref>. However in order to obtain an increase in detection performance, a nonlinear modulation scheme was developed for SSIS to spread the spectrum of the narrowband message signal, m. For each message bit, m i , we need to produce two modulation values from a Gaussian distribution.

Reference-contexts: This filter is invoked within SSIS using the algorithm developed by Lee <ref> [20] </ref>. The resultant restored image is scaled according to the relation of 2 s . If 2 s is much greater than the contrast of the degraded image, the contrast is assumed to be primarily due to the signal s and is significantly attenuated.

Reference-contexts: When the transmission channel is expected to be noisy, the appropriate low-rate error-correcting code can be selected to provide desired performance. Any error-correcting code that is capable of correcting for the high signal estimation BER can be used within SSIS.
