These systems are ongoing research efforts and continue to be augmented with additional software tools in order to make them more viable and useful.

Reference-contexts: In fact, many 22 1 2 3 W 1 2!4 1!3 3!4 process graphs are more likely to be regular graphs than irregular graphs. For example, well known parallel algorithms such as recursive doubling, fast-fourier transform, and so on utilize regular process graphs. We consider several regular graphs <ref> [6, 31, 38, 39, 48] </ref>: tree, 2-D mesh (torus), 3-D mesh (torus) and multidimensional grid (torus) 4 . In each case we consider two versions of the network: unidirectional and bidirectional.

Reference-contexts: Our proposed network architecture takes advantage of recent advances in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology. WDM provides a way to exploit the bandwidth available in a single mode fiber by modulating different wavelengths of light to provide several smaller bandwidth subchannels <ref> [11, 12, 21, 29, 33] </ref>.

The transmission from one node to another is accomplished by tuning the receivers to the transmitters wavelength (or vice-versa). This allows many concurrent transmissions, each on a different wavelength, to be performed simultaneously. <p> This is because the accessible bandwidth is inversely proportional to the tuning speed of the device <ref> [12] </ref>. For example, the Fabry-Perot receiver can support several hundred subchannels, but the tuning speed of the device is on the order of a few milliseconds. In contrast, a electro-optic receiver has a tuning speed of a few nanoseconds but can support only about ten subchannels.

Finally, at NASA Lewis, they are developing an Application Portable Parallel Library (APPL) which is based in part on the P4 and PVM projects. <p> Software systems which provide such programming environments already exist or are under development at this time.

These systems are ongoing research efforts and continue to be augmented with additional software tools in order to make them more viable and useful.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the greater the value of W max , the greater is the flexibility in designing a TWDM transmission schedule. Several other properties and constraints of TWDM transmission schedules can be found in <ref> [47] </ref>. 4.2 Irregular Process Graphs In general N g can be an irregular graph. This subsection explores the problem of embedding irregular graphs into TWDM transmission schedules and proposes a few heuristic solution approaches. Note that an optimum solution for this problem can be combinato-rially complex. <p> This is done until all the transmitters and receivers in the network have each been assigned a wavelength. From Figure 7 a), we see that only one wavelength could be utilized. In general, this is a significant problem with the direct embedding approach <ref> [47] </ref>. When a large number of wavelengths are available, a direct embedding is not a good idea as it doesn't lead to a high utilization of the optical fiber bandwidth. <p> Inability to utilize many wavelengths can be observed in the following direct embedding result for bidirectional process graphs (more details in <ref> [47] </ref>): The direct embedding of a bidirectional process graph will use at most one wavelength if there exists an odd cycle in the process graph.

[48] and [51] address some of the underlying design principles for optically switched WDM networks including the embedding of virtual topologies into regular and irregular physical topologies. In [50], the concept of virtual embeddings is extended to high performance heterogeneous computing. <p> In [50], the concept of virtual embeddings is extended to high performance heterogeneous computing.

In 15 [20], a TWDM scheme based on a bus-mesh virtual topology is presented. As in [52], a multicast capability is incorporated into the network exploiting the inherent broadcast nature of the optical passive star.
