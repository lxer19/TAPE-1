Abstract: Emerging heterogeneous, multimedia network applications, such as video teleconferencing, require guarantees of timely and effective information delivery. In particular, it is important that the network does not commit to an additional service unless throughput and timeliness guarantees can be provided for both the new and existing connections. However, as both hardware changes and applications diversify, the forms of traffic patterns and of guarantees are impossible to predict a priori. In this paper, we provide a general model of traffic flows, and a schedulability test for a set of such flows on a packet-switched virtual-circuit fixed-packet network, together with a set of rules designed to make evaluation of the schedulability conditions feasible and efficient. An experimental study is presented which demonstrates the usefulness of the proposed rules and offers recommendations for building actual networks. We also derive testing sets for some standard traffic models and discuss issues of efficient implementation of the schedulability test.

On the other hand, performance analysis becomes more complicated. Several kinds of constraints have been considered in the literature | we describe some of them briefly below. The sporadic model of <ref> [1, 2, 17, 24] </ref> is a discrete traffic model. The description of a data stream is done by specifying pair of parameters (p; s), where p is the minimum message inter-arrival time and s is the maximum message size.

Reference-contexts: As a general rule, the time to transfer a packet from an input link to an output link buffer (switching delay) is usually negligible in comparison with waiting time in the buffer (queueing delay) and transmission time of the packet (transmission delay) <ref> [3, 24] </ref>. In this study, we therefore assume that delay experienced by a packet in a switch comprises only queueing and transmission delays. The basic unit of data transfer is the packet , and all packets are of the same size.

Reference-contexts: Even though the derived performance guarantees are based on per-node analysis, it was shown by Georgiadis et al <ref> [12] </ref> 2 that when accompanied with traffic reshaping inside the network, EDF outperforms GPS in terms of end-to-end delay bounds, buffer requirements, and implementation simplicity. This makes EDF an efficient service discipline to employ at network nodes.

Reference-contexts: This optimality of EDF implies that EDF is a good scheduling discipline to employ at network nodes, at least from the view of satisfying delay bounds.

However in this paper, we do not require that EDF be the scheduling discipline employed at the network nodes | any optimal discipline can be used.
