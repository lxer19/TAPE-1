Abstract: A single fault in a complex network can generate a cascade of events, potentially overloading a manager's console with information. One way to reduce the number of events is event correlation, a process that groups several related events into a single composite event. We have developed Multi-Event Dependency Detection (MEDD), an algorithm that automatically constructs event correlation rules. MEDD is a prototype for a component of NASA's EOSDIS Core System. The algorithm efficiently searches the space of possible dependencies between events and selects the most useful rules. Preliminary results indicate that MEDD identifies useful rules for event correlation, and could reduce the information burden on network managers.

Reference-contexts: Event logs were generated by a modified version of the Netsim network simulator which is publicly available from MIT <ref> (Heybey & Robertson 1994) </ref>. Netsim is a discrete event simulator that models a network of components that communicate via the TCP/IP protocol. The simulator implements hosts, ethernet links, switches, point-to-point links (e.g. modems), TCP interfaces (both with and without the slow start protocol), poisson traffic sources, and uniform traffic sources.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, f (up *)g ) f (down router)g is a valid child, but f (up router)g ) f (down *)g would not be generated because it requires adding a non-wildcard to the left of down.

Reference-contexts: Systematic search non-redundantly enumerates the elements of search spaces for which the value or semantics of any given node are independent of the path from the root to that node. Webb calls such search spaces unordered <ref> (Webb 1996) </ref>. Consider the space of disjunctive concepts over the set of literals fA; B; Cg.
