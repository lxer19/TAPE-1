Title: Time-Multiplexing Optical Interconnection Networks; Why Does it Pay Off

Abstract: Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is typically applied whenever the capacity of a resource is larger than the individual requirements of any of its clients. This is the case in optical interconnection networks in which the bandwidth of an optical path is much larger than the rate at which a processor can generate data. However, in addition to closing the gap between the bandwidth of electronic processing and that of optical transmission, I argue in this paper that multiplexing optical networks is essential to reduce the overhead of controlling the network. This reduction is a result of increasing the number of connections that do not require control operations. I present a preliminary model to specify the communication requirements of applications and use this model to gain some intuition about the advantages of multiplexing interconnection networks, especially in cases where communications exhibit strong locality properties.

Reference-contexts: This intuition is confirmed in various simulation studies reported in [2, 6, 12]. Next, systems in which the connection requests may be known in advance are considered. 5 TDM for Compiled Communications Studies on numerical algorithms [3] and other benchmark parallel programs <ref> [1] </ref> show that 80% of the communication requirements of large scale parallel applications are static. That is, can be determined at compile time. An additional 19% are parametric. That is, can be expressed at compile time in terms of a parameter which is specified only at run-time. <p> Only 1% of the communication requirement are dynamic references that cannot be predicted by the compiler. The above observations strongly advocate the notion of compiling the communication requirements of an application <ref> [1] </ref>. Specifically, if the connection requests cr 1 ; : : : ; cr m are known at compile time, then the realizable series R 1 ; R 2 ; : : : and the corresponding values of the network status registers can also be determined at compile time.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, examples are given for the multiplexing of networks in which configurations are established by setting electro/optical switches. The same time multiplexing techniques may be equally applied to networks in which configurations are established by arbitrating passive optical couplers [6], assigning wavelengths to transmitters and receivers <ref> [4] </ref> or assigning transmitting slots on pipelined optical busses [9]. The time multiplexing approach is very suitable to applications in which most of the communication requirements are known at compile time. The majority of applications that require massive parallelism fall into this category.

Reference-contexts: A set of connections, C, that can be established in a given state will be called a configuration. For example, consider the multistage network shown in Figure 1, where each switch is an electro optical switch (Ti:LiNbO 3 switch, for example <ref> [7] </ref>) which can be in either a straight or a cross state [10, 13]. Although each switch connects optical inputs to optical outputs without optical/electronic conversion, the state of the switch is controlled by an electronic signal.

This paradigm was called Reconfiguration with Time Division Multiplexing in <ref> [10] </ref>. So, why does it pay off to time multiplex optical networks?. First, without multiplexing, the control overhead of establishing all optical paths may be prohibitive. Second, applications exhibit communication locality which amplifies the benefits of multiplexing the network.

Reference-contexts: Another example is the mesh connected system shown in Figure 2. Each processor in the system has an input and an output connection to a 5 fi 5 switch, which, in turns, is connected to four other switches in the north, south, east and west directions <ref> [11] </ref>. The 5 fi 5 switch may be constructed from 2 fi 2 electro/optical switches, and thus its state may be set by setting a few electronic bits.
