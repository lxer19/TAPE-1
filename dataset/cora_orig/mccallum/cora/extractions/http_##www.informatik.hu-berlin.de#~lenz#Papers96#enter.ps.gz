Title: IMTAS: Intelligent Multimedia Travel Agent System  
Author: Mario Lenz 
Address: Lindenstr. 54a, D-10117 Berlin  
Affiliation: Humboldt University, Dept. of Computer Science,  
Abstract: This paper introduces IMTAS, an architecture enhancing existing tourist information systems with modern AI and multimedia technologies. IMTAS allows for a more flexible access to up-to-date information and supports new means of distribution in the tourism market. Keywords: Information systems, decision support systems, system archi tectures.

Reference-contexts: This also holds for the architecture proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.2 Presenting multimedia information In order to provide the customer with up to date information, IMTAS includes a module for the presentation of multimedia information. The idea is to build these facilities on top of some world-wide available network service (such as the World Wide Web).

Reference-contexts: Here standard WWW utilities provide little help. Therefore, we adopted an agent-oriented approach to combine the different modules of functionality. However, in contrast to other approaches (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>), a single agent does not refer to specific parts of package tours. Rather, the agents can be distinguished according to the underlying functionality: The CBR agent implements a case-based inference taking into account the initial description of the customer's desires as well as information obtained from the WWW agent.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the CBR inference component of the IMTAS architecture can be enhanced with additional knowledge, such as classification or adaptation rules, model-based knowledge and so on. CaBaTa, a first prototype implementing the ideas of CBR on the travel domain, has already been introduced in <ref> [4] </ref>.
