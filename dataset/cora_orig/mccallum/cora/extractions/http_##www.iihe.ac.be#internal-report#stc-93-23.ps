Abstract: In OSI community, Quality of Service can be evaluated through CCITT Recommendations that are applied for OSI based networks as well as for OSI based applications. The author describes here a realization of congestion control mechanisms in a OSI based packet switched network system that make a direct influence to QoS offered to the end users by the network. Among other designing objectives the special attention was paid to the data transfer phase of running applications i.e. on preserving the throughput on the user interface while protecting network resources. This solution is original and takes in account the network specific resources, protocol specifics and typical nowadays network application characteristics. Experience obtained from this conventional network can be useful in research and design of the solutions for the future networks.
