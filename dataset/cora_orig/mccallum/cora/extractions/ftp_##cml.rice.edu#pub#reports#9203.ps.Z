Title: Wavelet Interpolation and Approximate Solutions of Elliptic Partial Differential Equations  
Author: Raymond O. Wells, Jr. Xiaodong Zhou 
Date: August 30, 1993  
Abstract: The paper formulates and proves a second order interpolation result for square-integrable functions by means of locally finite series of Daubechies' wavelets. Sample values of a sufficiently smooth function can be used as coefficients of a wavelet expansion at a fine scale, and the corresponding wavelet interpolation function converges in Sobolev norms of first order to the original function. This has applications to wavelet-Galerkin numerical solutions of elliptic partial differential equations.

Reference-contexts: a weak solution of a differential equation, we look for a solution (the Galerkin solution) of the finite dimensional linear system of equations obtained from the weak form of the differential equation by restricting the test functions and the solution function to both be in the approximation space W (see <ref> [4] </ref> for a discussion of this). More specifically let be a bounded open set in R 2 with a Lipschitz boundary. Let W j := ff 2 V j : suppf " 6= ;g: Since is bounded it's clear that W j is a finite-dimensional subspace of V j .

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In 1988 Daubechies introduced in <ref> [5] </ref> a class of compactly supported wavelet functions which give a very nice decomposition of L 2 (R), and by tensor products, L 2 (R n ). <p> will concentrate in this paper on this distinguished family of wavelets, which are defined by specific coefficient systems fa 0 ; a 1 ; : : : ; a 2N1 g, which define the scaling functions which we denote simply as (x) and which is denoted by N (x) in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> is called the scaling vector for the system, and we define the associated wavelet vector (b 0 ; : : : ; b 2N1 ) by defining b k := (1) k+1 a 2N1k (4) This is the convention used in [10] and differs slightly from that used originally in <ref> [5] </ref>. We define the corresponding wavelet function (x) by (x) := k=0 With this convention, both the scaling function (x) and the corresponding wavelet function (x) have the same compact support [0; 2N 1]. Moreover, we have the following properties of moments of these functions. <p> Moreover, and are both differentiable of a certain finite order ff (N ), where ff = O (N ), with ff (2) ~ = 0:55, ff (3) ~ = 1:088, etc. (see <ref> [5] </ref>, [6], [18]), where the latter two references give asymptotic formulas for ff (n).

Reference-contexts: In particular we recall the Mallat algorithm for determining wavelet series coefficients from one level to another, which is very useful in applications (see Mallat [11]), and plays an important role in our interpolation scheme and its applications in <ref> [8] </ref> and [20]. The Mallat algorithm leads to a natural interpolation by finite level wavelet series for a given function.
