Abstract: In this paper we present an approach to robot arm control based on exploiting the dynamical properties of a simple neural network oscillator circuit coupled to the joints of an arm. The entrainment and input/output properties of the oscillators are used to perform a variety of tasks with the same architecture, without any modeling of the arm or its environment. The approach is implemented on two real robot arms, and has been used to tune into the resonant frequency of pendulums, perform multi-joint coordinated motion by turning cranks, and exploit the dynamics of a `Slinky' toy to coordinate the motion of two arms. By exploiting the coupling between the physical arm and the neural oscillator, a range of complex behaviors can be achieved with a very simple system.

Reference-contexts: It is also appealing to suggest that this approach can be extended to discrete motions, perhaps Neural Control of Rhythmic Arm Movements 13 by using the approach of Schoner (1990), although evidence from human motion suggests that rhythmic and discrete motions may be planned in separate systems <ref> (Adamovich et al., 1994) </ref>. To conclude, using the approach presented in this paper may allow general oscillatory motion, and more complex rhythmic tasks to be achieved by exploiting the coupled dynamics of an oscillator system and the arm dynamics.

Reference-contexts: Later Greene (1982) suggested methods which would result in simple and naturally stable control. By using parts of the arm dynamics which are suited to the task, the system can avoid the accurate calibration and modeling that is required in more recent traditional robotic approaches <ref> (An et al., 1988, Craig, 1989) </ref>. Humans certainly learn to exploit the dynamics of their limbs for rhythmic tasks (Schneider et al., 1989), during development (Thelen et al., 1992) and also to perform certain tasks like overarm throwing (Bingham et al., 1989).

Robotic examples of this idea include "open-loop stable" systems (Schaal and Atkeson, 1993), where the dynamics are exploited giving systems which require little or no active control for stable operation.

Reference-contexts: The tasks have all been performed using the same neural architecture, with minimal parameter changes, and without any modeling of the arm or its environment. The arms used are mounted on the humanoid robot Cog <ref> (Brooks and Stein, 1994) </ref>, shown in point. Each joint of the robot is actuated by an independent oscillator, consisting of two simulated neurons in mutual inhibition (Matsuoka, 1985). <p> Section 6 concludes the paper with a discussion and suggestions for further work. Neural Control of Rhythmic Arm Movements 4 2 The arms and the oscillators The two arms used in this experiment are mounted on the humanoid robot Cog <ref> (Brooks and Stein, 1994) </ref>. The arms have been specially designed to interact stably and robustly with unstructured environments. They have six degrees of freedom (dof) arranged in an anthropomorphic manner, each joint being actuated by a series elastic actuator (Pratt and Williamson, 1995, Williamson, 1995).

Reference-contexts: They have six degrees of freedom (dof) arranged in an anthropomorphic manner, each joint being actuated by a series elastic actuator (Pratt and Williamson, 1995, Williamson, 1995). These actuators give low noise force control, shock tolerance, and are stable when interacting with passive environments <ref> (Colgate and Hogan, 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The coupling is crucial to the work presented in this paper, as well as to the work of Hatsopoulos (1996). Work on gait transitions in legged locomotion also indicates the importance of coupling: researchers have achieved similar gait transitions independent of the particular choice of oscillator <ref> (Collins and Richmond, 1994, Pribe et al., 1997) </ref>. An alternative to increasing the complexity of the oscillators is to increase the complexity of the oscillator network, i.e., allow connections between the oscillators at different joints.

Reference-contexts: Traditional robotic solutions to these problems have been to model the constraint, and determine ways to control the force exerted by the robot (e.g., controlling position and force separately (Raibert and Craig, 1981), or together <ref> (Hogan, 1985a) </ref>). In recent work by Niemeyer and Slotine (1997) and Deacon (1997), the constraint is used to reactively define the movement, without using explicit modeling. <p> The torque limit mentioned above does allow the oscillators to produce a non-sinusoidal output, although in a rather limited way. Traditional robot approaches to this kind of manipulation (hybrid force/position control (Raibert and Craig, 1981), or impedance control <ref> (Hogan, 1985a) </ref>), use explicit kinematic knowledge of the arm and the crank location to solve this problem. Like the oscillator system, these methods are sensitive to errors in crank location.

Reference-contexts: Operating at arm-level as opposed to joint-level should allow more complex tasks to be performed. As well as having muscles that span one joint, humans have muscles which span two or more joints (Kahle et al., 1992). This redundant actuation architecture gives a rich repertoire of arm behaviors <ref> (Hogan, 1985b) </ref>. By applying oscillators both at the joint and spanning various joints, the human system could be mimicked. Coordination of this redundant control system could then be achieved using the entrainment properties of the oscillators.

Reference-contexts: It also shows clearly how the properties of the environment (in this case the mass of the slinky) can be used to give simple control and robust behavior. 5.2 Flailing As well as perturbations from external objects, the arm when it moves is subject to perturbations from the arm dynamics <ref> (Hollerbach and Flash, 1982) </ref>. By relying on these internal forces, the oscillators can be used to coordinate the arms during motion.

Reference-contexts: The use of the oscillator structure would then confer on the final motion all the advantageous properties of the oscillator system: robustness to changes in frequency, low sensitivity to parameters values, and stability against perturbations. One method to achieve this may be to use feedback error learning <ref> (Kawato, 1990) </ref>. The combination of a feedforward oscillator controller and a feedback system could be used to generate the arm motion.

Reference-contexts: The entrainment range is large, in this case w n = 7 rad/s, and the range is 1.5 to 35 rad/s. The oscillator is a non-linear system, but given its strong entrainment property, conventional non-linear systems representations (e.g., phase plane plots <ref> (Vidyasagar, 1978) </ref>) are not very expressive of the system behavior as the input frequency and size is varied. Better intuition is gained by evaluating the behavior of the system at different frequencies, and presenting the analysis in a linear system format (e.g., a bode plot).
