Title: Spline Approximations to Value Functions: A Linear Programming Approach  
Author: Michael A. Trick Stanley E. Zin 
Date: May 1995 Revised: January 1997  
Abstract: We review the properties of algorithms that characterize the solution the Bellman equation of a stochastic dynamic program, as the solution to a linear program. The variables in this problem are the ordinates of the value function, hence, the number of variables grows with the state space. For situations when this size becomes computationally burdensome, we suggest the use of low-dimensional cubic-spline approximations to the value function. We show that fitting this approximation through linear programming provides upper and lower bounds on the solution to the original "large" problem. The information contained in these bounds leads to inexpensive improvements in the accuracy of approximate solutions.
