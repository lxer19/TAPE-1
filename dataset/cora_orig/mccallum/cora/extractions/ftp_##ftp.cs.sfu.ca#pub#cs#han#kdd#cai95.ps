Abstract: Active research has been conducted on knowledge discovery in databases by the researchers in our group for years, with many interesting results published and a prototyped knowledge discovery system, DBMiner (previously called DBLearn), developed and demonstrated in several conferences. Our research covers a wide spectrum of knowledge discovery, including (1) the study of knowledge discovery in relational, object-oriented, deductive, spatial, and active databases, and global information systems, and (2) the development of various kinds of knowledge discovery methods, including attribute-oriented induction, progressive deepening for mining multiple-level rules, meta-rule guided knowledge mining, etc. Techniques for the discovery of various kinds of knowledge, including generalization, characterization, discrimination, association, classification, clustering, etc. and the application of knowledge discovery for intelligent query answering, multiple-layered database construction, etc. have also been studied in our research.
