Abstract: Within the instantaneous field of view of a scanning device often more than one object is included, resulting in a pixel in which several characteristics are mixed. Classically the proportions of the components of such a mixed pixel are estimated using a linear mixture model. In this paper a new method is introduced for estimating the characteristics of these components, from which their proportions can be derived. Experiments with simulated data sets are conducted to compare the methods regarding their accuracy on estimating the proportions. In addition it is determined how well the proposed method can estimate the characteristics of each component.
