Abstract: In the unidirectional conversion problem an on-line player is given the task of converting dollars to yen over some period of time. Each day, a new exchange rate is announced, and the player must decide how many dollars rate sequences, P OPT (E) is the number of yen obtained by an optimal off-line algorithm, and P X (E) is the number of yen obtained by the on-line algorithm X. We also consider a continuous version of the problem, in which the exchange rate varies over a continuous time interval. The on-line player's a priori information about the fluctuation of exchange rates distinguishes different variants of the problem. For three variants we show that a simple threat-based strategy is optimal for the on-line player and determine its competitive ratio. We also derive and analyze an optimal policy for the on-line player when he knows the probability distribution of the maximum value that the exchange rate will reach. Finally, we consider a bidirectional conversion problem, in which the player may trade dollars for yen or yen for dollars.

Reference-contexts: Despite the obvious significance and appeal of investment problems, we have found only two previous references concerned with the competitive analysis of on-line financial decision-making. The paper <ref> [Cover91] </ref> deals with the problem of portfolio selection for investment in the stock market. Here, the (on-line) player must determine the proportion of his wealth invested in each of the stocks in the market.

Reference-contexts: Note that the on-line portfolio selection strategy is very robust; it does not assume anything about the behavior of future events. The paper <ref> [Ragh91] </ref> analyzes the competitive performance of an on-line investment algorithm against a "statistical adversary," whose request sequence is required to satisfy certain distributional requirements.

Reference-contexts: An alternate approach in such situations and the one we explore here is to use competitive analysis (first applied to on-line algorithms by Sleator and Tarjan in <ref> [ST85] </ref>). In this approach, the performance of an on-line strategy is measured against that of an optimal off-line strategy having full knowledge of future events.
