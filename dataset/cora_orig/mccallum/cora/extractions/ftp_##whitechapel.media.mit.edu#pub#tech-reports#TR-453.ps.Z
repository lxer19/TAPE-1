Abstract: M.I.T. Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 453 submitted to IJCV, International Journal on Computer Vision Abstract The appearance of an object is composed of local structure. This local structure can be described and characterized by a vector of local features measured by local operators such as Gaussian derivatives or Gabor filters. This article presents a technique where appearances of objects are represented by the joint statistics of local neighborhood operators. As such, this represents a new class of appearance based techniques for computer vision. Based on joint statistics, the article develops techniques for the identification of multiple objects at arbitrary positions and orientations in a cluttered scene. Experiments show that this technique can identify over 100 objects in the presence of major occlusions. Most remarkably, the technique has low complexity and therefore runs in real-time.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the intersection measurement supposes that all measurements are equally probable, which cannot be assumed for an arbitrary measurement set M = [ k m k . The following introduces two comparison measurements: the intersection measurement and the 2 - statistics. Other possibilities include information theoretical comparison measurements <ref> [Basseville, 1996] </ref> and quadratic distances [Hafner et al., 1995] as for example the Mahalanobis distance. The histogram of a test image is signified by Q = 8 and scale. The image measurement is given by the Magnitude of the first derivative and the Laplace operator.

Reference-contexts: In the case of variant descriptors, image plane rotation is managed by the rotational steer-ability of local descriptors. The two rotational degrees of freedom r x and r y represent a viewpoint changes of the observer.

Reference-contexts: Our experiments have verified this result. A sparse distribution can be achieved by using high dimensional histograms. In this case the tradeoff between the ability to discriminate objects and stability with respect to perturbations becomes an important issue <ref> [Califano and Mohan, 1993] </ref>. A second inconvenience of the intersection is that all histogram cells are treated equally and should therefore be equally probable. An appropriate scaling of the different axes of the multidimensional histograms can be used (for example logarithmic scaling) but for the sake of stability.

Reference-contexts: We used Ga-bor filters in early experiments. Since the recognition results with Gabor filters and with Gaussian filters are almost identical we do not describe these experiments here. Invariant color descriptors [Nagao, 1995, Funt and Finlayson, 1995] might be used as local neighborhood operators. A study <ref> [Colin de Verdiere, 1996] </ref> showed in particular that the histograms of the derivatives of the logarithms of color channels provide a reliable means of recognition in the presence of changes of illumination intensity and even in the presence of light source color shifts.

Reference-contexts: The experiments described throughout the article use Gaussian derivatives because of their robustness as well as because of the steerability to image plane rotation and the equivariance property to scale. Gabor filters <ref> [Gabor, 1946, Westelius, 1992, Daugman, 1993] </ref> satisfy the same constraints as Gaussian filters (robustness, steerability to image plane rotation, equivariance to scale changes).

Reference-contexts: Gaussian derivatives are widely used in computer vision. Their popularity is due to their generality (eigenpictures of large 2 numbers of image patches resemble derivatives of Gaus--sians [Rao and Ballard, 1995]), their capacity to model the response of neural cells [Young, 1986] and the existence of a recursive implementation <ref> [Deriche, 1993] </ref>. Furthermore Gaussian derivatives (as well as Gabor filters) are robust to scale changes of approximately 20% [Rao and Ballard, 1995].

Reference-contexts: One can also consider the use of texture features [Haralick, 1979] or low-level geometric features and perceptual significant groups thereof [Pope and Lowe, 1996]. 2.1 Gaussian derivatives Gaussian derivatives are widely used in the literature and well understood <ref> [Freeman and Adelson, 1991, Rao and Ballard, 1995] </ref>. By using Gaussian derivatives we can explicitly select the scale. <p> Therefore it is desirable to define a finite set of basis filters and an interpolation rule, which allows the calculation the filter response based only on the response of the basis set <ref> [Freeman and Adelson, 1991] </ref>. For the first order Gaussian derivative there exists a well known linear interpolation rule: G x + sin G In order to formalize this property, Freeman and Adelson [Freeman and Adelson, 1991] start with a two-dimensional function F (x; y) and define F (x; y) as the <p> interpolation rule, which allows the calculation the filter response based only on the response of the basis set <ref> [Freeman and Adelson, 1991] </ref>. For the first order Gaussian derivative there exists a well known linear interpolation rule: G x + sin G In order to formalize this property, Freeman and Adelson [Freeman and Adelson, 1991] start with a two-dimensional function F (x; y) and define F (x; y) as the version of F (x; y) rotated by the angle . <p> Two important questions arise: how many interpolation functions are needed and how to obtain the interpolation functions. In order to formulate two theorems, the function F (x; y) is rewritten in polar coordinates r = p F (r; ) = n=N A first theorem <ref> [Freeman and Adelson, 1991] </ref> states that the steering constraint 19 holds for functions expandable in the form of 20 if and only if the interpola tion functions k j () are solutions of: 4 0 B @ e i e iN C C = B B 1 1 1 . . <p> A second theorem <ref> [Freeman and Adelson, 1991] </ref> states that the minimal number of interpolation functions is T , whereas T is the number of nonzero coefficients a n (r) in equation 20.

Reference-contexts: Scene changes like partial occlusion and background change are difficult to model. One possibility is to include partial occlusion and background change in the estimation process of the probability density function. Hornegger and Niemann <ref> [Hornegger and Niemann, 1995] </ref> propose to model partial occlusion as a particular object: the background. By introducing a probability for the background which is directly related to the observed portion of the object the probability of the presence of an object can be calculated. <p> Typically, parametric and non-parametric estimation schemes can be distinguished. Parametric estimators assume a certain type of distribution as for example a poison distribution or a Gaussian distribution. The learning therefore becomes an estimation of the parameter of the assumed distribution. Hornegger and Niemann <ref> [Hornegger and Niemann, 1995] </ref> use parameterized mixtures of multivariate Gaussian distributions including a feature transform. Their statistical model consider the statistical behavior of features, feature matching, as well as the projection from the model into the image space.

Reference-contexts: In general it is difficult to obtain a reliable estimate of such a high-dimensional probability density function. The difficulty is due to the fact that the number of training examples is exponential in the number of dimensions of the density function <ref> [Intrator and Gold, 1993] </ref>. The most effective way to reduce the number of free parameters is to choose local image measurements which are invariant in relation to different parameters.

Reference-contexts: The other principal possibility is a non-parametric estimator for the probability density function. In the context of high-dimensional density functions essentially two methods can be applied: histogramming and kernel function estimates <ref> [Popat and Picard, 1994] </ref>. The main advantage of histogramming is that the training samples are well represented. This property is desirable in our context since we aim to show that the proposed statistical object representation provides a reliable and discriminant means for the recognition of a large number of objects.

Reference-contexts: In the context of multidimensional receptive field 9 histograms we use 2 -statistics without using the 2 - probability function. 2 -statistics are used for the calculation of "dissimilarity" between two histograms. Two different ways of calculation of the 2 -statistics may be considered <ref> [Press et al., 1992] </ref>. The first - 2 v (Q; V ) assumes exact knowledge of the model histogram V : 2 X (q i v i ) 2 (26) A second calculation - 2 qv (Q; V ) compares two observed histograms (neither is theoretically derived).

Reference-contexts: In this case the approach relies on the fact that local descriptors can be calculated robustly with respect to such changes. The analysis of the robustness of the used local image measurements to such changes therefore demands special consideration. <ref> [Schiele, 1997] </ref> examines the robustness of local image measurements and different normalization techniques in the presence of additive Gaussian noise. In experiments we obtain a high robustness to light intensity changes by using Gaussian derivatives and an energy normalization technique of the filter outputs. <p> The histograms of different viewpoints have to be estimated from several images of the object corresponding to several viewpoints (represented by r x and r y ). <ref> [Schiele, 1997] </ref> examines the number of histograms which are needed for the representation of a 3D object. We concluded from experiments that a small number of histograms are sufficient in order to obtain high recognition rates. <p> This second 2 -statistics seems more appropriate in our context, since we do not assume exact knowledge of the model histogram V . 2 qv (Q; V ) is defined by: 2 X (q i v i ) 2 (27) As we concluded from experiments <ref> [Schiele, 1997] </ref>, these two 2 -statistics provide better recognition results for most cases than the intersection measurement (and different quadratic distances) with respect to image distortions due to appearance changes, additive Gaussian noise and blur.

Reference-contexts: The image plane rotation parameter r z can be accounted for by using local descriptors, which are invariant to r z . Such invariants have been proposed for example by Schmid and Mohr <ref> [Schmid and Mohr, 1996] </ref>. The main disadvantage of these local descriptors is that rotational information is lost. Another disadvantage is the underlying assumption that all rotations are equally probable, which cannot in general be assumed. <p> In the following we define such an algorithm as an extension of our probabilistic object recognition al gorithm of section 5.1. 6.1 Dynamic Hashtable A standard algorithm for recognition in cluttered scenes is based on a hashtable and an accumulator for each object. Schmid and Mohr <ref> [Schmid and Mohr, 1996] </ref> have recently shown the applicability of such an algorithm based on discriminant vectors of local image measurements.

Reference-contexts: A first recognition algorithm compares the probability distribution of local neighborhood operators of a test image to the distributions of the object models. Recognition is achieved by histogram matching which can be seen as a generalization of the color indexing scheme of Swain and Ballard <ref> [Swain and Ballard, 1991] </ref>. A second recognition algorithm calculates probabilities for the presence of objects within an image based on a small number of vectors of local neighborhood operators. <p> This algorithms runs on a Silicon Graphics O2-machine at 10Hz using the OpenGL-extension for real-time convolution of images. Having been inspired by the robustness and speed of the color histogram approach of Swain and Ballard <ref> [Swain and Ballard, 1991] </ref>, our aim has been to generalize their approach. In particular, we use joint statistics of arbitrary local neighborhood operators. From this generalization we derive a general statistical object representation framework. Such a statistical framework allows us to incorporate additional information without altering the recognition algorithm itself. <p> Swain and Ballard <ref> [Swain and Ballard, 1991] </ref> have proposed a similar technique which recognizes objects in an image by matching a color histogram from a region of the image with a color histogram from a sample of the object. <p> The analysis of such measurements is important since the intersection-measurement, used by Swain and Ballard <ref> [Swain and Ballard, 1991] </ref> in the context of color histograms, has limitations in the more general case of multidimensional receptive field histograms. In particular, the intersection measurement supposes that all measurements are equally probable, which cannot be assumed for an arbitrary measurement set M = [ k m k . <p> is the number of dimensions of a measurement vector m k and therefore the number of dimensions of the histogram. v i (respectively q i ) corresponds to the value of a particular cell of histogram V (respectively Q). 4.1.1 Intersection measurement Swain and Ballard introduced in their original work <ref> [Swain and Ballard, 1991] </ref> the intersection-measurement for the comparison of color histograms.
