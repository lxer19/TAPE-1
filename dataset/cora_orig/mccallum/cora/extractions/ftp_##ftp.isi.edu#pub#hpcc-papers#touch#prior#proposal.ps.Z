Reference-contexts: The first two are Real Direct and Virtual Direct - the former is explicit communication, the latter is common knowledge, i.e. information derived from communication to others in a group when global group constraints are known <ref> [HaMo84] </ref>. Here we also utilize Virtual Indirect communication, information known from a combination of prior constraints and the absence of explicit communication [ToFa89]. 3.1.

Reference-contexts: We also require a notation for describing an instance, in order to discuss the models implications in the definite. For this purpose, we have selected 9 Timed Petri Nets <ref> [MeFa76] </ref>, a variation of Petri Nets [Pete77, Petr62]. We extend these nets to describe the state transformations of Mirage, being careful to preserve the graphical/formal properties of the original nets. First, we begin with the Timed Petri Net (TPN) of a protocol. <p> The incorporation of time into protocols is limited to two methods, where time is modelled either by boundaries or by finite timesteps. In the former, actions occur when these boundaries are exceeded, as in Timed Petri Nets, temporal logic, or timeout timers in more conventional models <ref> [MeFa76, Sc82] </ref>. In Mirage, time is a fully parametric value, a continuous entity, over which other entities vary. 1 1 Similarly, the modelling of time as an aging variable [Sh82] is not as general a concept.

Reference-contexts: This decrease causes conventional protocols to decrease in channel utilization, many of which are designed for file transfer based on sliding window flow control. One possible reason for the deterioration of efficiency in existing protocols is that they operate in a point model, based on Shannons communication theory <ref> [ShWe63] </ref>. <p> Shannons Model - Extensions for High Speed Shannons mathematical model of communication defines channel bandwidth and capacity, and analyzes the capacity of the channel under the constraint of transmission error <ref> [ShWe63] </ref>. In his model, the channel is viewed as a pipe between the communicating nodes [Figure 2]. Bandwidth is a unit of volume of flow in this pipe - bits wide x signal duration.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Mirage is a model for the analysis and design of high speed wide-area protocols <ref> [ToFa89] </ref>. The primary goal of this model is to understand the effects of moving to the gigabit domain in wide area networks, verifying or disproving the predicted failure of existing protocols, and anticipate potential solutions. <p> Here we also utilize Virtual Indirect communication, information known from a combination of prior constraints and the absence of explicit communication <ref> [ToFa89] </ref>. 3.1. Guarded messages Also described in Mirage is the use of guarded messages, similar to the guarded commands, as used in programming languages. <p> In this model, there is an indication that two messages with null-intersecting guards are information redundant, thus constructed to have equivalent results on the receiving node. They are data distinct, but thus information redundant <ref> [ToFa89] </ref>. Guarded messages permit the expansion of the state space of a transmitting node to be constrained sufficiently to remain tractable. The information redundancy used by these replicate communication paths also provides a use of the additional bandwidth provided by the high speeds of the problem domain. <p> In addition, there are analogues in thermodynamics and its relationship to quantum mechanics, beyond the existing analogue of information as negative entropy <ref> [ToFa89, ToFa90] </ref> 1 2 5. PLAN OF ACTION The research proposed for Mirage has several facets, each complementing and extending the others. As an extension to Shannons communication theory, it will provide a concrete underpinning for futher research in protocols where latency is a distinguishing factor.

Reference-contexts: Mirage also indicates a stability condition, where network information is conventionally or entropically stable. This stability criterion forms the contraint which the model optimizes communication over <ref> [ToFa90] </ref> Mirage works with three types of information, introducing the third to protocol models. <p> In addition, there are analogues in thermodynamics and its relationship to quantum mechanics, beyond the existing analogue of information as negative entropy <ref> [ToFa89, ToFa90] </ref> 1 2 5.
