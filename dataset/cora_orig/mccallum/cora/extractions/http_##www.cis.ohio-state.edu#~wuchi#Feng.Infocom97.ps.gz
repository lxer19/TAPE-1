Abstract: The transfer of prerecorded, compressed video requires multimedia services to support large uctuations in bandwidth requirements on multiple time scales. Bandwidth smoothing techniques can reduce the burstiness of a variable-bit-rate stream by prefetching data at a series of fixed rates, simplifying the allocation of resources in video servers and the communication network. Given a fixed client-side prefetch buffer, several bandwidth smoothing algorithms have been introduced that are provably optimal under certain constraints. This paper presents a collection of metrics for comparing these smoothing algorithms and evaluating their cost-performance trade-offs. Due to the scarcity of available trace data, we have constructed a video capture testbed and generated a collection of twenty full-length, motion-JPEG encoded video clips. Using these video traces and a range of client buffer sizes, we investigate the interplay between the performance metrics through simulation experiments. The results highlight the unique strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Many emerging multimedia applications, such as digital libraries and video-on-demand services, rely on the efficient transfer of prerecorded video. Effective compression techniques, such as MPEG <ref> [1] </ref> and motion-JPEG, can substantially reduce the resource requirements for storing and transmitting video streams. However, compressed video traffic typically exhibits significant burstiness on multiple time scales, due to the frame structure of the compression algorithm as well as natural variations within and between scenes [2-4]. <p> For a typical video source, a MPEG encoding would have smaller average frame sizes and larger short-term bursti-ness, due the mixture of interpolated (I), predictive (P), and bidirectional (B) frames <ref> [1] </ref>. A video server could limit the effects of this short-term variation through modest prefetch-ing into a small client buffer. Consequently, the relative performance of bandwidth smoothing algorithms is more sensitive to the medium-term and long-term burstiness in the underlying video stream, particularly for a larger client buffer.

Reference-contexts: Minimizing the number of rate changes can also limit the cost of negotiating with the network <ref> [4] </ref> to reserve link bandwidth for transporting the video stream 2 . Figure 8 compares the CBA, MCBA, 2. To further reduce interaction with the network, each video stream could have a separate reservation plan for allocating network resources along the route to the client.

Reference-contexts: This results in a transmission plan that has the smallest possible peak bandwidth requirement (minimizes max j -r j -) and the minimum number of bandwidth increases <ref> [6] </ref>. A CBA plan does not necessarily have the minimum number of bandwidth decreases, since the algorithm always selects the leftmost starting point, independent of shape of the underow and overow curves.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, we compare four algorithms that create plans that minimize the number of bandwidth increases [5,6], minimize the total number of bandwidth changes <ref> [7] </ref>, minimize the variability of the bandwidth requirements [8], or consist of periodic bandwidth runs [9]. The following section describes these bandwidth smoothing algorithms, with an emphasis on how they strive to optimize these specific metrics. <p> A CBA plan does not necessarily have the minimum number of bandwidth decreases, since the algorithm always selects the leftmost starting point, independent of shape of the underow and overow curves. To minimize the number of rate decreases, the minimum changes bandwidth allocation (MCBA) algorithm <ref> [7] </ref> extends the CBA scheme to perform the linear search operation on all rate changes. This results in a transmission plan with the smallest possible number of rate changes (minimizes m) and the minimum peak bandwidth requirement. <p> Number of bandwidth changes To reduce the complexity of the server and client sites, a bandwidth smoothing algorithm could strive to minimize m, the number of runs in the transmission schedule <ref> [7] </ref>, since each bandwidth change requires the sites to modify the I/O rate for the stream, allowing server and network resources to be allocated on the order of minutes instead of by frame or several frames.

The following section describes these bandwidth smoothing algorithms, with an emphasis on how they strive to optimize these specific metrics. <p> This results in a transmission plan with the smallest possible number of rate changes (minimizes m) and the minimum peak bandwidth requirement. Instead of minimizing m, a bandwidth smoothing algorithm can strive to reduce the variability in the rate requirements across the lifetime of the transmission plan <ref> [8] </ref>; for the remainder of the paper, we refer to this approach as the minimum variability bandwidth allocation (MVBA) algorithm. To adjust to variations in the underlying video stream, the MVBA algorithm initiates bandwidth changes at the leftmost point along the frontier, for both rate increases and rate decreases. <p> To improve the likelihood of successful rate-change operations, the smoothing algorithm can minimize the variability of the bandwidth requirements in each time slot (standard deviation of -c 0 , c 1 , ..., c n-1 -), resulting in a smoother plan <ref> [8] </ref>. Since the video clips have different average rate requirements, varying from 1.51 to 3.95 megabits/seconds, Figure 10 plots the coefficient of variation to normalize the variability metric across different streams. In Figure 10, the MVBA plans have the smallest variability in bandwidth allocations, since the algorithm optimizes this metric.

Reference-contexts: Bandwidth smoothing Bandwidth smoothing can reduce the burstiness of compressed video traffic in a video-on-demand architecture, shown in Figure 1. Video servers typically store prerecorded video on large, fast disks [10-13] and may also include tertiary storage, such as tapes or optical jukeboxes, for holding less frequently requested data <ref> [14] </ref>. A network connects the video servers to the client sites through one or more communication links; the network can help ensure continuous delivery of the smoothed video data by including support for rate or delay guarantees [15,16], based on resource reservation requests from the video server.

Reference-contexts: However, most studies of video transmission techniques evaluate a small number of compressed video clips, due to the scarcity of publicly-available traces. To facilitate a more comprehensive evaluation of the smoothing algorithms, we have generated a library of full-length, motion-JPEG video traces 1 using a PC-based video-capture testbed <ref> [17] </ref>. 3.1. Video capture testbed Efficiently gathering large amounts of video trace data requires hardware support for video compression. The video capture testbed consists of a Pioneer Laser Disc player, a MiroVideo DC1tv capture board, and a Pentium-processor with 32 megabytes of memory. <p> These presentations were filmed with a single, stationary camera focusing on the screen for displaying the speakers transparencies. This results in small bandwidth requirements and low variation in the frame sizes relative to the other videos. Plots for the other video traces are shown in reference <ref> [17] </ref>. 4. Performance comparison Using the traces from the video library, this section compares bandwidth smoothing algorithms based on a collection of performance metrics.
