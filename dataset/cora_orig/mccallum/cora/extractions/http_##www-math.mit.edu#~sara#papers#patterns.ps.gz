Title: PATTERN AVOIDANCE AND RATIONAL SMOOTHNESS OF SCHUBERT VARIETIES  
Author: SARA C. BILLEY 
Abstract: Let w be an element of the Weyl group S n , and let X w be the Schubert variety associated to w in the flag manifold SL n (C )=B. Lakshmibai and Sandhya [14] showed that X w is smooth if and only if w avoids the patterns 4231 and 3412. Using two tests for rational smoothness due to Carrell and Peterson [3], we show that rational smoothness of X w is characterized by pattern avoidance for types B, C and D as well. A key step in the proof of this result is a sequence of rules for factoring the Poincare polynomials for the cohomology ring of X w , generalizing the work of Gasharov [8]. Patterns can also be used to characterize actual smoothness of Schubert varieties.

Reference-contexts: Corollary 1.5.

Any word containing the subsequence 6; 3; 7; 1 does not avoid the pattern 32 41. In particular, w = 8 6 23 7 451 (in one-line notation) does not avoid 32 41. Another way to describe pattern avoidance is with the signed permutation matrices.

Then the number of elements weakly below w in Bruhat order is 1 2 k . Historically, there are several other tests for smoothness in various cases. <p> Let c = n1 1 0 1 d1 and let w 0 = wc 1 , then w 0 n = n so w 0 2 B n1 .

The proof will appear in <ref> [2] </ref> and relies on the characterization of rational smoothness given in Theorem 4.2 and the work of Lakshmibai [13] who has given a basis of the tangent space of a Schubert variety at a T -fixed point in terms of positive roots.

Reference-contexts: Roughly speaking, a Schubert variety is rationally smooth if local Poincare duality holds. Any variety which is smooth is necessarily rationally smooth, however the reverse implication is not true in general. We take the next theorem as the formal definition of rational smoothness. Theorem 1.1. <ref> [3] </ref> For any Weyl group W and any w 2 W , a Schubert variety X w is rationally smooth if and only if either of the following hold: 1. The Poincare polynomial p w (t) is symmetric. 2. <p> The complexity of determining if a signed permutation in B n avoids a finite list of patterns of length 4 is O (n 4 ). It was known that the Poincare polynomial of a smooth (not just rationally smooth) Schubert variety factors according to the heights of certain roots <ref> [3, Sect.5] </ref>. In Section 5, we compare our factored formula for p w (t) with Carrell's formula. In Section 2, we define the Bruhat order and give an equivalent characterization in terms of one-line notation. <p> For example, fl ( 6; 3; 7; 1) = <ref> [ 3; 2; 4; 1] </ref>. Any word containing the subsequence 6; 3; 7; 1 does not avoid the pattern 32 41. In particular, w = 8 6 23 7 451 (in one-line notation) does not avoid 32 41. Another way to describe pattern avoidance is with the signed permutation matrices. <p> Comparing factored formulas In this section, we compare our factorizations for p w (t) if X w is rationally smooth with Carrell's generalization of the Kostant-Macdonald formula. Theorem 5.1. <ref> [3, Sect. 5, Thm. I] </ref> Let W be any Weyl group, w 2 W and assume X w is smooth (not just rationally smooth).

Reference-contexts: Finally, in Section 6 we complete the characterization of smoothness and rational smoothness for Schubert varieties of the classical groups. 2. Characterizing Bruhat order The Bruhat or Bruhat-Chevalley order on a Weyl group is a highly important combinatorial tool for studying Schubert varieties <ref> [4] </ref>. There are several ways to characterize this partial order. We state two methods, the first one holds for all Weyl groups, the second one is specific to the classical groups. <p> For example, fl ( 6; 3; 7; 1) = <ref> [ 3; 2; 4; 1] </ref>. Any word containing the subsequence 6; 3; 7; 1 does not avoid the pattern 32 41. In particular, w = 8 6 23 7 451 (in one-line notation) does not avoid 32 41.

Reference-contexts: S n is generated by the simple reflections i for 1 i n 1 where w i is obtained from w by interchanging positions i and i + 1. For example, if w = 612435, then w 1 is 162435.

Reference-contexts: In [18], Stanley has shown that [ ^ 0; w] has the Peck property, namely it is rank symmetric, rank unimodal and k-Sperner for all k.

X w is rationally smooth if and only if the poset [ ^ 0; w] has the Peck property.
