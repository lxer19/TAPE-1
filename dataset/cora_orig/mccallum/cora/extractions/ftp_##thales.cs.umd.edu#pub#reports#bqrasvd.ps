Abstract: In this note we consider an iterative algorithm for moving a triangular matrix toward diagonality. The algorithm is related to algorithms for refining rank-revealing triangular decompositions and in a variant form to the QR algorithm. It is shown to converge if there is a sufficient gap in the singular values of the matrix, and the analysis provides a new approximation theorem for singular values and singular subspaces.

Reference-contexts: This iteration arises in two connections. The one that motivated this paper is a refinement step in updating rank-revealing URV and ULV decompositions <ref> [3, 2] </ref>. Here H 0 is a vector, and E 0 is a scalar and the purpose of the iteration is to make H small, so that R 2 is nearer a diagonal matrix. The second connection is with a variant of the (unshifted) QR algorithm for Hermitian matrices.

Reference-contexts: Ordinarily, an off-diagonal perturbation of size H would obliterate singular values smaller than kHk 2 2 . The fact that even the smallest singular values retain their accuracy is a consequence of the block triangularity of the starting matrix, as we shall see in a moment. Second, Wedin ([5], <ref> [4, Theorem V.4.1] </ref>) has given a bound on the perturbation of singular subspaces.
