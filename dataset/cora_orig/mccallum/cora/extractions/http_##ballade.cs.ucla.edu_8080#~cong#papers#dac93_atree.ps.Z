Abstract: In this paper, we study the interconnect design problem under a distributed RC delay model. We study the impact of technology factors on the interconnect designs and present general formulations of the interconnect topology design and wiresiz-ing problems. We show that interconnect topology optimization can be achieved by computing optimal generalized rectilinear Steiner arborescences and we present an efficient algorithm which yields optimal or near-optimal solutions. We reveal several important properties of optimal wire width assignments and present a polynomial time optimal wiresizing algorithm. Extensive experimental results indicate that our approach significantly outperforms other routing methods for high-performance IC and MCM designs. Our interconnect designs reduce the interconnection delays by up to 66% as compared to those by the best known Steiner tree algorithm.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As the VLSI fabrication technology reaches submicron device dimension and gigahertz frequency, interconnection delay has become the dominant factor in determining circuit speed <ref> [1] </ref>. Most previous works on the interconnect design problem are based on a simplistic linear delay model of wirelength minimization, and many global routing algorithms based on the Steiner tree formulation have been proposed, such as [2, 11]. <p> However, as the technology advances to smaller device dimensions, according to the CMOS scaling rule <ref> [1] </ref>, driver resistance decreases while wire resistance increases, which leads to a significant reduction of the resistance ratio. In this case, t 2 (T ) and t 3 (T ) can no longer be ignored in the design of next-generation VLSI circuits.

Reference-contexts: Most previous works on the interconnect design problem are based on a simplistic linear delay model of wirelength minimization, and many global routing algorithms based on the Steiner tree formulation have been proposed, such as <ref> [2, 11] </ref>. Although these methods produce good results in term of wirelength minimization, they cannot achieve performance optimization in the design of high-speed ICs and MCMs. Moreover, uniform wire width has been used for the connections of most signal nets in the conventional routing methods.

Reference-contexts: In [10], a hierarchical approach to timing-driven routing was outlined. In [12], a timing-driven global router based on the A* heuristic search algorithm was proposed in building-block designs. In <ref> [3] </ref>, a timing-driven global router was proposed to minimize both the total wirelength and the longest path from the source to any sink simultaneously. <p> Therefore, we prefer a routing tree of short paths in order to keep t 3 (T ) small. This, in fact, justifies the work by Cong, et al. <ref> [3] </ref> in which the radius (i.e. the longest source-sink path) of a routing tree is kept under certain bound in the layout design. <p> BRBC-0.5 and BRBC-1.0 are two parameterized versions of the BRBC algorithm with the control parameters * chosen to be 0.5 and 1.0, respectively. In all cases the runtime of the A-tree algorithm is less than 0.3 seconds. Cong et al. <ref> [3] </ref>. The average delay and wirelength are compared in Table 1. The average delay of each net is obtained by averaging the signal delay at every sink using the two-pole circuit simulator developed by Zhou et al. [16].

Reference-contexts: Solutions to the interconnect topology design and wiresizing problems will be discussed in Section 3 and 4 respectively. Due to the length restriction, we omit all proofs of the theorems presented in the next two sections. The reader may refer to <ref> [4] </ref> for details. 3 Interconnect Topology Design Since the general M DRT problem is NP-hard and there is no definite correlation between the three terms t 1 (T ), t 2 (T ), and t 3 (T ) for a general interconnect topology, we shall focus our attention on a special <p> There are several reasons that we are interested in A-trees. First, any A-tree is always a SPT. Therefore, the term t 2 (T ) is always minimum. Moreover, we show in <ref> [4] </ref> that an optimal Steiner A-tree (OSA) is also a quadratic minimum Steiner A-tree (QM SA) in most cases. Therefore, minimizing t 1 (T ) is equivalent to minimizing t 3 (T ). <p> In our algorithm, we introduce three types of moves called safe moves: The first type of move combines two arborescences into a new one, and the second and third types of moves grow an existing arborescence. Detailed descriptions of the safe moves are in <ref> [4] </ref>. We have shown that all three types of safe moves are optimal moves. Therefore, an A-tree constructed using the safe moves is an optimal OSA. Moreover, we have shown that an A-tree constructed using the safe moves is also an optimal QMSA. <p> In this case, we need to perform a heuristic move, a move that may not be optimal. Two types of heuristic moves are used in our algorithm, and both of them heuristically combine two arbores-cences into a new one. The reader may refer to <ref> [4] </ref> for details of the complete A-tree algorithm. <p> Despite its greedy nature, GREWSA performs very well in terms of the quality of assignments and runtime (see Section 5). In fact, GREWSA generates optimal assignments when there are only two choices of wire widths <ref> [4] </ref>. Given two wire width assignments f and f 0 on the same tree T , we say f - f 0 if w (f; S i ) w (f 0 ; S i ) for all S i * T .

Reference-contexts: Section 5.1 shows the improvement achieved by the A-tree and wiresizing algorithms over existing routing algorithms, and Section 5.2 shows the impact of resistance ratio and transistor sizing. 5.1 Effect of Interconnect Topology Opti mization and Wiresizing The results in this section are based on a typical MCM technology 4 <ref> [5] </ref>. We tested our algorithms on signal nets of 4, 8, and 16 sinks. For each net size, 100 nets were generated on a 100 mm x 100 mm routing region for the MCM technology. The grid resolution is 25 m per unit-grid-length.

Reference-contexts: As a result, there is a strong need for systematic studies in the interconnect topology design and wiresizing problems for delay optimization in high-performance system designs.

In <ref> [6] </ref>, net priorities are determined based on static timing analysis; nets with high priorities are processed earlier using fewer feedthroughs. In [10], a hierarchical approach to timing-driven routing was outlined. In [12], a timing-driven global router based on the A* heuristic search algorithm was proposed in building-block designs.

Reference-contexts: There are several reasons that we choose this delay model: (i) Although this model is simpler than the commonly used Elmore delay model <ref> [7] </ref> for distributed RC circuits, it still captures the distributed nature of the circuit; (ii) It gives an accurate upper bound of signal delay at every node and correlates very well with the Elmore delay [14]; (iii) It is much easier to use for interconnect design optimization since it gives a

Reference-contexts: Moreover, none of these algorithms studies the impact of wiresizing on interconnect delay minimization. Although wiresizing was used by Fisher and Kung <ref> [8] </ref> in H-tree clock routing, the general wiresizing problem for arbitrary routing topology has not been well studied before.

Reference-contexts: For each net size, 100 nets were generated on a 100 mm x 100 mm routing region for the MCM technology. The grid resolution is 25 m per unit-grid-length. We have compared the generalized A-tree algorithm with the 1-Steiner algorithm proposed by Kahng and Robins <ref> [9] </ref>, and the bounded-radius-bounded-cost (BRBC) algorithm proposed by 4 Specifics of the MCM technology file: driver resistance = 25 ; wire resistance = 0.008 =m; loading capacitance = 1000 f F ; wire capacitance = 0.060 f F=m; wire inductance = 380 f H=m; total area = 100 mm x 100 <p> In fact, the two-pole simulator computes the Elmore delay when the given circuit is a RC circuit. The 1-Steiner algorithm is one of the best known Steiner heuristics <ref> [9] </ref> and it is not surprising that it has the best wire-length. However, the experimental results show that wirelength minimization does not necessarily lead to minimum delay. In fact, the reduction in the SPT and QMST cost by the A-tree algorithm offsets the wirelength advantage of the 1-Steiner algorithm.

Reference-contexts: If node k is a sink, then C k is the loading capacitance at the node. If node k is a via, it can also be formulated by adding some extra capacitance at the node <ref> [16] </ref>, which reflects the distributed nature of interconnection delay. For simplicity, we assume that C k is non-zero only when node k is a sink, but wire capacitance C 0 is present at every node. <p> Cong et al. [3]. The average delay and wirelength are compared in Table 1.
