Reference-contexts: Let the state space be R n and let the state be observable. The control space U is finite. The system is given as x (k + 1) = A j (k) x (k) + B j (k) u (k); j (k) 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref> and u (k) 2 R m Let a = A j + B j K a : Then the system is given as x (k + 1) = F a (k) x (k): The objective of control is to achieve state deadbeat response in a finite number of <p> For hybrid systems in general there may not be a decision procedure to verify such a property. However, there are subclasses of hybrid systems that are decidable. We consider three such subclasses, Timer Region Automata, Suspension Automata, and Rectangular Automata. Timer region automata described by Alur, Courcoubetis, and Dill <ref> [1] </ref> constitute a decidable subclass of hybrid systems. They are obtained by imposing the following constraints on the hybrid automaton model. 1. <p> Example 2.2: Consider a hybrid system consisting of a single discrete state q and a single self-loop edge e. This is shown in Figure 2.2. The continuous state space is R. The dynamics in q are given as _x = 0. X e = <ref> [1; 1] </ref> and r e (x) = 2x. Then, N k (X H ) = [ 1 2 k ] and X fl = f0g. <p> Thus, the condition of Fact 2.2 is sufficient but not necessary. Example 2.3: Consider the hybrid system H shown in Figure 2.3. Then X H = (<ref> [1; 1] </ref>; [1; 1]) T ; 1 ; 2 X fl = N (X H ): 26 Now consider the infinite path p = e 1 ; e 1 ; e 1 ; : : : Then n p k (X e 1 ) = [ 2 k ; 2 k ]: The <p> For simplicity assume that the tree is binary and assume that each left branch is assigned the value 0 and each right branch is assigned the value 1.

Suppose that for each distance k from the root, subtrees under a nonzero number of prefixes are not replaced. <p> Let the initial e 1 denote the "decimal" point.

Reference-contexts: The controller uses a control law so that the desired behavior is guaranteed with a specified confidence. In our development, we are concerned with viable control of nondeterministic hybrid systems. Some results on viability theory are given by Aubin <ref> [2] </ref>. The approaches of optimal control and stochastic control are frequently combined (see Kumar and Varaiya [13]). Similarly, the approaches of viable control and stochastic control can also be combined (see Kurzhansky [14]).

Reference-contexts: However, condition (3) prohibits such a model in the class of decidable Rectangular Automata. A significant shortcoming of automata-based verification algorithms is that of state space explosion. To overcome this limitation, techniques such as step-wise refinement of the state space (see Balarin <ref> [3] </ref>), or syntactic model-checking (see Henzinger [12]) are employed. 1.4 Some Salient Concepts A few of the ideas that we have developed for hybrid control seem useful for other fields as well. These ideas are captured in our definition of control strategy, three-way partitioning of controls, and syntactic control.

Reference-contexts: We note that the resource allocation function corresponds to the continuous behavior of the corporation. In the portfolio planning function, the corporation determines which business units to promote, which to protect, and which to liquidate. For this analysis, the BCG growth-share matrix <ref> [4] </ref> is often used.

Reference-contexts: In the syntactic approach, the development proceeds through symbolic manipulation of given descriptions using the axioms and the inference rules of the formalism. In the semantic approach, the development proceeds through construction of models that interpret the given descriptions (see Chang and Keisler <ref> [5] </ref> for Model Theory). For example, suppose that you have asked for directions to go to a certain place.

Reference-contexts: The period depends on the initial conditions. Note that checking the second part of condition (2) is not trivial. Further, bounds on the period and on the number of iterations required for the system to commence periodic behavior are not given. Delchamps <ref> [7] </ref> considers a discrete time one-dimensional linear system with quantized observations and continuous controls.

Reference-contexts: The complexity of the automaton approach in the corresponding case, assuming full synchronization of events amongst subsystems, is O (N 1 N p (M 1 M d ) 2 ): We have implemented a software tool called Sy-Control based on this syntactic technique; this is reported by Deshpande and Varaiya <ref> [8] </ref>. 1.5 Applications of Hybrid Control Now we describe three applications of hybrid control theory in the areas of process control, automated vehicle and highway systems, and corporate planning. Clearly, each of these areas is immensely complex and several control approaches must be combined to address them.

Reference-contexts: Robustness also is desirable, i.e., the communication and control mechanisms should adapt to unforeseen circumstances. Thus, the control system must maximize performance under the constraints of safety and robustness. We describe from the perspective of hybrid systems a scenario analyzed by Godbole and Lygeros <ref> [11] </ref>. Consider a car that is following the car ahead of it at the same speed and with a safe distance in between.

Similarly, the approaches of viable control and stochastic control can also be combined (see Kurzhansky <ref> [14] </ref>). When the condition for optimality is relaxed so that any control trajectory with cost close to optimal is permitted, then the approaches of optimal control and viable control (or all three approaches) can be combined.

Reference-contexts: In section 3.4 we give an application of syntactic control. In section 3.5 we validate the syntactic procedure using semantic techniques. 3.1 The PLTL Formalism The syntax of Propositional Linear Temporal Logic (PLTL) (Emerson [9], Manna and Pnueli <ref> [15] </ref>) is given over the following symbols: names for a finite set P of atomic propositions, logical connectives : (not), ^ (and), and temporal connectives fl (next) 1 , U (until). <p> If is controllable to then ~ f ^ ^ is said to be the rule for a control strategy for and . Since PLTL is decidable, standard proof systems (see Manna and Pnueli <ref> [15] </ref>) can be used to determine whether a wff is tautologically false. Now we describe an example of syntactic control. Consider a hungry engineer with an uncooked potato, a pot of water, and a heater. He wishes to eat a soft potato. <p> _ (:h ^ :b ^ :s) _ ((hU (bU s)) ^ (TU s)) Since f 00 is controllable, we obtain ~ f = (:h ^ :b ^ :s) _ ((hU s) ^ (TU s)): Forming ~ f ^ ^ and using standard inference schemas for PLTL (see Manna and Pnueli <ref> [15] </ref>), we get hU s as the rule for the control strategy that the engineer should follow. Condition for Fairness Fairness is a property of the plant-specification pair (; ) promising the existence of a controller such that the closed loop behavior of the system is desired.

Reference-contexts: To show this, it is demonstrated that the discrete event traces in L b H induce a finite equivalence partition (see Definition 1.1) of the continuous state space R n . The regions of this partition are called timer regions, whence this class derives its name. McManis and Varaiya <ref> [16] </ref> have extended the timer region automaton model to permit clock variables with rates 0 or 1, i.e., _x i = 0 or _x i = 1: 13 The general class of such systems is undecidable.

Reference-contexts: The control systems literature in each of these areas is vast and we make no attempt to survey it here. Nerode and Kohn [19] give an approach to optimal control of hybrid systems. Mortazavian <ref> [17] </ref> gives an approach to stochastic control of hybrid systems. 1.2.2 The Information Structure The information structure of a control system specifies what the controller can observe, what it can control, and its knowledge of how the plant responds to the applied control law.

Reference-contexts: The corporation itself performs two functions: in the short term it allocates corporate resources (e.g., cash) to the business units, and in the long term it makes portfolio investment decisions. Naylor <ref> [18] </ref>, Rosenkranz [23] describe typical corporate planning models. It is usual to consider each business unit in terms of its production model and its marketing model. The production model is a map that transforms a stream of factor inputs (typically, capital and labour) into a stream of product outputs.

Reference-contexts: It is usual to consider each business unit in terms of its production model and its marketing model. The production model is a map that transforms a stream of factor inputs (typically, capital and labour) into a stream of product outputs. In the theory of the firm (see Varian <ref> [26] </ref>) such a map is called technology. Note that in our setup we include system dynamics. Similarly, the marketing model is a map that transforms a stream of inputs (typically, advertisement expenditures and market analysis skills) into a stream of market parameter identifications (i.e., demand characteristics and 20 competitive position).
