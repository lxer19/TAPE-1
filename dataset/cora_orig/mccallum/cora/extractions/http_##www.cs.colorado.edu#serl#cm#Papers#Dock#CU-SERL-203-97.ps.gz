Abstract: Software distribution is evolving from a physical media approach to one where it is practical and advantageous to leverage the connectivity of networks. Network distribution of software systems provides timeliness and continuous evolution that is not possible with physical media distribution methods. To support network-based software distribution, companies and organizations such as Microsoft, Marimba, and the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF) are strengthening their efforts to package software systems in a way that is conducive to network distribution. The result of these efforts has led to the creation of software description languages and schema, such as the Open Software Description (OSD) format created by Microsoft and Marimba and the Management Information Format (MIF) created by DMTF. This paper explores software system description languages and schema by introducing the software deployment life cycle. Using the software deployment life cycle as a guide, the issues and requirements of a language or schema intended to support software deployment are discussed. Both OSD and MIF are then presented and critiqued with regards to their ability to support the software deployment life cycle.
