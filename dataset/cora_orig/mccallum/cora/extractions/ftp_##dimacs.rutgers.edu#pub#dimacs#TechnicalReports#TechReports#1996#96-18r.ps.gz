Reference-contexts: This convex programming problem can be solved in O (n 4 log (2 l nR=*)) iterations of the ellipsoid method (see, e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>), where each iteration requires O (n 2 (m + n)) arithmetic operations over log (2 l nR=*)-bit numbers. Hence, we obtain an upper bound of lmn O (minfm;n 2 g) operations with ln O (minfm;n 2 g) -bit numbers for testing the feasibility of (1).
