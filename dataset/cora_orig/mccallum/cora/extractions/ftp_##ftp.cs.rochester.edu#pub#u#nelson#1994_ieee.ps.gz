Abstract: The recognition of human movements such as walking, running or climbing has been approached previously by tracking a number of feature points and either classifying the trajectories directly or matching them with a high-level model of the movement. A major difficulty with these methods is acquiring and tracking the requisite feature points, which are generally specific joints such as knees or ankles. This requires previous recognition and/or part segmentation of the actor. In this paper, we show that the recognition of walking or any repetitive motion activity can be accomplished on the basis of bottom up processing, which does not require the prior identification of specific parts, or classification of the actor. In particular, we demonstrate that repetitive motion is such a strong cue, that the moving actor can be segmented, normalized spatially and temporally, and recognized by matching against a spatiotemporal template of motion features. We have implemented a real-time system that can recognize and classify repetitive motion activities in normal grayscale image sequences.

Reference-contexts: Such abilities suggest that, in the case of machine vision, it might be possible to use motion as a means of recognition directly, rather than indirectly through a geometric reconstruction. Human motion, specifically walking, has been studied extensively using model-based approaches (for ex ample <ref> [ Hoffman and Flinchbuagh, 1982 ] </ref> ). Rashid [ 1980 ] addresses the problem of correspondence of the points in an MLD sequence between successive frames and obtaining trajectories of those points.

Reference-contexts: Humans have a remarkable ability to recognize different kinds of motion, both of discrete objects, such as animals or people, and in distributed patterns as in windblown leaves, or waves on a pond. The classic demonstration of pure motion recognition by humans is provided by Moving Light Display experiments <ref> [ Johansson, 1973 ] </ref> , where human subjects were able to distinguish activities such as walking, running or stair climbing, from lights attached to the joints of an actor. More subtle movement characteristics can be distinguished as well.

Reference-contexts: The resulting gray-level image sequence consists of the activity at a constant distance from camera while the actor remains stationary in the image frame. We com bine this with earlier reported methods <ref> [ Polana and Nelson, 1994a ] </ref> , [ Polana and Nelson, 1994b ] for detecting stationary activities and classifying them to obtain a real-time implementable system of activity recognition. <p> Temporal scale invariance is achieved by detecting the frequency of the activity and obtaining one cycle of activity by averaging motion information of multiple cycles. A more complete discussion of the periodicity detection and frequency estimation can be found in <ref> [ Polana and Nelson, 1994a ] </ref> . Temporal translation has turned out to be hard to estimate from the motion information, but it was handled in the matching stage by matching the test template with reference template at all possible temporal translations. <p> According to the definition of a periodic activity, for each fixed (x; y), the signal M (x; y; t) over time should be periodic. For each (x; y), we compute the periodicity index as described in <ref> [ Polana and Nelson, 1994a ] </ref> and combine the individual periodicity indices to get a periodicity measure for the whole image frame. By thresholding the resulting periodicity measure it is possible to determine if the motion produced by the object is periodic.
