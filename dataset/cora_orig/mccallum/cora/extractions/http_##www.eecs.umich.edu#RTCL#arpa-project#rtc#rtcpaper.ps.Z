Reference-contexts: The performance of these algorithms is demonstrated mainly by simulation using certain stochastic arrival and deadline patterns. On the other hand, when the system has some information about the arrival pattern of messages, it can try to give guarantees about their delivery times. For example, Strosnider and Marchok <ref> [5] </ref> use a variation of the rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm to control access to a token-ring network. They assign priorities at design time to message sources based on the periodicity of message generation and they can check for the possibility of deadline overrun at that time.

Reference-contexts: The system consists of processor nodes connected by point-to-point dual simplex links. A node in the system can have several incoming and outgoing links connected to it, and these links can operate in parallel (as in <ref> [10] </ref>). The nodes run a common distributed real-time operating system which is responsible for control of the network. <p> We also presented mechanisms for buffer allocation and flow control suitable for real-time channels, which would preserve the guarantees on delivery time. Using the ideas presented here, we are currently building a prototype communication subsystem for a distributed real-time system, called HARTS <ref> [10, 24] </ref>, which is being developed at the Real-Time Computing Laboratory, The University of Michigan.

C-39, </volume> <pages> pp. 514-524, </pages> <month> Apr. </month> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: The operating system also synchronizes clocks and maintains a global time-base for the system, where the maximum skew between clocks on different nodes is very small compared to the end-to-end message delivery delay. A scheme for achieving this synchronization is presented in <ref> [11] </ref>. 4 September 9, 1993 Communication between user-level entities in this system can either be connection-oriented or connectionless. In the connection-oriented case, it can be either message stream or byte stream oriented. <p> This definition of the logical arrival time is feasible because the nodes in the system have synchronized clocks and the maximum skew between clocks on different nodes is small compared to the message delivery delays <ref> [11] </ref>. Alternatively, it is conceivable to define ` c;b (m i ) based only on the observed arrival time of messages at node b, without carrying any timestamps in the packet headers. However, this type of scheme has problems when we consider multiple-packet messages.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we use static routing for messages belonging to real-time channels. We will assume that a route has been selected for the channel, possibly using a scheme like the one presented in <ref> [15] </ref>, and concentrate on the computation of guarantees and on buffer management. The worst-case delay for a message at a link depends upon the scheduling algorithm used and the other channels which use the link.

Reference-contexts: The message deadline may be related to its period, but it is not necessarily the beginning of the next period. There are several approaches to scheduling these messages, which can be categorized as fixed priority or dynamic priority algorithms. For example, Earliest Due Date <ref> [16] </ref> is a dynamic priority algorithm, whereas rate monotonic scheduling [17] is a fixed priority algorithm. We will now discuss the problems associated with the use of these algorithms for message scheduling and channel establishment. <p> Hence, when arrivals are all periodic and conform to the inter-arrival time constraints, a feasible schedule based on priorities exists. Dertouzos <ref> [16] </ref> has shown that this implies the existence of a feasible EDD schedule for this message set, which is based on the deadlines assigned to the channels.

We will now discuss the problems associated with the use of these algorithms for message scheduling and channel establishment. <p> We will now discuss the problems associated with the use of these algorithms for message scheduling and channel establishment. Deadline Scheduling: The Earliest Due Date (EDD) algorithm schedules messages in the order of their deadlines, with higher priority given to messages which have closer deadlines. Liu and Layland <ref> [17] </ref> have shown that EDD is optimal for preemptive scheduling of periodic tasks when the task deadline is equal to the beginning of its next period, and that a feasible schedule exists whenever the total utilization is less than one. <p> This is done by computing the worst-case response time for each message using a critical time zone analysis similar to the one used by Liu and Layland <ref> [17] </ref>, and verifying that the worst-case response time is less than the delay assigned to that channel. The details of this scheme for analysis can be found in Appendix A. <p> Lemma 1 proves that the priority assignment based on delays is optimal in the sense that if there is any feasible priority assignment for the channel set, there is a feasible priority assignment based on delays. This is in fact a generalization of the optimality result for rate-monotonic scheduling <ref> [17] </ref>. In their model, Liu and Layland assumed that the deadline for an instance of a periodic task is the release time of the next instance, that is, d i = p i .

Reference-contexts: The optimality result for this scheduling algorithm can be derived from Lemma 1 by substituting d i = p i ; 8i.

Reference-contexts: We do not consider statistical channels mainly because hard real-time applications require absolute guarantees. Comer and Yavatkar have developed an abstraction called flows <ref> [19] </ref>, which is similar to a unidirectional channel, but they do not give guarantees for the delivery time of messages. Flows can be identified with best-effort channels.

Reference-contexts: Limited buffering can result in packet loss, and so their efforts are aimed at maximizing throughput, while keeping the probability of packet loss below a certain level. Another approach to this problem is the "stop-and-go" queueing framework proposed by Golestani <ref> [22, 23] </ref>. In this approach, a framing technique is used at all switching nodes to eliminate packet loss and to achieve a guaranteed end-to-end delay. However, the end-to-end delay is tied to the sizes of the frames, thus reducing the flexibility of satisfying different delay requirements.
