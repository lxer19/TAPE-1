Abstract: This RFCconsiders certain deficiencies of the 1988 X.500 standard, which need to be addressed before an effective open Internet Directory can be established using these protocols and services [CCI88]. The only areas considered are primary problems, to which solutions must be found before a pilot can be deployed. This RFCconcerns itself with deficiencies which can only be addressed by use of additional protocol or procedures for distributed operation.

Reference-contexts: 1 Distributed Operation Extensions The Internet Directory will operate DSAs over TCP/IP using RFC 1006 <ref> [RC87] </ref>, and DSAs over the an ISO Network Service. Distributed operation procedures should not require full connectivity. 2 Knowledge Replication Knowledge information is critical to resolution of names, and performing searches. Knowledge information high up the tree needs to be widely available. Consider resolving a name below "Country=US".
