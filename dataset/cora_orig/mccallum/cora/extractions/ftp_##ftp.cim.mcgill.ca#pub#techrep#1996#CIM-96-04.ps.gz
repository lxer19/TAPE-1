Reference-contexts: In fact, some of the proofs given herein are not directly applicable to the n = 2 case! The notation and results on polytopes largely follows the text <ref> [3] </ref> by A. Brtndsted. In addition to setting forth the basic notations and results on polytopes, we will develop an important result on polytopes (Theorem 3.27) within this section. <p> Lemma 3.4: A non-empty, bounded polyhedral set is a polytope. Proof: See <ref> [3, p. 56] </ref>. ffi We are interested in the facial structure of these polytopes. <p> A n-polytope is simple that for k = 0; 1; : : : ; n 1, the number of facets containing any k-face is n k. In fact, the n-polytope is simple if and only if each vertex is contained in precisely n facets ([3, Theorem 12.11]). Theorem 3.5: <ref> [3, Theorem 16.16] </ref> If is a simple n-polytope, then for 0 j k n, there are precisely n k k-faces containing a given j-face of . 3 These intersection properties are used throughout the algorithm development. <p> Proof: This is taken from <ref> [3, Theorem 8.2] </ref>. ffi Lemma 3.14: For all x 2 R n , x 2 U ff if and only if U 0 x ff: Hence, if ff ff + , then the ext-representations U ff ; U ff + are such that U ff U ff + . <p> Then note that there exists some 2-face F fl such that x fl 2 F fl (either a subset or equal to one of these facets). Then, by <ref> [3, Theorem 7.7] </ref>, there exists an edge E fl of U ff such that F fl = conv (x fl S E fl ). It easy to see that this edge E fl is a subset of F i .

Reference-contexts: If one uses the incremental gain generalisation of that norm, one can use relatively easily computed linear matrix inequalities ([7]). If the induced norm generalisation is used, partial differential inequalities over R n result (for example, see <ref> [5] </ref>). A difficulty with the practical use of partial differential inequalities is that they generally have been solved using finite difference schemes. This requires the imposition of a grid of points over R n , with a corresponding large growth in computational effort as the state dimension rises.

Reference-contexts: The results for the R 2 case can be shown as geometric proofs, and are much easier to visualise. As such, the report <ref> [6] </ref> is aimed to be used for tutorial purposes. In [6], the saturating system: _x (t) = :333 :86 2:27 0 ([:3564 :284]x (t)) ; was used as an example. (The function 0 () is the standard saturation function: 0 (x) = x if jxj &lt; 1, sign (x) otherwise.)
