Abstract: Hypertext is an appealing interface for digital libraries, but using existing paper documents to build such a library poses several challenges. We describe a system for creating hypertext links on the fly in a library composed of bitmapped images of paper documents and text derived from those images by optical-character recognition. We present two simple ideas: text-image maps coordinate text and image representations of a document, and our probabilistic search heuristics generate hypertext links from the text of citations. Using the WorldWide Web, we built an interface that lets readers move from a bibliography entry to the cited document with a mouse click. Similarly, readers can click on entries in the table of contents and move directly to them. INT RODUC TION This paper describes an ongoing research effort to support the use of bitmapped images as the primary storage and presentation format of future digital libraries. Using images simplifies the task of creating computerized libraries of already-printed texts, but poses other complications. In particular, many tasks we expect to perform with a digital library require that the computer be able to manipulate the text of the document. The use of bitmapped images also poses problems for one of the most basic uses of a digital library: following a reference from one document to another. A user is browsing a document looking at images of the document pages and discovers a reference to another work that is potentially of interest. The user highlights the reference with his or her mouse and clicks a button; the document that was referenced appears in a new window on the users screen. The preceding vision of a digital library a collection of page images with a hypertext-like interface is due to Saltzer [8]. Our work examines some of the issues involved in implementing this vision. The use of images as the primary data format gives rise to a common question. What is the advantage of images over Postscript or SGML or some other format? We see two primary motivations for page images. First, images are a good format for long-term, archival storage for three primary reasons: The second reason we choose images is that we have focused on the task of creating a digital library to complement existing libraries and that means creating electronic versions of the millions of already-existing paper documents. The Library 2000 project plans to scan in all of MITs computer science technical reports. Changes in disk, network, and display technology are rapidly making it feasible to build a large library of digital images, but the problem we address is the software support that will be needed to build hypertext documents with images. First, we describe text-image maps that allow users to treat images the same way they would treat text when they highlight regions and select references. Second, we use those text-image maps to generate hypertext links between documents on-the-fly. Several other digital library projects have used images to display documents, including CORE [2], Dienst [6], RightPages [3], and TULIP [7]. Our work is different primarily because it focuses on a closer integration between text and image than has been reported before; we link text and image at the word level instead of the paragraph level. Also, much of the published work on CORE and RightPages discusses image processing and recognition, which we do not deal with. TEXT-IMAGE MAPS We manage documents in two distinct formats, bitmapped images of individual pages and a text version of those pages that includes information about the position and appearance of the text on the page. Almost any operation that user would perform highlighting a section of text or moving from the table of contents to a particular chapter makes use of both representations of a document. When a user sees an interesting reference and wants to get a copy, he clicks on it; the system will receive the coordinates of the users mouse click. Before the system can attempt to locate the document the user wants, it must use the image coordinates to locate the actual text that the user clicked on. Once this text is located, the system can use the search heuristics we describe to find the document cited.
