Reference-contexts: In MEL2, only two these four orientations are permitted. Chong and Sahni showed that MEL4 is NP-hard even for a single row or column of modules. They developed polynomial time algorithms for restricted versions of MEL4 and obtained an O (nlogn) algorithm for MEL2. In <ref> [AHN92] </ref>, we obtained the following results for module orientation problems: 1. The MaxDelay problem is that of reorienting the modules so that the length of the longest signal flow path is minimized.

Reference-contexts: Experimental results reported by them indicate this heuristic is superior to the neural network approach of [LIBE89]. The problem of minimizing the maximum estimated wire length was studied by Chong and Sahni <ref> [CHON91] </ref>. They considered two versions of the problem MEL4 and MEL2. In MEL4 each module is permitted four orientations as in Figure 1. In MEL2, only two these four orientations are permitted. Chong and Sahni showed that MEL4 is NP-hard even for a single row or column of modules.

Reference-contexts: Yamada and Liu [YAMA88] propose an analytical method to obtain suboptimal solutions for ETLF. This algorithm is shown (experimentally) to be competitive with hill-climbing and simulated annealing algorithms for ETLF. In [LIBE89], Libeskind-Hadas and Liu propose neural network formulations for ETLF and ETLR. Chong and Sahni <ref> [CHON92] </ref> show that ETLF is linearly solvable for the case when the modules are arranged as a matrix in which wires connect only pairs of modules that are in adjacent columns. <p> They also show that ETLF is polynomially solvable for standard cell designs in which wires connect modules in adjacent columns and either the number of module columns is two or the number of modules dependent on any other module is bounded by some constant. Chong and Sahni <ref> [CHON92] </ref> also evaluate a simple greedy heuristic that attempts to minimize ETL by flipping modules. Experimental results reported by them indicate this heuristic is superior to the neural network approach of [LIBE89]. The problem of minimizing the maximum estimated wire length was studied by Chong and Sahni [CHON91].

Reference-contexts: However, modules of different size are used. Our proof applies to the simpler layout of equal size modules into a single row or single column. 2 NP-hard Results To prove our NP-hard results, we use the following problem that is known to be NP-hard: NE3SAT problem <ref> [GARE79] </ref> Input: A Boolean function I = C 1 , C 2 , ..., C m in n variables x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n . Each clause C i is the disjunction of exactly three literals.

Reference-contexts: Let ETL denote the estimated total wire length and let MEL denote the maximum estimated wire length (i.e., length of the longest wire). The problems of minimizing ETL and MEL by flipping modules have been studied by Yamada and Lin [YAMA88], Libeskind-Hadas and Liu <ref> [LIBE89] </ref>, and Chong and Sahni [CHON91 and 92]. All of these start with a preplaced circuit. It is assumed that modules may be flipped about their horizontal and/or vertical axes. Hence, there are four possible orientations of a module under flipping (Figure 1). <p> In both [YAMA88] and <ref> [LIBE89] </ref>, the Euclidean distance between wire end points is used to estimate wire length. Both ETLF and ETLR are shown to be NP-hard in [LIBE89].

The ETLF problem is NP-hard for a single column of equal size modules even when only vertical flips are permitted. Note that he ETLF proof of <ref> [LIBE89] </ref> uses modules of two different sizes. While most of these are placed in a single row arrangement, two modules are stacked into a column. <p> So, our ETLF proof applies to even simpler module layouts than does the proof of <ref> [LIBE89] </ref>. 3. Single column ETLF can be solved in linear time when only horizontal flips are permitted. 4. For the ETLF problem, algorithms to obtain optimal solutions for layouts that follow a module matrix model as well as for standard cell layouts are developed. 5. <p> The ETLR problem is NP-hard for a single column or row of equal size modules even when only 0 and 90 rotations are permitted. Note that the ETLR proof of <ref> [LIBE89] </ref> comes close to having three rows of modules. However, modules of different size are used.
