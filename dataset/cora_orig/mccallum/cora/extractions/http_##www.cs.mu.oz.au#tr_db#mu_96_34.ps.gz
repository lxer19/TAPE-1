Abstract: We address the problem of building environment maps from ultrasonic range data obtained from multiple viewpoints. We present a novel environment mod-elling technique called the `response grid' that allows us to build occupancy maps in highly specular environments. We present three different approaches that utilise this technique: a Bayesian probabilisitic approach, a Dempster-Shafer evidential reasoning approach and a winner-take-all heuristic approach. All three approaches can be implemented in real-time with modest computational resources, and as such are suitable for use in mobile robot navigation tasks. We present and compare the experimental results obtained by these three methods in a highly specular indoor environment.

Reference-contexts: In particular, standard sensors have very poor angular resolution and can generate misleading range values in specular environments. The first of these problems can be largely overcome by combining range measurements from multiple viewpoints. Elfes <ref> [1] </ref> and Moravec [2] describe an approach in which range measurements from multiple viewpoints are combined in a two-dimensional `occupancy grid'. Each cell in 1 the grid is assigned a value indicating the probability that the cell is occupied. <p> We present and compare a Bayesian probabilistic reasoning approach, a Dempster-Shafer evidential reasoning approach and a heursitic winner-take-all approach. The Bayesian approach can be viewed, to some extent, as a generalisation of the approach described by Elfes <ref> [1] </ref> and by Moravec [2]. This earlier work appears as a special case in our approach. The second approach utilises the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidential reasoning to combine evidence. We will see that these first two methods produce very similar results. <p> Note that in the Bayesian map, cell values are always in the range <ref> [0:5; 1] </ref> (the lower bound comes from our choice of prior probabilities it could be set to an arbitrarily low, non-zero value). The Bayesian method we have developed cannot tell us which cells are probably empty, it can only tell us the cells that are probably occupied. <p> Note particularly the n = 1 case, where we are effectively ignoring the response behaviour and attempting to compute cell occupancy directly (the Bayesian n = 1 case corresponds to the method described by Elfes <ref> [1] </ref>). The reason for this fall off is simple the evidence obtained from multiple measurements is contradictory when n is small. Consider a smooth surface for example. A pulse whose angle of incidence on this surface is greater than about 40 ffi will not be reflected back to the sensor.

Reference-contexts: Each cell in 1 the grid is assigned a value indicating the probability that the cell is occupied. Unfortunately, the occupancy grid approach does not work well in specular environments. Specular reflection may occur whenever an ultrasonic pulse encounters a smooth extended surface <ref> [3] </ref>. In such cases the pulse may not be reflected back to the ultrasonic sensor; in effect, the surface may appear to be invisible. In ordinary office environments which contain smooth walls and glass doors specular reflection is common. <p> The pulses propagate through the air, reflect off solid objects and arrive back at the sensor. By timing the interval between the emitted pulse and the returned echo, these devices can measure ranges up to about 10 meters with an accuracy of the order of a few centimeters <ref> [3] </ref>. The difficulty with using these devices is two-fold. Firstly, the broad beam results in very poor angular resolution; the location of the object generating the reflection is known accurately in only one dimension (that along the beam axis).

Reference-contexts: The response grid framework attempts to model the behaviour of ultrasonic range sensors in a more physically realistic fashion. A number of other authors have considered the physical behaviour of such sensors in some detail <ref> [4, 5, 6] </ref>; in this paper, however, we are only conerned with physical behaviour in-so-far as it allows us to generate two dimensional occupancy maps in specular environments. <p> results obtained in a highly specular environment. 2 Framework 2.1 Properties of ultrasonic range finders In order to motivate the discussion to follow, it is important to understand some of the physical properties of ultrasonic range sensors (detailed discussions of the physical properties of such devices can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>). Standard ultrasonic range sensors, such as the widely used Polaroid device, emit a series of short ultrasonic pulses in a beam which is about 20 ffi wide. The pulses propagate through the air, reflect off solid objects and arrive back at the sensor.

Reference-contexts: We will see that these first two methods produce very similar results. To our knowledge, Dempster-Shafer techniques have not previously been applied to ultrasonic map building; they have, however, been applied to the somewhat similar task of building occupancy maps from stereo image pairs <ref> [7] </ref>. The final method we present is based on a simple winner-take-all heuristic for combining evidence. In contrast with the other two methods, this method makes no assumptions about the statistical independence (or otherwise) of repeated measurements.

Reference-contexts: We will postpone discussion of practical implementations of such a map until Section 4, where the implementation of all three methods presented in this paper is considered. 3.2 Method 2: Dempster-Shafer The Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence <ref> [9] </ref> can be applied to our problem in a straight-forward fashion. The objective is to determine the support for the proposition O. <p> If m ( j r 1 ) and m ( j r 1 ) represent mass distributions arising from independent measurements, the combined mass distribution m ( j r 1 ; r 2 ) is given by Dempster's rule <ref> [9] </ref>: m (C j r 1 ; r 2 ) = 1 A"B=C where is defined as = A"B=; and A, B and C are elements of the set fR ; :R ; R _ :R g.
