Reference-contexts: Similarly, no RN C algorithm exists for any P-Complete problem unless P RN C. There has been some previous work on N C-approximation algorithms for P-Complete problems. For example, Anderson and Mayr <ref> [1] </ref> considered the high degree subgraph problem: Given a graph G and an integer k, find the maximum induced subgraph of G in which every node has degree at least k in the subgraph.

Reference-contexts: We will show that this problem is log-space complete for P by reducing a form of the monotone circuit value problem (M CV 2) to AM CF . The reduction is a simple generalization of the proof of Goldschlager, Shaw and Staples <ref> [2] </ref> that the problem of determining the exact value of the maximum flow in a network is log-space complete for P. First we give several necessary definitions and known results. <p> Definition 3.3 M CV 2 is the problem of determining the value of a monotone circuit such that each input has fan-out at most one, each gate has fan-out at most 2, and the last gate, ff 0 , is an OR gate. Theorem 3.4 <ref> [2] </ref> M CV 2 is log-space complete for P. We will now state and prove our main result. Theorem 3.5 AM CF is log-space complete for P. <p> This is because f assigns an even amount of flow to every edge except perhaps (0; t), which is 1 if and only if A outputs true. The proof of <ref> [2] </ref> shows that simulating flow pattern f is maximum, odd, and has exactly one unit of flow on edge (0; t). It follows that any other maximum flow must be odd too.

Reference-contexts: Our theoretical model of parallel computation will be the CRCW PRAM <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> At each step in the algorithm, each processor is allowed to generate an O (log n)-bit random number. The complexity class that corresponds to our notion of difficult to parallelize is the class of P-Complete decision problems <ref> [3] </ref>. Analogous to the N P-Complete problems in their role as the "hardest" problems in the class P, no N C algorithm for any P-Complete problem exists unless P is equal to N C. Similarly, no RN C algorithm exists for any P-Complete problem unless P RN C.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to this result they give an N C algorithm that can approximate the solution within a factor arbitrarily close to 1 2 . A similar result was obtained by Kirousis, Serna and Spirakis <ref> [4] </ref>, who investigated the High Edge-Connectivity Subgraph Problem, and showed it could be approximated in N C within any factor &lt; 1 2 , but producing a better approximation was 2 P-Complete. They also demonstrated the same type of behavior for the vertex-connectivity version of the problem.

Reference-contexts: They also demonstrated the same type of behavior for the vertex-connectivity version of the problem. There have also been several results that show that a certain P-complete problem can not be approximated in N C within any factor unless P = N C <ref> [5, 7] </ref>. The most interesting of these is a recent result by Serna, who proved the P-Completeness of approximating Linear Programming within any factor [6].

Reference-contexts: The most interesting of these is a recent result by Serna, who proved the P-Completeness of approximating Linear Programming within any factor <ref> [6] </ref>. This raises the question of whether the same is true for other P-Complete problems, such as maximum flow or minimum-cost flow, that can be described as combinatorial linear programs.

Reference-contexts: It is unlikely that such a result is true for the maximum-flow problem, since it is known that it can be approximated arbitrarily closely in RN C <ref> [8] </ref>.
