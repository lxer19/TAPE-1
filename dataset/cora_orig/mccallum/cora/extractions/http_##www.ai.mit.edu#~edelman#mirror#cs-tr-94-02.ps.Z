Abstract: How does the brain represent visual objects? In simple perceptual generalization tasks, the human visual system performs as if it represents the stimuli in a low-dimensional metric psychological space (Shepard, 1987). In theories of 3D shape recognition, the role of feature-space representations (as opposed to structural (Biederman, 1987) or pictorial (Ullman, 1989) descriptions) has been for a long time a major point of contention. If shapes are indeed represented as points in a feature space, patterns of perceived similarity among different objects must reflect the structure of this space. The feature space hypothesis can then be tested by presenting subjects with complex parameterized 3D shapes, and by relating the similarities among subjective representations, as revealed in the response data by multidimensional scaling (Shepard, 1980), to the objective parameterization of the stimuli. The results of four such tests, accompanied by computational simulations, support the notion that discrimination among 3D objects may rely on a low-dimensional feature space representation, and suggest that this space may be spanned by explicitly encoded class prototypes.

It would be interesting to reconsider the experimental results usually quoted in support of the geon theory, to determine the extent of their compatibility with the prototype-based model.

Reference-contexts: In the human data, linear separability was absent in experiment 4. Classification based on the MDS-derived configurations. One of the important advantages of dimensionality reduction is the facilitation of learning from examples, which, in turn, allows the system to rely on simple classification methods such as the nearest neighbor <ref> (Duda and Hart, 1973) </ref>. Assuming that the human visual system indeed maintains at some level of processing a low-dimensional representation similar to the 2D pattern obtained by MDS, it would be interesting to assess the utility of this representation for classifying the experimental stimuli.

Reference-contexts: 3.1 Method Common to all three simulations is a bank of k = 200 filters that transduced the images (the same ones seen by the human subjects) into a 200-dimensional Euclidean space, R 200 (the receptive fields of the filters were radially elongated Gaussians, randomly positioned over the image; see <ref> (Edelman, 1992) </ref>). Dissimilarity between pairs of images could then be computed as distance in R 200 (the dissimilarity patterns induced by such representations approach their asymptotic values already for k 150 (Weiss and Edelman, 1993)).

Reference-contexts: Dissimilarity between pairs of images could then be computed as distance in R 200 (the dissimilarity patterns induced by such representations approach their asymptotic values already for k 150 <ref> (Weiss and Edelman, 1993) </ref>). In the first simulation (raw filter model), the distances were entered into a table which was then submitted directly to multidimensional scaling. <p> A more extensive discussion of this approach to representation is beyond the scope of this paper, and may be found in <ref> (Edelman, 1993) </ref>. Varieties of multidimensional models of perception and cognition in which stimuli are encoded by distances to stored pattern distributions have been explored extensively in a number of recent works (Ashby and Perrin, 1988; Ashby, 1992).

Reference-contexts: It is clear that subsequent processing of visual information must involve a massive dimensionality reduction. Although some computational models of recognition explicitly address this point <ref> (Intrator and Gold, 1993) </ref>, the nature of the putative low-dimensional representations that support shape processing in human vision is as yet unknown.

Reference-contexts: Connectionist implementations of categorization in multidimensional feature spaces (Kruschke, 1992; Hanson and Gluck, 1993) tend to resemble in their structure the basis function networks of <ref> (Poggio, 1990) </ref>, as well as the prototype-based approach adopted here. The success of these models in accounting for a range of findings concerning human categorization is, therefore, encouraging.

Reference-contexts: Indirect justification for the assumed dependence of RT on psychological distance may be found in certain computational models of decision making <ref> (Ratcliff, 1981) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Although subjective internal representations are not directly accessible to the experimenter, it may be possible to recover the relationships between the representations of different stimuli from the response data, using multidimensional scaling, or MDS <ref> (Shepard, 1980) </ref>. To determine the configuration of n stimuli using nonmetric MDS, one starts with an n fi n table, in which the value placed at the (i; j)'th entry is monotonically related to the similarity between stimulus i and stimulus j.
