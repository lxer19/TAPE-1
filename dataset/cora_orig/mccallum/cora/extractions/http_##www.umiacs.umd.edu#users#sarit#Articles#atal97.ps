Abstract: We propose a bidding mechanism for data allocation in environments of self-motivated data servers with no common preferences and no central controller. The model considers situations where each server is concerned with the data stored locally, but does not have preferences concerning the exact storage location of data stored in remote servers. We considered situations of complete, as well as incomplete, information, and formally proved that our method is stable and yields honest bids. In the case of complete information, we also proved that the results obtained by the bidding approach are always better than the results obtained by the static allocation policy currently used for data allocation for servers in distributed systems. In the case of incomplete information, we demonstrated, using simulations, that the quality of the bidding mechanism is, on average, better than that of the static policy.

Reference-contexts: That is, bidding the true utility is not in a strong Nash equilibrium <ref> [1] </ref>, since there may be a subgroup of agents which can gain when they deviate together from the suggested strategies. If communication during the bidding process is forbidden, then the servers will not be able to cooperate.

Reference-contexts: The NPV is used in financing systems in order to find the value of an investment. It is computed by discounting the cash flows at the firm's "opportunity cost" of capital <ref> [2] </ref>. We will use the same term for finding the value of a dataset storage, considering the dataset as a possible investment. <p> Otherwise, if s is risk averse, then the uncertainty involved in future queries flows will influence the utility it derives from storing the dataset, so U s will be risk adjusted in order to consider the element of uncertainty involved in its expected profits <ref> [2] </ref>, i.e., U s (ds; loc) &lt; P s (ds; loc). Similarly, if s is risk prone, then U s (ds; loc) &gt; P s (ds; loc).

Reference-contexts: We will discuss the servers' performance in the complete information case, as well as in the incomplete information case. 2 Previous work on file (data) allocation in distributed systems (e.g., <ref> [3] </ref>) considers systems where a central decision maker exists, which tries to maximize the performance of the overall system.

Reference-contexts: If s is risk neutral, i.e., its utility is determined only regarding its expected profits <ref> [4] </ref>, then its utility function is the same as its expected profits, and U s (ds; loc) = P s (ds; loc).

Reference-contexts: In the following sections, we will describe the data allocation problem and suggest a utility function which characterizes the servers' preferences. Then we will suggest a bidding protocol for data allocations, which is a dominant strategy mechanism <ref> [5] </ref>. We will also consider the incomplete information case, where each server has information only about past usage frequency of local data, and suggests how it can estimate its utility from other data items (new or remote ones) in order to bid efficiently for them.

Reference-contexts: Agents in the contract net environment decompose their tasks to subtasks and subcontract them to other agents, using bidding. Extensions of the contract net for environments with self-motivated agents were proposed in [9]. Mullen and Wellman <ref> [6] </ref> proposed a market price model for decisions about establishing mirror sites in a network. They suggested competitive-market pricing of the transportation price (when no mirror site is established) and the price of establishing mirror sites.

Reference-contexts: A specific example of a distributed knowledge system is the Data and Information System component of the Earth Observing System (EOSDIS) of NASA <ref> [7] </ref>. This distributed system supports archiving and distribution of data at multiple and independent data centers (called DAACs). The current policy for data allocation in NASA is static: each DAAC specializes in specific topics.

Reference-contexts: However, the competitive approach is not useful in our environment since it is applicable only in environments in which it is possible to produce more than one item of each product type, and in our environment each data item is unique. A bidding mechanism is suggested by <ref> [8] </ref> for an automated negotiation environment, where phone companies compete to serve as carriers for long distance phone calls, with dynamic prices. In particular, they propose the use of Vick-rey's sealed bidding scheme [12].

Reference-contexts: In environments in which each server cares about the exact location of each dataset, even when such a location is remote, a bidding protocol is not beneficial, since the server's agent cannot influence the location of such a dataset. For such environments, we suggest elsewhere <ref> [10] </ref> using the strategic model of alternating offers as a solution method, enabling each agent to influence the decision of the exact location of each dataset, even without storing it locally. We showed, however, that bidding is better than strategic negotiations in the environments considered in this paper.

Reference-contexts: A bidding mechanism is suggested by [8] for an automated negotiation environment, where phone companies compete to serve as carriers for long distance phone calls, with dynamic prices. In particular, they propose the use of Vick-rey's sealed bidding scheme <ref> [12] </ref>. In this kind of auction, each bidder submits one bid, in ignorance of the other bids, and the highest bidder pays the amount of the second-highest bid and wins. In this paper, we have implemented a sealed bidding scheme for the data allocation problem in distributed knowledge environments. <p> That is, for each dataset, the best bidding strategy for each agent is to bid a price which is equal to its utility from storing this dataset, and this is independent of the other bids <ref> [12] </ref>. In the awarding step, each agent will broadcast an award message for all announcements it made in the first step. <p> Our protocol is different from the basic bidding protocol <ref> [12] </ref>, since we include the payments of the relocation costs in the protocol, and thus the desired properties of the bidding mechanism should be proved for this modified protocol. <p> I.e., price suggested (bidder; ds) = U bidder (ds; bidder) obtain cost (ds; bidder): Bidding the real utility is the dominant strategy, and the proof is similar to that of the Vickrey auction <ref> [12] </ref>. However, in our case, the winner incurs expenses related to obtaining the dataset, and the contractor incurs expenses related to moving the datasets to the winner (costs of resources needed for the move).
