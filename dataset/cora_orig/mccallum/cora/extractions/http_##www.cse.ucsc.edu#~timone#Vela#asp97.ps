Abstract: A new method of non-slicing floorplan-ning is proposed, which is based on the new representation for non-slicing floorplans proposed by [1], called bounded slicing grid(BSG) structure. We developed a new greedy algorithm based on the BSG structure, running in linear time, to select the alternative shape for each soft block so as to minimize the overall area for general floorplan, including non-slicing structures. We propose a new stochastic optimization method, named genetic simulated annealing (GSA) [3] for general floorplanning. Based on BSG structure, we extend SA-based local search and GA-based global crossover to L-shaped, T-shaped blocks and obtain high density packing of rectilinear blocks.
