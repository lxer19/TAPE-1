Reference-contexts: Group 4 consists of just one butterfly, which is clearly out on its own. The correct classification is known, and there are indeed four groups. In addition, the correct classification is exactly equal to the optimal classification found by our methods <ref> (Celeux and Robert, 1993) </ref>. 12 Data. 3.3 Example 3: Kinematic Stellar Data Until fairly recently, it was believed that the Galaxy consists of two stellar populations, the disk and the halo.

Reference-contexts: Our priors are chosen from among the conjugate priors of Section 2.1 so as to be fairly flat in the region where the likelihood is substantial and not much greater elsewhere. Thus they satisfy the "Principle of Stable Estimation" <ref> (Edwards, Lindman and Savage 1963) </ref>, and so it could be expected that the results would be relatively insensitive to reasonable changes in the prior; we also checked this empirically for each example.

Reference-contexts: The estimation results are quite insensitive. The testing results are somewhat more sensitive, which is to be expected <ref> (Kass and Raftery 1995) </ref>, but the overall conclusions remain the same over all combinations of prior parameters considered. Perhaps the greatest advantage of the present approach is that it fully assesses uncertainty about group membership, rather than merely giving a single "best" partition.

Reference-contexts: Convergence was almost immediate and successive draws were almost independent; similar results were obtained from other starting values. We used 1,500 iterations, estimated by the gibbsit program to be enough to estimate the cumulative distribution function at the .025 and .975 quantiles to within :01 for all the parameters <ref> (Raftery and Lewis 1993, 1995) </ref>; the first 10 iterations were discarded. The model comparison results are shown in Table 2. The correct model, [ k I], and the correct number of groups, 2, are strongly favored.

Reference-contexts: The balance of astronomical opinion has also tilted towards this conclusion, but based on much more information than just the velocities used here, including star positions and metallicities <ref> (Soubiran 1993) </ref>. It is impressive that such a strong conclusion can be reached with the present methods using only a relatively small part of the total available information.
