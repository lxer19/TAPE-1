Title: BigSur: A System For the Management of Earth Science Data  
Author: Paul Brown Michael Stonebraker 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: EECS Department University of California, Berkeley  EECS Department University of California,  
Abstract: In this paper we present a prototype system for the management of earth science data which is novel in that it takes a DBMS centric view of the the task. Our prototype -- called "BigSur" -- is shown in the context of its use by two geographically distributed scientific groups with demanding data storage and processing requirements. BigSur currently stores 1 Terabyte of data, about one thousandth of the volume EOSDIS must store. We claim that the design principles embodied in BigSur provide sufficient exibility to achieve the difficult scientific and technical objectives of Mission to Planet Earth.

Reference-contexts: The first is based on the US Federal Government Data Committee Content Standards for Digital Spatial Metadata (FGDC) <ref> [FGDC94] </ref>, and it stores the identification information and general audit information for each large object.

Reference-contexts: We use the Illustra Image and 2d Spatial type libraries to pose sophisticated GIS style queries over raster and spatial types <ref> [ILL95] </ref>. Much of BigSur's functionality is implemented as extensions to the SQL query language in Illustra. The Illustra ORDBMS allows schema designers to use many object oriented data modelling techniques like inheritance.

Reference-contexts: The design of the metadata super-class library introduced above was far from trivial. Much energy had been invested in designing standards for metadata schemas, and our prototype leveraged these efforts as much as possible, extending them only where they fell short of our requirements. <ref> [JTA94] </ref> This library of super-classes, what we refer to as the BigSur schema, is divided into three modules.

Reference-contexts: Then it was realised that the mid-Pacific oceanic current El Nino exerts tremendous inuence over US weather patterns, so many historically uninteresting models were reinvesti-gated. Within this array data, climate modelers look for atmospheric features like cyclones, or changes in ocean currents <ref> [MESR94] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, BigSur would use a fully distributed DBMS like Mariposa <ref> [STON94] </ref>, which handles location transparency as part of its core functionality. Unfortunately there is no commercial system of this type available so we have been obliged to implement a rudimentery subset of these features as extensions to Illustra SQL.

Conclusions We hav e introduced BigSur, an innovative prototype system for the management of earth science data. Specifically, it was designed to fulfill the requirements of two scientific communities, but its broader goal was to demonstrate how NASA's EOSDIS could be constructed.
