Abstract: The notion of commitment is central to understanding agents and multi-agent systems. A related notion arises in databases and distributed computing. We compare the two notions, and propose a synthesis, which combines the best properties of both. Our synthesis involves a generalization of spheres of control. We show how multiagent systems can function as generalized spheres of commitment, addressing the issue of structure, and providing context for commitments. This yields a generic approach to commitment that can handle discharge and cancelation naturally.

Reference-contexts: Modern applications of databases, which involve heterogeneous databases and programs, and human collaboration, do not fit the traditional mold. Some of these applications have been addressed using agent-based techniques, e.g., [ Wittig, 1992; Singh & Huhns, 1994 ] ; others with advanced database techniques, e.g., <ref> [ Bukhres & Elmagarmid, 1996 ] </ref> ; and still others by combining in organizational techniques, e.g., [ Papazoglou et al., 1992 ] . Such applications require greater organizational flexibility reflected in more flexible forms of commitment. Multiagent systems are finding increasing application in heterogeneous and open information environments. <p> This phenomenon is sometimes called cascading aborts and, while undesirable from a performance standpoint, it might be required for correctness. Conceptually, SoCs are related to a number of extended transaction models that have been proposed <ref> [ Elmagarmid, 1992; Bukhres & Elmagarmid, 1996 ] </ref> . SoCs are thus a useful idea, and significantly more powerful than traditional database transactions.

Reference-contexts: Notice that promises and assertives bring about the relevant commitments, even if the speaker is insincere! The speaker is subject to censure for having lied <ref> [ Castelfranchi, 1993 ] </ref> . More generally, interaction protocols, e.g., for various kinds of negotiation, may be defined so that the agents have the relevant commitments at appropriate times. * Ecological agency: The interactions may also arise because of infrastructural reasons. <p> We use the term commiter to refer to the agent that makes a commitment, and the term commitee (not "committee") to refer to the agent who receives the commitment. Castelfranchi proposes that commitments are established in the presence of a witness, who as it were officiates at the event <ref> [ Castelfranchi, 1993 ] </ref> . We generalize this idea to the context of a commitment. Intuitively, the context includes the norms or conventions that apply in the given society as well as the situation at the time the commitment is instantiated. <p> Gasser describes some of the sociological issues underlying multiagent systems [ Gasser, 1991 ] . His notion of the multiple simultaneous roles played by social agents inspired part of our discussion above. Castelfranchi studies concepts similar to those here <ref> [ Castelfranchi, 1993 ] </ref> . However, he distinguishes a notion of collective commitment, which is subsumed by our concept of commitment through the orthogonal representation of the structure of multiagent systems.

Reference-contexts: they would (by definition) be isolated, i.e., uncollaborative! For the above reasons, superior primitives are needed for modeling composite activities, and the commitments among their components. 2.2 Spheres of Control Spheres of control (SoC), which sought to characterize activities more generally than database transactions, were proposed about two decades ago <ref> [ Davies, 1978 ] </ref> . The database community is seeing a resurgence of interest in SoCs as the limitations of traditional transactions are obstructing their application in open environments [ Gray & Reuter, 1993, pages 174-180 ] .

Reference-contexts: For this reason and to better understand the intuitions developed in traditional distributed database settings, it is instructive to review commitment as it is implemented in those settings. 2.1 Traditional Database Transactions Traditional transactions are computations that satisfy a number of useful properties, in particular the so-called ACID properties <ref> [ Gray & Reuter, 1993 ] </ref> . * atomicity: all or none of a transaction happens * consistency: a transaction preserves the consistency of the database * isolation: intermediate results of a transaction are not visible externally * durability: when a transaction concludes successfully, its effects are permanent. <p> The database community is seeing a resurgence of interest in SoCs as the limitations of traditional transactions are obstructing their application in open environments <ref> [ Gray & Reuter, 1993, pages 174-180 ] </ref> . Intuitively, SoCs attempt to contain the effects of an action as long as there might be a necessity to undo them. A result can be released only when it is established that it is correct (and will remain correct). <p> SoCs are thus a useful idea, and significantly more powerful than traditional database transactions. However, they are not formalized to any significant extent, and have proved difficult to implement <ref> [ Gray & Reuter, 1993, page 180 ] </ref> |they presuppose elaborate mechanisms for undoing the effects of committed activities. We submit that SoCs can find a natural home in appropriately structured multiagent systems.

Reference-contexts: We are studying the database-specific ramifications of our approach. An interesting consequence of our approach is that it relies purely on social concepts to formalize commitments. Some previous approaches, e.g., <ref> [ Levesque et al., 1990; Grosz & Sidner, 1990 ] </ref> , postulate mutual beliefs among the committing agents. Mutual beliefs involve the agents to hold beliefs about each other to unbounded levels of nesting. The disadvantages of mutual beliefs are considered in [ Singh, 1996 ] .

While we share many of the intuitions and motivations of <ref> [ Jennings, 1993 ] </ref> (including applications involving heterogeneous information systems), we attain greater generality through the explicit use of the structure of multiagent systems. The agents always commit in the context of their multiagent system, and sometimes to that system.

However, traditional agent and multiagent approaches have not developed the level of robustness of the database approaches.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The notion of social commitment is central to DAI. This is the familiar notion where an agent makes a commitment to another agent (with certain nuances that we discuss below). This paper does not discuss psychological commitment <ref> [ Singh, 1996 ] </ref> , so "commitment" means "social commitment" throughout. Commitments have drawn much research attention because they are an important abstraction for characterizing, understanding, analyzing, and designing multiagent systems. Commitments help coordinate and structure multiagent systems to achieve coherence in their actions. Commitments also arise in distributed databases. <p> Some previous approaches, e.g., [ Levesque et al., 1990; Grosz & Sidner, 1990 ] , postulate mutual beliefs among the committing agents. Mutual beliefs involve the agents to hold beliefs about each other to unbounded levels of nesting. The disadvantages of mutual beliefs are considered in <ref> [ Singh, 1996 ] </ref> . Mutual beliefs cannot be implemented except through additional simplifying assumptions, which is why the direct approach of using social constructs is more appealing. We conjecture that named commitments, which are reminiscent of contract numbers in business dealings, provide the necessary connections among the agents.

Tuomela develops an interesting theory of joint action and intention that bears similarities to collective commitments <ref> [ Tuomela, 1991 ] </ref> . [ Sichman et al., 1994 ] develop a theory and interpreter for agents who can perform social reasoning.

Dependence leads to joint plans for achieving the intended goals. This theory does not talk about commitments per se, so it is complementary to our approach. We believe that the approach of <ref> [ Wittig, 1992 ] </ref> can be merged with our approach to yield more sophisticated reasoning involving context, especially organizational context, and more predictable behavior when commitments must be canceled. We also believe that we will be able to provide stronger database-specific underpinnings.
