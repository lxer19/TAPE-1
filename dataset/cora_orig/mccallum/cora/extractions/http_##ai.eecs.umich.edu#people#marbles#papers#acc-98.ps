Abstract: The University of Michigan has developed a fixed-wing model aircraft (Solus) with an embedded control system to develop and demonstrate UAV technology. The analytical objective of this project is the development of intelligent flight control and trajectory planning techniques, focusing on automated fault detection and recovery. Our experimental objective is to implement and evaluate these techniques on Solus for a variety of mission and fault scenarios.

Reference-contexts: All these instruments are mounted on a 5 inch cube in the plane's fuselage. This design was motivated by <ref> [1] </ref> as well as integration constraints. Calibration of the IMU cube was conducted as a stand alone unit using an Ideal Aerosmith rate table and Singer Scorsby table. The calibration was then verified using the combination of the rate and Scorsby tables. 2.2.

Reference-contexts: On Line System Identification and Reconfigurable Flight Control In recent years, off line identification techniques have been successful at building aircraft models from flight data. The identification is performed off line to obtain a dynamic model that is used to design a gain scheduled controller <ref> [2] </ref>. While this is a viable method of building flight control architectures, the UAV project aims to maintain system operation in the presence of unforeseen changes in aircraft dynamics.

Reference-contexts: In addition, this dynamic model will be used to forecast vehicle performance capabilities for use in online trajectory planning. Quite often measurement and process noise as well as inaccurate approximation of system order make identification difficult. For these reasons, the online identification will be performed using -Markov parameterized models <ref> [3] </ref>. -Markov parameterizations are non-minimal transfer functions that have sparse denominator polynomial structure and Markov parameters as coefficients of the numerator polynomial. These Markov parameters can then be used directly for controller design or indirectly by building state space models [4].

These Markov parameters can then be used directly for controller design or indirectly by building state space models [4]. When performing least squares identification using -Markov parameterizations [3], the estimate of the system's Markov parameters are consistent, or unbiased, in the presence of correlated measurement and process noise. Moreover, the estimates are unbiased even with inaccurate knowledge of system order.

Reference-contexts: A study by the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority indicated that all the manufacturers of aircraft, and a sizeable portion of commercial pilots interviewed for the study "regarded ice detectors as unreliable" <ref> [5] </ref>. This is an area that would benefit greatly from an effective online ice detection and identification algorithm. Presently ice detectors are mechanical devices that can only detect icing at specific points on the aircraft.

Reference-contexts: Current weather/wind conditions and air traffic restrictions are used to complete the flight plan with values such as fuel consumption and time en route. Our UAV research in flight planning begins with the incorporation of knowledge-based planning and real-time plan scheduling techniques such as those in <ref> [6] </ref> to build way-point trajectories that accomplish mission objectives (e.g., surveillance over a specified area for our UAV) given an initial dynamic model and wind estimates.

Reference-contexts: A major benefit of a knowledge-based planning system is flexibility, gained from a user-friendly world model and the ability to incorporate state feedback into planning, even if the current state was previously "unplanned-for" <ref> [7] </ref>. As discussed above, model ID research will focus on fault detection and isolation. By performing dynamic trajectory replanning when necessary, we will address the problem of fault recovery.
