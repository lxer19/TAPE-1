Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Workflow Management (WM) is an emerging area that involves cross-disciplinary fields as Database, Software Engineering, Business Management, Human Coordination, and so on. OBJECTFLOW is a project <ref> [1] </ref> comprised into the Pan European Project (PEP, a project from the company CCS), in which an integral business management system for medium or big corp orations is created. Its main objective is the development of a business information system int e-grated and automated by workflow tools. <p> Existing hardware and software support. A WMS is a computer system that coordinates the work among people, so it is indispensable that the organization have a network of computers to deploy such kind of system. The OBJECTFLOW WMS underlies on the Client Server Par a-digm <ref> [1] </ref>. Before starting the Template, the analyst must determine what kind of workflow application is the most suitable for the organization and specifically for the BP to be designed and enacted. In OBJECTFLOW we adopted the Workflow Application Classification Scheme (WACS) [15] to accomplish this task.

Reference-contexts: The naming decision for the project is CCS responsibility. 2 language. Also the business rules can be graphically expressed using appropriated graphical items and written with the User Procedure Language (UPL) <ref> [2] </ref>. This document is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a background of the Workflow Ma n-agement, Section 3 describes the method followed to model and depict any BP of a corporation using the Designer, e.g., a travel request process or a software development process. <p> Also, the O B-JECTFLOW WMS variables can be referenced in any line of code. Each graphical item and type of instances (from Templates, Cases, and Tasks) the engine ma n-age has programmable events <ref> [2] </ref>. The analyst can associate UPL code to each event executed by the engine when the event occurs. The analyst can compile a Template and generate the UPL code at any stage of the design. 8 5.2 Properties Editor This module allows to fill the properties of a graphical item.

Reference-contexts: Finally Section 7 presents the future work and conclusions. Appendix A contains the corresponding UPL code generated for the client credit request workflow presented in Section 6. 2 Workflow Management As defined by the Workflow Management Coalition <ref> [3] </ref>, a workflow is the automation of a BP, in whole or part, during which documents, information or tasks are passed from one participant to another for action, according to a set of procedural rules.

Reference-contexts: The need to improve the efficiency in the organization and the possibility to model organiz a-tions as process-centered, and automate these models, have promoted the development of WMSs. There are several successful applications reported in industry <ref> [4] </ref> and more than one hundred commercial products [5,6]. Also there are projects with both industry and research participation [7]. As a research area, there are four main fields: technology [8], conceptual modeling [9,10], organization [11] and methodology [12].

Based on the rules followed to assign the tasks to the workers, the kind of workflow can be ad hoc, business or production <ref> [16] </ref>. In the first one, there are no rules or they are informal, in the case of business workflow, there are policies to a s-sign tasks, but some users could choose freely (or almost) who shall do the work. In production workflows, the rules and the process are well defined.
