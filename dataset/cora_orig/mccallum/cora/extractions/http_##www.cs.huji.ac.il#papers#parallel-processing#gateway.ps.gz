Abstract: The Makbilan Gateway is an expansion module for Multibus II, which permits the Message Passing protocol of the Parallel System Bus to operate between devices on physically separate systems. Via the Gateway a bus agent may pass messages directly to agents on the same bus, or on another Multibus II system, in the same manner. By establishing a physical link between the two bus systems, the Gateway enables the boards to handshake transparently, in the usual way, with no additional I/O protocol or special addressing required. The Gateway was designed for the Makbilan Parallel Computer, in which parallel execution is carried out through the sharing of data and instructions among single board computers which share the Parallel System Bus. To expand the Makbilan beyond the 20 slot limit of Multibus II, it was decided to develop a bus-to-bus expansion module, to avoid sending high volume interprocessor traffic across Ethernet. Because the Gateway extends the message passing protocol, the throughput approaches the 40 MByte/sec. rate of Multibus II, which cannot be achieved in a LAN.
