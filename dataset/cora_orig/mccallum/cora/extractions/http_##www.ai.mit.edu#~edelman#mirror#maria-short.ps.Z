Abstract: We describe a computational model of face recognition, which generalizes from single views of faces, by taking advantage of prior experience with other faces, seen under a wider range of viewing conditions. The model represents face images by vectors of activities of graded overlapping receptive fields (RFs) [10]. It relies on high spatial frequency information to estimate the viewing conditions, which are then used to normalize (via a transformation specific for faces), and identify, the low spatial frequency representation of the input. The class-specific transformation approach allows the model to replicate a series of psychophysical findings on face recognition [7], and constitutes an advance over current face recognition methods, which are incapable of generalization from a single example.

Reference-contexts: The interpretation offered by our model for the results obtained with distinctive faces can be extended to account for the peculiarities of recognition of faces across race <ref> [1] </ref>. It is well known that people used to see predominantly Caucasian faces find it more difficult to distinguish among Oriental faces than people living in the Orient, and vice versa.

Reference-contexts: The central difference between upright and inverted faces, which presumably allows the former, but not the latter, to be recognized easily under a wide range of unfamiliar conditions, is the extensive experience of the human visual system with upright faces in everyday life <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It turns out, however, that one can effectively combine the viewpoint information carried by the high-frequency (16 cpd) RFs with the face identity information in the low-frequency (0.8 cpd) RFs, by training appropriately constructed function approximation modules (we used for this purpose radial basis function, or RBF, classifiers <ref> [8, 5] </ref>).

Adding an ensemble-based classifier improved the performance of that system by over 20%, and should have a similar effect on the performance of the present model. <p> From the practical standpoint, the model constitutes a significant advance over the approach of Edelman et al. <ref> [5] </ref>, which also used RBF classifiers to learn face recognition from examples, but was incapable of generalization from a single image of a face. From the standpoint of theoretical neurobiology, the model suggests a promising approach to the understanding of the computational basis of class-based generalization in human vision.

Reference-contexts: The i'th component of P (f 1 ) is then proportional to the change in the normal direction at the i'th RF, and can differ at most by ffi from person to person. As shown in <ref> [6] </ref>, for two persons f 1 and f 2 for whom the corresponding normals differ at most by ffi, the length of the difference vector kP (f 1 ) P (f 2 ) k is bounded from above by ffi. <p> As shown in <ref> [6] </ref>, this bound is equal to: p 1 (2ffi= min j (L N)j) . We have tested the validity of the above bounds on class-specific transformations in RF space empirically, using a 19-parameter model of face geometry, constructed with a 3D graphics toolkit (SGI Inventor). <p> (f i ) P (f j ) k and 6 (P (f i ) ; P (f j ) ) were nearly identical for the different face models (i.e., different choices of f 1 ; f 2 ), and in all cases lay well within the analytically de rived bounds <ref> [6] </ref>.

We next assessed the behavior of kP (f i ) P (f j ) k and 6 (P (f i ) ; P (f j ) ) on real face images, taken from the Weizmann FaceBase [7]. <p> Middle: experience= 18, upright. Right: experience= 18 with upright faces, testing with inverted faces (cf. [7]). The performance is similar to that of human subjects (Figure 7) in several respects (upright/inverted comparison; better generalization over illumination vs. viewpoint; see <ref> [6] </ref> for details). of each face, and had to recognize 15 other images of the same face, taken from very different (up to 68 o ) viewpoints, and under widely varying illuminations.

Reference-contexts: for face recognition, which are by and large incapable of generalization from a single view. 1.1 Psychophysical background A new insight into the computational basis of human generalization performance in face recognition has been achieved as a result of a recent study that compared generalization for upright and inverted faces <ref> [7] </ref>. Human subjects performing an upright face discrimination task were found to generalize nearly perfectly to face images obtained under novel illumination and viewpoint direction. In comparison, for inverted faces, the generalization to novel views was significantly worse. <p> Class-specific transformations for real faces. We next assessed the behavior of kP (f i ) P (f j ) k and 6 (P (f i ) ; P (f j ) ) on real face images, taken from the Weizmann FaceBase <ref> [7] </ref>. The results for the length and the angle differences appear, respectively, in Figures 3 and 4, which illustrate the correlated changes induced in the RF-space representations of different faces by changes in the viewing conditions. <p> In this manner, the model is capable of improving its performance with experience. 5 Comparing model and human performance We compared the performance of the model with that of human subjects, by replicating the upright/inverted face recognition experiments described in <ref> [7] </ref>. In the simulated experiment, the model was trained on a varying number of upright faces (each shown under a range of conditions, as described above). <p> The difficulty of this task is noteworthy: the system was provided with just one view upright faces. Middle: experience= 18, upright. Right: experience= 18 with upright faces, testing with inverted faces (cf. <ref> [7] </ref>). <p> the essentially perfect ( 97% correct) gener alization performance of human subjects for upright faces. levels of experience with upright faces - 1 and 18), alongside a plot of a system exposed to 18 upright faces and tested on the generalization over images of inverted faces (paralleling the experiments of <ref> [7] </ref>). A comparison of these plots with those of human subjects (Figure 7) shows that the contrast between generalization patterns for upright and inverted faces | the main point of the present experiment, as well as of the experiments described in [7] | is similar in the model and the human <p> over images of inverted faces (paralleling the experiments of <ref> [7] </ref>). A comparison of these plots with those of human subjects (Figure 7) shows that the contrast between generalization patterns for upright and inverted faces | the main point of the present experiment, as well as of the experiments described in [7] | is similar in the model and the human data. 6 Summary and discussion We have presented a model of the human ability to generalize face recognition from a single image.

Reference-contexts: This caused the model's mean generalization performance (correct recognition rate for novel views) to grow from 59% to 66% correct. When the knowledge of bilateral symmetry of faces was taken into account, as suggested (albeit in a different context) in <ref> [9] </ref>, an additional training view became effectively available to the system, boosting the generalization performance in the high experience case to 76%. Now, this figure is similar to the performance of the first stage of the system of [5] (which, however, was only capable of generalization from multiple examples).

Reference-contexts: This assumption relies on a recent computational investigation <ref> [10] </ref>, which showed that images of the same face form tighter clusters at the higher levels of an RF-based representation hierarchy resembling the one found in mammalian vision. <p> Images of each of the 50 face models were computed under five different viewing positions and three illumination directions, and were represented by activ ities of 500 RFs, as described in section 1 (see also <ref> [10] </ref>). <p> In both cases, the correlations apparent from Figures 3 and 4 would stem from the common displacement of all clusters following a certain transformation (either of view or of face identity). The spatial frequency analysis of face-difference images reported in <ref> [10] </ref> suggests that the nature of clustering of faces in RF-space should depend on the size of the RFs used in the representation. We tested this conjecture, by convolving face images with Difference of Gaussian RFs, corresponding in size to the different spatial frequency channels described in [11].

Reference-contexts: RF-based representation. A basis for the similarity of face images must be provided before one can discuss class-related issues. In biological visual systems, such a basis can be derived naturally from the concept of a unit with a localized receptive field (RF), known in psychophysics as spatial frequency channel <ref> [11] </ref>; activities of the RF units at the previous stages is the only input available to any processing stage in the visual pathway past the retina. Clustering by face identity. <p> We tested this conjecture, by convolving face images with Difference of Gaussian RFs, corresponding in size to the different spatial frequency channels described in <ref> [11] </ref>. Eight values of RF size, between 0:8 cycles per degree (cpd) and 16 cpd, were used with images of different faces, under different viewing conditions. For each RF size, we conducted 60 trials, with faces chosen randomly from the Weizmann database.
