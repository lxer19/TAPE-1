Abstract: 3 The Journal is an NLS subsystem with basic methods for handling full-text computerized items that parallel those of open-literature professional journals and asso ciated library servicesi.e. a permananent record of any published item, citation conventions by which later readers can retrieve and access references to other items, and catalogs and indices for retrieval aid. Each of these pro cesses is done much faster in our computer environment, and other computerized ser vices may be added. Altogether this pro vides a very powerful foundation for a new level of collaboration via recorded dialogue. 3b Our experience with these "teleconferenc ing" provisions brings out two important points: (1) computer-aided teleconferencing is much enhanced when integrated coher ently with effective computer aids for doing one's other knowledge-work operations, and (2) computer networks add critically important capabilities to this en - hanced form of telconferencing. 3d
