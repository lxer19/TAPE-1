Title: A Value-Driven System for Scheduling Information Gathering Tracking Number: A365 Content Areas: AI systems, real-time
Abstract: This paper presents a system for scheduling information gathering in an information rich domain under time and monetary resource restrictions. The system gathers information using an explicit representation of the users decision model and a database of information sources. Information gathering actions (queries) are scheduled myopically by selecting the query with the highest marginal value. This value is determined by the value of the information with respect to the decision being made, the responsiveness of the information source, and a time cost function specified by the user. We describe the benefits of the system and the lessons learned from its development.

These task structures represent possible search strategies to use for collecting information online to make a decision (e.g. Deciding which type of car is a better purchase).

It uses a simple natural language extraction engine to both identify the price and make sure that the product is the latest version and for the correct platform.

Their goal is to construct information carnivores that can use information generated by low-level agents as well as by directly accessing web pages in order to further process information before it is passed on to the user.

It can also be applied to signal processing (Klassner 1996), and numerous other domains. The VDIG system architecture integrates AI techniques from several different fields: decision-making under uncertainty, information extraction, and resource-bounded planning.

Reference-contexts: A decision model is available that allows the system to make decisions with incomplete information. The quality of the decision increases as more information becomes available. 2. The decision model can be used to determine the value of information <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref> for a set of information items used in the decision. 3. There are multiple information sources for each piece of information used in the decision. These sources have different monetary costs and response times. 4. <p> Internet Extraction Engine Utility penalty Cost Function Planner Information sources database ISD Querying engine Information Sources Database Read Valuedriven information gathering planner for our application is the ability to monotonically increase the quality of a decision as evidence becomes available and the ability to determining the value of missing information <ref> (Pearl 1988) </ref>. Figure 8 shows an example of an influence diagram used by the system. We use a commercial package called HUGIN in order to construct decision models, propagate evidence and evaluate alternative decisions.

Reference-contexts: Separating these two aspects of information gathering allows the system to add new information sources without altering the decision model. Information gathering has also been studied by the natural language processing community addressing mainly the problem of information extraction <ref> (Riloff 1994) </ref>. This technology allows systems to extract useful information from unrestricted text documents. By integrating this technology with the VDIG system we allow it to expand the range of information sources it can handle.
