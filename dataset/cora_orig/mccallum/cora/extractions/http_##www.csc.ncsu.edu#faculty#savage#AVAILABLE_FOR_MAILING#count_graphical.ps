Abstract: In this paper, we give a recurrence to enumerate the set G(n) of partitions of a positive even integer n which are the degree sequences of simple graphs. The recurrence gives rise to an algorithm to compute the number of elements of G(n) in time O(n 4 ) using space O(n 3 ). This appears to be the first method for computing jG(n)j in time bounded by a polynomial in n, and it has enabled us to tabulate jG(n)j for even n 220.

Reference-contexts: For those interested in the values jG (n)j, or in the ratio jG (n)j=jP (n)j from the open question of Section 1, we include Tables 1 and 2. To the best of our knowledge, the values had previously been computed only through n = 40, as noted in <ref> [ER] </ref> in an acknowledgement to Ron Read. &gt;From the data, it seems reasonable to make the conjecture that for even n 18, jG (n)j=jP (n)j is monotone decreasing, but we are not aware of any proof of this. <p> The best results known at this time are that lim n!1 n jG (n)j p (so the ratio cannot go to 0 faster than 1= p n <ref> [ER] </ref>) and that [RA1] lim n!1 jP (n)j Acknowledgements: Thanks to Steve Skiena for bringing this problem to our attention, to Frank Ruskey for pointing out references [SH] and [St], and to Bruce Richmond and Cecil Rousseau for sharing their work with us.

Reference-contexts: and sufficient condition below, attributed to Nash-Williams, is proved in [RA2] and [SH]. [Nash-Williams] A partition of an even integer is graphical if and only if for 1 j d (), i=1 (This condition is called the Hasselbarth Criterion by the authors of [SH] since they first saw it in <ref> [Has] </ref>, where it appeared without proof.) It can be shown that for 1 j d (), the j-th Nash-Williams condition is equivalent to the j-th Erdos-Gallai condition. Furthermore, if conditions 1; 2; : : :; d () of Erdos-Gallai are satisfied, then so are the remaining Erdos-Gallai conditions [RA2].
