Abstract: In this paper, we examine and characterize effects of communication interactions of parallel and sequential jobs on a nondedi-cated network of workstations. We quantitatively model the interaction process and measure communication delays of parallel jobs caused by the interaction. Measurement results on an ATM network of workstations support our analytical models.

Reference-contexts: We used two different NOW configurations: one was composed of 4 workstations (N 4) and the other of 8 workstations (N 8). We varied the workstation number in order to evaluate its effects on interaction. We selected four programs from the NAS parallel benchmarks <ref> [1] </ref>: MG, FT, EP, and IS. The programs were written in C and ran under PVM. They sent/received messages via TCP/IP. A point-to-point communication program called PP was written in C using TCP/IP. It sent fixed-size messages randomly, which satisfied the Possion process.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The wide availability of workstations and improving speed of networks have made networks of workstations (NOWs) become important platforms for parallel computation. To address the communication issue on NOWs, current research focuses on two main directions: to provide performance insights and to identify overhead sources of communications <ref> [2] </ref> [7] [8]; and to propose and implement models to reduce the communication overhead [4] [5] [9]. In addition to relatively low bandwidths of network communications, there is another issue that affects the performance: communication interactions. A NOW is usually not dedicated for parallel computation.

Reference-contexts: Examples of such communication patterns are neighbor communications and transpose communications <ref> [3] </ref>. Let A i j denote the jth (1 j m) workstation to which workstation i sends messages. The number of messages received by workstation A i j from all other workstations at one time is denoted as n i j .

Reference-contexts: We define the communication delay ratio (CDR) caused by the local user communications as: CDR = t It reflects the communication effect of local jobs on the performance of a parallel job. Assume that the local user traffic flow is a Poisson process <ref> [6] </ref>. Each workstation may have several local user traffic flows. Because the merging of several Poisson processes results in a new Poisson process, for the simplicity of discussions, we further assume that there is only one local user traffic flow in each workstation.

Reference-contexts: For a given mean of the interarrival time, t, the MTR of this flow is determined by M T R = 1 t . When several traffic flows merge, congestions may occur. Assuming we use the slow-start mechanism of TCP <ref> [10] </ref>, and the n message flows of the same type start simultaneously. We further assume that the protocol increases the window size of a flow by 1 unit after successfully transmitting a message for that flow. The increase does not stop until the congestion occurs.
