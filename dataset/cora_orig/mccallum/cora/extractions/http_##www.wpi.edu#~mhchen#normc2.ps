Abstract: Technical Report, Department of Mathematical Sciences Worcester Polytechnic Institute; Research Report No. 666, Department of Mathematics National University of Singapore February 22, 1996 Abstract Constraints on the parameters in a Bayesian hierarchical model typically make Bayesian computation and analysis complicated. As Gelfand, Smith and Lee (1992) remarked, it is almost impossible to sample from a posterior distribution when its density contains analytically intractable integrals (normalizing constants) that depend on the (hyper) parameters. Therefore, the Gibbs sampler or the Metropolis algorithm can not be directly applied to such problems. In this paper, using the idea of "reweighting mixtures" of Geyer (1994), we develop alternative Monte Carlo based methods to determine properties of the desired Bayesian posterior distribution. Necessary theory and two illustrative examples are provided.

Reference-contexts: With an obvious adjustment, the results presented in this section can be directly applied to marginal posterior density estimation. Recently, Monte Carlo based methods have been developed for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Such methods include bridge sampling (Meng and Wong 1993), path sampling <ref> (Gelman and Meng 1994) </ref>, a data-augmentation-based method to estimate the marginal density 7 (marginal likelihood) (Chib 1996), reverse logistic regression (Geyer 1994), and ratio importance sampling (Chen and Shao 1994 and 1995).

Reference-contexts: This makes Bayesian analysis very difficult. As Gelfand, Smith and Lee (1992) noticed, directly sampling from (; jdata) is nearly impossible. Therefore, the Gibbs sampler <ref> (Geman and Geman 1984 and Gelfand and Smith 1990) </ref> and the Metropolis algorithm (Metropolis et al. 1953 and Hastings 1970) either cannot be directly applied or are too expensive to be applied to such problems. 2 Bayesian constrained parameter problems with normalizing constants naturally arise in ordered and data constrained parameters
