Abstract: The year 1995 heralded the sequencing of the first whole microbial genomes (Refs 1, 2). The end of 1996 will see at least four more full microbial genomes sequenced. The entire yeast genome will also be submitted to the public databases. At this rate, we can expect to have access to the complete genomes of at least 25-30 organisms within five years. While most problems of automated sequence generation and sequence assembly (Ref. 3) have been solved, the automated analysis of genomic sequences has scarcely been addressed. Consequently, given the sheer amount of data generated, most genome sequences submitted to the publicly accessible databases are either poorly or not at all annotated. Yet, the success and utility of genomic sequencing depends crucially on the the analysis strategies, the quality of the software algorithms and the tools that are used to manage and interpret the sequence data. Sequence interpretation "by hand", as it is usually performed today, presents an overwhelming challenge to genome researchers. For each megabase of sequence (the equivalent of 1000 open reading frames in prokaryotes or yeast), one person has to devote an entire year of research to the inital sequence interpretation. Scanning the databases also has to be repeated frequently as new entries are added to the public databases daily. Most genome projects therefore do not have the capacities to analyze the sequence that they generate completely.
