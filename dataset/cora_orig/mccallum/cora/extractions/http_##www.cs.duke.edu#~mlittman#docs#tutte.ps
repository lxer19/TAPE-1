Reference-contexts: In this paper any such embedding of a graph in a higher dimensional space is called a Tutte embedding or barycentric mapping. In the next section we show embeddings of several graphs. We used the software tools NETPAD [2] and XGobi <ref> [1] </ref> to construct and view the embeddings in 3-space. 3 Examples Much is known about drawing planar graphs, and so we feel it is important to focus on drawing nonplanar graphs.

Reference-contexts: A graph G is d-polytopal if there is a d-polytope P such that G is isomorphic to G (P ). The following theorems of Steinitz and Tutte are of interest for 2 this paper. Theorem A (Steinitz, see Grunbaum <ref> [3] </ref>) A graph G is 3-polytopal if and only if G is planar and 3-connected. Theorem B (Tutte [7]) If G is 3-connected planar graph, then the facial cycles in any plane embedding of G are those cycles which are chordless and nonseparating.

Reference-contexts: For the proof we need a theorem of Levy-Desplanques <ref> [4] </ref> (page 146) and its variation, both of which are stated below. Theorem D Let A = (a ij ) be a complex n fi n matrix and ja ii j &gt; P n for i = 1; 2; : : : ; n. Then A is nonsingular. <p> Then A is nonsingular. The Levy-Desplanques theorem is usually referred to as the "Hadamard Theorem" and in a different form as "Minkowski Theorem" and may also be known by many other names, see <ref> [4] </ref> for more information. Proof of Theorem 1. We will use notation d i for d (v i ). Let z 1 = z 2 = : : : = z k = z. Then z 0 1 = z 0 k = z.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5, we give a negative answer to a question posed by Tutte [7]. The reader is referred to any standard text book on Graph Theory for the undefined terms. Several of the terms may also be found in Thomassen's article <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 The Tutte Embedding The graph G (P ) of a d-polytope P (i.e., P is the convex hull of a finite set of points in &lt; d ) is the graph consisting of the vertices and the edges of P .

Reference-contexts: Theorem B (Tutte [7]) If G is 3-connected planar graph, then the facial cycles in any plane embedding of G are those cycles which are chordless and nonseparating. Theorem C (Tutte <ref> [6] </ref>) Every 3-connected planar graph has a convex representation and any properly chosen convex polygon can play the role of outer cycle. The Tutte embedding or barycentric mapping is defined as follows.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Tutte <ref> [7] </ref> proved that a 3-connected planar graph has a nice embedding in the plane in the sense that it can be drawn so that the boundary of every face is a convex polygon and every edge is a straight line segment. This is called a convex embedding or convex representation. <p> In Section 4 we consider two different barycentric embeddings of G fi K 2 where G is 3-connected and prove that these embeddings are nice in a certain well-defined sense. In Section 5, we give a negative answer to a question posed by Tutte <ref> [7] </ref>. The reader is referred to any standard text book on Graph Theory for the undefined terms. <p> The following theorems of Steinitz and Tutte are of interest for 2 this paper. Theorem A (Steinitz, see Grunbaum [3]) A graph G is 3-polytopal if and only if G is planar and 3-connected. Theorem B (Tutte <ref> [7] </ref>) If G is 3-connected planar graph, then the facial cycles in any plane embedding of G are those cycles which are chordless and nonseparating. Theorem C (Tutte [6]) Every 3-connected planar graph has a convex representation and any properly chosen convex polygon can play the role of outer cycle. <p> We can extend the map f to all of V (G) as follows: f (v) = d (v) uv2E Tutte <ref> [7] </ref> shows that this extension is feasible and unique, and it results in an embedding of G in the plane with the property that C is the outer facial cycle, every face in the embedding is convex, and no two edges cross. <p> j ) + z (v i ) (5) Letting z (v i ) = x (v i ) where = 1=(d + 1 s) it is easy to see that the Equation 5 holds for each i = 1; 2; : : : ; n. 5 Tutte's Sphere Question Tutte <ref> [7] </ref> at the end his paper raised several questions including the following: Does every 3-connected planar graph have a representation on a sphere such that the vector drawn from the center to any vertex is in the direction of the resultant of the vectors drawn to its neighboring vertices?
