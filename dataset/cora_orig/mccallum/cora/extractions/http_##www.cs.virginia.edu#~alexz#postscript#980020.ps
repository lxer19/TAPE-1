Title: On Approximation of the Power-p and Bottleneck Steiner Trees  
Author: Piotr Berman Alexander Zelikovsky 
Abstract: Many VLSI routing applications, as well as the facility location problem involve computation of Steiner trees with non-linear cost measures. We consider two most frequent versions of this problem. In the power-p Steiner problem the the cost is defined as the sum of the edge length raised to power p, while in the bottleneck Steiner problem the cost is the maximum of the edge lengths. In contrast to the classical Steiner problem, the objective of the power-p and bottleneck Steiner tree problems is to minimize the sum of the edge lengths raised to the p power or the maximum edge length, respectively. We show that the both problems are NP-hard and, moreover, the bottleneck Steiner trees cannot be approximated with the factor less than 2, unless P = NP. We prove that the minimum spanning tree only constant times worse than the power-p Steiner tree in any metric space. In particular, for p = 2, we show that the minimum spanning tree is at most 23.3 times worse than the optimum and construct an instance when it is 17.2 times worse. We also present a better approximation algorithm for the bottleneck Steiner problem with performance guarantee log 2 n, where n is the number of terminals (the minimum spanning tree can be 2 log 2 n times worse than the optimum).

Reference-contexts: Indeed, if there is an edge of length less than the maximum length, then we may increase its length up to the maximum without increasing the bottleneck cost. We will use the following two lemmas which are well-known graph-theoretical facts (e.g. Lemma 5 can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>). Lemma 4 Given a tree with n leaves and all internal nodes of degree 3, except the root r that may have degree 2 or 3. There exists a leaf at most log 2 n edges away from r.

Reference-contexts: Research partially supported by Volkswagen Stiftung and Packard Foundation. 1 It is not difficult to see that, similarly to the classical Steiner tree problem, if Steiner points are not allowed, then the minimum spanning tree is the best Steiner tree for the both power-p and bottleneck Steiner problems (see <ref> [5] </ref>). It is well known that the minimum spanning tree cannot be longer than twice the length of the shortest Steiner tree ([15]), in other words, the Steiner ratio (the supremum of the minimum spanning tree cost over optimal cost) is at most 2. In [5], it was conjectured that the <p> and bottleneck Steiner problems (see <ref> [5] </ref>). It is well known that the minimum spanning tree cannot be longer than twice the length of the shortest Steiner tree ([15]), in other words, the Steiner ratio (the supremum of the minimum spanning tree cost over optimal cost) is at most 2. In [5], it was conjectured that the power-p Steiner ratio (i.e. the Steiner ratio for the p-STP) is finite. In Section 3 we prove that this conjecture is true, i.e. that the power-p Steiner ratio p is constant-bounded for any p.

Reference-contexts: In particular, for p = 2, we show that the minimum spanning tree is at most 23.3 times worse than the optimum. But we do not think that this bound is tight, since the worst instance of 2-STP that we construct has the Steiner ratio 17.2. In <ref> [6] </ref>, it was proved that the minimum spanning tree heuristic for the bottleneck Steiner tree problem is 2 log 2 jSj. <p> In the worst case that we have found the edge length x i form an arithmetical progression with the remainder 1 and the power-2 Steiner ratio is 17:2. 4 A Better Heuristic for the Bottleneck Steiner Problem It was proved in <ref> [6] </ref> that the Bottleneck Steiner ratio is at most 2 log 2 n, where n = jSj is the number of terminals.

Reference-contexts: Proof. It suffices to translate X3C (exact cover by 3-sets, see <ref> [10] </ref>). An instance to this problem is a set with some 3m elements, and a collection of 3-element subsets. The task is to find a collection of m disjoint subsets, i.e. to cover all the elements with a disjoint collection of subsets.
