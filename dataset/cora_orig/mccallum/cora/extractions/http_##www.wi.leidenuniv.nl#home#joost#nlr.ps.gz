Abstract: Air Traffic Control is involved in the real-time planning of aircraft trajectories. This is a heavily constrained optimization problem. We concentrate on free-route planning, in which aircraft are not required to fly over way points. The choice of a proper representation for this real-world problem is non-trivial. We propose a two level representation: one level on which the evolutionary operators work, and a derived level on which we do calculations. Furthermore we show that a specific choice of the fitness function is important for finding good solutions to large problem instances. We use a hybrid approach in the sense that we use knowledge about air traffic control by using a number of heuristics. We have built a prototype of a planning tool, and this resulted in a flexible tool for generating a free-route planning of low cost, for a number of aircraft.

Reference-contexts: When applying a fitness proportional selection scheme this will result in less selective pressure when the first conflict moves ahead in time and the fitness increases. In order to avoid this kind of scaling problem a ranking scheme is used <ref> [Bak85, GD91] </ref>. In a ranking scheme the individuals are sorted and ranked on fitness. The probability of being selected for reproduction is coupled to the rank. By adjusting the probability of survival the selective pressure can be set. Ranking is often combined with a steady-state algorithm [Sys91, Whi89].

By adjusting the probability of survival the selective pressure can be set. Ranking is often combined with a steady-state algorithm <ref> [Sys91, Whi89] </ref>. Such a steady-state algorithm replaces just a small part of the population during each iteration. Hence the rank will be recalculated often and a more aggressive search is obtained.
