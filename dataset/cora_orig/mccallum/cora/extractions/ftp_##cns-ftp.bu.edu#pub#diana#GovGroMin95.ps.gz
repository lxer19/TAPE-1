Reference-contexts: Filter values are further modulated by the slope of their tangent (small slopes are preferred to large slopes) and by their distance from the origin. A similar bipole filter with optimal orientations determined by parabolic equations was used to carry out BCS boundary segmentations of synthetic aperture radar images <ref> (Cruthirds et al., 1992) </ref>. The overall shape of both filters is similar to the original bipole cell of Grossberg & Mingolla (1985b) and to the "association field" of Field et al. (1993). March 14, 1995 34 A B (1985b).

Reference-contexts: This increase in activity of ON and OFF relay cells is effectively an increase in ON-OFF contrast, which is manifested after filling-in within the FCS as an increase in brightness contrast. This is the model analog of "brightness buttons" (Kennedy, 1979) and of "line end contrast" <ref> (Day & Jory, 1978) </ref>. The increased LGN activity at the line end can also better activate cortical simple cells located at the line end, resulting in stronger boundary formation perpendicular to the line end, as in the circular illusory contour of Figure 1A, than would otherwise be the case.

Reference-contexts: More generally, neither on-center off-surround cells (called ON cells below) nor off-center on-surround cells (called OFF cells below) can explain this phenomenon. We interpret this to mean that the ON and OFF cells that occur in the LGN (Schiller, 1992), and that are the source of cortical brightness percepts <ref> (De Yoe & van Essen, 1988) </ref> cannot, without further processing, explain brightness buttons. thin lines by ON or OFF cells must be less in magnitude than that generated along their sides. As explained below, this should make the Ehrenstein disk appear darker, rather than brighter, than its surround.

Reference-contexts: There are two basic cell types in the LGN: relay cells and interneurons. For present purposes extrinsic interneurons located in the perigeniculate nucleus can also be considered LGN interneurons. Retinal ganglion cells project directly to both types of cells <ref> (Dubin & Cleland, 1977) </ref>. While relay cells in turn project to visual cortex, the axons of interneurons remain in the LGN. <p> If the LGN were just a relay station, there would be no need for the precision or amount of feedback that is seen. &gt;From neurochemical evidence the feedback is believed to be excitatory (Montero, 1990), but since it directly activates both relay cells <ref> (Dubin & Cleland, 1977) </ref> and in-terneurons (Weber it et al., 1989), the overall effect of feedback on the LGN is hard to predict from the known anatomy (see Figure 6). Neurophysiologists have also had difficulty in assessing the function of the corticogeniculate feedback.

Reference-contexts: These boundaries are used to contain the filling-in of FCS signals. March 14, 1995 27 more closely resembles the visual percept when presented as a gray-scale image (below). Zero-valued nodes correspond to medium gray pixels in this image. arranged around a circle in a radial configuration <ref> (Ehrenstein, 1941) </ref>. The input image is shown in Figure 9A. Figure 9B shows brightness buttons in the model LGN cell activations. The complex cell responses (see Figure 8) are strongest at the ends of the line segments, reflecting the effects of the LGN stage.

Reference-contexts: Because model simple cells are sensitive to a definite direction-of-contrast, they are not optimally activated in a direction parallel to the dot-pair orientations of Figure 14A. The bipole groupings are thus also different. This basic property of the model has been misunderstood by some investigators <ref> (e.g., Elder & Zucker, 1993) </ref>, who have mistakenly inferred, because output cells of the BCS pool both directions-of-contrast, that BCS boundary segmentations are insensitive to image direction-of-contrast. Comparison of Figures 13C and 14C shows that this is not correct.

March 14, 1995 35 After the bipole cells compute how much evidence for a boundary exists in each orientation, cells compete across orientation with other cells at the same position (see Figure 8).

Reference-contexts: Some studies have found excitatory effects (eg., Kalil & Chase, 1970), while others have found inhibitory effects (eg., Hull, 1968), and still others found mixed excitatory and inhibitory effects (Marrocco & McClurkin, 1985). The modulation of cat LGN by cortical feedback changes with arousal level and brain-stem activity <ref> (Funke & Eysel, 1992) </ref>. The feedback can serve as a gain control mechanism for the entire thalamus, boosting the gain of signals from one modality while suppressing signals from other modalities.

Reference-contexts: Of all the synapses in the LGN, about 50% originate in cortex, compared to only 20% that originate in the retina (Robson, 1983). The feedback, which comes from cells that are binocular and orientation selective <ref> (Gilbert & Kelly, 1975) </ref>, is also topographic, with a strict correspondence between the locations of the visual fields of the bottom-up and top-down signals converging on a LGN cell (Updyke, 1975).

Reference-contexts: A Glass pattern may be constructed by superimposing a slightly rotated copy of a random field of dots onto the original. For a large range of viewing distances, this gives the impression of a circular structure <ref> (Glass, 1969) </ref>. The impression can be strengthened by placing the original dots on a randomly perturbed grid and setting a constant rotation distance, so that for every pair of corresponding dots, the distance between them is fixed (Stevens, 1978).

Reference-contexts: Because these ON and OFF cells have antagonistic surrounds and obey shunting, or membrane, equations (see the Appendix), they help to discount the illuminant, normalize image activities, and extract ratio contrasts from an image <ref> (Grossberg, 1983) </ref>. These image preprocessing properties are needed to simulate even the most basic brightness percepts (Grossberg & Todorovic, 1988). <p> In the ON channel, the center is excitatory while the surround is inhibitory (Figure 24A), whereas in the OFF channel, the center is inhibitory and the surround is excitatory (Figure 24B). The cells in each each channel obey membrane, or shunting, equations coupled by distance-dependent interactions <ref> (Grossberg, 1983) </ref>, whereby inputs I pq at position (p, q) are filtered by convolution filters that are defined by isotropic two-dimensional Gaussians.

Reference-contexts: Output signals from the BCS form compartments within the FCS, within which LGN inputs to the FCS initiate a diffusive filling-in process that generates a surface representation, including a percept of brightness. In the complete March 14, 1995 7 binocular BCS/FCS model <ref> (Grossberg, 1994) </ref>, this surface representation emerges only after several stages of BCS and FCS interaction occur. The model simulated herein has been simplified to focus upon the targeted data base. <p> The model simulated herein has been simplified to focus upon the targeted data base. The full BCS models aspects of the interblob cortical processing stream from area V1 to V4, and the FCS models the blob processing stream <ref> (see Grossberg, 1994, for a review) </ref>. Many brightness data have been simulated within this modeling framework (Andreou & Boahen, 1991; Arrington, 1994; Cohen & Grossberg, 1984; Grossberg & Todorovic, 1988; Pessoa et al., 1994). <p> The BCS models interactions between simple, complex, hypercomplex, higher-order hypercom-plex, and bipole cells that communicate with each other via feedforward and feedback pathways.

Reference-contexts: The bottom of Figure 22 also shows a case in which the segments are not parallel. These segments are relatable because their extensions do intersect and form an obtuse angle. Here the completion has no inflection point. Unlike the original bipole cell <ref> (e.g., of Grossberg & Mingolla, 1985b) </ref> in which the optimal orientation for any filter location was radial (i.e., pointing toward the cell's origin), the optimal orientation for a point (p, q) in the new bipole filter is tangent to the circle C centered on the y-axis that passes through (p, q) <p> For each of the K discrete orientations used in the model, there are two simple cells of opposite polarity. Thus there are 2K simple cells, whose activities are half-wave rectified and combined pairwise to activate K complex cells <ref> (Grossberg & Mingolla, 1985b) </ref>. <p> This can cause new signals to appear that flank and are perpendicular to existing boundaries. These new endcut signals help to generate boundaries, such as the Ehrenstein circle of Figures 1A and 9, that are perpendicular or obliquely oriented with respect to line ends <ref> (Grossberg & Mingolla, 1985b, 1987) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Where should the results of this endstopped processing have their effect on inputs to the FCS? Having come this far, it is plausible to propose that the cortex influences LGN cells via top-down feedback, which it is well known to do <ref> (Guillery, 1967) </ref>. It is not plausible, however, that this massive feedback pathway exists just to make Ehrenstein disks appear bright. <p> Versions I and II are functionally equivalent. Version II was used for simulations. March 14, 1995 11 Kemp, 1983). Both LGN cell types receive feedback from Layer 6 pyramidal cells in striate cortex <ref> (Guillery, 1967) </ref>. This corticogeniculate feedback is massive, with more fibers going from cortex to LGN than vice versa. Of all the synapses in the LGN, about 50% originate in cortex, compared to only 20% that originate in the retina (Robson, 1983).

Reference-contexts: Interactions must exist among the oriented filters to determine the location of the ends of the lines, at which the brightness buttons occur. A natural candidate for the latter interactions is the endstopping process that converts cortical complex cells into endstopped complex, or hypercomplex, cells <ref> (Hubel & Wiesel, 1977) </ref>. Where should the results of this endstopped processing have their effect on inputs to the FCS? Having come this far, it is plausible to propose that the cortex influences LGN cells via top-down feedback, which it is well known to do (Guillery, 1967).

Reference-contexts: Neurophysiologists have also had difficulty in assessing the function of the corticogeniculate feedback. Researchers trying to measure the effect of feedback on LGN transmission of retinal signals have met with inconsistent results. Some studies have found excitatory effects (eg., Kalil & Chase, 1970), while others have found inhibitory effects <ref> (eg., Hull, 1968) </ref>, and still others found mixed excitatory and inhibitory effects (Marrocco & McClurkin, 1985). The modulation of cat LGN by cortical feedback changes with arousal level and brain-stem activity (Funke & Eysel, 1992).

Reference-contexts: This increase in activity of ON and OFF relay cells is effectively an increase in ON-OFF contrast, which is manifested after filling-in within the FCS as an increase in brightness contrast.

Reference-contexts: This more general role for top-down processing is consistent with the fact that cortico-geniculate feedback is present in all parts of the visual field, not just the portion with binocular overlap, and the feedback is also present in species with little or no binocular overlap <ref> (Koch, 1987) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: More generally, neither on-center off-surround cells (called ON cells below) nor off-center on-surround cells (called OFF cells below) can explain this phenomenon. We interpret this to mean that the ON and OFF cells that occur in the LGN <ref> (Schiller, 1992) </ref>, and that are the source of cortical brightness percepts (De Yoe & van Essen, 1988) cannot, without further processing, explain brightness buttons. thin lines by ON or OFF cells must be less in magnitude than that generated along their sides. <p> A combination of the two mechanisms would have the same properties. Data available at present favor the first hypothesis, and that is the one investigated in the present work. 3. Model LGN Circuit The model LGN ON and OFF cells receive input from retinal ON and OFF cells. <ref> (See Schiller, 1992 for a review) </ref>. Because these ON and OFF cells have antagonistic surrounds and obey shunting, or membrane, equations (see the Appendix), they help to discount the illuminant, normalize image activities, and extract ratio contrasts from an image (Grossberg, 1983). <p> In all, the feedback instantiates a center-surround competition. The inhibitory surround can depress LGN signals in areas away from the line ends, such as along the line sides (Figure 4B). Since ON and OFF channels are segregated in the LGN <ref> (Schiller, 1992) </ref>, the feedback is applied to the ON and OFF layers separately. 4. Neurophysiological LGN Data The LGN model is supported by a variety of anatomical and physiological data from studies of the cat and monkey.

Reference-contexts: The impression can be strengthened by placing the original dots on a randomly perturbed grid and setting a constant rotation distance, so that for every pair of corresponding dots, the distance between them is fixed <ref> (Stevens, 1978) </ref>. This construction method was used to generate the Glass pattern input figure shown in Figure 13A. The model suggests that this percept is due to the combination of short-range correlations detected by the simple cells and long-range correlations detected by the bipole cells.

Reference-contexts: If the LGN were just a relay station, there would be no need for the precision or amount of feedback that is seen. &gt;From neurochemical evidence the feedback is believed to be excitatory (Montero, 1990), but since it directly activates both relay cells (Dubin & Cleland, 1977) and in-terneurons <ref> (Weber it et al., 1989) </ref>, the overall effect of feedback on the LGN is hard to predict from the known anatomy (see Figure 6). Neurophysiologists have also had difficulty in assessing the function of the corticogeniculate feedback.
