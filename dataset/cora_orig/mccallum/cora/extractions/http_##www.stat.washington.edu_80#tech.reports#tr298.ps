Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION With the world's population now greater than 5:5 billion, the need for reducing human fertility is as great as ever. While fertility rates in most developed countries have dropped dramatically during the last century <ref> (for example, see Coale and Watkins 1986) </ref>, high fertility rates are still common in many developing countries. The demographic question of what triggers and drives a fertility decline remains an open one. <p> In the context of any of these three theoretical frameworks, economic modernization remained central to reducing the growth rate of the human population. Based on the findings of the European Fertility Project <ref> (Coale and Watkins 1986) </ref>, alternative ideational explanations for reduced fertility rates received attention in the demographic literature (for example, Cleland and Wilson 1987). Instead of emphasizing economic modernization, ideation theory focused more on the diffusion of ideas as an explanation for fertility decline.

It has been argued by Heckman and Singer and other researchers that it is safer to assume the presence of unobserved heterogeneity unless it is shown that there is none.

Reference-contexts: In Table 4 we show Compound Laplace-Metropolis estimates of integrated likelihoods under Models 0 and 4 from Table 2 and for a model with FPP added to Model 4. The standard errors of the Compound Laplace-Metropolis estimates shown in Table 4 were found using the method of batch means <ref> (Lewis and Raftery 1994) </ref>. By taking differences between Compound Laplace-Metropolis estimates we computed log Bayes factors for comparing the models in Table 4. The choice of which model to use as the baseline is arbitrary. In Table 4, Model 0 was used as the baseline.
