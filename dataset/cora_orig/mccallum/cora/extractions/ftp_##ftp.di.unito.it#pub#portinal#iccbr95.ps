Title: ADAPtER: an Integrated Diagnostic System Combining Case-Based and Abductive Reasoning  
Author: Luigi Portinale, Pietro Torasso 
Address: Torino (Italy)  
Affiliation: Dipartimento di Informatica Universita' di  
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to describe the ADAPtER system, a diagnostic architecture combining case-based reasoning with abductive reasoning and exploiting the adaptation of the solution of old episodes, in order to focus the reasoning process. Domain knowledge is represented via a logical model and basic mechanisms, based on abductive reasoning with consistency constraints, have been defined for solving complex diagnostic problems involving multiple faults. The model-based component has been supplemented with a case memory and adaptation mechanisms have been developed, in order to make the diagnostic system able to exploit past experience in solving new cases. A heuristic function is proposed, able to rank the solutions associated to retrieved cases with respect to the adaptation effort needed to transform such solutions into possible solutions for the current case. We will discuss some preliminary experiments showing the validity of the above heuristic and the convenience of solving a new case by adapting a retrieved solution rather than solving the new problem from scratch.

Reference-contexts: Our proposal takes its place into the first category by means of the development of ADAPtER (Abductive Diagnosis through Adaptation of Past Episodes for Re-use), a diagnostic system integrating the model-based inference engine of Aid (Abductive and Iterative Diagnosis <ref> [1] </ref> a pure model-based diagnostic system we have developed which solves diagnostic problems "from scratch"), with a case-based component intended to provide a guide to the abductive reasoning performed by Aid.

Reference-contexts: A general theory of model-based diagnosis has been proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>. Here, we essentially adopt the same framework, where the model of the system to be diagnosed is represented by means of a logical theory T . <p> This means that a conjunction of atoms representing different instances of the same entity yields an inconsistency. The choice of + is critical and cannot be done without taking into account the kind and the amount of knowledge captured in the logical theory T (see <ref> [2] </ref>). Definition 1. <p> Moreover, in order to model incompleteness in the specification of causal relations, new entities represented by Assumption 1 Most of the work presented here can be adapted without much effort to the case where the domain knowledge is represented by a "structure and behavior" model <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The idea of using different representations for diagnostic problem solving has attracted a significant amount of attention and a number of systems, exploiting some form of integration among different representations, have been developed (see <ref> [3] </ref>). These experiences pointed out two main problems: 1) how to guarantee consistency between different knowledge representations; 2) how to combine and integrate different reasoning mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: In the last years, the paradigm of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) has shown to play a significant role in explanatory or abductive reasoning tasks like diagnosis, both as a "stand alone" mechanism [5, 8] and as integrated with Model-Based Reasoning (MBR) <ref> [7, 9, 4] </ref>. The use of cases seems to be very promising for addressing the two problems introduced above and for providing a model-based reasoner with some capability of learning by experience. <p> Approaches combining MBR with CBR can be roughly classified into two categories: approaches considering CBR as a speed-up and/or heuristic component for MBR [7, 9] and approaches viewing CBR as a way to recall past experience in order to account for potential errors in the device model <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A Retrieved Case on the notion of E-mop <ref> [6] </ref>. An E-mop is a generalization of a set of cases whose common characteristics are summarized into the E-mop itself and are called norms, while discriminatory features are used as indices to retrieve the cases. <p> During retrieval the system can ask for additional data to the user; in particular, when there is no possibility of retrieving cases from a given E-mop, the user is asked to provide values for some of the indices to be followed from the E-mop (using a term borrowed from <ref> [6] </ref>, this represents a kind of "discrimination strategy").

Differently from similar integrated diagnostic systems like Casey <ref> [7] </ref>, a basic feature of ADAPtER concerns the fact that model-based diagnostic problem solving relies on a formal logical theory of diagnosis and that the case-based component relies on such a characterization.

Reference-contexts: The selected solutions are then considered for adaptation 4 . 4.2 Adaptation Mechanisms The Adaptation Module can be considered as a "focusing" module for the model-based reasoner, guiding the latter, by means of its adaptation strategies, in choosing the suitable inference control strategy (see also <ref> [11] </ref>). Rather that using such inference strategies in an uncontrolled way, the model-based reasoner is focused to work on the selected retrieved solutions. More precisely, the adaptation strategy is based on the activation in sequence of the following mechanisms: consistency checking, inconsistency removal and explanation construction (or covering).
