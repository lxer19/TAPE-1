Abstract: In this paper we consider the notion of ought-to-do obligation in the context of several concepts of time. Starting from the relatively easy case of discrete time and a lockstep interpretation of actions, we experiment with several plausible definitions and propose a generalised notion of obligation for dense time. A crucial ingredient of the definition proposed is to consider a branching-time temporal operator in order to capture the obligation to a choice of actions adequately.

Reference-contexts: It appears that this type of action description is not suitable when we want to express obligation on actions as well. An alternative approach to describe actions in a temporal framework is given by Allen <ref> [1] </ref>. He uses temporal intervals as primitives in the logic. Therefore the representation of writing an article becomes: OCCU R (write article; t) where t stands for an interval.

Reference-contexts: Besides this formal point one can check that the two definitions are intuitively equivalent, although we cannot formally prove it. So, we have seen that the definition of the obligation as given in the temporal framework is basically compositional. That this is not trivial can be seen in <ref> [5] </ref> where this was attempted for actions in a temporal framework without obligations. We leave a more thorough investigation into this point for further research.

Reference-contexts: For instance, Thomason [33] uses a reduction of obligation to truth in all future courses of action/time that are morally acceptable, and Horty [23] considers a branching-time framework and defines obligations on the basis of the choices available to the agent and `stit' (seeing to it that) constructs (cf. <ref> [6] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: So, in order to represent the fact that an action has occurred we introduce DON E (ff) as a state predicate denoting that ff led to the state where it is evaluated. For a more extensive description of the logics, see <ref> [16] </ref>. The actions that are considered within the obligations can also be composite. The operators that combine the actions are + for a choice between actions, & for parallel execution of actions, for the negation of an action and ; for the sequence of actions. <p> To enable interpreting A, models should be extended to worlds connected by tree-relation rather than a linear one. Interpreted in a world, AOE requires that OE holds over all paths that leave that world. In the literature BTLdisc is known as CTL* (cf. <ref> [16] </ref>). BTLdisc syntax Definition 4.1 The set of BTLdisc formulas is defined inductively via the formation rules for LTLdisc formulas, extended with the following rule. 4. if OE is a formula, then so is AOE.

Reference-contexts: Van Eck's obligation may be viewed as a temporal variant of a (deontic) conditional, whereas our obligation operator has no such flavour. We will use a dynamic obligation based on the one defined in <ref> [26] </ref>. Also we try to add a temporal dimension to these dynamic obligations instead of expressing the obligations in terms of some temporal operators. This paper should be viewed as a first experiment with the combination of the notions of obligation and (branching) dense time. <p> will show how we can deal with this problem in the context of obligations although we will not give a general solution of this problem. 3 Discrete linear time temporal logic (LTLdisc) In this section we will start investigating how the concepts of dynamic deontic logic as defined in e.g. <ref> [26] </ref> can be expressed in a temporal framework. Although discrete linear time can be modeled based on a Kripke structure, the relations between worlds are no longer labeled (as they were in the dynamic logic model) with the actions.

Reference-contexts: Now the obligation on an action is represented in an atomic way: O (OCCU R (write article; t)); where we assume O to be a standard `ought-to-be' obligation operator (as in standard deontic logic, cf. e.g. <ref> [27] </ref>). However, we now have the problem that the obligation also seems to include the specific interval during which the action is supposed to occur. When is the above obligation violated? Formally this happens when :OCCU R (write article; t) is true. <p> For instance, If one ought to buy either apples or pears, one (normally) has neither an obligation to buy apples nor the obligation to buy pears. This is recognised in most deontic logics: in neither DDL nor SDL (Standard Deontic Logic, cf. e.g. <ref> [27] </ref>) this equivalence is valid. Intuitively, the reason why the distinction between the two case disappears for LTL is that in LTL the next moment is unique, and hence the formula X (' _ ) $ X' _ X (1) is valid.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, note that the branching part of the logic is completely analogous to the discrete case, i.e., the model is extended as before, the operator "A" is added likewise to the syntax. For a more extensive description of the logic, see <ref> [35] </ref>. Because the actions have a duration and we have dense time, we get a synchronization problem of actions as well. <p> Therefore the use of this framework does not alter our previous observations. Good descriptions of these logic can be found in <ref> [29, 35] </ref>. 6 Conclusions In this paper we have discussed the notion of ought-to-do obligation in the context of time.
