Abstract: With the arrival of terrestrial digital TV, a distribution network able to deliver up to 19 Mbits/s in each of the physical transmission channels will become available. Using the adopted data broadcast protocols, simultaneous transmission of multimedia documents to large population segments can be achieved. While these protocols describe methods for recognizing files in data streams, no method is known yet on how to distribute large collections of files in one or more data streams. This paper addresses this problem. The method proposed in the paper allocates objects in multiple streams according to their sizes and access probabilities, in such a way that average access latency is minimized. We show that the minimization problem can be described as a particular form of the NP hard quadratic allocation model for which an algorithmic solution for finding local minima exists.

Reference-contexts: With bandwidth being very likely the most important parameter in the determination of broadcast costs, methods as the one introduced here are needed for its efficient use in the deployment of future multimedia broadcast services. 2. DATA BROADCAST STREAMS The Transport Stream defined in the ATSC specifications <ref> [1] </ref> derived from the MPEG-2 Systems protocol [5, 6] is a digital channel supporting a throughput of 19.2 Mbits/s embedded in a 6 MHz band. The channel can itself be partitioned into multiple streams each of which uses a guaranteed portion of the total bandwidth.

Carlson and Nemhauser have proposed an optimization algo rithm for the CSP problem applicable when the coefficient matrix is symmetric with null diagonal <ref> [2] </ref>. Under these conditions, local minima can be found through a recursive process. However, for the stream allocation case, it is evident from Eqn. (10) that A is not symmetric and has, in general, a diagonal which is not null. <p> The matrix ~ A = [~a ik ] is symmetric with null diagonal, and therefore satisfies the conditions required for using the Carlson-Nemhauser algorithm. This algorithm was implemented as described in <ref> [2] </ref> with the only difference being the use of two starting feasible solutions. The algorithm calculated two optimal allocation matrices and selected the best of both. 6. APPLICATION EXAMPLE Consider the problem of finding the proper number of streams to use when broadcasting a large WWW document.

Reference-contexts: An important part for the development of multimedia transmission services is the standardization of data broadcasting. Both of the major players, DVB in Europe and ATSC in the United States, have agreed to use DSM-CC <ref> [7] </ref> as the base encapsulation protocol for such services. Files are modularized according to DSM-CC rules, and later packetized following the MPEG-2 Systems protocol. The resulting 188-byte packets are multiplexed with others sharing the same Transport Stream, and after channel encoding, they modulate pilot carriers using 8-VSB (See Fig. 1).
