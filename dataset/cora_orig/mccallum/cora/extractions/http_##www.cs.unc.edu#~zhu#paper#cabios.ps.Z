Abstract: We present algorithms for 3-D manipulation and conformational analysis of molecular chains, when bond length, bond angles and related dihedral angles remain fixed. These algorithms are useful for local deformations of linear molecules, exact ring closure in cyclic molecules and molecular embedding for short chains. Other possible applications include structure prediction, protein folding, conformation energy analysis and 3D molecular matching and docking. The algorithms are applicable to all serial molecular chains and make no asssumptions about their geometry. We make use of results on direct and inverse kinematics from robotics and mechanics literature and show the correspondence between kinematics and conforma-tional analysis of molecules. In particular, we pose these problems algebraically and compute all the solutions making use of the structure of these equations and matrix computations. The algorithms have been implemented and perform well in practice. In particular, they take tens of milliseconds on current workstations for local deformations and chain closures on molecular chains consisting of six or fewer rotatable dihedral angles.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, We also address the molecular embedding problem, that is, to find atom positions that satisfies a set of geometric constraints. It is an important problem in interpreting data from NMR experiment <ref> (Crippen,1989) </ref>. Many interactive systems for molecular modeling such as Sybyl (Tripos,1988) and Insight (Biosym,1991) provide capabilities for building and changing molecular models by rotating the dihedral angles. <p> In these cases it is assumed that the molecule is under no great strain, so that all bond lengths and bond angles are known from standard values taken from X-ray crystallographic studies on small molecules <ref> (Crippen,1989) </ref>. These constraints are referred to as holonomic constraints. The goal of the embedding algorithms is to find all conformations which satisfy these constraints. In this section, we show the equivalence between the embedding problems and inverse kinematics. <p> Given the experimental and holonomic constraints, the algorithm finds upper and lower bounds for all distances (which satisfy the constraints) and using some random values in this range it computes the closest corresponding three-dimensional metric matrix. Crippen has extended the algorithm using linearized embedding and taking chi-rality into account <ref> (Crippen,1989) </ref>. The overall process is iterative and may take considerable running time on some cases. Furthermore, even for small chains it is not guaranteed to compute all the configurations. We show the equivalence between molecular embedding and inverse kinematics for small chains.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, we only consider the inverse kinematics problem for serial chains with revolute joints. Initially, we consider chains with six rotatable joints (denoted as 6R) and later on extend the results to arbitrary chains. We use the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) formalism, <ref> (Denavit and Hartenberg,1955) </ref>, to model a serial chain based on DH formalism with n revolute joints. Each bond is represented by the line along its joint axis and the common normal to the next joint axis. In the case of parallel joints, any of the common normals can be chosen.

Reference-contexts: The resulting problem corresponds to solving three equations in three unknowns. Each equation has degree 6, however the highest degree term corresponds to x 2 3 x 2 5 . Such equations are solved using Dixon's formulation of resultant <ref> (Dixon,1908) </ref> and reducing the problem to eigendecomposition of a 48 fi 48 matrix, followed by back substitution. Extension to All Molecular Chains In the previous section we had considered molecular chains with six dihedral chains and reduced the problem to an eigendecomposition problem.

Reference-contexts: Given a particular geometry, we substitute the corresponding parameters. The parameters for the polypeptide geometry are highlighted in Section 5. It is possible that for some special geometries Q is rank deficient. As a result, we perform the rank computation after substitution using the singular-value decompositions (SVD) <ref> (Golub and Loan,1989) </ref>. If the rank, r, is less than 8 we only use r equations to eliminate the power products on the left hand side of (4) and thereby obtain (14 r) equations. Thus, the order of S in (5) is (14 r) fi 9.

Reference-contexts: These problems have been extensively studied in biochemistry and molecular modeling literature. Molecular chains are modeled using bond lengths, bond angles and dihedral angles. In the literature on conformational energy calculations, bond lengths and bond angles have been treated in two different ways, as variables or as fixed parameters <ref> (Go and Scherga,1970) </ref>. However, modeling the bond-length and bond-angle as variables significantly add to the complexity and even for small chains consisting of six or seven bonds, minimal energy computation becomes a non-trivial problem. <p> In their classic paper, Go and Scheraga highlight that the minimal energy conformations computed by fixing these parameters is a good guess to the actual minima and can be used along with a perturbation treatment for the energy minimization <ref> (Go and Scherga,1970) </ref>. Therefore, in this paper, we assume that the bond lengths and bond angles are fixed and compute the conformation of the molecular chains by changing the dihedral angles only. <p> Given the assumptions of fixed bond-lengths and bond-angles, two fundamental problems arise in con-formational energy calculations: ring closure and local conformational deformations <ref> (Go and Scherga,1970) </ref>. The problem of ring closure arises when we deal with cyclic molecules, i.e. the calculation of dihedral angles which corresponds to exact ring closure. <p> For cyclic molecules having rotatable bonds in the rings, six degrees of freedom are lost due to the closure constraint. Go and Scheraga have proposed solutions to computing the ring conformations (Go and Scherga,1970; Go and Scherga,1973). The algorithm in <ref> (Go and Scherga,1970) </ref> is restricted to molecular chains where the rotation can take place about all backbone bonds and the methods in (Go and Scherga,1973) are for symmetric chains only. They reduce the problem to computing roots of a univariate polynomial. <p> Cases of Rotation about All Backbone Bonds Go and Scheraga have considered a restricted version of the inverse kinematics problem, when the rotation can take place about all backbone bonds (as opposed to a few selected dihedral angles) <ref> (Go and Scherga,1970) </ref>. This turns out to be a special case of the inverse kinematics problem as well. In particular, the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters of such a chain correspond exactly to: a i = 0, d i = bond length and ff i = bond angle.

Reference-contexts: Go and Scheraga have proposed solutions to computing the ring conformations (Go and Scherga,1970; Go and Scherga,1973). The algorithm in (Go and Scherga,1970) is restricted to molecular chains where the rotation can take place about all backbone bonds and the methods in <ref> (Go and Scherga,1973) </ref> are for symmetric chains only. They reduce the problem to computing roots of a univariate polynomial. Algorithms based on distance geometry to study the ring systems are proposed in (Weiner et al.,1983; Peishoff and Dixon,1992). <p> In particular, all C-C bond lengths are fixed at 1.526 Angstrom, and C-C-C bond angles are fixed at 110.4 degree. Since we are only concerned with main chain conformation, the bond lengths and bond angles of C-H are irrelevant to our analysis. It was proved in <ref> (Go and Scherga,1973) </ref> that cyclohexane has infinite geometrically possible conformation due to its structural symmetry. In the following example, we slightly increase the length of the last bond. Since the symmetry no longer holds, we obtain a finite set of solutions.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, even for small chains it is not guaranteed to compute all the configurations. We show the equivalence between molecular embedding and inverse kinematics for small chains. It can be combined with model building techniques for application to larger chains as shown in <ref> (Leach and Smellie,1992) </ref>. Application to Small Chains In this section we will consider embeddings of molecular chains consisting of up to six rotatable bonds.

Reference-contexts: Using the procedure in section 2, Denavit Hartenberg parameters can be computed from the bond geometry. The end effector can be either computed from the original file or specified by the user, dependent on the application. In our example, we choose a segment of ff-helix from protein Felix <ref> (Richardson,1993) </ref>. Two orthogonal views of this segment are shown in Figure 9 (a). The Denavit Hartenberg parameters and the end effector are computed from the atom coordinates. The D-H parameters are listed in Table 7.

Reference-contexts: They use a distance matrix to generate a set of cartesian coordinates that satisfies the original set of distances as much as possible. A similar approach based on successive infinitesimal rotations is presented by <ref> (Sklenar et al.,1986) </ref>. Although these approaches make no assumption about the geometry of molecules, they are relatively slow in practice, may fail to converge and cannot be used for analytic computation of the conformation space for even small chains.

Reference-contexts: Molecular Modeling and Inverse Kinematics The inverse kinematics problem for general serial manipulators is fundamental for computer controlled robots. Given the pose of the end effector (the position and orientation), the problem corresponds to computing the joint displacements for that pose <ref> (Spong and Vidyasagar,1989) </ref>. A robot manipulator may consist of prismatic, revolute or spherical joints. A molecular chain with fixed bond lengths and bond angles corresponds to a serial manipulator with revolute joints. Therefore, we only consider the inverse kinematics problem for serial chains with revolute joints.

Reference-contexts: The matrix polynomial M (x 3 ) is regular if its symbolic determinant is non-zero. Otherwise it is a singular matrix polynomial. We are interested in computing the zeros of its determinant. For singular matrix polynomials it corresponds to computing the eigenvalues of the matrix polynomial <ref> (VanDooren and Dewilde,1983) </ref>. The following theorem shows how this problem of zero computation can be linearized, and the problem of inverse kinematics is reduced to computing appropriate zeros of a matrix pencil of the form, A xB (Manocha and Canny,1992; VanDooren and Dewilde,1983).

Reference-contexts: The main advantages of the matrix formulation are efficiency and accuracy. The reduction to a uni-variate polynomial involves expanding a symbolic determinant, which is relatively expensive. Moreover the problem of finding roots of polynomial of degree 16 can be numerically ill-conditioned <ref> (Wilkinson,1959) </ref>. As a result, we may not be able to compute accurate results using IEEE double precision arithmetic on current workstations.

Reference-contexts: Given a 6R manipulator with a pose of the end-effector, the maximum number of solutions (assuming a finite number of solutions) is 16 as shown in (Primrose,1986; Lee and Liang,1988; Raghavan and Roth). Practical methods to compute all the solutions are presented in <ref> (Wampler and Morgan,1991) </ref> based on continuation methods and in (Manocha and Canny,1992) based on matrix computations. In this section, we consider the problem of inverse kinematics for a molecular chain with six revolute joints. Chains with more than six joints or fewer than six joints are considered in next section.
