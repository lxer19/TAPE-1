Abstract: Simulated Annealing Search technique where a single trial solution is modified at random. An energy is defined which represents how good the solution is. The goal is to find the best solution by minimising the energy. Changes which lead to a lower energy are always accepted; an increase is probabilistically accepted. The probability is given by exp(E=k B T ). Where E is the change in energy, k B is a constant and T is the Temperature. Initially the temperature is high corresponding to a liquid or molten state where large changes are possible and it is progressively reduced using a cooling schedule so allowing smaller changes until the system solidifies at a low energy solution.
