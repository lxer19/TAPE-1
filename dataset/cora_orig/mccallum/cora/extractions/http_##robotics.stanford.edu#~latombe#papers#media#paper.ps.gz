Abstract: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a minimally invasive procedure that uses a focused beam of radiation as an ablative instrument to destroy brain tumors. To deposit a high dose of radiation in a tumor, while reducing the dose to healthy tissue, a large number of beams are crossfired at the tumor from multiple directions. The treatment planning problem (also called the inverse dosimetry problem) is to compute a set of beams that produces a desired dose distribution. So far, its investigation has focused on the generation of isocenter-based treatments in which the beam axes intersect at a common point, the isocenter. However, this restriction limits the applicability of the treatments to tumors having simple shapes. This paper describes carabeamer, a new treatment planner for a radiosurgical system in which the radiation source can be arbitrarily positioned and oriented by a six-degree-of-freedom manipulator. This planner uses randomized techniques to guess a promising initial set of beams. It then applies space partitioning and linear programming techniques to compute the energy to be delivered along each beam. Finally, it exploits the results of the linear program to iteratively adapt and improve the beam set. Experimental results obtained with carabeamer on both patient and synthetic cases are presented and discussed in this paper. These results demonstrate that a radiosurgical system with general kinematics can deliver treatments in which the region receiving high dose closely matches the shape of the tumor, even in complicated cases. They also suggest new research directions which are discussed at the end of the paper.

Reference-contexts: A treatment plan is defined as a set of weighted beams. Given a 3-D geometric model of a tissue area and a treatment plan, a direct dosimetry program must be available to simulate the treatment and estimate the dose that will be delivered throughout the brain <ref> [1] </ref>. This program is the reference used by the neurosurgeon to assess treatment plans. It incorporates precise models of the shape of a beam, of the intensity of a beam as it travels from the source, and of the absorption properties of the tissue. <p> Let be a cell of this arrangement and k 1 ; : : : ; k r (k r 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref> and r 0) the indices of the beams containing this cell.

Reference-contexts: In that case, most proposed systems require the user to specify a set of beams or, in some instances, the locations of a few isocenters from which beams can be derived. They then use optimization techniques, such as linear programming <ref> [4, 17, 24, 27] </ref>, quadratic programming [21, 22, 33], or simulated annealing [8, 23, 41], to determine the radiation energy to send along each beam to approximate the desired dose distribution as closely as possible.

Reference-contexts: Due to the complex behavior of carabeamer, it seems hard to formally prove this claim. One can nevertheless notice that similar randomized techniques have also been successfully used to plan collision-free robot motions in high-dimensional configuration spaces <ref> [5] </ref>. In that case, because obstacles divide the robot's configuration space into only two types of regions (collision and non-collision), it was possible to prove probabilistic completeness, as well as to relate the planner's running time to its probability of failure. 16 Extended-Planner: 1.

Instead, we lay a thin grid of specified resolution over the 14 3-D space of interest. The voxel matrices of the volume representation described in Subsection 3.1 are exactly aligned with this grid.

The resulting isocenter-based treatments are limited to tumors having relatively simple shapes. <p> In the ideal case where the tumor is roughly spherical, the isocenter is chosen at the centerpoint of the tumor, and the collimator diameter is set to the radius of the tumor. If a tumor is non-spherical, it may be approximated by multiple spheres <ref> [11] </ref>. However, switching between isocenters requires moving the patient relative to the gantry, which increases the total duration of the treatment. Typically, no more than five spheres are used to approximate the tumor shape; thus, the resulting treatment often yields a dose distribution with undesirable features.

Reference-contexts: For every i = 1; 2; : : :; r 1, Carabeamer creates a triangulation between T i and T i+1 . It then triangulates the two polygons T 1 and T r . The triangulation between T i and T i+1 is done using the algorithm proposed in <ref> [12] </ref>. The triangulations of T 1 and T r are done using the algorithm presented in [32]. But other techniques (producing different triangulations) could have been used as well.

Reference-contexts: Besides conducting further evaluation of the system, another goal of our current research is to explore the feasibility of applying carabeamer (and the CyberKnife system) to extracranial tumors. One major issue outside the brain is to reliably localize tissue structures. This localization problem can be dealt with for spine <ref> [18] </ref> and prostate tumors [37]. In those two cases, tissue of interest can be localized relative to nearby bone structures. This led us to experiment with carabeamer on several spine and prostate tumor cases.
