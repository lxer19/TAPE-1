Title: Page 1 A Hill-Climbing Technique for Optimizing Queue Depths with Regard to QoS  
Author: Marc A Donis Lundy Lewis Utpal Datta 
Keyword: Key words: switch, queuing, QoS, optimization, hill-climbing, ATM  
Affiliation: Cabletron Systems, Inc.  
Abstract: On each output port, a switch has a queue for every QoS level. This switch has a finite amount of available memory. The problem is to find a near-optimal set of queue depths which maximize the performance of the switch subject to a set of penalty parameters provided by the user and without exceeding the memory of the switch. Each QoS carries its own penalty for lost and delayed cells. The M/M/1/K queuing model is used to determine the cell loss rate and cell transfer delay. An objective cost function was derived. Several possible methods for optimizing this function were considered and discarded, and finally the hill-climbing approach was determined to be most feasible.

Reference-contexts: Growing demands for integrated services, such as video on demand, have created a need for ATM networks to support different levels of QoS, while making efficient use of network resources <ref> [1] </ref>. A variety of novel approaches have been taken to optimize ATM switching with regard to QoS, making use of neural networks [2, 3, 4, 5] and genetic algorithms [1, 6]. Much of this work has focused on call admission control using neural networks [7, 8, 9]. <p> A variety of novel approaches have been taken to optimize ATM switching with regard to QoS, making use of neural networks [2, 3, 4, 5] and genetic algorithms <ref> [1, 6] </ref>.

This work revolves around a switch currently being developed by Cabletron Systems for use in ATM networks. The switch will support various levels of QoS, maintaining a separate queue for each QoS on every port. Furthermore, the depths of these queues are adjustable.
