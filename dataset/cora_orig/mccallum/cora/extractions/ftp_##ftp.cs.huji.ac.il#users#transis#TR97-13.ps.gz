Reference-contexts: The drawback of using negative feedback is that when the network is congested, RM cells are more likely to be delayed or lost, leading the sessions to increase their rate further and cause more congestion. The PRCA (Proportional Rate Control Algorithm) <ref> [1] </ref>, was developed to address this problem among other problems. In this scheme positive feedback is used, i.e., the source receives RM cells when the network is uncongested. Thus, the source may increase its rate only when receiving RM cells, and decrease it otherwise. <p> Then for each k = 1; 2; 3:::: E (A k+1 ) E (A k ). Proof: Let be the set of possible values that may be retained by each of the random variables in fp i g 1 i=1 and let P = P p i : ! <ref> [0, 1] </ref> be the probability function for each p i such that for each ' 2 , P [p i = ']= ff ' , and P For every k = 1; 2; 3; ::: we define k to be the set of all vectors in &lt; k whose elements are

Reference-contexts: Usually the convergence time is much smaller 7 . The EPRCA (Enhanced Proportional Rate Control Algorithm) presented in <ref> [2] </ref>, combines the one-bit and explicit-rate feedback schemes. Unlike PRCA, in EPRCA the source emits an RM cell N rm th data cell. This cell is sent towards the destination and then reflected by the destination back to the source. <p> Only minor changes are needed in the source's algorithm in order to translate the price-based feedback into explicit rate. The protocol may also work in conjunction with existing one-bit feedback protocols as suggested in <ref> [2] </ref>, although this option is not implemented in the protocol presented here. It should be noted however, that the protocol is not bound to the ABR specifications or to ATM at all.

Reference-contexts: This is done by allowing the target load be increased if queue length decreases and vice-versa. ERICA + also considers interaction between ABR and VBR traffic when sharing the same link. * In the Phantom scheme <ref> [3] </ref>, the MACR is measured as the unused link capacity averaged over time. The switch measures the MACR directly and not through RM cells received from the sessions. If the queue length exceeds a certain threshold, the MACR measurement is biased downwards. <p> We start by simulating configurations with unicast sessions only, in which there are no multicast switches. These simulations test the basic behavior of the protocol and the obtained results may be compared with many other results obtained by other existing rate allocation schemes (see for example <ref> [34, 36, 3] </ref>). We then test the protocol in the presence of multicast sessions. 73 6.1 One Link Topology In the first simulation suite, we test the basic behavior of the protocol in a simple configuration in which a set of unicast sessions share a single link. <p> Queue length of link #4. 6.6 Summary of Network Simulation Results The results presented in this chapter indicate that the protocol behaves well in various network conditions. Its performance is not inferior to existing network allocation protocols that produce the max-min fair allocation for unicast sessions (see for example <ref> [3, 34, 36] </ref>). When few sessions are active, and almost no delay is present, the convergence of the protocol lasts a few milliseconds. Increasing delay slows convergence proportionally, as expected. The protocol also handles well transient and bursty sessions. <p> By having each link charge a price of 1 r , where r is the current residual link capacity, the stamp mechanism for controlling price updates may be spared. If r is measured using techniques such as suggested in <ref> [3] </ref>, then a constant-space 98 memory may suffice at least in non-multicast switches. <p> Note that in the M/M/1 queuing model, this pricing scheme along with the equi-length endowment allocation allocates each session a rate that is the inverse of its average per-link delay (instead of the inverse of the maximum link delay, as proposed in <ref> [3] </ref>). Note also that as with the max-min fair allocation variation suggested in [16, 3], this scheme also forces a portion of the link capacity to remain unused, thus reducing delay and queue buildup. <p> Note also that as with the max-min fair allocation variation suggested in <ref> [16, 3] </ref>, this scheme also forces a portion of the link capacity to remain unused, thus reducing delay and queue buildup. The drawback of this scheme is that it does not converge through the natural economic price-demand reaction process 2 and special measures to control demand must be taken. <p> In preliminary experiments we have performed with this scheme, we observed improved network utilization when compared with the corresponding max-min fair allocation variation <ref> [16, 3] </ref>. By charging a price of 1 kr where k &gt;1, higher link utilization may be achieved. A most interesting observation we have acquired in these experiments, is that when we allowed k to approach infinity, the resulting allocation approached the allocation achieved through the tatonement price-update process.

Reference-contexts: It should be mentioned that initial effort has also been put into multipoint-to-point (or many-to-one) connection flow control. This type of connection is not yet implemented in ATM. The main problem is that cells that belong to different packets of higher level layers (such as AAL5 <ref> [4] </ref>), and originate at different senders cannot be distinguished at merging switches 8 . In [31] it is suggested that switches maintain packet-level queuing in order to solve this problem. The flow control mechanism is an extension of the EPRCA/APRC schemes.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, when many sessions share a link, the amount of free capacity will be reduced and delay will increase. Thus, some allocation schemes (such as suggested in <ref> [5, 19] </ref>) allow some constant percentage of the link to remain unallocated. In [13] a survey of different fairness indices is given. Fairness schemes are categorized according to the criteria they enforce. Three categories are specified: fair resource utilization, equal performance and balanced interference among users.

Reference-contexts: Thus, a long session will have an advantage over a shorter session if they traverse the same number of congested links. 1.5.2 Fairness and Optimality in the ABR Service in ATM The services offered by ATM can be divided into five categories, as described in <ref> [6] </ref>: 1. CBR: Constant Bit Rate. <p> Perhaps the number of hops or the number of receivers will be considered as well. The specifications of the ABR service that appear in <ref> [6] </ref> do not require the use of a specific fairness criterion. The max-min fairness criterion is only recommended there as a possible solution. Other variations of fairness that are suggested there consider the MCR allocated to the sessions. The following fairness criteria are suggested: 1. <p> At the time of the composition of this work, only preliminary steps have been taken by the ATM Forum in order to adapt the EPRCA scheme for operating with point-to-multipoint multicast sessions <ref> [6] </ref>. This adaptation is mainly meant to solve technical problems, such as how to regulate the amount of feedback returned to the source and how to ignore unresponsive destinations in order to avoid fast rate degradation. The actual rate allocation principle remains unaltered by these adaptations. <p> Thus, the resulting rate allocation remains max-min fair. A formalization of the max-min fairness criteria in the existence of multicast sessions is given in [35]. Some basic performance evaluation of EPRCA with cell consolidation is also given there. In <ref> [6] </ref>, cell consolidation had been recommended for future handling of multicast sessions in the ABR Service. In addition, it is recommended that a branch of a multicast session will be allowed to be marked as `non-responding' if no backward RM cells are returned from it. <p> This approach spares the necessity of detecting network-wide equilibrium since no special action is taken once equilibrium is reached. In the protocol implementation we present here we have chosen to keep the data exchange as similar as possible to the protocol that is suggested by the ATM Forum in <ref> [6] </ref>. Thus, data is transmitted in cells (53 bytes long) and control messages are sent in the form of Resource Management (RM) cells every 32 data cells. These cells are reverted at the destination and sent back to the source. <p> Thus, we shall use the terms `data cells' and `RM cells' in the protocol description. The protocol may optionally be used as a mechanism to calculate `explicit rate' feedback in the framework of the ABR service specification <ref> [6] </ref>. Only minor changes are needed in the source's algorithm in order to translate the price-based feedback into explicit rate. The protocol may also work in conjunction with existing one-bit feedback protocols as suggested in [2], although this option is not implemented in the protocol presented here. <p> Dealing with multicast sessions requires special treatment. The implementation of the ABR protocol for multicast sessions is still in its early stages in the ATM Forum and only an outline of the requirements is suggested in <ref> [6] </ref>. We have tried to follow these guidelines in places relevant to the protocol. We have relied on the idea of message consolidation in branching switches of multicast sessions as suggested in [33] and described in Section 1.5.4.

Reference-contexts: will be always bounded by the number of active sessions. 17 similar to that in EPRCA, except that congested is measured in the switches not by the absolute queue length but by the amount of change in the queue length. * In the CAPC scheme (Congested Avoidance Using Proportional Control, <ref> [7] </ref>), A target link utilization of 95% is set. Whenever this target is exceeded, the MACR (termed there ERS, or Explicit Rate for Switch) is reduced. Otherwise, the MACR may be increased. The modification of the MACR is done in proportion to the relative overload or under-load.

Reference-contexts: In order to be optimal, a rate allocation must utilize network resources as much as possible without obstructing the fairness goal. The criterion most widely used to achieve fairness in rate allocation is the max-min fairness criterion, presented in various versions in <ref> [8, 10, 16] </ref> and other places. Max-min fairness attempts to allocate equal rates to all active sessions. However, this is often impossible because of link capacity limitations.

Reference-contexts: In the rest of this section, a brief description of the different schemes and terms relating to the rate-based scheme is given. For a more elaborate description of terminology and development of the rate-based scheme, the reader is referred to <ref> [9] </ref>. The main effort of all schemes described here, is to allocate rates according to some variation of the max-min fair allocation. The rate-based flow control algorithms can be roughly divided into two groups, according to the type of feedback they supply: binary (one-bit) feedback and explicit rate feedback.

Reference-contexts: In order to be optimal, a rate allocation must utilize network resources as much as possible without obstructing the fairness goal. The criterion most widely used to achieve fairness in rate allocation is the max-min fairness criterion, presented in various versions in <ref> [8, 10, 16] </ref> and other places. Max-min fairness attempts to allocate equal rates to all active sessions. However, this is often impossible because of link capacity limitations. <p> To give a better intuition of how this allocation is achieved we follow the definition of a max-min fair allocation as given in <ref> [10] </ref>: we define a bottleneck link as a link in which the ratio between the capacity of the link and the number of the sessions passing through this link has a minimal value in comparison to all the other links. <p> For simplicity of presentation we may sometimes refer to a link as if it manages its own resources. 4 As mentioned earlier, this property is also true for the max-min fair allocation as presented in <ref> [10] </ref>. 9 1.4.1 The Network Bandwidth Economy and Prioritization In the framework of the network economy presented above, the allocation of initial endowments can be used directly to give priorities to sessions: sessions with a higher endowment have more `buying power' and thus can demand more resources from the network. <p> As a result, the overall rate increase when the network is uncongested, is also proportional to the total overall current rate and does not depend on the number of active sessions. Two main problems have been found in the binary feedback schemes presented above: 1. As stated in <ref> [10] </ref>, although the one-bit indication algorithms have been shown to be fair and efficient, there is no theoretical proof that they converge to max-min fairness in complex topologies. Also, since feedback holds minimal information (one bit), convergence to optimum might take a long time. 2. <p> This phenomenon is referred to as the `beat down' problem (in [36] for example). To solve these problems, explicit rate feedback schemes have been proposed. In <ref> [10] </ref> a distributed algorithm for calculating the max-min fairness allocation using explicit rate indication is presented. In this algorithm, the source of a session adjusts its rate according to the explicit rate indicated on the feedback RM cells. <p> When the source receives the RM cell, it adjusts its rate to the 16 CCR on the cell. If the advertized rates of all switches on the session's route are larger than the session's CCR, the source may increase its rate. It has been analytically proved in <ref> [10] </ref> that this algorithm is guaranteed to converge. Moreover, given that there are N active sessions and the RTT of all sessions is bounded by D, the algorithm will converge within a time of 4N D since the last time a session has entered or exited. <p> The synthesis of the one-bit and explicit feedback schemes enables co-operation of simple switches that can supply only one-bit feedback, with more complex switches. The EPRCA approach is currently adopted by the ATM Forum. The main drawback of the explicit rate scheme as presented in <ref> [10] </ref>, is that it requires per-session accounting in order to maintain the advertized rate. Thus, the amount of memory required by the switch relies on the number of sessions that pass through it, and is not constant. <p> The feedback supplied by the economy is in the form of prices, and not one-bit or explicit feedback. Thus, although the feedback does not consist of precise information, as in <ref> [10] </ref>, it holds more information than the one-bit feedback. As the results in Chapter 6 indicate, the convergence speed of the economic algorithm is not inferior to the convergence speed of other existing algorithms. <p> Sessions try to maximize their transmission rates. Although this is not always the case in real networks, we can circumvent this by emulating sessions with limited rate demands as sessions limited at the entrance to the network by links of limited capacity (as suggested in <ref> [10] </ref>). 1 We shall refer to this point again in the context of actual protocol implementation in Chapter 5. 22 2.1.1 Switch Operation We assume that the packets of each session are serviced by the switches in fifo order.

Reference-contexts: The use of the ABR service will obviously be cheap in relation to the CBR and the VBR services. There are several suggestions for pricing systems <ref> [11, 12, 28] </ref> that enable to set prices to different classes of network services. Other proposals exist for dynamic pricing [12, 14], in which prices are set directly according to the congestion level and users are charged for the effective bandwidth they use.

Reference-contexts: This is unfair and may also lead to network under-utilization. In this work we present a novel rate allocation scheme that increases the expected (average) rates allocated to multicast and long unicast sessions, and improves overall network utilization. The scheme relies on the economic paradigm, suggested in <ref> [12] </ref>. This model views the network as an economy in which the communication links act as suppliers of resources and the active sessions act as consumers. <p> A simpler solution is found in the framework of the Network Economy model presented next. 1.4 The Network Economy Model The network economy model presented by Ferguson, Nikolau and Yemini in <ref> [12] </ref> supplies an alternative framework for rate allocation. This model views the network as a competitive economy in which links are suppliers of resources and sessions are consumers. <p> A link can stop modifying its price when the total demand presented by all the sessions passing through the link equals the total amount of resources the link dedicates to these sessions. By relying on economic theory, it is shown in <ref> [12] </ref> that for any given topology and session configuration, there exists a set of prices that yields an equilibrium state. <p> This could be done for example through a billing mecha nism. In addition, as discussed in <ref> [12] </ref> the routing mechanisms should be kept external to the bandwidth economy and should not be allowed to modify session paths according to endowment/pricing in consideration. <p> The use of the ABR service will obviously be cheap in relation to the CBR and the VBR services. There are several suggestions for pricing systems <ref> [11, 12, 28] </ref> that enable to set prices to different classes of network services. Other proposals exist for dynamic pricing [12, 14], in which prices are set directly according to the congestion level and users are charged for the effective bandwidth they use. <p> The use of the ABR service will obviously be cheap in relation to the CBR and the VBR services.

Other proposals exist for dynamic pricing <ref> [12, 14] </ref>, in which prices are set directly according to the congestion level and users are charged for the effective bandwidth they use. However it is not clear whether users will actually be charged according to such prices because of the dynamic nature of these prices 6 . <p> We do not deal with many-to-one connections in this work. 21 Chapter 2 The Network Bandwidth Economy In this section we present a formal description of the Bandwidth Economy. This economy is a simplified version of the economy presented in <ref> [12] </ref>. 2.1 The Network and Multicast Model The network is modeled as an undirected connected graph G (V; E) in which each node v is either a switch or an endpoint and each edge l = (u; v) is a link connecting u and v. <p> In <ref> [12] </ref> it is proved that for every session s and a given price vector ~p, D s (~p) contains a single vector ~r s whose elements are: * r l Q s , if l 2 e s s = 0, if l 62 e s i.e., s presents equal demands <p> A price vector p fl at which equilibrium is achieved is called an equilibrium price vector and the rate allocation ~r (p fl ) resulting from p fl is called an equilibrium allocation. In <ref> [12] </ref> it is proved that for any given network topology and session configuration, there exists at least one equilibrium price vector (and a resulting equilibrium allocation). It is also proved that the equilibrium allocation is Pareto-optimal. <p> It should 25 be noted however, that no example for multiple equilibrium allocations has been found in simulations made either in <ref> [12] </ref> or in the framework of this work. 2.5 Transient Conditions In a real network environment, it is reasonable to assume that the set of active sessions will not remain constant. Sessions may enter and exit at any time. <p> In this simulation set, network delay is ignored. Demand calculations made by the sessions and price adjustments made by the links are made in synchronous steps. The price adjustment scheme used is the tatonement process, as suggested in <ref> [12] </ref>. As will be discussed below, this algorithm was shown to provide fast convergence to equilibrium and quick reaction to transient events. <p> If equilibrium is reached, stop. Otherwise go back to step 2. We have used in our simulations ff = 0:8 and " = 0:0001. The simulation results presented in <ref> [12] </ref> show that when using this algorithm in networks of realistic size, the general network economy arrives within a range of 2% from the equilibrium allocation after 25 iterations. This number does not depend on the mean session length.

Max-min fairness falls under the first category because bottleneck resources are shared fairly among users.

Reference-contexts: A session detects that the economy approaches equilibrium when the standard deviation of the demand becomes small. The standard deviation of the demand is estimated by the mean deviation as suggested in <ref> [15] </ref> as follows: = (1 h) + h jcur demand prev demandj, where prev demand is the previous demand and 0 &lt; h &lt; 1. Using this value of , we allow the rate to have the minimum value of cur rate = cur demand ( 1 h 1) .

Reference-contexts: In order to be optimal, a rate allocation must utilize network resources as much as possible without obstructing the fairness goal. The criterion most widely used to achieve fairness in rate allocation is the max-min fairness criterion, presented in various versions in <ref> [8, 10, 16] </ref> and other places. Max-min fairness attempts to allocate equal rates to all active sessions. However, this is often impossible because of link capacity limitations. <p> The third definition guarantees a positive allocation to all sessions. Thus, it is `fair' in the sense that it allows network access to all sessions (but without performance guarantees). The bottleneck or max-min fair flow control scheme presented in <ref> [16] </ref> concentrates on fair and optimal allocation of rates. In order to avoid formation of infinite delay, a fraction of the link capacity is always kept unallocated. <p> The switch measures the MACR directly and not through RM cells received from the sessions. If the queue length exceeds a certain threshold, the MACR measurement is biased downwards. By limiting the MACR to the amount of unused bandwidth, the allocation achieved is the same as proposed in <ref> [16] </ref>. In order to increase utilization, a utilization factor k may be specified, so that session rates are restricted to k * MACR instead of MACR. The economic scheme for rate allocation presented in this work does not fall in the existing categories of rate based scheme. <p> Note also that as with the max-min fair allocation variation suggested in <ref> [16, 3] </ref>, this scheme also forces a portion of the link capacity to remain unused, thus reducing delay and queue buildup. The drawback of this scheme is that it does not converge through the natural economic price-demand reaction process 2 and special measures to control demand must be taken. <p> In preliminary experiments we have performed with this scheme, we observed improved network utilization when compared with the corresponding max-min fair allocation variation <ref> [16, 3] </ref>. By charging a price of 1 kr where k &gt;1, higher link utilization may be achieved. A most interesting observation we have acquired in these experiments, is that when we allowed k to approach infinity, the resulting allocation approached the allocation achieved through the tatonement price-update process.

In <ref> [17] </ref> a few possibilities are mentioned: 1. Response-Time/Delay: For real-time applications such as video conferencing, response time is a crucial Quality of service (QoS) parameter. 2. Throughput: For data applications such as file transfer, a high throughput guarantee is important. 3.

Reference-contexts: The MACR is set to the maximum between the fair share, and CCR/TL, where CCR is the value in the ER field of the incoming backward RM cell.

Reference-contexts: A high performance in terms of throughput comes on the expense of delay performance.

These contradict ing effects lead to the combined performance measure known as power. Using the above notations, the power measured at a single link is calculated as fi d , where fi is a constant used to quantify the desired relative effect of throughput against delay. <p> This measure can also apply to a session instead of a single link, where is the session's throughput and d is the session's total delay. The power concept is thoroughly discussed in <ref> [20] </ref>. Three global performance measures based on power are proposed there: 1. (sum of session throughputs) fi /average session delay. 2. sum of powers of all sessions. 3. product of powers of all sessions.

Reference-contexts: The solution to this problem is still open for future research.

In this work it is argued that a session that traverses many links in a wide-area network is bound to suffer from a higher cell-loss probability and thus from a lower throughput.

Reference-contexts: Two of the earlier proposals to the ATM Forum were the Forward Explicit Congestion Notification (FECN) [40] scheme and the Explicit Congestion Notification (BECN) <ref> [27] </ref> scheme. In the FECN scheme, each data cell holds an Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI). Switches indicate congestion by marking a bit on data cells traveling downstream. The destination checks every predefined interval if the bit on the most recently received data cell had been set. <p> The sessions in these groups are the shortest are have the lowest RTT. The sessions in group B are even entitled to the highest rate allocation. In other rate allocation protocols (especially in one-bit marking schemes such as <ref> [27, 40] </ref>), these sessions are likely to be the fastest to achieve their fair share and even get more that their fair on the expense of the longer sessions. This is because they are able to react fast and thus can utilize any free capacity while remaining `well behaved'.

Reference-contexts: The use of the ABR service will obviously be cheap in relation to the CBR and the VBR services. There are several suggestions for pricing systems <ref> [11, 12, 28] </ref> that enable to set prices to different classes of network services. Other proposals exist for dynamic pricing [12, 14], in which prices are set directly according to the congestion level and users are charged for the effective bandwidth they use.

Reference-contexts: In binary feedback algorithms, the source periodically receives a single bit, on a control message (or in some cases, piggybacked on backward direction data packet as in <ref> [29] </ref>), which indicates whether there is congestion in the network. Two of the earlier proposals to the ATM Forum were the Forward Explicit Congestion Notification (FECN) [40] scheme and the Explicit Congestion Notification (BECN) [27] scheme. In the FECN scheme, each data cell holds an Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI).

Reference-contexts: The rate-based scheme on the other hand operates with an end-to-end loop. The source of the session receives explicit or implicit feedback that directs the source in what rate it is allowed to transmit. The advantage of the credit-based scheme, as described in <ref> [30] </ref>, is that the credit-based scheme's hop-by-hop accounting allows for faster reaction of the algorithm to transient network conditions. On the other hand, the credit-based scheme demands more complex hardware because it requires per-session queuing in the switches.

Reference-contexts: This type of connection is not yet implemented in ATM. The main problem is that cells that belong to different packets of higher level layers (such as AAL5 [4]), and originate at different senders cannot be distinguished at merging switches 8 . In <ref> [31] </ref> it is suggested that switches maintain packet-level queuing in order to solve this problem. The flow control mechanism is an extension of the EPRCA/APRC schemes. Whenever a backward RM cell is received, it is processed and discarded as in in the cell consolidation scheme.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the amount of memory required by the switch relies on the number of sessions that pass through it, and is not constant. To bypass this problem, as well as the unfairness caused by the binary feedback scheme, an intelligent marking scheme has been added to the EPRCA proposal <ref> [32] </ref>. This scheme uses approximizations to calculate the advertized rate (also referred to as the Maximum Allowed Rate or MACR) without per-session accounting. The tradeoff of using such a scheme is a somewhat longer convergence time.

Reference-contexts: This is not only a waste of bandwidth, but may also distort the source's incremental reactions to binary feedback. In order to avoid this, the cell consolidation scheme has been suggested <ref> [33] </ref>. In this proposal, switches, sources and destinations behave the same as in the regular EPRCA scheme. Only branching switches, i.e., switches that need to multicast the cells of a session to more than one destination, alter their behavior. <p> This scheme is relatively complex because it requires per-session queuing in output ports. Reference [38] elaborates on the rate-based scheme that should be used with the scheme described in [37]. The scheme is similar to the one described in <ref> [33] </ref> but differs in two major aspects. First of all, the explicit rate option is not used, and only one-bit feedback is considered. <p> We have tried to follow these guidelines in places relevant to the protocol. We have relied on the idea of message consolidation in branching switches of multicast sessions as suggested in <ref> [33] </ref> and described in Section 1.5.4. <p> There too, the behavior of the session's source depends on the rate of the incoming backward RM cells, when adjusting the rate according to the one-bit feedback on the RM cell. To solve these problems, we adapt cell consolidation concept suggested in <ref> [33] </ref>. Each switch sw that serves as a branching point for a multicast session s maintains aggregated information for all the downstream links residing on the subtree of s's multicast tree whose root is sw 4 .

The ATM Forum Traffic Management Subworking Group., </title> <month> October </month> <year> 1994. </year> <title> An ATM Forum Contribution 94-0888. </title>
Reference-contexts: Several variations on intelligent marking and constant-space explicit rate algorithms have been proposed. These schemes attempt to estimate the MACR without per-session accounting. Here we mention a few of these schemes: * The APRC (Adaptive Proportional Rate Control) proposal presented in <ref> [34] </ref> is very 7 N actually stands for the number of iterations needed by a synchronous algorithm as described in Section 1.1 to converge. <p> We start by simulating configurations with unicast sessions only, in which there are no multicast switches. These simulations test the basic behavior of the protocol and the obtained results may be compared with many other results obtained by other existing rate allocation schemes (see for example <ref> [34, 36, 3] </ref>). We then test the protocol in the presence of multicast sessions. 73 6.1 One Link Topology In the first simulation suite, we test the basic behavior of the protocol in a simple configuration in which a set of unicast sessions share a single link. <p> Queue length of link #4. 6.6 Summary of Network Simulation Results The results presented in this chapter indicate that the protocol behaves well in various network conditions. Its performance is not inferior to existing network allocation protocols that produce the max-min fair allocation for unicast sessions (see for example <ref> [3, 34, 36] </ref>). When few sessions are active, and almost no delay is present, the convergence of the protocol lasts a few milliseconds. Increasing delay slows convergence proportionally, as expected. The protocol also handles well transient and bursty sessions.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the resulting rate allocation remains max-min fair. A formalization of the max-min fairness criteria in the existence of multicast sessions is given in <ref> [35] </ref>. Some basic performance evaluation of EPRCA with cell consolidation is also given there. In [6], cell consolidation had been recommended for future handling of multicast sessions in the ABR Service.

Reference-contexts: As a session traverses more congested links, more of its data cells will be marked, causing it to decrease its rate even below its fair share. This phenomenon is referred to as the `beat down' problem (in <ref> [36] </ref> for example). To solve these problems, explicit rate feedback schemes have been proposed. In [10] a distributed algorithm for calculating the max-min fairness allocation using explicit rate indication is presented. <p> We start by simulating configurations with unicast sessions only, in which there are no multicast switches. These simulations test the basic behavior of the protocol and the obtained results may be compared with many other results obtained by other existing rate allocation schemes (see for example <ref> [34, 36, 3] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: In addition, it is recommended that a branch of a multicast session will be allowed to be marked as `non-responding' if no backward RM cells are returned from it. A `non-responding' branch may be ignored during the determination of transmission rates, until feedback is received from that branch. In <ref> [37] </ref>, the problem of network under-utilization caused by multicast sessions is addressed. As in this work, it is argued that unequal congestion level in a multicast session's branches prevents utilizing the free branches, both in the rate-based and the credit based 19 schemes. <p> This scheme is relatively complex because it requires per-session queuing in output ports. Reference [38] elaborates on the rate-based scheme that should be used with the scheme described in <ref> [37] </ref>. The scheme is similar to the one described in [33] but differs in two major aspects. First of all, the explicit rate option is not used, and only one-bit feedback is considered.

The capacity of all links connecting the switches is 151 Mb/s. The delay in the links connecting the switches is 1 ms while the delay in the rest of the links is negligible (0.001 ms).
