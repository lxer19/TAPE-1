Abstract: In this paper we study the structure of finitely presented Heyting algebras. Using algebraic techniques (as opposed to techniques from proof-theory) we show that every such Heyting algebra is in fact co-Heyting, improving on a result of Ghilardi who showed that Heyting algebras free on a finite set of generators are co-Heyting. Along the way we give a new and simple proof of the finite model property. Our main technical tool is a representation of finitely presented Heyting algebras in terms of a colimit of finite distributive lattices. As applications we construct explicitly the minimal join-irreducible elements (the atoms) and the maximal join-irreducible elements of a finitely presented Heyting algebras in terms of a given presentation. This gives as well a new proof of the disjunction property for intuitionistic propositional logic. Unfortunately not very much is known about the structure of Heyting algebras, although it is understood that implication causes the complex structure of Heyting algebras. Just to name an example, the free Boolean algebra on one generator has four elements, the free Heyting algebra on one generator is infinite. Our research was motivated by a simple application of Pitts' uniform interpolation theorem [12]. Combining it with the old analysis of Heyting algebras free on a finite set of generators by Urquhart [14] we get a faithful functor f:p: ! PoSet; sending a finitely presented Heyting algebra to the partially ordered set of its join-irreducible elements, and a map between Heyting algebras to its left-adjoint restricted to join-irreducible elements. We will explore on the induced duality more detailed in [5]. Let us briefly browse through the contents of this paper: The first section recapitulates the basic notions, mainly that of the implicational degree of an element in a Heyting algebra. This is a notion relative to a given set of generators. In the next section we study finite Heyting algebras. Our contribution is a simple proof of the finite model property which names in particular a canonical family of finite Heyting algebras into which we can embed a given finitely presented one. In Section 3 we recapitulate the standard duality between finite distributive lattices and finite posets. The `new' feature here is a strict categorical formulation which helps simplifying some proofs and avoiding calculations. In the following section we recapitulate the description given by Ghilardi [8] on how to adjoin implications to a finite distributive lattice, thereby not destroying a given set of implications. This construction will be our major technical ingredient in Section 5 where we show that every finitely presented Heyting algebra is co-Heyting, i.e., that the operation () n () dual to implication is defined. This result improves on Ghilardi's [8] that this is true for Heyting algebras free on a finite set of generators. Then we go on analysing the structure of finitely presented Heyting algebras in Section 6. We show that every element can be expressed as a finite join of join-irreducibles, and calculate

Reference-contexts: In fact, J (D 0 x ) = Pfx 0 ; : : : ; x n1 g, ordered by reverse inclusion. Note that the minimal elements in J (HA [x]) are nothing but the atoms in HA [x], and this number was as well calculated in <ref> [2] </ref>, Theorem 3.0 (i). There is exactly one maximal element in J (D 0 x ), namely &gt;. This means as well that in HA [x] there is one maximal join-irreducible element.

Reference-contexts: ! H 0 are nothing but Heyting algebra morphisms H !

After these general remarks we restrict ourselves to the full sub-category D fin of D containing those objects ff 1;0 : D 1 ! D 0 where D 1 and D 0 are finite.

Reference-contexts: X) j &gt; j ? j t ^ t 0 j t _ t 0 j t ! t 0 ; and the equivalence relation is provability in intuitionistic propositional logic, that is, t and t 0 are equivalent if ` i t $ t 0 . (We refer to <ref> [6] </ref> for a possible axiomatisation.) We use the usual abbreviations :t for t ! ? and t $ t 0 for (t ! t 0 ) ^ (t 0 ! t), the latter we already used above. <p> As is well known, this holds more generally for all finitely presented Heyting algebras. The usual proof uses the completeness theorem of intuitionistic propositional logic with respect to Kripke models, and then one has to show that finite Kripke models suffice (see for example <ref> [6] </ref>). We will give a simple algebraic proof in the next section. 2 Finite Heyting algebras and the finite model property In this section our fixed data is a representation O: HA [x] i H of some finitely presented Heyting algebra H.

Reference-contexts: Proof. The proposition just restates the well known fact that a finite distributive lattice is com pletely determined by its join-irreducible elements. See for example <ref> [7] </ref> for details.

Reference-contexts: Ghilardi. Since it is of vital importance for us, we will recapitulate its description, and refer the reader for a proof of its properties to <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> Finally, we see that J (r g ) is co-open, so that r g is a map of co-Heyting algebras. We summarise this in the following proposition: Proposition 4.3 (Ghilardi, see <ref> [8] </ref>.) Let g: D 0 ! D be a morphism between finite distributive lattices. <p> g ) is an arbitrary join-irreducible element such that for all p =2 S the inequality T p ! fl D (p) holds, then p =2 S implies p =2 T by the first part, so that T ae S and thus T S. (This equation is already mentioned in <ref> [8] </ref>.) To verify the second identity of the lemma we have for p 2 S that S 6 p ! fl D (p), so p ! fl D (p) fl D g (S) which proves one inequality.

Reference-contexts: The two ranks differ by at most one, and each of them has its advantages and disadvantages. 3 speaking we only showed that the rank is bounded by n + 1. Using that the free Heyting algebra on one generator is infinite ([1], pp. 182-185, <ref> [11] </ref>, p. 35) one shows that the rank equals n + 1.) The above example shows slightly more: n D n x , which is the composite D n O // HA [x] // // D n say as a map of distributive lattices, is the identity on D n x <p> Since fl D n (p) is meet-irreducible and p 6 fl D n (p) the same calculation as above proves the second equality. 2 Example 7.5 From the explicit description of the free Heyting algebra on one generator (see for example <ref> [11] </ref>, p. 35) one easily calculates that 0 (x) = ::x; 2 (x) = (::x ! x) ! (x _ :x) and for example 0 (x; y) = ::(x ^ y) ^ (x ! y) ! y ^ (y ! x) ! x.

Reference-contexts: Corollary 5.6 (Rauszer <ref> [13] </ref>.) Bi-intuitionistic logic is conservative over intuitionistic logic. Proof. Algebraically this just says that the canonical map from the free Heyting algebra on count-ably many generators into the free bi-Heyting algebra on this set of generators is an inclusion.

The first part of the following proposition is known for Heyting algebras, free on a finite set of generators (see for example <ref> [14] </ref>).
