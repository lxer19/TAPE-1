Abstract: The weak Konig's lemma WKL is of crucial significance in the study of fragments of mathematics which on the one hand are mathematically strong but on the other hand have a low proof-theoretic and computational strength. In addition to the restriction to binary trees (or equivalently bounded trees), WKL is also `weak' in that the tree predicate is quantifier-free. Whereas in general the computational and proof-theoretic strength increases when logically more complex trees are allowed, we show that this is not the case for trees which are given by formulas in a class 1 where we allow an arbitrary function quantifier prefix over bounded functions in front of a 0 1 -formula. This results in a schema 1 -WKL.
