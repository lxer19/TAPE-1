Abstract: The results of Section 5 are of this sort. One sometimes hears the question: Is a GA more powerful than an equal population of hill-climbers, and if so, why? The answer seems to be yes, as noted. But why? Perhaps the basic reason is that the hill-climber can get tripped up by an individual case, whereas on a problem that is GA-easy but not SAO, the GA is carried over such cases by the statistical power of the schema theorem. Note also that each of a population of hill-climbers is likely to get stuck somewhere, but in different places than its neighbors. In a problem like the one constructed in this paper, each hill-climber will at the same time be correct in a number of places (in the string), again at different places than its neighbors. Crossover would permit the good parts to be communicated and accumulated. But only the GA has crossover.
