Abstract: We analyze the queueing behavior of long-tailed traffic sources under the Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) discipline. GPS-based scheduling algorithms, such as Weighted Fair Queueing, have emerged as important mechanisms for accommodating heterogeneous quality-of-service requirements in integrated-services networks. Under mild stability conditions, we show that the tail behavior of the buffer content of an individual source with long-tailed traffic characteristics is equivalent to the tail behavior when that source is served in isolation at a constant rate which is equal to the link rate minus the aggregate average rate of all other sources. Thus, asymptotically, the buffer content of the source is only affected by the traffic characteristics of the other sources through their aggregate average rate. In particular, the source is essentially immune from excessive activity of sources with `heavier'-tailed traffic characteristics. This suggests that GPS-based scheduling algorithms provide an effective mechanism for extracting high multiplexing gains, while protecting individual connections.

Reference-contexts: The queueing analysis of fluid models with multiple long-tailed arrival streams is fundamentally more difficult due to the complex dependency structure in the aggregate arrival process, see for instance Heath et al. [18]. Recently, Agrawal et al. <ref> [2] </ref> obtained interesting partial results. General bounds were derived in Choudhury & Whitt [12]. Boxma [7] and Jelenkovic & Lazar [20] studied the limiting process obtained by multiplexing an infinite number of On-Off sources with regularly-varying and subexponential On-periods, respectively. <p> Thus, asymptotically, the buffer content of source i is only affected by the burst size distribution of the other sources through their aggregate average rate. This is reminiscent of the result obtained in [20] for multiplexing exponential with subexponential processes and the `reduced-load equivalence' established by Agrawal et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. However, the latter result requires bounding conditions on the variability of other sources. Here, such conditions are not needed because of the properties of the GPS discipline. <p> Thus, asymptotically, the buffer content of source i is only influenced by the On-period distribution of the other sources through their aggregate average rate. This is again somewhat similar to Theorem 10 in [20] and a more general result obtained by Agrawal et al. <ref> [2] </ref>. In particular, source i is largely insensitive to extreme activity patterns of other sources with `heavier' On-period distributions. The precise values of the GPS weights are also inessential again, as long as they are larger than the average rates (Assumption 2.1).

Reference-contexts: There are two basic approaches in the analysis of long-tailed traffic phenomena: (i) self-similar processes; and (ii) fluid models with long-tailed arrival processes (e.g. On/Off sources with long-tailed On-periods). Fluid models are closely related to the ordinary single-server queue, thus bringing within reach the classical results on regularly-varying (Cohen <ref> [14] </ref>) or subexponential (Pakes [27], Veraverbeke [31]) behavior of the service and waiting-time distribution in the GI/G/1 queue. Those results are immediately applicable in the case of a single long-tailed arrival stream, see Boxma [6] and Choudhury & Whitt [12]. <p> As mentioned above, the impact of priority mechanisms on long-tailed traffic phenomena has received relatively little attention. Some recent studies have investigated the effect of priorities on the waiting-time distribution in the classical M/G/1 queue. For FCFS, it is well-known <ref> [14] </ref> that the waiting-time tail is regularly varying of index 1 iff the service time tail is regularly varying of index . For Processor Sharing, the waiting-time tail turns out to be regularly varying of the same index as the service time tail [34]. <p> combination N P i B i () (i.e. the arrival process is the superposition of N independent Pois son arrival streams with service time distributions B i ()), then the tail of the workload and waiting-time distribution is determined by the heaviest of the tails of those service time distributions <ref> [14] </ref>. This remains true when the N arrival streams are served according 10 to a non-preemptive priority rule [1, 9]. Under preemptive resume, a particular class is completely oblivious of the presence of lower-priority classes, but is not protected from the influence of `heavier'-tailed characteristics of higher-priority classes.

Reference-contexts: For Processor Sharing, the waiting-time tail turns out to be regularly varying of the same index as the service time tail [34]. In the case of Processor Sharing with several customer classes, Zwart <ref> [33] </ref> recently showed that the sojourn time distribution of a class-i customer is regularly varying of index i iff the service time distribution of that class is regularly varying of index i , regardless of the service time distributions of the other classes.

Reference-contexts: For FCFS, it is well-known [14] that the waiting-time tail is regularly varying of index 1 iff the service time tail is regularly varying of index . For Processor Sharing, the waiting-time tail turns out to be regularly varying of the same index as the service time tail <ref> [34] </ref>.
