Title: A Norm Bound for Projections with Complex Weights  
Author: Elena Y. Bobrovnikova Stephen A. Vavasis 
Date: June 4, 1998  
Abstract: We consider projections weighted by a complex diagonal matrix. These projections arise in the solution of alternating-current electrical networks. A norm bound for weighted projections in the case of an ill-conditioned real positive-definite weight matrix was established by Dikin, Stewart, Todd and others. We show that this bound generalizes to the complex case.

Reference-contexts: The case when D is ill-conditioned is of interest in practice because this case corresponds to a fault in the network, i.e., a near short-circuit or near open-circuit in some transmission line. See Bergen <ref> [1] </ref> for more information about modeling AC networks. In many practical applications, the generators are modeled as fixed power sources rather than fixed voltage sources, in which case the problem of recovering the voltages becomes nonlinear. <p> Nonetheless, there is still a norm bound independent of D as shown by the following theorem. Theorem 2 For any ff 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and any D 2 D , kP ff k n A; where P ff = D ff A (A T DA) 1 A T D 1ff : Proof. First observe that Theorem 1 already establishes the bound in the case ff = 0.

This fact is related to analysis of networks using roots and poles of "transfer functions" as carried out in classic texts on networks <ref> [8] </ref>. But as far as we know, our specific result does not appear previously in the literature because our result involves a supremum not previously considered. Proof. Our proof is based Stewart's proof. First, observe that it suffices to prove (3).
