Abstract: The stability of the Levitron cannot be explained if the top's axis has a fixed direction in space. Stability against flipping is not enough. Gyroscopic precession around the local magnetic field direction is necessary. An analysis and numerical integration of the equations of motion for an experimental stemless top that includes gyroscopic precession around the local magnetic field lines predict that the top will be supported stably up to spin speeds of about 3,065 rpm. An upper spin limit of 2779 rpm for this top is observed experimentally and explained as an adiabatic condition. Spin stabilized magnetic levitation is a macroscopic analog of magnetic gradient traps used to confine particles with a quantum magnetic moment. The Levitron (R) [1] is a remarkable toy which levitates in air a 22 gram spinning permanent magnet in the form of a small handspun top. The top is spun on a lifter plate on a permanent magnet base and then raised to the levitation height. The top floats about 3.2 cm above the base for over 2 minutes until its spin rate declines due to air resistance to about 1000 rpm. Unlike an earlier magnet toy which requires a thrust bearing plate to stabilize motion along one direction[2], the magnetic top floats freely above the base magnet and is fully trapped in 3 dimensions. (see figure 1) Since Earnshaw's theorem of 1842[3] rules out stable magnetic levitation for static magnetic
