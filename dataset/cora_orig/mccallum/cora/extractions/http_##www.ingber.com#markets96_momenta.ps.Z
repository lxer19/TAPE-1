Title: Canonical Momenta Indicators of Financial Markets and Neocortical EEG

Abstract: A paradigm of statistical mechanics of financial markets (SMFM) is fit to multivariate financial markets using Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA), a global optimization algorithm, to perform maximum likelihood fits of Lagrangians defined by path integrals of multivariate conditional probabilities. Canonical momenta are thereby derived and used as technical indicators in a recursive ASA optimization process to tune trading rules. These trading rules are then used on out-of-sample data, to demonstrate that they can profit from the SMFM model, to illustrate that these markets are likely not efficient. This methodology can be extended to other systems, e.g., electroencephalography. This approach to complex systems emphasizes the utility of blending an intuitive and powerful mathematical-physics formalism to generate indicators which are used by AI-type rule-based models of management.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Over a decade ago, the author published a paper suggesting the use of newly developed methods of multivariate nonlinear nonequilibrium calculus to approach a statistical mechanics of financial markets (SMFM) <ref> [1] </ref>. These methods were applied to interest-rate term-structure systems [2,3]. Still, for some time, the standard accepted paradigm of financial markets has been rooted in equilibrium processes [4]. <p> Statistical mechanics of large systems Aggregation problems in nonlinear nonequilibrium systems, e.g., as defines a market composed of many traders <ref> [1] </ref>, typically are solved (accommodated) by having new entities/languages developed at these disparate scales in order to efficiently pass information back and forth [18,19]. This is quite different from the nature of quasi-equilibrium quasi-linear systems, where thermodynamic or cybernetic approaches are possible. These approaches typically fail for nonequilibrium nonlinear systems. <p> Success was gained for large-scale systems in neuroscience, in a series of papers on statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions [20-30], and in nuclear physics [31-33]. This methodology has been used for problems in combat analyses [19,34-37]. These methods have been suggested for financial markets <ref> [1] </ref>, applied to a term structure model of interest rates [2,3], and to optimization of trading [6]. 2.3. Statistical development When other order parameters in addition to price are included to study markets, Eq. (1) is accordingly generalized to a set of Langevin equations.

Data processing For the purposes of this paper, it suffices to consider a two-variable problem, SP500 prices of futures, p 1 cash, p 2 . (Note that in a previous paper <ref> [6] </ref>, these two variables were inadvertently incorrectly reversed.) Data included 251 points of 1989 and 252 points of 1990 daily closing data. Time between data was taken as real time t, e.g., a weekend added two days to the time between data of a Monday and a previous Friday.

Reference-contexts: Section 2 outlines the formalism used to develop the nonlinear nonequilibrium SMFM model. Section 3 describes application of SMFM to SP500 cash and future data, using Adaptive Simulated Annealing (ASA) <ref> [7] </ref> to fit the short-time conditional probabilities developed in Section 2, and to establish trading rules by recursively optimizing with ASA, using optimized technical indicators developed from SMFM.

The cost function for a given system is obtained by the product of P's over all data epochs, i.e., a sum of C 's is obtained.

Reference-contexts: Section 5 is a brief conclusion. 2. SMFM Model 2.1. Random walk model The use of Brownian motion as a model for financial systems is generally attributed to Bachelier <ref> [9] </ref>, though he incorrectly intuited that the noise scaled linearly instead of as the square root relative to the random log-price variable. Einstein is generally credited with using the correct mathematical description in a larger physical context of statistical systems.

Reference-contexts: Customized Momenta Indicators of EEG These techniques are quite generic, and can be applied to a model of statistical mechanics of neocortical interactions (SMNI) which has utilized similar mathematical and numerical algorithms [20-23,25,26,29,30,49]. In this approach, the SMNI model is fit to EEG data, e.g., as previously performed <ref> [25] </ref>. This develops a zeroth order guess for SMNI parameters for a given subject's training data. Next, ASA is used recursively to seek parameterized predictor rules, e.g., modeled according to guidelines used by clinicians.

Reference-contexts: This was good news for people trying to solve hard problems which could not be solved by other algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Minimization of the cost function was performed using ASA. Some experimentation with the fitting process led to a scheme whereby after sufficient importance-sampling, the optimization was shunted over to a quasi-local code, the Canonical momenta indicators of financial markets - 5 - Lester Ingber Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm <ref> [48] </ref>, to add another decimal of precision. If ASA was shunted over too quickly to BFGS, then poor fits were obtained, i.e., the fit stopped in a higher local minimum. Using 1989 data, the parameters f G G were constrained to lie between -1.0 and 1.0.
