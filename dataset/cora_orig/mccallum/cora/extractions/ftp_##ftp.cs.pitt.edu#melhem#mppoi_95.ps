Abstract: We consider the problem of embedding ring and torus communication structures onto the all-optical Partitioned Optical Passive Stars (POPS) topology. We show that the natural embedding, which maps the nodes in the ring or torus directly onto the POPS, does not result in an optimal embedding, and thus does not efficiently utilize the communication capabilities of the POPS. For the ring structure, we present an alternating-pair embedding technique which distributes the communication load uniformly in the POPS. We then apply a slightly modified version of the alternating-pair technique to the embedding of tori onto POPS networks. We prove that both embeddings are optimal, in the sense that they minimize the time required to deliver the messages from each node to its neighbors.

Reference-contexts: Theoret- ically, WDM has remarkable potential, yet substantial progress is needed to achieve acceptable tuning speeds (nanoseconds) over necessary ranges (hundreds of nanometers). More progress is also needed on solutions to power budget problems in large WDM systems. The Partitioned Optical Passive Stars (POPS) topology <ref> [1] </ref> is a topological approach to providing multiple physical data channels. It is an interconnection architecture that uses multiple non-hierarchical stars to achieve single-hop networks [2, 3]. It is an all- optical topology constructed exclusively with passive optical technology.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction. New all-optical networking designs are needed that present multiple data channels which are physically concurrent [6]. Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is one method for achieving these concurrent multiple channels <ref> [4, 9] </ref>. A large amount of research has been accomplished on WDM-based systems. The majority of this has been to develop multiple-access multiple-channel protocols on star architectures using tunable transmitters and receivers [7].

Reference-contexts: The number of such channels is not absolutely limited, and is a key engineering tradeoff. This design flexibility provides for a customized optimization between lower total system complexity versus the combination of higher system throughput with both lower power budgets and lower network control overheads. An analysis in <ref> [5] </ref> confirms that, independent of the number of channels configured, POPS network data channels can be efficiently utilized for random permutation-based communication patterns. Beyond random communication patterns, multiprocessor applications frequently exhibit regular communication patterns. Topologies that are appropriate for interconnection networks must efficiently accommodate these communication structures. <p> In <ref> [5] </ref>, POPS networks delivering random message sets that are permutations or subsets of permutations were shown to be highly efficient. The following sections of this paper examine some regular communication structures, specifically the ring and two dimensional torus structures.
