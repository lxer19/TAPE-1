Abstract: This paper describes a novel approach to find a tighter bound of the transformation of the Min-Max problems into the one of Least-Square Estimation. It is well known that the above transformation of one problem to the other can lead to the proof that their target functions linearly bound each other. However, this linear bound is not a tight one. In this paper, we prove that if we transform the Min-Max problem into two Least-Square Estimation problems, where one minimizes the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) of the original function and the other one minimizes the RMS of the difference between the original function and an arbitrary constant, one can obtain a tighter bound between their target functions. The tighter bound given by this novel approach depends on the outcome of the second Least-Square Estimation problem, so there is a great incentive to choose the arbitrary constant which gives the smallest RMS of the second Least-Square Estimation problem. For a problem with a large number of variables, this novel tighter bound can be two to three order tighter than the old one.

Reference-contexts: tightest linear bound possible which makes the translation of the solution in the case of the multiple observable output variable exactly the same as that of the case of the single observable output variable. 4 Implementation and Practical Consideration The Levenberg-Marquardt method is used to solve the Least-Square Estimation problem <ref> [2] </ref>. Theorems 1, 2, and 3 show the consistency between the minimization of the original problem and the minimization of the transformed Least-Square Estimation problem. <p> j)th element J T (i; j) = J (j; i), fl is a diagonal matrix in which the values of its diagonal elements are the same as the diagonal elements of J T J, and is the Lagrange Multiplier properly selected to speed up the convergence of the optimization process <ref> [2] </ref>.

The old optimization method presented by Wang et al. <ref> [3] </ref> does improve the performance of this clock tree by reducing the maximum path delay and skew through minimizing the delays and the damping ratio errors. Although the skew has been reduced to 96pS, there is still room for improvement.

Reference-contexts: The optimal design is better than both the old optimal design and the uniform width design because its maximum path delay is the smallest among the three designs.
