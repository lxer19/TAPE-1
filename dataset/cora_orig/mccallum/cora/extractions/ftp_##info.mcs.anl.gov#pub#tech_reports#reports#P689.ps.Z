Abstract: We present an approach for determining the vibrational eigenstates of four-atom molecules. The primary representation of the (six-dimensional) eigenstates involves a finite basis or quantum number representation, whereas Hamiltonian matrix-vector products are evaluated with the aid of certain grid or discrete variable representations. This approach leads to computational and memory demands that are within acceptable limits. The implicitly restarted Lanczos method, as implemented in the ARPACK suites of codes, is then applied to determine some of the corresponding vibrational eigenstates. A distributed-memory parallel implementation of the method allows very large symmetric matrix eigenvalue problems|on the order of N = 2 10 6 |to be tackled. The lowest fifty vibrational states of the HOCO molecule, with zero total angular momentum and even parity, are accurately computed on Argonne National Laboratory's IBM SP computer.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the determination of all the eigenvalues when N 10 6 is currently not feasible, nor is it desirable because only the lower energetic portion of the spectrum, or perhaps some particular spectral range, is typically of physical interest. Iterative methods such as the Lanczos method <ref> [3] </ref> can instead be used to determine some of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Since the Lanczos method requires matrix-vector products with H, our representation must be such that an application of H to a vector is computationally efficient. <p> In particular, we retain, in part, the idea of using DVRs or grid representations, but explore how a Lanczos method applied within a parallel computing environment may be used. We employ an implicitly restarted Lanczos method (IRLM) as implemented in the parallel implmentation <ref> [3] </ref> of the ARPACK [3] software package. The use of an implicitly restarted algorithm yields the corresponding eigenvectors directly. Such an approach can be more demanding in terms of computer memory than the straightforward Lanczos method. <p> In particular, we retain, in part, the idea of using DVRs or grid representations, but explore how a Lanczos method applied within a parallel computing environment may be used.

The use of an implicitly restarted algorithm yields the corresponding eigenvectors directly. Such an approach can be more demanding in terms of computer memory than the straightforward Lanczos method. <p> As the total number of angular functions, N A , becomes large, e.g., on the order of 1000 or more, the number of matrix elements can exceed typical computer memory limitations. Of course, if one adopts an STD approach <ref> [3] </ref>, this situation can be improved.) Thus in the grid representation, the actual wavefunction is formally approxi 6 mated as = i;j;k;a;b;c where f i , f j , f k , and g a;b;c involve the underlying basis function representations and transformation functions. <p> The user-specified tolerance and machine precision are denoted by * U and * M , respectively. The first condition is that of accuracy, the second that of (numerical) orthogonality. It is well known <ref> [3, pp. 479-485] </ref> that roundoff errors cause the Lanczos vectors to lose orthogonality. <p> The user-specified tolerance and machine precision are denoted by * U and * M , respectively. The first condition is that of accuracy, the second that of (numerical) orthogonality. It is well known [3, pp. 479-485] that roundoff errors cause the Lanczos vectors to lose orthogonality. However, Paige <ref> [3] </ref> showed that the loss of orthogonality occurs precisely when an eigenvalue of T j is close to one of H: In fact, the Lanczos vectors lose orthogonality in the direction of the associated approximate eigenvector. <p> Sorensen <ref> [3] </ref> derived an elegant scheme for applying any polynomial filter of degree p ( m) without direct application of H: Moreover, a length mp Lanc-zos reduction remains. We illustrate the scheme for a degree one polynomial. <p> (H I)Q m = Q m UR + fi m q m+1 e T A simple derivation gives T m U = U (RU + I) = UT + where T + m is an updated symmetric tridiagonal matrix. (Note that (14) is one step of the shifted QR algorithm <ref> [3, pp. 144-145] </ref>.) Next, postmultiplying the original length m Lanczos reduction with U results in HQ m U = Q m T m U + fi m q m+1 e T m + fi m q m+1 e T where we used (14). <p> Note that if = 0, then a step of subspace iteration has been implicitly applied; this is analogous to the connection between the QR algorithm and subspace iteration. See <ref> [3] </ref> for further details. <p> The last point is important because it allows the possibility of constructing general-purpose and reliable software for the large-scale eigenvalue problem. The reader is referred to <ref> [3] </ref> for further details. 3.2 Parallel Strategy Suppose we have a length j 1 Lanczos reduction HQ j1 = Q j1 T j1 + fi j1 q j e T j1 and want to increase the length by one. <p> Note that g is the jth column of T j ; fi j1 and ff j are the last two elements of g, and the leading j 2 elements are equal to zero. The parallel implementation <ref> [3] </ref> of IRLM in ARPACK uses a data-parallel model of computation. So that large eigenvalue problems can be solved, the rows of the Lanczos matrix Q j are distributed (w and f are also conformably distributed) among the available processors. <p> Furthermore, the presence of three relatively heavy atoms makes quantum mechanical studies of this system difficult, owing to the underlying small de Broglie wavelengths involved. A reasonable potential energy surface based on ab initio electronic structure data is readily 13 available [3,3]. (A newer surface <ref> [3] </ref> has been devised that improves some of the older surface's energetics. <p> However, given the configuration of the IBM SP, at most 60 processors were available.) ARPACK uses the MPICH <ref> [3] </ref> implementation of MPI [3] for communication among the processors. Table 1 presents our best results for the lowest 52 energy levels (J=0, even parity) of HOCO with the assumed potential function in [3,3]. We emphasize that this study represents the first accurate determination of the vibrational eigenstates of HOCO. <p> However, given the configuration of the IBM SP, at most 60 processors were available.)

Some estimates of the first twenty vibrational energy levels have been published <ref> [3] </ref>. However, these were based on a 5D model that included only CO zero-point energy effects, and these levels, particularly beyond the first few levels, are not very accurate.

For example, the approach outlined here could be applied with a shift-and-invert transformation or Green function techniques <ref> [3] </ref>. Filter-diagonalization methods [3,3] also appear to be interesting alternative approaches to the problem. 18 Acknowledgements RBL was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, Contracts DE-FG0f-91ER25103 and W-31-109-Eng-38.
