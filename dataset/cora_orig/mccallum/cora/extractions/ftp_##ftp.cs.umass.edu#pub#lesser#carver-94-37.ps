Title: A First Step Toward the Formal Analysis of Solution Quality in Distributed Interpretation Systems  
Author: Norman Carver and Victor Lesser 
Abstract: CMPSCI Technical Report 94-37 May 1994 Abstract In the functionally-accurate, cooperative (FA/C) distributed problem-solving paradigm, agents produce tentative, partial results based on local information only, and then exploit the constraints among these local results to resolve uncertainties and global inconsistencies. However, there has never been any formal analysis of the quality of the solutions that are produced by the approach or of the conditions that are necessary for the approach to be successful. This paper represents a first step in formally analyzing the quality of solutions that can be produced by FA/C systems, within the context of distributed interpretation. Two theorems that compare the quality of solutions produced by a distributed system to those produced by an equivalent centralized system are presented. The theorems relate solution quality to agent problem-solving and coordination strategies. The analysis is based on an abstract model of the DRESUN system for distributed sensor interpretation. While the paper concentrates on sensor interpretation, we expect to extend the work to apply to FA/C systems in general. fl This paper will appear in the Proceedings of the 13th International Workshop on Distributed Artificial Intelligence, July, 1994.

Reference-contexts: Our model of the interpretation process will be essentially that used in <ref> [1] </ref>: interpretation hypotheses are incrementally constructed via abductive inferences, based on a causal model that defines the relationships among the data types and abstraction types. <p> For example, it is the acceptance threshold, along with other factors like the phenomena of interest, that are specified by the termination criteria|the conditions that must be met for termination of problem solving. The RESUN/DRESUN architecture provides great flexibility for implementing interpretation strategies <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. 4 3 The DRESUN Model In an FA/C system, there must be some mechanism to drive interactions among the agents so that incorrect and inconsistent local solutions can be detected and dealt with. <p> Ideally, this would be accomplished with a mechanism that allowed agents to understand where there are constraints among their subproblems, so that information interchange could be highly directed. DRESUN <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref> provides this capability, and it will form the basis for our model of the capabilities of an FA/C agent. <p> This issue arises because interpretation problems are not propositional, so as additional evidence is generated for a hypothesis the evidence both modifies the hypothesis' belief and refines the values of its attributes|creating new versions of the hypothesis (what <ref> [1] </ref> terms extensions). Thus, what we really mean is that a precursor, partial version of each alternative hypothesis would have been created by one or more of the agents.

Reference-contexts: The paper is also limited to the issue of solution quality at termination; we are pursuing both empirical and analytic approaches to address other issues in FA/C problem solving. 1 This work is different from most DAI work dealing with global consistency of agent beliefs (e.g., <ref> [4, 5] </ref>), which has focused on methods for automatically maintaining (some level of) consistency. Here, we are interested in analyzing the consequences of not maintaining consistency (even within individual agents) in terms of its effect on solution quality.

Reference-contexts: A solution to an interpretation problem is an explanation of what caused the available data. In general, this will be a composite interpretation, composed of a set of hypotheses whose types are from a specified subset of the interpretation types (the explanation corpus <ref> [9] </ref>), each of which explains some subset of the data. In a centralized interpretation system, all of the data is available to the 2 single agent. <p> In this paper we are interested in analyzing the quality of the global solutions that can be produced by FA/C distributed interpretation systems. We will analyze solution quality relative to what we term the "globally best solution." Ideally, this should be the most probable explanation (MPE) <ref> [9] </ref> given all of the available data. 2 The problem with defining the globally best solution to be the global MPE is that for many interpretation problems it is impractical to compute the MPE. <p> The complexity of computing the MPE can be understood by considering the differences between interpretation problems and the kinds of problems that are typically studied in research on abductive inference and probabilistic network inference (e.g., <ref> [9, 10] </ref>). For simplicity, we will refer to these problems as diagnosis problems. The key difference is that these problems are propositional while interpretation is not, in general. In other words, diagnosis problems have a fixed set of causes and possible findings, with fixed relations among them.
