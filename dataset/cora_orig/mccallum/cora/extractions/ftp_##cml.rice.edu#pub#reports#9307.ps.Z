Title: A Wavelet Approach to Robust Multilevel Solvers for Anisotropic Elliptic Problems  
Author: Andreas Rieder fl Raymond O. Wells, Jr. Xiaodong Zhou 
Keyword: Key words: wavelets, wavelet packets, robust multilevel methods, anisotropic problems, Galerkin techniques  
Note: The wavelet version of the FDMGM presented here involves wavelet packets which have been used before this primarily in signal processing.  Subject classification: AMS(MOS) 65F10, 65N30 1 partially supported by AFOSR under grant 90-0334 which was funded by DARPA partially supported by a Feodor Lynen-Fellowship of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation  
Date: March 9, 1994  
Abstract: The perfect reconstruction property and the multiresolution structure of wavelets yield the robustness of the additive as well as of the multiplicative version of a two-level method corresponding to any intermediate level in the FDMGM. Aspects of the robustness of the multilevel scheme are discussed. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results.

Reference-contexts: Following the philosophy of multigrid methods <ref> [9] </ref>, [25], we first apply a classicial relaxation process (Richardson, Jacobi or Gau-Seidel) as BIM times with initial guess U 0 l : We obtain an approximate solution U - l : In general, the BIM only reduces error components well in the direction of eigenvectors corresponding to large eigenvalues. <p> I L 1 l A l of the BIM: 1=2 l k A l C s (-)ffi 1 where the constant C s and the function depend neither on ffi l nor on *: Further, kS - The assumption (4.3) is usually called the smoothing property of the BIM, see <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> the point-wise versions of the Richardson (L l = fi 1 I) and the damped Jacobi it eration (L l = fi 1 diag (A l )) satisfy (4.3) as well as (4.4) with (-) = p 0 (2-); 0 (-) = - =(- + 1) -+1 ; see e.g. <ref> [9] </ref>, Chapter 6.2. One step of the robust wavelet-based method (or frequency decomposition method in the notation of [10]) is as follows: after steps of the BIM, perform one coarse grid correction step (4.1). <p> The matrices M l; (-) are defined in (5.4). If the BIM S l; satisfies (4.4), then kM 0 + kM 0 fl l1;1 (-)k A l1;1 : Proof: The recursion (5.13) follows by transfering the proof of Lemma 7.1.4 in <ref> [9] </ref> to the additive coarse grid correction. <p> For an analysis of the damped V -cycle we refer to [21]. For the W -cycle the standard techniques, see <ref> [9] </ref>, Chapter 7, may be succesful. The idea is to analyze the sequence ~ l; l = l + ~ 2 l1; l 1 (5.15) with 1 l L, 0 l 2 Ll 1 ( l binary), ~ 0; = 0 and = C b (-) + p . <p> The connection of (5.15) with (5.14) is obvious. Since &gt; p , the 's can not be made arbitrarily small by just increasing -. Therefore, the convergence of the W -cycle does not follow directly from the two-level convergence as in <ref> [9] </ref>. However, if the apparent decrease of the 's (5.6), see Table 1, could be verified analytically, then the above approach would yield the robustness of the W -cycle.

Reference-contexts: Following the philosophy of multigrid methods [9], <ref> [25] </ref>, we first apply a classicial relaxation process (Richardson, Jacobi or Gau-Seidel) as BIM times with initial guess U 0 l : We obtain an approximate solution U - l : In general, the BIM only reduces error components well in the direction of eigenvectors corresponding to large eigenvalues.

Reference-contexts: These two ways correspond to the two complementary iterations, the coarse grid correction and the basic iterative method (BIM), which are the main ingredients of a multigrid process. One way is to choose a sophisticated BIM as done, for instance, in [22] and <ref> [26] </ref>. However, the performance of the BIM used in these cases (incomplete 2 LU decomposition [26], block versions of the Gau-Seidel relaxation [22]) is limited, see Chapter 10 in [10], especially for 3D applications. <p> One way is to choose a sophisticated BIM as done, for instance, in [22] and <ref> [26] </ref>.

The convergence rate behaves like that one of the V -cycle of the usual multigrid method (based on Finite Element or Finite Difference discretization) with ILU as BIM, see <ref> [26] </ref>. In the latter case robustness had been achieved by damping the ILU method.

Reference-contexts: We do not view this wavelet variation of the FDMGM in the more general setting of additive Schwarz iterations (see [11]), in which the BIM is replaced by subspace corrections (see <ref> [27] </ref>, [28]) which reduce high frequency error components.

Consequently, we approximate the error E - l in both spaces V p p p p l1 instead of only in V p p as in a standard multigrid procedure.
