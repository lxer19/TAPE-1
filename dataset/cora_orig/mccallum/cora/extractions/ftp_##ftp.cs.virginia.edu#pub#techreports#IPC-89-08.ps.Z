Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION The goal of the ADAMS (Advanced DAta Management System) project <ref> [1] </ref> is to create a database system that allows processes written in traditional programming languages to simultaneously access persistent data. This report describes a storage manager that can be utilized by ADAMS to support such access, while relieving the applications programmer of the low-level details.
