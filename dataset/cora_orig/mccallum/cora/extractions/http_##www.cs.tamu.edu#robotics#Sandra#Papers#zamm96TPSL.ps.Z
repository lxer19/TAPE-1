Abstract: This paper is a summary of a comprehensive study of the problem of predicting the accelerations of a set of rigid, three-dimensional bodies in contact in the presence of Coulomb friction. We begin with a brief introduction of this problem and its governing equations. This is followed by the introduction of complementarity formulations for the contact problem under two friction laws: Coulomb's Law of quadratic friction and an approximated pyramid law. Existence and uniqueness results for the complementarity problems are presented. Algorithms for solving these problems are proposed and their convergence properties are discussed. Computational results are presented and conclusions are drawn.

Reference-contexts: The VR community is motivated by the desire to enhance the believability of the scenes in which the VR user is submersed. Currently, systems cannot handle situations involving the loss of contact and multiple contacts between objects [17], but progress is being made toward this goal by Baraff <ref> [1] </ref>, who has followed Lotstedt's lead in the application of complementarity theory and pivoting methods [15]. The robotics and graphics communities are interested in the inverse problem. Specifically, roboticists and animators want to discover input trajectories that accomplish a task or action described at a very high level [14, 16].

Reference-contexts: The condition (36) is trivially satisfied when the columns of the system Jacobian matrix are linearly independent, since then its null space becomes the origin. Thus, our existence condition (when specialized to the planar case) is less restrictive than previous results obtained by Lotstedt [15] and Baraff <ref> [2] </ref>. As noted in [19], when the constant vector, b, defined in equation (23), lies in the column space of J T , then (36) must hold and the existence of a solution follows (assuming S = ;).

Reference-contexts: formulations in the previous paper and assuming small friction coefficients and full row rank of the "system Jacobian matrix," we establish herein existence and uniqueness results for the contact problem allowing initial sliding and rolling; we show that for a friction pyramid model and under the same assumptions, Lemke's algorithm <ref> [5, Algorithm 4.4.5] </ref> will always compute a solution of the multi-rigid-body contact model; we also describe a feasible interior-point method [12] for solving the same model. <p> A comprehensive study of the latter problem is contained in the book <ref> [5] </ref>. In what follows, we show that the contact problem with Coulomb friction can be formulated as a mixed NCP, whereas that with pyramid friction can be formulated as an LCP. <p> This implies that the principal submatrix 2 4 ( ~ A nn ) RS (A nn ) RR 5 is P. By LCP results <ref> [5] </ref>, it follows that for each fixed but arbitrary pair (c Rt ; c Ro ), there exists a 12 unique pair (a n ; c n ) satisfying " a Rn = 4 ( ~ A nn ) RS (A nn ) RR 5 c Sn # " (A nt <p> A simple proof of Proposition 1 can be found in [23]. 5 Solution Methods for Friction Pyramid Model The formulation of the friction pyramid model as the LCP defined by (32)-(35) permits the numerical solution of this model by a host of algorithms as described in <ref> [5] </ref>. The main concern with the application of these algorithms is whether their convergence criteria are satisfied by the data of this particular LCP. In our study, we have focused on two algorithms: one classical and the other contemporary. <p> In our study, we have focused on two algorithms: one classical and the other contemporary. The former is Lemke's almost complementarity pivot algorithm; the latter is a feasible interior point algorithm. We refer the reader to <ref> [5] </ref> for a comprehensive treatment of Lemke's algorithm and its convergence theory. The following is the main convergence result of this algorithm applied to the LCP in question. Theorem 2 Suppose that the system Jacobian matrix J has full column rank. <p> Moreover the constant vector r in the equation (32) satisfies the following implication: x 0 x T M x = 0 &gt; &gt; = ) r T x 0: The desired conclusion now follows from a known LCP result <ref> [5, Theorem 4.4.13] </ref>. Q.E.D. The family of interior point methods is a recent entry into the field of the LCP. Fueled by their great success for solving linear programs, these methods have received much attention in the mathematical programming literature.

Reference-contexts: The contact conditions stipulate complementary relations between the normal forces and accelerations, while the maximum work principle implies that the tangential forces oppose the tangential accelerations. A common approach to solving the multi-rigid-body contact problem, as seen in the DADS package developed by Haug <ref> [7] </ref>, has been based on a formulation of the problem as a system of differential algebraic equations (DAEs). In such an approach, the contact interactions (e.g. rolling, sliding, and breaking) are assumed known, so that all unilateral constraints can be replaced by bilateral constraints.

Reference-contexts: This makes choosing the "correct" set of kinematic constraints impossible in some situations. The present paper reports analytical and computational results obtained in our study of the three-dimensional multi-rigid-body contact problem subject to quadratic Coulomb friction laws and their variations. This paper is a continuation of the previous one <ref> [19] </ref> in which various complementarity formulations were given for this contact problem and a main existence result was established under the assumption that all contacts are initially rolling. <p> Thus, our existence condition (when specialized to the planar case) is less restrictive than previous results obtained by Lotstedt [15] and Baraff [2]. As noted in <ref> [19] </ref>, when the constant vector, b, defined in equation (23), lies in the column space of J T , then (36) must hold and the existence of a solution follows (assuming S = ;). <p> By an elementary linear algebraic argument, it is therefore possible to derive an estimate for the largest upper bound for ; however, such an estimate is typically very conservative and can be expected to be much smaller than one would expect to encounter in real systems; see <ref> [19, Appendix I] </ref> for the derivation of such an estimate. We note one important difference between the assumptions in (b) and (c). Namely, in (b) only those friction coefficients at the sliding contacts are assumed small; whereas in (c), all friction coefficients are assumed small.
