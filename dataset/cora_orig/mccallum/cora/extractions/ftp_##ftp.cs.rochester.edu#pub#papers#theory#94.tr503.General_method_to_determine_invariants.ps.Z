Reference-contexts: In particular, much attention has been paid to the identification of complete series of invariants in order to describe an object by its invariants (with respect to a given trans formation) in a one-to-one manner.

Some of the Fourier descriptors obtained in this section have the same form as those of Arbter et al. <ref> [Ar90] </ref>. In Section 3.4, we give some new invariants obtained from the Legendre coefficients and the two-dimensional Fourier coefficients, respectively. Finally, projective invariants of an ordered set of points, which are similar to the well-known 5-points invariants, are calculated in Section 3.5. <p> This is different from the work of Arbter et al. and Burkhardt <ref> [Ar90, Bu79] </ref> who consider the case of curves.
