Title: Working Within the FGCS National Project  
Author: E. Tick

Date: October 1992  March 1993.  
Abstract: The Japanese Fifth Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) extending from 1982-1992 has been enshrouded in hype since its inception. The national project made bold promises in the fields of artifical intelligence and computer engineering, and these goals were amplified by the media and overseas researchers. Now that the dust is settling, it is time to take a good long look at the project, its accomplishments, and failures. This essay is a personal account of my experiences working within, and around, the FGCS project at the Institute for New Generation Computer Technology (ICOT) and elsewhere. I focus on the development of hard and soft technologies, as well as human infrastructure. "It is not very often that Westerners get to see the Japanese just as they are. The difficulty we have when we look at Japan | the layers-of-the-onion problem | can be so frustrating that we tend to raise our own screen of assumptions and expectations, or we content ourselves with images of the Japanese as they would like to be seen. If you live in Japan, you learn to value moments of clarity | times when you feel as if you'd walked into a room where someone is talking to himself and doesn't know you're there." Letter from Japan P. Smith [70]

Reference-contexts: In 1988, the groups were struggling to complete the Multi-PSI-V2 demonstration. Yet the design of the PIM machines were largely underway, and little if any Multi-PSI experience collected after 1988 affected PIM. Still, the sophistication of PIM instrumentation and experimentation (e.g., Toshiba's PIM/k cache monitors and Fujitsu's ParaGraph <ref> [1] </ref>) have improved over the final period, even if the newer application benchmarks [62] have not yet been exercised on the PIMs. One impediment to my research was lack of compiler technology.
