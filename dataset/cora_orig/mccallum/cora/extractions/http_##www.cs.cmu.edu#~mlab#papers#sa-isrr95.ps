Title: Planar Manipulation on a Conveyor with a One Joint Robot  
Author: Srinivas Akella Wesley H. Huang Kevin M. Lynch Matthew T. Mason 
Affiliation: The Robotics Institute Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: This paper explores a method of manipulating a planar rigid body on a conveyor belt using a robot with just one joint. This approach has the potential of offering a simple and flexible method for feeding parts in industrial automation applications. In this paper we outline our approach, develop some of the theoretical properties, present a planner for the robot, and describe an initial implementation.

Reference-contexts: Many researchers have studied constraint surfaces with simple shapes to handle a variety of parts. Examples of this include orienting parts by fences suspended over a conveyor (Peshkin and Sanderson [29]; Brokowski et al. [12]); translational pushing by a fence (Mani and Wilson [26]; Akella and Mason <ref> [1] </ref>); parallel-jaw grasping (Goldberg [20]); tray-tilting (Erdmann and Mason [18]; Christiansen [15]); vibrating a supporting plate (Bohringer et al. [6]; Swanson et al. [33]); and pushing by arrays of electromechanical manipulators (Bohringer et al. [7]). Underactuated Systems The 1JOC is an underac-tuated system with a drift field.

Reference-contexts: Other examples of manipulation by an underac-tuated effector include slipping and rolling within a grasp (Bicchi and Sorrentino [5]; Brock [10]; Rao et al. [30]) and dynamic tasks such as snatching, rolling, and throwing (Arai and Khatib <ref> [3] </ref>; Lynch and Mason [25]). The 1JOC can be likened to an underactuated manipulator in a gravity field, where the proximal shoul der (fence pivot) is directly actuated, but the distal degrees of freedom (represented by the object) are not.

Reference-contexts: Our problem as stated above is a nonlinear programming problem whose feasible solutions yield valid feeding plans. (See Bazaraa and Shetty's text <ref> [4] </ref> for an introduction to nonlinear programming.) Once we have a solution for the g i , q i , q + i , and r i values which satisfies the constraints (5)-(16) and minimizes our objective function, we must still determine a series of jogs to execute the translations g

(For an introduction to motion planning for cars, and nonholonomic motion planning in general, see Latombe's text <ref> [22] </ref>.) Each setting of the steering wheel defines a rotation center of the car. In the case of the car these two rotation centers move with the car.

Reference-contexts: For the start and goal configurations, we generate candidate edge transition sequences. For each such sequence, the corresponding objective function and constraints are input to a commercial nonlinear programming package called GINO <ref> [23] </ref> to solve the problem. A feasible solution to the nonlinear programming formulation provides us with a valid feeding plan. See the example plans in Figure 11. Currently we use minimum stable radius values empirically determined to be robust.

Reference-contexts: If either or both is unidirectional, the system is not small-time locally controllable, but it can be shown to be controllable by a simple constructive argument (Brockett [11]; Lynch and Mason <ref> [24] </ref>). The 1JOC system consisting of a conveyor and a rotating fence resembles the system above with a unidirectional conveyor. <p> When the part is at rest, the fence is executing a stable push. The pushing direction, as seen by the part, is opposite the conveyor's velocity direction. Of course, a stable push may also occur while the fence is rotating. In a previous paper (Lynch and Mason <ref> [24] </ref>), we described the procedure STABLE that finds a set of stable pushing directions V stable for a given pushing edge, pushing friction coefficient, and center of mass of the part. This set of pushing directions is fixed in the part frame F p . <p> For simplicity, we will only consider the edges of the part that yield a stable push while the fence is held at 0 degrees (the pushing direction is a translation normal to the edge). The existence of these stable edges is indicated by the following lemma (Lynch and Mason <ref> [24] </ref>): Lemma 1 All polygonal parts have at least one edge such that the normal translational pushing direction, along with a neighborhood of this pushing direction, belongs to V stable . Such edges are called stable edges.
