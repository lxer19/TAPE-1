Abstract: The SUPRENUM project was a major effort in Germany to develop a national expertise in massively parallel processing both at the hardware and software level. We review the development of SUPRENUM and introduce the twelve later papers in this proceedings that deal in more detail with SUPRENUM. Taken together these papers present an overview of the project goals, its historical development, successes and failures of the project, and indicate ways in which the project has influenced MPP developments elsewhere. GENESIS was a European ESPRIT project focused on massively parallel processing. It included both hardware and software architecture aspects. GENESIS was a natural development from SUPRENUM and used the Suprenum-1 machine as its primary hardware platform. We briefly discuss GENESIS and introduce the nine papers in this volume that represent the GENESIS effort. GENESIS has had a significant effect on many other MPP efforts. Several of the papers address these influences in some detail.

Reference-contexts: Today no one doubts that German researchers are among those at the forefront of MPP research world wide. - 3 - 2.2. SUPRENUM Papers The SUPRENUM papers naturally fall into four groups. First are three papers [1-3], by two of the key principal investigators, U. Trottenberg <ref> [1] </ref> and W. Giloi [2], and by an outside independent researcher, O. McBryan [3], which analyze the successes and failures of the project. The second [4] and third [5-7] groups of papers deal respectively with MPP architectures and software. <p> SUPRENUM Perspective Dr. U. Trottenberg was involved with SUPRENUM from its inception, and headed the SUPRENUM GmbH company as its Scientific Director. In his insightful paper <ref> [1] </ref> "Some remarks on the SUPRENUM project" he reviews the origins of SUPRENUM, its organization and its major successes. Dr. Trottenberg also addresses some of the controversies that surrounded SUPRENUM, and discusses lessons to be learned from SUPRENUM for application to future projects. Dr. W.K.

Giloi was also involved in SUPRENUM from near the start and was the principal architect of the Suprenum-1 prototype. Dr. Giloi discusses the design issues involved in the Suprenum-1 hardware and operating system in the paper <ref> [2] </ref> "The SUPRENUM Supercomputer: Goals, Achievements, and Lessons Learned". This paper provides the essential technical basis for understanding the remaining papers in the volume.

The second [4] and third [5-7] groups of papers deal respectively with MPP architectures and software. <p> This paper provides the essential technical basis for understanding the remaining papers in the volume. We have been familiar with the SUPRENUM project since its inception, and at the same time we were involved directly with several MPP projects in the USA. Our paper <ref> [3] </ref> "SUPRENUM: Perspectives and Performance" summarizes our views of the project and analyzes the reasons behind some of the difficulties experienced. This paper also presents performance measurements of Suprenum-1 that in fact might well be part of the fourth set of papers, on applications and benchmarks. 2.2.2. <p> Schwamborn and M. Tazza, discusses the problem of understanding Suprenum-1 performance measurements through detailed performance modeling. The paper shows that for an important class of grid algorithms, performance can be predicted accurately provided sufficiently detailed parameterizations of the architecture are used. The later sections of our previously mentioned paper <ref> [3] </ref> " S U P R E N U M : Perspectives and Performance" presents results of a series of Suprenum-1 benchmarks we developed for the well-known Shallow Water Equations, frequently used in the atmospheric and oceanographic modeling communities.

Giloi [2], and by an outside independent researcher, O. McBryan [3], which analyze the successes and failures of the project. The second <ref> [4] </ref> and third [5-7] groups of papers deal respectively with MPP architectures and software. The fourth, and by far largest, group of papers [8-12] are those dealing with benchmarking, performance evaluation and applications on SUPRENUM and related systems. 2.2.1. SUPRENUM Perspective Dr. U. <p> This paper also presents performance measurements of Suprenum-1 that in fact might well be part of the fourth set of papers, on applications and benchmarks. 2.2.2. Computer Architectures The SUPRENUM project has been critical in the development of several more recent MPP software and architecture projects. In the paper <ref> [4] </ref> "Parallel Supercomputer Architectures and Their Programming Models", Dr. W.K. Giloi discusses some of these recent developments and relates them to the SUPRENUM roots. 2.2.3. MPP Software and OS The PEACE operating system was designed within the SUPRENUM project to provide an efficient scalable massively parallel OS. <p> Many difficult design decisions were involved, particularly those related to minimizing the OS overheads for message passing subroutine calls. PEACE has continued to evolve beyond the SUPRENUM project, and is the OS for the Manna architecture discussed in the - 4 - previous paper <ref> [4] </ref> by W. Giloi. Dr. W. Schrder-Preikschat reviews all of these topics in his paper [5] "PEACE - A Software Backplane for Parallel Computing". SUPRENUM was the first MIMD supercomputer to support Fortran 90 array extensions in each node.

Reference-contexts: PEACE has continued to evolve beyond the SUPRENUM project, and is the OS for the Manna architecture discussed in the - 4 - previous paper [4] by W. Giloi. Dr. W. Schrder-Preikschat reviews all of these topics in his paper <ref> [5] </ref> "PEACE - A Software Backplane for Parallel Computing". SUPRENUM was the first MIMD supercomputer to support Fortran 90 array extensions in each node. The SUPRENUM architecture, with its complex vector nodes, posed a serious challenge for compiler development. However there was no body of preexisting Fortran 90 programs.

Reference-contexts: For this reason it is difficult to strictly separate papers into GENESIS or SUPRENUM categories. This has been done here primarily to indicate the nature of the efforts, but at least one paper <ref> [6] </ref> clearly represents work equally attributable to both projects. Section 2 introduces the SUPRENUM project and then briefly discusses each of the SUPRENUM papers in this volume. <p> However there was no body of preexisting Fortran 90 programs. The SUPERB project developed an automatic parallelization facility capable of generating fully parallel SUPRENUM Fortran (including message passing insertions) from an initial F77 application program. H.P. Zima, P. Brezany and B.M. Chapman describe SUPERB in their paper <ref> [6] </ref> "SUPERB and Vienna Fortran". Vienna Fortran is a related project developed under the GENESIS project. SUPRENUM supported a comprehensive array of facilities for providing user access to parallelism. <p> Vienna Fortran has had a significant impact on the design of the HPF MPP language designed by the High Performance Computing Forum. A number of GENESIS partners were members of the HPF Forum. H.P. Zima, P. Brezany and B.M. Chapman describe the language in the paper <ref> [6] </ref> "SUPERB and Vienna Fortran". Because SUPERB was developed within the earlier SUPRENUM project, and Vienna Fortran was a natural outgrowth of SUPERB, this paper appears in the SUPRENUM section of the volume. A major goal of GENESIS was to develop portability strategies for MPP applications.

Reference-contexts: At an intermediate level, PARMACS provided a portable message passing environment for SUPRENUM. At the highest level, an applications library of grid operations called COMLIB provided a powerful facility for scientific computing applications. R. Hempel reviews each of these areas in his paper <ref> [7] </ref>: "Applications Programming Interfaces for SUPRENUM". 2.2.4. Benchmarking and Applications The remaining SUPRENUM papers all deal with benchmarking, performance evaluation and applications on SUPRENUM.

Reference-contexts: Most of the measurements described in these papers relate to grid oriented computations, an area where SUPRENUM software provided particularly strong support. The paper <ref> [8] </ref> "Performance Modeling of Grid Problems - A Case Study on the SUPRENUM System", by H. Mierendorff, H. Schwamborn and M.

Reference-contexts: Alef describes the implementation of a multigrid algorithm on the Suprenum-1 and reports the measured performance. - 5 - In contrast with the previous papers which by and large report results specific to SUPRENUM, the paper <ref> [10] </ref> "LiSS - An environment for the parallel multigrid solution of partial differential equations on general 2D domains", by H. Ritzdorf, A. Schller, B. Steckel and K. Stben, describes a very general package developed in the SUPRENUM project for the solution of nonlinear PDE on MPP machines.

Reference-contexts: The package utilizes the portable PARMACS communication library (also developed within SUPRENUM) and as a result LiSS runs on most MPP systems. O. Ptzold, A. Schller and H. Schwichtenberg present quite diverse measurements of Suprenum-1 performance in their paper <ref> [11] </ref> "Parallel Applications and Performance Measurements on SUPRENUM". In contrast to the previous papers that discussed only grid applications, this paper includes also measurements for two other types of algorithm: Monte Carlo methods in statistical mechanics, and chemical transport computations.

Reference-contexts: Architecture Design A major goal of GENESIS was to develop a second generation European supercomputer design that would build on the lessons already learned in SUPRENUM. Considerable effort was devoted to analysis of interconnection strategies. O. Kolp describes some of these network simulations in his paper <ref> [14] </ref> "Performance Estimation for a Parallel System with a Hierarchical Switch Network". While GENESIS has had an impact on many subsequent projects, perhaps the most significant of these is Meiko's CS-2 MPP computer. Meiko was a GENESIS participant and the CS-2 design was influenced by the GENESIS project. J.
