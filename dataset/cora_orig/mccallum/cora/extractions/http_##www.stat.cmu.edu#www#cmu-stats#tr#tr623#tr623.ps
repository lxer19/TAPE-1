Reference-contexts: The way it achieves this consistency is by crudely approximating the Bayes factor, which is necessarily asymptotically consistent under fairly general conditions. (For example, from Doob's theorem <ref> (Doob 1949) </ref> the consistency of the Bayes factor follows easily, almost surely with respect to the prior.) The approximation ignores terms of constant order, including those arising from the prior.

Reference-contexts: The Schwarz criterion (which is also known as the Bayes Information Criterion or BIC, though in the usual definition 2S = BIC) is well-established in the literature on model selection (Smith and Spiegelhalter 1980), especially in time series analysis <ref> (Hannan 1980) </ref> where 1 its asymptotic consistency separates it from some of its competitors.

Reference-contexts: The heuristics appear sound, however, and we are confident that a rigorous extension is possible in such situations; we hope to have some further results on this in the future <ref> (following the approach of Kass, 11 Tierney, and Kadane, 1990) </ref>. In fact, the accuracy of the approximation (6) in the probit regression example indicates its applicability in non-i.i.d. settings | indeed, in settings in which exact null-orthogonality also does not hold.

Reference-contexts: Thus, an important problem is to define a reference Bayesian testing procedure that uses a non-flat, proper prior on the parameter of interest. The purpose of this note is to present such a procedure, which we find intuitively reasonable, and then show that it leads to the Schwarz criterion <ref> (Schwarz, 1978) </ref> and, furthermore, with a simple modification, generalizes a proposal in Jeffreys (1961, Chapter 5). We will also connect the idea with work of Smith and Spiegelhalter (1980) and Zellner and Siow (1980).
