Abstract: Radiosity is a global illumination method that takes into account all the light inter-reflections between the objects of a scene. It is particularly suitable for interior scenes. Nonetheless, recent applications such as architectural simulation or lighting design require the ability to modify the scene and also to deal with complex environments. This requirement has motivated research efforts in visibility processing [13] since visibility calculations are very important in the radios-ity method. The most time-consuming part corresponds to the computation of the form factors which represent, for two given parts of objects, the amount of light energy leaving one part that arrives at another one. Previous work has also attempted to deal with dynamic environments [3, 1, 2] but still suffers some limitations in the case of moving objects. Time-coherence is not accurately treated and a lot of unnecessary re-computations are performed. No method has yet been proposed which exactly identifies the form factors whose re-computation is strictly necessary. The video shows the use of the visibility complex for radiosity calculation. The visibility complex is a data structure representing the visibility relationships between objects in the plane which allows one to efficiently compute the form factors between objects for a given scene. In the case of dynamic environments, it will allow one to efficiently update only the modified form factors. This study in 2D will permit better understanding of the intricate visibility interactions for dynamic scenes, a step necessary for the development of truly efficient algorithms for radiosity in dynamic 3D environments. Some research in lighting simulation has already been carried out in 2D for discontinuity meshing and radios-ity calculations, see e.g. [5, 6]. tween radiating surfaces for illumination computations [12]. The light exchanges between surfaces are modeled by a system of equations. Surfaces are assumed to be Lambertian (i.e. to reflect incident light uniformly in all directions). To set up the system of equations, the environment is divided into small areas (or patches). The radiosity B i of a patch i is supposed to be constant over i, and can be expressed, for an environment discretized into n patches, as: B i = E i + ae i j=1 B j F ij , where E i is the light emitted from the patch P i , ae i is the reflectivity of this patch, and F ij is the form factor between the patches P i and P j , that is, the fraction of energy leaving P i that arrives at P j . 2 The visibility complex The visibility complex was introduced in [7] as an extension of the tangent visibility graph. It is a partition of the set of maximal free segments of a 2D scene according to their visibility. It was first studied for scenes of convex curved objects. In this video we consider scenes composed of simple polygons. An efficient way to visualize such a structure is to represent the segments in a dual space where a line y = ax + b in the scene is represented by the point (a; b) in this dual space. Thus, the set of lines going through a point of the scene is a line in the dual space. We represent the dual space in R 3 , the third dimension being used only to separate dual points representing segments sharing a same supporting line (which would otherwise be represented by a same dual point). The visibility complex is a 2D cellular complex. Its faces are 2D components of maximal free segments touching the same two objects. Its edges are 1D components of segments passing through one vertex of a polygon of the scene, and its vertices are segments passing through two vertices of polygons. An optimal construction algorithm has been proposed in [8] for scenes of convex objects in time O(m + n log n) and space O(n) where n is the number of objects and m the number of vertices of the complex. In the case of simple polygons, the optimal algorithm proposed in [11] has the same complexity with n the total number of vertices of the
