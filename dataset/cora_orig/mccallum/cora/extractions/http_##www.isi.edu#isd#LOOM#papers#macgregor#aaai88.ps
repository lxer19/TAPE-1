Title: A Deductive Pattern Matcher  
Author: Robert M. Mac Gregor 
Address: 4676 Admiralty Way, Suite 1001 Marina del Rey, CA 90292  
Affiliation: USC/Information Sciences Institute  
Abstract: This paper describes the design of a pattern matcher for a knowledge representation system called LOOM. The pattern matcher has a very rich pattern-forming language, and is logic-based, with a deductive mechanism which includes a truth-maintenance component as an integral part of the pattern-matching logic. The technology behind the LOOM matcher uses an inference engine called a classifier to perform the matches. The LOOM matcher is more expressive and more complete than previous classification-based pattern-matchers, and is expected to be significantly more efficient.

A classifier computes the subsumption relationship between a pair of concepts solely on the basis of the terminologically-specified definitions of the two concepts. Previous classification-based pattern matchers have equated the language used to express patterns with the terminological language used to define concepts.

Reference-contexts: LOOM instantiates the database object with all production rules that have that pattern as a pre-condition (left-hand-side). 7 Discussion In this section, we discuss some of the advantages, and one disadvantage, of LOOM's pattern-matching architecture. In particular, we contrast it with OPS5-style <ref> [Forgy, 1981] </ref> pattern matchers. Expressiveness of the Pattern Language LOOM's pattern language is both more and less expressive than the typical OPS5-style pattern language.

Reference-contexts: In the classification-based approach to pattern matching, an instance is matched to a pattern by first abstracting it, and then classifying the abstraction. This strategy is employed by two recent systems, KL-TWO [Vilain, 1985] and BACK <ref> [Luck et al., 1987; Nebel and Luck, 1987] </ref>. In this paper, we describe an extension of this approach which (1) is deductively more powerful than, and (2) is expected to be more efficient than, the strategies used in these earlier systems.

Reference-contexts: The tree shown in Figure 2 shows the result of classifying each of the concept definitions from The search algorithm employed by the LOOM classifier for applying subsumption tests was developed by Tom Lip-kis for the NIKL (see <ref> [Moser, 1983] </ref>) classifier. Here we list three properties which serve as a partial characterization of the Lipkis algorithm. We will use the word test to mean "perform a subsumption test on". Let N stand for the concept being classified: 1.

Reference-contexts: For example, in our knowledge base, Male (X) implies Person (X) for all individuals X; hence, Person subsumes Male.

Reference-contexts: This feature permits the OPS pattern matcher to function as the sole control-mechanism in an OPS program. The LOOM matcher is intended to be used in conjunction with a second programming language (as in, for example, <ref> [Yen et al., 1988] </ref>). The design of such a language (we currently use Lisp) is a topic for future research. Truth Maintenance LOOM's maintenance of types for all database objects effectively maintains truth-values for all unary predicates applied to all objects.
