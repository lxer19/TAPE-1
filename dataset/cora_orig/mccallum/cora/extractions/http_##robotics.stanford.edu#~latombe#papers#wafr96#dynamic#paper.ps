Abstract: We consider the following dynamic data structure problem. Given a collection of rigid bodies moving in 3-dimensional space and hinged together in a kinematic structure, our goal is to efficiently maintain a data structure that allows us to quickly answer range queries as the bodies move. This kinematic data structure problem arises in a variety of applications such as conformational search in molecular biology, simulation of hyper-redundant robots, collision detection, and computer animation. We study several models for dynamic maintenance of such structures and devise algorithms under these models. We obtain tight results on the worst-case, amortized, and randomized complexity of the data structure problem. For the o*ine version of the problem, we establish NP-hardness and provide efficient approximation algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The novel aspect of our problem is that the set of objects is fixed and the dynamization is due to their motion. Another related problem is the representation of multi-body systems (e.g., a collection of particles) for force calculation <ref> [1] </ref>. As in our problem, the bodies move but the set of bodies is fixed. However, due to the more involved mathematical form of the constraints on the relative motions of the bodies, prevailing solutions recompute the data structure from scratch at each step.

Reference-contexts: Except in very limited cases, it is compu-tationally infeasible to compute an explicit representation of the set of collision-free configurations the free space of such a robot. Instead, as discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>, one can approximate the geometry and connectivity of this set by randomly sampling the configuration space. The configurations picked at random are checked for collision and the collision-free ones are retained as milestones.
