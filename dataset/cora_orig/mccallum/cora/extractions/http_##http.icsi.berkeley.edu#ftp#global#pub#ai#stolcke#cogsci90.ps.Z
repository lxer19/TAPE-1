Title: Miniature Language Acquisition: A touchstone for cognitive science  
Author: Jerome A. Feldman, George Lakoff, Andreas Stolcke and Susan Hollbach Weber 
Address: Berkeley CA  
Affiliation: International Computer Science Institute,  
Abstract: Cognitive Science, whose genesis was interdisciplinary, shows signs of reverting to a disjoint collection of fields. This paper presents a compact, theory-free task that inherently requires an integrated solution. The basic problem is learning a subset of an arbitrary natural language from picture-sentence pairs. We describe a very specific instance of this task and show how it presents fundamental (but not impossible) challenges to several areas of cognitive science including vision, language, inference and learning.

Reference-contexts: Multiple scenes permit pronominal reference. 6. Trajectories: add "went between" to the definition of VT. The examples involving motion and time suggest the need for an extended range of semantic primitives. For a variety of reasons <ref> [Feldman, 1988] </ref>, we postulate that explicit trajectories will be an important primitive. It turns out that the trajectories are also useful in understanding some static scenes such as Figure 3 (c). Feldman, Lakoff, Stolcke & Weber 7

Reference-contexts: Compare Figure 4 (c) with "The smaller circle is above the larger square". 10. Over and Under: add `over' and `under' to the definition of REL1. This is a far from trivial extension, since the term `over' has dozens of related spatial senses <ref> [Lakoff, 1987] </ref>. For example, in Figure 3 (a), the circle is over (above) the square, while it is not in the topologically identical situation shown in Figure 3 (b). Another interesting asymmetry between `under' and `over' is depicted in Figure 4 (c). 11.

Reference-contexts: This is especially true of connectionist learning, which studies the learning of correlations among microfeatures, independent of content. One partial exception to this is language acquisition in the generative tradition, where a good deal of innateness is assumed <ref> [Pinker, 1989] </ref>. But there language acquisition is defined in a very limited way: "language acquisition" usually means just syntax acquisition and research has not attempted to characterize how people learn to describe what they see.

Reference-contexts: Among the things that cognitive science has studied most are visual perception, language, inference, and learning <ref> [Posner, 1989] </ref>. However, these are often studied as if they were isolated from one another. Studies in visual perception rarely address the questions of how we perceive higher-order spatial relations and what systems of spatial concepts there are in the languages of the world.
