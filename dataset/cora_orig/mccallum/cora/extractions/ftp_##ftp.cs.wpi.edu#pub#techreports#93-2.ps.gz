Abstract: This paper describes the application of multi-scale relaxation to automatically detect pavement distress. Pavement distress detection is a difficult task which simple edge detection schemes perform poorly. We have chosen to use relaxation labeling to improve upon an initial edge-based segmentation. This work is based upon a fractal model of pavement distress. The scale-invariance property of fractals suggests that information at different scales of resolution may be combined to improve segmentation. Thus, we have developed a multi-scale relaxation technique for use in a pavement distress detection system. Straightforward linear interactions fail to capture the complexity of pixel interactions for this problem. To better model pixel interactions, we have included non-linear terms in the relaxation process. Symmetry arguments and careful engineering allow a 93% reduction in the complexity of this approach. To demonstrate the necessity of the multi-scale approach, examples with and without multi-scale relaxation are shown. We found that performance was greatly improved by multi-scale relaxation.

Reference-contexts: In order to detect such a small component of the image, the system must exploit the properties of the distress [ELK91b]. Standard image processing techniques applied to pavement inspection have only met with limited success <ref> [CHI83, CUR84, ELK91b, GOS91] </ref>. Highly non-uniform paving material comprises most of the distress image, and boundaries between these materials must be eliminated for successful detection of distress.

Reference-contexts: Images generated using this system have a resolution of .75mm/pixel [ELK91a]. The intensity ranges of the different regions in the image are often very close together, and distress pixels can be brighter, darker, or the same as the aggregate pixels <ref> [ELK90] </ref>. In order to successfully model the distress, another property of the distress can be used. Cracks have been shown to be fractal in [GEN91]. This is a useful property of distress which can be exploited to differentiate the distress from the rest of the features in the image.

Reference-contexts: Since there are no generic sizes or shapes, cracks are particularly hard to detect. The images used in this image have been produced by the PASCO system [SOL91].

Pixels which correspond to distress larger than 1.5mm within 3 pavement images comprise only 0:1% of the image generated from a lane-km of pavement <ref> [ELK91a] </ref>.

This is a useful property of distress which can be exploited to differentiate the distress from the rest of the features in the image.

Reference-contexts: An interesting property of fractals which can be exploited is self- similarity. A fractal object will appear to have the same fractal dimension, regardless of the scale that is used or the distance from the object <ref> [GLE87] </ref>. Since a crack is a fractal curve, it will look the same regardless of the scale at which the it is viewed. Not all of the data in pavement images are of use for automatic distress detection.

Reference-contexts: The initial labelings may be inconsistent. Relaxation is used to iteratively update the labels in an image, based upon labels at neighboring points in order to arrive at a more consistent set of labels <ref> [HUM83] </ref>. In this work, the labels are treated as probabilities, which imposes additional constraints on the label set: the labels must be non-negative and sum to one. 2.1 Least Squares Approximation A least squares approximation is used as the update rule in the relaxation algorithm.
