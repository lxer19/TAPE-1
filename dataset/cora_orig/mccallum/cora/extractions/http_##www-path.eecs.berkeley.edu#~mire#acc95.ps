Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical control architecture for dealing with faults and adverse environmental conditions on an Automated Highway System (AHS). Our design builds on a previously developed control architecture [1] for normal operating conditions. The faults considered in the extended architecture are classified by capabilities remaining on the vehicle or roadside after the fault has occurred. The set of available capabilities is used by supervisors in each of the layers of the hierarchy to select appropriate control strategies. We outline the control strategies needed by the supervisors and give examples of their detailed operation.

Reference-contexts: The magnitude of the de 1 Research supported by the PATH program, Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California, Berkeley under MOU 135 sign problem leads to a hierarchical control structure which facilitates complexity management. The control hierarchy for normal operation outlined in <ref> [1] </ref> is based on the idea of "platooning". A platoon is a group of tightly spaced vehicles with separations of about 1 meter and with an inter-platoon distance of the order of 30 meters. It has been shown that platooning results in a substantial increase in capacity and safety. <p> It has been shown that platooning results in a substantial increase in capacity and safety. However, platooning requires automatic control of vehicles, as human drivers are not fast or reliable enough to produce the kinds of inputs necessary for maintaining a platoon. In the architecture outlined in <ref> [1] </ref> the controller is organized in four layers. Starting from the top, The network layer, is responsible for flow of traffic on a highway network. Its objective is to prevent congestion and maximize throughput by dynamic routing of traffic. <p> Therefore they are better suited to control capacity. Lower levels have access to more detailed information and are better suited to control safety. 2.1. Quantitative Capability Structure The control scheme for normal operating conditions presented in <ref> [1] </ref> relies on a number of sensors, actuators and communication devices, both on the vehicles and on the roadside. All this additional hardware as well as the standard mechanical parts of the vehicle are prone to failure.

Reference-contexts: The definition of "normal" may vary from case to case, but, in general, it means benign environmental conditions and faultless operation of all the hardware, both on the vehicles and on the roadside. Some studies to deal with "abnormal" conditions have been made (for example <ref> [2, 3, 4] </ref>), but they have been concerned with specific faults rather than a general framework. <p> Its objective is to prevent congestion and maximize throughput by dynamic routing of traffic. The link layer is responsible for maximizing flow on a section (link) ensuring that vehicles make their exits. It also manages incidents (reducing congestion) by commanding maneuvers, such as lane changes, to groups of vehicles <ref> [2] </ref>. The coordination layer, which resides in the vehicles, is responsible for coordinating the movement of platoons with their neighbors. The design of [5] uses protocols, in the form of finite state machines, that systematically execute maneuvers such as merging two platoons, splitting a platoon, and lane change.

The coordination layer of [5] requires a vehicle to be able to perform certain maneuvers and this capability is encoded in the regulation layer supervisor capability vector. In addition to execute the protocols that organize the maneuvers, the coordination layer needs access to communication capabilities.

Reference-contexts: If the desired P cannot be achieved by tuning, the corresponding predicate is set to zero and the supervisor selects another control law (see Figure 4). 2.3. Classification of faults by capability A comprehensive list of faults pertaining to vehicle as well as infrastructure failures can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. To simplify the task of designing degraded modes, the faults were grouped in six classes according to the capabilities remaining to the vehicle/system after the fault has occurred.

Reference-contexts: Thus it can be considered as a reciprocal of the normal mode merge maneuver. The maneuvers Forced Split and Emergency Lane Change are variations of the normal mode maneuvers split and lane change. Due to space limitations, we do not describe these maneuvers and strategies in detail. (c.f. <ref> [7] </ref>) 3.3. Regulation layer control laws Most of the coordination layer maneuvers described above can be performed by tuning the regulation layer feedback control laws designed for normal mode maneuvers.
