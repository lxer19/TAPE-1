Reference-contexts: For a self-stabilizing running machine, the actuator goes through a repeating, predetermined cycle while the actual joint may vary from the actuator position by compressing or extending the spring. Arbitrary contact is a difficult problem for rigid-body simulations <ref> (Baraff 1989) </ref>(Moore & Wilhelms 1988)(Hahn 1988). For two rigid bodies to avoid interpenetrating, they must stop when they hit. Because the simulator applies forces, and forces result in accelerations, the only way to completely stop the bodies is to apply an impulse which cancels the bodies' relative velocity.

Reference-contexts: This method allows me to emulate a curved foot on arbitrary ground with a reasonable degree of accuracy. It is simpler and more compatible with the simulation than other contact models proposed for curved surfaces <ref> (Baraff 1990) </ref>. The simulation does not include minor effects such as air resistance. Nor does it include the possibility of a limited amount of power being available to move the actuators, or external disturbances.

Reference-contexts: Running is juggling where you have an actuator attached to a bouncing body, rather than a bouncing body hitting a moving actuator. <ref> (Buhler 1990) </ref> demonstrates that simple feedback control can stabilize the hopping height of a juggled ball. Stefan Schall and Christopher Atkeson take this one step further and show that if the paddle path is properly designed one does not need feedback to juggle a ball vertically (Schaal & Atkeson 1993).

LEGGED LOCOMOTION 19 and Caughey extend Koditschek and Buhler's model, relaxing some assumptions <ref> (Burdick, Vakakis, & Caughey 1989) </ref>. They discover that given the proper parameters the monopod will exhibit hopping motion of any desired period, even or odd, or chaotic motion. Their analysis relies upon the fact that the monopod, confined to vertical motion, has essentially one degree of freedom. <p> Additionally, the monopod bounces on its legs in a manner similar to McGeer's and Raibert's robots. As mentioned in section 2.2, a monopod with feedback can exhibit any period gait, including chaotic motion (Koditschek & Buhler 1991) <ref> (Burdick, Vakakis, & Caughey 1989) </ref>. The relevant analysis depends on the fact that the maximum hopping height of the monopod completely determines the motion of the next hop.

Reference-contexts: Some animals, such as camels, pace naturally. Horses can be trained to pace <ref> (Gambaryan 1974) </ref>. A physical robot already has been programmed to pace using Raibert's virtual leg controller (Raibert 1990). The roll stability of a pacing quadruped is fairly difficult to control, since it results in changes in the hopping height, which then change the touchdown and takeoff times.

Reference-contexts: Koditschek and Buhler, taking a simplified monopod and mathematically analyzing it, show that period 1 and period 2 gaits exist <ref> (Koditschek & Buhler 1991) </ref>. <p> Additionally, the monopod bounces on its legs in a manner similar to McGeer's and Raibert's robots. As mentioned in section 2.2, a monopod with feedback can exhibit any period gait, including chaotic motion <ref> (Koditschek & Buhler 1991) </ref> (Burdick, Vakakis, & Caughey 1989). The relevant analysis depends on the fact that the maximum hopping height of the monopod completely determines the motion of the next hop. <p> In its most general form, it is highly unlikely since it includes such absurd starting conditions as upside down or underground. For simple models, such as a linear monopod which cannot pitch or move horizontally, it is possible to prove global stability <ref> (Koditschek & Buhler 1991) </ref>. It is sometimes possible to determine a smaller set of initial conditions which are guaranteed to converge. This is no longer global stability, it is local.

Reference-contexts: Other possibilities for finding footholds include laser range finders, human assistance, video analysis, and "feeling" the ground with the feet to find appropriate footholds. The Ambler deals with slipping feet by using a conservative support polygon <ref> (Krotkov & Simmons 1996) </ref>. If a robot has m legs on the ground, the conservative support polygon is the intersection of the m 1 support polygons created by removing any one leg. <p> It traversed rough terrain, with a human operator on board. * The Ambler, built at Carnegie-Mellon University, was another self-contained hexa-pod <ref> (Krotkov & Simmons 1996) </ref>. An interesting feature was that the legs have identical work spaces, allowing it to use a circulating gait. That is, it could consistently pick up whichever leg happened to be in the rear and place it in front.

Reference-contexts: Thompson and Raibert, limiting themselves to springs and a mechanical system, found reentrant running motions in a simulated hopping machine (Thompson & Raibert 1989). McGeer's demonstrates a stable system walking downhill under the influence of gravity <ref> (McGeer 1989) </ref> (McGeer 1990). McGeer's passive dynamic robots are pairs of mechanical legs which walk downhill stably without any motors, sensors, or computers. Also, a recent pattern-based cockroach simulation generated stable dynamic running without feedback. <p> Active control systems can stabilize groucho runners in a manner similar to normal running. 2.3 Passively Stabilized Locomotion By properly designing the robot, is it possible to passively locomote by a simple interaction of gravity and inertia, with no actuators, no sensing, and no computers. <ref> (McGeer 1989) </ref> describes a simulation of a passive dynamic running machine; (McGeer 1990) also describes a physical passive dynamic walking machine. I illustrate both machines in Figure 2-5. In some respects, McGeer's work distills walking to its essence: a simple set of motions generated by a simple mechanism. <p> Springs at the hips bring the proper leg forward to continue running. Again, with the proper spring constants, leg lengths, and mass properties this type of mechanism can run stably. However, some modes are extremely difficult to stabilize reliably and the set of valid initial conditions is small <ref> (McGeer 1989) </ref>. 2.4 Self-Stabilizing Running A self-stabilizing running robot has no computer, but does have actuators which go through a fixed, repeating cycle. For my studies of self-stabilizing running I assume each actuator operates in series with a spring at its joint.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, each leg has a duty factor fi i of each leg, the fraction of the running cycle that the leg is on the ground <ref> (McGhee 1968) </ref>. Under normal circumstances fi i is assumed to be the same for each foot. Note that fi i can be fairly large and still have the creature exhibit running behavior (McMahon, Valiant, & Frederick 1987).

Reference-contexts: Many researchers have built statically stable walking robots. A few examples are: * Robert McGhee built a hexapod at Ohio State University <ref> (McGhee 1983) </ref>. It walked with various gaits over level ground, negotiated obstacles and rough terrain (with some human assistance choosing footholds). The basic control commanded foot velocities, CHAPTER 2.

Reference-contexts: It is worth noting that, by bending the knees, it is possible to run without having a ballistic phase. This type of running is known as groucho running <ref> (McMahon, Valiant, & Frederick 1987) </ref>. <p> Under normal circumstances fi i is assumed to be the same for each foot.

Reference-contexts: The only way I know to determine if the low bandwidth feedback will disrupt the self-stabilizing motions is to try them. Previous dynamic legged robots, such as those presented in (Raibert et al. 1992) (Ringrose 1992b) <ref> (Murthy & Raibert 1983) </ref>, did not take advantage of self-stabilizing running because the conditions required for stable running were not known. I have created simulations of one, two, and four legged robots. <p> Foot placement at touchdown controls the velocity (Figure 2-4). Finally, the leg consists of a spring in series with an actuator, and extending or retracting the actuator during stance alters the hopping height as the robot bounces on the spring <ref> (Murthy & Raibert 1983) </ref>. Koditschek and Buhler, taking a simplified monopod and mathematically analyzing it, show that period 1 and period 2 gaits exist (Koditschek & Buhler 1991).

Reference-contexts: It is capable of gaits, including transverse and rotary gallops, which have not been demonstrated by other controllers, such as the virtual leg controller <ref> (Raibert, Chepponis, & Brown 1986) </ref>. On the other hand, there are some significant drawbacks to self-stabilizing running. * There is no mechanism for input. An operator cannot command speed or direction. <p> When the foot is placed further from the hip than the neutral point, the body decelerates during stance and the forward speed at liftoff is slower than the forward speed at touchdown (right) (Figure and caption from (Raibert & Hodgins 1991), adapted from <ref> (Raibert 1986) </ref>). 3 motion is not stable. A robot bouncing on one leg will gradually tilt, and eventually tip over. Actively stabilized robots use a control system to counteract the instability present in most rapid running motions. <p> Prepositioning the unused leg also results in the two legs moving in opposite directions, reducing the pitch disturbances caused by the leg inertia. On the other hand, if the two legs are in phase one can control them using a virtual leg strategy <ref> (Raibert, Chepponis, & Brown 1986) </ref>. After both feet touch down, control the legs to emulate a single virtual leg placed between them, and use the monopod hopping strategy on the single virtual leg. A quadrupedal running strategy emerges naturally from bipedal running. Split the quadruped's legs into two pairs.
