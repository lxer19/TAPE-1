Reference-contexts: Determine the smallest number e k (n) such that any geometric graph with n vertices and m &gt; e k (n) edges contains k +1 pairwise disjoint edges. By a result of Hopf and Pannwitz [HP] and Erd-os [E], e 1 (n) = n. Alon and Erd-os <ref> [AE] </ref> showed that e 2 (n) 6n which was improved by Goddard, Katchalski and Kleitman [GKK] to e 2 (n) 3n. The best known lower bound, e 2 (n) 2:5n 4, is due to Perles (see [PA]).

Lemma 5 is not stated in [GKK] explicitly. However, its proof (relatively long case-analysis) is readily contained in the proof of Theorem 2 in [GKK].

Denote the vertices by v 1 ; : : : ; v n from left to right, and assume that no pair of them lies on a vertical line.

Reference-contexts: We get the recursion e k (n) 6 and Theorem 6 follows. 2 If the number of edges in a geometric graph is at least (n 2 ), then Theorem 1 guarantees (n 1=3 ) pairwise disjoint edges. This is improved by the following result of Pach <ref> [P] </ref>. Theorem 8 ([P]) For any c &gt; 0 there is a c 0 &gt; 0 such that every geometric graph of n vertices and at least cn 2 edges has at least c 0 p n pairwise disjoint edges.
