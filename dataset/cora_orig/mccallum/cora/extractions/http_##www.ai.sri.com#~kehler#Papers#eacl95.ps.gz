Abstract: We argue that the resource sharing that is commonly manifest in semantic accounts of coordination is instead appropriately handled in terms of structure-sharing in LFG f-structures. We provide an extension to the previous account of LFG semantics (Dalrymple et al., 1993a) according to which dependencies between f-structures are viewed as resources; as a result a one-to-one correspondence between uses of f-structures and meanings is maintained. The resulting system is sufficiently restricted in cases where other approaches overgenerate; the very property of resource-sensitivity for which resource sharing appears to be problematic actually provides explanatory advantages over systems that more freely replicate re sources during derivation.

Reference-contexts: The meaning language could be that of any appropriate logic; for present purposes, higher-order logic will suffice. Expressions of the meaning language (such as Bill ) appear on the right side of the meaning relation ;. The glue language is the tensor fragment of linear logic <ref> (Girard, 1987) </ref>. The semantic contribution of each lexical entry, which we will refer to as a meaning constructor, is a linear-logic formula consisting of instructions in the glue language for combining the meanings of the lexical entry's syntactic arguments to obtain the meaning of the f-structure headed by the entry.
