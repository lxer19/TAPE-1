Reference-contexts: Von Neumann proved that every acyclic digraph has a unique kernel. Later Richardson proved that in any kernel-less digraph there is an odd directed cycle. A very short proof of the last fact is given by Berge and Duchet in their survey <ref> [1] </ref> on kernels in digraphs. Thus, odd directed cycles are the simplest kernel-less digraphs. Let us note that removing an edge from such a cycle we get an acyclic digraph which has a (unique) kernel.

Reference-contexts: Thus, odd directed cycles are the simplest kernel-less digraphs. Let us note that removing an edge from such a cycle we get an acyclic digraph which has a (unique) kernel. In the late 70-s 1 Pierre Duchet <ref> [2] </ref> conjectured that there are no other connected digraphs with this property. In other words, for every connected kernel-less digraph which is not an odd directed cycle, there exists an edge which can be removed and the obtained digraph is still kernel-less. Clearly, this would strengthen the Richardson theorem. <p> Thus, all the kernels are given by the periodical circular sequences of distances with periods: [3], or <ref> [9; 2; 2; 2] </ref>, or [6; 3; 2; 4; 5; 4; 2; 3]. <p> Thus, all the kernels are given by the periodical circular sequences of distances with periods: [3], or [9; 2; 2; 2], or <ref> [6; 3; 2; 4; 5; 4; 2; 3] </ref>. <p> = f3; 5; 8; 14; 17; 19; 23; 28; 32; 34; 37; 43g: Let us note that circular distances between the neibours 6; 3; 2; 4; 5; 4; 1; 4; 5; 4; 2; 3; 3; 2; 3; 6; 3; 2; 4; 5; 4; 2; 3; 6: are related to periods <ref> [9; 2; 2; 2] </ref> and [6; 3; 2; 4; 5; 4; 2; 3]. <p> 17; 19; 23; 28; 32; 34; 37; 43g: Let us note that circular distances between the neibours 6; 3; 2; 4; 5; 4; 1; 4; 5; 4; 2; 3; 3; 2; 3; 6; 3; 2; 4; 5; 4; 2; 3; 6: are related to periods [9; 2; 2; 2] and <ref> [6; 3; 2; 4; 5; 4; 2; 3] </ref>.

The family of circular graphs can be used as a test not only in this case; see also <ref> [3] </ref>. We could compare circular graphs with a bore-well which is very narrow but it can be made deep enough to meet some interesting layers of graphs with some prescribed ("circular") properties.
