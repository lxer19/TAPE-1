Title: Generating Process Explanations in Nuclear Astrophysics  
Author: Sakir Kocabas and Pat Langley 
Abstract: In this paper we describe ASTRA, a computational aid for generating process explanations in nuclear astrophysics. The system operates in two stages, the first using knowledge of quantum theory to produce a set of legal reactions among elements and the second searching for pathways of such reactions that explain the construction of some element from lighter ones. ASTRA has found apparently novel reactions that involve proton and neutron capture, as well as novel fusion reactions that produce neutrons and deuterium. The system has also generated reaction pathways for helium, carbon, and oxygen that do not appear in the scientific literature. However, ASTRA also finds many other reaction pathways that are less interesting and that suggest priorities for future research.

Reference-contexts: Such reactions take part in processes called `hydrogen burning', in which hydrogen atoms are continuously transformed into helium atoms. We have found 33 examples of proton captures given in astrophysics texts <ref> (e.g., Fowler et al., 1967, 1975) </ref> for elements from hydrogen (H) to oxygen ( 16 O); most concern strong interactions, although some, identified by neutrino emissions, involve weak interactions.

Reference-contexts: As we noted in Section 3, our system shares many goals and techniques with Valdes-Perez' Mechem, which discovers reaction pathways in physical chemistry. Another close relative is SynGen <ref> (Hendrickson, 1995) </ref>, which addresses the task of chemical synthesis in which one must determine not only the reaction paths but also the starting molecules. A more detailed similarity is that both ASTRA and Syn-Gen generate pathways by chaining backward from the final products using known reactions.

Reference-contexts: The basic operation at this stage is equivalent to one module of the BR-4 system, which we have described elsewhere <ref> (Kocabas & Langley, 1995) </ref>. Note that this process generates not only fusion reactions, considered the mainstay of nuclear astrophysics, but also decay reactions, in which one element breaks into others. <p> Our system differs mainly from these earlier algorithms in its focus on astrophysics and in its ability to generate the basic reactions from the elements involved and the principles of quantum physics.

Reference-contexts: evaluation, as we discuss next. 5 Discussion of Results We have been careful to compare ASTRA's outputs, at both the reaction and pathway level, to those available in astrophysics texts (Adouze & Vauclair, 1990; Clayton, 1983; Kippenhahn & Weigert, 1994; Lang, 1974; Fowler et al., 1967, 1975) and particle physics <ref> (Williams, 1991) </ref>. Of course, an exhaustive comparison to these fields' literatures would be intractable, but we have combined our search with analyses by an established plasma physicist, whose expertise should complement that available in our sample of the written record.
