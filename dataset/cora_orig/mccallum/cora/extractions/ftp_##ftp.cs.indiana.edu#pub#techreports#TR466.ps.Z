Title: Experiments in Path Optimization via Pheromone Trails by Simulated Robots  
Author: Jason L. Almeter 
Date: September 17, 1996  
Abstract: Ants lay pheromone trails to lead other individuals to a destination. Due to stochastic variations in path following, these paths become optimized. Aspects of this behavior were considered using a simulation modeled on a physical robot colony. Milling and path optimization were observed. This led to the conclusion that, though simplistic, the model captures several interesting features of ant trail following including circu lar milling in several Eciton species.

Reference-contexts: Instead, the robots detect the "scent" of their peers when they are too close and move away from them. 3.2 Robot The robots have very simple behavioral controllers vaguely reminiscent of the subsumption architecture <ref> (Brooks, 1986) </ref>. The most basic response of the robots is to avoid the walls of their arena and other robots. When they are too close 2 to a wall or robot, they turn away from it until they are no longer pointed at it.

Reference-contexts: These applications require that many distributed objects be located quickly and efficiently by a team of agents. Similarly, ants must accomplish this task every day in order to survive. Ants manage this task robustly <ref> (Franks & Fletcher, 1983) </ref> with the meager allotment of roughly 500,000 neurons per individual. 2 Purpose of Experiment The goal in this work has been to model the behavior of ants in order to gain insight into models of simplified foraging tasks for robots.

Reference-contexts: This behavior simplifies the data logging for the experiment by creating clearly defined end points for the paths. The biological footing is more tenuous: ants do use multiple signaling pheromones <ref> (Holldobler & Wilson, 1990) </ref>, but most ants generally only lay trails when returning to the nest with food.

Reference-contexts: When presented with a choice between two trails of differing lengths (Goss et al., 1989; Deneubourg & Goss, 1989) or a choice between two food sources (Pasteels et al., 1987), the reinforcement of the selection can be seen as a form of Hebbian learning <ref> (Millonas, 1992) </ref>. If an ant at a fork F with a choice between branches A and B chooses A and leaves pheromone, then future ants will be more likely to choose A.

Reference-contexts: Future work will extend the model so that further learning questions can be addressed.

Reference-contexts: This appears to happen because the robots receptive fields are in front of the turn axis of the robot, so that the robot perceives the turn in the trail before it gets to it and `cuts the corner'. Ants exhibit a similar behavior <ref> (Schneirla, 1944) </ref>, but via a different underlying mechanism: 3 (A)fter Ecitons have formed a column around a glass jar on a glass substratum, removal of the jar leaves a regular circular procession which usually is able to maintain its formation for a considerable time. <p> of instances, Ecitons ceased trekking around the outside edge in running around the top surface of a square wooden block, gradually shifting to a course that cut the corners more and more, until finally they followed a circular course which neared the edge only at the center of each side <ref> (Schneirla, 1944, pg. 10) </ref>. A tripartite mechanism was identified in the case of the Ecitons. The ants turn towards a weak tactile stimulation, away from a strong tactile stimulation, and up the pheromone gradient (Schneirla, 1944). <p> A tripartite mechanism was identified in the case of the Ecitons. The ants turn towards a weak tactile stimulation, away from a strong tactile stimulation, and up the pheromone gradient <ref> (Schneirla, 1944) </ref>. The primary differences between the resulting behavior appear to be in the number of agents needed for path optimization to occur and in the robots' tendency to lose the wall. In the former case, a single robot has been seen to be sufficient for path optimization. <p> Region A of the plot (durations from zero to 27 minutes) corresponds to trails which are not long enough for the robot to catch before they evaporate. In this case they walk along the edge of the colony, much like Schneirla's ants <ref> (Schneirla, 1944) </ref>. The robots are not actually attracted to the walls, but since they are only repelled by the walls while pointed at them the effect is similar for the straight walls of the current colony.
