Reference-contexts: As discussed be-low, a systematic statistical evaluation using our methodology can be used to accomplish these objectives. Briefly, SINS consists of a navigation module, which uses a schema-based reactive control method <ref> (Arkin, 1989) </ref>, and an on-line adaptation and learning module, which uses case-based reasoning and reinforcement learning methods (Ram & Santamara, 1993a). The navigation module is responsible for moving the robot through the terrain from the starting location to the desired goal location while avoiding obstacles along the way.

Reference-contexts: The linear regression model in Equation 1 is very general and can incorporate a wide range of smooth functional relations. For example, ablation studies analyze the partial increment/decrement in the system's performance with the addition/elimination of a system component <ref> (Cohen & Howe, 1988) </ref>. Such analyses can be performed using a regression model in which categorical variables can take on the values 1 or 0 to indicate whether a system component is present or not.

Reference-contexts: This follows from the fact that any functional relationship can be approximated by a series of polynomials with any degree of accuracy as the number of terms of the polynomials increases <ref> (Munroe, 1963) </ref>. A common problem when constructing a model is selecting appropriate independent variables to use from the set of all the possible variables that might be considered. Selecting all possible independent variables in the model may artificially reduce the error between the data and model due to overfitting.

Reference-contexts: Categorical variables represent discrete alternatives, such as different representational vocabularies, different domain theories, or different adaptation algorithms that can be used in various modules of the system. 7 A widely used inferential statistical technique is regression analysis using least-squared error (LSE) <ref> (Neter et al, 1989) </ref>. LSE estimates the model coefficients (the fi j 's in equation 1) by minimizing the squared sum of the residuals (" i ) across the sample.

The navigation module is responsible for moving the robot through the terrain from the starting location to the desired goal location while avoiding obstacles along the way. A set of control parameters can be used to change the behavior of the navigation module.

Reference-contexts: The model coefficients represent the influence of each factor (X j i) on the performance of the system (Y i ). LSE estimation is widely used because of its properties; in particular, the Gauss-Markov theorem establishes that LSE estimators for regression models are the best linear unbiased estimators possible <ref> (Weld, 1916) </ref>. The linear regression model in Equation 1 is very general and can incorporate a wide range of smooth functional relations. For example, ablation studies analyze the partial increment/decrement in the system's performance with the addition/elimination of a system component (Cohen & Howe, 1988).
