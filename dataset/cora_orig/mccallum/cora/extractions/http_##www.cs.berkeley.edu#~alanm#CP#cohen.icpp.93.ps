Abstract: At present, a prototype of ATOMIC is operational including an IP interface for the BSD UNIX 2 environment. The developmental VME Host Interface (HI) boards have four memoryless Mosaic chips creating four network interfaces. Each interface is equipped with 25MHz SRAM memory chips that are accessible to the host Sun-3 workstation via the VME bus. These HI boards were able to obtain the following performance: a single interface acting as a source can send 381 megabits per second (Mb/s) if 1,500 byte packets are used. Longer packets allow us to approach 400Mb/s, the limit of the 25Mhz

Reference-contexts: As a packet passes through Mosaic nodes, its leading prefix is decremented until it reaches zero. All X-direction routing occurs before Y-direction routing. This restriction avoids deadlock <ref> [6] </ref>. The Mosaic chip is the building block for both the HI boards and the switches.

Reference-contexts: Crays network is operational and connects 11 Cray machines using two switches. The LLNL work is still in the prototype stage but they expect to create a switch with 2048 ports with link speeds of 800Mb/s. There are two main differences between HIPPI [11] or Fibre Channel <ref> [8] </ref> and ATOMIC, the first is cost and the type of machines that will be on the network and the second is connection setup time. The HIPPI and FC networks are designed with large, expensive machines in mind.

Reference-contexts: It is practical to have multiple interfaces within a workstation, individually associated with high-speed peripherals or processors. This makes it possible for data to be routed to and from these interfaces at gigabit rates independently of buses or backplanes <ref> [9] </ref>. 4.2 Mesh Routers Arrays of Mosaic chips can be interconnected with one another in a two dimensional mesh. In an ATOMIC LAN, meshes of Mosaic chips function as crossbar switches. <p> ATOMIC supports IP, but with a software change could support ATM or any network protocol. One additional point should be stressed. The low cost of nodes coupled with their programmability makes it practical to utilize them in workstation architecture <ref> [9] </ref>. The network is then extended into the workstation. This allows internal devices to have their own independent Gb/s interconnect in addition to direct network access. It has also been suggested that ATM could be used for this, although switching would be external [4][10]. 9.1.2 HIPPI and Fibre Channel LANs. <p> The HIPPI and FC networks are designed with large, expensive machines in mind. ATOMIC is designed to provide low-cost, high-speed connectivity to all classes of machines. In fact, we advocate using many network interfaces in a single machine interconnected with ribbon cables <ref> [9] </ref>! HIPPI and Fibre Channel LANs are connection-oriented and optimized for large transfers between super-computer-class machines. Packet transmission requires an explicit connect operation. ATOMIC is a packet-switched technology and is better suited to LAN environments with less expensive workstations and smaller transfers between hosts.

Cray has created a HIPPI LAN at its facility in Minnesota <ref> [13] </ref> and LLNL is using Fibre Channel as the basis for its circuit-switched local area network [15].

Reference-contexts: ATM messages are of fixed length. Each is 53 bytes long with five bytes reserved for header, leaving a 48 byte payload. Several teams are creating prototype ATM host interfaces and networks [2][7][20]. The Autonet follow-on, AN2, will have ATM switches <ref> [14] </ref>. ATOMIC sends variable length packets and it uses the distributed computational and routing capability of a mesh. This sets ATOMIC well apart from ATM-based LANs. The fragmentation and reassembly required when ATM carries higher layer traffic are not required in ATOMIC.

Reference-contexts: In the table below, the expected performance of a 64-processor ATOMIC mesh using Mosaic-C and the upcoming Mosaic-T [17] is compared to both the Autonet switch <ref> [16] </ref> and Nectar HUB [1]. For each switch we list TABLE 3. A Comparison of Various Switches. <p> A mesh contains 64 Mosaic chips, each with a router, each independent, while an Autonet switch contains one router. A 64-processor dual-connected mesh is externally similar to a 16-by-16 Nectar HUB crossbar. Some of the details of the Autonet project <ref> [16] </ref> at DEC Systems Research Center are similar to ATOMIC. The Autonet LAN is also a switch-based network, and it uses point-to-point links of 100Mb/s over coaxial cable. One difference between the two projects lies in packet addressing.

Reference-contexts: Other tests have demonstrated throughput of 5.25 million packets per second over a single Mosaic channel. This paper describes the architecture and performance of ATOMIC. 1.0 Overview ATOMIC is an O (gigabit) speed, low cost, LAN built by USC/ISI. It relies on the repetitive application of Caltechs Mosaic chip <ref> [17] </ref> (see Section 3.0), that serves as a fast and smart switching element. It is capable of routing variable length packets while providing added value through simultaneous computing and buffering. ATOMIC scales easily by adding point to point channels and has a low interface cost. <p> Though unable to remove the problem completely, mesh exibility can be used in conjunction with the AC to alter the network routing paths in response to congestion. In the table below, the expected performance of a 64-processor ATOMIC mesh using Mosaic-C and the upcoming Mosaic-T <ref> [17] </ref> is compared to both the Autonet switch [16] and Nectar HUB [1]. For each switch we list TABLE 3. A Comparison of Various Switches.

Reference-contexts: Caltech has created Slack chips that employ FIFOs to eliminate this bottleneck. These chips buffer the incoming bytes and fake the acknowledgment signal. The Mosaic channels are then able to transfer data at the normal rate of 500Mb/s <ref> [18] </ref>. Using Slack chips and drivers, TABLE 1. Single ow measured performance.

Reference-contexts: Switch-Based LANs On the surface, an ATOMIC 8-by-8 mesh router may resemble a switch. It bears some similarity to a space division crossbar switch with a self-routing property <ref> [19] </ref>. But unlike traditional switch elements, each Mosaic-C node contains its own CPU and program store. Each node can buffer and perform a function on the messages that it receives. A Mosaic-C node router is symmetric in two dimensions and independent from the processor.
