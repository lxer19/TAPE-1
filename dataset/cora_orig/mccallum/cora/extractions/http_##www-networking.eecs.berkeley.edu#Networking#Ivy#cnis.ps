Abstract: We propose a comprehensive admission control and resource management strategy that exploits statistical multiplexing to support connections with diverse characteristics and requirements. At the first level traffic is classified into three broad categories: real-time, which has both delay and loss constraints, non-real-time, which is only loss-sensitive, and best-effort. Due to their tight delay constraints, real-time traffic cannot tolerate extensive buffering in the network. Thus the network cannot rely on the smoothing effect of buffers and must achieve small losses only by multiplexing a large number of sources so that the aggregate input rate rarely exceeds the capacity. We present an accurate estimate of the overflow probability for real-time traffic based on a theorem by Bahadur and Rao. On the other hand, existing results of large buffer asymptotics, such as effective and decoupling bandwidths, lend themselves to the analysis of non-real-time sources. We propose a simple resource allocation scheme in which service priority is given to real-time traffic. The non-real-time traffic is then buffered and served with the remaining capacity. Furthermore, we present a result that simplifies the tasks of traffic description and policing for real-time sources. We show that for fixed mean and peak rates, the on-off sources result in the largest overflow probability. Thus one can devise a call admission policy that bases its acceptance decision on these simple parameters and the worst-case assumption, such that the decision will always satisfy the quality of service constraints for arbitrary traffic distribution.

We ask the question: given a traffic descriptor, is it possible to derive a universal least upper bound on the overflow probability for all underlying distributions? If such a bound is available, then a call admission policy based on this bound would consequently satisfy the overflow constraint.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, in order to maintain low overflow probability, statistical multiplexing must be exploited in one of two ways: by averaging traffic over time in a large buffer, or by multiplexing a large number of sources when the buffer is negligible <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, a stream preserves its effective bandwidth if C is larger than the sum of its decoupling bandwidth ff fl (ffi) and the average rate of all other streams sharing the buffer.

Reference-contexts: Note that for K &gt; 2, eqs. 9 do not have solutions. This means that there is no local maximum in the interior of the non-negative orthant, and the global maximum must occur at the boundary where one or more q i 's are set to zero <ref> [12] </ref>. Indeed, one can repeat the argument and show that at the global maximum all but two q i 's are zero.

Reference-contexts: The idea of not buffering real-time traffic might seem surprising at first glance. However, note that the amount of buffering that such connections can tolerate is limited due to their delay constraints. As we demonstrate in <ref> [14] </ref>, such small buffers can only provide negligible improvement in the loss rate. <p> In the second case (many sources), we have obtained a good estimate of the overflow probability using a theorem by Bahadur and Rao <ref> [14] </ref>, which also provides a simple way to determine the maximum number of acceptable real-time connections. These existing results are reviewed in section 2. One potential drawback of the above approaches lies in their dependence on 2 the statistical model of each source. <p> For stability, assume c &gt; E [Y 1 ]. Overflow can occur when P (Y 1 &gt; c) &gt; 0.

As demonstrated in <ref> [14] </ref>, this added numerical complexity greatly improves the accuracy of the approximation. Heterogeneous Sources The above result can be extended to mixture of different types of sources. Suppose there are N independent virtual circuits of M types.

Reference-contexts: This is particularly true for real-time traffic involving video and voice. One potential solution to this problem is to accept the call based on an initial estimate of the statistics, and then refine the resource allocation dynamically based on information collected on-line. We explore this idea in <ref> [15] </ref>. In this section we address this issue with another approach by examining the feasibility of carrying out admission control based on only a few parameters from the new call.

Reference-contexts: We should also point out that effective bandwidth is an asymptotic result. When we have a heterogeneous mixing of sources that evolve at different time scales, the linear relation in eq. 5 may underestimate the required bandwidth, as illustrated in the numerical examples in <ref> [21] </ref>. When we multiplex Markov modulated sources with different time scales, the resulting aggregate can be viewed as a single Markov modulated source consisting of component sub-chains, where transitions among the sub-chains occur at much lower rates than transitions within the sub-chains.

Reference-contexts: If the instantaneous rate of class k exceeds C k , the overflown cells are dropped. Note that one may achieve a larger call acceptance region for the real-time connections through schemes such as Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) <ref> [22] </ref>, which allows the assigned bandwidth for one class to be used by others when it is idle. However, this improvement is obtained at the cost of a more complex implementation. Thus we will use a simple partitioning where unused capacity will be given to non-real-time and best-effort traffic.
