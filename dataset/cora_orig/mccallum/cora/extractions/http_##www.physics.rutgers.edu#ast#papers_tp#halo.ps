Abstract: Dwarf galaxies might be destroyed either by internal processes, such as gas loss induced by star formation, or external processes, such as tidal disruption. It is hard to see how gas loss or stellar mass loss can disrupt a galaxy dominated by dark matter. Recent modeling of the tidal destruction of dwarf spheroidal galaxies around the Milky Way has concentrated on what the dwarf would look like during the destruction. A velocity gradient across the galaxy that is larger than the velocity dispersion is the clearest signature. The lack of such gradients in all of the local dwarf spheroidal galaxies except Sagittarius means that these galaxies are not being significantly affected by tides and that tides cannot explain their large measured mass-to-light ratios. Sagittarius probably is being destroyed by tides today and models of tidal destruction are being applied to interpret the observations of this galaxy.
