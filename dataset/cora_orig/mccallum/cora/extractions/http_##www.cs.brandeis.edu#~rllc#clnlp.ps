Reference-contexts: On the other hand we have extended Van der Sandt's algorithm with Bridging, and thus made it more complete with respect to the linguistic data. The work presented here is limited to definite descriptions; we have not looked into other presupposition triggers. <ref> [ Beaver, 1993 ] </ref> mentions the following examples, where inferencing takes place. (9) Probably, if Jane takes a bath, Bill will be annoyed that there is no more hot water. (10) If Spaceman Spiff lands on Planet X, he will be bothered by the fact that his weight is higher than

Reference-contexts: K 1 ( v. (K 2 (v)(~))) iff K 1 is of type &lt; ff,t&gt; and v is of type ff; = K 1 fi K 3 (where K 3 2 tc (K 2 )) otherwise. Clause one is like the functional composition rule (in <ref> [ Bos et al., 1994 ] </ref> ). This rule has the nice property that it doesn't need type-shifting of arguments. It always binds the first argument position of the argument, and has functional application as a special case (~ is empty then).

Reference-contexts: This rule has the nice property that it doesn't need type-shifting of arguments. It always binds the first argument position of the argument, and has functional application as a special case (~ is empty then). The second clause does the type coercion stuff (cf. <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1993 ] </ref> ): Definition 12. Type Coercion (TC). tc (K)=f K 0 fi K j K 0 2 qa (K) g Definition 13.

Reference-contexts: Proper names do not have qualia structure (see footnote earlier). john : P. ff: john (x) P (x) 8 <ref> [ Pustejovsky, 1995 ] </ref> assumes qualia structures for all categories. 12 The verbs write and read introduce event-types.
