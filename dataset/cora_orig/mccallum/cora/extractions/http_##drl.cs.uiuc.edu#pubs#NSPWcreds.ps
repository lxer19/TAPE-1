Title: Credentials for Privacy and Interoperation  
Author: V. E. Jones N. Ching M. Winslett

Abstract: We consider the problem of providing secure, private access to applications and data in a world-wide distributed client-server environment such as the Internet of the future. In such a system, the set of potential users of a service may extend far beyond the local community knowable to the application providing the service. Applications will not generally have prior knowledge of the individual making a request upon which an access control decision can be based and furthermore, knowledge of an individual's identity may not be directly useful. We frame our discussion in the context of supporting credentials which are submitted with a request, and propose a list of desiderata for such credentials. We evaluate several well-known proposals for credentials, focusing on issues related to privacy and scalability, and then point out the research issues that remain before such schemes can be deployed in a world-wide environment with strong privacy guarantees.

Reference-contexts: More realistically, this information might be partitioned among multiple authorities (e.g., as suggested in existing authorization frameworks such as X.509 <ref> [2] </ref>), but then processing a request for service may require several extra messages in order to consult the relevant databases to determine the appropriate access. This will often result in unacceptable response times for an interactive session and significant extra network load. <p> The potential for extensions to increase expressivity and extensibility also exists even though the current design is limited to identity. 3.4 X.509 Authentication Framework The certificates specified in CCITT X.509 <ref> [2] </ref> are a kind of identity credential, one which binds a name to a cryptographic key (a public key).
