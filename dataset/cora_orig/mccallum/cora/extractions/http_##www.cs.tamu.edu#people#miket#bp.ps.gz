Abstract: This study briefly overviews the major research results concerning the analysis and derivations of solutions for the Busy Period of the GI=M=1 Queuing System. The Busy Period of GI=M=1 systems has not been investigate as intensely as other quantities, such as, the queue length process or the queuing times, of this and other queuing systems. We overview solution methodologies proposed by Conolly and Takacs. Conolly presented difference equation methods and Takacs used a combinatorial technique to derive the probability distribution of the busy period at the steady state.

Reference-contexts: His arguments attracted the attention and they had important consequences for the future developments in queuing theory. Based on Bailey's methodology, Conolly (1957) has done a series of reseach studies for single server queuing process and derived the Difference Equations Method. In his paper (Conolly, 1958) <ref> [5] </ref> this method was applied to M=M=1 queue. Conolly (1958) [6] generalized this technique to =GI=M=1 queue. His method seems to economize in algebra compared to Bailey's method. Takacs (1961) introduced the Combinatorial method for the study of the GI=M=1 and the M=G=1 queues. <p> W. Conolly in 1958 in connection with the study of single server queuing systems. Conolly introduced this method in <ref> [5] </ref> as a way to simplify the mathematical derivation of the time-dependent solution of the queue length probability distribution. <p> To achieve this objective we will simultaneously investigate the BP duration in terms of time and number of people served. The basic derivation methodology utilizes the (integro) difference equation technique presented by Conolly in 1958, <ref> [5] </ref>.
