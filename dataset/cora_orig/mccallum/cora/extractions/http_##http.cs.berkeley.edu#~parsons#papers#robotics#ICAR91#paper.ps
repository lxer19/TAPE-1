Title: A Retraction Method for Motion Coordination  
Author: David Parsons John Canny 
Address: Berkeley, CA 94720  
Affiliation: Computer Science Division Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences University of California  
Abstract: We present an algorithm for planning coordinated motions of a pair of convex polygonal mobile robots moving in a shared two-dimensional workspace which contains polygonal obstacles. The algorithm uses a generalized Voronoi diagram as a skeleton of the workspace and searches for paths for which the robots remain on this skeleton except in certain regions which have high clearance from the obstacles.

Reference-contexts: Very often the subset V of FP used in retraction algorithms is (a subset of) the Voronoi diagram of the obstacle set, or an appropriate generalization thereof. For our purposes, the most important example of such a generalized Voronoi diagram is the B-Voronoi diagram presented in <ref> [LS87] </ref>. The application in that paper is in planning translational motions for a single convex polygon moving amidst polygonal obstacles. Voronoi diagrams, when applicable, have many attractive properties for motion planning. For example, paths which lie on Voronoi diagrams maximize the clearance of the robot as it passes between obstacles. <p> The next few subsections make these ideas more precise. 2.1 B-Voronoi diagrams A number of definitions are now necessary for describing the B-Voronoi diagram of a set of obstacles. Our notation is adapted from that of <ref> [LS87] </ref>. Let B denote any compact convex two-dimensional body with nonempty interior, and let O be a fixed interior point of B. We denote by B 0 the set of points of the plane occupied by B when the reference point O is at the origin. <p> We refer the reader to <ref> [LS87] </ref> for a detailed statement of the relevant general position assumptions; here we simply note that they allow us to assume that any point in F (S) will have a unique B-closest point on any particular obstacle in S, and that no more than 3 B-Voronoi cells can intersect at any <p> Another useful definition is that of the clearance of a point p 2 F (S), denoted Cl B (p; S), which is defined as the B-distance from the point p to a point in Near B (p; S). In <ref> [LS87] </ref>, Leven and Sharir prove many useful properties of this generalized Voronoi diagram, and they describe an optimal algorithm for its construction based on an algorithm due to Yap ([Yap87a]). <p> of the next subsection. 2.2 Getting onto the diagram In order to move the pair of robots from an arbitrary legal configuration to a legal configuration in which both robots lie on the Voronoi diagram, we make use of the retraction function r () defined for the one-robot problem in <ref> [LS87] </ref>. We begin this section by defining this retraction and an associated vector field 4, and then we state an important "divergence" property of this vector field which will allow us to apply the retraction safely to get both robots onto the diagram. <p> We have found neither a convincing proof of completeness nor a counter-example. However we believe it is plausible that the algorithm is complete, due to certain characteristics of the Voronoi diagram and of the clearance function. We wish to briefly mention this evidence here. To begin with, <ref> [LS87] </ref> proved that in the case of 1 robot, searching in the Voronoi diagram yields a complete motion planning algorithm.

This definition is exactly analogous to the definition of the standard Voronoi diagram for a set of objects in the plane; see e.g. <ref> [OY85] </ref>. The difference lies in the use of d B as the distance function underlying the diagram. This has the important consequence that in the case that B is a polygon, the resulting diagram is composed of straight line segments only.

Reference-contexts: the robots don't collide with any obstacles in the environment nor with each other. (Thus we have a purely holonomic problem; it is assumed that the robots are capable of moving arbitrarily in any direction in the plane from any location.) A complete solution to this problem is presented in <ref> [PC90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: These assumptions 4 do not restrict the domain of applicability of the algorithm in any serious way, since a problem instance in which the obstacles are not in general position may be transformed into one in which they are by the method of "infinitisimal perturbations" (see <ref> [SS83] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: An interesting related work to the present paper is <ref> [Yap84] </ref>, which gives an algorithm for planning coordinated motions for 2 or 3 discs moving in the plane. That algorithm is also based on the retraction approach; however the range of the retraction function used is not a generalization of a Voronoi diagram.
