Abstract: We propose a statistical model for signature verification by computer. Our model recognizes that repeated signatures by the "owner" are similar but not identical. Our model consists of a template signature for each individual, and several factors which allow for variations in each rendition of this template. These variations include the speed of writing, as well as slowly varying affine transformations such as size, rotation and shear. The estimated template represents the "mean" of a sample of signatures from an individual, and the variations in the factors can be used to establish several measures of "variance". These quantitative measures are essential for reliable signature verification.

Reference-contexts: Our model uses DTW to match the speed signals of two signatures. We do not believe, however, that DTW should be used to compensate for other variations between signatures (such as Euclidean shape transformations). In <ref> [H 78] </ref> and [Y 77] DTW was used to match the (X t ; Y t ) co-ordinates of two signatures. In doing so they introduced nonlinear distortions in the time domain to compensate for rotation, scaling and shear which are linear transformations in the X; Y domain. <p> A better correspondence may also be achieved due to the fact that both signals are being simultaneously adjusted to fit each other in the symmetric case. Dynamic time warping has already been used in a limited capacity in signature verification systems ( <ref> [H 78] </ref> and [Y 77]), to match the X (t) and Y (t) signals. The results of these algorithms were less than satisfactory (see [PS 89]), due to the fact that the X (t) and Y (t) representation of the signature is not invariant under rotation and scaling.

Reference-contexts: Figure 5 shows the results of such a matching. In practice the curvature signal tends to be numerically unstable because 12 first five signatures of Suresh Goyal (taken from <ref> [N 91] </ref>). it is based on second derivative information, despite the fact that it is derived from the smoothed signature curves. This is specially true around points of high curvature, which are the areas of interest for segmentation. <p> But from (8) we see that since the numerator is precisely this normal acceleration, this implies X (t) / 1=V 2 X (t). This argument is presented in more detail in <ref> [N 91] </ref>. Of course real signatures do not behave exactly in the manner idealized here. Our model (2) allows other deformations besides rotation and global scaling, and allows them to vary with u as well.

Reference-contexts: There is a vast amount of literature in differential geometry and computer vision that deals with the problems of shape similarities under different transformations, such as projections, perspective and affine transformations. However, in the signature verification literature this problem has received hardly any attention ([S 82], <ref> [P 87] </ref>). Our model represents each of several renditions of an individuals signature by a single template, together with an individual part that describes 3 deviations from the template.

Reference-contexts: In [CO 83] a sequence of 44 different features are used, derived from 3 signals generated by a force-sensitive pen. Some papers have also applied specific transformations to the signals and then used as features a truncated set of coefficients from these transformations. For example, <ref> [ZV 85] </ref> used the first 40 low-frequency coefficients of the power spectra obtained using a Walsh transform. At first it seems very attractive to reduce the task of signature verification to the two steps of low-level feature detection, followed by some standard method of feature-vector comparison.
