Reference-contexts: Since control action is easily de ducible from workpiece roughness, the subproblem of workpiece roughness estimation was addressed first. Several machine learning techniques were already ap plied to the problem, yielding encouraging results <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.1 Experiments Data were obtained during an experiment in which vibration signals generated by the grinding wheel and the workpiece were detected by an accelerometer sen sor and processed by a spectrum analyser [2].

Reference-contexts: Several machine learning techniques were already ap plied to the problem, yielding encouraging results [1]. 3.1 Experiments Data were obtained during an experiment in which vibration signals generated by the grinding wheel and the workpiece were detected by an accelerometer sen sor and processed by a spectrum analyser <ref> [2] </ref>. From the obtained spectra predefined spectral features were extracted: total spectrum area (SpArea), frequency of the maximum area peak (MaxAreaX), and frequency of the spectrum area central point (AreaCX). Simultane ously, workpiece surface roughness was measured.

Reference-contexts: The problems were: determination of workpiece roughness during the process of steel grinding and modelling of the operator behavior during the process of electrical discharge machining. Fors (First Order Induction System, <ref> [3] </ref>) is an algorithm which induces concepts in first order logic, handles real-valued attributes, uses background knowledge, can detect linear relationships between examined attributes, models dynamic systems (i.e. learns from time series), partitions attribute space to sub-spaces to find a regressional submodel for each sub-space separately, and handles noisy data. 2 <p> partitions attribute space to sub-spaces to find a regressional submodel for each sub-space separately, and handles noisy data. 2 Fors Algorithm Since the emphasis of the paper is on the two applications, this section only shortly describes main characteristics of Fors, while additional information about Fors can be found in <ref> [3] </ref>. We describe algorithm's input and some of its features that were employed during the work described in this paper. Input to the algorithm consists of learning examples and background knowledge. Examples are described with variables, which can be discrete, continuous or arbitrary Prolog terms.
