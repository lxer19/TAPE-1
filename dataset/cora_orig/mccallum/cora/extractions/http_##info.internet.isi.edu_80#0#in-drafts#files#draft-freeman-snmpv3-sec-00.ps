Abstract: This document presents simpler and more secure architectures for SNMPv3 agents than the ones specified in RFCs 2271-2275. Agent security is improved by restricting each module's access to data, using the "principle of least privilege". The new agent architectures are analyzed in terms of software complexity as well as security, and are shown in some respects to be simpler. This document is being submitted to the IETF Simple Network Management Protocol version 3 (SNMPv3) Working Group for consideration as potential security architectures for SNMPv3. Comments are solicited and should be addressed to the authors and/or the SNMPv3 working group mailing list at snmpv3@tis.com. Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months. Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "working draft" or "work in progress."
