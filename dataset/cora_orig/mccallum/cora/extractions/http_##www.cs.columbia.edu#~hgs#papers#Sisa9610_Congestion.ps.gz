Abstract: In previous work, we proposed to enhance TCP's congestion control mechanisms using binary congestion notification (BCN). With this combined scheme called BCN-TCP, congestion is indicated both by packet losses and by having switches inform sources about their congestion state by setting a congestion bit. Unlike other studies, our approach maintains the basic elements of TCP's congestion control mechanisms and models the response of TCP to the congestion bit to that of the ATM available bit rate service (ABR). We compared the performance of BCN-TCP to the versions currently implemented in hosts (Tahoe and Reno TCP). However, BCN-TCP only offered significant performance improvements if part of the path contained ATM ABR services. In this paper, we present further results on the performance of BCN-TCP when used in heterogeneous environments, i.e., Internet paths where only some end systems support BCN-TCP. We also consider the fairness between long and short-haul connections and discover that BCN-TCP treats long-haul connections worse than Tahoe and Reno TCP. We investigate the cause of this unfairness and suggest possible remedies.

Reference-contexts: Tahoe, reduce the transmission window to only one packet. The retransmission and severe window reduction actions taken in TCP after detecting a loss lead to the waste of bandwidth and underutilisation. To overcome this drawback we introduced in previous work <ref> [1] </ref> an enhanced version of TCP that uses binary congestion notification (BCN) for congestion indication. In contrast to other approaches, our scheme maintains the basic TCP behaviour and adapts TCP's response to BCN based upon the source behaviour proposed for connections using ATM's available bit rate (ABR) service. <p> This proposal still needs further development and testing. The author does not give any explanation for choosing the decrease factor of 0.625 or the way this multiplicative decrease can be integrated with TCP's congestion control mechanisms. 2.3.2 Our Proposal for Binary Congestion Control in TCP In a previous paper <ref> [1] </ref>, we described the usage of binary congestion notification in TCP. With this enhanced model, IP packets could have a congestion bit either as an additional option or directly in the header. Packets are sent with the congestion bit set to 0, i.e, not congested. <p> If three duplicate acks were received and the source was not in the binary congestion notification mode normal TCP action are taken, i.e, retransmission and window reduction. For detailed description of the implementation of BCN-TCP, see <ref> [1] </ref>. In this, the scheme resembles the congestion control schemes using bit marking proposed for ATM data services [12]. <p> Also, handling congestion in advance reduces the amount of buffer required in the intermediate switches and the delay caused by retransmis-sions. 3 Introducing BCN-TCP in a Heterogeneous Environment Using different simulation models we investigated in <ref> [1] </ref> the performance of BCN-TCP compared to Tahoe-TCP and Reno-TCP. Our results revealed that, just as was the case for the model proposed by Sally Floyd in [9], the increase in throughput performance was marginal when compared with Tahoe-TCP or Reno-TCP. <p> The packet size was set here to 500 bytes. The multiplicative decrease factor was set to 0.975. This value yielded the best results in the simulations we made in <ref> [1] </ref>. Values smaller than 0.975 resulted in large window reductions and low link utilisation. Using larger values resulted, on the other hand, in slow reactions to congestion and packet losses. The switch is a random early drop (RED) gateway as proposed by Floyd and Jacobson [16]. <p> However, the relation between the number of passed hops and the value of multiplicative reduction factor needs further investigations. Reno and BCN-TCP 5 Summary and Open Issues Building on previous work <ref> [1] </ref> we investigated the effects of using binary congestion control in TCP. Our results suggest that such a scheme, while being a good integration basis for TCP and ABR, suffers from some fairness problems. We have demonstrated some approaches for overcoming this problem but further investigations are still necessary.

Reference-contexts: Dropping only one cell in the ATM level results in the loss of a whole TCP packet. Thereby, even a small cell loss ratio results in a large data loss ratio in the TCP level <ref> [7] </ref>. In order to allow for a smooth integration of TCP and ATM, it might be profitable to benefit from the congestion control schemes proposed for ATM and to adapt the TCP congestion control mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Upon receiving a RM cell with CI set to congested, the source end system has to multiplicatively reduce its rate. Otherwise, it is entitled to increase its rate additively. 1 N is usually set to 32 <ref> [8] </ref> 2.3 Binary Congestion Control in TCP In TCP/IP based networks congestion is indicated by dropping packets at congested routers. Packets are dropped when the queue of the router reaches its limit (drop tail scheme). <p> Other than the random early drop scheme used during this study, there have been several proposals for switch algorithms for the ABR services, see <ref> [17, 8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The source then changes its transmission window in accordance with the value of the congestion bit. 2.3.1 Previous Proposals for Binary Congestion Con trol in TCP Probably the most important work done in the area of binary congestion notification in TCP was done by Sally Floyd <ref> [9] </ref>. In her paper [9], she proposes guidelines for TCP's response to binary congestion notification (BCN) that can be sum-marised as follows: 1. TCP's response to BCN should be similar over longer time scales to its response to dropped packets or time outs. 2. <p> The source then changes its transmission window in accordance with the value of the congestion bit. 2.3.1 Previous Proposals for Binary Congestion Con trol in TCP Probably the most important work done in the area of binary congestion notification in TCP was done by Sally Floyd <ref> [9] </ref>.

TCP's response to BCN should be similar over longer time scales to its response to dropped packets or time outs. 2. <p> TCP should react to BCN at most once per round trip time. 4. The response to BCN does not trigger the sending or retransmitting of any data packets. For the simulations done using this approach TCP was modified as follows <ref> [9] </ref>: Upon receiving a BCN message and if no response to congestion had been made in the last round trip time the usual congestion control mechanisms are applied, however, without retransmitting any data. <p> Our results revealed that, just as was the case for the model proposed by Sally Floyd in <ref> [9] </ref>, the increase in throughput performance was marginal when compared with Tahoe-TCP or Reno-TCP. However, a noticeable gain in performance was seen when integrating BCN-TCP with ABR. Using TCP over ABR leads in general to multiple packet losses. This results especially for Reno-TCP in severe performance degradation.
