Abstract: where A; B; C are respectively n fi n, n fi m, r fi n ma-trices. Assume that system (22) is asymptotically observable (that is, it is detectable). Our main result for input/output systems is as follows: observable and A is stable. Then there exist an m fi n matrix F and an n fi r matrix L such that the following property holds. Let 1 p 1. Pick any u 1 2 L p ([0; 1); IR m ) and u 2 2 L p ([0; 1); IR r ), and consider the solution x = (x 1 ; x 2 ) of (23) with x(0) = 0. Consider the total output function y = (y 1 ; y 2 ) = (Cx 1 ; F x 2 ). Then y is in L p ([0; 1); IR r+m ) and kyk L p K(ku 1 k L p + ku 2 k L p ) for some constant K. PROOF: We will show a somewhat stronger statement, namely, that the state trajectory x also satisfies such an estimate. The proof will be the usual Luenberger-observer construction, but a bit of care has to be taken because of the nonlinearities. Since A + LC is Hurwitz and is globally Lipschitz (this property is essential here), we know that e is in L p ([0; 1); IR n ) and kek L p K 1 (ku 1 k L p + ku 2 k L p ) for some constant K 1 . Then the conclusion follows from Theorem 1. Note that the conclusion of this Theorem can be restated in terms of the finite gain stability of a standard systems interconnection y 1 = P (u 1 +y 2 ); y 2 = C(u 2 +y 1 ) where P denotes the input/output behavior of the original system and C is the input/output behavior of the controller with state space x 2 and output y 2 . The main result, Theorem 1, can be restated as follows. For each fixed p and , we can introduce the operator (more precisely, we should write " ;p ") which associates to any element of L p ([0; 1); IR m ) the solution of (2). Thus, we have proved that for each 1 p 1, the operator is everywhere defined and bounded (that is, "finite gain"). (We also computed an estimate of the operator norm, and compared this estimate to that which would obtain from applying the same feedback to the corresponding system without saturation.) It is natural to ask about further regularity properties of the operators , such as continuity (which is stronger than merely asking for the operator to be bounded), or even Lipschitz continuity (that is, "finite incremental gain"). Here there are some surprises, which can be summarized as follows. may fail to be continuous, unless additional properties are required of . (For instance, continuity fails for the standard saturation 0 , but it does hold for any which is continuously differentiable and has an everywhere positive derivative.) Lipschitz continuity fails always, for both finite and infinite p. In fact, not even an extremely weak "generalized incremental gain" estimate k(v) (u)k g(kv uk) ; with g a function of class K, holds in general. Details of these facts are provided in the full-length version of this paper; many more results along these lines are currently being explored. Regarding connections to abstract notions of dissipation, as we have pointed out in Remark 6, the proof of Theorem 1 can easily be rewritten so as to establish a dissipation inequality. The storage functions needed are nonstandard; for instance, when establishing L 2 stability one needs a storage function of degree three.
