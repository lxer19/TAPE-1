Abstract: We study the complexity of second-order indefinite elliptic problems div(aru) + bu = f (with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions) over a d-dimensional domain , the error being measured in the H 1 ()-norm. The problem elements f belong to the unit ball of W r;p (), where p 2 [2; 1] and r &gt; d=p. Information consists of (possibly-adaptive) noisy evaluations of f, a, or b (or their derivatives). The absolute error in each noisy evaluation is at most ffi. We find that the nth minimal radius for this problem is proportional to n r=d + ffi, and that a noisy finite element method with quadrature (FEMQ), which uses only function values, and not derivatives, is a minimal error algorithm. This noisy FEMQ can be efficiently implemented using multigrid techniques. Using these results, we find tight bounds on the "-complexity (minimal cost of calculating an "-approximation) for this problem, said bounds depending on the cost c(ffi) of calculating a ffi-noisy information value. As an example, if the cost of a ffi-noisy evaluation is c(ffi) = ffi s (for s &gt; 0), then the complexity is proportional to (1=") d=r+s .

Reference-contexts: The main difference is that we are not able to use a smoothing operator based on the discretized partial differential operator (DPDO) given by the coefficients a and b, since this operator is not positive definite. Rather, we follow the lead of <ref> [3] </ref>, and use a smoothing operator based on the DPDO given by the coefficients a and 1. Although most of the details of the algorithm are the same as in [13], we give a complete description for the convenience of the reader. <p> This multigrid method is similar to that in our previous paper [13], the difference being that we use the inner multigrid step of <ref> [3] </ref> (which has been crafted to work with indefinite problems). Nonetheless, we give a complete description of the method, to help keep this paper reasonably self-contained. As in [13], we use the notation of [4, Chapter 6].

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, we give a complete description of the method, to help keep this paper reasonably self-contained. As in [13], we use the notation of <ref> [4, Chapter 6] </ref>. Recall that fT n g 1 n=1 is a quasi-uniform grid sequence. Let us write h j = max h K for the meshsize of T j . Recall (from Theorem 4.1) that the noisy FEMQ ~ n;ffi is well-defined if n n flfl . <p> Note that ^ B a is a uniformly strongly coercive bilinear form on H 1 0 (), as are the forms ^ B a;b;n j ;ffi for 1 j l. Following the proof of <ref> [4, Lemma 6.2.8] </ref>, we obtain an upper bound ( ^ A j ) fl j = Ch 2 on the spectral radius of ^ A j , where the constant C is independent of the index j and the coefficient vector (a; b).

Reference-contexts: The Noisy FEMQ In this section, we define the noisy finite element method with quadrature (FEMQ). This is an algorithm using standard information consisting only of function evaluations, i.e., no derivative evaluations are used. Our notation is the standard one found in, e.g., <ref> [5] </ref> and [12, Chapter 5]. This noisy FEMQ is the same as described in [13]. However, we will give a complete description of the noisy FEMQ, so that this paper can be reasonably self-contained. We first establish some notation. Let ^ K be a fixed polyhedron in R d .

Reference-contexts: The problem is said to be indefinite if we no longer can assume that the function b is non-negative. Indefinite elliptic problems arise in inverse acoustic scattering theory, in which the Helmholtz problem u + u = f plays an important role (see, e.g., <ref> [6] </ref>). Here, the only restriction on is that it not be an eigenvalue of the Laplacian. Thus, the Helmholtz problem is indefinite. In this paper, we extend the results of [13] to a class of indefinite elliptic problems. Our main result may be described as follows.

Reference-contexts: Now for any (a; b) 2 A , the bilinear form is weakly coercive, symmetric, and bounded (see, e.g., [12, Section 5.2]; a "uniform" proof, independent of (a; b) 2 A , is given in Section 4 of this paper). Using the generalized Lax-Milgram Lemma ([1, pg. 112], <ref> [8, pg. 310] </ref>), it follows that for any [f ; a; b] 2 F , there exists a unique solution u 2 H 1 0 () to (2.2), and so the solution operator S is well-defined. We wish to calculate approximate solutions to this problem, using noisy standard information.

Reference-contexts: What can we say about the complexity of such problems? The systematic study of complexity for problems with noisy information was initiated by <ref> [9] </ref>, with noisy elliptic problems first being investigated in [13]. Let us recall the main results of [13]. <p> We wish to calculate approximate solutions to this problem, using noisy standard information. To be specific, we will be using uniformly sup-norm-bounded noise. Our notation and terminology is essentially that of <ref> [9] </ref>, although we sometimes use modifications found in [10]. Let ffi 2 [0; 1] be a noise level . <p> An optimal error algorithm using nth optimal information is said to be an nth minimal error algorithm. Next, we describe our model of computation. We will use the model found in <ref> [9, Section 2.9] </ref>. Here are the most important features of this model: (1) For any multi-index , any point x 2 , and any function v defined on , the cost of calculating a ffi-noisy value of (D v)(x) is c (ffi).

Reference-contexts: However, the results of this paper also hold if error is measured in the L 2 -norm. Typically, we only know the values of a, b, and f at a finite number of points in . Hence, this is a problem of information-based complexity (IBC) <ref> [11] </ref>. We cannot obtain exact solutions with finite cost; we must settle for an "-approximation, i.e., an algorithm computing (for each choice of a, b, and f ) an approximation whose error is at most ".

Reference-contexts: Most earlier work on the complexity of elliptic problems has assumed that exact information is available, i.e., we calculate the values these coefficient functions or of the right-hand side exactly. (An extensive treatment of the topic may be found in <ref> [12] </ref>.) What happens if the information is contaminated by noise? Suppose that we can only guarantee that these calculated function values are accurate to within some positive noise level ffi. <p> Acknowledgements : I would like to thank J. B. Altzman for his comments on this paper. 2. Problem Description In what follows, we assume that the reader is familiar with the usual terminology and notations arising in the variational study of elliptic boundary value problems, including Sobolev spaces. See <ref> [12, Chapter 5 and Appendix] </ref> for further details, as well as the references cited there. <p> Now for any (a; b) 2 A , the bilinear form is weakly coercive, symmetric, and bounded (see, e.g., <ref> [12, Section 5.2] </ref>; a "uniform" proof, independent of (a; b) 2 A , is given in Section 4 of this paper). <p> The Noisy FEMQ In this section, we define the noisy finite element method with quadrature (FEMQ). This is an algorithm using standard information consisting only of function evaluations, i.e., no derivative evaluations are used. Our notation is the standard one found in, e.g., [5] and <ref> [12, Chapter 5] </ref>. This noisy FEMQ is the same as described in [13]. However, we will give a complete description of the noisy FEMQ, so that this paper can be reasonably self-contained. We first establish some notation. Let ^ K be a fixed polyhedron in R d . <p> Following <ref> [12, Lemmas 5.2.1 and 5.4.4] </ref>, we find that w is nonzero and that B a;b (v; w) 1 + 0 + C 1 0 (n fl ) =d kvk H 1 () kwk H 1 () : Hence the problem is uniform weakly coercive. fl Our main tool is Strang's Lemma <p> 5.2.1 and 5.4.4], we find that w is nonzero and that B a;b (v; w) 1 + 0 + C 1 0 (n fl ) =d kvk H 1 () kwk H 1 () : Hence the problem is uniform weakly coercive. fl Our main tool is Strang's Lemma (see <ref> [12, pp. 310-312] </ref> for a proof of a version having slightly more restrictive hypotheses). 10 Lemma 4.2. <p> Furthermore, there exists a constant C such that e ( ~ n;ffi ; ~ N n;ffi ) C (n =d + ffi); where = minfk; rg: Proof: We first show that ~ n;ffi is well-defined. As in <ref> [12, pg. 106] </ref>, there exists a positive constant C such that jB a;b (v; w) B a;b;~n (v; w)j Cn -=d kvk H 1 () kwk H 1 () 8 v; w 2 S ~n for any n 2 Z ++ . <p> We now turn to the error of the FEMQ. Let ffi 2 [0; ffi 0 ] and n n flfl . For [f ; a; b] 2 F , let u = S ([f ; a; b]). From <ref> [12, pg. 107] </ref>, there exists v 2 S ~n such that ku vk H 1 () Cn =d kf k H r () Cn =d ; (4.9) the latter since there exists a positive constant C for which kf k H r () Ckf k W r;p () C: (4.10) Now <p> ku vk H 1 () Cn =d kf k H r () Cn =d ; (4.9) the latter since there exists a positive constant C for which kf k H r () Ckf k W r;p () C: (4.10) Now for any w 2 S ~n , we find from <ref> [12, pg. 106] </ref> that jf (w) f ~n (w)j Cn -=d kf k H r () kwk H 1 () Cn -=d kwk H 1 () ; where we have again used (4.10). <p> n j , then we get the standard finite element basis fs 1 ; : : :; s n j g for S n j by requiring that s i (p i 0 ) = ffi i;i 0 for 1 i; i 0 n j (see, e.g., the discussion in <ref> [12, Sections 5.7 and A.2.3] </ref>).
