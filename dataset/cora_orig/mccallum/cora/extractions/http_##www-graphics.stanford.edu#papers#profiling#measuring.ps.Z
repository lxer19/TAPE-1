Note: Most X connections are either local (no network involved), or over an ethernet connection using TCP/IP [16, 14] and Berkeley sockets. Both of these environments usually provide adequate bandwidth for X [6]. However, X is also used in environments where Funded by an AT&T PhD fellowship and a generous grant from Apple Computer

Abstract: This paper describes a system for tracing the X Window System Protocol. We have analyzed these traces by breaking the protocol down into discrete instructions or messages, and analyzing the frequency and network resource requirements of these messages. This analysis has resulted in preliminary results in 4 areas: the relative importance of X messages, how X usage changes during different application stages, differing application idioms for accomplishing similar tasks, and the size distributions of X messages and groups of X messages. Some of these results have architectural implications for network protocols and implementations. Window systems are a major system component of modern operating systems. With windows, a user can display multiple work sessions at once on a single computer display. One of the most powerful attributes a window system can have is network transparency. With a network transparent window system, the user can run window programs on any machine on the network, interacting with them as if they were local. The most widespread network transparent window system is the X Window System version 11 [7], commonly known as X11 or just X. The part of X that runs on the machine in front of the user is known as the X server. The X server draws on the display and handles input devices such as the mouse and the keyboard. The user programs that connect to the X server are called clients. Probably the most commonly run X client is xterm, the X terminal emulator. Other popular clients include clocks, text editors (WYSIWYG and otherwise), and drawing programs.
