Abstract: The algorithm presented in this paper has three major benefits: it does not need to compute RTT from all receivers to the source, does not require knowledge of group membership, and provides prompt feedback. A small set of representative receivers and probabilistic suppression are used to limit feedback. We believe that this approach will perform well in real networks. Simulations show that for various multicast group sizes, a few representatives can keep the amount of feedback low while not degrading feedback timeliness.

Reference-contexts: In addition to evaluating the use of packet loss as a congestion metric as is done in traditional TCP, we would also like to investigate delay-based metrics like that used in TCP-Vegas <ref> [2] </ref>. 7 Conclusion This paper described a multicast feedback control scheme that is part of our efforts to build a scalable reliable, flow-controlled, multicast transport protocol suitable for bulk data transfer applications.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction While many existing multicast transport protocols such as SRM [5], and RTP [11], target delay sensitive, real-time applications, little has been done to address congestion issues that arise in multipoint bulk data transfer services. The feedback suppression scheme presented addresses the problem of feedback implosion <ref> [3] </ref>, while providing frequent and timely feedback required for congestion control, yet not requiring full knowledge of the multicast group membership nor special support from the network. Feedback implosion occurs when a multitude of receivers respond to a single event such as a packet loss.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction While many existing multicast transport protocols such as SRM <ref> [5] </ref>, and RTP [11], target delay sensitive, real-time applications, little has been done to address congestion issues that arise in multipoint bulk data transfer services. <p> Feedback implosion occurs when a multitude of receivers respond to a single event such as a packet loss. This flood of responses can rapidly congest the network. Several existing reliable multicast transport protocols <ref> [5] </ref> use RTT-based probabilistic suppression to avoid feedback implosion. Each receiver measures RTT to the source and sets a timer based on its distance from the source. Receivers nearer the source will respond more quickly and will suppress feedback from receivers farther down the multicast tree. <p> Timer-based solutions rely on probabilistic feedback suppression to avoid implosion at the source. Receivers in the SRM protocol <ref> [5] </ref> (designed to support the WB distributed whiteboard application) delay their retransmission requests for a random interval, uniformly distributed between the current time and the one-way trip time to the source. <p> This criteria is based on the assumption that a representative that has not sent a NACK is having the fewest number of congestion problems. Timers Avoiding computation of RTT between all receivers and the source means we cannot use "precise" suppression timers as done in SRM <ref> [5] </ref>. We compensate by using loose timers and representatives to provide fast feedback. Since representatives provide immediate feedback on behalf of the subtrees they cover, we need "backup" timers for those losses not covered by representatives. We break our suppression timers into two components.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, most reliable multipoint transport protocols employ receiver-initiated or hybrid approaches to reliablity. However, receiver-based protocols also suffer from the feedback implosion problem, especially when losses occur high in the multicast tree in large groups. Grossglauser <ref> [6] </ref>, classfies solutions to the feedback implosion problem as structure-based or timer-based. Structure-based approaches, such as the Log-Based Protocol [8], rely on a designated site (either a dedicated server in the case of the Log-Based Protocol [8] or a pre-assigned group member) to process and filter feedback information. <p> The goal is that group members closer to the source send their feedback sooner suppressing feedback from farther away members. A site uses periodic session messages to measure its distance (based on the resulting RTT) to the other group members. The Deterministic Timeouts for Reliable Multicast (DTRM) <ref> [6] </ref> algorithm also uses RTT between receivers and the sender to compute the receivers' suppression timeouts such that only one receiver in a mul-ticast subtree, the representative receiver, responds to losses. The feedback control mechanism proposed in [9] does not fall into either the structure-based or the timer-based categories.

Reference-contexts: While such networks were easy to generate and provided useful preliminary information on the feedback suppression mechanism, it was necessary to test the feedback suppression mechanism on more realistic networks. To generate more realistic topologies we use Network Topology Generator <ref> [7] </ref>. The networks generated were three level networks with low delay links at the first and second levels and large delay links at the third level. <p> The intent is to provide a loose approximation of a real internetwork topology with a high speed backbone, slower regional networks and finally slow edge links. The loss rates were randomly chosen over the interval 0-5%. Hotz describes more details on the generation of the networks in <ref> [7] </ref>. The receivers are all at the third level and hence will tend to be leaves, but still have different distances to the source. The source is at the top level. 5.1.2 Simulator The simulator generates a minimum delay spanning tree from a given network topology.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, in the receiver-initiated approach to reliability, receivers detect packet losses and request retransmissions by generating NACKs. Placing the responsibility of recovering from packet losses on the receiver helps alleviate the ACK implosion problem. The performance comparison study presented in <ref> [10] </ref> confirms that receiver-initiated multicast transport protocols have better scalability propoerties than their sender-initiated counterparts. For this reason, most reliable multipoint transport protocols employ receiver-initiated or hybrid approaches to reliablity.
