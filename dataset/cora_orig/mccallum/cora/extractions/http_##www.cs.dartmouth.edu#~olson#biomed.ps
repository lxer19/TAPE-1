Abstract: An algorithm for recovering a function from essentially localized values of its Radon transform, and sparse non-local values was outlined in [12]. That algorithm utilized the time-frequency properties of wavelets, coupled with the range theorems for the Radon transform to essentially localize the dependence of the Radon transform. In this paper we utilize alternative time-frequency projections which were introduced by Coifman and Meyer in [4]. We present evidence that these bases are optimal according to our criterion for localized tomography. These bases require significantly less data than the wavelet bases which were used in [12]. Finally we present numerical results supporting this work.

Reference-contexts: Moreover we will view the Radon transform R f ( ~ ; t) as an element of either the weighted Chebyshev space L 2 (S 1 fi <ref> [1; 1] </ref>; dx fi (1 t 2 ) 1=2 dt) or as elements of L 2 with the usual inner product. <p> MS 94047, Rev. 1 5 Theorem 1 The Radon transform of a function f 2 L 2 (R), which is denoted by R f ( ~ ; t) 2 L 2 fi S 1 fi <ref> [1; 1] </ref> can be represented in the form R f ( ~ ; t) = (1 t 2 ) 1=2 l=0 where the T l (t) are Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, h l ( ~ ) = n2H l and H l = fl; l + 2:::l 2; lg. <p> Thus we want to use only one low frequency subspace, and one high frequency subspace. Decompositions such as the one outlined above can be accomplished by utilizing a properly constructed version of the local cosine projections of Coifman and Meyer <ref> [1] </ref>. We will now outline the construction of optimal projections, according to the range theorems of the Radon transform, and the constraints of the uncertainty principle. 5.3 High frequency computation Let us concentrate on the convolution involved in filtered backprojection. <p> Since this is below the resolution of a typical gray scale display, this is certainly acceptable. 10 Appendix: The Local Cosine and Sine Bases of Coifman and Meyer: Local sine and cosine bases where introduced in [4].

Reference-contexts: The Radon transform is now a mainstay of medical imaging as well as many other remote imaging sciences, such as electron microscopy. In two dimensions, however, the inversion, or reconstruction formula for the Radon transform is globally dependent upon the line integrals of the object function f <ref> [11] </ref>. In many situations, a physician may only be interested in images of a very local area of the body. One would prefer to expose only that local portion of the patient's body to radiation. <p> Although local values are not even uniquely determined by local integrals over hyperplanes, it has been proven that the elements which are not uniquely determined do not vary wildly on the interior of the region of interest <ref> [7, 10, 11] </ref>. While this is true, these results are asymptotic in nature, and don't really apply to a very localized region [12]. <p> This approach is well adapted for edge detection but it is not designed to recover the original density of the image. It has been noted that a rough estimate of the global properties of the Radon transform would be sufficient to obtain a reliable reconstruction of a local region <ref> [11] </ref>. This is the foundation for our algorithm. We reconstruct a low-resolution approximation to the global properties of the Radon transform through efficient sparse sampling. <p> We emphasize here that reconstruction of a density, from only the line integrals which pass through a restricted region of the density is not possible <ref> [11] </ref>, and therefore one must either regularize the reconstruction or gather more data. <p> For details and proofs, we recommend <ref> [11] </ref>. By S 1 we are simply referring to the one sphere or the unit circle, i.e. S 1 = f ~ = (cos ; sin )g; where we have abused the notation by referring to as the angle generated by ~ and the x-axis. <p> The operator R : f ! R f ( ~ ; ~ ~x) has been extensively studied in many contexts, and an excellent overview of the literature may be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. A detailed study of the singular value decomposition of the interior Radon transform, Eq. 3, can be found in [9, 10]. The results of [9, 10] confirm those in [11], and suggest that the problem of local reconstruction is not severely ill-conditioned, when the inversion is done modulo the nullspace. <p> ~ ~x) has been extensively studied in many contexts, and an excellent overview of the literature may be found in <ref> [11] </ref>.

The results of [9, 10] confirm those in [11], and suggest that the problem of local reconstruction is not severely ill-conditioned, when the inversion is done modulo the nullspace. <p> Once again, a detailed understanding of these spaces is not necessary to understand the algorithm of interest in this paper. 3.1.2 The Range of the Radon transform We will make use of the following theorem characterizing the range of the Radon transform, which can be found in <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> Thus the angular bandlimit in polar coordinates is tied to the radial variable s. The derivation of this result depends upon the fact that the Fourier transform of a weighted Chebyshev polynomial is a Bessel function <ref> [11] </ref>. The useful concept behind this Theorem is that if you have an object which is zero outside of a circle of radius 1, then the low frequency components can be completely determined from only a few sample points. <p> this setting the Fourier transform would be sampled on a radial grid and interpolation would be necessary in order to use a conventional fast Fourier transform based on a rectangular grid. 4.2 Filtered backprojection The most common alternative to Fourier reconstruction is the commonly used reconstruction method called filtered backprojection <ref> [11] </ref>. <p> Second, the window also represents a mollification of the inversion of the Radon transform, which is an unbounded operator without the addition of the window <ref> [11] </ref>. The reconstruction process is then relatively simple. First one filters the line integrals, at each angle, using the convolution filter generated by jsjw (s). Then one backprojects the result, as is illustrated in Figure 6. <p> The gathering of the additional non-local data would have made the algorithm useless, except for the fact that the range theorems for the Radon transform specify that the band-limits of the wavelet coefficients are essentially the same as the essential band-limits of the wavelets <ref> [11] </ref>. Thus non-local data only needs to be gathered from a few angles, and the coarse wavelet coefficients can then be interpolated at the other angles. 5.2 How many frequency windows? It has come to our attention that we did not need to use wavelets for the algorithm. <p> Since 12.5 percent of the data is truly local, it would seem difficult to reduce this number much further, especially since even Lambda reconstructions have to gather the additional "cushion" data around the central region. One possible reduction technique would involve the interlaced sampling technique <ref> [11] </ref>, although commercial utilization of this technique does not seem feasible. The second numerical example, Figure 12, illustrates the reconstruction of an off-center region of the Shepp-Logan phantom. This reconstruction centers the localized region about the three small lobes in the phantom, Once again 20% of the data was utilized. <p> When compared to conventional sampling, this algorithm reduces radiation exposure by 80% or more, when a localized region is to be imaged. We have demonstrated in [12] that an additional gain in minimization can be accomplished via the incorporation of interlaced sampling <ref> [11] </ref>. This could also be done with the algorithm presented here. This does not seem to be commercially viable, however, so its usefulness may be purely academic. Wavelet localized tomography [12] utilized interpolations at intermediate scales, which required that localized region of the image be centered, for reconstruction. <p> Z 1 R f (; r)T l (r)dr fi fi L 2 : Applying the Cauchy-Schwartz-Bunyakovskii inequality to Eq. 15 we get j ^ Rf ( ~ ; )j kR f (; r)k 2 1 X jJ l ()j 2 : (16) We need to use the Bessel function inequality <ref> [11, p.198] </ref> 0 jJ l (l)j (2l) 1=2 (1 2 ) 1=4 e (l=3)(1 2 ) 3=2 Since the above inequality becomes small only when &lt; 1, we want to consider the above inequality when is a fixed integer, and l &gt; 2.

Reference-contexts: While this is true, these results are asymptotic in nature, and don't really apply to a very localized region <ref> [12] </ref>. <p> This phenomenon is due to the fact that if a function is zero at the origin, and its low order derivatives are zero at the origin, multiplication by the sign (x) will not cause a discontinuity in the function, or in its low order derivatives. The algorithm presented in <ref> [12] </ref> relied on wavelets, which have zero moments, to localize the Radon transform. The finest wavelets have very well localized support, and therefore their coefficients can be calculated from local measurements of the Radon transform. <p> The finest scale wavelets are well localized, and therefore no interpolation is necessary, since their coefficients can be calculated locally. The intermediate scale wavelets, however, require additional information in order to interpolate their values. These intermediate scale wavelets cause the algorithm presented in <ref> [12] </ref> to be suboptimal. Instead of interpolating the coefficients of these intermediate scale wavelets, we want to combine the frequency content of these wavelets with the frequency content of the fine scale wavelets. <p> This algorithm reduces the amount of needed radiation by a factor of 2 from wavelet localized tomography <ref> [12] </ref>, without the use of interlaced sampling. When compared to conventional sampling, this algorithm reduces radiation exposure by 80% or more, when a localized region is to be imaged.

It has been pointed out that it is difficult in current commercial machines to gather localized data, in the method proposed in <ref> [12] </ref>. It is much easier to gather the type data needed for this algorithm. One would simply use one "slow" helical fan beam scan, whose beams pass through the localized region of interest to gather the localized data.

Reference-contexts: Medical CT scanners, for instance, reconstruct the two-dimensional densities of slices of the body, from one-dimensional x-rays or line integrals. The theoretical basis for CT is the Radon transform. The Radon transform was first introduced by J. Radon in 1917 <ref> [13] </ref>. Little computational attention was given to it until the advent of computers enabled the fast evaluation of Fourier transforms and their corresponding convolutions. A.M. Cormack investigated many of the numerical issues involved in computerized tomography, and built the first CT machine in the 1960's. G.N.
