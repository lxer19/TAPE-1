Abstract: Intelligent information retrieval (IIR) requires inference. The number of inferences that can be drawn by even a simple reasoner is very large, and the inferential resources available to any practical computer system are limited. This problem is one long faced by AI researchers. In this paper, we present a method used by two recent machine learning programs for control of inference that is relevant to the design of IIR systems. The key feature of the approach is the use of explicit representations of desired knowledge, which we call knowledge goals. Our theory addresses the representation of knowledge goals, methods for generating and transforming these goals, and heuristics for selecting among potential inferences in order to feasibly satisfy such goals. In this view, IIR becomes a kind of planning: decisions about what to infer, how to infer and when to infer are based on representations of desired knowledge, as well as internal representations of the system's inferential abilities and current state. The theory is illustrated using two case studies, a natural language understanding program that learns by reading novel newspaper stories, and a differential diagnosis program that improves its accuracy with experience. We conclude by making several suggestions on how this machine learning framework can be integrated with existing information retrieval methods.

Reference-contexts: (usually inferential) actions to satisfy specific goals for knowledge. 2 Computer programs with knowledge goals: Two case studies The utility of goal orientation as a basis for theories of information processing has been proposed previously, both as a psychological model of focus of attention during text processing in people (e.g., <ref> [Zukier, 1986; Hoffman et al., 1981; Srull and Wyer, 1986] </ref>) and as a computational model for artificial intelligence programs (e.g., [Ram, 1989; Hunter, 1989; Hunter, 1990a; Ram, 1990b; Ram and Hunter, 1991]).

Reference-contexts: be input by human users, may be persistent goals left over from previous queries, or may even be new questions generated by the system itself. 2.2 The IVY program Another, rather different, example is IVY, a program that does differential diagnoses and is intended to improve its accuracy with experience <ref> [Hunter, 1989] </ref>. The basic idea was to design a program that improves its accuracy by storing information from the cases it diagnoses correctly. The problem is that there is a huge amount of information in the correctly diagnosed cases.

Reference-contexts: IVY's planning abilities were limited to selection among and instantiation of eight different plan schemas. Knowledge goal skeletons had from one to three plan schemas associated with them. INVESTIGATOR <ref> [Hunter, 1990b; Hunter, 1990a] </ref> uses a more flexible knowledge acquisition planner. Depending on the specifics of the knowledge goal (i.e., characteristics of the variable bindings in the goal skeletons), one or more of the plan schemata are instantiated. <p> Second, automatically generated characterizations of desired knowledge can be used to screen large amounts of information that changes over time to find useful knowledge. Later work <ref> [Hunter, 1990a; Hunter, 1990b] </ref> has also shown that abstractly specified desires for knowledge can be transformed, in a process similar to subgoal decomposition planning, into a series of database queries and inferential steps that address the abstract goal.

The theory of knowledge goals and planning presented in this paper is both cognitively motivated and functionally justified.

Reference-contexts: New tasks can give rise to new knowledge goals, which are suspended along with the tasks if answers are not yet known and cannot be inferred. provides a principled method for controlling inferences during the overall task of extracting information from natural language texts <ref> [Ram, 1990b] </ref>. 2.5 IVY's knowledge goals KGs are generated and acted upon somewhat differently in the IVY program. IVY's task is to diagnose structured descriptions of lung tumor pathology images.

Reference-contexts: With limited inferential capacity and very many potential inferences, reasoners must somehow control the process of inference. Several methods of controlling inference have been proposed. Perhaps the simplest is constrained forward chaining: making as many inferences as possible within the resources constraints. For example, MARGIE <ref> [Rieger, 1975] </ref> made all the justified inferences that required the chaining of no more than 5 of 17 rules.

Reference-contexts: Two of the three "lessons" that IVY learned in response to its knowledge goals were identified by the domain expert, Dr. Yesner, as good teaching cases. One of the images IVY selected had been previously used as an example in one of Dr. Yesner's publications <ref> [Yesner and Carter, 1982] </ref>. The third case discovered by IVY was considered by Dr. Yesner "quite useful" in context.
