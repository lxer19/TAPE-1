Abstract: We introduce a variant of ff-fi search in which each node is associated with two depths rather than one. The purpose of ff-fi search is to find strategies for each player that together establish a value for the root position. A max strategy establishes a lower bound and the min strategy establishes an upper bound. It has long been observed that forced moves should be searched more deeply. Here we make the observation that in the max strategy we are only concerned with the forcedness of max moves and in the min strategy we are only concerned with the forcedness of min moves. This leads to two measures of depth | one for each strategy | and to a two depth variant of ff-fi called ABC search. The two depth approach can be formally derived from conspiracy theory and the structure of the ABC procedure is justified by two theorems relating ABC search and conspiracy numbers.

Reference-contexts: It is one of the justifications for the value of quiescence search in chess. It also clearly underlies the use of check extensions. It is also the motivation for the singular extension heuristic <ref> [ Anantharaman et al., 1990 ] </ref> . However, we believe that effective use of these heuristics has been frustrated 3 by the use of a single depth measurement. <p> The great success of the current world champion com <p>- 28 puter chess program, Deep Thought, is considered to be due in part to the use of singular extensions [ Kopec, 1990 ] , <ref> [ Anantharaman et al., 1990 ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: The result now follows from the induction hypothesis for the children nodes. The statistical model underlying the above theorem is clearly unrealistic. However it does show that conspiracy numbers are a limiting case of more general statistical formulations such as that given by Baum and Smith <ref> [ Baum and Smith, 1993 ] </ref> . Both the above model and the one described by Baum and Smith make the assumption that the deviation of true values from static values behaves independently at each leaf node.

Reference-contexts: Although quiescence search is almost universally used, generating an extension at every capture move tends to generate too large a search tree. Heuristics have been proposed for restricting capture extensions in some way to avoid the avalanche of extra positions <ref> [ Kaindl, 1983 ] </ref> . Here we show that the ABC procedure will automatically search deeper under a fairly restricted class of capture moves. 25 Consider the situation shown in figure 12. This shows a very long capture sequence.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Conspiracy numbers for min-max search were introduced in <ref> [ McAllester, 1988 ] </ref> . Conspiracy numbers provide a game independent theoretical framework for guiding nonuniform growth in min-max game trees. The basic idea is to grow search trees for which one has confidence in the root min-max value. <p> This basic theoretical concept has been used with some success to solve tactical problems in chess [ Schaeffer, 1990 ] . However, conspiracy theory has not been used directly in competitive computer chess programs. We believe this is due to a variety of deficiencies in the algorithm presented in <ref> [ McAllester, 1988 ] </ref> . In this paper we present a new algorithm, ff-fi-conspiracy search, or ABC for short, which is based on conspiracy theory yet overcomes the deficiencies of the earlier procedure. The algorithm presented here is a variant of classical ff-fi search. <p> The details of the ABC procedure described here can undoubtedly be improved in game specific ways. However, we have considerable confidence that the two depth approach will prove superior to the classical one depth approach in ff-fi search. The ABC procedure overcomes four deficiencies of the procedure presented in <ref> [ McAllester, 1988 ] </ref> , which will call the naive conspiracy procedure, or NC for short. First, the NC procedure requires exponential space | the entire search tree must be stored. The ABC procedure, as a variant of ff- fi, requires only linear space.

Reference-contexts: Conspiracy theory measures confidence by measuring the number of leaf values that would have to be changed to bring about a given change in the root value. This basic theoretical concept has been used with some success to solve tactical problems in chess <ref> [ Schaeffer, 1990 ] </ref> . However, conspiracy theory has not been used directly in competitive computer chess programs. We believe this is due to a variety of deficiencies in the algorithm presented in [ McAllester, 1988 ] .

Reference-contexts: The idea that forced lines of play should be explored more deeply goes back to the original chess papers of Shanon and Turing <ref> [ Shanon, 1950 ] </ref> , [ Tur- ing et al., 1953 ] .

It also clearly underlies the use of check extensions. <p> can be viewed as special cases of the conspiracy depth principle. 9.1 Quiescence Search and Capture Extensions Shanon and Turing, in the earliest papers on computer chess, suggested that "forced" variations should be searched beyond the horizon, i.e., to a depth greater than the nominal ply depth of the search <ref> [ Shanon, 1950 ] </ref> , [ Turing et al., 1953 ] . The most immediately successful implementation of this idea has become known as quiescence search. <p> The idea that forced moves should be searched more deeply that unforced moves goes back to the original papers on computer chess by Shanon and Turing <ref> [ Shanon, 1950 ] </ref> , [ Turing et al., 1953 ] . This basic idea underlies most of the heuristics for search to variable depth that have been used in competitive programs, quiescence search, check extensions, and singular extensions being the most notable examples.
