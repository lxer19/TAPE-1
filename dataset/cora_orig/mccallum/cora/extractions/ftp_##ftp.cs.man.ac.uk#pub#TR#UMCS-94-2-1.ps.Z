Reference-contexts: base the decision on whether to send a marker to each of it's successors on three criteria: * The markers the node currently possesses. * The markers its neighbouring nodes currently possess. 1 The definition of a memory prompt is similar to many formal approaches to question answering, such as <ref> [1] </ref>. Most of the examples of memory prompt given in this chapter are in fact phrased as questions. 37 Non-Deterministic Memory Prompt 38 * Generic global instructions that state which sort of markers should go where.

Reference-contexts: Traditional approaches leave a lot to be desired of CBR in terms of a model of reasoning; systems are typically ad hoc in nature and generally applicable principles are hard to extract. Indeed, many exponents of indexing-based CBR view this type of domain specific tailoring as a fundamental necessity <ref> [2, 5, 58, 116, 145] </ref>. However, in order that CBR may be based on more solid theoretical grounds, there is a need to establish an underlying model that is both widely applicable and moves towards a unification of the various identifiable components of the CBR process.

Reference-contexts: Relation weighting also relates to the problem of modifying memory in order to implement learning. Case memories may explicitly represent large numbers of individual experiences and hence there is the potential for employing inductive clustering techniques, such as <ref> [140, 67, 35, 4] </ref>, to build a hierarchy of abstract concepts on top of the cases. The issue of the automated restructuring of memory receives little more than a terse consideration in this thesis (see section 5.3.3).

Reference-contexts: Loosely speaking, this is a correspondence due to like meaning. 2. Pragmatic Similarity A correspondance with respect to particular features of the two descriptions such that the selected features are relevant to the purpose of making the comparison <ref> [75, 5, 105] </ref> 3. Structural Similarity A correspondance between the pattern of relationships that connect components in each description [51]. <p> The alternative to a similarity-based approach to retrieval often used in CBR is indexing. This relies on an analysis of the application domain so as to predetermine those case features that pertain to the way in which cases will be used <ref> [5, 56, 58] </ref>. The indexing principle is that if memory is structured about purpose-directed features, relevant source cases may be retrieved with minimal search. <p> Traditional approaches leave a lot to be desired of CBR in terms of a model of reasoning; systems are typically ad hoc in nature and generally applicable principles are hard to extract. Indeed, many exponents of indexing-based CBR view this type of domain specific tailoring as a fundamental necessity <ref> [2, 5, 58, 116, 145] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The Use of CBR in Weak Theory Domains Highly deductive KBS techniques, such as theorem proving or explanation-based reasoning, depend heavily on the possession of a complete causal model of the problem domain. In weak theory domains, such as law <ref> [6, 16, 7, 125] </ref> the causal model will, at best, be incomplete. In such domains the use of precedent cases (i.e CBR) may be the most suitable form of reasoning.

The notion of similarity can be subdivided with respect to what factors are involved in the similarity comparison between cases.

Reference-contexts: The representation of such a concept would make the example described on page 42 a trivial problem even for serial implementations. However, there are an unlimited number of such "ad hoc" categories <ref> [9] </ref> so this solution can only be applied to intersections that have proved to be of particular importance. The representation scheme developed in chapter 2 provides a more subtle way of making an explicit segregation amongst the members of a set through the use of the context link.

Reference-contexts: Selection of a particular context determines a collection of knowledge items that are of particular interest. These viewpoints are generally orthogonal to any object hierarchy organisation of the knowledge base [91] and typically provide a means of selecting features relevant to a particular purpose <ref> [10, 107] </ref>. For example, goal-based indexing within CBR systems is a variation of this type of context. There are a number of reasons why context needs to be represented in the memory model of this thesis.

Reference-contexts: Analogical recollections that are this abstract will rarely provide useful information from memory. Generally, it is necessary to use a combination of surface-level and abstract features to perform analogical case retrieval <ref> [11] </ref>. What is proposed here is that the analytical knowledge required to link surface features to more abstract principles should, where possible, be represented as world knowledge in memory.

Reference-contexts: The usefulness of relation weighting is seen in terms of improving both the accuracy and efficiency of retrieval by feature-based search. In the development of most AI systems, the issue of how to represent the knowledge required by the system must be addressed <ref> [14] </ref>. Most knowledge representations are tailored to emphasise those aspects of the domain that are most useful for the particular system's application [29]. Accordingly, the knowledge representation developed in this chapter is tailored to the task of case retrieval. The representation requirements are clarified in section 2.1.

In weak theory domains, such as law <ref> [6, 16, 7, 125] </ref> the causal model will, at best, be incomplete.

Reference-contexts: For example, CBR can be used to anticipate problems by referring to previous errors [58, 80]. The assumption of reduced effort is borne out in many applications but must be treated cautiously; as discussed in <ref> [17] </ref>, many of the stages of CBR are themselves complex problems that may only be soluble after significant effort. <p> However, the subjective appeal of CBR may also be misleading. The framework of figure 1.3 is very abstract and should not be misconstrued as an algorithm. Several of the stages of the framework are themselves difficult problems <ref> [17] </ref>. Much of the real interest lies in determining techniques, such as the memory model of this thesis, that permit accomplishment of the various CBR stages. <p> In particular, the process of analogical reasoning also requires encompassment, as explained below. A Comparison of Case-Based to Analogical Reasoning The differences between CBR and Analogical Reasoning (AR) are largely pragmatic <ref> [17] </ref>. The primary difference is that CBR usually operates within a single knowledge domain where as AR, by definition, must link cases in separate domains. <p> Those requirements of the target case which remain unsolved after the transfer of knowledge from the source case. 2. Those aspects of a source case that cannot be transferred compatibly to the target case. Adaptation techniques have been highly researched in CBR and a host of possible techniques exist <ref> [17] </ref>. The general principle behind adaptation is either to modify the incompatible aspects of the source case or to modify any non-crucial requirements of the target case [62].

Reference-contexts: Indeed, even for single domain applications with a relatively strong domain theory, prior determination of what case features are relevant for retrieval may only be partially possible [8]. It is argued in this thesis that similarity should be an integral part of the case retrieval process (see also <ref> [18] </ref>). The notion of similarity can be subdivided with respect to what factors are involved in the similarity comparison between cases. Three general types of similarity are recognised here: 1. Semantic Similarity A correspondance in terms of an overall match between the set of features involved in two descriptions [143]. <p> is 4 10 = 0:4. 13 Namely: I 1 ; I 2 ; I 3 ; I 4 ; I 5 ; I 7 ; I 9 . 14 Namely: I 1 ; I 2 ; I 3 ; I 7 . 26 Typicality is an expensive measure to calculate <ref> [18] </ref> because it is a statistic based on the knowledge base as a whole. However the calculation need only be performed occasionally and may be reserved for times when the system is otherwise not in use. <p> The guards retreated and the robbers escaped. The Realisation of Similarity Measures in CRASH's Retrieval This section reviews how each type of similarity is manifested in CRASH (see also <ref> [18] </ref>).

IN PRESS: to appear in the workshop preprints. </note>
Reference-contexts: The approach taken in this thesis is to replace indexing with a retrieval process that is biased towards the selection of past cases, based on a number of factors that relate to the above similarity types (see <ref> [19] </ref> for a summary of these factors). In order to achieve this the relationship between knowledge representation and knowledge retrieval must be established.

Reference-contexts: Another common approach is simply to replace incompatible components of a source case with an equivalent component from a different source case <ref> [20, 61, 73, 33, 110] </ref>. This latter approach effectively merges multiple source cases to create a composite 88 source case that more completely matches and satisfies the requirements of the target case 7 .

Reference-contexts: There are virtually no CBR systems that do not involve learning in one form or another. Indeed, in some systems the two processes are inseparable <ref> [116, 21] </ref>. The lack of attention given to learning in this thesis is, therefore, somewhat unusual. This is redressed in this section, where various modes of learning are related to the memory model developed in the preceding chapters. In particular, the notion of creative retrieval is discussed.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to CBR, in analogical reasoning the task of generating a mapping between two descriptions remains open-ended. Analogical mapping generally creates an indirect connection between paired case components and is often context sensitive <ref> [22] </ref>. Generally the problem can be characterised as a complex constraint satisfaction problem [40, 138]. Because mapping is not necessarily tied to retrieval, it is often implemented via an expensive and exhaustive search of all possible mappings [34].

Reference-contexts: Adopting the philosophy that a knowledge item gains its meaning from how it relates to other knowledge items <ref> [23] </ref>, it follows that paths linking nodes in a network representation can be ascribed meaning.

Reference-contexts: Metaphorical representations have the potential for high expressive power [144] and are appealing because relatively simple operations upon them can permit strong predictions about actions in the real world <ref> [24] </ref>. For a network representation, there are two basic primitives, "nodes" and "links" (or "arcs").

Reference-contexts: Rather, knowledge can be represented as a collection of largely independent (possibly even contradictory) episodes and hence a minimal amount of knowledge translation is required <ref> [25] </ref>. Robustness and Maintenance Through Incremental Learning Another common problem with KBS is the "plateau of expertise" problem [85]. <p> The more flexible approach, and hence the one adopted in this thesis, is to have a decompositional case representation that permits case fragments to be used in isolation and allows multiple cases to be combined in generating a new problem solution <ref> [34, 25] </ref>. 12 The Need for Supporting Domain Knowledge As has already been noted, the achievement of CBR is a non-trivial task. In particular, a host of additional knowledge, other than cases, may be required to support CBR.

Reference-contexts: A means of avoiding exhaustive search during retrieval is the systematic and purpose-directed organisation of memory. This is the so called "indexing" approach to case retrieval. Indexing has been the most heavily researched area in CBR. A host of techniques exist <ref> [26] </ref> and general purpose indexing tools, such as Re M ind 5 , have recently become commercially available. However, the fact that an application specific structuring of memory is required means that indexing generally does not fulfill the flexibility requirement laid down on page 5.

Reference-contexts: The alternative is to expend some effort in deriving abstract features from the surface features [104]. Abstract features are generally more powerful in terms of the selection of relevant source cases, but are costly to deduce. This is the widely recognised dichotomy of indexing in CBR <ref> [28] </ref>. Assuming that abstract indices are required, two questions must be addressed: * How are the abstract indices derived? * What additional knowledge is required to derive abstract indices? Generally, surface features are interpreted to form more abstract features as a preliminary stage of retrieval.

Reference-contexts: In the development of most AI systems, the issue of how to represent the knowledge required by the system must be addressed [14]. Most knowledge representations are tailored to emphasise those aspects of the domain that are most useful for the particular system's application <ref> [29] </ref>. Accordingly, the knowledge representation developed in this chapter is tailored to the task of case retrieval. The representation requirements are clarified in section 2.1. In section 2.2 it is argued that a network representation is the most appropriate for the proposed memory model.

Reference-contexts: An example of assumption-based inference used in [41, page 25] is "John wanted to be chairman of the department. He bought some arsenic". The claim is that the implicit connecting theme between the two sentences is "assassination". Similarly Charniak <ref> [30] </ref> uses the example of "John wanted to commit suicide", "John got a rope.". Here the most obvious implication is that John is going to hang himself. Both the above example inferences may be made using exhaustive marker passing to perform set intersection. <p> This point is illustrated below by a comparison to similar hybrid systems. 4.4.1 A Comparison to Similar Hybrid Systems Charniak was one of the first to postulate that natural language processing requires a combination of symbolic reasoning about syntax and a more probablistic judgement of plausible word semantics <ref> [30] </ref>. In his WIMP system [31] an activation passing process is used to find potential semantic paths between words in a sentence. Once retrieved, these paths are vetted by a more deductive reasoner to extract those that can be used to make valid inferences. Problems were encountered with WIMP.

Reference-contexts: The most efficient way this can be achieved is to add a tag that uniquely identifies to which distribution an activation marker belongs. This approach has been used frequently in marker passing systems <ref> [41, 96, 31, 81] </ref>. The colour tagging solution advocated in this thesis is described below. Activation is assumed to proceed via a series of constrained steps. <p> In his WIMP system <ref> [31] </ref> an activation passing process is used to find potential semantic paths between words in a sentence. Once retrieved, these paths are vetted by a more deductive reasoner to extract those that can be used to make valid inferences. Problems were encountered with WIMP.

Reference-contexts: One possible solution is to use parallel techniques so that many previous cases can be compared to the current target case in a single time step <ref> [34, 33] </ref>. However, as will be discussed in chapter 3, parallelism alone does not solve the most complex and general retrieval problems. <p> This notion has been exploited by researchers in analogical reasoning in an attempt to make analogical retrieval a syntactic graph-matching process <ref> [33, 148, 51] </ref>, though it is highly debatable how central a role graph-matching alone plays. A related idea is the proximity principle which states that the network distance between two nodes in the representation is indicative of the similarity of the two knowledge items they represent. <p> The objection to this normal model for activation passing is twofold. Firstly for CBR it is usually more useful to retrieve a corpus of several relevant previous cases rather than a single most relevant case <ref> [80, 33, 133] </ref>. Grading of relevance within this corpus is of course useful and is indeed a central goal for the proposed memory model. However, the combination of information from multiple source cases should not be precluded. <p> Another common approach is simply to replace incompatible components of a source case with an equivalent component from a different source case <ref> [20, 61, 73, 33, 110] </ref>. This latter approach effectively merges multiple source cases to create a composite 88 source case that more completely matches and satisfies the requirements of the target case 7 . <p> In particular, the amalgamation of feature-based retrievals during phase 3 occurs after the completion of the search of the network of memory in phase 2. In this sense, CRASH suffers from the same weakness as other systems, such as MAC/FAC [47], ANAGRAM <ref> [33] </ref> and PARADYME [80], that treat retrieval as a process that is fundamentally multi-staged. By delaying the application of the constraints applied in the more selective later stages, a lot of wasted effort is expended in the earlier stages.

Reference-contexts: Not surprisingly, this makes AR the more difficult type of reasoning to perform; in particular, there is a necessity to comply with the flexibility requirement for retrieval given earlier. Although several admirable implementations of analogical retrieval have recently been developed <ref> [139, 34, 45, 48, 82] </ref> none of these systems achieve their flexibility without a potentially high computational cost. The main contribution of the model developed in 9 this thesis is, therefore, to explain how flexibility in case retrieval may be achieved for relatively low effort. <p> One possible solution is to use parallel techniques so that many previous cases can be compared to the current target case in a single time step <ref> [34, 33] </ref>. However, as will be discussed in chapter 3, parallelism alone does not solve the most complex and general retrieval problems. <p> The more flexible approach, and hence the one adopted in this thesis, is to have a decompositional case representation that permits case fragments to be used in isolation and allows multiple cases to be combined in generating a new problem solution <ref> [34, 25] </ref>. 12 The Need for Supporting Domain Knowledge As has already been noted, the achievement of CBR is a non-trivial task. In particular, a host of additional knowledge, other than cases, may be required to support CBR. <p> Generally the problem can be characterised as a complex constraint satisfaction problem [40, 138]. Because mapping is not necessarily tied to retrieval, it is often implemented via an expensive and exhaustive search of all possible mappings <ref> [34] </ref>. This is a violation of the desire for efficiency in the model of memory. To illustrate how CRASH is capable of producing the required flexibility in mapping with improved efficiency it is compared in the remainder of this section to two admirable analogical mapping systems.

Reference-contexts: Relation weighting also relates to the problem of modifying memory in order to implement learning. Case memories may explicitly represent large numbers of individual experiences and hence there is the potential for employing inductive clustering techniques, such as <ref> [140, 67, 35, 4] </ref>, to build a hierarchy of abstract concepts on top of the cases. The issue of the automated restructuring of memory receives little more than a terse consideration in this thesis (see section 5.3.3). <p> Collections of features that have occurred together in previous cases (of the same type) are assumed to have done so due to some underlying reason, hence may be expected to occur together in future cases <ref> [67, 35, 95, 38] </ref>. It follows that a solution from a source case is more likely to be applicable to a target case if the two cases are semantically similar (assuming that the source case satisfies the necessary requirements of the target case).

Reference-contexts: The problems arise from not being able to distinguish between activation from different sources. One way of avoiding the problem is to perform activation passing sequentially <ref> [37] </ref> such that the activation distribution from at most one target case feature is present in memory at any one time. However, In chapter 3 it was shown that it is often the intersection of two independent retrieval paths that is required. <p> The competition arises because the more activation a node possesses the stronger it can inhibit its competitors which in turn reduces the competitors' inhibition of that node. In particular, it is often postulated that an explicit inhibitor should exist between all nodes of a mutually exclusive set <ref> [37, 90, 139] </ref>. The second objection to traditional approaches is that, unfortunately, explicit inhibition is generally inefficient, if not impractical. For a set of n mutually exclusive nodes, n 2 inhibitory links are required.

Reference-contexts: (see page 68) increases the bias towards cases that are semantically similar due to the large number of connections between them and the target case. 4 This exponential decay also has some psychological plausibility as it is in agreement with empirical evidence concerning the confusability (i.e. similarity) of perceived stimuli <ref> [121, 39, 122] </ref>. 79 Pragmatic similarity corresponds to the use of context to select relations in CRASH. By the arguments of section 4.4, semantic and pragmatic similarity are intertwined in phase 2 of CRASH's retrieval.

Reference-contexts: Another important point is that, although the various steps of the framework are usually performed in the order presented in figure 1.3, there is often a high degree of interaction between them <ref> [40] </ref>. It will be argued in chapter 5 that the approach taken in this thesis, which emphasizes the role of memory and the process of retrieval, is sufficient to subsume most of the stages of the CBR framework. <p> More generally, there may exist many different criteria that determine how features should be paired [148], and generally mapping interacts in an intimate way with the other stages of the CBR process <ref> [40] </ref>. The view taken here is that the process of retrieval determines feature mappings. <p> In contrast to CBR, in analogical reasoning the task of generating a mapping between two descriptions remains open-ended. Analogical mapping generally creates an indirect connection between paired case components and is often context sensitive [22]. Generally the problem can be characterised as a complex constraint satisfaction problem <ref> [40, 138] </ref>. Because mapping is not necessarily tied to retrieval, it is often implemented via an expensive and exhaustive search of all possible mappings [34]. This is a violation of the desire for efficiency in the model of memory.

Reference-contexts: The knowledge representation proposed here is more akin to "scruffy" AI approaches to network representation, such as <ref> [41] </ref>, or to the propositional network models of psychology [132]. A variety of types of knowledge may need to be represented in the network. For example, in figure 2.1 there are some relations, such as those that represent topological relationships, whose associated truth is invariable. <p> It follows that each node can be thought of as, and implemented by, a simple processing element [84, 42]. Massive parallelism allows the intersection of two large sets of nodes to be performed as a relatively trivial operation taking approximately constant time <ref> [42, 41] </ref>. This one operation may lie at the heart of a number of reasoning tasks related to the process of retrieval, as will be described in section 3.3. <p> Fahlman <ref> [41, chapter 2] </ref> identifies the ability to perform rapid set intersection as the major characteristic of tasks that are readily achieved in human intelligence yet highly difficult for serial AI applications. <p> To illustrate this, consider the task of answering the question "Is Daisy warm blooded?" where Daisy is a Jersey cow represented in a knowledge base including extensive taxonomic knowledge. The type of solution adopted in systems, such as NetL <ref> [41] </ref>, is shown in figure 3.2. The key assumption of massively parallel marker passing is that traversing all relations of a specified type out of all nodes possessing a selected marker type takes only one unit of time 2 . <p> A number of examples of this type of massively parallel information retrieval, taken from the litertaure, are presented below. 2 This assumption has proven valid for Single-Instruction Multiple-Data (SIMD) machines [78]. 40 Question Answering 41 3.3.2 Some Examples An example taken from <ref> [41] </ref> that is similar to the above is "does any royal person own a weapon?". In this case the query is answered by traversing down the type hierarchy to find all instances of royalty and all instances of known weapons. <p> The known features from which the assumption-based inference stems will form the seeds of the memory prompt and the query set for the prompt establishes a body of knowledge that should be inferred through the retrieval. An example of assumption-based inference used in <ref> [41, page 25] </ref> is "John wanted to be chairman of the department. He bought some arsenic". The claim is that the implicit connecting theme between the two sentences is "assassination". Similarly Charniak [30] uses the example of "John wanted to commit suicide", "John got a rope.". <p> The most efficient way this can be achieved is to add a tag that uniquely identifies to which distribution an activation marker belongs. This approach has been used frequently in marker passing systems <ref> [41, 96, 31, 81] </ref>. The colour tagging solution advocated in this thesis is described below. Activation is assumed to proceed via a series of constrained steps. <p> Context 2 This type of cyclic retrieval process, whereby the initial retrieval of some knowledge item focuses the attention of memory towards the additional features of that knowledge item, may provide a general memory-based reasoning approach to the problem of feature-based recognition <ref> [41, pp 51-58] </ref>. 120 provides an extra dimension of control by which a network representation can be segre-gated. Precompiled context sequences, such as used in the experimentation of chapter 6, can be applied by an external controller so as to superimpose a selective retrieval strategy upon the memory model.

Reference-contexts: Further, the complex data structure required to store the dynamic search tree of nodes and their respective costs is converted into small amounts of local storage within each node. It follows that each node can be thought of as, and implemented by, a simple processing element <ref> [84, 42] </ref>. Massive parallelism allows the intersection of two large sets of nodes to be performed as a relatively trivial operation taking approximately constant time [42, 41]. <p> It follows that each node can be thought of as, and implemented by, a simple processing element [84, 42].

Reference-contexts: Her "systematicity principle" states that: "Analogy conveys a system of connected knowledge, not a mere assortment of independent facts. Preferring systems of predicates that contain higher-order relations with inferential import is a syntactic expression of this tacit preference for coherence and deductive power in analogy." <ref> [43] </ref> The memory model of this thesis does not treat the pattern of relationships between two descriptions as the fundamental constraint on retrieval (though as argued in appendix L a bias towards preserving relational structure may also exist in retrieval). <p> The systems produced by these research projects are: the Structure Mapping Engine (SME) <ref> [43, 44, 50, 51] </ref> and its successor MAC/FAC [45, 47, 48]; ARCS [139] and its sibling ACME [138]; and REMIND [82] and its predecessor ROBIN [81].

Reference-contexts: It follows that the validity of the hierarchical decomposition of cases is a knowledge engineering issue (see section 6.3.2 for an example of this). Another interesting comparison can be made between the scheme proposed here for structure preservation and that proposed by Gentner et al <ref> [49, 51, 44] </ref>. Her "systematicity principle" states that: "Analogy conveys a system of connected knowledge, not a mere assortment of independent facts. <p> A possibility is given in figure 5.6. The point about the recollection in figure 5.6 is that it has little semantic similarity with respect to the initial problem description. The commonality lies in the pattern of relationships between the entities. It has been strongly argued elsewhere <ref> [148, 75, 44, 63] </ref> that preservation of relational structure in a match between a source case and a target case is important if a sound inference of knowledge from the former to the latter is to be carried out. <p> To illustrate how CRASH is capable of producing the required flexibility in mapping with improved efficiency it is compared in the remainder of this section to two admirable analogical mapping systems. The Structure-Mapping Engine (SME) SME <ref> [44] </ref> is based on the systematicity principle, (see section 4.2.2). The emphasis is on preserving relational structure during mapping. SME proceeds via four main stages: 1. Local Match Construction. All possible feature pairings are found. 2. Global Map (Gmap) Construction. <p> Again, this is comparable to what occurs in CRASH during phase 2. However, compared to the subtle combination of various criteria that is performed during CRASH's activation passing, the assignment of weights to mappings in SME seems somewhat crude and arbitrary (see <ref> [44, appendix A] </ref>). The Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine (ACME) Holyoak and Thagard's ACME system [138] provides the closest comparison to the CRASH model of mapping. Both systems incorporate pragmatic, semantic and structural similarity as constraints on mapping. <p> The systems produced by these research projects are: the Structure Mapping Engine (SME) <ref> [43, 44, 50, 51] </ref> and its successor MAC/FAC [45, 47, 48]; ARCS [139] and its sibling ACME [138]; and REMIND [82] and its predecessor ROBIN [81]. These projects have already been considered at various points in the thesis.

Reference-contexts: Not surprisingly, this makes AR the more difficult type of reasoning to perform; in particular, there is a necessity to comply with the flexibility requirement for retrieval given earlier. Although several admirable implementations of analogical retrieval have recently been developed <ref> [139, 34, 45, 48, 82] </ref> none of these systems achieve their flexibility without a potentially high computational cost. The main contribution of the model developed in 9 this thesis is, therefore, to explain how flexibility in case retrieval may be achieved for relatively low effort. <p> The PARADYME system [79] is representative of the problem. Although PARADYME uses a massively parallel approach to retrieve all partially-matching cases, it's success relies heavily on the subsequent selection of retrieved cases based on a variety of preference heuristics. Similarly the MAC/FAC system <ref> [45, 48] </ref> employs a two stage process whereby the first stage involves a cheap and consequently inaccurate measure for relevance which acts as a filter on the cases in memory prior to employing the second and more rigorous stage for final selection of cases. <p> The systems produced by these research projects are: the Structure Mapping Engine (SME) [43, 44, 50, 51] and its successor MAC/FAC <ref> [45, 47, 48] </ref>; ARCS [139] and its sibling ACME [138]; and REMIND [82] and its predecessor ROBIN [81].

Reference-contexts: For example, forming a clear distinction between the roles of structural and semantic similarity in retrieval requires a more heterogeneous knowledge base than is offered by the bin-packing problem. An interesting test-bed for future experimentation with CRASH may be provided by the "Karla the Hawk" stories <ref> [46] </ref> used by Gentner et al in the testing of SME and MAC/FAC. These stories form a set of short descriptive passages which differentiate from each other along the separated dimensions of surface-level (i.e. semantic similarity) and structural similarity.

Reference-contexts: The systems produced by these research projects are: the Structure Mapping Engine (SME) [43, 44, 50, 51] and its successor MAC/FAC <ref> [45, 47, 48] </ref>; ARCS [139] and its sibling ACME [138]; and REMIND [82] and its predecessor ROBIN [81]. These projects have already been considered at various points in the thesis. <p> MAC/FAC achieves flexibility by coupling a cheap and crude filter of memory, based on the use of content vectors, with the more rigorous selectivity performed by SME in `literal similarity' mode <ref> [47] </ref>. However, MAC/FAC is fundamentally a two-stage process; the semantic constraints of its MAC phase are not conjoined with the primarily structural constraints of the FAC stage. In addition, the FAC stage is driven purely by a direct comparison of source cases to the initial memory prompt. <p> In particular, the amalgamation of feature-based retrievals during phase 3 occurs after the completion of the search of the network of memory in phase 2. In this sense, CRASH suffers from the same weakness as other systems, such as MAC/FAC <ref> [47] </ref>, ANAGRAM [33] and PARADYME [80], that treat retrieval as a process that is fundamentally multi-staged. By delaying the application of the constraints applied in the more selective later stages, a lot of wasted effort is expended in the earlier stages.

These projects have already been considered at various points in the thesis. <p> It follows that contextual guidance and the guidance of intermediate world knowledge are lacking from the MAC/FAC retrieval mechanism. Hence, though the MAC system is flexible enough to produce psychologically plausible results <ref> [48] </ref>, the delayed application of structural constraints detracts from the selectiveness of its preliminary retrieval stage (see page 119 for 115 a clarification of this point).

Her "systematicity principle" states that: "Analogy conveys a system of connected knowledge, not a mere assortment of independent facts. <p> For people, this type of flexibility seems a necessity as the complexity of the real world means that a new experience rarely complies fully with our preconceived model of the world. Hence, psychological theories of memory are often centered around a similarity-based model for knowledge representation and retrieval <ref> [49, 63, 112, 101, 94] </ref>. By an extension of this argument, for an artificial implementation of a memory for which flexibility is a major goal, it is reasonable to suppose that similarity assessment is an important function to be performed by the retrieval mechanism. <p> The generation of a local mapping in SME is comparable to the generation of a path between a source and target case node in CRASH. In SME the process is governed by a set of heuristic rules <ref> [49] </ref>. In particular (in the analogical mode) SME creates mappings between pairs of predicates with the same functor, then attempts to create a mapping between the arguments of the two predicates. <p> Conversely, in CRASH, for a local mapping there must be at least some, possibly indirect, semantic similarity between the paired features. This is not considered a weakness as there exists a host of evidence that suggests that, in human analogical retrieval, some semantic similarity link is required <ref> [63, 49, 120] </ref>. Admittedly, structural similarity is indicated as being more important when subjects, presented with two cases, are asked to assess the soundness of the mapping [50]. However, this is a different problem to that being tackled in CRASH.
