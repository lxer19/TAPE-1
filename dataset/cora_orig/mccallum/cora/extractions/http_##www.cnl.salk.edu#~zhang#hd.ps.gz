Abstract: The head-direction (HD) cells found in the limbic system in freely moving rats represent the instantaneous head direction of the animal in the horizontal plane regardless of the location of the animal. The internal direction represented by these cells uses both self-motion information for inertially based updating and familiar visual landmarks for calibration. Here, a model of the dynamics of the HD cell ensemble is presented. The stability of a localized static activity profile in the network and a dynamic shift mechanism are explained naturally by synaptic weight distribution components with even and odd symmetry, respectively. Under symmetric weights or symmetric reciprocal connections, a stable activity profile close to the known directional tuning curves will emerge. By adding a slight asymmetry to the weights, the activity profile will shift continuously without disturbances to its shape, and the shift speed can be accurately controlled by the strength of the odd-weight component. The generic formulation of the shift mechanism is determined uniquely within the current theoretical framework. The attractor dynamics of the system ensures modality-independence of the internal representation and facilitates the correction for cumulative error by the putative local-view detectors. The model offers a specific one-dimensional example of a computational mechanism in which a truly world-centered representation can be derived from observer-centered sensory inputs by integrating self-motion information.

Conversely, some thalamic HD cells still could be found after lesions to the postsubiculum (Goodridge & Taube, 1994, new results in the poster presentation). The activities of thalamic HD cells were severely disrupted by vestibular lesions (Stackman & Taube, 1995).

So it seems that the thalamic HD cells can survive without postsubiculum, but not the other way around.

Reference-contexts: In addition, Hebbian-type plasticity might serve to ensure the structural stability of the system (cf. Appendix 2). For fine-tuning of the shift speed, the system also needs teaching signals obtained from sources other than the vestibular input itself, perhaps including the direct retinal projections to the AD nucleus <ref> (Itaya et al., 1986) </ref>. 5.3 Effect of acceleration and the anticipatory activities We have shown that the speed of the activity shift is proportional to the strength fl of the odd (derivative) weight component.

At any given time, the most active HD cells are the ones with preferred directions close to the current head direction.

Reference-contexts: In approaching a place with salient landmarks that was seen initially with an incorrect sense of direction, the currently correct sense of direction can suddenly flip back to the wrong orientation again when the landmarks are recognized, in what can feel like a sudden vertiginous rotation of the whole world <ref> (Jonsson, 1993, and the references therein) </ref>. All these phenomena can be explained naturally if we assume that HD cells similar to the ones found in rats also exist in humans and that the subjective sense of orientation is determined by the preferred directions of the currently active HD cells.

Reference-contexts: Other parameters are as in Figure 3. activities centered at the animal's current location. The model described above is essentially analogous to the HD model: The lump of activity can be self-sustaining without sensory inputs, and self-motion signals alone are sufficient to drive the lump to a new location <ref> (cf. McNaughton et al., 1996) </ref>. A related problem is the possible moving spot of activity in the superior colliculus during eye movements (Munoz et al., 1991). Additional simulation shows that a modified model with more localized inhibitory background is able to move several Gaussian-like activity spots simultaneously (cf.

The recording results can be compared readily with the model, which given any initial state and external input is able to predict quantitatively the time evolution of the average firing rates of the whole HD cell population (cf. Figures 3, 6,7, and 10).

The mammillary body might also be involved (Blair, 1996).

Reference-contexts: Inertially based updating Despite the strong control exerted by visual landmarks, the directional firings of HD cells persist in total darkness, presumably by integrating self-motion information (McNaughton et al., 1991; Mizumori & Williams, 1993). Understandably, the preferred directions may drift during prolonged recordings in darkness <ref> (Mizumori & Williams, 1993) </ref>. 3 when the head direction is aligned with the preferred direction 0 .

Data from Figure 4B in Taube (1995). <p> As a consequence, it cannot explain some important differences among HD cells, in particular, the variable behaviors in a restrained animal.

Reference-contexts: In fact, if the cells with similar preferred directions were all close to each other in the brain, then during learning they would likely be affected together because of the chemical diffusion in the three-dimensional volume <ref> (e.g., Montague & Sejnowski, 1994) </ref>, which would encourage clustering rather than rotation-invariance of the weight distribution. 5 Dynamic shift mechanism 5.1 Basic principles We consider the shift mechanism within the framework of the same dynamic equation (Eq. 2).

Reference-contexts: From a theoretical point of view, the HD system is very interesting. It provides compelling neurobiological evidence for stable attractor dynamics; at the same time, it forces consideration of the challenging problem of how to shift a stable activity profile <ref> (cf. Pouget & Sejnowski, 1995) </ref>. The system is particularly appealing because it is intrinsically one-dimensional, and its operation is smooth and thus potentially subject to continuous analytical treatment.

Reference-contexts: The acceleration term leads to the anticipatory activities with the time lead t 1 provided that t 1 &gt; 0. As mentioned before, the odd weight component is probably induced by vestibular inputs among other sources of movement information, e.g., the angular speed sensitive cells found in the postsubiculum <ref> (Sharp, 1996) </ref> and the parietal cortex (McNaughton et al., 1994). The mammillary body might also be involved (Blair, 1996). In general, neural head motion signals may contain information about both the speed and the acceleration (Precht, 1978; Wilson & Jones, 1979).

Reference-contexts: The rotation of a sole salient visual cue in a controlled environment would lead to an almost equal rotation of the preferred directions of all HD cells <ref> (Taube et al., 1990b) </ref>. A long-lasting association between the internal direction and a new environment can be established within minutes; and when the internal direction is later in conflict with the familiar landmarks, the landmarks will dominate (Taube & Burton, 1995; Goodridge & Taube, 1995). <p> That is, the rotation angles for the preferred directions of different HD cells are always the same, whether the rotation is caused by landmark rotation or disorientation of the animal <ref> (Taube et al., 1990b) </ref>. The HD cells are also rigidly coupled with the hippocampal place cells (Knierim et al., 1995). Behavioral significance The working hypothesis is that the internal direction represented by the HD cells corresponds to the internal "sense of direction" of the animal.

Reference-contexts: Their dynamic shift mechanisms have various features, including, in broad terms, the conjunction of the current head direction and movement information (McNaughton et al., 1991; McNaughton et al., 1995; Skaggs et al., 1995), the anticipatory activities in the thalamus (Blair, 1996), and the rotation of sinusoidal arrays <ref> (Touretzky et al., 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Rigorously speaking, the introduction of any small noise in the weight profile always destroys the rotation-invariance, only allowing a few possible static activity profiles (Fig. 5). In other words, neutral equilibrium is structurally unstable. Similar clustering effects have been reported in a hippocampal place-cell model <ref> (Tsodyks & Sejnowski, 1995) </ref>. The relevant question with respect to the second type of noise is how fast the clustering drift is expected to be in a network of the size comparable to the real head-direction system.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the principle of the shift mechanism might be relevant to other computational problems in which accurate velocity integration is important. A direct assessment of the appropriateness of the dynamic model is feasible with the current parallel recording techniques <ref> (cf. Wilson & McNaughton, 1993) </ref>. The recording results can be compared readily with the model, which given any initial state and external input is able to predict quantitatively the time evolution of the average firing rates of the whole HD cell population (cf. Figures 3, 6,7, and 10).

Reference-contexts: Such knowledge is important for any refined future theory. For example, whether the cells in the thalamic AD nucleus might behave differently from the cells in more familiar relay nuclei like the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) has not been tested directly <ref> (cf. Zhuravleva et al., 1989) </ref>. One crucial ingredient of the model is the dynamic shift mechanism, the mathematical formulation of which can be determined uniquely by the minimal disturbance requirement and the symmetry of the traveling activity profile.
