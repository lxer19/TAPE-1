Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 320 Appears in: IEEE Trans. on PAMI, vol. 18, no. 7, July 1996, pp. 722-733 This is a revised version of TR No. 320 (March 1995) Abstract In this paper, we present an image model with a new set of features that address the challenge of perceptual similarity. The model is based on the 2-D Wold decomposition of homogeneous random fields. The three resulting mutually orthogonal subfields have perceptual properties which can be described as "periodicity", "directional-ity", and "randomness", approximating what are indicated to be the three most important dimensions of human texture perception. The method presented here improves upon earlier Wold-based models in its tolerance to a variety of local inho-mogeneities which arise in natural textures and its invariance under image transformation such as rotation. An image retrieval algorithm based on the new texture model is presented. Different types of image features are aggregated for similarity comparison by using a Bayesian probabilistic approach. The effectiveness of the Wold model at retrieving perceptually similar natural textures is demonstrated in comparison to that of two other well-known pattern recognition methods. The Wold model appears to offer a perceptually more satisfying measure of pattern similarity while exceeding the performance of these other methods by traditional pattern recognition criteria. Examples of natural scene Wold texture modeling are also presented.

Reference-contexts: Considering image retrieval as a pattern recognition application, we face the difficult problem of choosing a set of features for measuring perceptual similarity. A human texture perception study conducted by Rao and Lohse <ref> [1] </ref> has indicated that the three most important perceptual dimensions in natural texture discrimination can be described as "repetitiveness", "directionality", and "granularity and complexity". Hence, it is desirable for a texture-based retrieval system to use modeling features which relate image attributes to these perceptual saliencies. <p> to model an image with many spectral peaks (spatially periodic structures), it is often difficult to avoid both the information loss inherent in fitting with a low-order model and the extra computation and overfitting with a higher-order model. 3.1.3 Constructing the New Wold Model Perceptually, by Rao and Lohse's study <ref> [1] </ref>, the existence of periodic structure is the strongest perceptual cue in texture discrimination. We carefully examined the Fourier spectra of all the images in the Brodatz database, concluding the following: * Natural textures often contain multiple Wold components.

Reference-contexts: By Theorem 2, the decomposition of the purely-indeterministic and the deterministic components of a regular homogeneous random field can be achieved by separating the singular and the absolutely continuous components of the SDF. This is known as Lebesgue decomposition <ref> [8] </ref>. In order to apply the 2-D Wold theory to texture modeling, some approximations on the deterministic random fields were made [3]. A half-plane deterministic field is approximated by a harmonic random field, which in the spectral domain appears as the 2-D Dirac ffi-functions supported by discrete points.

Reference-contexts: As shown in (2), the purely-indeterministic field has a white noise driven MA representation. Under certain conditions usually satisfied in practice, a 2-D autoregressive (AR) representation of this field exists <ref> [9] </ref>. In the following, we refer to the harmonic, evanescent, and indeterministic components of a random field as the Wold components. 2.2 Previous Work on Wold-based Texture Modeling A Wold-based model can be built by decomposing an image into its Wold components and modeling each of the components separately.

Reference-contexts: 1) the spectral decomposition method | an approximation of Lebesgue decomposition as global thresholding of Fourier spectral magnitudes [2][3]; 2) the maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimation | estimating Wold parameters in the spatial domain by fitting a high-order AR process, minimizing a cost function, and solving sets of linear equations <ref> [10] </ref>. The effectiveness of these methods was demonstrated on a few texture examples. Comparing the two approaches, the ML method provides more accurate estimates, but the spectral decomposition method is computationally more efficient.

Reference-contexts: However, we found that a simple global thresholding scheme, as the one used in [3], does not work for many natural textures in the Brodatz database. A decomposition example is given in Figure 1. A patch of Brodatz texture <ref> [11] </ref> D11 "Homespun woolen cloth", shown in (a), is decomposed by extracting the harmonic peak frequencies of its Fourier spectrum. Shown in (b), the Fourier magnitude of this pattern has five high frequency peaks 1 which are only locally large. <p> It contains 1008 natural texture patches cropped from all 112 pictures in the Brodatz Album <ref> [11] </ref>. Each Brodatz texture provides nine 128 fi 128 subimages in 8-bit gray levels. This collection contains a large variety of natural textures, including the many inhomogeneous ones which are not usually included in texture studies.

Reference-contexts: By including the entire Bro-datz collection in the database, we allow the potential of confusion and failure that exists when texture algorithms encounter non-texture regions in natural scenes. Examples of the database are shown in Figure 2. 3.1.2 Other Texture Models Using the benchmarking method reported in <ref> [14] </ref>, the retrieval performance of several image models over the Bro-datz database was evaluated by computing their recognition rate operating characteristics. The image classes are defined by the original Brodatz album pages. <p> The two latter models are described and benchmarked in <ref> [14] </ref>. The pictures are in the format of the "Photobook" display window. The upper left image is the user selected prototype image. In raster-scan order after the prototype, the retrieved images are shown by descending similarity to the prototype 5 .

Reference-contexts: For example, if the first 15 retrieved images are considered and 4 matches are found for an image, then the recognition rate for that image at retrieved set size 15 is 50%. The models evaluated include the MRSAR, the SPCA, the tree-structured wavelet transform (TWT) 2 <ref> [15] </ref>, and the three Tamura features of coarseness, contrast, and directionality [16] as used in [17]. Note that this evaluation method uses a traditional pattern recognition criterion, not necessarily agreeing with perceptual criteria. <p> Examples will be shown in Figure 8 and 9 in Section 4.2. This weakness of the MRSAR model is innate since the model only 2 The TWT method is sensitive to image sizes.

Reference-contexts: The benchmarking results show that, when compared to the other three, the MRSAR model offers the best intra-class recognition rate (see Figure 13 in Section 6.2). Recently, a Gabor wavelet decomposition model was also applied to image retrieval and its performance benchmarked against the MRSAR model <ref> [18] </ref>. By the recognition rate operating characteristics, the retrieval performance of the Gabor and MRSAR methods are similar. Therefore, by this criterion, it would be reasonable to regard MRSAR as a representative of the state-of-the-art texture modeling for image database retrieval.
