Title: Computational Methods for Singularly Perturbed Systems  
Author: Slimane Adjerid, Mohammed Aiffa, and Joseph E. Flaherty 
Abstract: The difficulty encountered when solving singularly perturbed differential equations is that errors introduced in layers pollute the solution in smooth regions. Since a priori control of the errors in layers is difficult, special methods must be designed to reduce or eliminate polluting errors. Successful methods add dissipation to a computational scheme to enlarge layers to the mesh spacing. We focus on a method of using special quadrature rules to confine spurious pollution effects, such as excess diffusion and non-physical oscillations, to layers. In particular, we indicate that Radau and Lobatto quadrature are useful for, respectively, convection-diffusion and reaction-diffusion systems. With large errors confined to small regions, an adaptive technique can successfully improve accuracy. The quadrature approach is suitable for use with adaptive methods that both adjust meshes and vary method orders. We describe the key aspects of such an adaptive strategy and present several applications. We also demonstrate an equivalence between the quadrature-based methods and a generalized Galerkin least-squares stabilization.

A quadtree-structured mesh is generated by embedding the domain in a square universe that may be recursively bisected into smaller squares called "quadrants."

Reference-contexts: Diffusion can be added implicitly through, e.g., directional differencing [32] or explicitly through, e.g., least-squares stabilization [17, 31]. Adaptive approaches automatically refine and coarsen computational meshes (h-refinement) [12, 16, 21], vary method orders (p-refinement) <ref> [6, 20, 35] </ref>, and/or move meshes (r-refinement) [29] to solve differential problems to prescribed levels of accuracy with minimal resources (x6). The method typically begins with a trial solution computed on a coarse mesh with a low-order method. <p> Most computational techniques for singularly perturbed differential systems involve first- or second-order methods. Higher-order methods have several advantages when either used alone or with adaptivity. The combination of mesh refinement/coarsening with order variation (hp-refinement) is remarkably efficient and capable of achieving exponential rates of convergence <ref> [6, 35, 39] </ref>. With complex, multi-dimensional problems, higher-order methods offer the only reasonable approach of achieving high accuracy.

A Petrov-Galerkin scheme such as (2.23) would require a major re-coding effort to incorporate into a state-of-the-art adaptive finite element software system (cf., e.g., Adjerid et al. <ref> [6] </ref>). This effort would, furthermore, have to be duplicated for different singular perturbations. A successful strategy expounded by Hughes and collaborators in the United States [31] and Johnson and colleagues in Sweden [17] adds least squares terms proportional to residuals in subintervals. <p> Perhaps a similar procedure could be developed to further reduce the oscillations associated with higher-order approximations. 6.

With either triangular- or quadrilateral-element meshes, h-refinement proceeds by further bisecting or pruning quadrants, enforcing a one-level tree difference, and generating a new mesh locally for triangles. A finite element problem is constructed from (6.1) using Galerkin's method <ref> [6] </ref>. In two-dimensions, the finite element basis is the extension of (2.9, 2.10) to triangles or quadrilaterals [39]. P-refinement proceeds by locally increasing or decreasing the polynomial degree.

Reference-contexts: Utilizing a hierarchical framework [39], the quadrature rules are designed to integrate products of exponential and polynomial functions to high order. In this regard, they bear some relationship to exponentially-weighted Petrov-Galerkin methods <ref> [27] </ref>; however, polynomials are used for both the finite element trial and test spaces.

Van Veldhuizen [40] established the stability of Radau quadrature for convection-diffusion problems associated with two-point boundary value problems. <p> The spurious oscillations can be eliminated from a convection-diffusion system by introducing a directional bias that effectively adds dissipation to the system by enlarging boundary layers to an O (h) width. Schemes for accomplishing this abound (cf., e.g., Il'in [32]); however, Hemker's <ref> [27] </ref> Petrov-Galerkin formulation has a generality that best suits our aims. <p> With this definition, we readily show <ref> [27] </ref> that v (t) = B (G (t; ); v); 8v 2 H 1 :(2.22) A Petrov-Galerkin problem is distinguished from a Galerkin problem by having differing trial and test spaces. <p> Satisfying one option usually leads to the other; however, trial and test functions differ significantly for non-self-adjoint singular perturbation problems.

Hughes's <ref> [30] </ref> approach only requires a change of quadrature rule and is, thus, simpler to implement than a Petrov-Galerkin method. Piecewise-polynomial bases (2.14) are used for both trial and test spaces and the technique may be extended to higher-order approximations and other than convection-diffusion problems. 3. <p> Setting p = 1 and using (3.4, 3.5) with ^ 1 () given by (2.29) and ^ OE 1 () given by (2.12) leads to Hughes' <ref> [30] </ref> one-point quadrature rule (2.34).

In two-dimensions, the finite element basis is the extension of (2.9, 2.10) to triangles or quadrilaterals <ref> [39] </ref>. P-refinement proceeds by locally increasing or decreasing the polynomial degree. Interelement continuity is imposed by requiring polynomials on either side of an element's edge to have the higher degree of the pair [6].

Reference-contexts: In this regard, they bear some relationship to exponentially-weighted Petrov-Galerkin methods [27]; however, polynomials are used for both the finite element trial and test spaces. The singular perturbation limit of the derived quadrature rules for convection-diffusion systems are Radau integration formulas. Van Veldhuizen <ref> [40] </ref> established the stability of Radau quadrature for convection-diffusion problems associated with two-point boundary value problems. We also show that Lobatto quadrature yields stable results for reaction-diffusion problems for all combinations of the singular perturbation parameter, the mesh spacing, and the order of the method.

Reference-contexts: Error estimates based on this principle have been shown to converge at the same rate as the exact errors under mesh refinement for elliptic <ref> [41, 42] </ref> and parabolic problems [3, 4]. These error estimates are computationally simple and are obtained by solving either element-level parabolic or elliptic problems. Solving elemental elliptic problems utilizes a temporal superconvergence and is the simpler of the two procedures.
