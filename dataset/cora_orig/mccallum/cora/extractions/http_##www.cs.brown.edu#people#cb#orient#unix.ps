Reference-contexts: For a more comprehensive introduction to UNIX, look at some of the many books that are now available and the SunOS documentation. I like <ref> [Kernighan & Pike] </ref> myself, though it's now a little dated and it has a slight System V flavor. The UNIX operating system has developed in two distinct directions: System V from AT&T and BSD from Berkeley. SunOS 4.1.3 is a BSD descendant.

Its user functionality encompasses everything other Emacs editors do, and it is easily extensible since its editing commands are written in Lisp. In recent years several different groups have become tired of GNU's slowness in producing new versions, and have come out with their own.
