Abstract: We simulate a multiagent market with production, consumption, and exchange mediated by a sealed-bid double auction. Marked price bubbles and subsequent crashes occur when value-based (fundamentals-driven) and trend-based traders are both present, and the market equilibrium price is ramped up exogenously. Similarly, negative price bubbles and recoveries occur when the equilibrium price is ramped down. Because the simulated market is auction-mediated, we can observe the operations of traders during these events, and study the interactions that produce and resolve bubbles. Some preliminary circuit-breaker experiments are described, in which bubbles are interrupted during their formation.

Reference-contexts: We mention several recent papers that are closely related to this work, and which add to accumulating evidence that heterogeneity of agents can produce significant endogenous price movements in a variety of market types. Arthur et al. <ref> [1] </ref> describe a model and simulations in which heterogeneous agents in the Santa Fe Artificial Stock Market [8] adapt to each other's behavior using a genetic algorithm. They argue that deductive reasoning fails with heterogeneous traders, forcing the agents to use inductive reasoning.

Reference-contexts: In [4], Brock and Hommes discuss adaptive belief systems in a simple present-value asset pricing model and arrive at similar conclusions. Different bifurcation routes to complicated price fluctuations are observed with different types of traders in the market. Bak, Paczuski, and Shubik <ref> [2] </ref> construct simple models of stock markets, including traders with imitating behavior.

Reference-contexts: In <ref> [3] </ref>, Brock and Hommes study a cobweb-type demand-supply model in which agents can choose between naive expectations that have zero cost, and rational expectations with positive information costs. They show that a high propensity for switching in this model leads to highly irregular equilibrium prices converging to a strange attractor.

Reference-contexts: Their dynamic model captures an "interplay between fundamentalists and positive feedback trading and the relevance to the formation and breaking of bubbles [13], p. 5." Caginalp and Balenovitch <ref> [5] </ref> also construct a differential equation that reflects the operation of both fundamentalist and trend-chasing traders. Their work is similar to that in [13] in that it is aggregate, and does not model actual exchange, but assumes that prices move in response to buy and sell pressures. <p> We can hold no reasonable hope at this point of calibrating our model with a real economic market (such as done in Caginalp and Balenovich <ref> [5] </ref>). Our model doesn't incorporate the complexity of human behavior that is evidently at work in real markets, has only the minimum number of commodities necessary for exchange (two), and is provided with no real-world data. <p> We can call the return from a negative bubble a "recovery." This terminology seems to be closest to common usage, where "bubble" almost always means a positive price excursion followed by a crash. Laboratory experiments (like [9], for example) and mathematical models (like <ref> [5] </ref> and [13], for example) concentrate on positive bubbles. In our model we observe both positive and negative price bubbles, because the trend traders sell on detecting a down-trend as readily as they buy on detecting an up-trend.

Reference-contexts: Again, we remark that the details have proven not to be critical, and this function has been chosen for simplicity and transparency. Finally, the amount bid is simply the difference between the agent's current food inventory, and his reserve level. Value traders use adaptive expectations <ref> [6] </ref> to predict the average price. The price forecast is given by F t = ffP t1 + (1 ff)F t1 (5) where F t is the forecast price at time t, and ff is a weighting coefficient.

Reference-contexts: At the same time, buying frenzy, panic, and mob psychology are widely accepted as a fundamental cause of large price swings in the absence of exogenous perturbations. Charles Mackay reflects the popular wisdom in his description of the Dutch tulipmania of the 1630's <ref> [7] </ref>: Nobles, citizens, farmers, mechanics, seamen, footmen, maid-servants, even chimney-sweeps and old clotheswomen, dabbled in tulips. People of all grades converted their property into cash, and invested it in flowers.

The model adjusts market price when a buyer or seller "wakes up" by a proportionate price movement in the appropriate direction. <p> We can call the return from a negative bubble a "recovery."

Reference-contexts: As we show in [11], the value traders increase overall productivity, even after their profit is accounted for. The more efficient division of labor is, after all, the source of the "wealth of nations" identified by Adam Smith <ref> [10] </ref>. 5 Trend traders 5.1 Trend-based trading strategy We next introduce trend-based traders, who are intended to model the behavior of traders motivated by price movement alone, rather than any estimate of fundamental value.

Reference-contexts: They show in yet another context that the interaction of fundamental value buyers and noise traders can result in large price variations not justified by fundamental market analysis. 2 The minimal market 2.1 Outline Our starting point is the market described in <ref> [11] </ref>, and the reader is referred to that source for details. <p> The algorithm we have implemented is dominated in asymptotic time complexity by the time required to sort the lists of critical points, and in practice runs in time almost linear in the number of critical points, which is in 1 This is a variation of the auction in <ref> [11] </ref>, where volume of exchanged food is maximized. Maximizing gold volume seems more consistent with the incentives of an auctioneer, who might well receive commissions based on sales volume in gold. <p> At this point the auction for the current trading period concludes and a new trading period starts. 2.3 Bidding functions The algorithm that determines the bids of value traders is exactly as given in <ref> [11] </ref>, and we give it here for completeness. Each agent's particular bid is determined by multiplying his bidding function by the most recent auction closing price, P t1 , the result of yesterday's auction, which is known to everyone. <p> Another principle we have adopted: We develop more complicated systems by building on simpler ones. Thus, we first make sure that the system with only regular agents behaves as expected (it oscillates strongly), then that the addition of value traders stabilizes the price to a large extent <ref> [11] </ref>. Only then do we dare add trend traders. 4 Value traders and a baseline economy In keeping with our intent to build from simpler to more complex systems, we begin with a baseline economy, which consists of regular agents and only value traders. <p> As mentioned earlier, the simulation algorithm is the same as that described in <ref> [11] </ref>, except that the auction has been re-coded to maximize gold instead of food volume. The results are very similar. Figure 4 shows the history of the auction closing price, with value traders added at the 500th trading period. <p> Thus the "intelligence" is allocated to the value traders, who forecast the price using an exponential smoothing algorithm, and who stabilize the price, and create a liquid market where agents can better specialize in the activity of higher skill. As we show in <ref> [11] </ref>, the value traders increase overall productivity, even after their profit is accounted for. <p> With all its difficulties and subtleties, the field of multiagent simulation is nevertheless emerging as a flexible and powerful tool for studying economic phenomena, complementary to | and in some sense between | theory and laboratory experiment. 10 Acknowledgements The authors are first of all indebted to the co-authors of <ref> [11] </ref>, Leonard Cohen and Mike Honig.

Reference-contexts: Quite naturally, the volume, shown in closeup in Fig. 6, behaves in a way highly correlated with price. Note that there are two brief periods when the price and volume are both absolutely constant. The general behavior is reminiscent of the results reported by Youssefmir and Huberman <ref> [12] </ref>, who simulate large systems of agents who switch strategies to compete for limited resources.

Reference-contexts: It was seen that somebody must lose fearfully in the end. As this conviction spread, prices fell, and never rose again. Confidence was destroyed, and a universal panic seized upon the dealers. Youssefmir, Huberman, and Hogg <ref> [13] </ref> provide a good review of recent economic literature concerning price bubbles. They point out the difficulty in explaining bubbles within the standard rational expectations theory, and go on to adopt the "noisy trader" approach, modeling the formation of bubbles with trend-chasing traders. <p> Their dynamic model captures an "interplay between fundamentalists and positive feedback trading and the relevance to the formation and breaking of bubbles <ref> [13] </ref>, p. 5." Caginalp and Balenovitch [5] also construct a differential equation that reflects the operation of both fundamentalist and trend-chasing traders.

The model adjusts market price when a buyer or seller "wakes up" by a proportionate price movement in the appropriate direction. <p> et al. point out, their model is limited because they have not "incorporated the notion of variations in volume as determining current prices nor do we have any auction mechanism to mediate the purchase or selling of assets." The main aim of our paper is to extend the results in <ref> [13] </ref> to a market simulation in which trade is mediated in a central auction. Three kinds of agents will operate: consumer-producers (whom we term regular agents), fundamentalist traders (whom we term value traders), and speculators (whom we term trend traders). <p> We can call the return from a negative bubble a "recovery." This terminology seems to be closest to common usage, where "bubble" almost always means a positive price excursion followed by a crash.

In our model we observe both positive and negative price bubbles, because the trend traders sell on detecting a down-trend as readily as they buy on detecting an up-trend.
