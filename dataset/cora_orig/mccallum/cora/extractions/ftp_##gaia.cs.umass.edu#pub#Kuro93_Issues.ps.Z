Abstract: In this paper we identify the challenges and open issues involved in providing quality-of-service (QOS) guarantees to sessions in a high-speed wide area network and briefly survey research in this area. Four approaches towards providing QOS guarantees are described and discussed: the tightly controlled approach, the approximate approach, the bounding approach, and the observation-based approach.

Reference-contexts: With real-time communication, a statistical guarantee might promise that no more than x% of the cells would experience a delay greater than D [18]. With cell loss, a statistical guarantee might be that no more than x% of the cells in the session are lost <ref> [1] </ref>. Among statistical guarantees, a distinction is also made between guarantees made in a steady state sense, and guarantees which are defined over specific intervals of time. <p> However, if the session duration is finite, there is some probability that the guarantee would be violated. Markovian performance models, such as those in <ref> [28, 10, 1] </ref>, typically fall within the category of statistical guarantees based on an infinite horizon model. <p> The results indicate that even at high utilization, the delays provided by stop and go queueing can be significantly larger than under the uncontrolled case. 3.2 Approximate approaches In approximate approaches toward providing QOS guarantees <ref> [28, 10, 1, 9] </ref>, traffic sources at the network's edge (and within the network) are characterized by relatively simple models. <p> An example of such a source model is the on/off source, which alternates between on-periods (during which cells are typically generated periodically) and off-periods (during which no cells are generated) <ref> [28, 1, 19] </ref>. In order to determine whether or not the multiplexed sources will receive their required QOS, the queueing behavior of the multiplexed traffic streams is then analyzed. In [1, 9], the QOS measure of interest is packet loss; in [10] the measure of interest is maximum delay. <p> In order to determine whether or not the multiplexed sources will receive their required QOS, the queueing behavior of the multiplexed traffic streams is then analyzed. In <ref> [1, 9] </ref>, the QOS measure of interest is packet loss; in [10] the measure of interest is maximum delay. Approximate approaches toward QOS guarantees have both advantages and disadvantages over the tightly controlled approaches. Perhaps their most important advantage is their simplicity, which makes them well-suited for real-time, on-line implementation. <p> Approximate approaches toward QOS guarantees have both advantages and disadvantages over the tightly controlled approaches. Perhaps their most important advantage is their simplicity, which makes them well-suited for real-time, on-line implementation. For example, the call admission control mechanism based on the approximate QOS scheme described in <ref> [1] </ref> can make a QOS computation (to determine whether or not to admit a call, given its QOS requirements and existing QOS guarantees) with a very small number of additions and multiplications. <p> There are, however, several potential disadvantages. The first is the fact that the approaches are, as their name suggests, approximate. Empirical evidence in <ref> [1] </ref> indicates that the QOS computations for certain well-defined sources tend to be conservative, thus providing a guarantee on performance. However, the conservative nature of the approximations has yet to be formally demonstrated, except in certain limiting cases [9].

Reference-contexts: not satisfied, no bound can be computed, even though it may be known (via traditional queueing analysis) that the queues themselves are indeed all stable (e.g., the expected delay at all queues is finite). 3.4 Observation-Based Approaches The final set of approaches toward providing QOS guarantees are the observation-based approaches <ref> [11, 17, 12, 4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Recently, Parekh and Gallager [22, 23] have developed a methodology for providing deterministic guarantees under a work-conserving queueing discipline known as packetized generalized processor sharing, PGPS (referred to as the weighted fair queueing discipline in <ref> [8] </ref>). In a network setting, this queueing discipline permits the analysis of the performance bound for a multi-hop session to be collapsed to the analysis of a single hop, considerably simplifying the analysis and also significantly tightening the bounds obtained via [7].

Perhaps the most important outstanding research issue for both the statistical and the deterministic bounding approaches is their reliance on the ability to bound the maximum length of each queue's busy period for a given set of traffic specifications.

Reference-contexts: An example of such a source model is the on/off source, which alternates between on-periods (during which cells are typically generated periodically) and off-periods (during which no cells are generated) <ref> [28, 1, 19] </ref>. In order to determine whether or not the multiplexed sources will receive their required QOS, the queueing behavior of the multiplexed traffic streams is then analyzed. In [1, 9], the QOS measure of interest is packet loss; in [10] the measure of interest is maximum delay. <p> A final potential concern is that traffic models, whether at the source or deep within the network, require some form of Markovian assumptions. While traffic at the edge of the network may be reasonably well-approximated by such models <ref> [19] </ref>, it is still unknown whether this is also true for a session's traffic when it is deep within the network, having passed through several multiplexers.

A final open research issue that arises both with approximate approaches as well as with many of the approaches described in the following subsections is that the guarantees provided are local guarantees, i.e., performance guarantees provided to a session at a single multiplexing point.

Reference-contexts: of five minute intervals in the steady state model have a loss probability exceeding 10 3 even though the steady state loss probability is less than 10 3 .) Interval-based QOS guarantees have also recently been proposed as part of a flow specification in an Internet Request for Comment (RFC) <ref> [24] </ref>. Characterizing performance (and thus providing QOS guarantees) in BISDN networks poses a considerable challenge for several reasons. First, sources of traffic such as packetized voice and video exhibit correlated, time-varying behavior that is significantly more complex than that of traditional data network sources.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, these networks will have to do so while providing a guaranteed performance or quality-of-service (QOS) to many of these traffic classes. The ability to guarantee performance is particularly important in networks supporting real-time applications <ref> [26] </ref>. The actual QOS performance metrics of interest are likely to vary from one application to another, but are projected to include such measures as cell loss, delay, and delay jitter guarantees.

Reference-contexts: In section 3, we overview four basic approaches for providing QOS guarantees. Section 4 concludes this paper. 2 QOS guarantees: Definitions and fundamental challenges Several different ways of categorizing QOS guarantees may be identified. In <ref> [27] </ref>, a distinction is made between deterministic guarantees and statistical guarantees. In the deterministic case, guarantees provide a bound on the performance of all cells (packets) within a session. <p> Tightly controlled approaches In the tightly controlled approaches toward providing QOS guarantees, a non-work conserving multiplexing (queueing) discipline insures that an individual session's output traffic characteristics (i.e., after being multiplexed with other sessions at a switch output port) are the same as that session's input traffic characteristics (i.e., before multiplexing) <ref> [16, 27, 13, 14, 7] </ref>. An example of a tightly-controlled approach is the so-called stop-and-go queueing discipline [13, 14].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Unlike traditional data networks, future broadband-ISDN (BISDN) wide-area networks will be required to carry a broad range of traffic classes ranging from bursty, variable-rate sources, such as voice and variable-rate coded video, to smooth, constant bit rate sources <ref> [28] </ref>. Moreover, these networks will have to do so while providing a guaranteed performance or quality-of-service (QOS) to many of these traffic classes. The ability to guarantee performance is particularly important in networks supporting real-time applications [26]. <p> The problem here then is one of performance-oriented call admission control <ref> [28] </ref>. We note that this problem is distinct from (but in some respects dependent upon) the lower-level controls (such as flow/congestion control and cell discarding policy) which are applied to the individual cells or bursts within the traffic streams of already-accepted calls. <p> However, if the session duration is finite, there is some probability that the guarantee would be violated. Markovian performance models, such as those in <ref> [28, 10, 1] </ref>, typically fall within the category of statistical guarantees based on an infinite horizon model. <p> The results indicate that even at high utilization, the delays provided by stop and go queueing can be significantly larger than under the uncontrolled case. 3.2 Approximate approaches In approximate approaches toward providing QOS guarantees <ref> [28, 10, 1, 9] </ref>, traffic sources at the network's edge (and within the network) are characterized by relatively simple models. <p> An example of such a source model is the on/off source, which alternates between on-periods (during which cells are typically generated periodically) and off-periods (during which no cells are generated) <ref> [28, 1, 19] </ref>. In order to determine whether or not the multiplexed sources will receive their required QOS, the queueing behavior of the multiplexed traffic streams is then analyzed. In [1, 9], the QOS measure of interest is packet loss; in [10] the measure of interest is maximum delay.

Reference-contexts: In the deterministic case, guarantees provide a bound on the performance of all cells (packets) within a session. For example, with real-time traffic, a deterministic guarantee might be that no cells would be delayed more that D time units on an end-to-end basis <ref> [29] </ref>. With cell loss as a performance metric, the deterministic guarantee might be that no cell loss occurs [16, 13, 14, 6, 7, 15]. Statistical guarantees promise that no more than a specified fraction of cells will see performance below a certain specified value.
