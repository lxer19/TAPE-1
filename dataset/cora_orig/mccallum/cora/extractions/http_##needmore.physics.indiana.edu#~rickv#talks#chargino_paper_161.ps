Title: Search for Chargino and Neutralino Production in e e Collisions at p The OPAL Collaboration  
Date: October 1996  
Note: EUROPEAN LABORATORY FOR PARTICLE PHYSICS CERN-PPE/96-135 4th  136 GeV. Submitted to Physics Letters B  
Abstract: Charginos and neutralinos, predicted by supersymmetric theories, have been searched for in e + e collisions with an integrated luminosity of 10:0 pb 1 at a centre-of-mass energy of p s =161 GeV with the OPAL detector at LEP. Two candidate events are selected; consistent with the total background estimate of 0:7 0:2 events. The 95% C.L. lower limit on the lightest chargino mass in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model is 78.5 GeV if the universal scalar mass m 0 is greater than 1 TeV, and 62.0 GeV for the smallest m 0 compatible with slepton and sneutrino mass limits obtained at centre-of-mass energies near the Z peak. These limits were obtained under the conditions that the lightest chargino is heavier than the lightest neutralino by more than 10 GeV and tan fi = 1:5. The new exclusion limits significantly improve on the results obtained at p

Reference-contexts: This provided an opportunity to search for new particles in this new energy region. In this publication we report on a direct search for charginos and neutralinos predicted in supersymmetric (SUSY) theories <ref> [1] </ref> using the data collected with the OPAL detector at p s =161 GeV. We obtain improved exclusion limits compared to the previous results from the analysis of data near the Z peak (LEP1) and at p at LEP by the OPAL [2] and other LEP collaborations [3].

Reference-contexts: We obtain improved exclusion limits compared to the previous results from the analysis of data near the Z peak (LEP1) and at p at LEP by the OPAL <ref> [2] </ref> and other LEP collaborations [3]. Similar but more model-dependent limits were also obtained by the CDF and D0 collaborations at the Tevatron [4]. <p> Data were used from runs in which all the subdetectors relevant to this analysis were fully operational, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 10:0 pb 1 . To select good charged tracks and clusters in the calorimeters, quality requirements similar to those in Ref. <ref> [2] </ref> were applied 3 . Calculations of experimental variables were performed using the four-momenta of tracks and of EM or HCAL clusters not associated with charged tracks 4 . <p> The previous limits obtained at 130 and 136 GeV <ref> [2] </ref> are combined with the limits at 161 GeV as shown in the figures, assuming that the cross-sections are proportional to ~ fi=s, where ~ fi is the momentum of the final state ~ + 1 or ~ 0 2 in the centre-of-mass system. <p> The region of M 2 excluded is close to the kinematical boundary for chargino production if m 0 is 1 TeV, and is improved significantly with respect to the LEP1.5 result <ref> [2] </ref> for the light-m 0 scenario.

Reference-contexts: In each case, the index j or i is ordered by increasing mass. Throughout this paper, the lightest neutralino, ~ 0 1 , is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle and is therefore stable and invisible if R-parity is conserved. We used the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) <ref> [5] </ref> to guide the analysis but more general cases are also studied. If charginos are light enough, they can be pair-produced in e + e collisions through fl or Z exchange in the s-channel and through sneutrino (~-) exchange in the t-channel.

Reference-contexts: The sfermion spectrum is further constrained by assuming soft symmetry breaking at the Grand Unification (GUT) scale with a common mass scale m 0 (defined at the GUT scale) <ref> [26] </ref>. A light m 0 results in low values of the masses of the ~- and ~ `, thereby enhancing t-channel exchange diagrams that may have destructive interference with s-channel diagrams, reducing the cross-section for chargino production.
