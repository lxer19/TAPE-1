Title: The Crust and the fi-Skeleton: Combinatorial Curve Reconstruction  
Author: Nina Amenta Marshall Bern David Eppstein 
Date: December 2, 1997  
Abstract: We construct a graph on a planar point set, which captures its shape in the following sense: if a smooth curve is sampled densely enough, the graph on the samples is a polygonalization of the curve, with no extraneous edges. The required sampling density varies with the Local Feature Size on the curve, so that areas of less detail can be sampled less densely. We give two different graphs that, in this sense, reconstruct smooth curves: a simple new construction which we call the crust, and the fi-skeleton, using a specific value of fi.

Reference-contexts: We have recently become aware of two concurrent independent research efforts related to ours. Attali <ref> [A97] </ref> proves that uniformly sampled curves can be reconstructed by (essentially) the above-mentioned family of fl-neighborhood graphs. She requires 5 the sampling density be everywhere great enough to resolve the finest detail of the curve.

Reference-contexts: The main open question is the polygonal reconstruction of two-dimensional surfaces in R 3 .

Neither of our planar graphs gives a polygonal reconstruction when generalized to R 3 in a straightforward way, although it seems possible that either idea could be elaborated into a working algorithm. Many questions remain about two-dimensional reconstruction.

Reference-contexts: Our crust is an A-shape for which A is the set of Voronoi vertices. A-shapes for other choices of A may also have interesting provable properties. 4 The Medial Axis In this section we review the definition of the medial axis <ref> [B67] </ref>, and prove some useful lemmata about it. The medial axis can be thought of as the Voronoi diagram generalized to an infinite set of input points.

Reference-contexts: The closest line of research concerns shape recognition for computer vision. The emphasis there is on the closely related problem of estimating the medial axis from a set of boundary points. Brandt and Algazi <ref> [BA92] </ref> showed that the Delaunay triangulation of a sufficiently dense set of samples contains a reconstruction of the boundary as a subset of its edges (a slightly weaker version of our Theorem 12). <p> The Delaunay triangulation of the set S of samples contains an edge between every adjacent pair of samples. Proof: Implied immediately by Lemma 11 and the Empty Circle Property. 2 Note: Brandt and Algazi <ref> [BA92] </ref> also show that adjacent points on a densely sampled curve are separated by a Voronoi edge (the dual statement of Theorem 12). Let d fl be the minimum, over all points p 2 F , of LF S (p). <p> The comparison is not really fair here, since our graphs also reconstruct some curves with branches and endpoints. An algorithm that produced only reconstructions of smooth closed curves could perhaps get by with a larger value of r. The work in [RCGH92], <ref> [BA92] </ref>, [O94], dealt with the polygonal analog of the medial axis, consisting of those edges of the Voronoi diagram of S whose dual Delau-nay edges do not belong to the polygonal reconstruction of the boundary; see Figure 15. One can think of this graph as the anti-crust.

Reference-contexts: Proof: Similar to Corollary 3. 2 The following objects were defined by Chew <ref> [C93] </ref>, from whom we borrow the idea of polygonalizing a curve using empty disks centered on the boundary. We take responsibility for the names. Definition: A Curve Voronoi Disk is a maximal disk, empty of sample points, centered at a point of the curve.

Reference-contexts: A successful earlier computational geometric approach to defining the shape of a set of points is the ff-shape, introduced by Edelsbrunner, Kirkpatrick and Seidel <ref> [EKS83] </ref>, and studied extensively by Edelsbrunner and others. The ff-shape is a simplicial complex defined on a set of points in arbitrary dimension d; each k d + 1 points are connected into a (k 1)-simplex if they touch an empty ball of radius 1=ff.

Reference-contexts: We show that under fairly generous and well-defined sampling conditions either of two proximity-based graphs defined on the set of points is guaranteed to reconstruct a smooth curve. These two graphs are the crust, which we define below, and the fi-skeleton, defined ten years ago by Kirkpatrick and Radke <ref> [KR88] </ref>, with an appropriately chosen value of fi. by hand. Notice that fewer samples are required on the goose's back than on its head and foot. fl Computer Sciences, University of Texas, Austin, TX 78712. <p> Examples of the forbidden region for different values of fi are shown in Figure 3. Reasonable definitions for fi 1 can also be made; see <ref> [KR88] </ref>. Definition: Let S be a finite set of points in the plane. An edge between s 1 ; s 2 2 S belongs to the fi-skeleton of S if the forbidden region of s 1 ; s 2 is empty. <p> But ff-shapes are often unsatisfying for reconstructing surfaces; the user needs to find the correct value of the threshold ff, and the same ff has to apply to the whole data set. In this paper we continue the study of the fi-skeleton, which was defined by Kirk-patrick and Radke <ref> [KR88] </ref>. Up until now it has been assumed that the parameter fi, like ff, needs to be found by the user. For our reconstruction problem, we give a value for fi which is guaranteed to work when S meets the sampling condition.

Reference-contexts: She requires 5 the sampling density be everywhere great enough to resolve the finest detail of the curve. Our results are better in that they allow the sampling density to vary along with the level of detail. Melkemi <ref> [Mel97] </ref> defines an A-shape on a set S of points as follows: let S 0 be the union of S with an arbitrary set of points A. An edge of the Delaunay triangulation of S 0 belongs to the A-shape if both of its endpoints belong to S.
