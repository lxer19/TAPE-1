Reference-contexts: When executing, the intended KA provides 4 through the communications layers and become part of the agent's world model. The communication layer is implemented using the Inter-Language Unification (ILU) system <ref> [1] </ref>, which is compatible with the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). The agent's knowledge areas are responsible for generating the messages to other agents. 5 a blueprint for action, specifying what the TPA should do to achieve its goals within the current context of beliefs.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The University of Michigan Digital Library (UMDL) project <ref> [2] </ref> is a large-scale, multidisciplinary effort to design and build a flexible, scalable infrastructure for rendering library services in a digital networked environment. <p> It can also talk to several UIAs at the same time, interleaving the different conversations and handling messages as they arrive. The current working prototype can be accessed at <ref> [2] </ref>. This implementation served to verify the effectiveness of our agent architecture and the use of UM-PRS as a basic platform for developing software agents.

Reference-contexts: Second, we must specify the language that the agent uses for communicating with other agents. In the UMDL, all agents are required to communicate, at the highest level, in a KQML-based language <ref> [4] </ref>. This language supports the fundamental requirement of agents to be able to convey descriptions of what they can do, without which registration and team formation cannot occur.

Reference-contexts: the TPA architecture that we have developed will be able to support the construction of a wide variety of TPAs. 2.1.1 TPA architecture The basic TPA architecture has been implemented following the Beliefs, Desires and Intentions (BDI) paradigm [10], and using the University of Michigan Procedural Reasoning System (UM-PRS) platform <ref> [7] </ref>. This approach was deemed appropriate because of the type of tasks we expect a TPA to perform.

Reference-contexts: However, it is our hope and expectation that the TPA architecture that we have developed will be able to support the construction of a wide variety of TPAs. 2.1.1 TPA architecture The basic TPA architecture has been implemented following the Beliefs, Desires and Intentions (BDI) paradigm <ref> [10] </ref>, and using the University of Michigan Procedural Reasoning System (UM-PRS) platform [7].
