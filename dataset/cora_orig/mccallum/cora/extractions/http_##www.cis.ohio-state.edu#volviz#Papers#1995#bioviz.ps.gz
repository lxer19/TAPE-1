Abstract: Slicing operation is a most powerful and useful tool for the exploration of volume data. In the core of the slicing algorithm is a resampling process that produces a set of new samples constituting the new slice. Reconstruction is imperative whenever an image or a volume needs to be resampled as a result of an af fine or perspective transformation, texture mapping, or volume slicing. Traditionally, this reconstruction is performed by using trilin-ear or cubic interpolation. However these methods suf fer from significant blurring in the resulting images and have no way to guarantee some error level at every pixel. We employ a new method for the characterization and measurement of reconstruction error that is based on spatial domain error analysis. We provide an efficient way to guarantee an error bound at every point by varying the filter size. Our approach supports also position-adaptive and data-adaptive reconstruction which adjust filter size to the location of reconstruc tion and the data in its vicinity.

Reference-contexts: The resulting slices are then composited from front to back to produce the f inal image [2][4]. The main advantage of this approach to volume rendering is the availability of texture mapping hardware (i.e., the Reality Engine <ref> [1] </ref>) that can bring the whole process of volume rendering into the realm of real-time rendering. 2 The volumes we deal with are in the form of a regular rectilinear grid or a mesh of sampled function values termed voxels.

Reference-contexts: However, none of the proposed measures are well suited for determining the accuracy of an interpolation or f iltering scheme on a sampled dataset. Carlbom on the other hand takes into consideration the error incurred by an interpolation filter while designing optimal filters <ref> [2] </ref>. However, this error is defined in the frequency domain and only measures the deviation of the frequency spectrum from the ideal spectrum. Also, this metric is global in nature and does not provide error control on a point-wise basis.

Each point on this region is mapped to the volume by the transformation S where the points are interpolated.

Reference-contexts: The result is a interpolated voxel value for each resampling point. The advantage of this slicing implementation over others is in its ability to control the resampling scheme. A further optimization is obtained if the zero-phase property of Equation 1 is not used <ref> [21] </ref>. We use a neighborhood of size 2M along each dimension instead in a fashion similar to what is done with cubic convolution filters. To use the adaptive schemes of Section 4.1 we use a derivative Equation 8 to determine the filter size.

Reference-contexts: Interpolation is the reconstruction method of choice in all the aforementioned algorithms [2][4][8][9][24]. Reconstruction in the target space is much rarer and is conducted through the use of reconstruction kernels <ref> [22] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The result is a interpolated voxel value for each resampling point. The advantage of this slicing implementation over others is in its ability to control the resampling scheme. A further optimization is obtained if the zero-phase property of Equation 1 is not used <ref> [21] </ref>. We use a neighborhood of size 2M along each dimension instead in a fashion similar to what is done with cubic convolution filters. To use the adaptive schemes of Section 4.1 we use a derivative Equation 8 to determine the filter size.

Reference-contexts: Interpolation is the reconstruction method of choice in all the aforementioned algorithms [2][4][8][9][24]. Reconstruction in the target space is much rarer and is conducted through the use of reconstruction kernels <ref> [22] </ref>. Both forms of reconstruction are equivalent and in this paper we shall examine reconstruction in terms of function interpolation.

Reference-contexts: The true error can be computed for spatially limited signals especially, 3D volumes. However, the computation can be prohibitively expensive. We now list some tractable error bounds that can be used in practice. The results make use of physical quantities known as frequency guards in the Sampling Theory literature <ref> [26] </ref>. A frequency guard of width r, 0&lt;r<1 implies that there exists no frequency in the signal beyond rw c , where w c is the cut-off frequency.
