Abstract: This paper presents a domain-independent architecture for facilitating visual problem solving between robots or softbots and humans. The architecture defines virtual and human agents in terms of their inherent cognitive and perceptual abilities, and their weak and strong knowledge sources. It introduces a third agent, an expert assistant called teleVIA, to mediate the flow of information, facilitate cooperation, filter and cache data, and generate the appropriate visual displays. The agent architecture addresses the technical issues of using an expert assistant to coordinate perception, thought, and action, manage sensing and perception, facilitate diagnosis, and to support the collaboration between people and agents in real-time. A proof-of-concept prototype for teleoperation has been developed based on sensor data scenarios extracted from two different mobile robots. The focus of the paper is on details of the system design, which are presented with examples from the prototype implementation.

Reference-contexts: Agent Architecture As shown in Fig. 1, the agent architecture consists of three agents: the remote robot, the intelligent assistant, and the local human. These agents can be described in terms of the three fundamental dimensions of multi-agent systems as discussed by Bird <ref> (Bird 1993) </ref>, namely, distribution, heterogeneity, and autonomy.

Reference-contexts: The exception handling knowledge structure (EHKS) frame is a complex knowledge structure which allows transfer of all the information relevant to a failure situation from the robot to the local system, and is based on the analogous structure produced by the teleSFX exception handling module <ref> (Chavez 1994) </ref>. It provides failure characteristics (failure step and failure type), the sensor data leading to the fusion failure (a bodies-of-evidence frame for each sensor), and a history of the robot's exception handling behavior (one or more robot hypothesis frames).

Reference-contexts: The teleVIA system uses a blackboard architecture to observe and manage the information posted independently by the robot and human agents. Blackboards have been previously used successfully for tele-operation in the Ground Vehicle Manager's Associate project <ref> (Edwards et al. 1994) </ref>, and for high level programming and control of mobile robots in a hazardous environment (Pang & Shen 1990). However, neither of these systems places an emphasis on the integration of perceptual and problem solving capabilities of the human supervisor, as is done in teleVIA.

Reference-contexts: However, neither of these systems places an emphasis on the integration of perceptual and problem solving capabilities of the human supervisor, as is done in teleVIA. Other teleassistance systems (e.g., STRIPE <ref> (Kay & Thorpe 1993) </ref>) have similar concerns for lengthy delays in up-dating information for local and remote agents, but do not approach the problem from the standpoint of introducing an additional computational agent.

Reference-contexts: The utility of teleVIA in assisting human operators in diagnosing sensing failures at the remote site is discussed in <ref> (Murphy & Rogers 1996) </ref>. The teleVIA system uses a blackboard architecture to observe and manage the information posted independently by the robot and human agents. <p> It has a significant amount of domain-specific knowledge, and is aware of all the diagnostics that can be run on its sensor platform given symptoms of a sensing or task failure. As such, it can diagnose and recover from many instances of failures as shown in <ref> (Murphy & Hershberger 1996) </ref>. However, the robot agent does not contain general problem-solving skills, which are difficult to embed at this level as discussed in (Mur-phy & Hershberger 1996). Of the three entities in the system, the robot's cognitive knowledge is the weakest and exists only at a low level.

Reference-contexts: These responsibilities are handled by the four components of teleVIA, shown in Fig. 4. This model is based on Riecken's suggestion to integrate several different agents in order to "realize a software assistant capable of performing a broad range of tasks" <ref> (Riecken 1994) </ref>. The Attention Director handles the perceptual and attentional aspects of the assistance session. It is concerned with requesting relevant sensor data, displaying that data in the possible formats: raw, default-enhanced, or knowledge-base-enhanced, and providing attentional directives to the human supervisor.

Reference-contexts: The Strategy Selector guides the activities of both of these entities, providing high-level rules for conducting the problem solving session. Finally, the Interface Manager is used to control the human agent's view of the interactive session, and to manage the display of the presentation graphics <ref> (Rogers & Murphy 1994) </ref>. TeleVIA Implementation In order to effectively collaborate with the other two agents, the teleVIA assistant must "know" a great deal about the robotic agent, and present this information in a form compatible with the capabilities of the human agent.

Reference-contexts: Previous work in the field of diagnostic radiology has led to the development of a cognitive model of visual interaction which attempts to capture how humans focus attention on the relevant information in an image <ref> (Rogers 1995a) </ref>. This model has been used as the basis for an intelligent assistance program called VIA (Visual Interaction Assistant) which supports visual decision-making and actively modifies the image display to enhance relevant features. <p> The teleVIA blackboard is the central data structure of the collaboration among the three agents, and it is divided into logical partitions, called panels, which provide groupings of the domain knowledge that are consistent with components of the cognitive model of human visual interaction described in <ref> (Rogers 1995a) </ref>. The four general categories of context, perception, hypotheses and attention are reflected in the Current Context Panel, Interactive Exception Handling Panel, Hypotheses Panel and Attention Panel, respectively.

Reference-contexts: The blackboard-based architecture of the VIA system was chosen to facilitate the opportunistic problem-solving needed for complex and ill-structured applications. Evaluation of a preliminary prototype for radiologists, VIA-RAD, has demonstrated some promising results, both in performance and in acceptance by the users <ref> (Rogers 1995b) </ref>. We have since combined the intelligent supervisory assistance provided by the VIA system with the semi-autonomous perceptual and motor control abilities of the teleoperation version of the Sensor Fusion Effects (teleSFX) architecture for mobile robots (Mur-phy 1993) to produce teleVIA.
