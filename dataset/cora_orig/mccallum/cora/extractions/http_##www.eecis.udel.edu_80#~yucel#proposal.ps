Abstract: This dissertation proposes a new service and management architecture and its implementation for the end-to-end management of multimedia services. The underlying networking technology is a s-sumed to be Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) network, although the architecture can be a p-plied to different networking technologies. The component model that constitutes the essential el e-ments of the proposed architecture is developed and instantiated for basic core and management components, namely quality of service (QoS) and management, connection service and manag e-ment, and security service and management. A QoS approach of obtaining the service parameters from the multimedia application and/or customer and mapping them onto the components, has been utilized throughout. Component specification and design are performed using ObjectOriented Analysis and Design Methodologies, Fusion and UML. The issues related to a WEB based impl e-mentation of the prototype are addressed. The contributions and the future directions are discussed.
