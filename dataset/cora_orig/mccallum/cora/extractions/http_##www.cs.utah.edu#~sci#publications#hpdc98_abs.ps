Reference-contexts: exposing enough details to efficiently tune the application, but not too many architecturally-specific details, lest the application lose portability. 1.1 SCIRun: User Interaction and Steering a Computation To achieve execution speeds needed for interactive three-dimensional problem solving and visualization, a multi-threaded problem solving environment and computational steering system, called SCIRun <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, was built to make use of a shared memory multiprocessor, notably the SGI Power Challenge and SGI Origin 200/2000. The SCIRun scientific problem solving environment (PSE) is a computational steering system [3] that allows the interactive construction, debugging, and steering of large-scale scientific computations.

Reference-contexts: The SCIRun scientific problem solving environment (PSE) is a computational steering system <ref> [3] </ref> that allows the interactive construction, debugging, and steering of large-scale scientific computations. SCIRun can be conceptualized as a computational workbench, in which a scientist can design via a dataflow programming model and modify simulations interactively.

Reference-contexts: In this way, we can preserve existing system functionality for shared-memory executions, as well as providing more architectural flexibility. In constructing a distributed system, defined as a collection of independent computers that appear to users of the system as a single computer <ref> [4] </ref>, 2 our goal is to provide SCIRun users with the illusion of running on a single computer, while they are really utilizing several computers with very different characteristics.
