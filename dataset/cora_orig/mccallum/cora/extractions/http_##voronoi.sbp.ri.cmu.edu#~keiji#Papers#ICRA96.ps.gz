Abstract: A goal of this research is to successfully accomplish a long distance navigation task, including "Passing through a doorway", by an autonomous robot equipped with a manipulator. In our approach to this problem, we apply the concept of action primitives to the mobile manipulator control system. Action primitives are defined as unit elements of a complex behavior, such as door opening behavior. Basically, the action primitives control a robot according sequences of planned motion primitives. But as an important feature, each action primitive is designed with an error adjustment mechanism to cope with accumulated positioning error of the mobile base. In this paper, we report the design and implementation of action primitives for door opening behavior for our experimental robot, and show experimental results of an autonomous mobile manipulator's "Passing through a doorway" using sequences of designed action primitives.

Reference-contexts: There are many research approaches to mobile manipulator problems. One class of approach is to study motion control for stability of a mobile manipulator [1][2]. Another one is to design motion plans for tasks <ref> [3] </ref>, especially focusing on obstacle avoidance [4][5]. However, there has been little prior research treating a concrete and complex task such as door opening. At the beginning of this research, we divided the total behavior into several basic motions [6].

Reference-contexts: Another one is to design motion plans for tasks [3], especially focusing on obstacle avoidance [4][5]. However, there has been little prior research treating a concrete and complex task such as door opening. At the beginning of this research, we divided the total behavior into several basic motions <ref> [6] </ref>. To realize each motion, we proposed to apply an "action primitives" as the fundamental control unit for mobile manipulator control. The complex total behavior of the robot is expressed as a collection of action primitives and is realized by switching among them sequentially.

Reference-contexts: The complex total behavior of the robot is expressed as a collection of action primitives and is realized by switching among them sequentially. One of the major problems for a mobile manipulator is the accumulated positioning error of the mobile base <ref> [7] </ref>. This error seriously results in the failure of the mounted manipulator to handle objects successfully. Therefore, the robot should always be making an effort to reduce the positioning error.

Reference-contexts: In general, the positioning error is not too large. Therefore, an error reduction mechanism can be designed in a locally linear system by a differential motion model <ref> [9] </ref>. For detection of the error, the action primitive may have an environment model to compare with external sensory data. Recently, reactive control methods for robot control have receipted considerable attention (for example [10]). An advantage of this type of control is robustness errors. <p> Then the robot calculates the positioning error which is expressed as [d x d y d z ] T in the local coordinate frame (LCC) which is attached to the hand <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For detection of the error, the action primitive may have an environment model to compare with external sensory data. Recently, reactive control methods for robot control have receipted considerable attention (for example <ref> [10] </ref>). An advantage of this type of control is robustness errors. However, in our approach, motion are principally pre-planned based on the model for each action primitive, and then given as the reference value of the control.

Reference-contexts: Other four free casters support the mobile base. Twelve ultra-sonic range sensors are mounted around its body for detecting landmarks and obstacles. A light weight six degree-of-freedom manipulator <ref> [11] </ref> is mounted on the front of the mobile base. It is actuated by DC-motors, and each motor has encoders to estimate the pose of manipulator.

Reference-contexts: The trajectory and stop position are represented by a sequence of line segments with respect to a two dimensional global reference frame on the ground. The 'SPUR' command which was developed in our laboratory <ref> [12] </ref> is used for locomotion control of the mobile base. We use flat walls to adjust the position of the mobile base using ultra-sonic range sensors. The flat surface of the door provides especially important information for position adjustment to the robot's computer.

Reference-contexts: To detect the knob's position, we use a passive vision sensor system. On the image plane, the knob can be regarded as an ellipse. We compute a differential image by the Sobel operator to extract an outline of the ellipse. Then we use the Hough transform method <ref> [13] </ref> to find the ellipse position and major axis length. An example of a processed image of the knob is shown in Figure 6. The major axis length includes the distance information between the vision sensor and door knob, and the ellipse center indicates the position of the hand.

Reference-contexts: The reference position of the hand is shifted in the direction of the detected force vector on a vertical plane of the door knob. The details of the compliance control are discussed in <ref> [14] </ref>. 5 Experimental Results By combining the implemented action primitives, we have demonstrated door opening behavior using the target mobile manipulator. Experimental results for a sequence of action primitives are shown in a sequence of photos in Figure 9. 1.
