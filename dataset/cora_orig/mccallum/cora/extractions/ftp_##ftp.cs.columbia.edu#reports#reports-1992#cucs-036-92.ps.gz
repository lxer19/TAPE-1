Abstract: In this report, a detailed proof is given that for every real number r, there is a finite set F &lt;r of graphs, which are called "frames", such that every cutedge-free smooth graph whose average genus is less than r can be obtained by attaching a set of non-overlapping ears to some member of F &lt;r .

Reference-contexts: Other two easily verified facts are that the frame of a cutedge-free graph is also cutedge-free and that the frame of a smooth graph is also smooth. The following theorem is frequently applied herein, and its proof can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. Theorem 1.1 The average genus of a graph is not less than the average genus of any of its subgraphs. 2 The main theorem Notation. F &lt;r denotes the set of graphs that are frames of cutedge-free smooth graphs of average genus less than r. <p> Finally, an n-rung closed-end ladder L n is obtained by taking the graphical Cartesian product of an n-vertex path with the complete graph K 2 , and then doubling both its end edges. The proof for the following theorem can be found in <ref> [2] </ref> (Lemma 5.5 and Lemma 5.6) and [3] (Corollary 2.3). Theorem 2.5 For every sufficiently large number n, fl avg (D n ) 4 n fl avg (L n ) 3 Now we are ready for the main theorem of this section.

Reference-contexts: The objective of this section is to prove that the set F &lt;r is finite, for every real number r 0. We use Tutte's theory of bridges [6], using the slightly modified terminology introduced in <ref> [3] </ref>. The following terms are defined in x4 of [3]: vertex of attachment, trivial bridge, non-trivial bridge, smooth model. Suppose that G is a cutedge-free smooth graph and that H is a cutedge-free subgraph of G. <p> The objective of this section is to prove that the set F &lt;r is finite, for every real number r 0. We use Tutte's theory of bridges [6], using the slightly modified terminology introduced in <ref> [3] </ref>. The following terms are defined in x4 of [3]: vertex of attachment, trivial bridge, non-trivial bridge, smooth model. Suppose that G is a cutedge-free smooth graph and that H is a cutedge-free subgraph of G. We begin with three lemmas that relate the numerical difference fl avg (G) fl avg (H) to the graphical difference G H. <p> We begin with three lemmas that relate the numerical difference fl avg (G) fl avg (H) to the graphical difference G H. Similar lemmas for the category of 2-connected graphs were proven in a preceding paper <ref> [3] </ref>, and the extension of those proofs to the category of cutedge-free graphs is straightforward. Therefore, we only sketch the proofs here and refer the interested reader to [3] for supplementary details. Lemma 2.1 Let G be a cutedge-free smooth graph and H a cutedge-free subgraph of G. <p> Similar lemmas for the category of 2-connected graphs were proven in a preceding paper <ref> [3] </ref>, and the extension of those proofs to the category of cutedge-free graphs is straightforward. Therefore, we only sketch the proofs here and refer the interested reader to [3] for supplementary details. Lemma 2.1 Let G be a cutedge-free smooth graph and H a cutedge-free subgraph of G. Suppose that B is a non-trivial bridge of G H. <p> Note that the two end-vertices of P 0 may also be identical. The graph H [ fP; P 0 g is obviously cutedge-free. Moreover, as shown in the proof of Lemma 4.1 of <ref> [3] </ref>, we have fl avg (H [ fP; P 0 g) fl avg (H) 3 A chain C of a graph H (not necessarily smooth) is a simple path in H such that every interior vertex of C has valence 2 in H. <p> The graph H [ fB; B 0 g is obviously cutedge-free. In Case 1, if the two trivial bridges B and B 0 share a common attachment that is an interior vertex of a chain C in H, then as shown in the proof of Lemma 4.2 of <ref> [3] </ref>, we have fl avg (H [ fB; B 0 g) fl avg (H) 3 In Case 2, suppose that the bridge B has two different endpoints p 1 and p 2 on the chain C, and B 0 has an endpoint q between p 1 and p 2 on C <p> C 0 and B 0 are two simple paths in G H 0 such that the two endpoints of C 0 are attachments of H 0 and one of the endpoints of B 0 is at an interior vertex of C 0 , by the proof of Lemma 4.1 of <ref> [3] </ref>, we have fl avg (H 0 [ fC 0 ; B 0 g) fl avg (H 0 ) 3 Furthermore, it is obvious to see that the graph H 0 is homeomorphic to the graph H, and that H [ fB; B 0 g = H 0 [ fC 0 <p> As shown in the proof of Lemma 4.4 of <ref> [3] </ref>, if three bridges B, B 0 , and B 00 in G H link the interiors of two maximal chains in H askew, then fl avg (H [ fB; B 0 ; B 00 g) fl avg (H) 4 With these preparations, we are ready for the following crucial lemma, <p> The proof for the following theorem can be found in [2] (Lemma 5.5 and Lemma 5.6) and <ref> [3] </ref> (Corollary 2.3). Theorem 2.5 For every sufficiently large number n, fl avg (D n ) 4 n fl avg (L n ) 3 Now we are ready for the main theorem of this section.
