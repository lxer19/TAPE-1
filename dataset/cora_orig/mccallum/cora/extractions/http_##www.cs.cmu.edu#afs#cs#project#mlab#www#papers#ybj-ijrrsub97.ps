Abstract: In the absence of vision, grasping an object often relies on tactile feedback from the fingertips. As the finger pushes the object, the fingertip can feel the contact point move. From this motion the finger can infer the location of the contact point on the object and thereby the object pose. This paper primarily investigates the problem of determining the pose (orientation and position) of a planar object from such contact motion generated by pushing. A dynamic analysis of pushing yields a nonlinear system that relates through contact the object pose and motion to the finger motion. The contact motion on the fingertip thus encodes certain information about the object pose. Nonlinear observability theory is employed to show that such information is sufficient for the finger to "observe" not only the pose but also the motion of the object. Therefore a sensing strategy can be realized as an observer of the nonlinear dynamical system. Two observers are subsequently introduced. The first observer, based on the result of [14], has its "gain" determined by the solution of a Lyapunov-like equation; it can be activated at any time instant during a push. The second observer, based on Newton's method, solves for the initial (motionless) object pose from three intermediate contact points during a push. Under the Coulomb friction model, the paper copes with support friction in the plane and/or contact friction between the finger and the object. Extensive simulations have been done to demonstrate the feasibility of the two observers. Preliminary experiments (with an Adept robot) have also been conducted. Inspired by the way a human hand touches, this work may serve as a primitive step in exploring interactive sensing in grasping tasks. From a more general perspective, it presents an approach for acquiring geometric and dynamical information about a task from a small amount of tactile data, with the application of nonlinear observability theory.

Reference-contexts: Some previous work such as <ref> [5] </ref> and [23] describe pose determination algorithms that use a sufficient number of geometric constraints. A motionless finger in contact with an object imposes only two geometric constraints on the object pose: the contact location and the opposition of the fingertip and object normals at the contact.

Reference-contexts: We begin with an introduction to conventional linearization techniques in designing asymptotic Luenberger-like observers and show why they are inapplicable to the disk-polygon system. Based on the result of Gauthier et al. <ref> [14] </ref>, we later give an asymptotic observer for system (28). <p> Even if these conditions hold, it is still quite burdensome (and sometimes impossible) to find explicit solutions to partial differential equations involving repeated Lie brackets on which the desired coordinate transformation is based. Gauthier, Hammouri, and Othman <ref> [14] </ref> describe an observer for affine-control nonlinear systems whose "gain" is determined via the solution of an appropriate Lyapunov-like equation. Their observer is very simple: it is a copy of the original system, together with a linear corrective term that depends only on the state space dimension. <p> Ciccarella et al. [6] propose a similar observer whose gain vector is controlled by the properly chosen eigenvalues of a certain matrix obtained from the original system's Brunowsky canonical form, thus providing more freedom on optimizing the observer behavior. Extending the results of GHO <ref> [14] </ref>, Gau thier and Kupka [15] characterize non-affine control systems that are observable independent of their inputs and exhibit an exponential observer for them. We shall apply the GHO procedure to find an observer for the disk-polygon system (28). <p> We also show that the object pose just before pushing is almost always locally observable. These results form the underlying principles of our sensing algorithms, which essentially are observers of the nonlinear dynamical system. Based on the result of <ref> [14] </ref>, we construct an asymptotic nonlinear observer and demonstrate it by simulations. This observer is a composition of a copy of the original system with an error corrective term constructed over the system output and the solution of a Lyapunov-like equation.

The paper by Salisbury <ref> [36] </ref> proposes the concept of fingertip force sensing with an approach for determining contact locations and orientations from force and moment measurements. Fearing and Binford [12] describe determining principal curvatures, normal force, and location from strain measurements by a cylindrical tactile sensor.

Reference-contexts: The Jacobian of the inverse transformation 1 is then the inverse of the Jacobian of <ref> [37, p. 2-17] </ref>: @ 1 = B B du rdL f ! f ! C C 1 The one-form dL f ! consists of the following partial derivatives: @L f ! = 2! s 2 + 2 r g @u T ! @L f ! = (s 2 + 2 ) <p> Equations (14), (15), (9), and (10) then 39 determine the contact motion u (t). Meanwhile, it is known that fi 1 is determined, up to rotation and translation, by its curvature function fi 1 <ref> [37] </ref>. Assuming now u (t) is known but fi 1 is not, the same equations conversely determine the curvature function fi 1 , thereby the curve segment fi 1 (in its initial pose).

Reference-contexts: Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of transformation (32) for autonomous nonlinear systems without input are given in [25], and in [26] by Krener and Respondek along with a constructive algorithm. Conditions and constructive algorithms are also presented for systems with/without inputs by Xia and Gao <ref> [38] </ref>. These constructive algorithms find proper changes of coordinates from explicit solutions to certain partial differential equations involving repeated Lie brackets; hence their applicability is quite limited. In particular, the following theorem defines the class of nonlinear systems with single outputs that can be subjected to linearization by output injection.

Reference-contexts: This argument suggests that three intermediate contact positions suffice for computing s 0 in most cases, which will be demonstrated later by the simulation results. This observer is for the system given by (7)-(10) in which the fingers and the object have general planar shapes. Zimmer <ref> [39] </ref> presented a state estimator that conducts on-line minimization over some objective function. His observer, with provable convergence, iteratively uses Newton's method to modify its state estimate every fixed period of time.
