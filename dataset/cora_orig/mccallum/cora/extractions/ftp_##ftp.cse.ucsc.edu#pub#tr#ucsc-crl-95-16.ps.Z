Abstract: also be caused by off-site communications failures, ranging from temporary routing failures to problems with the physical communications links. We have not attempted to characterize the causes of failure, though it seems that most failures are brief and are probably caused by software faults or voluntary reboots. Many studies have assumed that failure and repair followed Poisson processes, that is, that the distributions for TTF and TTR were exponential. This assumption is often made more for analytic simplicity than out of a conviction that it is the best model of reality. For example, some analyses of replication protocols using Markov models [P---ris86, Long89] depend on that assumption. We investigate the accuracy of this assumption in 3.1.1 and 3.2.1.

Reference-contexts: We use a test statistic based on the parametric family of distributions with linear failure rate density, which has been shown to be applicable to a large class of nonparametric distributions as well, and has been shown to be applicable to machine behavior <ref> [Doksum84] </ref>. This test does not depend on advance knowledge of the mean of the proposed governing distribution.

Reference-contexts: We wanted a method that would probably yield a set of hosts statistically similar to the overall population of sites on the Internet. We began by compiling a list of all visible host names on the Internet. We used the Census tool <ref> [Ganatra92] </ref>, which queries the top-level DNS servers for the names of the hosts at each site and for secondary domain servers, then recursively applies the process to the entire visible Internet DNS name-tree. This resulted in almost three million hostsnearly ten times the figure we reported four years ago.

Reference-contexts: The data base contained a sequence of tuples, one per available epoch for each host being monitored, of the form &lt;host, boot time, sample time&gt;. The tattler replicas were coordinated using a weak consistency group communication protocol <ref> [Golding92] </ref>. This protocol provides operations for new replicas to join the group, sending the new replica a copy of the data base in the process; for leaving the group, when a tattler is to be shut down; and for propagating metadata and data base changes.

There have been few analyses of host system reliability published, and most of those have been for specific systems. Recent studies include analyses of Tandem systems <ref> [Gray85, Gray90] </ref> and the IBM/XA system [Mourad85]. It is certain that most companies perform reliability studies of their products internally. We have measured the reliability of a wide variety of host systems connected to the Internet.

Reference-contexts: The emphasis on a heterogeneous set of hosts, selected so that its composition should be similar to the overall population of Internet hosts, makes our results more generally applicable than studies specific to one type of system. We conducted a similar study four years ago <ref> [Long91] </ref>, but the method we used to estimate time-to-failure was biased. Estimates of MTTF were derived by querying systems for their up-time. This was the best information available from the host system, since it is not generally in a position to give its failure time as its dying gasp.

Reference-contexts: Since the quantities are being directly measured, questions such as the governing distribution are less important. The current study used a distributed, fault-tolerant measurement system (the Tattler <ref> [Long92] </ref>) to reduce bias from the measurement approach. The tattler system consists of replicated monitoring sites placed at strategic locations around the Internet.

Reference-contexts: of MTTR? In that study we derived MTTR from the MTTF and availability A by: This is most easily derived from two state birth-death process, but by using results from the theory of renewal processes this result can be shown to be independent of the distributions of MTTF and A <ref> [Trivedi82] </ref>. The MTTR estimate is linearly dependent on MTTF. If the MTTF were overestimated, the estimated MTTR would be proportionally longer than the actual. Also, if the confidence interval for the availability of the MTTF is large, then the estimated MTTR can deviate significantly from the true value.
