Abstract: An approach is explicitly formulated to blend a local with a global theory to investigate oscillatory neocortical firings, to determine the source and the information- processing nature of the alpha rhythm. The basis of this optimism is founded on a statistical mechanical theory of neocortical interactions which has had success in numerically detailing properties of short-term-memory (STM) capacity at the mesoscopic scales of columnar interactions, and which is consistent with other theory deriving similar dispersion relations at the macroscopic scales of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) activity. Manuscript received 13 March 1984. This project has been supported entirely by personal contributions to Physical Studies Institute and to the University of California at San Diego Physical Studies Institute agency account through the Institute for Pure and Applied Physical Sciences.
