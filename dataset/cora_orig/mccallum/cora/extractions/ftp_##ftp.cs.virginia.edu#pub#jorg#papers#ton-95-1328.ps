Title: Exact Admission Control for Networks with a Bounded Delay Service  
Author: Jorg Liebeherr (Member), Dallas E. Wrege (Student Member), and Domenico Ferrari (Fellow) 
Abstract: To support the requirements for the transmission of continuous media, such as audio and video, multiservice packet-switching networks must provide service guarantees to connections, including guarantees on throughput, network delays, and network delay variations. For the most demanding applications, the network must offer a service which provides deterministically bounded delay guarantees, referred to as `bounded delay service'. The admission control functions in a network with a bounded delay service require `schedulability conditions' that detect violations of delay guarantees in a network switch. In this paper, exact schedulability conditions are presented for three packet scheduling methods: Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF), Static-Priority (SP), and a novel scheduling method, referred to as Rotating-Priority-Queues (RPQ). By characterizing the worst-case traffic with general subadditive functions, the presented schedulability conditions can be applied to a large class of traffic models. Examples, which include actual MPEG video traces, are presented to demonstrate the trade-offs involved in selecting a packet scheduling method for a bounded delay service.

Reference-contexts: With the exact conditions we can precisely evaluate the efficiency of the scheduling methods. By characterizing the worst-case traffic of a network connection in terms of general subadditive functions, the derived schedulability conditions are applicable to most traffic models used in the literature, e.g., <ref> [3, 6, 8, 23, 13, 18] </ref>. <p> The maximum traffic arrival from connection j 2 N to the packet scheduler is assumed to be bounded by a right-continuous subadditive traffic constraint function A fl j , such that for all times t &gt; 0 and for all t 0 we have <ref> [2, 3] </ref>: A j [t; t + t ] A fl where A fl j (t) = 0 for all t &lt; 0 and A fl We assume that the network has two mechanisms to enforce that traffic on a connection j entering a scheduler conforms to the given traffic constraint <p> For example, the (; )-model <ref> [3] </ref> describes the worst-case traffic on a connection j by a burst parameter j and a rate parameter j , and can be policed by a leaky bucket mechanism [22]. <p> We say that a packet scheduler is stable if all its busy periods are finite. Stability of a packet scheduler implies that the delays in the scheduler queue are finite. The condition for stability of a work conserving packet schedulers is given by <ref> [3] </ref>: lim P N j (t) &lt; 1 (3) To perform admission control tests for a packet sched-uler, one needs to know the conditions that must hold at the scheduler such that delay bound violations do not occur. These conditions are referred to as schedulability conditions. <p> SP is a relatively simple scheduling method since it can be implemented with a fixed number of FIFO queues, one for each priority level.

For the (non-concave) (x min;j ; x ave;j ; I j ; s max j )- model, Zhang and Ferrari [26] and Zhang [25] derived several sufficient schedulability conditions.

By taking into account that packets have a minimum size and relaxing the assumption that the traffic constraint function is derived from the (; )-model, then the schedulabil-ity conditions derived by Cruz in [3] can be expressed as follows: D max p + max max &lt; t j t + t j2C p j (t)+ p1 X X A fl p + max s max 9 ; The difference between (8) and (9) may appear subtle, and in fact, both expression are identical if <p> Thus, for P P connections are SP-schedulable if d p is set to: d p q=1 r&gt;p r p1 X q (11) Since the (; )-model has a concave traffic constraint function, equations (8) and (9) coincide and the above conditions are equivalent to the condition given in <ref> [3] </ref>. 5 Rotating-Priority-Queues Schedulers In this section we present an approximation of the EDF scheduling method, referred to as Rotating-Priority-Queues (RPQ) scheduler. The advantage of RPQ over EDF is that the transmission queue of an RPQ scheduler queue need not be sorted.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A major challenge in the design of multiservice networks with quality-of-service is the implementation of a bounded delay service, that is, a communication service with deterministically bounded delays for all packets from a single connection <ref> [6] </ref>. A rigorous approach to a bounded delay service must consider all delay types that a packet may incur, including fixed processing and propagation delays as well as variable statistical multiplexing delays at network switches. <p> In this paper, we investigate the trade-offs involved in scheduling for three different scheduling methods. We consider two traditional packet scheduling methods, Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) and Static-Priority (SP), both of which have been considered for implementations of bounded delay services <ref> [6, 25] </ref>. The third scheduling method, called Rotating-Priority-Queues (RPQ), is a novel scheduling method for bounded delay services. For each scheduling method we present and prove exact schedulability conditions.

In this paper we restrict ourselves to the best possible, that is necessary and sufficient, schedulability conditions. <p> Ferrari and Verma presented sufficient schedulability conditions for EDF scheduling for a bounded delay service in <ref> [6] </ref>. Using a traffic model with periodic traffic arrivals, Zheng and Shin [30] derived necessary and sufficient schedulability conditions. Georgiadis, Guerin, and Parekh [7] proved necessary and sufficient conditions for a traffic characterization that complies to the (; )-traffic model.

For the (; )-traffic model and with the assumption that the maximum packet transmission time is identical for all connections, the authors of [7] proved that EDF scheduling is optimal with respect to schedulability. Next we present the general necessary and sufficient condition for schedulability in an EDF scheduler. The condition holds for all subadditive traffic constraint functions that bound the traffic on a connection in the sense of equation (1). <p> The term max k;d k &gt;t s max k accounts for the fact that packet transmissions cannot be preempted. In Appendix A we give a complete proof of Theorem 1 which is a generalization of the proofs in [30] and <ref> [7] </ref>. In fact, our proof applies the same arguments as used in the proof of [30]. The steps of the proof carry over readily by replacing the specific traffic constraint function used in [30] by a general subadditive constraint function A fl .

A disadvantage of EDF scheduling is that queued 1 packets must be sorted according to their deadlines, re-quiring a search operation whenever a new packet arrives at the scheduler.

Reference-contexts: For example, the (; )-model [3] describes the worst-case traffic on a connection j by a burst parameter j and a rate parameter j , and can be policed by a leaky bucket mechanism <ref> [22] </ref>. <p> The traffic model in this example is a discrete-time version of the leaky bucket traffic policing mechanism <ref> [22] </ref> which characterizes the worst-case traffic on a connection group j by a parameter set (T j ; b j ; s max j ), where T j denotes the shortest period of packet arrivals, b j denotes the maximum burst size, and s max j denotes the maximum packet size.

Reference-contexts: With the exact conditions we can precisely evaluate the efficiency of the scheduling methods. By characterizing the worst-case traffic of a network connection in terms of general subadditive functions, the derived schedulability conditions are applicable to most traffic models used in the literature, e.g., <ref> [3, 6, 8, 23, 13, 18] </ref>. <p> We refer to [20] for a discussion of the complete parameter sets and statistical analyses of the traces. Previous studies on MPEG transmissions in networks with bounded delay services <ref> [13, 23] </ref> have pointed out that simple traffic models such as the (; )-model are not adequate for expressing the burstiness and temporal correlations of MPEG-encoded video. <p> We denote the traffic that is generated by an MPEG source in time interval [t; t + t ] by A [t; t + t ], and we take the following traffic constraint function E for the MPEG traffic source <ref> [2, 23] </ref>: E (t ) := max A [t; t + t ] It can be easily shown that E , referred to as the empirical envelope, is the best time-invariant and subadditive bound for the given traffic arrival A, in the sense that all traffic constraint functions A fl for <p> [t; t + t ] It can be easily shown that E , referred to as the empirical envelope, is the best time-invariant and subadditive bound for the given traffic arrival A, in the sense that all traffic constraint functions A fl for A satisfy E (t) A fl (t) <ref> [2, 23] </ref>. It is obvious, that the empirical envelope is not a practical traffic constraint function since policing the envelope requires knowledge of all frame sizes in the entire video sequence. <p> We have included a plot that shows the maximum number of supported connections if admission control is based on a peak rate allocation, where the peak rate is determined from the transmission time of the largest I-frame in the sequence <ref> [23] </ref>. For the RPQ scheduler, the rotation intervals are set to = 100; 50; 25 and 20 msec, requiring, respectively, 3; 5; 9; and 11 FIFO queues.

For example, a FIFO scheduler transmits packets in the order of their arrival. We assume that packet transmissions cannot be preempted.

Reference-contexts: However, many packet schedulers will result in an inefficient use of network resources. The performance of a packet scheduling method in providing bounded delay services can be determined by the degree to which it satisfies the following requirements <ref> [18, 25] </ref>: * Efficiency: To efficiently utilize network resources, the packet switches should be able to support bounded delays for a large number of connections. J. Liebeherr and D. E. Wrege are with the Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903. <p> In this paper, we investigate the trade-offs involved in scheduling for three different scheduling methods. We consider two traditional packet scheduling methods, Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) and Static-Priority (SP), both of which have been considered for implementations of bounded delay services <ref> [6, 25] </ref>. The third scheduling method, called Rotating-Priority-Queues (RPQ), is a novel scheduling method for bounded delay services. For each scheduling method we present and prove exact schedulability conditions. With the exact conditions we can precisely evaluate the efficiency of the scheduling methods. <p> In fact, the conditions given in [3] are necessary and sufficient for all concave traffic constraint functions. For the (non-concave) (x min;j ; x ave;j ; I j ; s max j )- model, Zhang and Ferrari [26] and Zhang <ref> [25] </ref> derived several sufficient schedulability conditions. We consider an SP scheduler with P priority levels. Each connection is assigned a priority p with 1 p P , and packets arriving on a connection are inserted into a FIFO queue associated with the priority of the connection.

Reference-contexts: Note that a single packet scheduling method cannot simultaneously optimize all of the above criteria. In particular, high efficiency and low complexity appear to be contradictory design goals. Recently many new scheduling methods were proposed for use in networks with a bounded delay service <ref> [1, 8, 11, 12, 15, 18, 26, 27, 28, 29] </ref>.
