Abstract: The debate continues. In this issue, we include the (recently modified) proposed CADE Bylaws and David Plaisted's comments on this revised set. I encourage AAR members to read the arguments presented and keep ever-present in mind that in most cases, like entropy, sharp change is dangerous. On a different note, G. Huang presents a solution to TopSpin. For those researchers who enjoy puzzles|as I do|Huang's article will be of immediate interest. Finally, for the curious, I cite the results of the recent survey in the AAR Newsletter: the overwhelming majority voted in favor of continuing paper copy of the newsletter (I believe the tally was 3 to 1|total). CADE, Inc., has announced that Alan Robinson will receive the Herbrand Award at CADE-13. The Herbrand Award is given by CADE to honor a person or a group of people for exceptional contributions to the field of automated deduction. It carries a certificate and a check for $1000. Previous awards have been made at CADE-11 to Larry Wos and at CADE-12 to Woody Bledsoe. For those following the continuing saga of the CADE Inc. bylaws, another installment is now available. The CADE Trustees have produced a modified version of David Plaisted's proposed amendments. These new proposals retain the essential elements of David's proposals, namely, democratically elected Trustees, but change some of the details that the Trustees were unhappy about. You can view these proposed changes on the CADE web page on http://www.cs.albany.edu/nvm/
