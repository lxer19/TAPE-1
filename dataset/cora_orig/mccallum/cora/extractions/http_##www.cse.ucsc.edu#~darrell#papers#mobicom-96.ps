Abstract: We address the problem of deciding when to spin down the disk of a mobile computer in order to extend battery life. Since one of the most critical resources in mobile computing environments is battery life, good energy conservation methods can dramatically increase the utility of mobile systems. We use a simple and efficient algorithm based on machine learning techniques that has excellent performance in practice. Our experimental results are based on traces collected from HP C2474s disks. Using this data, the algorithm outperforms several algorithms that are theoretically optimal in under various worst-case assumptions, as well as the best fixed time-out strategy. In particular, the algorithm reduces the power consumption of the disk to about half (depending on the disk's properties) of the energy consumed by a one minute fixed time-out. Since the algorithm adapts to usage patterns, it uses as little as 88% of the energy consumed by the best fixed time-out computed in retrospect.

Reference-contexts: Since the share algorithm outperforms the best fixed time-out, it is exploiting time dependencies in the input values. Of course, it is not surprising that there are time dependencies as it is well-known that user access patterns exhibit bursty behavior <ref> [1] </ref>. from 360 to 370 minutes of Figure 5. 5.3 Predictions of the Share Algorithm a portion of a typical day (Monday, April 20), using a spin-down cost of 10.

Reference-contexts: Although these parameters must be chosen carefully to prove good worst-case bounds on the learning algorithm, the real-world performance of multiplicative weight algorithms appears less sensitive to the choice of parameters (for another example see Blum <ref> [2] </ref> on predicting calendar events). <p> As mentioned in x3, the performance varies by less than one-fifth of one percent as the share rate varies from 0.5 to 1 or the learning rate varies from 3.5 to 4.5. This observation is in agreement with other empirical work on multiplicative weight algorithms <ref> [2] </ref>. The number of experts and distribution of the experts appears to have more impact on the algorithm's performance. Before presenting our main results, we discuss the differences between various fixed time-outs on a typical day's trace data.

Reference-contexts: The share algorithm uses constant time and space, and is simple to implement. In trace-driven simulations, it performs better than all of the algorithms described above, and even conserves more energy than the best fixed time-out. Douglis et al. <ref> [4] </ref> have recently studied some incrementally adaptive disk spin-down policies. The policies they consider maintains a changing time-out value. Whenever the disk access pattern indicates that the current time-out value may be either too long or too short, the current time-out is modified by an additive or multiplicative factor. <p> In particular, although the best fixed time-out is 16.115, the energy used by the 9.34 time-out is within 5% of the energy used by the 16.115 time-out over this 10 minute interval. 5.4 Adaptive Results Douglis et al. <ref> [4] </ref> consider a family of incrementally adaptive spin-down schemes. This family of algorithms has been shown to save significant amounts of energy. These schemes change the time-out after each idle time by either an additive or multiplicative factor. <p> Similarly, we considered three ways of decreasing the time-out: halving it, decreasing it by 1 second, and decreasing it by 0.1 seconds. This gives us nine variations in the incrementally adaptive family. These values were also used in Douglis et al. <ref> [4] </ref> and the long version of Golding et al.[6]. The time-out should never become negative, we constrained the time-out to be at least one decrement amount above zero. We compared each of these nine algorithms with the share algorithm and the daily best time-outs on three different traces.

Reference-contexts: We show that a simple algorithm for deciding when to power down the disk drive is even more effective in reducing the energy consumed by the disk than the best fixed time-out value computed in retrospect. Douglis et al. <ref> [5] </ref> show that the disk sub-system on portable computers consumes a major portion of the available energy (Greenawalt [8] states 30% or more). It is well-known that spinning the disk down when it is not in use can save energy [5, 6, 15, 23]. <p> Douglis et al. [5] show that the disk sub-system on portable computers consumes a major portion of the available energy (Greenawalt [8] states 30% or more). It is well-known that spinning the disk down when it is not in use can save energy <ref> [5, 6, 15, 23] </ref>. Since spinning the disk back up consumes a significant amount of energy, spinning the disk down immediately after each access is likely to use more energy than is saved. <p> A timer is set when the disk becomes idle and if the disk remains idle until the timer expires then the disk is spun down. This time-out can be set by the user, and typical values range from 30 seconds up to 15 minutes. Douglis et al. <ref> [5] </ref>, Golding et al. [6], and other researchers [8, 14, 15] have proposed algorithms which spin the disk down more aggressively, conserving much more power than these relatively long time-outs. <p> So t 0 &gt; 1:176t and the battery life is extended by more than 17%. fixed time-out, such as several minutes <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 It has been shown that energy consumption can be improved dramatically by picking a shorter fixed time-out, such as just a few seconds [5, 6]. <p> So t 0 &gt; 1:176t and the battery life is extended by more than 17%. fixed time-out, such as several minutes [5]. 2 It has been shown that energy consumption can be improved dramatically by picking a shorter fixed time-out, such as just a few seconds <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. For any particular sequence of idle times, the best fixed time-out 3 is the fixed timeout that causes the least amount of energy to be consumed over the sequence of idle times. <p> These two views of the disk spin-down problem are equivalent when the algorithm is allowed to choose a different time-out for each trial. We measure the performance of the algorithms in terms of "seconds of energy" used, a measure introduced by Douglis et al. <ref> [5] </ref>. One "second of energy" is the difference in energy consumed between a spinning disk and a spun down disk over one second. One second of energy corresponds to some number of joules, depending on the model of disk drive used. <p> If we assume that a mobile computer user's disk usage is independent of the type of disk that they have, then this single parameter, the spin-down cost s, is the only statistic about the physical disk that we need for our simulations. Douglis et al. <ref> [5] </ref> compute this value for two disks, giving spin-down costs of 5 seconds and 14.9 seconds. Golding et al. [6] gives disk statistics that correspond to a spin-down cost of 9 or 10 seconds. We analyze the share algorithm's performance for spin-down costs varying from 1 to 20 seconds.

We analyze the share algorithm's performance for spin-down costs varying from 1 to 20 seconds. We define the following metrics, summarized in Table 1, to measure and compare the performance of algorithms.

If the fixed distribution on idle times is known in advance, then one can analyze the distribution in order to choose a good fixed time-out time. Greenawalt <ref> [8] </ref> takes this approach using a Poisson distribution to model the disk drive idle times. He uses this rather strong assumption to solve for the single time-out value giving the best expected performance (over the random choice of idle times).

Reference-contexts: We use a simple algorithm called the share algorithm, a machine learning technique developed by Herb-ster and Warmuth <ref> [10] </ref>, to determine when to spin the disk down. Our implementation of the share algorithm dynamically chooses a time-out value as a function of the (recent) disk activity. Since the algorithm adapts to the recent disk access patterns, it is able to exploit the bursty nature of disk activity. <p> The more misleading the expert the more drastically the expert's weight is slashed. This method causes the predictions of the algorithm to quickly converge to the those of the best expert. Herbster and Warmuth have recently developed the method of a "sharing update" <ref> [10] </ref>. Briefly stated, this update takes some of the weight of each misleading expert and "shares" it among the other experts. Thus an expert whose weight was severely slashed, but is now predicting well, can regain its influence on the algorithm's predictions. <p> Similarly, different values of between 3.5 to 4.5 cause the algorithm's performance to change by at most a factor of 0.0018. We intend to explore methods for self-tuning these parameters in the future. We can now precisely state the algorithm we use: Herbster and Warmuth's <ref> [10] </ref> variable-share algorithm. On each trial the algorithm: 1. Uses a time-out equal to the weighted average of the experts: time-out = P n P n ; 2. Slashes the weights of poorly performing experts w 0 i = w i e Loss (x i ) ; 3. <p> Herbster and Warmuth <ref> [10] </ref> show that if the loss function meets certain properties then this algorithm has very good performance, even in the worst case. Although the loss function we use does not have the properties required for their proof, we show in the next section that its empirical performance is excellent. <p> There is a version of the share update which shares a fixed amount from each expert per trial, instead of an amount proportional to the loss of that expert <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For larger idle periods, this algorithm never consumes more than twice the energy used by the optimal algorithm. An algorithm is called c-competitive or has a competitive ratio of c if it never uses more then c times the energy used by the optimal algorithm <ref> [20, 11] </ref>. So this natural algorithm is 2-competitive, and we will refer to it as the 2-competitive algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Randomized algorithms can be viewed as selecting time-out values from some distribution, and can have smaller (expected) competitive ratios. Although we still compute the competitive ratio based on a worst-case idle time between accesses, we average the energy used over the algorithm's random choice of time-out. Karlin et al. <ref> [12] </ref> give an (expected) ( e e1 )-competitive randomized algorithm.

Reference-contexts: This time-out can be set by the user, and typical values range from 30 seconds up to 15 minutes. Douglis et al. [5], Golding et al. [6], and other researchers <ref> [8, 14, 15] </ref> have proposed algorithms which spin the disk down more aggressively, conserving much more power than these relatively long time-outs. We use a simple algorithm called the share algorithm, a machine learning technique developed by Herb-ster and Warmuth [10], to determine when to spin the disk down. <p> With this assumption, the best fixed time-out on the past idle times should closely approximate the best fixed time-out for the future idle times. Krishnan et al. <ref> [14] </ref> introduce an algorithm designed to operate under this assumption. Their basic algorithm operates in two phases. In the first phase it predicts arbitrarily while building a set of candidate time-outs from the idle times. <p> In practice, it is desirable for algorithms to perform best on the likely input values. One class of algorithms adapts to the input patterns, deducing from the past which values are likely to occur in the future. This approach was taken by Krish-nan et al. <ref> [14] </ref> (see x2). Their algorithm keeps information which allows it to approximate the best fixed time-out for the entire sequence, and thus its performance is about that of the best fixed time-out. We use an algorithm that takes this approach a step further. <p> While the worst case bounds proven for the fixed share version of the algorithm are not as good as the version we use, we have not yet fully explored this variant's empirical behavior. 6.2 Related Problems The power management problem can be viewed as a type of rent-to-buy problem <ref> [14] </ref>. A single rent-to-buy decision can be described as follows: we need a resource for an unknown amount of time, and we have the option to rent it for $1 per unit time, or to buy it once and for all for $c. <p> For how long do we rent the resource before buying it? Many interesting problems can be modeled as a sequence of rent-to-buy decisions. This is called the sequential rent-to-buy problem, or just the rent-to-buy problem <ref> [14] </ref>. For example, the disk spin-down scenario can be modeled as a rent-to-buy problem as follows. A round is the time between any two requests for data on the disk. For each round, we need to solve the disk spin-down problem. <p> Other rent-to-buy problems where the algorithm can be applied include applications such as deciding when a thread that is trying to acquire a lock should busy-wait or context switch or computing virtual circuit holding times in IP-over-ATM networks <ref> [14] </ref>. Our implementation of the share algorithm is efficient, taking taking constant space and constant time per trial. This constant is adjustable, and adjusts the accuracy of the algorithm.
