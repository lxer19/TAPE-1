Abstract: The paper considers the problem of computing a maximal independent set in a hypergraph (see [3] and [7]). We present an efficient deterministic NC algorithm for finding a maximal independent set in a hypergraph of dimension 3: the algorithm runs in time O(log 4 n) time on n + m processors of an EREW PRAM and is optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor. Our algorithm adapts the technique of Goldberg and Spencer ([5]) for finding a maximal independent set in a graph (or hypergraph of dimension 2). It is the first NC algorithm for finding a maximal independent set in a hypergraph of dimension greater than 2.

Reference-contexts: An independent set in H is a subset of V that does not contain any hyperedge of E; an independent set is maximal if it is not properly contained in another independent set. Although several efficient parallel algorithms ([5], [6], <ref> [1] </ref>, [9]) are known for computing a maximal independent set in ordinary graphs (i.e., hypergraphs of dimension 2), the question of whether there is an NC algorithm for arbitrary hypergraphs is still open ([7]).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, algorithm F IN DM IS runs in time O (log 4 n) on n + m EREW processors. At a high level F IN DIS is similar to procedure F IN DSET described in <ref> [5] </ref> (which finds a large independent set in a graph): FINDIS maintains a collection of mutually disjoint independent sets C 1 ; : : :; C r in H 0 . We view each independent set as a color class with the vertices in C i having color i. <p> This is repeated until either a color class C is found with j C [ N 1 (C) j c 0 p log p or a single color class is left. There are two main differences between our procedure F IN DIS and procedure F IN DSET described in <ref> [5] </ref>, namely how the pairs of color classes are selected for merging and how they are actually merged. We first describe how F IN DIS merges color classes. <p> For graphs (or hypergraphs of dimension 2) it suffices to decolor vertices in either C or C 0 that are adjacent to vertices in the other class (see <ref> [5] </ref>). The decoloring for hypergraphs of dimension 3 is based on a simple fact: if a hyperedge of size 3 is contained in C [ C 0 , then it intersects exactly one of C and C 0 in a single vertex. <p> By lemma 1 the number of hyperedges in the complement B (OE; h) of B (OE; h) is at least r (r 1)=2 2c 0 =c 1 r 2 (1=4 2c 0 =c 1 ) r 2 : Procedure F IN DIS invokes the procedure M AT CH of <ref> [5] </ref> to find a matching M in B (OE; h) of size d (1=4 2c 0 =c 1 ) re &lt; (1=4 2c 0 =c 1 ) r + 1: F IN DIS merges all pairs of color classes (C; C 0 ) where (C; C 0 ) is a hyperedge <p> Procedure F IN DIS can be implemented to run in parallel time O (log 2 n) time on n+m EREW processors using standard techniques. These techniques are described in <ref> [5] </ref> and carry over to our problem with only minor modifications. We leave this as a straightforward exercise. 3 Concluding Remarks In this paper we have presented an efficient parallel algorithm for finding a maximal independent set in a hypergraph of dimension 3.
