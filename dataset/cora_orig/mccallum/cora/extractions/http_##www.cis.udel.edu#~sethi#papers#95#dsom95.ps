Abstract: We propose a general mechanism for enhancing the power of the SNMP and SNMPv2 protocols that is backward compatible with both protocols. The mechanism uses a new group of control variables to convey the semantics of protocol operations in PDU exchanges between a manager and an agent. We describe in detail a new enhancement of the protocol using this mechanism that allows implementation of atomic operations without PDU size limitations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) <ref> [1] </ref> was one of several proposals to develop a set of tools powerful enough to manage the increasingly complex computer networks that were created in the late 1980s.

Reference-contexts: There was no change made to the protocol itself. The need to patch up certain deficiencies in the original version of SNMP led to a major overhaul exercise that started in late 1992, resulting in the development of the specifications for SNMP version 2 (SNMPv2) <ref> [2] </ref>. Although SNMPv2 made extensive additions to SNMP in terms of security features, the only new protocol operation added was GETBULK.

Reference-contexts: The presence of a control variable in an SNMP request PDU conveys to an agent the protocol operation that was desired by the manager. Currently, SNMPv2 allows only a certain set of operations, viz., SET, GET, GETNEXT, and GETBULK <ref> [3] </ref>. The agent distinguishes between PDUs containing different kinds of requests by recognizing the different PDU types that are used for different operations.

Reference-contexts: There was extensive debate over the handling of creation and deletion of "conceptual" rows in MIB tables, and SNMPv2 ended by formalizing these operations in the form of textual conventions <ref> [4] </ref>. One of the original philosophies of SNMP was that it should remain a stateless protocol. Thus, an agent would process one request at a time, and have no need to carry over or "remember" information from a previous command PDU.

Reference-contexts: The use of MIB variables to carry meaning rather than data necessitates the creation of another group of variables under the mib-2 subtree of the set of defined objects. In addition to the standard object groups defined by RFC 1213 under MIB-II (e.g., system, interfaces, etc.) <ref> [5] </ref>, we seek to introduce a new group of variables called the Control Group.

Reference-contexts: SNMP was initially created as a temporary short-term solution to manage TCP/IP based networks. But owing to its simplicity, which its original authors had very wisely ensured through the "Fundamental Axiom" <ref> [6] </ref>, SNMP became a protocol in its own right, rather than a stop-gap measure. As with any evolving protocol, SNMP needed revisions and enhancements, the first of which came with the development of the RMON (Remote Monitoring) MIB for SNMP [8]. <p> In the entire process of designing the manager-agent interaction using control variables, the greater part of the burden of memory and computing requirements is put on the manager as far as possible. The agent, keeping in mind the "Fundamental Axiom" <ref> [6] </ref>, is kept as simple minded as possible.

Reference-contexts: As with any evolving protocol, SNMP needed revisions and enhancements, the first of which came with the development of the RMON (Remote Monitoring) MIB for SNMP <ref> [8] </ref>. The RMON Management Information Base (MIB) was a major step in the development of SNMP, but its scope was limited to making SNMP viable in an Internet-based environment. There was no change made to the protocol itself.
