Abstract: In this paper, we describe a concept for the extension of CRMA-II (Cyclic Reservation Multiple Access) by a new service class. CRMA-II is a medium access protocol for slotted gigabit networks. The new service can be used for the ensured transfer of loss- and delay-sensitive traffic, like motion picture transfer or real time communication. The proposed methodology adapts to the known principles of CRMA-II and requires no changes to the way asynchronous services are provided. Finally, we present and discuss some results of our analytical studies for performance evaluation of this conception.

Reference-contexts: Through this characteristics, it is possible to reach better throughput, theoretically eight times more than the capacity of the transmission link <ref> [1] </ref>. Additionally, cell-based transfer mode in CRMA-II supports its compati bility to ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and its suitability as a backbone network. However, a basic feature of high speed networks is the integration of different services for network based multimedia applications.

Reference-contexts: Tabel 1 demonstrates examplary the required and determined parameters for three applications. The information about the characteristics of applications stems from <ref> [2] </ref>. Now, if it is possible to establish a virtual connection with guaranteed quality, the scheduler informs the communication partners about the channel identifier and enters all information relating to the connection in an administrative tabel.

Reference-contexts: It combines a simple busy/free access (so-called gratis access) with a reservation scheme that allows fair access and bound delay in heavy traffic situations. The protocol can be used | in contrary to the earlier version of CRMA <ref> [3] </ref> | either in bus or in single-, dual- or multi-ring networks. But a ring topology is the most effective form in order to get the advantages of the CRMA-II features, like the availability of simultaneous access and slot reuse (spatial reuse).

Reference-contexts: The service station is the medium. This model is also suitable for double-ring-configurations, if you always choose the ring with the shortest distance for transmission. For the analysis of the model, we developed an iterativ procedure based on the method of unfinished work of Tran-Gia <ref> [4] </ref>. With this approximative method we were able to get numerical values inspite of the enormous size of the state space. We focused our analysis on the distribution of the queue length.
