Abstract: Network applications that require high Quality of Service (QoS) are not well supported by today's best-effort Internet. In the future, it will be possible to deploy applications with diverse QoS requirements all in one Integrated Services Network (ISN). One of the key building blocks of ISN is the packet scheduler, and designing packet schedulers that support QoS has become an important research issue. A packet scheduler is a mechanism to time-multiplex network resources among multiple sessions. A popular model for designing packet schedulers is Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS). Various Packet Fair Queueing (PFQ) algorithms are then designed to approximate GPS. GPS and PFQ algorithms can guarantee an end-to-end packet delay bound for a leaky-bucket constrained session, and ensure fair allocation of bandwidth among backlogged sessions regardless of whether their traffic is constrained. In addition, a hierarchy of GPS or PFQ servers can provide hierarchical link-sharing services for sophisticated resource management. Therefore, GPS and PFQ algorithms form a solid foundation for building packet schedulers for ISNs. Unfortunately, the GPS model is not suitable for use in wireless networks. Due to location-dependent channel errors, GPS's fairness property collapses. To address GPS's limitations, we proposed the Channel-condition Independent Fair (CIF) model and the Channel-condition Independent packet Fair Queueing (CIF-Q) algorithm that achieves CIF. CIF and CIF-Q provide real-time guarantees for error-free sessions and graceful degradation for sessions that have received excess service, while ensuring long-term and short-term fairness even in a wireless environment. Moreover, with GPS and CIF, a session's QoS is characterized solely by the guaranteed service rate. In order to achieve a small delay, a session must reserve a large service rate regardless of the session's actual service demand. This can result in under-utilization of network resources and inflexible resource allocation. To address these limitations, we proposed the Fair Service Curve Link-sharing (FSCL) model and the Hierarchical Fair Service Curve (H-FSC) algorithm that approximates FSCL. In FSCL and H-FSC, each session is characterized by a service curve. By choosing the shape of the service curve, real-time delay requirement can be specified independent of the throughput requirement. With these advancements in our understanding of packet schedulers, we will eventually be able to evolve the current Internet into a true Integrated Services Network.

Reference-contexts: This results in unfair behaviors. The root of the above problems is that GPS does not define fairness when some sessions may fall behind due to channel errors. Even though GPS can be augmented to alleviate some of these problems <ref> [8] </ref>, the resulting service paradigm is undesirable.

Reference-contexts: To solve these problems, we propose the Channel-condition Independent Fair (CIF) service model and the Channel-condition Independent packet Fair Queueing (CIF-Q) algorithm <ref> [9] </ref>. The CIF service model is characterized by four basic properties that a PFQ algorithm should have in an error system, they are: * Delay bound and throughput guarantees. Delay bound and throughput are guaranteed for error-free sessions. <p> The expected average case delay is set to be 50 ms 1 . Clearly, the packet delays are well below 50 ms and are independent of other sessions' behaviors. 1 The worst case delay is still bounded but may be considerably larger than 50 ms.

Reference-contexts: Then, water in each small pipe flows at a minimum rate of r i and an instantaneous rate of r fl i (t). This guaranteed minimum service rate ensures (1) an end-to-end packet delay bound can be derived for sessions that are constrained by a leaky-bucket <ref> [10] </ref>, and (2) fair allocation of bandwidth among backlogged sessions regardless of whether their traffic is constrained. In addition, a hierarchy of GPS servers can be integrated to provide hierarchical link-sharing services for sophisticated resource management [1].

Reference-contexts: The latter is important for supporting best-effort service. Although many work-conserving scheduling algorithms are designed, it is difficult to reason about these algorithms and compare their performances. As a result, in <ref> [11] </ref>, the Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) model is proposed to provide a common framework for designing scheduling algorithms. A GPS server with N sessions is characterized by N positive real numbers, 1 ; 2 ; ; N . The server operates at a fixed rate r and is work-conserving. <p> In addition, a hierarchy of GPS servers can be integrated to provide hierarchical link-sharing services for sophisticated resource management [1].

Reference-contexts: Thus, it takes roughly 6.5 ms to transmit a packet. Let both video and FTP sessions be active at time 0. The sessions' packet deadlines are then computed based on their service curves, and the Service Curve Earliest Deadline first (SCED) 6 (a) (b) 7 policy <ref> [12] </ref> is used to select the packet to be transmitted. First, consider the case in Figure 4 (a) where linear service curves are used to specify the sessions' requirements. The arrival curve A i () represents the cumulative number of bits received by session i.

Reference-contexts: Such inflexibility in resource allocation can result in under-utilization of network resources. To address this limitation, based on the service curve QoS model [3, 4], we propose the Fair Service Curve Link-sharing (FSCL) model <ref> [13] </ref>. In FSCL, instead of a weight, each node in the link-sharing hierarchy is characterized by a service curve. <p> We propose the Hierarchical Fair Service Curve (H-FSC) algorithm <ref> [13] </ref> that approximates the FSCL model 2 . <p> Using simulations and experiments, we show that H-FSC approximates FSCL closely and efficiently <ref> [13] </ref> and allows flexible allocation of delay and bandwidth for higher network utilization. 4 Conclusion With many desirable performance characteristics such as delay and throughput guarantees, GPS and PFQ algorithms form a solid foundation for supporting diverse Quality of Service requirements in an Integrated Services Network.

Reference-contexts: Secondly, resource allocation under the GPS model is actually quite inflexible, which can result in under-utilization of network resources. We address these two problems in the following subsections. 3 3.1 Channel-condition Independent Fair Consider a wireless cellular network such as WaveLAN <ref> [14] </ref>. In order to meet the QoS requirements of application sessions on each mobile host, scheduling must be performed at the base-station to allocate the wireless channel bandwidth among the mobile hosts.

Reference-contexts: There are three major building blocks of an ISN, they are (1) resource reservation, (2) admission control, and (3) packet scheduling. First of all, through resource reservation, an application session expresses its QoS requirements to the network. The most well known resource reservation protocol is RSVP <ref> [15] </ref>. Admission control is then applied to decide whether the network has enough resources left to fulfill the application session's QoS requirements.
