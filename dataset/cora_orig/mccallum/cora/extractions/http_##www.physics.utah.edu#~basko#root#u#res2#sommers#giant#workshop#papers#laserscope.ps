Title: LaserScope An atmospheric monitoring system for nitrogen fluorescence cosmic ray detectors.

Abstract: The analysis of cosmic ray data from nitrogen fluorescence detectors requires knowledge of the atmospheric absorption and scattering profile. This is best measured in situ. A new device constructed for probing the atmosphere, based upon readily available commercial equipment and remotely controllable, is discussed below. Preliminary results from tests with the High Resolution Flys Eye Detector are also presented.

Reference-contexts: Previously, these measurements have been made using a number (23) of vertical argon flashers deployed around the Flys Eye detectors <ref> (Bird et al 1995a) </ref>. These flashers project collimated beams of ultra-violet light into the atmosphere at thirty minute intervals. These beams of light are scattered and viewed by the Flys Eye detectors. <p> These beams of light are scattered and viewed by the Flys Eye detectors. However, the position and trajectory of these flashers is fixed, allowing only a partial picture of the atmosphere to be derived. More recently, a LIDAR system <ref> (Bird et al 1995a) </ref> has been developed for use with the High Resolution Eye Detector. This device has a variable trajectory, but is restricted to a single location (Flys Eye 2) due to the physical size of the components and the precise optical alignments required.

Reference-contexts: On different nights, it may remain at the same location or be moved to different locations to investigate the effect of local topography on atmospheric aerosols. 3.2 Sky-Coverage The High Resolution Flys Eye Detector <ref> (Bird et al 1995b) </ref> consists of thousands of pho-tomultiplier tubes (PMTs) viewing the sky through 2m diameter mirrors in clusters of 256 PMTs. Each PMT views a region of the sky 1 degree in diameter.
