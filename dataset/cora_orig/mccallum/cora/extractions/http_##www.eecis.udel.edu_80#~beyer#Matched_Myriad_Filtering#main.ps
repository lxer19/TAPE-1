Abstract: This paper introduces the new class of myriad filters to image processing applications. Like the mean and median filter families, myriad filters emerge as maximum likelihood location estimators. In this case, however, the underlying statis ad filters enjoy efficiency, robustness, edge-preservation, and edge-enhancing properties. Alpha-stable processes include Gaussian processes as a special case and in general satisfy a Generalized Central Limit Theorem that makes them appropriate for modeling physical phenomena. We develop methods to optimize the filter's weights and we show that the attained results consistently outperform linear FIR and weighted median filters in image processing applications.

Reference-contexts: Hybrid methods have proven useful but are nonetheless ad-hoc, and are often too cumbersome. In this paper, we propose the use of the sample myriad in image processing as an alternative to overcome many of the limitations of linear and median filters. The sample Myriad, recently introduced in <ref> [5] </ref>, is the Maximum Likelihood estimator of location for a wide class of impulsive probability distributions including some in the family of ff-stable distributions which have been proven to accurately model impulsive-type processes [6]. <p> Much like the sample mean and sample median are the foundation for linear FIR and weighted median filters, and having the definition of the sample myriad at hand, it is logical to build a corresponding class of estimators namely, weighted myriad filters <ref> [5] </ref>. In this paper, we examine some deterministic properties of weighted myriad filters and their applications to image processing. We show that weighted myriad filters are flexible and offer significant advantages over the well known class of median filters. <p> When k is very large, this implies that all the data is within the in-terquartile range of the Cauchy distribution. Hence, the esti mator considers the data to be "well behaved", in which case a desirable location estimator would be the sample mean. Notably, it can be shown that <ref> [5] </ref> lim ^ fi k = lim myriad fk; x 1 ; ; x N g = meanfx 1 ; ; x N g: (5) As it will pointed our later, the generalization of this property indicates that for k = 1, myriad filters are identical to FIR filters [5]. <p> that <ref> [5] </ref> lim ^ fi k = lim myriad fk; x 1 ; ; x N g = meanfx 1 ; ; x N g: (5) As it will pointed our later, the generalization of this property indicates that for k = 1, myriad filters are identical to FIR filters [5]. Consequently, myriad filters can replace linear filters, since myriad filters produce identical outputs for large k, while still having the flexibility to be more robust due to the parameter k. <p> We note here that k does not need to be "large" in the absolute numerical sense for the myriad filter to act as a linear filter. In general, the sample myriad behaves as the sample mean for k in the order of the sample range <ref> [5] </ref>. Response when k ! 0: The sample myriad also exhibits interesting characteristics as k tends to zero. In this case, most of the data is modeled as lying outside the interquartile range of the Cauchy distribution and the estimator considers almost all of the data to be unreliable.

Reference-contexts: class of ff-stable distributions spans a wide range of distributions, from well behaved to highly impulsive, and since the sample myriad is the optimal location estimator in all these cases, it turns out that the myriad is a natural location estimator for processes that can be characterized by ff-stable models <ref> [7] </ref>. It should be noted that ff-stable variables are important in practice since these obey two important properties: stability and the Generalized Central Limit Theorem [6].

The interested reader is directed to <ref> [8] </ref> for more information on this topic. Here we develop a simple and tunable approach to determine desirable characteristics of the filtering operation. We let all samples in the window, except the center sample, contribute equally to the filter output.
