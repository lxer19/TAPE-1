Title: Dispersion Analysis of Numerical Wave Propagation and its Computational Consequences  
Author: Alain Sei and William Symes 
Note: (Submitted to the Journal of Scientific Computing)  
Abstract: We present in this paper a comparison of the dispersion properties for several finite-difference approximations of the acoustic wave equation. We investigate the compact and staggered schemes of fourth order accuracy in space and of second order or fourth order accuracy in time. We derive the computational cost of the simulation implied by a precision criterion on the numerical simulation (maximum allowed error in phase or group velocity). We conclude that for moderate accuracy the staggered scheme of second order in time is more efficient, whereas for very precise simulation the compact scheme of fourth order in time is a better choice. The comparison increasingly favors the lower order staggered scheme as the dimension increases. In three dimensional simulation, the cost of extremely precise simulation with any of the schemes is very large, whereas for simulation of moderate precision the staggered scheme is the least expensive.

Reference-contexts: this essential drawback, the current practice consists of plotting the dispersion curves of the given numerical method and deriving from those curves a "rule of thumb" for the number of points per wavelength and the number of points per period one needs to take to have a small error (cf <ref> [1] </ref>). A natural idea is to use very accurate methods so that dispersion errors will intrinsicly be very small.

This limitation on the order of the spatial derivatives is a consequence of our previous work (cf <ref> [8] </ref>). We showed that for staggered schemes, higher order were not better. 2 Precision Criteria and Computational Cost To compare the different numerical schemes, we demand that they all fulfill the same precision requirements. We consider phase and group velocity errors. <p> We concentrate on the two most widely used (2-4) schemes, the (2-4) compact scheme (cf [13]) and the (2-4) staggered scheme (cf <ref> [8] </ref>). Those schemes are used to integrate the acoustic wave equation which is a model for the propagation of small disturbances in an acoustic medium. This kind of medium is caracterized by its density and its bulk modulus K, which are functions of the space coordinates x and y.

Reference-contexts: We will also use a model of one hundred wavelength (J = 100), which is a typical size in geophysical applications. 2.2 Group Velocity Criterion It is well known that the group velocity governs the propagation of wave packets, that is the propagation of "energy" (cf <ref> [15] </ref> and [16]). It is therefore important to control the numerical effects on the group velocity. To do so we impose, like for the phase velocity, that the group shift between the exact and numerical wave be less than a portion of the shortest wavelength.
