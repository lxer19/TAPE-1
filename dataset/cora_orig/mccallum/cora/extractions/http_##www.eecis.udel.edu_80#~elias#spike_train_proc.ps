Title: SPIKE TRAIN PROCESSING BY A SILICON NEUROMORPH: THE ROLE OF SUBLINEAR SUMMATION IN DENDRITES

Abstract: A dendritic tree, as part of a silicon neuromorph, was modelled in VLSI as a multibranched, passive cable structure with multiple synaptic sites that either depolarize or hyperpolarize local "membran patches", thereby raising or lowering the probability of spike generation of an integrate-and-fire "soma". As expected from previous theoretical analyses, contemporaneous synaptic activation at widely separated sites on the artificial tree resulted in near-linear summation, as did neighboring excitatory and inhibitory activations. Activation of synapses of the same type close in time and space produced local saturation of potential, resulting in spike train processing capabilities not possible with linear summation alone. The resulting sublinear synaptic summation, as well as being physiologically plausible, is sufficient for a variety of spike train processing functions. With the appropriate arrangement of synaptic inputs on its dendritic tree, a neuromorph was shown to discriminate input pulse intervals and patterns, pulse train frequencies, and detect correlation between input trains.

Reference-contexts: While a number of VLSI implementations of neurons and neuronal processing systems To appear in Neural Computation 2 have been built <ref> (see Douglas et al. 1995 for review) </ref>, most have focused on processing specific forms of sensory information, usually visual or auditory. Our approach is to develop "general purpose" neuromorphs that can be readily used in large-scale networks.

Reference-contexts: We also explore some synaptic arrangements that detect synchrony more efficiently than simple temporal summation. 2 Experimental Hardware System Our silicon neuron, or neuromorph, comprises an artificial dendritic tree (ADT) <ref> (Elias, 1993) </ref>, and a leaky integrate-and-fire "soma" (Fig. 1b). The dendritic branches are composed of a series of identical compartments each with a capacitor, C m , representing a membrane capacitance, and two programmable resistors, R a and R m , representing the axial cytoplasmic and membrane resistances. <p> For most experiments, the spike generator had a relatively short RC time constant of 0.75 msec in order to produce reasonably high spike firing rates. The neuromorph under study was embedded in the "virtual wire system" previously described <ref> (Elias, 1993) </ref>. This system allows spikes generated by neuromorphs to be distributed with programmable delays to arbitrary synapses throughout a network. A host computer set the spike firing threshold, V th , (Fig. 1b), and generated the spatiotemporal patterns of spikes used as test stimuli for the neuromorph.

Reference-contexts: The shape and duration of the synaptic impulse response depends upon dendrite dynamics, which by means of the adjustable resistors R a and R m , is programmable over a range of six orders of magnitude <ref> (Elias and Northmore, 1995) </ref>. <p> Sublinear effects may also be prolonged by reducing the spread of charge along the dendrite by increasing the axial resistance, R a . Thus, all spike-interval and frequency-selective effects due to sublinear summation can be readily tuned in our neuromorphs by varying the dendritic dynamics <ref> (Elias & Northmore, 1995) </ref>. Diffusion of charge from a compartment can also be inuenced by contemporaneous synaptic activations in neighboring compartments, so that the spatiotemporal arrangement of synaptic activations on dendrites can lead to a number of interesting and useful effects. <p> Opportunities for tuning the peaks include changing dendrite dynamics (via R m and R a ) <ref> (Elias and Northmore, 1995) </ref> and adjusting synaptic connectivity. An alternate mechanism for generating spike-frequency selectivity, refractoriness following spike firing, can also limit a neuron's responsiveness to high input frequencies if synaptic activations are wasted during the refractory period.

Reference-contexts: Frequency-selective neural circuits play an important part in neural information processing, particularly in sensory systems where the temporal structure of environmental signals must be analyzed. For example, neurons in the auditory system of frogs fire preferentially to the frequency of amplitude modulation present in the mating calls of conspecifics <ref> (Rose, 1986) </ref>. The mechanism whereby these cells respond to specific spike train frequencies could involve the dynamics of certain membrane conductances (Zucker, 1989; McCormick, 1990; Midtgaard, 1994), although the present work suggests that the appropriate pattern of excitatory and inhibitory synapses on passive dendrites is sufficient.

Reference-contexts: Because of recent interest in synchronous spiking activity in cortical neurons and the possibility that it may provide a solution to the binding problem <ref> (Singer and Gray, 1995) </ref>, we also examined the response of our neuromorph to varying degrees of input synchrony.

Reference-contexts: Similar considerations are likely to apply to real neurons in that refractoriness of the soma will be much less discriminatory against activations occurring distally on dendrites rather than proximally. If, however, somatic spikes propagate into the dendrite tree and activate conductances that shunt synaptic potentials there <ref> (Stuart and Sakman, 1994) </ref>, some wastage of highly synchronous synaptic inputs will occur. Sublinear synaptic 11 summation, on the other hand, operates locally, and therefore with greater specificity as to input source.
