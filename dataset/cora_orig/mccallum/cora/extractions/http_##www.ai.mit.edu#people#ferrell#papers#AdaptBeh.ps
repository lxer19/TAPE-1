Abstract: fl Support for this research was provided in part by a NASA Graduate Student Researcher Program Fellowship administered through the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, by Jet Propulsion Laboratory grant 959333, and by the Advanced Research Projects Agency under Office of Naval Research contract N00014-91-J-4038.

Reference-contexts: Building autonomous mobile robots capable of performing tasks in environments that are either too dangerous or unsuitable for humans has been a long term goal of the field. For example, research is underway to develop autonomous systems capable of exploring planets <ref> (Angle & Brooks 1990) </ref>, (Bares & Whittaker 1990) or oceans (Payton, Keirsey, Kimple, Krozel & Rosenblatt 1992), (Stuart 1988). These tasks require that the robot perform its task for long periods of time without the luxury of repair when components fail. <p> It was designed and built under the supervision of Prof. Rodney Brooks in the Artificial Intelligence lab at MIT <ref> (Angle & Brooks 1990) </ref>. The robot is perhaps the most sophisticated and complex robot for its size. It measures 35 cm long, stands 15 cm high and weighs 2.8 kg. It has six 3 degree of freedom (DOF) legs.

Reference-contexts: It has six 3 degree of freedom (DOF) legs. Despite its small size, Hannibal currently has 19 actuators and over 60 sensors of 5 different types all connected via a local network to 8 on-board computers. The robot's 3 THE ISSUES 4 control organization is behavior-based <ref> (Brooks 1986) </ref>. It is programmed in the Behavior Language, a front end for the Subsumption Architecture (Brooks 1990).

The following types of sensors are mounted on Hannibal: * Leg mounted force sensors: these are foil strain gauges that can be used to measure loads on the leg and to detect leg collisions.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, the adaptive approach implements one walking behavior which can alter its gait by changing a parameter. Low level control is responsible for detecting catastrophic failures and alerting high level control. High level control is responsible for adapting the robot's behavior so that locomotion remains stable (see <ref> (Ferrell 1993) </ref> for details). 7 Fault Tolerance Network The following sections describe the distributed network that implements fault tolerance on Hannibal. As with the rest of Hannibal's control system, fault tolerance is implemented with concurrently running processes. Fault tolerance consists of four phases: error detection, masking, recovery, and reintegration. <p> Other processes run concurrently 7 FAULT TOLERANCE NETWORK 12 on the same leg to tolerate a variety global failures as well. The processes mentioned above are replicated for each leg and run simutaneously. We refer the interested reader to <ref> (Ferrell 1993) </ref> which presents our fault tolerance implementation in more detail as well as the overall control of our legged robot. 7.1 Detection The detection processes are responsible for recognizing sensor and acutator failures. <p> If a leg-pain energy level rises above the lesion threshold, the corresponding leg-injury agent activates the lesion behavior. The lesion behavior disables the leg and adopts a gait that is stable without the use of the damaged leg (figure 14). The lesion behavior is described in <ref> (Ferrell 1993) </ref>. 8 PERFORMANCE 22 7.5.4 Reintegration If the broken leg is repaired or the leg was wrongly determined to be broken, high level agents reintegrate the leg. This is accomplished by occasionally testing the leg to see if it is functional again.

Reference-contexts: Replication of hardware is commonly used to enhance hardware reliability. Several commercial systems, such as Gray (1990), Siewiorek & Johnson (1981), use this approach to achieve robustness. Replication of processors has been used to achieve fault tolerance in a few robotics applications ((Lin & Lee 1991) and <ref> (Kabuka, Harjadi & Younis 1990) </ref>). In Hannibal's case, this approach would correspond to replicating sensors and actuators. For a sensing example, multiple potentiometers could be used to sense a particular joint angle.
