Abstract: We describe the design of a parallel global atmospheric chemical tracer model. This is part of a larger Earth Systems Model (ESM) for atmospheric dynamics and physics, and ocean physics. The ESM will be used for global warming and ozone depletion studies, among others. Our goal is to parallelize the chemistry model to run efficiently on current and future parallel architectures, including the Sequoia archival database. We describe our preliminary design, especially the detailed timing model, and some initial validations. We have found a timing modeling very valuable for designing for a large range of architectures.

Reference-contexts: To accomplish this, it must include coupled models of the atmosphere and oceans. The starting point will be the UCLA general circulation model of the atmosphere (AGCM) <ref> [1] </ref>, the GFDL/Princeton University general circulation model of the ocean (OGCM) [2], and the AMES/UCLA chemical tracer model (GATOR) [7]. These models are being paral-lelized, coupled, and linked to the Sequoia database system [9]. GATOR, which stands for Gas, Aerosol, Transport and Radiation model, was developed by R. Turco, O.

Reference-contexts: For example, on the DEC Alpha gigaswitch network, we assume that the overhead and latencies arise from using a software message passing system such as PVM for communication <ref> [4] </ref>. The Mflop rate for the `Alpha 1' group was measured using GATOR, although with adjustments to the code to improve cache performance, we expect to realize higher Mflop rates.

Reference-contexts: Because of the variation in the amount of computation from cell to cell, we also investigated various static mapping strategies of vertical columns to processors. In particular we considered block, cyclic, and block-cyclic static mapping strategies, as in HP Fortran <ref> [6] </ref>. 4 Algorithms and Timing Models The performance models for the parallel system include the time necessary for the ODE solver, all the routines that involve horizontal transport, and I/O.

Reference-contexts: This significantly diminishes the I/O cost. Finally, in the last table entry the overhead and latency costs of the network have been reduced to around 100 microseconds, using a low latency communication medium such as active messages <ref> [10] </ref> on the CM-5 parallel machine. This configuration makes the workstation cluster competitive with the MPP and vector machines shown in Table 4. 5.4 Summary We have introduced performance models that have been useful in identifying the important aspects of the design of a parallel implementation of GATOR.
