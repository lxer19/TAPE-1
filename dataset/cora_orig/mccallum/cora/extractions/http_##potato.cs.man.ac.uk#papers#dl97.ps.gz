Reference-contexts: Compositions which are only sanctioned at the grammatical level cannot be instantiated. Sanctions are inherited down the subsumption hierarchy, and a grammatical sanction must be in place before a sensible sanction can be asserted. Grail is implemented as a Terminology Server <ref> [BGA + 97] </ref>, providing access to a range of terminological services and operations.

Reference-contexts: Such an approach has been used with traditional databases [EFP94]. The IMACS project <ref> [BST + 93] </ref> used a CLASSIC knowledge base to support data mining and knowledge discovery, providing more sophisticated feedback.

Reference-contexts: The definition of a clear semantics for sanctioning is currently being investigated - [Sch96] describes a model theoretic semantics for sanctions. The feedback provided sits well with the four maxims of Grice <ref> [Gri78] </ref>. The maxim of Relevance states that the interface should provide relevant contributions, while that of Quantity states that contributions should be as informative as is required for the current purposes of the exchange and should not be more informative than is re quired.

Reference-contexts: This work began with PEN & PAD, has evolved from experiments with user interface requirements and now forms part of the latest version of a major computer package for General Practioners <ref> [Kir95] </ref>. However, such work has focused primarily on data entry rather than query formulation. The data forms are driven by the sensible sanctions in the model, ensuring that the options available for input correspond to compositions that exist.

Reference-contexts: These description logic queries are then rewritten to database queries directed to various information sources. The second uses a small demonstration database of people and documents, and provides additional feedback about query results. 2 The GRAIL Description Logic Grail <ref> [RBG + 97] </ref> is a Description Logic developed by the Medical Informatics Group at Manchester University. It has a restricted set of concept formation operators and the addition of a mechanism for constraining the construction of composite concepts, known as sanctioning.

Reference-contexts: By defining a broad and narrow domain and range for each role, we can provide more control and different constraints for different applications. The definition of a clear semantics for sanctioning is currently being investigated - <ref> [Sch96] </ref> describes a model theoretic semantics for sanctions. The feedback provided sits well with the four maxims of Grice [Gri78].

Reference-contexts: This use of sanctions allows the constrained formulation of queries through a dialogue, with the interface providing feedback relating to both the schema and contents of the database. We have two current prototypes. The first, developed as part of the TAMBIS project <ref> [Tam] </ref>, allows molecular biologists to construct queries over concepts in biology. These description logic queries are then rewritten to database queries directed to various information sources.

Reference-contexts: By restricting, for example, replacement options, the interface does not deluge the user with spurious options when offering alternatives. Another common technique used for database query is that of Query-by-Example [Zlo75], or retrieval by instan-tiation <ref> [TWF + 82] </ref>, where a particular instance is presented as a representative of a class of instances which the user is interested in. In a traditional form-based approach, the properties of the example would be used to fill in the particular values of the form.
