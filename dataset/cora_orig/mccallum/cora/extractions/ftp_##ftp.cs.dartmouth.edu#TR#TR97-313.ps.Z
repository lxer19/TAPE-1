Abstract: This thesis presents a self-organized file cabinet. This file cabinet uses electronic information to augment the physical world. By using a scanner to transform documents into electronic files, the self-organized file cabinet can index the documents on visual and textual information. The self-organized file cabinet helps the user find the documents at a later date. The focus of this thesis is on the design and evaluation of the self-organized file cabinet. User studies show that this tool is natural to use.

Reference-contexts: Dawn Lawrie May 29, 1997 2.2 InteractiveDesk The designers of the desk believe that the desk is the center for intellectual human activities and that the object will retain its importance even with the increasing capabilities of computers <ref> [AM+94] </ref>. For this reason, they have developed a desk which allows the user to interactive with the computer as if it were a more traditional desk. The components of the desk include a computer with keyboard and mouse.

Reference-contexts: Dynamic databases are more challenging because the system has to be able to deal with adding and removing information from the database without recomputing the entire organization. Such a method that works on dynamic databases has been developed called the Online Star Algorithm <ref> [APR] </ref>. The Online Star Algorithm uses an enhanced version of the Smart Information Retrieval System [Sal91] to compute a document to document similarity graph. The vertices of the graph correspond to documents and the weighted edges show the similarity between the corresponding documents. <p> This helps prevent relevant documents from being overlooked or running into deadends without finding anything of interest. 2.5 The Online Star Algorithm The Online Star Algorithm provides a more accurate way to cluster documents <ref> [APR] </ref>. It clusters either all the documents within the current database or a subset of the documents. The Online Star Algorithm uses an augmented Smart Information Retrieval System [Sal91] to index the documents. <p> This is a postprocessor algorithm that gives a "hierarchical organization of a collection into clusters. Each level in the hierarchy is determined by a threshold for a minimum similarity between the pairs of documents within a cluster at that particular level in the hierarchy" <ref> [APR] </ref>. The star algorithm produces dense clusters that approximate cliques with probable guarantees on the pairwise similarity between cluster documents. Through user studies it has been determined that this algorithm has a good performance.

Reference-contexts: In one proof he referred to God as the ultimate organizer or designer. Since everything had to be organized, there must be an organizer. In turn this organizer had to be organized, and so on, until one ran into the original organizer and this was God <ref> [HJT97a] </ref>. The idea of self-organization was born out of a study of life in greater depth. Life itself appeared to be self-organized. The chemicals needed to produce proteins had to organize themselves so that life could begin. There are other places where self-organization can be observed occurring rather naturally.

Reference-contexts: They defined it as "a system which changes its basic structure as a function of its experience and environment" <ref> [HJT97b] </ref>. This definition has been slightly modified because an organism does not organize itself independent of its environment. Von Foerster persuasively argued that only organisms and their environments taken together organize themselves. <p> Von Foerster persuasively argued that only organisms and their environments taken together organize themselves. Ashby redefined a self-organizing system to be not an organism that changes its structure as a function of its experience and environment but rather the system consisting of the organism and environment taken together <ref> [HJT97b] </ref>. Dawn Lawrie May 29, 1997 Self-organization has been studied in many fields including biology (insect societies, human brains), chemistry (thermodynamics), computer science (decision algorithms, robotics systems), geology (tectonic movements), sociology (communication and migration) and economy (socio-spatial systems). This thesis describes our experiences with self-organized information systems.

Reference-contexts: Similar documents are connected by hyperlinks which allow for the comparison between blocks of texts of similar types of information. Hyperlinks are actually edges of a weighted graph determined by the Hausdroff shape comparison metric <ref> [HR93] </ref>. There are three components used within Smart. First the segmenter automatically divides the paper into units. Then the classifier automatically labels the units produced by the segmenter with document types.

Reference-contexts: The system answers these queries with the objects location telling what part of the desk it is on and if it is hidden from view, what is hiding it. 2.4 Scatter/Gather Browsing Scatter/Gather provides a fast way to browse a large set of information <ref> [PS+96] </ref>. It has been designed to use with web searches. The general principal is that people would prefer to get an idea of what type of information is available before investing a lot of time reading specific documents.

Reference-contexts: Smart uses a vector space model for document retrieval. The vector space is defined by the important words occurring in the corpus. This version of Smart has been augmented to incorporate the layout of a paper to give more information about topics and subtopics discussed in the paper <ref> [RA96] </ref>. Similar documents are connected by hyperlinks which allow for the comparison between blocks of texts of similar types of information. Hyperlinks are actually edges of a weighted graph determined by the Hausdroff shape comparison metric [HR93]. There are three components used within Smart.

Reference-contexts: These cameras could track the movement of everything within the office. One might be placed to monitor the bookshelf, and another watching the desk. A computer would then analyze the input from the camera and track locations of objects. The implementation of a self-organized desk has already been attempted <ref> [RD97] </ref>. It turns out that three-dimensional objects are extremely hard to identify. The self-organized desk has restricted its objects to papers because they are easier to identify. However, it is also difficult to identify the exact location of a paper. <p> The desk uses a camera to recognize these objects. The camera is also used to anticipate which work space the user to using. This determines which monitor is used to display the items. 2.3 The Self-Organizing Desk The self-organizing desk <ref> [RD97] </ref> shares many features with the self-organizing file cabinet since the desk was the predecessor to the file cabinet. The desk uses a camera to monitor the traffic on a desktop.

Reference-contexts: Such a method that works on dynamic databases has been developed called the Online Star Algorithm [APR]. The Online Star Algorithm uses an enhanced version of the Smart Information Retrieval System <ref> [Sal91] </ref> to compute a document to document similarity graph. The vertices of the graph correspond to documents and the weighted edges show the similarity between the corresponding documents. The similarity graph uses a threshold so that the resulting graph can be covered by dense star-shaped subgraphs. <p> It clusters either all the documents within the current database or a subset of the documents. The Online Star Algorithm uses an augmented Smart Information Retrieval System <ref> [Sal91] </ref> to index the documents. When clustering the documents, it creates a similarity graph where the documents are vertices and the weighted edges correspond to similarity. The algorithm uses a threshold to cover the graph with star-shaped subgraphs and create the clusters. Users can then examine each cluster individually. <p> The parent structure is the filing cabinet itself. A filing cabinet consists of drawers. The implementation structure of the drawers is a dynamically allocated array. The textual and visual index modules are also included. The textual index is an augmented Smart object developed from the Smart Information Retrieval System <ref> [Sal91] </ref>. Smart examines the statistics of word occurrence in a document relative to a document collection. It uses the statistics to create vector space model for the document collection that supports queries using an algorithm for computing Dawn Lawrie May 29, 1997 vector proximity in the vector space. <p> Dawn Lawrie May 29, 1997 3.2 The Search Algorithms There are three different types of searching methods available. The file cabinet can be queried on keywords, with color and placement of color, and documents related by text. The keyword queries use an augmented version of the Smart System <ref> [Sal91] </ref>, which is a sophisticated text-retrieval system. Smart uses a vector space model for document retrieval. The vector space is defined by the important words occurring in the corpus.

Reference-contexts: The Intelligent Room offers many features which include: the computer's ability to track the room's occupants and understand human gestures; intelligent agents that "autonomously navigate National Information Infrastructure to retrieve information or to provide computational service to the room" <ref> [Tor95] </ref>; and agents that keep a repository of data and plans in a persistent database. The room uses cameras to tract the occupants of the room. The computer selects two of the most interesting views of the image to track the proceedings in the room.
