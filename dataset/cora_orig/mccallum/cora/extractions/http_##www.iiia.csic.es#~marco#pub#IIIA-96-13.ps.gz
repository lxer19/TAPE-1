Abstract: Our research focuses on the design of easily accessible languages to formalize at very high level the preliminary specification of systems. A methodology to approach this problem is the use of visual languages with the idea of making logics more approachable by users. In this paper we present a first step towards this direction: the design of a visual logic programming language. This language is based on presenting logical predicates via diagrammatic set abstractions, and using graphical set inclusion as the main mechanism to construct formulas (= diagrams). We also show our intuitions for an operational semantics based on chaining within the context of resolution-based theorem proving, and explore some of the advantages of using our visual notation during the query solving process.

Reference-contexts: In the future we plan to implement an interpreter of our visual language based on the ideas presented in this paper. Finally, we would like to come back to our original idea of a visual language for the rapid prototyping of preliminary specifications and their 10 stepwise refinement <ref> [ARP95] </ref>. We think that many of the informal diagrams used in the software lifecycle could be naturally expressed using our visual syntax, and thus integrated directly into the design process.
