Abstract: This paper addresses two modi of analogical reasoning. The first modus is based on the explicit representation of the justification for the analogical inference. The second modus is based on the representation of typical instances by concept structures. The two kinds of analogical inferences rely on different forms of relevance knowledge that cause non-monotonicity. While the uncertainty and non-monotonicity of analogical inferences is not questioned, a semantic characterization of analogical reasoning has not been given yet. We introduce a minimal model semantics for analogical inference with typical instances.

Reference-contexts: A concept structure is displayed as a directed acyclic graph as in figure 1. In this city example, the instances are not directly represented as maps, but we deal with another concept representation which is similar to that employed by Barwise and Etchemendy <ref> [3] </ref>. It encodes instances as tables. Nevertheless, the conceptual part of the knowledge base is non-propositional because of the concept structure. The Reasoner In order to integrate the conceptual subsystem into the framework, its informational content has to be accessible.

Reference-contexts: In (semantic net and frame) representations that use prototypes, such as the TypicalElephant of <ref> [4] </ref>, certain analogical inferences provide new information by copying facts from the prototype to the individual. Even though known as "inheritance", actually this reasoning is another common kind of analogical reasoning, which we shall call typical-example-based. As the Tweety story shows, it is non-monotonic as well.

Reference-contexts: The relevance knowledge "A 1 is relevant for A 2 ", written as [A 1 ; A 2 ], is usually represented explicitly and propositionally, as determinations [7], as schemata [11], as connections [19], or as similarity transforms <ref> [6] </ref>. In modeling human analogical reasoning, the relevance knowledge must allow for exceptions and uncertainty rather than being a logical implication or a total determination. In the following we use the most general notion, connection, that does not require a specific representation and may have exceptions.

This kind of analogical inference requires for its justification some relevance knowledge expressing that A 1 is relevant for A 2 .

In order to describe non-monotonicity semantically, Shoham [25] has introduced an order on the interpretations and weakened the notions of satisfiability, of consequence etc.
