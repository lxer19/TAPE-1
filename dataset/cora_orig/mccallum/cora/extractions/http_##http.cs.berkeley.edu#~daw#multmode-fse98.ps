Title: Cryptanalysis of some recently-proposed multiple modes of operation  
Author: David Wagner 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: University of California,  
Abstract: In a paper cryptanalyzing many triple modes of operation, Biham proposed four new triple modes and five new quadruple modes of operation for DES. It was conjectured that the complexity (in a particular threat model) of breaking the triple modes is at least 2 112 and that the quadruple modes are more secure than any triple mode. We present new attacks on all but one of the proposed modes. We can break all but two of Biham's proposed modes with at most 2 56 off-line trial encryptions and between 2 and 2 32 (depending upon the mode) chosen-IV chosen texts; another mode can be broken with somewhat more work. This raises questions about the suitability of the proposed modes, and provides further evidence for the fragility of inner chaining; however, we emphasize that our results do not disprove Biham's conjectures, as we rely on an extended attack model which admits more powerful adversaries who can mount chosen-IV queries, a capability de nied to them in Biham's model.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, there is great interest in the search for a multiple mode of operation for DES which provides increased strength against exhaustive keysearch while retaining the high level of analysis and confidence that single-DES currently offers. Biham <ref> [Bih96] </ref> analyzed a great many triple modes of operation, and broke every mode considered except the commonly-used triple-DES-ECB mode (when used with some outer chaining technique). <p> We now describe how to finish the attack on CBCj CBCjCBC 1 jCBC 1 . All that remains is to analyze the triple mode CBCj CBC 1 jCBC 1 . Biham has showed how to break this triple mode with 2 68 chosen plaintexts and 2 66 work <ref> [Bih96] </ref>. Nonetheless, in our security model, 2 68 texts are quite a high barrier, and one might wonder whether there are more efficient attacks. The answer is yes.

Reference-contexts: All of our attacks recover the secret DES keys. The basic ideas behind the attacks are not entirely novel; many of them are applications of the general tools worked out by Coppersmith, Johnson, and Matyas <ref> [CJM97] </ref> and Biham [Bih94a,Bih94b,Bih96]. The nine new block modes which Biham proposed are 1. OFB [CBC,CBC 1 ], 3. OFB [CBC,CBC], Cryptanalysis of some recently-proposed multiple modes of operation 257 5. CBCjCBCjCBC 1 jCBC 1 , 6. CFBjCFBjCFB 1 jCFB 1 , 7. OFB [CBC,CBC,CBC 1 ], 9. OFB [CFB,CFB,CFB]. <p> However, adding this much complexity to the system may begin to test the limits of one's comfort zone; at the least, more analysis seems needed. Add redundancy to IVs. Coppersmith et al. <ref> [CJM97] </ref> have applied a novel countermeasure to stop a chosen-IV attack we discovered on their original CBCM proposal. They limit the possible values for each IV to a small subset: one IV is fixed at 0, and the other 64-bit IV has 44 of its bits fixed at 0.

Reference-contexts: E K2 (IV 2 [i]) E K2 (IV 2 [j]); which lets us recover K1; K2 with complexity 2 56 by a standard meet-in-the-middle attack. (The straightforward implementation of that attack also requires 2 56 space, though the space requirements can be dramatically reduced by using parallel collision search algorithms <ref> [OW96] </ref>.) Applying these techniques, we can convert our chosen-IV attacks to attacks which need 2 32 known-IV chosen texts and O (2 56 ) work, for all the triple modes in Section 4, as well as for OFB [CBC,CBC].
