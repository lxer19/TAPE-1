Abstract: Sequoia 2000 is a research initiative funded by the Digital Equipment Corporation to develop large capacity object servers to support global change research. Existing hardware, software, network technology, and visualization techniques are inadequate to the task of handling the terabytes of data which global change researchers need to access and manipulate. The purpose of Sequoia 2000 is to develop the needed technology and to create an electronic repository in which researchers' data sets, programs, documents, and simulation outputs can be stored and made available to multiple users. Sequoia 2000 is a multidisciplinary, multi-campus, multi-agency project; researchers are from the fields of computer science, information science, and global change, and are located in private industry, universities, and state and federal agencies. This is a report of the initial stage of phase one of a study exploring collaboration and technology transfer resulting from this large research initiative. This phase will examine motivations for collaboration at different stages of the project and by players with different relationships to it. Investigators' initial motivations for participation, collaborative behavior attributable to the project, and the extension of Sequoia technology to colleagues of the initial vinvestigators will be examined. This first report focuses on the inter-relationships among the goals of the various initial participants and the activity which brought the project into existence, and describes plans for the remainder of the project.
