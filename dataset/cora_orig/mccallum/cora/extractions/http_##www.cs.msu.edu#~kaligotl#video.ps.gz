Abstract: Desktop computers are increasingly being used as communication deivces. Advances in digital media are making the integration of video into desktop computers practical, both technically and economically. At the convergence of these technologies is computer- integrated video conferencing. This project is aimed at building a prototype video only conferencing system called Videocon, to gain hands-on experience with implementing a multimedia application. Videocon is implemented using TCP/IP as the transport protocol and was mainly tested on Ethernet. It was found that Ethernet is incapable of supporting more than four users in conference. Efficient transport protocols need to be designed, which can deliver the high bandwidth of the underlying network to the applications. High bandwidth networks with low overhead transport protocols are needed for multimedia application like Videoconferencing.

This greatly enhances the productivity and quality of work at the same time reducing the cost of travelling.
