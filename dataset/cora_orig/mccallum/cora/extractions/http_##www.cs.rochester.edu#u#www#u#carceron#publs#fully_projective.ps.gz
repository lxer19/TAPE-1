Reference-contexts: Often some geometrical invariants of these points (such as their relative spatial positions, in the case of a rigid object) are known in advance. Algebraic solutions with perspective camera models have been proposed for several variations of this problem <ref> [1; 22; 17; 8; 20; 5; 10; 12; 6] </ref>. However, the resulting techniques usually work only with a limited number of points and are thus sensitive to additive noise and erroneous matching. <p> Similar results were obtained for the other five parameter-space errors. To assure that the results did not depend on symmetries in the cubical imaged object, we repeated the same tests with an asymmetric object whose eight points were all uniformly sampled in the space <ref> [1; 1] </ref> 3 and then scaled for a maximum edge size of 25 focal lengths.

Reference-contexts: We present and comparatively evaluate the resulting fully projective solution. It preserves the appealing properties of Lowe's original conception while performing substantially better than either approximation. Section 7 relates our findings to previous speculations on and analyses of Lowe's algorithm. This note is an abbreviation of <ref> [2] </ref>, which is less terse and contains more experimental results. 2 Lowe's Algorithm Lowe's original algorithm [15; 14; 13] addresses the issue of viewpoint and model parameter computation, 1 given a known 3-D object and the corresponding im-age. It assumes that the imaging process is a projective transformation. <p> In Lowe's approximation, we use the depth of the center of the object in the camera frame as the multiplicative factor that yields the values of d x and d y . All the methods are tested with exactly the same poses and initial conditions <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> A formal definition of these parameters and of the whole sampling methodology is given in <ref> [2] </ref>. Unless stated otherwise, three average values are chosen for each of those parameters (Table 5). <p> In this note we usually present only the average error and its standard deviation and the results with the exclusion of the upper and lower 25% of the errors. For more error measures and more statistics see <ref> [2] </ref>. 6.1 Convergence in the General Case Initially, we tried to compare the speed of convergence and final accuracy of each method with arbitrary poses and initial conditions. The statistics for the NDE, based on 13,500 executions per method, are plotted in Fig. 1. <p> After that, the internal loop (in Matlab) for Lowe's method (which is the simplest of the three) contained only four floating point operations less than the internal loop of the fully projective solution. We measured the execution times of 20 iterations of each method (details in <ref> [2] </ref>). The statistics shown in Fig. 4 were gathered from a set of 13,500 runs per method, performed with the same sampling techniques employed in the convergence experiments. <p> The explanation is that a careful subexpres-sion factorization can save us the work that Ishii's simplifications are designed to save, so we pay no time penalty for a solution that is less sensitive to the proximity of singularities <ref> [2] </ref>. 6.4 Sensitivity to Depth in Object Center Position We also performed some experiments to check the sensitivity of the techniques to individual variations 6 Section 6), with respect to the number of iterations of Lowe's (solid line), Ishii's (dotted line), and our fully projective solution (dash-dotted line). <p> The resulting formulation is compared with formulations by Lowe and Ishii [11] that approximate the fully projective case. Many experiments based on different scenaria are presented here, and more are available in <ref> [2] </ref>. Lowe's approximation was discussed by McIvor [16]. He states that assuming that d x and d y are constants amounts to an affine approximation.

Reference-contexts: But as we show in Section 6, the fully projective formulation is actually more stable except in situations that break the other two formulations tested as well. Bray <ref> [3] </ref> uses Lowe's algorithm without discussing the approximation. Worrall et al. [21] compare their algorithm for perspective inversion with Lowe's algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Pioneering work by Lowe [15; 14; 13] and Gennery [7] addressed the problem in a projective framework. Lowe showed that the direct use of numerical optimization techniques is an effective way to overcome the lack of robustness that makes the traditional analytical techniques infeasible in practice. DeMenthon and Davis <ref> [4; 18] </ref> and Horaud et al. [9] propose techniques that start with weak- or para-perspective solutions, respectively, and refine them iteratively to recover the full-perspective pose. Phong, Horaud et al. [19] showed that it is possible to decouple completely the recovery of rotational pose parameters from their translational counterparts. <p> A more general approach, which we follow here, is to use a weaker camera model to generate an initial solution for the problem analytically, and then use the projective iterative solution (s) to refine this initial estimate. This approach was suggested by DeMenthon and Davis <ref> [4] </ref>, who introduced a way of describing the discrepancy between a weak-perspective solution and the full-perspective pose with a set of parameters that can then be refined numerically, yielding the latter from the former.
