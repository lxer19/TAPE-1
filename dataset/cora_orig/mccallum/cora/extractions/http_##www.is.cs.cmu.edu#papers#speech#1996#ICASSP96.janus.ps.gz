Abstract: JANUS II is a research system to design and test components of speech to speech translation systems as well as a research prototype for such a system. We will focus on two aspects of the system: 1) new features and recognition performance of the speech recognition component JANUS-SR and 2) the end-to-end performance of JANUS II, including a comparison of two machine translation strategies used for JANUS-MT (PHOENIX and GLR*).
