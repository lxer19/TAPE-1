Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of finding the worst case end-to-end delay and buffer occupancy bounds in networks of rate-controlled, non-work conserving servers. The calculations are based on a simple fluid model, but care is taken so that the computed delay and buffer occupancy values are upper bounds on actual values. A simple algorithm is presented to perform these calculations in linear time. Simulation results compare the computed worst case delays with the actual delays obtained on some simple network topologies. The algorithm is found to predict node delays well for bursty input traffic, but poorly for hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh A.

Buffer requirements are predicted well in both cases.

Reference-contexts: We present a novel graphical analysis technique and compare the predicted delay and buffer requirements with simulation results. The analysis extends to a series of Stop-and-Go servers <ref> [Gol90] </ref> as well. 2. Model of the Network In our model a channel is associated with a static path through the network and has state and reserved resources at each switch (node) along this path.

Reference-contexts: If there are fewer than chunksize cells in the queue for the channel, the server will send out the available cells, then use the free slots for non-real time traffic. One example of such servers are those that obey the Hierarchical Round Robin (HRR) service discipline <ref> [KKK90] </ref>. HRR servers maintain of a hierarchy of round robin frames, so that a choice of frametimes is available during channel establishment.

Reference-contexts: Since HRR servers do not provide delay jitter guarantees, we would like to see how much delay jitter is introduced by doing HRR instead of, say, Stop-and-Go service. All simulations were performed using the REAL simulator <ref> [Kes88] </ref>. The simulation topology is simple a series of switches from a source to a destination (Figure 7). Sources send rate-controlled traffic, that is, traffic that can be characterized by the parameters x min , x ave and I.

Reference-contexts: I The averaging interval for calculating x ave . Recent work has shown that this model accurately describes most types of rate-controlled traffic expected in high-speed networks <ref> [Ver91] </ref>. We assume that the user of the channel is bound to obey these restrictions on the input traffic, and the delay and buffer values calculated need only hold if these restrictions are not violated. 2.3.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Recent work has shown that framed, non-work-conserving servers can provide end-to-end delay bounds to users who need strict guarantees on network performance <ref> [ZhaKes91] </ref>. By framed we mean that the servers work on the basis of an interval, called the frametime, during which they allocate a number of transmission slots to each channel being served. Each slot corresponds to the transmission of a fixed size packet or cell on the output trunk. <p> HRR servers maintain of a hierarchy of round robin frames, so that a choice of frametimes is available during channel establishment. While earlier work considered the behavior of a single HRR server [KKK 90], and of a channel traversing a sequence of identical servers <ref> [ZhaKes91] </ref>, the general case, where the frame-time could be different at each server, and the input traffic could be bursty, was not analyzed. This paper determines the upper bound on the end-to-end queueing delays and buffer requirements of a simplex channel established over any sequence of HRR servers.
