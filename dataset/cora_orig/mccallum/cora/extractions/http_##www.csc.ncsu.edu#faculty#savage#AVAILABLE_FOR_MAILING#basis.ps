Abstract: We study basis partitions, introduced by Hansraj Gupta in 1978. For this family of partitions, we give a recurrence, a generating function, identities relating basis partitions to more familiar families of partitions, and a new characterization of basis partitions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In a 1978 paper <ref> [1] </ref>, Hansraj Gupta introduced an interesting class of integer partitions called basis partitions. An integer partition is a basis partition if, in the class of all partitions with its rank vector (see below), its weight is minimum. <p> The Durfee square of is the largest square subarray of dots in the Ferrers graph of . Let d () denote the size (number of rows) of the Durfee square of . As in <ref> [1] </ref>, define the rank vector of , r () = [ 1 0 2 ; : : : ; d () 0 fl Supported by the National Science Foundation through the CRA Distributed Mentor Project, 1995 y Supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant No. <p> Note that a given rank vector is associated with infinitely many partitions. For example, the partitions ff = (13; 7; 7; 6; 4; 3; 3; 2; 2; 1) and fi = (12; 6; 5; 5; 3; 2; 2; 2; 1) of 48 and 38, respectively, both have rank vector <ref> [3; 2; 0; 1] </ref>. However, Gupta shows in [1] that for every rank vector, r, there is a unique partition , for which jj is minimum over all partitions with rank vector r. This partition is called the basis partition of r. <p> For example, the partitions ff = (13; 7; 7; 6; 4; 3; 3; 2; 2; 1) and fi = (12; 6; 5; 5; 3; 2; 2; 2; 1) of 48 and 38, respectively, both have rank vector [3; 2; 0; 1]. However, Gupta shows in <ref> [1] </ref> that for every rank vector, r, there is a unique partition , for which jj is minimum over all partitions with rank vector r. This partition is called the basis partition of r. <p> rank vector <ref> [3; 2; 0; 1] </ref>. However, Gupta shows in [1] that for every rank vector, r, there is a unique partition , for which jj is minimum over all partitions with rank vector r. This partition is called the basis partition of r. For example, the basis partition of [3; 2; 0; 1] is (10; 5; 5; 5; 3; 2; 2). Call a partition of n basic if it is the basis partition of its associated rank vector and let B (n) be the set of all basic partitions of n. <p> Of the 42 partitions of 10, only 16 are basic and these are shown in Fig. 1. We consider the empty partition to be a basic partition of n = 0. In the next section, we review some results on basis partitions from <ref> [1] </ref> and use them to derive a generating function and recurrence for b (n; d), the number of basis partitions of n with Durfee square of size d. <p> Equality in case i = d occurs if and only if x d = d or if x d = x d y d + d, that is, y d = d. 2 Finally, Gupta <ref> [1] </ref> notes the following bijection, where p (n; d) denotes the number of partitions of n into at most d parts. Theorem 2 [Gupta] Let r = [r 1 ; : : : r d ] and let = [x; y] d be the basis partition of r.
