Abstract: This paper proposes a family of protocols iKP (i = 1; 2; 3) for secure electronic payments over the Internet. The protocols implement credit card-based transactions between the customer and the merchant while using the existing financial network for clearing and authorization. The protocols can be extended to apply to other payment models, such as debit cards and electronic checks. They are based on public-key cryptography and can be implemented in either software or hardware. Individual protocols differ in key management complexity and degree of security. It is intended that their deployment be gradual and incremental.

Reference-contexts: While 1KP is very simple, it does not offer non-repudiation for messages sent by customers and merchants; this means that disputes about the authenticity of payment orders are not easily resolvable. Some consequences of missing non-repudiation for payment systems are illustrated in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2KP asks that merchants, in addition to acquirer gateways, hold public key-pairs and public key certificates. The protocol is can then provide non-repudiation for messages originated by merchants.

Reference-contexts: Formally, the primitive we has the property that correct decryption convinces the decryptor that the transmitter "knows" the plaintext that was encrypted. In particular, tampering with ciphertext is detectable. A simple scheme to achieve such plaintext-aware encryption using RSA is described in Appendix A, based on the scheme of <ref> [2] </ref>. We stress that such encryption does not provide authentication in the manner of a signature, i.e., it does not provide non-repudiation. But it can be made to provide an authentication like capability between parties sharing a key (such as the CAN or PIN).

Reference-contexts: For example, [12] uses public-key cryptography between merchant and gateway, and the protocol sketched in [9] appears cryptographically similar to 2KP.

Finally, there are some general security schemes for the World Wide Web, most notably, SHTTP [18] and SSL [14]. Both have been suggested as a basis for secure electronic payments. SHTTP is a possible platform for implementing iKP.

Reference-contexts: One of the biggest concerns is that of an adversary breaking into an acquirer computer through the Internet connection. Therefore, the acquirer's computer must be protected with the utmost care; including a very limited Internet connection using advanced firewall technology (e.g., <ref> [8, 7] </ref>.) Furthermore, the trust in the acquirer's computer must be limited, so that a break in would have a limited effect only. 4 Security Requirements In this section we consider a range of potential requirements for each party involved in the payment process: issuer/acquirer, merchant, and customer.

Reference-contexts: The use of encryption in iKP is limited to well-defined payment data credit card numbers and PINs and the interfaces to cryptographic primitives can be designed in a way that makes them inaccessible to the end-user. Therefore, we expect that iKP (at least specific implementations as sketched in <ref> [13] </ref>) will not be subject to US export regulations. We note that, for countries outside North America, there is absolutely no incentive to use payment systems with re stricted or weakened security. A specific software-only architecture used for implementing a prototype of iKP is described in [13]. <p> implementations as sketched in <ref> [13] </ref>) will not be subject to US export regulations.

All iKP protocols are based on the existing credit-card payment system. The parties in the payment system are shown in Figure 1.

Since iKP aims at credit-card-like payments, no anonymity against the payment system is provided.
