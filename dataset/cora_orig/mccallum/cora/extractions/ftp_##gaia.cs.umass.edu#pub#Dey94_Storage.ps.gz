Abstract: Multimedia information systems are an essential component of several multimedia applications ranging from media entertainment to on-line library systems. However, the bandwidth available on traditional workstation-based I/O systems is not sufficient to be able to support hundreds of multimedia information streams. In this paper, we discuss our approach to build a storage subsystem in a multimedia server which can deliver variable-bit-rate audio/video data streams to several hundred clients simultaneously over a high-speed broadband network. Our approach is to distribute the bandwidth requirement across multiple disks in a disk-array architecture. We address issues of multimedia data layout on this disk subsystem. The large sizes of audio/video data requires them to be always disk-resident. Thus disk-retrieval at appropriate times is crucial to maintain sustained delivery rates as well as just-in-time delivery. Explicit knowledge of data-access behavior of clients is exploited to design a scheduling mechanism which maintains just-in-time delivery characteristics. To assist the scheduling mechanism in maintaining guarantees, an admission control policy is implemented which allows/rejects additional clients to access the storage subsystem based on its current workload. Both the scheduling and the admission control mechanisms take into acount the variable-bit-rate characteristics of the data.
