Title: A Theory of the Acquisition of Episodic Memory  
Author: Carlos Ramirez and Roger Cooley

Abstract: Case-based reasoning (CBR) has been viewed by many as just a methodology for building systems, but the foundations of CBR are psychological theories. Dynamic Memory (Schank, 1982) was the first attempt to describe a theory for learning in computers and people, based on particular forms of data structures and processes, that nowadays are widely used in a variety of forms in CBR. In addition to being useful for system building, CBR provides a way of discussing a range of issues concerned with cognition. This focus on the practical uses of CBR has deflected attention from the need to develop further the underlying theory. In particular, the issue of knowledge acquisition, in not adequately handled by the existing theory. This paper discusses this theoretical weakness and then proposes an enhanced model of learning which is compatible with the CBR paradigm.

Reference-contexts: These findings are in line with previous predictions by Craik and Lockhart (1972), and Hyde and Jenkins <ref> (1973) </ref> (both studies in Eysenck and Keane, 1995), whom proposed that: 1. The level or depth of processing of a stimulus has substantial effects on its memorability. 2. Deeper levels of analysis produce more elaborate, longer lasting, and stronger memory traces than do shallow levels of analysis.

Reference-contexts: The level or depth of processing of a stimulus has substantial effects on its memorability. 2. Deeper levels of analysis produce more elaborate, longer lasting, and stronger memory traces than do shallow levels of analysis. Craik and Tulving's <ref> (1975) </ref> experiments suggest that elaboration of processing of some kind and the amount of elaboration are also important factors in determining long-term memory. Another criticism of dynamic memory theory stems from Schank's proposition of "automatic reminding".
