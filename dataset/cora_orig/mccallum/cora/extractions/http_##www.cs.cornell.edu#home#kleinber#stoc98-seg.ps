Title: Segmentation Problems  
Author: Jon Kleinberg Christos Papadimitriou Prabhakar Raghavan 
Abstract: We introduce and study a novel genre of optimization problems, which we call segmentation problems. Our motivation, in part, is the development of a framework for evaluating certain data mining and clustering operations in terms of their utility in decision-making. For any classical optimization problem, the corresponding segmentation problem seeks to partition a set of cost vectors into several segments, so that the overall cost is optimized. This framework contains a number of standard combinatorial clustering problems as special cases, and many segmentation problems turn out to be maxsnp-complete even when the corresponding "unsegmented" version is easy to solve. We develop approximation algorithms for two natural and interesting problems in this class | the hypercube segmentation problem and the catalog segmentation problem | and present a general greedy scheme, which can be specialized to approximate a large class of segmentation problems. Finally, we indicate some connections to local search, game theory, and sensitivity analysis in linear programming.

This phrasing of the problem resembles the maximization problem for monotone submodu-lar functions, studied by Cornuejols, Fisher, and Nemhauser <ref> [10] </ref> and Nemhauser, Wolsey, and Fisher [19]; we drew a different but related connection to this work in Section 3.2.
