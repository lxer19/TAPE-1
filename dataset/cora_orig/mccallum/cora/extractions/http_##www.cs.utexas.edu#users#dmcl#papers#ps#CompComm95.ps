Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive admission control algorithm, in which a client is admitted for service by a multimedia server only if the extrapolation from the past measurements of the storage server performance characteristics indicate that the service requirements of all the clients can be met satisfactorily. Each client may request the retrieval of a variable bit rate (VBR) encoded media stream and may require a different quality of service. We also present a disk scheduling algorithm that minimizes both seek time and rotational latency incurred while accessing a sequence of media blocks from disk. We examine the effects of a finite read-ahead on the quality of service provided to each admitted client. The effectiveness of the admission control and disk scheduling algorithms is demonstrated through extensive simulations.

Reference-contexts: If the entire clientele of a multimedia server desires deterministic service guarantees (i.e., their continuous playback requirements should never be violated for the entire service duration), the corresponding admission control algorithm will be characterized by worst-case assumptions regarding service time <ref> [1, 7, 8, 14, 18, 19, 21] </ref>. Notice, however, that due to the human perceptual tolerances as well as the inherent redundancy in continuous media streams, most clients of a multimedia server are tolerant to brief distortions in playback continuity as well as occasional loss of media information. <p> Clearly, since the clients retrieving strands S 1 ; S 2 ; :::; S n d require deterministic service guarantees, we get: 8i : i 2 <ref> [1; n d ] </ref> : ff i = 1. On the other hand, for all the tolerant clients, 0 &lt; ff i &lt; 1. <p> To illustrate, consider a multimedia server that employs a SCAN disk scheduling algorithm [4, 17]. Let 8i 2 <ref> [1; n] </ref> : k max i denote the maximum number of media blocks that may contain f i frames of strand S i . <p> z j starting from location z i , then a sequence for retrieving N media blocks can be considered optimal if it minimizes the sum: = (z 0 ; ! 1 ) + (! 1 ; ! 2 ) + + (! N1 ; ! N ) where 8i 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref> : ! i 2 fz 1 ; z 2 ; :::; z N g, and 8j 2 [1; N ]; j 6= i : ! i 6= ! j . The sequence ! 1 ; ! 2 ; :::; ! N denotes the retrieval sequence. <p> if it minimizes the sum: = (z 0 ; ! 1 ) + (! 1 ; ! 2 ) + + (! N1 ; ! N ) where 8i 2 <ref> [1; N ] </ref> : ! i 2 fz 1 ; z 2 ; :::; z N g, and 8j 2 [1; N ]; j 6= i : ! i 6= ! j . The sequence ! 1 ; ! 2 ; :::; ! N denotes the retrieval sequence.

Reference-contexts: A multimedia server that employs such an algorithm is referred to as providing predictive service guarantees to clients <ref> [3, 10] </ref>. Such an algorithm offers fairly reliable service but no absolute guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Due to variable rate compression, the number of frames contained in a media block may vary from one media block to another. Successive blocks of a strand are assumed to be stored on disk using the random placement model <ref> [11] </ref>. The greedy disk scheduling algorithm (presented in Section 4) was employed for all the simulations. The playback rate of each video strand is assumed to be 30 frames/sec. Furthermore, 30 frames of each video strand are assumed to be retrieved during each round, yielding R = 1 sec.

Reference-contexts: We refer to a continuously recorded sequence of audio samples or video frames as a strand. A multimedia server can organize the storage of media strands on disk in terms of fixed size media blocks <ref> [13] </ref>. Due to the periodic nature of media playback, a multimedia server can service multiple clients simultaneously by proceeding in rounds, retrieving media blocks for each client during each round.

Reference-contexts: The fundamental limitation of these algorithms, however, is that they optimize only the seek time, and completely ignore the rotational latency. To address this limitation, Seltzer et al. <ref> [15] </ref> have recently proposed a Shortest Access Time First (SATF) algorithm, in which data blocks are accessed from disk in a order that simultaneously minimizes both seek time and rotational latency. In this paper, we propose a near optimal algorithm for deriving such a retrieval sequence. <p> Consequently, disk scheduling algorithms which optimize only the seek time (e.g., SCAN, SSTF, etc.) may incur significant rotational latencies during the retrieval of a sequence of blocks from disk. To address this limitation, Seltzer et al. <ref> [15] </ref> have recently proposed a Shortest Access Time First (SATF) disk scheduling algorithm that derives a sequence for accessing media blocks from disk by simultaneously minimizing both seek and rotational latency incurred during retrieval. <p> Finally, we have also compared the performance of the greedy disk scheduling algorithm proposed in this paper with the Shortest Access Time First (SATF) algorithm proposed by Seltzer et al. <ref> [15] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The number of media blocks of a strand retrieved during a round is dependent on its playback rate requirement, as well as the buffer space availability at the client <ref> [19] </ref>.

Hence, instead of deriving an optimal sequence for accessing media blocks, we present a greedy algorithm which, in practice, derives near-optimal retrieval sequences.
