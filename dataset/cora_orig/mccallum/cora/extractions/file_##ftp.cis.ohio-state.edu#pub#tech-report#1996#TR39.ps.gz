Title: An Efficient Protocol for Call Setup and Path Migration in IEEE 802.6 Based Personal Communication Networks  
Author: Xuefeng Dong and Ten-Hwang Lai 
Affiliation: Department of Computer and Information Science The Ohio State University  
Abstract: Recently, DQDB (IEEE 802.6) MAN has been proposed as a component of the Personal Communication Networks, in which base stations of wireless infrastructures are connected by a number of DQDBs which in turn are connected by bridges. We propose a protocol for call setup and path migration in a cluster of DQDBs. To pursue simplicity, efficiency, and fastness in path setup, we use a link-state-like routing method for path selection, and a source-routing-based protocol for path establishment. The feasibility of the source routing protocol in a DQDB cluster is guaranteed by our novel labeling scheme. Each label represents the routing direction from one DQDB to another such that a path can be represented by a sequence of labels. Because of the locality property of the labels, a few bits are enough to denote the labels unambiguously. Using multi-bit labels instead of multi-bye physical addresses, a path can be specified in a 53-octet DQDB slot.

Reference-contexts: Examining the content of each type of message used in the proposed protocol, we find that path is the only field that may be too long to fit in a slot. 15 An offset routing protocol <ref> [1, 14] </ref> was proposed to alleviate this problem. Instead of listing the full physical address of each network segment, only an offset (i.e. a part) of it is used to achieve a shorter path representation. There are two drawbacks of the "offset" method.

Reference-contexts: Compared with a previous scheme, our protocol is simpler, and performs better in terms of blocking rate and setup delay. Although the proposed labeling scheme and path setup protocol were presented in the setting of DQDB networks, they are actually applicable to other bridge-connected LANs/MANs such as FDDI-II <ref> [2] </ref> and FDDI Follow on LAN [12].

Reference-contexts: We examine each of these methods in the following. Transparent bridges and source routing bridges are the two IEEE standardized routing bridges. The spanning-tree routing algorithm assumes that LANs or MANs are connected by transparent bridges <ref> [3] </ref>. A spanning tree is constructed on a bipartite graph where each node represents a LAN or a bridge. All messages are delivered via edges of the tree.

Reference-contexts: In our application, an outdated path may even not be available any more because of the sudden lack of an isochronous channel in an intermediate DQDB. Distance vector and link-state are two general next-hop routing approaches <ref> [4] </ref>. In the distance vector routing approach, each node maintains a routing table of the shortest distance to other nodes through its neighboring nodes. By periodically exchanging information with its neighboring nodes, each node attempts to keep its routing table up-to-date.

Reference-contexts: DQDB BMN receives the confirm message, it can migrate the traffic from the old path to the new one. 2.2 Drawbacks of the DPBB Scheme The distance vector routing method, on which the DPBB scheme is based, is well known to have the drawback of forming short-lived and long-lived loops <ref> [5] </ref>. This is because nodes choose their next-hops in a completely distributed fashion based on possibly stale or even incorrect information. There are loop avoidance techniques available in the literature; they normally require inter-node coordination. The DPBB scheme alleviates the loop as well as stale information problem by parallel search. <p> vector approach is computationally more efficient, easier to implement and requires less storage space than the link-state approach, it is well known that it can cause the formation of routing loops because each node updates its routing table in a distributed fashion based on possibly stale or even incorrect information <ref> [5] </ref>. When applied to a cluster of DQDBs, the distance vector ap 9 proach naturally resulted in a scheme like DPBB [13]. As discussed in the previous section, it has several drawbacks.

Reference-contexts: Transparent bridge and its accompanying spanning tree routing algorithm are thus not suitable for our application.

There are four different routing directives [18]: null, nonbroadcast, single-route broadcast, and all-route broadcast. An optimal path from the source station to a destination can be found by all-route broadcast.

Path migration is discussed in section 5. Simulation results are shown in section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper. 2 Previous Work The Distributed Parallel Branch and Bound (DPBB) scheme for path migration has been proposed for the IEEE 802.6 based PCN <ref> [13] </ref>. We briefly review this scheme and discuss its drawbacks. 2.1 The DPBB Scheme The DPBB scheme is based on the distance-vector routing algorithm. Each DQDB i maintains at its BMN a routing table RT i and a path table P T i . <p> Efficient path selection is a key to reducing the call blocking rate. A call is blocked if it doesn't get the needed channels. Given that there are only a limited number of isochronous channels in a cluster of DQDBs, the previous work <ref> [13] </ref> attempts to choose a shortest path for each call so 7 as to minimize the number of isochronous channels consumed. This strategy, in a sense, assumes the same cost for all isochronous channels in all DQDBs. <p> When applied to a cluster of DQDBs, the distance vector ap 9 proach naturally resulted in a scheme like DPBB <ref> [13] </ref>. As discussed in the previous section, it has several drawbacks. In the link-state approach, each node maintains a view of the network topology with a cost for each link. Periodically, each node broadcasts the costs of its outgoing links to all other nodes using a protocol such as flooding. <p> The above definition of efficient path is different from that of <ref> [13] </ref> mainly in that here we take into consideration the traffic condition along a path, while [13] considers only its length. When a new path to a destination DQDB is needed, the source BMN will compute the most efficient path to the destination. <p> The above definition of efficient path is different from that of <ref> [13] </ref> mainly in that here we take into consideration the traffic condition along a path, while [13] considers only its length.

Setup of a new path (step 2) and release of the old path (step 4) can be accomplished using the proposed path setup protocol. For traffic migration from the old path to the new path (step 3), interested readers are referred to <ref> [13, 16] </ref> for discussions. In this section, we discuss when to initiate a path migration (step 1). <p> When mobile host Y roams to a neighboring DQDB, the path is elongated and becomes inefficient. A migration to the shorter path (the dotted one) is desirable. This kind of occasion that calls for path migration has been discussed in <ref> [13] </ref> Even without handoff, a path may become inefficient and entails a migration. Figure 7 illustrates two such scenarios. In the first case, an efficient path become inefficient when a DQDB on the path becomes CONGESTED or FULL. <p> of tearing down the connection, a forced path migration will save the connection. 21 6 Simulation In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed path setup and path migration protocol in comparison with the DPBB scheme, we simulate both protocols in the same simulation model with the same assumptions <ref> [13] </ref>. A Manhattan-style network model with a size of 10 fl 10 is considered here as shown in Fig. 9. The rectangle mesh topology is chosen because cables are likely installed under streets, which is likely to happen in the real world.

Reference-contexts: Many schemes have been proposed for this problem (e.g., [15]). In this paper, we assume that the callee has been located and we are in the process of setting up a path. As setting up virtual connections in ATM networks has been widely discussed in the literature (e.g., <ref> [17] </ref>), we will focus on the setup of a path (or subpath) in a cluster of DQDBs. As mentioned above, such a path passes through one or more DQDBs and requires an isochronous channel in each of the DQDBs (on the path).
