It is enough to prove the invariance condition for positive intervals rff. The 34 the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is divided into 2 3 , 2 5 , and 2 8 Stern-Brocot intervals of the same depth, and then slopes are converted to angles in the interval [0; =2]. The area above an interval gives its measure under -f . <p> For a typical example, choose 1 0 with probability p, 0 &lt; p &lt; 1, and 1 1 with probability 1 p. In this example, the invariant measure over directions parameterized by slopes is supported on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, the slope m is mapped to 1=(1 + m) and 1 + 1=m respectively, and the ranges of those two maps ( [0; 1] and [1; 1] ) are disjoint. <p> In this example, the invariant measure over directions parameterized by slopes is supported on <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, the slope m is mapped to 1=(1 + m) and 1 + 1=m respectively, and the ranges of those two maps ( [0; 1] and [1; 1] ) are disjoint.

The second choice with the same and fi but = 40 is less common [31] [35] [51]. <p> The Jacobian @x (t) @x 0 in (5.1) was approximated using automatic differentiation and appropriate scaling. as 1:51 in <ref> [2] </ref> which is also off by about :01.

The only one of these papers to give an estimate of the error is [2], where it is correctly implied that the value 1:51 can be off by about :01. We note that the error in fl 1 as reported in Table 5.1 is only :00008. <p> Besides, the rate of convergence of (5.1) as t ! 1 is very slow; it is about t 1=2 for the Lorenz equations as we show in Section 5.3 or as reported in <ref> [2] </ref>. Thus, unsurprisingly, the errors in most published calculations of the Lyapunov exponents are mainly due to the finite length of integration. The length of integration we use for the Lorenz equations, T = 10 7 , is far longer than in any previous calculation we are aware of. <p> There is evidence in the next section to conclude that the convergence is like t 1=2 as t increases beyond 10000. Abarbanel, et al. <ref> [2] </ref> came to the same conclusion using numerical experiments performed from a different perspective. The convergence to fl 2 as t ! 1 is like t 1 . The discretized dynamical system also seems to contract volume at a constant rate like the Lorenz equations. <p> The slow convergence as t ! 1 is because of variation in the local rate of divergence of trajectories on the surface of the attractor. The variation of the local rates of divergence on the surface of a strange attractor is studied with several examples by Abarbanel, et al. <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The relevant expression for the beta function B (x; y) is Equation (6.2.1) in <ref> [4] </ref>. Also, if x is chosen from the standard Cauchy distribution, then fl ~ = E ((1 + x 2 ) ~=2 ). We do not need fl ~ in terms of the beta function, however; the integral expression (4.7) is more suitable for our purposes.

Reference-contexts: For a description of the numerical method, sometimes called Ulam's method, see [43] or [66]. Theorem 2.6 above is the main result of this chapter. We arrived at Theorem 2.6 using Lemma 2.5 and rounding error analysis. An alternative is to use interval arithmetic to validate the computation <ref> [5] </ref>. Instead of rounding the computations to the nearest floating point number, interval arithmetic carefully rounds the various stages of the computation either upwards or downwards to compute a lower bound for p d and an upper bound for q d .

Reference-contexts: four color theorem (all planar graphs can be colored using only four colors so that no two adjacent vertices have the same color) by Appel, Haken and Koch caused controversy and aroused great interest because it relied on producing and checking 1834 graphs using 1200 hours of 1976 computer time <ref> [6] </ref> [73]. In spite of improvements (for example, the number 1834 was brought down to 1482 soon afterwards by Appel and Haken themselves), all proofs of the four color theorem still rely on the computer. Computer assisted proofs are more common now.

These different interpretations amount merely to a change of vocabulary as far as the computation of fl f is concerned; but each interpretation offers a different point of view.

Reference-contexts: Now the Lyapunov exponent (x 0 ; !) = lim sup logkx (t; !)k t can depend on both x 0 and !. The ergodic theory of linear stochastic systems such as this has been worked out in <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Let us mention at the outset the great debt that this introduction owes to the excellent article by Arnold and Wihstutz <ref> [9] </ref>. <p> It is possible to choose a nested sequence of subspaces 0 = V d = = V 1 = R d such that the Lyapunov exponent fl (x 0 ) for any x 0 in V k V k+1 is fl k <ref> [9] </ref> [96]. 4 The Lyapunov exponents fl i can also be defined using a matrix product. The solution x (t) of the linearized equation (1.3) at t &gt; s can be written as x (t) = M (t; s)x (s), where M (t; s) 2 R d;d . <p> The system (1.3) is said to be regular if d X fl i = lim inf logjdet M (t)j t According to Arnold and Wihstutz <ref> [9] </ref>, a stronger version of regularity together with fl 1 &lt; 0 implies the asymptotic stability of (1.2).

Reference-contexts: Bellman <ref> [10, 1952] </ref> initiated the study of random matrix products M n : : : M 1 , where each M i is independent and identically distributed over R d;d . Thanks mainly to Furstenberg's remarkable work 13 [47, 1963] 1 , the theory in this situation is very well developed. <p> These different interpretations amount merely to a change of vocabulary as far as the computation of fl f is concerned; but each interpretation offers a different point of view. The study of random matrix products, initiated by Bellman <ref> [10, 1954] </ref>, has led to many deep results and applications. Applications have been made to areas as diverse as Schrodinger operators, image generation, and demography [29][34][112]. Our own interest in random recurrences was aroused by their connection to random triangular 25 matrices described in Chapter 4.

Reference-contexts: But, unfortunately, SRB measures are not known to exist in great generality. In every case where the existence of an SRB measure has been proven, the proof seems to involve a detailed knowledge of the dynamics <ref> [11] </ref> [18]. Further, SRB measures may not always exist, 9 and some physical measures may not be SRB [38]. We might ask what ergodic theory does for deterministic dynamical systems.

Similar calculations are commonly used as numerical evidence for chaos [85] [105]. The literature on computing Lyapunov exponents is extensive <ref> [12] </ref> [35] [36] [38] [50] [51] [57] [95].

Reference-contexts: If the initial conditions M (0) is taken as the d fi d identity matrix, M (t) will be equal to @x (t) @x 0 . This approach is clearly explained in [38]. We used automatic differentiation [58] <ref> [14] </ref> of the numerical ODE solver that approximately computed x (t) from x 0 to approximate @x (t) @x 0 and thus avoided the extra set of matrix differential equations. <p> There is no explanation why this is so, in part because there is no perturbation theory for Lyapunov exponents in this situation. respect to x (0) as t ! 1. The higher derivatives were computed using the automatic differentiation package ADOL-C <ref> [14] </ref>. The exponential increase shown in Figure 5.2 is not surprising. Since the trajectory x (t) itself is exponentially sensitive to small changes in x (0), all derivatives of x (t) with respect to x (0) also have to be exponentially sensitive to changes in x (0).

Reference-contexts: Since ~ &gt; 0, P (T k &lt; m k ) = P (T ~ k &gt; m ~k ). Use Lemma 4.4 with ~ = ~ to obtain an expression for E (T ~ k ) and apply Markov's inequality <ref> [15] </ref>.

The definition of almost sure convergence for a sequence of random variables can be found in textbooks on probability, for example <ref> [15] </ref> [19]. Roughly, it means that the convergence holds for a set of sequences of measure 1. Lemma 4.7. kL n k 1=n 2 ! 1 almost surely as n ! 1. 75 Proof. The proof is easy. We provide only an outline. <p> The Frobenius norm of L n , kL n k 2 F , is a sum of n (n + 1)=2 independent 2 variables of mean 1.

Reference-contexts: The elements of the theory of random matrix products are carefully explained in the beautiful monograph by Bougerol <ref> [17] </ref>. The basic result about Lyapunov exponents, lim logkM n : : : M 1 k n = fl 1 with probability 1; was proved by Furstenberg and Kesten [48]. Furstenberg [47] presented conditions for strict separation between the Lyapunov exponents fl 1 fl d . <p> Known results from the theory of random matrix products imply that logkM n : : : M 1 k n n jt n j ! e fl f as n ! 1; (2.3) for some constant fl f with probability 1 <ref> [17, p. 11, p. 157] </ref>. Our aim is to determine fl f or e fl f exactly. Theorem 2.6 realizes this aim by showing that e fl f = 21 1:13198824 : : : . <p> One of the applications Kingman refers to is the general problem of finding fl for random matrix products. For this and other applications, Kingman's problem is 22 still unsolved. Bougerol <ref> [17, p. 33] </ref> and Lima and Rahibe [78] calculate fl for some examples. The work of Chassaing, Letac and Mora [23] is closer to our determination of fl f . But in all their examples, the matrices, unlike B in (2.1), have only non-negative entries. <p> in (2.1) can both be thought of as Mobius transformations of the complex plane; then the random matrix product and the exponential growth of jt n j in (2.2) and (2.3) correspond to the dynamics of complex numbers acted upon by a composition of the Mobius transformations A and B <ref> [17, p. 38] </ref>. Also, the random walk on slopes m ! 1 + 1=m can be thought of as a random dynamical system [7]. <p> Furstenberg and Kesten [48, 1960], Furstenberg [47, 1963], Osseledac [90, 1968], Kingman [71, 1973], Guivarc'h and Raugi [60, 1985], and Le Page [76, 1982] [77, 1989] are some of the profound contributions to this area. We enthusiastically recommend the lucid, elegant and well-organized account by Bougerol <ref> [17] </ref>. For a more modern treatment, see [13]. For the basics of probability, our favorite is Breiman [19]. 2.2 Furstenberg's Formula To determine fl f , we use a formula from the theory of random matrix products that complements (2.2). <p> 2 , amp (x), which is a smooth function of x (Figure on p. 27), and -f (x), which is a probability measure over directions x (Figure 2.4) | combine to give a formula for fl f : fl f = amp (x)d-f (x): (2.4) This formula, derived by Furstenberg <ref> [17, p. 77] </ref>, is the basis of our determination of fl f . Directions x can be parameterized using angles, x = sin with 2 (=2; =2], or using slopes, x = m with m 2 (1; 1]. <p> We also say that -f is f -invariant. For the existence and uniqueness of -f , see <ref> [17, p. 10, p. 32] </ref>. It is also known that -f must be continuous [17, p. 32], i.e., -f (fxg) = 0 for any fixed direction x. <p> We also say that -f is f -invariant. For the existence and uniqueness of -f , see [17, p. 10, p. 32]. It is also known that -f must be continuous <ref> [17, p. 32] </ref>, i.e., -f (fxg) = 0 for any fixed direction x. <p> The reason is | -f is obviously a continuous measure, every rational appears in the Stern-Brocot tree at a finite depth by Lemma 2.1c, and the rationals are dense in R. For the uniqueness of -f , see <ref> [17, p. 31] </ref>. It is enough to prove the invariance condition for positive intervals rff. <p> To show that -f is a fractal, it is necessary to prove that 0 &lt; dim (-f ) &lt; 1. It is known that 0 &lt; dim (-f ) <ref> [17, p. 162] </ref>. David Allwright of Oxford University has shown us a short proof that -f is singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We note that Allwright's proof relies on Theorems 30 and 31 of Khintchine [70]. <p> We note that Allwright's proof relies on Theorems 30 and 31 of Khintchine [70]. The Hausdorff dimensions of very similar measures have been determined by Kinney and Pitcher [72]. There is also a conjecture by Ledrappier about dim (-f ) [75] <ref> [17, p. 162] </ref>. 37 fl f = 1:13198824 : : : Furstenberg's integral for fl f (2.6) can be written as fl f = 2 0 4 1 + 4m 4 because both the integrand and fare symmetric about 0. <p> None of the results in this chapter is original, but since their importance is so well established, we omit references to the original papers. The original papers 53 54 [47], [48], [60], [76] are all most remarkable. Bougerol's monograph <ref> [17] </ref> is detailed, comprehensive, and historically accurate. 3.1 Existence of Lyapunov Exponents and the The orem of Furstenberg and Kesten The following theorem is basic. For a real-valued function f , f + (x) = max (f (x); 0). Theorem 3.1. <p> Proof. Proposition 7.2 and the proof of item (iii) of Corollary 3.4 in Chapter 3 of <ref> [17] </ref> can be used in combination to conclude that 1 E log kxk ! fl 1 as n ! 1 uniformly in x 2 P (R d ). <p> Thus it suffices to prove the upper and lower bounds. 61 An easy calculation using Furstenberg's formula gives fl 1 = 1 E log kxk d-(x); where is-invariant; see <ref> [17] </ref>. The validity of the bounds is now obvious. Theorem 3.8 is the only original result in this chapter. We hasten to add that it is a trivial consequence of known results, though its relevance to the computation of fl 1 was unnoticed.

Reference-contexts: Our computation uses floating point arithmetic, which is inexact owing to rounding errors.

Lanford's proof of Feigenbaum's conjecture about the period doubling route to chaos used interval arithmetic [74]. The computer assisted proof of chaos in the Lorenz equations announced by Mischaikow and Mrozek [88] is another notable example.

Osseledac's theorem [90] <ref> [26] </ref> guarantees that the fl i (x) and v i (x) exist, that the matrix products are regular and that fl i (x) is a constant fl i almost surely with respect to .

If d n = 0, the distribution is said to be strictly stable. As usual, the distribution is symmetric if X has the same distribution as X. A symmetric, strictly stable distribution has exponent a if c n = n 1=a . <p> A symmetric, strictly stable distribution has exponent a if c n = n 1=a . A standard result of probability theory says that any stable distribution has an exponent 0 &lt; a 2. The normal distribution is stable with exponent a = 2 <ref> [45] </ref>. The techniques used for triangular matrices with normal entries work more generally when the entries are drawn from a symmetric, strictly stable distribution.

Reference-contexts: Bellman [10, 1952] initiated the study of random matrix products M n : : : M 1 , where each M i is independent and identically distributed over R d;d . Thanks mainly to Furstenberg's remarkable work 13 <ref> [47, 1963] </ref> 1 , the theory in this situation is very well developed. For example, as we will show in Chapter 3, there are simple algorithms for bounding the Lyapunov exponents in this setting. <p> The elements of the theory of random matrix products are carefully explained in the beautiful monograph by Bougerol [17]. The basic result about Lyapunov exponents, lim logkM n : : : M 1 k n = fl 1 with probability 1; was proved by Furstenberg and Kesten [48]. Furstenberg <ref> [47] </ref> presented conditions for strict separation between the Lyapunov exponents fl 1 fl d . Hasminski i's work on the stability of linear stochastic systems [63] was influenced by Furstenberg's paper. Carverhill [22] has generalized some results of Furstenberg to nonlinear stochastic systems. <p> Furstenberg and Kesten [48, 1960] showed that the limit exists under very general conditions. When it exists, the limit is usually denoted by fl and called the upper Lyapunov exponent. Furstenberg <ref> [47, 1963] </ref> showed that when the normalizing condition jdet M i j = 1 holds, as it does for f , "usually" fl &gt; 0. Furstenberg's theorem implies, for example, that fl f &gt; 0, and hence, that jt n j increases exponentially with n with probability 1. <p> In our opinion, the random Fibonacci recurrence is more natural than these examples. In fact, the random Fibonacci recurrence in a more general form appears as a motivating example in the very first paragraph of Furstenberg's famous paper <ref> [47] </ref>. In Section 2.2, we present a formula for fl f due to Furstenberg that forms the basis for this chapter. The matrices A and B map a direction in the real plane of slope m to directions of slope 1+1=m and 1+1=m, respectively. <p> Applications have been made to areas as diverse as Schrodinger operators, image generation, and demography [29][34][112].

We enthusiastically recommend the lucid, elegant and well-organized account by Bougerol [17].

We enthusiastically recommend the lucid, elegant and well-organized account by Bougerol [17]. For a more modern treatment, see [13]. <p> The Lyapunov exponents, fl 1 fl 2 fl d , are defined by fl i = lim 1 log i @x 0 ; (5.1) where i is the ith singular value with 1 being the 2-norm <ref> [90] </ref> [26]. Obviously, fl 1 &gt; 0 implies sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The right singular vectors of @x (t) @x 0 also converge as t ! 1, and the directions corresponding to positive Lyapunov exponents are called the stretching directions at x 0 .

Reference-contexts: Although topological methods have been more successful, the versatility and usefulness of numerical methods have not been matched by any kind of mathematics that is divorced from the computer. Many examples of chaos are described in [33], [59], <ref> [103] </ref>. The definitions of stability given in the previous section are not enough to understand chaos. But a different definition in the same framework can be used to quantify the sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

From Figure 5.3, it is clear that the convergence to fl 1 as t ! 1 is not very clean.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, the discretization errors in solving dx (t) dt = f (x) become as significant as errors due to the finite length of integration in computing Lyapunov exponents. Every numerical method approximates @x (t) dt = f (x) by a discrete dynamical system that is locally close to it <ref> [104] </ref>. The discretization error, which is the difference between the Lyapunov exponents of the continuous dynamical system and its discrete approximation, depends on the time step h of the numerical method. <p> Their conclusions were borne out by our numerical experiments, even though we implemented the suggestions in [35]. Therefore, we will not consider these continuous algorithms at all. It is well known that it is impossible to approximate trajectories of chaotic dynamical systems accurately as t ! 1 <ref> [104] </ref>. Since the top Lyapunov exponent is positive, even the inevitable local discretization errors are amplified exponentially in time. However, the numerical attractor usually approximates the actual strange attractor quite well [104]. 100 The situation for @x (t) @x 0 is similar. <p> is well known that it is impossible to approximate trajectories of chaotic dynamical systems accurately as t ! 1 <ref> [104] </ref>.

However, the numerical attractor usually approximates the actual strange attractor quite well [104]. 100 The situation for @x (t) @x 0 is similar. <p> If we consider one step to be taken by integrating for a fixed amount of time, say t = 1, then a numerical method of order r with a sufficiently small time step h approximates one step of the dynamics with an error of O (h r ) <ref> [104] </ref>. Thus if the Lyapunov exponents were to depend continuously on the dynamical system, they would change upon discretization by only about O (h r ). This argument cannot be made rigorous because examples with discontinuous dependence of the Lyapunov exponents on the parameters are known [38].

Accurate computation of Lyapunov exponents has received attention in the literature, but the effect of numerical discretization of continuous dynamical systems on their Lyapunov exponents has not been studied. <p> In fact, this length, which is more than a thousand times 1=fl 1 (the reciprocal of the top Lyapunov exponent), is quite long compared to most other calculations. For example, the numerical evidence for chaos in the solar system given by Sussman and Wisdom <ref> [105] </ref>, uses an integration length of only 100 97 million years, which is just 5 to 20 times 1=fl 1 for the solar system 2 . <p> But since IEEE double precision arithmetic allows for 16 digits of precision and it is typically hard to get even 3 or 4 digits of the Lyapunov exponents accurately, rounding errors are harmless. In their computations with the solar system, Sussman and Wisdom <ref> [105] </ref> implemented quadruple precision arithmetic only to realize that it was unnecessary. It is clear from the experiments in Figures 5.3 and 5.4 that computing the Lya-punov exponents accurately for the Lorenz equations requires a long integration, a higher order discretization and a short time step.

Reference-contexts: Advances in both theory and algorithms are perhaps necessary to elevate the use of Lyapunov exponents to a comparable level. 1.5 Issues in Computing Lyapunov Exponents How efficient and reliable can algorithms to compute Lyapunov exponents be? Algorithms to compute eigenvalues of matrices are remarkably efficient; Trefethen and Bau <ref> [109] </ref> explain that often computing eigenvalues in floating point arithmetic is as easy (or as hard) as solving a linear system. Though Lyapunov exponents in a sense generalize eigenvalues, this comparison is misleading. <p> Large rank one updates in turn cause more cancellation. Thus there seems to be a self-stabilizing mechanism. Trefethen and Bau have proposed yet another argument based on the column spaces of A which goes much farther.

Reference-contexts: Geometrically, this is likely to happen because at each step B k is picked to have a large volume. Another plausibility argument is due to Trefethen and Schreiber <ref> [110] </ref>. They point out that when the growth factor tends to be large, Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting tends to perform large rank one updates. Large rank one updates in turn cause more cancellation. Thus there seems to be a self-stabilizing mechanism.

Reference-contexts: Methods for computing Lyapunov exponents, which are all based on (5.1), are compared and contrasted in [50]. The literature on the related topic of estimating Lyapunov exponents from an experimental time series is even more extensive; a sampling is [1] [31] [37] [38] [39] [42] [55] [56] [91] [98] <ref> [117] </ref>. Lyapunov exponents are often used to provide numerical evidence of chaos; some examples are [49] [85] [87] [89] [105] [119].

Reference-contexts: Attempts to understand the numerical properties of Gaussian elimination go back to von Neumann, Turing, and Wilkinson. Some examples for which Gaussian elimination is unstable are given in [46] <ref> [118] </ref>. 81 Partial pivoting ensures that the subdiagonal entries of L are smaller than 1 in magnitude. But smallness of subdiagonal entries is an insufficient explanation by itself.

There has also been an effort to define and work with finite-time, local Lyapunov exponents [1] [2] [3]. Accurate computation of Lyapunov exponents has received attention in the literature, but the effect of numerical discretization of continuous dynamical systems on their Lyapunov exponents has not been studied.
