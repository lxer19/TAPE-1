Abstract: Multimedia repositories, libraries, and databases offer the potential for providing students with access to a wide variety of interconnected information resources. However, in order to realize this potential, multimedia systems should provide access to information and activities that support effective knowledge construction and learning by students. This article proposes a theoretical framework for organizing information and activities in educational hypermedia systems. We show that such systems should not be characterized primarily in terms of the kinds of physical media types that can be accessed; instead, the important aspect is the content that can be represented within a physical media, rather than the physical media itself. We propose a theory of "cognitive media types" based on the inferential and learning processes of human users. The theory highlights specific media characteristics that facilitate specific problem solving actions, which in turn are enabled by specific kinds of physical media. We present an implemented computer system, called AlgoNet, that supports hypermedia information access and constructive learning activities for self-paced learning in computer and engineering disciplines. Extensive empirical evaluations with undergraduate students suggest that self-paced interactive learning environments, coupled with multimedia information access and constructive activities organized into cognitive media types, can support and help students develop deep intuitions about important concepts in a given domain.

Reference-contexts: Zooming in and adaptation are specific problem solving actions that are facilitated by different media characteristics; these characteristics, in turn, are enabled by specific physical media. 6 To take another example, consider Emile, a multimedia environment in which subjects learn physics by constructing physics simulations <ref> (Guzdial, 1995) </ref>. While the physical media characteristics|animations|are similar to those of many other animation-based learning environments, the crucial difference lies in the reasoning processes used by the student| here, constructive experimentation rather than passive observation.

Reference-contexts: There has been little research into how people actually use such systems, what kinds of usage improves learning and under what conditions, and what types of educational materials such systems should provide. The research that has been done reveals a cloudy, complex picture <ref> (Jonassen and Mandl, 1990) </ref>. A cursory review of the research literature reveals several approaches to the problem in which access and structure of a hypermedia system is determined by various "physical" properties of the information contained in the system.

Reference-contexts: For example, zooming is a particular problem solving action|more precisely, a particular schema for a problem solving action which results in certain inferences|whereas at the higher level one might have schemas for problem solving strategies as a whole. So, for example, one may resort to case-based reasoning <ref> (Kolodner, 1993) </ref>, go back to first principles using basic definitions and equations, or reason using constructive simulations (Soloway et al., 1992). A case is a type of medium (characterized at the cognitive level) that facilitates the former problem solving strategy (case-based reasoning).

Reference-contexts: This means that the learner can choose to view text, video, sound, etc. However, research that compares learning from different media types are inconclusive in showing advantages of one physical medium over another. Research on what kinds of media types and materials facilitate learning is confusing and contradictory <ref> (Kozma, 1991) </ref>. The lack of conclusive evidence demonstrating the superiority of one physical media over another reflects the fact that many factors, above and beyond simple media, affect a student's learning process. <p> The point is that a type of physical media|here, a diagram|can affect the course of problem solving by facilitating certain kinds of inferences and making others harder. At the next level are the media characteristics <ref> (Kozma, 1991) </ref>. These are a characterization of the kinds of problem-solving actions that people might perform during a task.

Reference-contexts: These tools enable the author to create, organize, and synchronize educational information within an open and extensible architecture. Authored course modules utilize a hypermedia, networked organizational model and support the presentation of text, audio, still graphics, visualizations, and other arbitrary programs <ref> (Li et al., 1994) </ref>. Using the MMEDS authoring environment, we designed an educational module targeted for introductory computer science and engineering classes. The module allows students with minimal background to learn about basic algorithmic concepts, such as graphs and sorting. <p> Similarly, within the system, we wished to determine the most central nodes, and those that are more difficult to reach. These node attributes may affect student browsing patterns. In order to address these questions, we employed metrics that were developed for analyzing and revealing the structure of hypermedia systems <ref> (Rivlin et al., 1994) </ref>. These metrics depend of the construction of a matrix that has as its entries the shortest distance (the number of links) between every node in the system. This is called the distance matrix.

Reference-contexts: Figure 1 shows an example screen shot of the first case study. This case study uses both text and graphics to illustrate the material. The second case study illustrates 10 various graph topologies as they are instantiated in computer networks. The constructive visualizations and exercises are implemented in Polka <ref> (Stasko and Kraemer, 1993) </ref>, a software environment for developing dynamic interactive visualizations of programs that provides support for various graphical objects such as shapes and text. It also includes an interactive component so that users may directly control the visualization.

Reference-contexts: By this, we mean that the access methods in a hypermedia systems should be "cognitively relevant" to the learning and information seeking goals of the user. There have been some previous attempts to utilize "cognitively meaningful" information 3 of this kind. For example, TextNet <ref> (Trigg and Weiser, 1986) </ref> uses "link types" to link nodes in structured texts. TextNet is a text-based document composition environment that support two types of nodes: chunks and tocs.
