Reference-contexts: The other group of solutions consists in posing the problem in terms of Kalman filtering. Two different solutions have been proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>: * a steady-state Kalman filter; the estimates are computed each n milliseconds where n is a fixed duration; this solution may be seen as an heir to finite difference methods, * a time-varying Kalman filter; the estimates are updated each time an encoder pulse is received; this solution may look <p> In <ref> [1] </ref>, robot dynamics are not used and the joint motions are modeled as the outputs of independent linear filters driven by white noise. This presents the advantage of simplicity of adaptation. The method presented in this report uses the same manipulator model as in [1] but the solution proposed here consists <p> In <ref> [1] </ref>, robot dynamics are not used and the joint motions are modeled as the outputs of independent linear filters driven by white noise. This presents the advantage of simplicity of adaptation. The method presented in this report uses the same manipulator model as in [1] but the solution proposed here consists in a fusion of the two solutions mentionned above. At high velocity the algorithm considered in this project is the time-varying Kalman filter algorithm but at low velocity, a modification is introduced. <p> Conclusion is given in Section 5. Chapter 2 Description of the method 2.1 System model As mentionned in the introduction, the system model used here is simply an integrator model. The justification of a multiple-integrator signal model is given in <ref> [1] </ref>. In brief, the results come from the fact that modern robots operate at high sampling rates and as the sampling time tends to zero, the asymptotic analysis shows that the full manipulator model acts as a multiple-integrator system.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, using the Kalman filter formulation as described in section 2.2.1 is not accurate, particularly for the covariance matrix computation (the required nonnega-tivity of this matrix may be altered by computer roundoff). Bierman in <ref> [7] </ref> proposed a modified algorithm based on the U-D factorization of the covariance matrix. The complete theory is given in [7] but formulas are rewritten for completeness. The system is described by equations (2.3) and (2.4). <p> Bierman in <ref> [7] </ref> proposed a modified algorithm based on the U-D factorization of the covariance matrix.

Reference-contexts: The variance R of such a signal is 1 3 fi m With the time-varying Kalman filter algorithm, the measurement noise is now the error between the ideal and the actual quantization levels, essentially due to the imperfect alignment of the slots. An experiment done in <ref> [9] </ref> shows that the misalignment errors are Gaussian, independent random variables. The error standard deviation is * = 0:00645 deg. <p> EXPERIMENTATION 31 4.3.3 Relationship between q and the angular velocity As mentioned above, the covariance q of the white Gaussian plant noise can be viewed as a filter parameter to be adjusted.

However, no quantitative study have been done to determine a relationship between q and one of the influent parameters.
