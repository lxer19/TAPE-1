Abstract: Various methods for controlling manufacturing systems have been proposed, but until now the problem could not be considered as being solved. This may be due to the lack of a sound mathematical foundation. Therefore, an algebraic modelling method to describe manufacturing systems is developed. The result of this system modelling is a state equation which can be used for the design of closed loop feedback control systems. This paper is structured as follows: As an introduction, the need for this new modelling

Reference-contexts: Of course we have mathematical descriptions of some aspects of the manufacturing process, eg., Markov chains or queueing systems [Kleinrock 75], [Law 91], <ref> [Bolch 89] </ref>, and we can describe dependencies and the course of events of parallel processes with Petri nets [Knig 88]. However, a formal description of the manufacturing system state and a formal state equation which describes the evolution of the system state, and which is also manageable, is not known.

Reference-contexts: The algebra elements In factories where discrete manufacturing takes place, objects of various types circulates and some of them are progressively transformed and assembled into commercial end-products: raw materials, components, semifinished and finished products, fixtures, equipment, tools, ... Starting with this observation, an algebra was developed in <ref> [Canuto 93] </ref>, which lies on a pair of basic elements: a countable and finite set of (manufacturing) ob jects, a definition of manufacturing operation, and some composition rules to aggregate elementary operations and to formally briefly describe any complex network of operations designed to yield a set of end-products. <p> The fundamentals of the manufacturing algebra are described in <ref> [Canuto 93] </ref>. In the following, only the main elements are briefly recalled. To this end, R refers to the space of the real numbers, Z to the space of the integer numbers and Z l, k - to the subset of the integer numbers i,1 i k . Manufacturing objects. <p> The a -th power a = (u, y) of an operation b = (q, p) is defined as the a fold series composition of b i.e. a = b a = b b...b and t (a) = a t (b) . Basic properties of the composition are reported in <ref> [Canuto 93] </ref>. In particular parallel composition is commutative and associative, but the distributive property of the parallel composition, with respect to the series composition, does not hold. Series composition is neither commutative nor associative. Commutativity holds for a special class of manufacturing operations called mutually exclusive. <p> Product map. Given a set of objects O, a normed quantity space Q and a set of elementary operations E , equipped with their working times, a product map is defined as the set triple M = E, O, Q - . Using the graphical symbols introduced in <ref> [Canuto 93] </ref>, any product map can be given in a graphical representation showing operations and interconnection of objects as well as object quantities.

Reference-contexts: Using the graphical symbols introduced in [Canuto 93], any product map can be given in a graphical representation showing operations and interconnection of objects as well as object quantities. Within a product map M = E, O, Q - four classes of objects can be formally defined (see <ref> [Canuto 94a] </ref>): Raw objects, i.e., any object appearing only as an input object to the product map operations. The subset of raw materials in M will be indicated by R ( M ) O . <p> The subset of the reusable materials in M will be indicated with F ( M ) O. Using algebra and its normed quantity space, various optimization problems can be formulated and solved for any complex product map (see <ref> [Canuto 94a] </ref>). 3 Factory dynamics The main goal is to introduce a mathematical tool for describing the time evolution of production processes: i.e., where and when the manufacturing operations defined by the algebra are commanded and performed in order to produce the planned products at the right time and in the

Reference-contexts: State equations are the starting points for the dynamic analysis and the control design. Up to now, controllability properties, steady state solutions and a few feedback properties have been derived in <ref> [Canuto 94b] </ref>. 4 Example: Assembly line The Laboratory of Production Technology from the Institute for Tool Machines and Manufacturing Engineering (WBK), University of Karlsruhe contains an experimental plant. <p> In Tab.1, the term 4/1 (4/2) which denotes the ID of the assembly station, means that station 4 is passed for the first (second) time. Actual Production Control The plant includes a hardware actuated feedback control strategy of the push and FIFO type (see <ref> [Canuto 94b] </ref>): transport of semifinished objects (kits) between stations is actuated by a belt conveyor according to a push strategy, i.e., semifinished objects are moved and queued into the conveyors, as soon as they are available, acting as input stores of the next manufacturing unit.
