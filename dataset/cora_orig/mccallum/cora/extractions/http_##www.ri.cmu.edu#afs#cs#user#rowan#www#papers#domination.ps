Title: Graph Domination, Tabu Search and the Football Pool Problem  
Author: Rowan Davies and Gordon F. Royle 
Date: September 14, 1995  
Abstract: We describe the use of a tabu search algorithm for generating near minimum dominating sets in graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm by considering a previously studied class of graphs, the so-called "football pool" graphs, and improving many of the known upper bounds for this class.

For more on Cayley graphs, see Biggs <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 Tabu search and results Tabu search is a general purpose approximation algorithm for combinatorial optimisation based on neighbourhood search. Consider a very general problem of the following form. Minimise c (x) subject to x 2 X, with X a set of possible configurations.

Reference-contexts: Our hope is that this initial progress will stimulate further research into possibly more complicated tabu-search based implementations. In addition we generalise a construction of Blokhuis and Lam <ref> [2] </ref> and using it in conjunction with our tabu search algorithm we improve many of the bounds given by Hamalainen and Rankinen [7].

Reference-contexts: A set of vertices that exactly satisfies the sphere-packing bound is called a perfect code, and such a code dominates every vertex precisely once. The graphs F 0;b and F t;0 are usually called Hamming graphs and they contain perfect codes called Hamming codes (see for example <ref> [3] </ref>) whenever t and b take on certain values. In particular if b = 2 r 1 then F 0;b contains a perfect code of size 2 2 r r1 . Thus we have K (0; 3) = 2 and K (0; 7) = 16.

Reference-contexts: Tabu search is the name given to a relatively new class of neigh-bourhood search algorithms that often appear to outperform other heuristic approximation methods on combinatorial optimisation problems (see Glover and Laguna [6]). In Davies <ref> [4] </ref>, an investigation into a wide variety of methods for finding minimum dominating sets was conducted. <p> There are many articles describing such algorithms each of which gives experimental results to certain test problems, and the best of these algorithms have consistently solved test problems with hundreds of variables and constraints (see Davies <ref> [4] </ref> for details). In this investigation a series of graphs F t;b was used as benchmarks to compare the algorithms. <p> As with any integer linear program the main problem is finding good lower bounds for the size of the dominating set. The relaxed linear program has a fractional solution whose cost can be significantly lower than that of the optimal integer solution. Davies <ref> [4] </ref> showed that any branch-and-bound type algorithm to find a minimum dominating set for F t;0 must take at least 2 min (p;2t1) steps where p is the difference between the cost of the fractional solution and the integer solution.

Reference-contexts: The problem of finding a minimum dominating set of an arbitrary graph is NP-hard <ref> [5] </ref>. Each element of the set V = Z t 3 fi Z b 2 can be regarded as a "vector" of length t + b with t ternary coordinates and b binary coordinates, hence in F t;b two vectors are adjacent if they differ in precisely one coordinate.

Reference-contexts: Tabu search is the name given to a relatively new class of neigh-bourhood search algorithms that often appear to outperform other heuristic approximation methods on combinatorial optimisation problems (see Glover and Laguna <ref> [6] </ref>). In Davies [4], an investigation into a wide variety of methods for finding minimum dominating sets was conducted. <p> Although tabu search implementations normally rely on longer term elements to be fully effective, our study has successfully made use of just the short term aspects. Full details of these additional concepts may be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. The rationale behind tabu search in its short term form (to which we henceforth restrict our attention) is to spend as much time as possible investigating low cost configurations, while providing a mechanism to escape from local minima. <p> The 5 reason for allowing X to contain non-dominating sets is that this allows paths between small dominating sets which might otherwise need to go via a much larger dominating set. This technique is recommended by Glover and Laguna <ref> [6] </ref> for tabu search applications. It was also used in the application of simulated annealing to the football pool problem in van Laarhoven [9] as was the neighbourhood structure we used. <p> Even with careful coding ensuring that only the moves whose values change are re-evaluated this problem still renders tabu search less and less attractive as the graph size increases. One possible approach to overcome this problem is to incorporate a candidate list strategy (see <ref> [6] </ref>) to restrict the moves examined to a subset of those possible.

Reference-contexts: If b matches are so one-sided that effectively only two outcomes are considered possible, then a dominating set for F t;b guarantees at most one incorrect selection on t + b matches. Hamalainen and Rankinen <ref> [7] </ref> collated the results of many (often commercial rather than academic) publications into a listing of the smallest known dominating sets for all the graphs F t;b with t + b 13. Using this list therefore enables us to make more informed comparisons than using randomly generated test data. <p> In addition we generalise a construction of Blokhuis and Lam [2] and using it in conjunction with our tabu search algorithm we improve many of the bounds given by Hamalainen and Rankinen <ref> [7] </ref>. <p> For the graphs F m;n the tabu search directly found a dominating set of size 128 for F 4;4 improving the bound from 132. The algorithm either matched or improved the given bounds for all of the smaller (under 1000 vertices) graphs in the tables of Hamalainen and Rankinen <ref> [7] </ref>, but the other improvements were also found by Osterg-ard and Hamalainen [11]. We conclude that tabu search in the short term form we have applied is an excellent algorithm for graph domination problems on moderately sized graphs. <p> For reasons of space we separate out the results for the hypercubes F 0;b into Table 1 and the results for the "pure" football pool graphs into Table 2. Our results improved on two values given in Hamalainen and Rankinen <ref> [7] </ref> (F 0;9 and F 9;0 ) but the result for F 0;9 was independently matched by Osterg-ard and Hamalainen [11] and 9 the result for F 9;0 was improved further by Osterg-ard [12]. The improved results for F 11;0 and F 12;0 are from Osterg-ard [13]. <p> Table 3 contains the results for the remaining "mixed" graphs. Each entry consists either of 1 or 2 numbers | the top number is the value of the dominating set given in the tables of Hamalainen and Rankinen <ref> [7] </ref>, and the lower values are the currently best known bounds.

Reference-contexts: Using this list therefore enables us to make more informed comparisons than using randomly generated test data. This table has recently been updated by Osterg-ard and Hamalainen <ref> [11] </ref>. The smallest of the football pool problems for which the size of a minimum dominating set is not known is the 729-vertex graph F 6;0 . <p> The algorithm either matched or improved the given bounds for all of the smaller (under 1000 vertices) graphs in the tables of Hamalainen and Rankinen [7], but the other improvements were also found by Osterg-ard and Hamalainen <ref> [11] </ref>. We conclude that tabu search in the short term form we have applied is an excellent algorithm for graph domination problems on moderately sized graphs. However as the graph size increases, the cost per iteration increases quite rapidly if all potential moves are evalu 6 ated at each iteration. <p> Our results improved on two values given in Hamalainen and Rankinen [7] (F 0;9 and F 9;0 ) but the result for F 0;9 was independently matched by Osterg-ard and Hamalainen <ref> [11] </ref> and 9 the result for F 9;0 was improved further by Osterg-ard [12]. The improved results for F 11;0 and F 12;0 are from Osterg-ard [13]. Table 3 contains the results for the remaining "mixed" graphs. <p> Each improved value is preceded by a superscript in the range f1; 2; 3g, which has the following meaning: (1) Bound due to this paper. (2) Bound due to Osterg-ard and Hamalainen <ref> [11] </ref> duplicated independently. (3) Bound due to Osterg-ard and Hamalainen [11]. <p> Each improved value is preceded by a superscript in the range f1; 2; 3g, which has the following meaning: (1) Bound due to this paper. (2) Bound due to Osterg-ard and Hamalainen <ref> [11] </ref> duplicated independently. (3) Bound due to Osterg-ard and Hamalainen [11]. <p> It is of particular interest to note the large number of cases, mainly for the smaller values of K (t; b), for which the upper bounds found by our tabu search algorithm match those given by Osterg-ard and Hamalainen <ref> [11] </ref> which were mainly found by combinatorial construction. This provides good circumstantial evidence that the tabu search algorithm is working well for those smaller values, though the table clearly shows the performance falling away for the larger values, where it produces inferior solutions. <p> Verifying these values would be a good initial aim for further work. 7 The actual codes In this section we give explicitly the six codes for which our bounds are better than any previously known. In order to maintain consistency we use the compressed notation of Osterg-ard and Hamalainen <ref> [11] </ref>. Consider all the vectors in Z m 3 fi Z n 2 to be listed in lexicographic order. To specify the codewords we merely give the "skip-vectors" which are the number of words between consecutive codewords.

Reference-contexts: In addition we generalise a construction of Blokhuis and Lam [2] and using it in conjunction with our tabu search algorithm we improve many of the bounds given by Hamalainen and Rankinen [7]. A different, but also straightforward, implementation of tabu search by Osterg-ard <ref> [12] </ref>, performed independently of this work, has also improved some of these bounds, and further improvements continue to be made. 2 Definitions and notation In a graph G = (V; E) a vertex v 2 V is said to dominate the vertices in the closed neighbourhood N [v] = fvg [ <p> One possible approach to overcome this problem is to incorporate a candidate list strategy (see [6]) to restrict the moves examined to a subset of those possible. In his implementation of tabu search, Osterg-ard <ref> [12] </ref> successfully restricts attention to moves that involve an uncovered vertex. 4 Combinatorial construction The smallest known dominating set of F 8;0 has size 486 and was found using simulated annealing in conjunction with a combinatorial construction [van Laarhoven et al, 1988]. <p> Our results improved on two values given in Hamalainen and Rankinen [7] (F 0;9 and F 9;0 ) but the result for F 0;9 was independently matched by Osterg-ard and Hamalainen [11] and 9 the result for F 9;0 was improved further by Osterg-ard <ref> [12] </ref>. The improved results for F 11;0 and F 12;0 are from Osterg-ard [13]. Table 3 contains the results for the remaining "mixed" graphs. <p> Our implementation of tabu search is very straightforward, and as indicated throughout the text, there are several areas where further development and fine-tuning of the algorithm are indicated. In particular, some candidate list strategy should be implemented, with the results of Osterg-ard <ref> [12] </ref> giving promising results in this direction. Experimentation with longer-term strategies, intensification and diversification should also yield improvements in performance. We believe that this problem provides an excellent test-bed for research into tabu search techniques, with the extensive tables of upper bounds providing readily available performance benchmarks.

Reference-contexts: As previously mentioned, considerable effort has been expended in finding dominating sets 2 for the graphs F t;b and in particular F t;0 for 6 t 12. Most of these efforts have involved either combinatorial constructions, heuristic search or a combination of the two (see Wille <ref> [14] </ref>, van Laarhoven et. al. [10]). Our intention in this paper is to show that a very straightforward implementation of tabu search is sufficient to generate good solutions to these problems that have already been extensively studied.
