Abstract: We prove a general "pentagonal sieve" theorem that has corollaries such as the following. First, the number of pairs of partitions of n that have no parts in common is Second, if two unlabeled rooted forests of the same number of vertices are chosen i.u.a.r., then the probability that they have no common tree is .8705. . . . Third, if f, g are two monic polynomials of the same degree over the field GF (q), then the probability that f; g are relatively prime is 1 1=q. We give explicit involutions for the pentagonal sieve theorem, generalizing earlier mappings found by Bressoud and Zeilberger. p(n) 2 p(n 1) 2 p(n 2) 2 + p(n 5) 2 + p(n 7) 2 : : : :

Reference-contexts: Euler's identity for p (n), n 1, X j even p (n a (j)) = j odd where the a (j) = (3j 2 + j)=2 are the pentagonal numbers, and j ranges over all integers, was proved in <ref> [2] </ref> by exhibiting a bijection between the sets S o = S S j even P (n a (j)) for n &gt; 0. The bijection can be interpreted as a parity-changing involution 1 on S e [ S o , where when n = 0, 1 () = .

Reference-contexts: Then m is defined by m ((; fi)) = m ((ff 0 ; fi)) = (fl 0 ; ffi); where (fl; ffi) = 1 ((ff; fi)), thus establishing (4). Some examples follow. * The involution of <ref> [5] </ref> for the inclusion-exclusion principle, adapted for (5) gives the following involution, m , to prove (2). Let (; fi) 2 F (n k) m fi F (k).
