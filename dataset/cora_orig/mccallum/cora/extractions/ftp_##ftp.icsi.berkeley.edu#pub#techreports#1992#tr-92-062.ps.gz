Abstract: This thesis describes a connectionist model which learns to perceive spatial events and relations in simple movies of 2-dimensional objects, so as to name the events and relations as a speaker of a particular natural language would. Thus, the model learns perceptually grounded semantics for natural language spatial terms. Natural languages differ sometimes dramatically in the ways in which they structure space. The aim here has been to have the model be able to perform this learning task for terms from any natural language, and to have learning take place in the absence of explicit negative evidence, in order to rule out ad hoc solutions and to approximate the conditions under which children learn. The central focus of this thesis is a connectionist system which has succeeded in learning spatial terms from a number of different languages. The design and construction of this system have resulted in several technical contributions. The first is a very simple but effective means of learning without explicit negative evidence, taking positive instances of other concepts as implicit negative instances of the concept being learned, and deliberately weakening the evidence from these implicit negatives so as to reduce the effect of false implicit negatives in cases where concepts overlap. This method is shown to be effective even in situations involving a high degree of overlap among concepts. In addition, this thesis presents the notion of partially-structured connectionism, a marriage of structured and unstructured network design techniques

This might be used in place of the mechanism used here. This computation is the only pre-processing computation which is performed by a connectionist network.

Reference-contexts: The notion of "partial inclusion" is significant in Bengali: there are separate lexemes denoting complete and partial inclusion of a trajector in a landmark. This is illustrated in at least somewhat inside the landmark, while the term bhethoray is reserved for those situations in which the inclusion is complete <ref> [Ahmad, 1990] </ref>. 16 an auf TR LM 2.2.3 German Interestingly, even closely related languages can differ substantively in their spatial systems, as pointed out in [Bowerman, 1989].

Reference-contexts: Many connectionist learning systems are structured to one degree or another. Examples of connectionist systems which incorporate knowledge of the target domain into their architectures are the hand-written digit recognizers of [LeCun, 1989; Keeler et al., 1991], the equilateral triangle recognizer of <ref> [Ahmad and Omohundro, 1990] </ref>, the parser of [Jain et al., 1992], the object segmentation and recognition systems of [Mozer et al., 1991; Hummel and Biederman, 1990; Poggio and Edelman, 1990], and the perceptually-grounded lexical semantics acquisition systems of [Nenov, 1991; Nenov and Dyer, 1988; Regier, 1991b; Regier, 1991c].

Reference-contexts: The systems of [Sopena, 1988], <ref> [Allen, 1990] </ref>, and [Bartell and Cottrell, 1991] represent efforts in this direction, accepting much simplified perceptual input, and learning to associate it with natural language descriptions of that input.

Reference-contexts: This process of coercion corresponds to part of Herskovits' proposed theory of the interpretation of locative expressions. As we shall see below, others have also picked up on this notion, including myself. <ref> [Andre et al., 1986; Schirra et al., 1987] </ref> present the Citytour system, produced by the Vitra project at the University of the Saarland in Germany. This system outputs German descriptions of the motions and positions of such objects as cars, churches, 184 and post offices relative to one another. <p> In both cases the system handles moving trajectors, and is able to recognize situations and events corresponding to a number of German prepositions and verbs. <ref> [Andre et al., 1986] </ref> describes in some detail algorithms which detect the applicability of particular prepositions. The usages covered include deictically anchored uses such as hinter dem Rathaus von hier aus (in English, behind the town hall from here).

Reference-contexts: This builds on the earlier work of <ref> [Badler, 1975] </ref>, which outlined a general framework for the production of natural language descriptions of movies of moving objects. In addition, other work [Waltz, 1981; Yuhan, 1991] has focused on the use of spatial language, but in the absence of visual grounding for semantics.

Reference-contexts: This emphasis on the final frame is a central defining feature of the system presented here, and it is worthwhile to note that there is some motivation for giving the final frame a privileged status, and that there are also interesting consequences of doing so. <ref> [Behrend, 1989] </ref> presents evidence that children and adults, when learning novel verbs, tend to consider the result of the verb the most important component of the verb's meaning. In the domain of motion, this would correspond to a focus on the endpoint of motion.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, there are a number of prepositions for which no such obvious abstraction over the various senses exists. For example, <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref> presents a semantic analysis of the English preposition over, detailing literally dozens of different senses. These do not lend themselves to the straightforward sort of analysis we offered for in. <p> See x7.2.4 for further discussion of implicit paths. 29 more detailed analysis is required, pointing out the various senses and their relations with one another, along the lines of <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref>. Polysemy is widespread throughout the lexicon. More to the point, it occurs even in the highly simplified visual domain we are studying here, which indicates that it is an issue that we will have to address. <p> The ten English spatial terms are above, below, left, right, around, in, on, out of, through, and over. (Note that the English preposition over is highly polysemous <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref>. For the time being we are considering only the sense of over which denotes motion over and across the landmark. Further study of the other senses is discussed in x7.1.1.) is the same as the architectures used above, except that there are ten output nodes instead of two. <p> Note that there is no corresponding pair of senses for go over, which can only mean motion from one side of the landmark to the other, while passing through the region above it. The polysemy of over has been studied in detail <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref>, and appears to be exceedingly complex. For our purposes here in this preliminary study, it suffices to note that there is no obvious abstraction that covers all the senses of over without also including examples that we would not consider over. <p> This phenomenon is referred to as end-point focus <ref> [Brugman, 1981; Lakoff, 1987] </ref>, since the trajector is located at the end-point of an implicit search path. Another example which seems to involve an implicit search path, although not through end-point focus, is His office is along the corridor, or alternatively His office is along here somewhere. <p> Her earlier work [Harris, 1989] was a connectionist approach to Claudia Brugman's analysis of the polysemy of the English preposition over <ref> [Brugman, 1981] </ref>. Like Munro et al, Harris uses feature vectors, including such perceptually-motivated features as above, contact, proximity, motion, and support. Unlike Munro, she also includes motion features, and more abstract features such as authority, which are needed to capture some of the metaphorical uses of the prepositions she studies.

This provides some motivation for the trajector and landmark boundary and interior maps used in the system here. It is worth noting, however, that there are some fundamental differences between the maps found in the model and those in the brain.

Reference-contexts: Since learning under back-propagation tends to be more successful in shallow networks, this is an advantage that time-delay neural networks have over back-propagation through time. 3.4.3 Back-Propagation with State Units A popular approach to connectionist sequence learning is the use of state units <ref> [Elman, 1988; Jordan, 1986] </ref>. This is perhaps best exemplified by the work of Elman; the network architecture suggested in [Elman, 1988] is presented in Figure 3.7. In this figure, each box represents a layer of units. Thus, this is a standard 2-layer perceptron, with one addition, namely, the state units. <p> This is perhaps best exemplified by the work of Elman; the network architecture suggested in <ref> [Elman, 1988] </ref> is presented in Figure 3.7.

Reference-contexts: Having now covered the architecture itself in detail, and neuroscientific motivations for it briefly, we can move on to consider the system's performance. 5.4 Results The system was trained under quickprop <ref> [Fahlman, 1988] </ref>, a variant of back-propagation which exhibits fast convergence. The spatial terms were learned one at a time, using the architecture shown in Figure 5.10. <p> That movie in the training set was never learned correctly either. In addition, notice that movie number 7 here, a 20-frame 8 The system was trained under "ordinary" back-propagation, rather than a second-order method such as quickprop <ref> [Fahlman, 1988] </ref>, because training in this fashion, without back-propagation through time or some other means of arriving at the true gradient, yields only an approximation to the gradient. Thus, a relatively "cautious" learning algorithm is called for.

Reference-contexts: This characterization is clearly not correct, since it is unaffected by physical context. A more satisfying approach can be motivated by some recent work in perceptual psychology. <ref> [Freyd et al., 1988] </ref> present intriguing evidence that humans viewing static scenes (such as the ones in Figure 2.4) mentally represent the forces that are acting on the objects, keeping them where they are. <p> For instance, viewing a potted plant sitting on a table, a subject would mentally represent the force dynamics of the support relationship between table and pot, explicitly including some representation of the fact that if the table were not there, the pot would fall. In the words of <ref> [Freyd et al., 1988] </ref>, "subjects represent the underlying dynamics of coherent static scenes, so that when the forces are suddenly unbalanced, the mental representation includes an unfreezing of the potential motion implicit in the scene."

Reference-contexts: In a related vein, <ref> [Johnston and Slobin, 1979] </ref> point out that in a study of children learning locative terms in English, Italian, Serbo-Croatian, and Turkish, terms were learned more quickly when there was little or no synonymy among terms.

Reference-contexts: Since learning under back-propagation tends to be more successful in shallow networks, this is an advantage that time-delay neural networks have over back-propagation through time. 3.4.3 Back-Propagation with State Units A popular approach to connectionist sequence learning is the use of state units <ref> [Elman, 1988; Jordan, 1986] </ref>. This is perhaps best exemplified by the work of Elman; the network architecture suggested in [Elman, 1988] is presented in Figure 3.7. In this figure, each box represents a layer of units. Thus, this is a standard 2-layer perceptron, with one addition, namely, the state units.

Reference-contexts: These are contours which are perceived by human observers of particular visual stimuli, but which do not correspond to physical luminance or color discontinuities in the image (see <ref> [Kanizsa, 1979] </ref> for a review of this phenomenon). So the results of von der Heydt et al are striking because they point out that there are cells in visual cortex which respond to orientations which are not physically there in the image.

Reference-contexts: Before moving on to present the details of this architecture, however, it is worthwhile noting briefly that there is also a non-linguistic source of motivation for the conceptual decomposition of motion events into source, path, and destination: this is the visual phenomenon of apparent motion <ref> [Kolers, 1972] </ref>. Human subjects, when presented with an object displayed briefly at one position in the visual field, and then with another copy of the object displayed at another position, often perceive the object moving smoothly from the first point to the second.

These receptive fields consist of opposing centers and surrounds, such that an excitatory center is paired with an inhibitory surround, and vice versa.

Reference-contexts: In addition, as mentioned in Chapter 1, space (along with time) has a privileged position as a fundamental conceptual structuring device in language, while most other domains, color included, do not. <ref> [Lakoff, 1987] </ref> points out that [m]any scholars believe that some parts of a conceptual system are more fundamental than others. Concepts like space and time are usually taken as the most fundamental. Concepts like chutzpah in Yiddish or agape in Ancient Greek are taken as more superficial. <p> So, though it is clear that it makes sense to use a given preposition in some situation, it would often also make sense to use another. Only convention justifies the correct choice. (Emphasis added). This is similar in spirit to the viewpoint, voiced by <ref> [Lakoff, 1987] </ref>, that it is unhelpful to view the relation between the "core" or central sense of a word to other senses as either, on the one hand, entirely predictable, or, on the other hand, entirely arbitrary. <p> movie dealt with in this thesis contains a single trajector, either moving or statically located relative to a single landmark object. 2.4.3 Prototype Effects in Categorization Eleanor Rosch's work on the phenomenon of prototypicality in categorization [Rosch, 1973; Rosch, 1977; Rosch, 1978] has attracted the attention of several cognitive linguists <ref> [Lakoff, 1987; Langacker, 1987] </ref>. The attraction which prototype-based categorization has held can be seen as stemming from an awareness of serious problems encountered with the idea of defining natural language categories by lists of necessary and sufficient conditions for membership. <p> We now focus on the motivation for the built-in structures, just what it is about the movie that they capture, and how they do it. The central motivation for the design is borrowed from cognitive linguistics. <ref> [Lakoff, 1987] </ref> notes that linguistically, events are often structured in terms of three components: a source, or point of origin for motion, a path, or trajectory traced through space by the motion, and a destination, the endpoint of motion. <p> This phenomenon is referred to as end-point focus <ref> [Brugman, 1981; Lakoff, 1987] </ref>, since the trajector is located at the end-point of an implicit search path. Another example which seems to involve an implicit search path, although not through end-point focus, is His office is along the corridor, or alternatively His office is along here somewhere.

Reference-contexts: On a more specific level, the purpose is to present a number of issues that cognitive linguists have concerned themselves with, and which are dealt with in this thesis, mostly as extensions to the central architecture, in Chapter 7. 2.4.1 An Overview <ref> [Langacker, 1987] </ref>, in introducing the field of cognitive linguistics, begins by stating that [l]anguage is an integral part of human cognition. <p> movie dealt with in this thesis contains a single trajector, either moving or statically located relative to a single landmark object. 2.4.3 Prototype Effects in Categorization Eleanor Rosch's work on the phenomenon of prototypicality in categorization [Rosch, 1973; Rosch, 1977; Rosch, 1978] has attracted the attention of several cognitive linguists <ref> [Lakoff, 1987; Langacker, 1987] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: this approach holds that it is unrealistic to expect unstructured networks to be able to be able to handle large, complex problems in inherently structured domains, such as language and vision, and that a more promising route is the incorporation into the network architecture of knowledge regarding the target domain. <ref> [LeCun, 1989] </ref> notes that such incorporation of prior knowledge will tend to lead to superior generalization from the training set: Considering [back-propagation] as a general learning rule that can be used as a black box for a wide variety of problems is, of course, wishful thinking. <p> The motivation and design of these structures is the central focus of Chapter 5 and Chapter 6. Many connectionist learning systems are structured to one degree or another. Examples of connectionist systems which incorporate knowledge of the target domain into their architectures are the hand-written digit recognizers of <ref> [LeCun, 1989; Keeler et al., 1991] </ref>, the equilateral triangle recognizer of [Ahmad and Omohundro, 1990], the parser of [Jain et al., 1992], the object segmentation and recognition systems of [Mozer et al., 1991; Hummel and Biederman, 1990; Poggio and Edelman, 1990], and the perceptually-grounded lexical semantics acquisition systems of [Nenov, 1991; <p> This constraint is easily enforced using the technique of weight-sharing <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986; LeCun, 1989] </ref>. Back-propagation through time has the disadvantage that it consumes a good deal of memory by replicating network nodes. Furthermore, the resulting "unfolded" networks can be quite deep 5 , particularly for long sequences. <p> This yields a very simple center-surround receptive field. * The weights of corresponding links at all different positions are constrained to be identical (see <ref> [LeCun, 1989] </ref> for details on this technique of weight-sharing).

Reference-contexts: In contrast, much prior work in structured connectionism has focused either on non-learning systems <ref> [Cooper, 1989; Olson, 1989; Weber, 1989a; Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1990] </ref>, or on systems in which the structures were composed of essentially the same sort of units as the rest of the network [Hinton, 1986; Fanty, 1988; Harris, 1991]. <p> In the terms we are using here, given the source and then the destination, the subjects perceptually infer the path. Thus, source and destination serve as anchor-points of sorts, from which the path is computed. Connectionist research in modeling this phenomenon <ref> [Olson, 1989] </ref> has focused on the computation of explicit trajectories given starting and ending points. Returning now to the architecture at hand, it is easy to see how one might represent the elements of source and destination.

Reference-contexts: Tailoring the network architecture to the task can be thought of as a way of reducing the size of the space of possible functions that the network can generate, without overly reducing its computational power. Theoretical studies <ref> [Denker et al., 1987; Patarnello and Carnevali, 1987] </ref> have shown that the likelihood of correct generalization depends on the size of the hypothesis space (total number of networks 3 being considered), the size of the solution space (set of networks that give good generalization), and the number of training examples.

Reference-contexts: In fact, there exists a wide array of methods; the interested reader may find reviews in <ref> [Hertz et al., 1991; Pearlmutter, 1990] </ref>. Nonetheless, these are three of the most commonly used connectionist approaches to sequence learning.

Reference-contexts: Another drawback, as we mentioned earlier in Chapter 3, is the fact that tall networks with tied weights between layers, such as would result when trying to learn long sequences, tend to be difficult to train <ref> [Mozer, 1988; Pollack, 1990a] </ref>. This is a point against the method of back propagation through time in general. Since we assume here that movies may be of arbitrary length, this is potentially a serious problem with this method.

Reference-contexts: We proceed now to consider first the technical, and then the scientific, contributions made by the work described here. 1.3 Technical Contributions The system whose design and construction form the central focus of this thesis is a connectionist network, trained under error back propagation <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986] </ref>. 2 The architecture and training regimen associated with this system feature a number of novel techniques, which are potentially of general use across a wide range of applications. <p> For a full exposition, see <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986] </ref>. When being trained under back-propagation, a network takes an input vector as input, and produces an output vector at the output node (s). <p> Since this is a recurrent network, it cannot be trained using a straightforward application of the back-propagation algorithm, which assumes a feed-forward architecture. Given this, one approach to training such a network to recognize sequences is to "unfold the network over time" <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986] </ref>, as shown in Figure 3.5. Here, the recurrent network of Figure 3.4 has been transformed into a feed-forward network of depth t + 1, where t + 1 is the length of the input sequence, by replicating node a once for each step in the sequence. <p> This constraint is easily enforced using the technique of weight-sharing <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986; LeCun, 1989] </ref>. Back-propagation through time has the disadvantage that it consumes a good deal of memory by replicating network nodes. Furthermore, the resulting "unfolded" networks can be quite deep 5 , particularly for long sequences. <p> into the frame analyzer, and in order for this error signal to have much of an effect, the weights that link the frame analyzer to the hidden layer above it will need to be substantial, since the formula for computing the error signal involves a multiplication by these weights (see <ref> [Rumelhart et al., 1986] </ref>). But if this is the case, it means that during the forward pass, the contents of the Current buffer of the frame analyzer will in turn have an effect on the representation formed in the hidden layer above it.

Reference-contexts: This process of coercion corresponds to part of Herskovits' proposed theory of the interpretation of locative expressions. As we shall see below, others have also picked up on this notion, including myself. <ref> [Andre et al., 1986; Schirra et al., 1987] </ref> present the Citytour system, produced by the Vitra project at the University of the Saarland in Germany. This system outputs German descriptions of the motions and positions of such objects as cars, churches, 184 and post offices relative to one another.

Reference-contexts: As we have seen, the system presented in this thesis does exhibit graded responses of the sort that might be expressed using the above expressions. Another Vitra system, named Soccer <ref> [Schirra, 1990] </ref>, which describes a soccer match viewed from above, remedies this situation by introducing so-called "probability clouds" relative to a landmark object. These indicate the degree of applicability of a particular preposition for a trajector located at some position relative to the landmark.

Reference-contexts: This "filling-in" operation is accomplished using a simple spreading mechanism, similar to the basic operation of spreading activation proposed in Shimon Ullman's work on visual routines [Ullman, 1984]. 7 There are of course other means to accomplish this task; for example, <ref> [Sejnowski and Hinton, 1987] </ref> present a model based on the Boltzmann machine [Ackley et al., 1987] which performs a similar operation. This might be used in place of the mechanism used here. This computation is the only pre-processing computation which is performed by a connectionist network.

Reference-contexts: The systems of <ref> [Sopena, 1988] </ref>, [Allen, 1990], and [Bartell and Cottrell, 1991] represent efforts in this direction, accepting much simplified perceptual input, and learning to associate it with natural language descriptions of that input.

Reference-contexts: If the supporting surface is roughly horizontal, as in the scene on the left in Figure 2.3, the preposition auf is used to describe the relation. However, if the supporting surface is roughly vertical, as in the scene on the right, the preposition an is used instead <ref> [Stolcke, 1990a] </ref>. 2.2.4 Others An exhaustive cataloging of cross-linguistic variations in spatial systems is well beyond the scope of this thesis, and indeed probably beyond the scope of any single thesis. Nonetheless, there are a number of additional phenomena from other languages which deserve mention.

Reference-contexts: This attempt, based on a combination of Sutton's method of temporal differences <ref> [Sutton, 1988] </ref> and standard back propagation, was not successful. 186 8.1.2 Related Learning Systems A number of researchers have addressed the issue of learning to associate linguistic forms with perceptally grounded semantics, and thus have focused on problems much like those presented in this thesis.

Some of these are listed below. * Atsugewi: <ref> [Talmy, 1983] </ref> presents a set of verbal suffixes from Atsugewi, a Cal-ifornia Indian language. The suffixes presented mark distinctions which are much finer than those made by English prepositions. <p> Other salient entities in a relational predication are referred to as landmarks (lm), so called because they are naturally viewed (in prototypical instances) as providing points of reference for locating the trajector. These characterizations are are essentially the same as the concepts of figure and ground described in <ref> [Talmy, 1983] </ref>, such that figure corresponds to trajector, and ground corresponds to landmark.

Reference-contexts: that have not been handled yet (as in the sentence "The circle is over the square from here"); with the addition of a deictic center to the system, this sense could perhaps be learned along with the other senses that the system is already able to learn. 7.1.3 Force Dynamics <ref> [Talmy, 1987] </ref> has focused attention on the "force dynamic" component of semantics: how entities interact with respect to force, noting that concepts such as exertion of force, resistance to force and the like are pervasive across a number of semantic domains, both physical and non-physical.

Reference-contexts: In addition, <ref> [Tomasello, 1987] </ref> presents psycholinguistic data in which English prepositions which are members of antonym pairs (e.g. in, out, over, under) are learned earlier than other prepositions which are not (e.g. by, at).

Reference-contexts: This "filling-in" operation is accomplished using a simple spreading mechanism, similar to the basic operation of spreading activation proposed in Shimon Ullman's work on visual routines <ref> [Ullman, 1984] </ref>. 7 There are of course other means to accomplish this task; for example, [Sejnowski and Hinton, 1987] present a model based on the Boltzmann machine [Ackley et al., 1987] which performs a similar operation. This might be used in place of the mechanism used here. <p> This emphasis on situated language use requires that the system be able to perceive spatial relations among the objects in the video game world, and this is accomplished through a set of "visual operators", based on Shimon Ullman's work on visual routines <ref> [Ullman, 1984] </ref>. An example of such an operator is the flood-fill operation which was presented in Chapter 5, and which is used in my system for determining the interiors of obects.

Variation of this sort appears in the spatial domain, as even a cursory glance at systems of spatial concepts from a variety of languages will reveal.
