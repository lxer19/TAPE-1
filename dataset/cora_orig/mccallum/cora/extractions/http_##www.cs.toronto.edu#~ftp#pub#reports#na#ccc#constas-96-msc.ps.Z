Reference: [Arc73] <author> D. A. Archer. </author> <title> Some Collocation Methods for Differential Equations. </title> <type> PhD thesis, </type> <institution> Rice University, Houston, TX, U.S.A., </institution> <year> 1973. </year>
Reference-contexts: Their standard formulation leads to sub-optimal methods, in the sense that the order of convergence of the spline collocation approximation is lower than that of the interpolant in the same approximation space. Optimal collocation methods based on smooth splines have been developed and analysed by <ref> [Arc73] </ref>, [DaSw75], [Fyf68], [HCR88], [Iro87], and [PaSo87] for one-dimensional Boundary Value Problems (BVPs) and uniform discretisations. For two-dimensional BVPs defined in rectangular domains, and for uniform discretisations, [Chr88], [Chr94], [HVR88], and [Iro87] derived optimal collocation methods based on tensor products 1 2 of smooth splines.

Reference-contexts: The rate of convergence is shown to be independent of mesh size for smooth coefficients. The analysis is carried out for Dirichlet boundary conditions. It is claimed though that, with some modifications, it can be extended to other types of boundary conditions. Bank <ref> [Ban77] </ref> follows a similar approach, by choosing the preconditioner to be the matrix arising from the discretisation of a separable problem, for which the eigenvalues possess certain properties. The separable problem is solved by an alternating direction iterative procedure.

Reference-contexts: The discretisation method considered is standard centered differences. It is shown that, if the preconditioner is the symmetric part of the matrix to be solved, the convergence rate is independent of the mesh size. Numerical experiments indicate that non-symmetric preconditioners behave similarly. Bialecki et al. <ref> [BFB92] </ref> developed FFT based solvers for the Hermite bicu-bic spline collocation equations arising from Poisson's equation. Applications of these solvers to one-step preconditioned iterative methods for the solution of more general elliptic PDEs are discussed in [Bia94].

Reference-contexts: Numerical experiments indicate that non-symmetric preconditioners behave similarly. Bialecki et al. [BFB92] developed FFT based solvers for the Hermite bicu-bic spline collocation equations arising from Poisson's equation. Applications of these solvers to one-step preconditioned iterative methods for the solution of more general elliptic PDEs are discussed in <ref> [Bia94] </ref>. It is shown that the orthogonal spline collocation operator corresponding to a self-adjoint elliptic PDE with homogeneous Dirich-let boundary conditions is spectrally equivalent to the orthogonal spline collocation Laplace operator. <p> The kth iteration of the precondi tioned damped Richardson (RICH) method with damping factor t and preconditioner P is described by the relations r (k) = g Ax (k) (3.10) where x (k) and r (k) are the solution and residual vectors at the k-th iteration respectively. Bialecki <ref> [Bia94] </ref> studies Laplace preconditioned RICH methods for the solution of self-adjoint elliptic BVPs with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, discre-tised by Hermite cubic spline collocation. The damping factor t depends on the coefficients of the PDE operator. <p> It is worth noting that MRES is an one-step method and requires less storage per iteration than GMRES. With respect to efficiency, the RICH method with the damping factor chosen as suggested in <ref> [Bia94] </ref> is comparable to BiCGStab for the preconditioner H. Among the four types of preconditioners considered, for this problem, the H preconditioner outperforms the rest. This was not generally the case for other 35 problems tested, as will be shown later in this chapter. <p> Consider now Problem 4 of the Appendix. This problem is a modification of the problem used in <ref> [Bia94] </ref>. We have added non-zero coefficients for u x and u y . The ranges of the u xx , u yy , u x and u y coefficients are roughly (1, 2.7), (1, 1.8), (3.9e-3, 2.7) and (3.9e-3, 2.7), respectively.

Both formulations are equivalent with respect to convergence properties, but the deferred-correction methods are more efficient with respect to time and memory requirements [HRCV88], <ref> [Chr88] </ref>, because they give rise to a linear system having a smaller bandwidth, with fewer nonzero entries per row than the extrapolated methods.

For all computations we have used double precision. <p> The boundary conditions considered are homogeneous Dirichlet, periodic, homogeneous Neumann and any combination of these. Based on the analytic forms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the QSC matrix as described in <ref> [Chr94] </ref>, we develop FFT solvers for the QSC equations arising from the discretisation of PDEs with constant coefficients and even order derivatives. The performance of the FFT solvers on the QSC equations is almost optimal.

Reference-contexts: It is shown that the orthogonal spline collocation operator corresponding to a self-adjoint elliptic PDE with homogeneous Dirich-let boundary conditions is spectrally equivalent to the orthogonal spline collocation Laplace operator. Greenbaum <ref> [Gre92] </ref> studies the condition number of preconditioned matrices arising from the discretisation of self-adjoint PDE operators with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions by finite element or finite difference methods. The matrices arising from the discretisation are assumed to be symmetric positive definite. The preconditioners are symmetric diagonal scalings of the Laplacian. <p> We refer to this type of preconditioner as Helmholtz (H) preconditioner. Greenbaum <ref> [Gre92] </ref> studies preconditioners of the form P = SLS, for any positive definite diagonal matrix S. <p> In the case of the spline collocation discretisation method, 29 though, the resulting matrix A for the class of problems considered in <ref> [Gre92] </ref> is not necessarily symmetric positive definite. Moreover, in this thesis, we deal with a broader class of problems, which are not necessarily self-adjoint and include several types of boundary conditions. Therefore, we study preconditioners of three forms: a) P = DH D, c) P = HD.

Reference-contexts: The solvers considered are based on Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) and are suitable for parallel computation.

Reference-contexts: For the implementation of the FFT, iFFT, FST-II and iFST-II a package developed at the NEC Systems Laboratory was used <ref> [Mos92] </ref>. The routines of the package implement the Stockham algorithm, using only real operations and omitting any redundant operations with zero imaginary parts. The package provides an option 23 for multiple FFTs, such as those required for Steps 1, 2, 4 and 5 of the previous subsection. <p> For the implementation of the FFT, iFFT, FST-II, iFST-II, FCT-II and iFCT-II the same package <ref> [Mos92] </ref> was used as for the two-dimensional problems. The results shown in Table 4.1, correspond to Problem 6 of the Appendix. The error and convergence results are presented in order to verify that the performance of the QSC method on three-dimensional problems is similar to that for two-dimensional ones. <p> A difficulty arises, though, in the case of two- and three-dimensional problems. The transposition of matrices required, for example, between Steps 1 and 2 of Section 2.2 is not straighforward parallelisable and the technique used with the FFT package <ref> [Mos92] </ref> is not applicable in a distributed memory environment. Therefore, an interesting future problem is to test the performance of the FFT solvers on various parallel machines and to develop methods to overcome the transposition problem on specific interconnection networks among processors.

Reference-contexts: The damping factor t depends on the coefficients of the PDE operator. Bialecki gives a simple relation that approximates the optimal damping factor. 30 In the same paper, Bialecki studies Laplace preconditioned Minimum Residual (MRES) methods arising from applying the Minimum Residual method <ref> [EES83] </ref> to the preconditioned linear system ^ A^x = ^g (3.12) where ^ A = P 1=2 AP 1=2 , ^x = P 1=2 x and ^g = P 1=2 g.

Reference-contexts: In order to accelerate convergence, one could use a multi-step method for non-symmetric systems, for example, GMRES <ref> [SaSc86] </ref> or BiCGStab [vdV92]. In our study, we have considered several such methods. 3.3 Numerical results. We present numerical results that demonstrate the convergence and overall performance of the Fourier preconditioned iterative solvers discussed in Section 3.2. The preconditioners considered are those discussed in Section 3.1.
