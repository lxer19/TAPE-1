Abstract: The fabrication process begins with an n-type silicon wafer (r = 10 W-cm) which will be used as the ground plane. Although not done in this process, we could have, at this point, formed heavily-doped regions on the surface of the wafer to act as clamping counter electrodes. A 2.0 mm-thick layer of LPCVD silicon-rich, low-stress silicon nitride is deposited on the wafer surface to form the insulating layer. The clamping voltage can be reduced by thinning the nitride layer, with the limit that it must be thick enough to survive the prolonged hydrouoric acid (HF) release etch which slowly attacks silicon nitride. A 2.0 mm-thick layer of LPCVD PSG is deposited to form the sacrificial layer. The first photolithography step defines holes through the PSG layer which will serve as insulated anchor positions for the micro-actuator. After stripping the first photoresist mask, a second lithography step defines holes through both the PSG and the silicon nitride layer so that electrical contact can be made to the substrate. After stripping the resist, a brief etch in HF is used to remove any native oxide and a 2.0 mm-thick layer of LPCVD polysilicon (605 C) is deposited to be used as the structural layer. After a 0.5 mm-thick layer of LPCVD PSG is deposited on top of the polysilicon, the wafer is annealed in nitrogen at 1000 C for one hour to dope the polysilicon layer with phosphorus from the PSG and to reduce residual stress in the polysilicon film. A third lithography step defines the top PSG layer with the pattern for the mechanical structure. After the resist is stripped, the top layer of patterned PSG acts as a mask during a reactive-ion etch that selectively etches through the polysilicon layer until it stops on the PSG sacrificial layer. The top PSG layer is then removed in a wet HF etch that also attacks the revealed sacrificial layer and undercuts the polysilicon microstruc-ture by about 0.5 mm (Fig. 6a). A 0.1 mm-thick layer of NiFe is sputter deposited to form the electroplating seed layer. Since sputtering deposits material in many directions, some NiFe is deposited underneath the undercut polysilicon layer (Fig. 6b). The fourth and final lithography step defines a 4.0 mm-thick resist plating mask, which must be thick enough to cover the step from the sacrificial-PSG layer to the structural-polysilicon layer (Fig. c). If the mask is too thin, spurious hemispherical electrodeposits will form where the electric field breaks down the resist, particularly at the corners of the polysilicon structure where the electric field is concentrated. The plating mask is defined 50 mm beyond the edge of the polysilicon plate on three edges (the far end and 90% of the way back along the sides toward the torsional bars). A significant overexposure is required to develop and remove the resist fully from underneath the polysilicon overhang. Nickel is next electroplated onto the exposed areas of the seed layer, covering the top, the side, and underneath the polysili-con overhang (Fig. 6d). Thus, the ferromagnetic material is formed in a shape that essentially grasps the polysilicon layer and thereby achieves a good mechanical bond, which is helpful because nickel does not adhere well to polysilicon. We have found that adhesion layers, such as chrome and titanium, do not perform satisfactorily when exposed to a prolonged HF release etch. After the resist plating mask is stripped, the excess seed layer is removed by sputter etching (Fig. 6e), and the wafer is placed in a prolonged HF etch that removes the PSG sacrificial layer (Fig. 6f) (30 minutes for the devices shown in Fig. 2). A supercritical carbon dioxide drying technique is used to prevent the microstructures from sticking to the substrate after the release step [8]. We have shown that ferromagnetic microactuators with torsional-polysilicon exures, capable of very large out-of-plane displacements (&gt; 1 mm), can be individually controlled with integrated coils or individually addressed by clamping with electrostatic forces. Individual prototype-torsional devices are shown to be deected 45 out of the plane of the wafer, by the magnetic field generated when a current of 500 mA ows through a 10-turn coil integrated around each device. Individual prototype-torsional devices, fabricated on a dielectric coated ground plane, can be electrostatically clamped in place using 5 V address potentials when an off-chip magnetic field of 10 kA/m is applied. This field torques unaddressed structures roughly into a perpendicular position. We have also shown that ferromagnetic films can be compatibly integrated with silicon-based materials and processes into a batch-fabrication process with good adhesion results using an under-etch technique to hold the films to the polysilicon layers. By accounting for the coercivity of the ferromagnetic material, the agreement of the static-deection model with experimental results is improved, particularly at low magnetic fields. A model predicting the dynamic mechanical behavior of these devices has been developed which agrees quite well with experimentally measured frequency responses. An important application area for individually controllable ferromagnetic microactuators with polycrystalline silicon torsion-bar exures is to microphotonic applications, such as optical scanners, displays, and switches. 5.
