Title: FREQUENCY-INDEPENDENT BEAMFORMING

Abstract: The beamwidth of a linear array decreases as frequency increases. For broadband beamformers such as microphone arrays for teleconferencing, this frequency dependence implies that signals incident on the outer portions of the main beam are subject to an undesirable lowpass filtering process. In this paper several ways of attaining beamwidth constancy are discussed, including a novel method based on superimposing several marginally steered beams to form a constant beamwidth multi-beam. This method provides an analytically tractable framework for designing realizable constant beamwidth beamformers.

Reference-contexts: In this paper several methods of constant beamwidth beamforming are discussed, including a new approach in which a constant beamwidth multi-beam is synthesized by superimposing several marginally steered single beams <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. This technique provides an analytical framework for a previously proposed method which has been neglected due to computational difficulties; the framework involves the design of discrete-time filters with simultaneous amplitude and phase constraints. An effective design solution is presented. 2.

Reference-contexts: If the array is shaded with Cheby-shev weights, the beamwidth is given by Chebyshev = 2 sin 1 !t 0 x 0 where the parameter x 0 implies a sidelobe threshold of 20 log 10 cos (2N arccos x 0 ) dB <ref> [2] </ref>. For increased x 0 , corresponding to a lower sidelobe level, the beamwidth is greater. Equation 3 exhibits the same basic dependencies on !, d, and N as equation 2; the !-dependence is illustrated in figure 1.

These results will be used in section 4. for M = 11, d = c=2! 0 (half-wavelength spacing at 2! 0 ), and 25 dB Chebyshev shading. Simulations in later sections use these parameter values as well. 3. CONSTANT BEAMWIDTH METHODS 3.1. <p> For an array constrained to avoid spatial aliasing, the SHA technique with C = 2 conforms to a harmonic nesting approach, wherein progressively higher frequency octaves are processed by progressively smaller arrays <ref> [3] </ref>; analogous structures are termed log-periodic in the electromagnetics literature since the array pattern is periodic in the log of frequency. The scale factor of two permits an efficient nesting of the various single-octave subarrays; some elements are shared between multiple subarrays.

Reference-contexts: The design of elemental lowpass filters has been neglected in the literature due to the apparent computational difficulty. It is shown later that these filters can be readily approximated and implemented. 3.3. Multi-Beamforming In the multi-beamforming approach proposed by Tucker <ref> [6] </ref>, a broadside beam and several marginally steered beams are simultaneously formed; the steered beams are formed symmetrically with respect to broadside at fixed steering angles.
