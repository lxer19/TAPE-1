Abstract: Fast algorithms for computing the product by a vector are presented for a number of classes of matrices whose properties relate to the properties of Toeplitz, Vandermonde or Cauchy matrices (these matrices are defined using the concept of displacement of a matrix) and also for their inverses. All the actions which are not dependent upon the coordinates of the input vector are singled out in a separate preprocessing stage. The proposed algorithms are based on new representations of these matrices, involving factor circulants.

Reference-contexts: Formula (4.15) is a generalization of the formula of G.Ammar and P.Gader <ref> [2] </ref>, where they considered the case ' = 1, = 1 and positive definite Toeplitz matrix A. This formula allows to prove the following result. Theorem 4.3 Let A = (a ij ) n1 i;j=0 be invertible Toeplitz matrix with nonzero leading minor of order n 1.

Reference-contexts: These algorithms were divided into two separate stages: first solving the equations (4.8) and second, application of the formula (4.9). Let us denote by o (n) the complexity of solving one equation of the type (4.8). According to <ref> [3] </ref> o (n) O (n log 2 n) flops. Thus the Gohberg-Semencul formula enables one to compute the product of the inverse of Toeplitz matrix by a vector in 16 OE (n) + O (n) flops after 2 o (n) + 8 OE (n) + O (n) flops preprocessing. <p> Below we show how to write down for A 1 the factor circulant decomposition on the basis of the solutions of the equations (4.8). Such a decomposition will allow to apply at the stage of preprocessing the fast algorithm of Brent, Gustavson and Yun <ref> [3] </ref>. Lemma 4.2 Let A = (a ij ) n1 i;j=0 be a Toeplitz matrix.

Reference-contexts: The remarks of the referees were important and constructive. In particular under the influence of these remarks we added the section 4.3.

Before stating the result let us introduce necessary concepts. <p> Before stating the result let us introduce necessary concepts. Let A (z) = i=0 b i z i (b 0 6= 0) be formal power series and T mn (z) = P n S mn (z) = i=0 s i z i be two polynomials. Following <ref> [4] </ref> we will refer to the rational function S mn (z) T mn (z) as scaled Pade fraction of type (m; n) for A (z) if the following three conditions hold : (i) min (m deg (S mn (z)); n deg (T mn (z))) = 0, (ii) GCD (S mn (z); <p> Let T mn (z) be a scaled Pade fraction of type (m; n) for A (z), GCD (S mn (z); T mn (z)) = z mn and put Following <ref> [4] </ref> we will refer to scaled Pade fraction S m fl n fl (z) T m fl n fl (z) of the type (m fl ; n fl ) for A (z) as the predecessor of S mn (z) T mn (z) . <p> For m; n 2 N and for formal power series A (z) denote by (m; n) the complexity of the computing for A (z) the scaled Pade fraction S mn (z) T mn (z) together with its predecessor S m fl n fl (z) According to <ref> [4] </ref> (m; n) O ((m + n) log 2 (m + n)): The referee pointed out that this result enables one to drop out in theorem 4.3 the condition of invertibility of leading submatrix of order n 1. In fact the following result is obtained. <p> Then Comp (A 1 ; b) 6 OE (n) + O (n) (4.19) and Prep (A 1 ) (n; n) + 4 OE (n) + O (n): (4.20) Proof. First of all let us show how using the Cabay-Choi algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> one can compute the solutions of the equations (4.10). Set A (z) = 1 + i=1 19 and let rational function S nn (z) T nn (z) be scaled Pade fraction of type (n,n) for A (z).

Reference-contexts: The definitions of these classes of matrices are based on the concept of displacement. Let F f and F b be matrices from C nfin . Following <ref> [6] </ref> let us refer to the matrix r fF f ;F b g (A) = A F f AF T as fF f ; F b g-displacement of the matrix A 2 C nfin . <p> The matrices with low fZ 0 ; Z 0 g-displacement rank are called close-to-Toeplitz (they are also referred to as near-to-Toeplitz, Toeplitz-like, of the Toeplitz type, etc.). The classes of close-to-Vandermonde and close-to-Cauchy matrices (the names Vandermonde-like, Cauchy like are also used) are defined (see [13] <ref> [6] </ref>) using another displacement operator 4 fF f ;F b g (A) = F f A AF b : Namely, matrix A is called close-to-Vandermonde if it is transformed by 4 fdiag (t);Z 1 ' g () in the matrix of low rank. <p> Thus, the invertibility of A is now proved. In the next subsection the above scheme will be embodied for the inverses of Toeplitz matrices. Here we show that divide-and-conquer implementation from <ref> [6] </ref> of generalized Schur algorithm is useful for computing the '-cyclic displacement of strongly regular Toeplitz-related matrices (a strongly regular matrix is, by definition, a matrix whose all leading minors are nonzero). 14 Theorem 4.1 Let strongly regular matrix A 2 C nfin be given by a '-cyclic generator and the <p> Using the algorithm from <ref> [6] </ref> compute in O (ff 3 n log 2 n) flops for matrix A 1 its fZ 0 ; Z 0 g generator of length ff + 4. 3.

Nevertheless, this approach has definite advantages. Firstly, the common form (0.1) of the displacement operator enables us to reduce the problems for Vandermonde-related and for Cauchy-related matrices to the analogous problems for Toeplitz-related matrices.
