Abstract: Vedo-Vedi consists of a visual language and software that supports editing, viewing, and sending visual messages written in the language. Its purpose is to enable 8-15 year old children to communicate visually through the Internet without their having to read or write a common textual language. Novel aspects of this system include its frame-based syntax and semantics, an underlying machine representation of the meaning of messages, facilities for translation into several textual languages, movie-like animation of messages, and support for user extensions. Vedo-Vedi works with Java 1.1 enabled browsers or as a stand-alone application on PCs connected to the Internet. This paper describes its key design features and some of the implementation issues involved in realizing them.
