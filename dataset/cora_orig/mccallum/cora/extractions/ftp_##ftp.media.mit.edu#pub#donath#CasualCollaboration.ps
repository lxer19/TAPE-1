Abstract: As computers are increasingly used to mediate social interaction, tools are needed not only to support direct communication, but also to create a richer social environment for the networked group. These include tools that provide information about the presence of others and that give the user a sense of the ongoing activities. This paper describes two ongoing research projects in this area. Collaboration-at-a-Glance is a visual interface to an electronic group. It creates an animated image of a remote meeting by compositing pictures of the participants so as to represent their actions. Visual Who is a window onto a larger community. Like a window onto a street, it shows the comings and goings of the community members. Whyte went on to describe a number of places that attract people to them: they are places in which there are other people sometimes familiar, often not. The key is the ongoing presence of others, of an environment that is vigorous and populated, one that has a constant ow of human activity. Whytes book is an argument against the design of spaces that do not draw people to them, against the bland corporate landscapes and the sterile plazas, against places that may perform their stated function efficiently, but that fail in their community role. oriented activities are less obvious and less well understood. Yet to a large extent, the future success of online communities depends on how well the tools for this activity are designed. If they are poorly designed, the online world may feel like a vast concrete corporate plaza, with a few sterile benches: a place people hurry through on their way to work or home. If the tools are well designed, the online world will not only be inhabited, but will be able to support a wide range of interactions and relationships, from close collaboration to casual people watching. Casual collaboration. Computers are increasingly used for social tasks, such as reading email and working cooperatively. For collaborative work, a variety of shared workspaces have been created, most of which emphasize task performance. Yet a social environment does not consist solely of direct communication and purposeful collaboration. Knowing who else is around, sensing the level of activity, and generally being aware of the presence of others is an important part of participating in a social milieu. Casual collaboration the chance discussion at the coffee maker, the suggestions of colleagues who happen to pass by is an essential and highly productive part of the work experience [7][3]. In a well designed work environment, these chance encounters occur frequently. They are facilitated by easy access to ones co-workers not formal meetings, but proximity and awareness of presence. The two projects described in this paper bring this awareness and the opportunity for chance encounters to people for whom proximity is sharing a network connection, rather than a physical space.

Reference-contexts: The stylized cartoons used in the current system were made by altering the photographs using a paint program. Automatic cartoon generation would be quite useful, especially for larger groups. We have been doing some work in this area, expanding the technique described in <ref> [6] </ref> to create color images. The client uses three pieces of information to synthesize a view: the 3D location of all the participants (according to that clients layout); the 3D location of the viewer; and the current state of the group who is present and where are they looking.
