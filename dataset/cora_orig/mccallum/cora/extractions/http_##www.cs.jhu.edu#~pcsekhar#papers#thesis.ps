Reference-contexts: The branches of lung tree structures are modeled as Generalized Cylinders (GC). GC representation is one of the most popular shape-description methods in computer vision today <ref> [1, 37] </ref>. A generalized cylinder is specified by its cross-section, a sweep rule, and a spine.

Reference-contexts: If this is true, then using efficient linear time tree isomorphism algorithms <ref> [2] </ref>, one can match the tree topologies of the CATs (obtained during various phases of breathing) and obtain the relative changes in physiological measurements. But in reality, the tree topologies resulting from CATs obtained during various phases of breathing are not isomorphic.

Reference-contexts: Several three-dimensional thinning algorithms [30, 36] have been tried on lung tree structures with limited success [53, 52]. Cores have been used <ref> [3, 35] </ref> as a summary descriptor of figural shape in 2-D 24 images. Cores have the properties of rotational, translational, and zoom invariance, as well as insensitivity to noise, blurring and certain changes in image intensity. <p> Pizer and his co-authors [12] state that the existing core extraction algorithms have been largely restricted to 1-D cores from 2-D images and some work has been done on extracting 1-D cores from 3-D images <ref> [3] </ref>. In the case of 3-D tree volumes, 1-D cores obtain the medialness of the tree volume. In [3], 1-D core extraction methods were applied to segment and extract medial axis of the cerebral vessels obtained from 3-D magnetic resonance angiographic images. <p> co-authors [12] state that the existing core extraction algorithms have been largely restricted to 1-D cores from 2-D images and some work has been done on extracting 1-D cores from 3-D images <ref> [3] </ref>.

In [3], 1-D core extraction methods were applied to segment and extract medial axis of the cerebral vessels obtained from 3-D magnetic resonance angiographic images.

But these methods required user interaction (105 mouse clicks) in order to obtain the segmented 3-D vascular tree and its medial axis [3]. Initial width estimates had to be provided by the user, in order to compute the actual width estimates (i.e., branch diameters) of the vessel branches. At branch bifurcation regions, the proximity of neighbor branches interferes with the medialness calculations and causes a rapid change in the local width estimates. <p> At branch bifurcation regions, the proximity of neighbor branches interferes with the medialness calculations and causes a rapid change in the local width estimates.

Cores are computationally intensive in computing the medialness of an object [3], since they directly work on 3-D grey scale images.

In addition, core-based methods obtain medialness on general 3-D objects. <p> Existing core extraction algorithms have been largely restricted to the calculation of 1-D cores from 2-D images [35].

Reference-contexts: Hence it is almost impossible to segment the PA tree using thresholding alone. This chapter deals with algorithms to automate the segmentation of pulmonary tree structures in the lung using tools from Mathematical Morphology <ref> [10, 43] </ref>. This involves segmenting three different types of three-dimensional tree structures (airway tree, pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein) from a volumetric stack of gray scale HRCT images. The idea behind mathematical morphology is to use geometric structures of different sizes and shapes, known as structuring elements to process images.

Reference-contexts: The segmentation algorithms presented in this thesis use tools from mathematical morphology in order to exploit the geometry of these tree structures. Morphological tools have been applied in biomedical applications such as the segmentation of left ventricular chambers in the heart <ref> [18] </ref>, and detection of microaneurysms in eye blood vessels [47]. The central idea behind mathematical morphology is to use geometric structures of different sizes and shapes to process images, and these are known as structuring elements.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, the resulting medial axis tree may not truly reflect the branching structure of the 3-D tree volume, and further post-processing is required to compute geometric measurements.

Thinning algorithms produce skeletons which may not reflect the true shape of the original pattern.

Prior work using the Dynamic Spatial Reconstructor, a CT scanner specifically built to acquire fast 3-D volumetric images, has shown the feasibility of dynamic analysis of pulmonary tree structures <ref> [20, 41] </ref>, but its limited resolution and poor contrast detectability constrained analysis to the major bronchi and vessels. With the advent of HRCT imaging techniques, automated methods to compute the physiological parameters of the tree structures in the lung are being developed.

Reference-contexts: Branch Length : There are various notions of measuring the branch length. But an accurate and consistent definition which works for all branches will be useful. Physical measurements of branch length were made on plastic casts of lung tree surface <ref> [22, 48] </ref>, starting from one junction point to the other, (from J 1 to J 2 for branch B1) as shown in Part (A) of Fig. 1.7. 16 Using the central axis trees [53], the branch length can be defined as the Eu-clidean distance between two successive branch points of the <p> He compared five different human lungs at the same state of inflation by making manual measurements on the casts.

Reference-contexts: Previous work involved preparing plastic casts of the tree structures and obtaining measurements from them [49, 42]. From experiments on a plastic replica of the bronchial cavity of an adult lung, Weibel obtained the average branch lengths and diameters of the bronchial tree structure [48].

Reference-contexts: One study [51] involved segmenting airways using simple thresholding techniques. Threshold based segmentation <ref> [24] </ref> is conservative in selecting the threshold, in order to avoid leaks (that occurs from intensity variations in the airway wall) to the background. Therefore, it probably underestimates the area of airway regions 20 in each image and hence the airway volume.

Reference-contexts: We obtain a sequence of solutions of decreasing objective function values. This scheme is related to a method for unconstrained minimization known as Coor 111 dinate Descent Method, which is well known in the Nonlinear Programming Literature <ref> [31] </ref>. The convergence of this method depends on how well the centroid points lie along the axis of the branch. Hence, accurate computation of centroid points is crucial at each branch bifurcation.

Reference-contexts: Hence it is almost impossible to segment the PA tree using thresholding alone. This chapter deals with algorithms to automate the segmentation of pulmonary tree structures in the lung using tools from Mathematical Morphology <ref> [10, 43] </ref>. This involves segmenting three different types of three-dimensional tree structures (airway tree, pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein) from a volumetric stack of gray scale HRCT images. The idea behind mathematical morphology is to use geometric structures of different sizes and shapes, known as structuring elements to process images. <p> In terms of the 8-bit gray level intensities, the airways correspond to low intensity regions, and the vessels along with the airway wall correspond to high intensity regions, as imaged by HRCT. 2.2 Mathematical Morphology Mathematical morphology was introduced in <ref> [43] </ref> as a tool to investigate geometric structures in images. Binary images are represented as sets in the two-dimensional Euclidean space E (in our case, E is the subset of the discrete grid Z 2 ). <p> Opening and closing can also be viewed as low-pass filters. Basic morphological operators, like dilation (X B), erosion (X B), opening (X ffi B), and closing (X * B), can be extended to the gray scale case. Formal treatments of gray scale morphology is presented in <ref> [43, 16, 17] </ref>. We provide a few definitions of gray scale morphology from [16]. 42 Let A E N , where E N is the Euclidean discrete N-space.

Physical measurements of branch length were made on plastic casts of lung tree surface <ref> [22, 48] </ref>, starting from one junction point to the other, (from J 1 to J 2 for branch B1) as shown in Part (A) of Fig. 1.7. 16 Using the central axis trees [53], the branch length can be defined as the Eu-clidean distance between two successive branch points of the <p> In 1925, Macklin [32] used projection X-rays to visualize and measure bronchial dimensions with inspiration and expiration.

He compared five different human lungs at the same state of inflation by making manual measurements on the casts. <p> He compared five different human lungs at the same state of inflation by making manual measurements on the casts.

From experiments on a plastic replica of the bronchial cavity of an adult lung, Weibel obtained the average branch lengths and diameters of the bronchial tree structure <ref> [48] </ref>.

Since bronchial trees are mostly binary in nature <ref> [48] </ref>, one need not worry about higher degrees of branching. T reflects the branching structure of the 3-D tree volume. The nodes in T correspond to branches and the edges in T correspond to adjacent branches of the 3-D tree volume. <p> We also approximate the branch axis to be the straight line joining the two adjacent 3-D branch points of the central axis tree and dilate it by tapered cylinders. This turns out to be a crude approximation of that branch.

Reference-contexts: With the advent of High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) imaging modality, one can obtain 2-D multislice images (typically around 200 images) of 3-D pulmonary tree structures in the lung and conduct a thorough 3-D geometric analysis. 1.1.1 Overview of Lung Physiology The following discussion of lung anatomy and physiology <ref> [49] </ref> is presented to illustrate the inherent complexity of lung tree structures. There are five lobes in the human lung and each lobe has an airway tree which contains air, and two types of vascular trees which contain blood. The airway tree is also called the bronchial tree (BT). <p> In the lung, the trachea branches through a system of conducting airways. The branching structure in humans has been approximated to a dichotomous system consisting of 23 generations <ref> [49] </ref>. In a dichotomous system, each branch bifurcates to two daughter branches (Fig. 1.3). If the two daughter branches have identical dimensions i.e., equal branch lengths, branch diameters, and branch off their parent branch at equal angles, then it is called regular dichotomy. <p> If the dimensions of the 6 as opposed to irregular dichotomy daughter branches are unequal, then it results in irregular dichotomy, also called asymmetric branching. Irregular dichotomy is more common in nature. These are the two models of branching proposed by Weibel <ref> [49] </ref>. The airway tree is divided into two zones : conductive zone and respiratory zone. The conductive zone transmits air from the trachea to the peripheral channels (respiratory zone), that carry alveoli in their walls. <p> The PA tree follows the airway tree branching structure, for the first 16 generations. Beyond that, the PA tree divides more frequently than the airway tree, with over 28 generations of branching instead of 23 generations for the airways <ref> [49] </ref>. The additional generations of branching is due to tiny branches that leave the PA tree at right angles, in order to supply blood to parenchymal units adjacent to the airway tree. <p> better estimates of segmented tree volumes when compared to thresholding methods in the case of airway trees, and this 22 has been verified by experts. 1.3.2 Central Axis Algorithm for 3-D Tree Volumes Bronchial tree structures have been studied extensively by the physiological community and various models have been developed <ref> [49, 42] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Physical measurements of branch length were made on plastic casts of lung tree surface [22, 48], starting from one junction point to the other, (from J 1 to J 2 for branch B1) as shown in Part (A) of Fig. 1.7. 16 Using the central axis trees <ref> [53] </ref>, the branch length can be defined as the Eu-clidean distance between two successive branch points of the two branch bifurcations. As an example, Part (A) of Fig. 1.7 shows the branch length for B1 as the distance between branch points b1 and b2. <p> Moreover, one can study quantitative changes in the same lung during inhalation and exha 19 lation. Recent work by Wood, Zerhouni, Mitzner and others involved the use of HRCT <ref> [53, 51, 52] </ref> to scan the lung and stack the image slices to create a 3-D tree volume. After segmenting the airway tree volume using simple thresholding techniques, these investigators computed the central axis tree and obtained physiological measurements. <p> With the advent of HRCT, one can study the physiological changes of the lung tree structures during various stages of inspiration and expiration. Recent work using HRCT <ref> [53, 51, 52] </ref>, involved scanning lungs and stacking the slices to create a volume of bronchial tree data. After segmenting the airway tree using simple thresholding techniques, these investigators computed the central axis tree and obtained physiological measurements. <p> In the case of lung tree structures, thinning algorithms produce connected set of voxels that flatten out at branch bifurcation regions, and lead to poor localization of the medial axis. Several three-dimensional thinning algorithms [30, 36] have been tried on lung tree structures with limited success <ref> [53, 52] </ref>. Cores have been used [3, 35] as a summary descriptor of figural shape in 2-D 24 images. Cores have the properties of rotational, translational, and zoom invariance, as well as insensitivity to noise, blurring and certain changes in image intensity. <p> Our goal is to obtain physiological measurements with no manual intervention. Our methods are specific to 3-D tree structures, are computationally faster and fully automated when compared to core-based methods. Earlier work on obtaining the central axis tree <ref> [53, 51] </ref> used 3-D seeded region growing techniques [45] to obtain the branching structure of the 3-D tree volume. The central axis algorithm proposed in this thesis uses a two-pass 3-D seeded region-growing algorithm similar to [53, 51], in order to obtain the branching structure of the 3-D tree volume. <p> Earlier work on obtaining the central axis tree <ref> [53, 51] </ref> used 3-D seeded region growing techniques [45] to obtain the branching structure of the 3-D tree volume. The central axis algorithm proposed in this thesis uses a two-pass 3-D seeded region-growing algorithm similar to [53, 51], in order to obtain the branching structure of the 3-D tree volume. This algorithm obtains centroid points that avoid branch bifurcation regions, and provides a robust mathematical formulation to compute the central axis tree at each branch bifurcation. <p> The third type of matching occurs in a clinical setting. Previous work on pulmonary tree volume matching <ref> [53] </ref> involved manual processing to compare the corresponding central axis tree representations. Instead of matching two 3-D tree volumes which would be cumbersome, the proposed algorithms match the central axis trees corresponding to these two 3-D tree volumes. <p> Previous work <ref> [51, 53] </ref> did not discuss results with respect to empirical 3-D tree model data. We have taken a model- based approach to compute accurate physiological measurements. This way, we can characterize and perform error analysis on ideal, noisy and real data sets. <p> The goal is to obtain a one-to-one matching algorithm of the nodes in T 1 to T 2 which preserves the tree topology and at the same time matches the geometric properties of the two central axis trees. Previous work on pulmonary tree volume correspondence <ref> [53] </ref> involved manual processing in order to compare their central axis tree representations. In [53], the tree volume was reduced to a CAT. Starting from the root, the edges of the CAT were appended with binary values (0 or 1) based on the cross-sectional area of the corresponding branch. <p> Previous work on pulmonary tree volume correspondence <ref> [53] </ref> involved manual processing in order to compare their central axis tree representations.

This results in a binary string sequence corresponding to each edge of the CAT. <p> This arises due to the limitations in the resolution of HRCT, or due to improper segmentation of these new branches in the smaller tree volume. Hence, the CAT correspondences were done manually <ref> [53] </ref>. There are two components associated with the matching algorithms of T 1 and 148 T 2 : (1) Topology match (2) Geometric feature match.
