Reference-contexts: Moreover, the sum of these contributions over all bound intermediate states is finite, while the sum over all unbound intermediate states diverges at most logarithmically. These results should be compared with the original calculations of Bethe <ref> [3] </ref>. Bethe's calculations use a dipole approximation neglecting retardation, and require a renormalization to make even the individual contributions finite. 1 Au and Feinberg [4], using Schwinger's exact expression for the Green's function of the non-relativistic hydrogenic atom, have also shown that the sum over all intermediate states diverges logarithmically. <p> These results improve on the original calculations of Bethe <ref> [3] </ref>, and seem consistent with more recent calculations of Au and Feinberg [4]. 18 APPENDIX Here we obtain the bounds for the integral J used in the text in Eqs.

Note that these functions are all real. The C i are normalization constants, which we take as (cf. <p> Note that these functions are all real.

In this case the final electron state is unbound, with wave number p &gt; 0, and Eq. (10) is not in closed form. In this case we make the transformation (see Erdelyi <ref> [6, page 107, #34] </ref> F (a; b; c; z) = (c a)(b) + (c b)(a) This gives z j+1 F (j + 1 + i=p; j + 1; 2j + 2; z) (2j + 2)(i=p) (1) j+1 (1 z) i=p F (j; j + 1; 1 + i=p; 1=z) (2j + <p> To bound J in the case of a bound final state, we return to Eq.
