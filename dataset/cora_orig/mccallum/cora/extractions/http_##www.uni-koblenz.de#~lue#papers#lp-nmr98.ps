Title: Disjunctive Logic Program Horn Program Control Program

Abstract: This paper presents an alternative view on propositional disjunctive logic program: Disjunctive program = Control program + Horn program. For this we introduce a program transformation which transforms a disjunctive logic program into a Horn program and a so called control program. The control program consists of only disjunctions of new propositional atoms and controls the "execution" of the Horn program. The relationship between original and transformed programs is established by using circumscription. Based on this relationship a new minimal model reasoning approach is developed. Due to the transformation it is straightforward to incorporate SLD-resolution into the proof procedure.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm presented below can be combined with a existing theorem prover to get a sound and complete minimal model reasoning procedure. An example of such an approach can be found in <ref> (Aravindan 1996) </ref> Our method is based on SLD-resolution due to the CH-transformation. An SLD-resolution proof procedure provides a way to compute answers for a goal from a definite logic program.

Reference-contexts: Query Answering under Minimal Model Semantics In this section we discuss how to answer queries under minimal model semantics. Because positive query can be answered by any existing theorem prover, for example PROTEIN <ref> (Baumgartner & Furbach 1994) </ref>, we concentrate only on negative query, that is, for a given atom q, to evaluate if :q is true in all minimal models. The algorithm presented below can be combined with a existing theorem prover to get a sound and complete minimal model reasoning procedure.
