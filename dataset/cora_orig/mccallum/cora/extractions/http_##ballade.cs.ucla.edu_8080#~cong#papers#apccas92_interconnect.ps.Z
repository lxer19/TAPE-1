Abstract: We survey our recent work in the analysis and design of interconnect topologies for high-speed VLSI. Results include: a new, fast distributed RLC analysis method based on a two-pole approximation; an A-tree formulation for performance-driven interconnect; an optimal wiresizing algorithm; and new critical-path dependent routing tree algorithms.

In this case, the t 2 (T ) and t 3 (T ) terms can no longer be ignored in the interconnect design.

Reference-contexts: However, in the design of high-speed interconnects, the minimum delay is no longer achieved by a minimum Steiner tree [30]. Figure 1 shows the simulation results of a minimum Steiner tree and a routing tree produced by the BRBC algorithm in <ref> [6] </ref> (which minimizes both the total wirelength and the longest source-sink path of the routing tree). We can see clearly that the latter tree results in a smaller delay.

Reference-contexts: These results are discussed in detail in <ref> [7] </ref>. In what follows, our goal is to design routing tree T such that t 1 (T ) + t 2 (T ) + t 3 (T ) is minimized. <p> The lower bound computation enables us to conclude that 45% of the A-trees constructed by our algorithm are optimal and on average the cost of A-trees by our algorithm are 4% away from the optimal.

Hence, it is much more efficient for very large interconnect structures. Details of these results are presented in <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The most accurate and complete method of solution is to solve 3-D (or 2-D) time-variant Maxwell equations <ref> [11, 25] </ref>. At this level, the effect of electrical and geometric parameters on circuit performance can be investigated in great detail. For instance, the scattering of waveform at a wire bend (or a discontinuity) can be evaluated precisely [2]. <p> To achieve performance-driven interconnect design, an analytical closed-form solution for the performance evaluation is essential: only an analytical solution can reveal the relationship between the performance and the design parameters, and thus be used as an objective function within the layout design process. Elmore <ref> [11] </ref> and Rubinstein et al. [25] presented an analytical closed-form solution for estimating the delay in a distributed RC circuit. Chan and Schlag analyzed the lower bound on the delay in an RC-mesh circuit [4]. <p> The algorithm creates monotone paths to all sinks n i via its motivation from the upper bound on Elmore delay in Eq.(6) an upper bound that is independent of topology. If we consider the actual Elmore delay formula <ref> [11] </ref>, we may develop useful intuitions for routing tree construction with respect to critical sinks. 2 Figure 3 (a)-(c) shows the 1-Steiner tree, the A-tree, and an optimal tree for a given net N with identified critical sink n c . <p> Let T v denote the subtree of T rooted at v, and let c v denote the node capacitance of v. The tree capacitance C v of T v is the sum of node and edge capacitances in T v <ref> [11] </ref> [25].

Reference-contexts: Moreover, none of these algorithms study the impact of wiresizing on interconnect delay minimization. Although wiresizing was used by Fisher and Kung <ref> [12] </ref> in H-tree clock routing, the general wiresizing problem for arbitrary routing topology has not been well studied before. In this section, we study the interconnect design problem under a distributed RC delay model developed by Rubinstein et al. [25].

Reference-contexts: For example, Lin and Du [18] use a linear delay approximation so that their method updates the module placement to reduce the rectilinear distance between sources and critical sinks. Other path-dependent placement methodologies include those due to Hauge et al. <ref> [13] </ref> and Teig et al. [28]. For any net on a timing-critical path, the path-dependent approach affords an explicit routing constraint with respect to the delay to the net's critical sink. Arguably, net-dependent methods only provide implicit routing constraints, e.g., by limiting the bounding box half-perimeter.

Reference-contexts: A rectilinear Steiner tree T is an A-tree if for any node p in T , the path connecting the source n 0 to p in the tree is a shortest path. A-trees are a generalization of the rectilinear Steiner arborescences studied in <ref> [22] </ref>. There are several reasons that we are interested in A-trees. First, any A-tree is always a shortest path tree (SP T ). Therefore, the t 2 (T ) term is always minimum.

Reference-contexts: A simplified approach considers a 1-D problem, i.e., solving a 1-D telegraph equation [8].

For general interconnect structures, an analytic solution is almost impossible to obtain because of the irregular boundary conditions encountered in solving the telegraph equation. Another direction of interconnect performance evaluation involves circuit simulation based on numerical methods.
