Appendix 2 contains the source codes in Mathematica for the implementation of the Contour Method based on the Raghavan and Roth <ref> [11] </ref> approach. 3 Chapter 2 The IKP of Serial Manipulators 2.1 Background The IKP for 6R manipulators has been studied for more than three decades. Earlier work includes that of Pieper [3] and Roth et al. [4]. <p> Finally, Lee and Liang [9, 10] reduced the same problem to a 16th-degree univariate polynomial. Using different elimination procedures, Raghavan and Roth <ref> [11, 12] </ref> and Lee [13]|also see [14] and [15]|provided different approaches for the computation of the coefficients of the univariate polynomial. Examples of 6R manipulators with 16 real solutions can be found in [3, 13, 16]. <p> As explained in <ref> [11, 14] </ref>, by eliminating all joint angles except for one, the univariate characteristic polynomial of the manipulator can be obtained from the above equations. In general, all equations give the same final result and there should be no reason to prefer one equation or the other. <p> Similarly, the left- and the right-hand sides of eq.(2.19) represent the position vector directed from the origin of F 3 to the origin of F 6 , in frame F 3 . By adopting the nomenclature in <ref> [7, 11, 14] </ref>, we define four vectors in the forms ~ f ~ f ( 4 ; 5 ) = 4 f 2 3 ~ h ~ h ( 1 ) = 4 h 2 3 1 b 1 (2.20b) 2 r 1 r 3 5 = X 3 Q 4 <p> 1 ) = 4 h 2 3 1 b 1 (2.20b) 2 r 1 r 3 5 = X 3 Q 4 u 5 (2.20c) 2 n 1 n 3 5 = Q T 9 The corresponding expressions for the components of the above four vectors can be found in <ref> [11, 14] </ref>; they are given below for quick reference: f 1 = c 4 g 1 + s 4 g 2 + a 3 f 3 = 3 (s 4 g 1 c 4 g 2 ) + 3 g 3 + d 3 r 2 = 3 (s 4 m <p> 5 s 4 c 4 s 5 c 5 1 ] T (2.31a) Before proceeding to the next step, i.e. derivation of the contour equations, we describe the second approach for deriving the 14 closure equations. 12 2.6 The Raghavan and Roth Approach Following a similar procedure, Raghavan and Roth <ref> [11, 14] </ref> also used eqs.(2.21) and (2.22) to derive the 14 closure equations, as explained below. <p> As proved by Raghavan and Roth <ref> [11] </ref>, the eight foregoing equations have the same power products as f , h, g and i. <p> This special structure of matrix Q can be exploited to eliminate the joint angles 1 and 2 in a more efficient way than the other methods <ref> [11, 14] </ref>. It is noteworthy that Lee et al. [15] also provided 14 scalar equations using the column vectors in the left- and right-hand sides of eq.(2.14b). <p> Hence, any one of eqs.(3.5), (3.7a) or (3.7b) can be used to eliminate one more unknown joint variable in order to derive the bivariate contour equations. Before deriving these equations, we describe the procedure that Raghavan and Roth <ref> [11] </ref> proposed to eliminate 1 and 2 from the set of 14 closure equations. Their method is more efficient and suitable for symbolic computation than the other methods. <p> In this way, two equations are obtained free of 1 and 2 . However, this elimination process is not suitable for symbolic computation. Instead, Raghavan and Roth <ref> [11] </ref> derived the two foregoing equations in a more compact form. <p> On the other hand, h x , i x , f x and g x represent the first components of vectors h, i, f and g, respectively, and other components are defined in a similar way. Furthermore, ffi 1 and ffi 2 have the same definitions as in <ref> [11] </ref>, namely, ffi 1 p 2 + q 2 + (r d 1 ) 2 a 2 ffi 2 pu + qv + (r d 1 )w Also Note that, in deriving expressions (3.13a-b) and (3.13c-b), we assume that a 1 6= 0. <p> The basic approach that was developed by Lee and Liang [9, 10] and later by Raghavan and Roth <ref> [11] </ref>, is to reduce the equations to a univariate 16th-degree polynomial equation. However, the problem of computing roots of polynomials of degree 16 can be ill-conditioned [30]. On the other hand, the whole process of root-finding is rather slow for practical applications. <p> approaches lead to the same set of solutions; however, the shape of the three contours from which the intersection points are selected, is different for each approach. 5.1 The DH Parameters and Pose of the EE The DH parameters of the 6R manipulator are the same as those given in <ref> [11] </ref>.

[15] also provided 14 scalar equations using the column vectors in the left- and right-hand sides of eq.(2.14b). <p> Below, we briefly study these cases. 4.1 Manipulators with Prismatic Joints The basic algebraic structure of the 14 closure equations remains the same, regardless of whether a joint is revolute or prismatic. As explained by Raghavan and Roth <ref> [14] </ref> and others [22, 23, 25], if the ith joint is a revolute then we have c i and s i as the variables which form the power products, while if the same joint is prismatic, we have d i and d 2 i , instead. <p> Ultimately, the system is again reduced as a system of the form (2.30), but the number of equations is now less than 14. A detailed treatment of the foregoing cases can be found in <ref> [14, 20] </ref>. 4.2 Special Manipulators As defined by Mavroidis [21, 20], if for a given manipulator, certain conditions exist between its DH parameters that cause the manipulator to have a lower-degree characteristic polynomial than for the same joint types and number, then the manipulator is called special.

Reference-contexts: The basic approach to solve the IKP is to hypothetically disconnect the kinematic chain of the manipulator at two joints, e.g. joints 3 and 6, to obtain two subchains or subloops <ref> [15] </ref>. The first subchain goes from joint 3 to joint 6 via joints 4 and 5, while the second subchain goes from 6 to 3 via the EE and joints 1 and 2. <p> This special structure of matrix Q can be exploited to eliminate the joint angles 1 and 2 in a more efficient way than the other methods [11, 14].

Reference-contexts: In [24], a semigraphical method was proposed to solve the inverse kinematics of 6R manipulators. Using this method, the solutions are found as the intersection of three contours defined by three bivariate equations. This approach can also be studied in the context of contact of curves and surfaces <ref> [17] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This is done by assuming that the axis of this revolute coincides with Z 7 and the associated joint angle 7 is determined from the Denavit-Hartenberg <ref> [18] </ref> notation in terms of the given pose of the EE. Hence, the results of the analysis of the one-degree-of-freedom (one-DOF) single-loop 7R linkage can be applied for the analysis of its equivalent 6R manipulator. <p> However, the key problem is to select an appropriate set of equations from which the unknown joint angles can be computed without introducing spurious solutions into the final results. To model a 6R manipulator, we adopt the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) formalism <ref> [18] </ref> and the nomenclature used by Tsai and Morgan [7].

Reference-contexts: manipulators in different aspects, namely, * it allows the user to interactively participate in the solution process; * the proposed method is applicable in the case of degenerate configurations where other methods fail to provide any result; and * the contours provide information on the numerical conditioning of each solution <ref> [19] </ref>. The method can be extended to cover other types of serial manipulators that have either prismatic joints or special architectures. Two examples are included to demonstrate the application of the method. In this context, computer programs are provided for applying the method to different manipulators. <p> for i = 1; : : : ; 7, such that the Z i -axis is aligned with the ith joint axis; the X i -axis is the common perpendicular of Z i1 and Z i , directed from the former to the latter axis (see also Chapter 4 in <ref> [19] </ref> for more details). In this way, all DH parameters are defined uniquely. <p> i g i ; g i = [ a i 0 d i ] T (2.9) From eqs.(2.4), (2.5a-b), (2.8b) and (2.9), we thus have g i Z i a i = X i b i (2.10) Note that there are other possible factorings of Q i as explained in <ref> [19] </ref>. We now define [ x ; y ; z ] T to be the position vector from the origin of F i to the origin of F 7 . <p> Different approaches, though conceptually similar, have been proposed for deriving these 14 equations. Here, we consider the two most common approaches to this problem, namely, the direct approach and the Raghavan and Roth approach. 10 2.5 The Direct Approach The direct approach was adopted by Angeles <ref> [19] </ref> (see Section 8.2.1 in this reference), Kohli and Osvatic [22], and Ghazvini [23]. <p> Therefore, eqs.(2.24) and (2.25) suffice to determine the five unknown joint angles contained therein. We can now create 8 new linearly independent equations with the same power products 1 as f , g, h and i.

Reference-contexts: As well, in the presence of a root yielding an angle , the polynomial degenerates into one of 15th-degree or less. On the other hand, the degenerate configurations cannot be treated using the univariate polynomial approach. In <ref> [24] </ref>, a semigraphical method was proposed to solve the inverse kinematics of 6R manipulators. Using this method, the solutions are found as the intersection of three contours defined by three bivariate equations. This approach can also be studied in the context of contact of curves and surfaces [17]. <p> Similarly, the two eqs.(3.11b) and (3.16b) can be also combined in the form of eq.(3.5). 18 3.2 Derivation of the Contour Equations In order to derive the bivariate contour equations, we must eliminate one more unknown from eq.(3.5). Following the procedure in <ref> [24] </ref>, we partition this equation into two systems, each with three homogeneous equations in y 3 , namely, D u y 3 = 0 (3.17a) where D u and D l are 3 fi 3 submatrices of D, their entries being bilinear in x 4 and x 5 . <p> Note that the shapes of the contours need not be the same as those in the foregoing reference; however, the intersection points are the same.
