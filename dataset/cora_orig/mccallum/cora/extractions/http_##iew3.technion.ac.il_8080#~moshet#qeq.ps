Title: On Stable Social Laws and Qualitative Equilibrium for Risk-Averse Agents  
Author: Moshe Tennenholtz

Abstract: This paper introduces and investigates the notion of qualitative equilibria, or stable social laws, in the context of qualitative decision making. Previous work in qualitative decision theory has used the maximin decision criterion for modelling qualitative decision making. When several decision-makers share a common environment, a corresponding notion of equilibrium can be defined. This notion can be associated with the concept of a stable social law. This paper initiates a basic study of stable social laws; in particular, it discusses the stability benefits one obtains from using social laws rather than simple conventions, the existence of stable social laws under various assumptions, the computation of stable social laws, and the representation of stable social laws in a graph theoretic framework.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, in <ref> (Brafman & Tennenholtz 1996) </ref> Brafman and Tennenholtz have shown general conditions under which an agent can be viewed as if it were a maximin agent (i.e., an agent which maximizes its worst case payoff). However, the corresponding notion of equilibrium has not yet been investigated. <p> This kind of behavior is appropriate where there is some ordinal relation on possible outcomes. In such situations all that matters to agents is the order of payoffs and not their exact value. The precise conditions under which such modelling is an appropriate one are discussed in <ref> (Brafman & Tennenholtz 1996) </ref>. We will require that a social law suggested for a particular encounter will guarantee to the agents a certain payoff, and that it will be stable; there should be no incentive to deviate from it assuming the agents are risk-averse agents. <p> Namely, we use the maximin decision criterion to be discussed below. The precise conditions under which an agent can be viewed as if it uses this decision criterion are discussed in <ref> (Brafman & Tennen-holtz 1996) </ref>. This modeling perspective becomes especially appealing if an agent does not know the payoff function of the other agent. Definition 2.2 : Let S i be the set of strategies available to agent i, and let u i be the utility function of agent i.

Reference-contexts: Proof of Theorem 5.2 (sketch): The proof that the problem is in NP is straightforward. The proof the problem is NP-hard is by resuction from 3-SAT <ref> (Garey & Johnson 1979) </ref>. Given a 3-CNF formula ' we generate a game g, for which a stable social law exists if and only if ' is satisfiable. We take the efficiency parameter t to be equal to 0, and let t 0 be a positive real number.

Reference-contexts: As it turns out, this distinction is quite important and useful in the non-bayesian context frequently adopted in AI. 1 See <ref> (Sandholm & Lesser 1995) </ref> for a detailed discussion of this point. We will discuss social laws for multi-agent encounters using a game-theoretic framework which is tailored for assumptions made in the AI literature, and especially in recent work on qualitative decision making. <p> way a rational agent is viewed in the AI literature, such as in work on conditional planning (Warren 1976; Peot & Smith 1992; Etzioni et al. 1992; Genesereth & Nourbakhsh 1993; 4 This is not to say that other assumptions are not treated by the DAI literature; see for example <ref> (Sandholm & Lesser 1995) </ref>. Safra & Tennenholtz 1994). Using a Game-Theoretic terminology, in this work we developed an equilibrium theory for risk-averse agents (Luce & Raiffa 1957; Dubois & Prade 1995; Brafman & Tennenholtz 1996).

Reference-contexts: The basic idea of the Artificial Social Systems approach is to add a mechanism, called a social law, that will minimize the need for both centralized control and on-line resolution of conflicts. In a mobile robots setting, for example, such a social law may consist of various traffic constraints <ref> (Shoham & Tennenholtz 1992) </ref>. More generally, a social law is a set of restrictions on the agents' activities which allow them enough freedom on one hand, but at the same time constrain them so that they will not interfere with each other.
