Abstract: Compression with Reversible Embedded Wavelets (CREW) is a unified lossless and lossy continuous-tone still image compression system. It is wavelet-based using a "reversible" approximation of one of the best wavelet filters. Reversible wavelets are linear filters with non-linear rounding which implement exact-reconstruction systems with minimal precision integer arithmetic. Wavelet coefficients are encoded in a bit-significance embedded order, allowing lossy compression by simply truncating the compressed data. For coding of coefficients, CREW uses a method similar to Shapiro's zerotree, and a completely novel method called Horizon. Horizon coding is a context based coding that takes advantage of the spatial and spectral information available in the wavelet domain. CREW provides state of the art lossless compression of medical images (greater than 8 bits deep), and lossy and lossless compression of 8-bit deep images with a single system. CREW has reasonable software and hardware implementations.

Reference-contexts: Tables 1 and 2 are the lossless results, for the medical and the USC images respectively. The results related to the USC images (Table 2) are compared with JPEG lossless (with QM-coder), and bit-plane JBIG of the gray coded image <ref> [AT94] </ref>. The results on medical imaging (Table 1) are compared with DPCM which uses three neighbor pixels for prediction and Huffman codes the prediction errors. Table 3 is the results of lossy compression of the USC images.

Reference-contexts: Horizon embedded coding, introduced below, is a spatial-spectral context model which uses the same embedding order, i.e., bit-significance, as the Zerotree. Non-embedded context models have been proposed to encode signed integers which take advantage of spatial correlations of coefficients <ref> [Lan91] </ref>. In Horizon coding the high correlation of neighboring pixels, in addition to the similarities of different bands, are utilized by context dependent entropy coding. The Horizon context dependent coding is especially attractive for encoding the low order bits, which must be encoded in a lossless system.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Since CREW uses a "reversible" approximation of one of the best known wavelet filters, its performance is equal to or better than other existing methods in both lossy and lossless modes. It encodes the wavelet coefficients in a bit-significance embedded order similar to Shapiro <ref> [Sha93] </ref>, and a completely novel method called Horizon. Horizon coding is a context-based coding that takes advantage of the spatial and spectral information available in the wavelet domain. <p> Remark 3: Both normalized Hadamard transform and the normalized TS-transform have especially simple implementations in two dimensions, the domain of digital images. Recall that in the separable two dimensional wavelet transform the image is decomposed into four blocks, the so-called LL, LH, HL, and HH <ref> [Sha93] </ref>. Each L corresponds to an application of the low-pass filter h 0 , and each H corresponds to an application of the high-pass filter h 1 . <p> Of special importance for us are the so-called "embedded" coders. Briefly, an embedded coding is a system in which the coded bit stream is ordered by visual significance or, more accurately, ordered with respect to some error metric cf. also <ref> [Sha93] </ref>. The embedded order used in this paper is bit-significance in the transform domain, the same as used in [Sha93]. The Zerotree [Sha93] is an efficient embedded coding method of the wavelet coefficients, which takes advantage of the inherent similarity of different bands in the transform domain. <p> Briefly, an embedded coding is a system in which the coded bit stream is ordered by visual significance or, more accurately, ordered with respect to some error metric cf. also <ref> [Sha93] </ref>.

The descendants are defined with respect to a tree structure defined on the wavelet coefficients, which takes advantage of the similarity of the bands at different resolutions <ref> [Sha93] </ref>. The other part of the Zerotree embedded coding is a bit-significance embedding method to encode signed integers.
