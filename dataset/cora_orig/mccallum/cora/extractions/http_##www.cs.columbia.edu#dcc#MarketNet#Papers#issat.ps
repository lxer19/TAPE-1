Abstract: 1 This research is sponsored in part by the USAF, Air Force Materiel Command, under contract F30602-97-1-0252, "MarketNet: A Survivable, Market-based Architecture for Large-scale Information Systems". The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the official policies or endorsements, either expressed or implied of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Air Force, or the U.S. Government. Abstract MarketNet provides hedging mechanisms to support survivability under loss or attacks. Resource managers replicate resources to hedge against loss. In deciding on creation and location of such backup replicas, a resource manager seeks to balance the investment in current costs of maintaining replicas, against the future value of the backup in case of a loss. Currency provides a uniform resource instrumentation that reflects the net-present-value of resource loss and admits optimized load redistribution and graceful degradation upon loss. A loss of a resource reduces the supply, thus automatically causing clients to redirect their demand to backup replicas. Reduced availability results in rising prices of the replicated resources creat ing a natural selection process where high-priority clients can apply their budget to continue and obtain high QoS, while low priority clients are priced-out. Thus a loss results in graceful selective degradation of services that optimizes the balance between available resources and demands.
