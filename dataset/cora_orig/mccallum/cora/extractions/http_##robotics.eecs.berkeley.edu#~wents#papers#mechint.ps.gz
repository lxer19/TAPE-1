Abstract: Caltech CDS Technical Report 96-013 Abstract Many numerical integrators for mechanical system simulation are created by using discrete algorithms to approximate the continuous equations of motion. In this paper, we present a procedure to construct time-stepping algorithms that approximate the flow of continuous ODE's for mechanical systems by discretizing Hamilton's principle rather than the equations of motion. The discrete equations share similarities to the continuous equations by preserving invariants, including the symplectic form and the momentum map. We first present a formulation of discrete mechanics along with a discrete variational principle. We then show that the resulting equations of motion preserve the symplectic form and that this formulation of mechanics leads to conservation laws from a discrete version of Noether's theorem. We then use the discrete mechanics formulation to develop a procedure for constructing mechanical integrators for continuous Lagrangian systems. We apply the construction procedure to the rigid body and the double spherical pendulum to demonstrate numerical properties of the integrators.

Reference-contexts: Some of the Literature. This paper uses the discrete variational principle presented in (Veselov, 1988) and again in (Veselov, 1991) and (Moser and Veselov, 1991). It is shown in (Veselov, 1988) that the DEL equations preserve a symplectic form. The same discrete mechanics procedure is derived in <ref> (Baez and Gilliam, 1995) </ref> using an algebraic approach, and they also show that there is a discrete Noether's theorem for infinitesimal symmetry. Various authors have proposed versions of discrete mechanics. Some study discrete mechanics without the motivation of constructing integration schemes while this is a definite motivation for other authors. <p> We call the evolution equations discrete Euler-Lagrange (DEL) equations. The results in this section have appeared in (Veselov, 1988), (Veselov, 1991), (Moser and Veselov, 1991) and in <ref> (Baez and Gilliam, 1995) </ref> but are rederived here in a consistent notation for completeness and clarity. Given a configuration space, Q, a discrete Lagrangian is a map L : Q fi Q ! R. We will give a procedure that defines the evolution map for the system. <p> Spacetime Integrators Since the method here is variational by nature and focuses on the temporal behavior, it should be helpful in the development of spacetime integrators by synthesis with existing finite element methods. Acknowledgements We first would like to thank Andrew Lewis for pointing out <ref> (Baez and Gilliam, 1995) </ref>. We would also like to thank Richard Murray and Abhi Jain for help with an initial investigation into mechanical integrators. We appreciate the useful comments and discussions provided by Francisco Armero and Oscar Gonzalez. We also thank Robert MacKay and Shmuel Weissman for useful discussions.

Reference-contexts: The fluctuations in energy appear to be related to the constraint forces. The middle graph is a plot of the multipliers versus time, and the fluctuations in the multipliers is correlated to the fluctuations in energy. This relationship has also been noticed in <ref> (Barth and Leimkuhler, 1996a) </ref>, and they use variable step size to decrease the energy oscillation. 6 Conclusion This paper presented a procedure to construct mechanical integrators for Lagrangian systems and applied the method to the rigid body and the double spherical pendulum.

Comments on Other Algorithms The Verlet algorithm (Verlet, 1967) is important in molecular dynamics simulation (Leimkuhler and Skeel, 1994). <p> For tree structured multibody systems, one can show that the linear equations involving the Jacobian can be solved in linear time. Sparse matrix techniques and symplectic integration are also used for multibody systems in <ref> (Barth and Leimkuhler, 1996b) </ref>. To improve the scaling of the entries in the Jacobian, one can multiply the DEL equations by powers of h.

Reference-contexts: One may proceed analogously to the derivation in this paper to create energy-momentum integrators possibly based on discretizing the principle of least action. Nonholonomic Systems. The method presented in this paper treats holonomic constraints and one would like to generalize the method to treat nonholonomic constraints, as in <ref> (Bloch et al., 1996) </ref>. For nonholonomic systems, the standard symplectic form is not preserved, and there are momentum equations and not conservation laws. Also, energy can be conserved in these systems.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that if the energy and momentum map include all the integrals from a certain class (depending on the smoothness available) that one cannot create integrators that are symplectic, energy preserving, and momentum preserving unless they coincidentally integrate the equations exactly up to a time parametrization (see <ref> (Ge and Marsden, 1988) </ref> for the exact statement). Thus, mechanical integrators divide into two overall classes, symplectic-momentum and energy-momentum integrators.

Accuracy The construction method produces 2-step methods that have a second order local truncation error.

Reference-contexts: For both examples, the momentum, energy, accuracy, and efficiency is examined. The examples suggest that accurate results are achieved with large step sizes.

It is shown in (Veselov, 1988) that the DEL equations preserve a symplectic form.

We must note, however, that energy conservation alone does not imply good performance as is shown in <ref> (Ortiz, 1986) </ref>. In our examples, we observe energy oscillations around a constant value, which we take as a good indication. When comparing energy-momentum and symplectic-momentum methods, it should be kept in mind that energy-momentum methods should be monitored using how well they conserve the symplectic form.

Reference-contexts: We compare the integrator to an energy-momentum integrator. For both examples, the momentum, energy, accuracy, and efficiency is examined.

This paper uses the discrete variational principle presented in <ref> (Veselov, 1988) </ref> and again in (Veselov, 1991) and (Moser and Veselov, 1991). It is shown in (Veselov, 1988) that the DEL equations preserve a symplectic form. The same discrete mechanics procedure is derived in (Baez and Gilliam, 1995) using an algebraic approach, and they also show that there is a discrete Noether's theorem for infinitesimal symmetry. Various authors have proposed versions of discrete mechanics. <p> In (Maeda, 1981), the author presents a version of discrete mechanics based on the concept of a difference space. The author later shows how to derive the discrete equations from a discrete version of Hamilton's variational principle, the same discretization later used in <ref> (Veselov, 1988) </ref>. (Maeda, 1981) also presents a version of Noether's theorem. A different approach to discrete mechanics for point mass systems not derived from a variational principle is shown in (Labudde and Greenspan, 1974), (Labudde and Greenspan, 1976a), and (Labudde and Greenspan, 1976b). These algorithms preserve energy and momentum. <p> These algorithms preserve energy and momentum. Another discussion of discretizing variational principles is given in (MacKay, 1992) and in (Lewis and Kostelec, 1996). It is our opinion that the approach in <ref> (Veselov, 1988) </ref> we adopt in this paper is the most appealing theoretically of these methods and, in addition, is numerically competitive. Some authors discretize the principle of least action instead of Hamilton's principle. Algorithms that conserve the Hamiltonian are derived in (Itoh and Abe, 1988) based on difference quotients. <p> One recovers the Verlet algorithm if the Lagrangian system has no constraints. This result also appears in (Gillilan and Wilson, 1992), and the discrete variational principle they apply is similar to the principle in <ref> (Veselov, 1988) </ref>. However, they don't extend the result to constraints or more general Lagrangians and do not use the discrete Lagrangian definition in this paper. The emphasis in (Gillilan and Wilson, 1992) is also on calculating a path given end point conditions. <p> We call the evolution equations discrete Euler-Lagrange (DEL) equations. The results in this section have appeared in <ref> (Veselov, 1988) </ref>, (Veselov, 1991), (Moser and Veselov, 1991) and in (Baez and Gilliam, 1995) but are rederived here in a consistent notation for completeness and clarity. Given a configuration space, Q, a discrete Lagrangian is a map L : Q fi Q ! R.
