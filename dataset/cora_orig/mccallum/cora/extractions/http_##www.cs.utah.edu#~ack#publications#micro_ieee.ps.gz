Title: SPECIAL ISSUE OF THE IEEE PROCEEDINGS ON ASYNCHRONOUS CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS 1 Application Specific Asynchronous
Author: Hans Jacobson, Ganesh Gopalakrishnan 
Keyword: programmable control, micro-program, micro-control, micro-engine, chaining, asynchronous circuits, self-timed.  
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in asynchronous circuits, programmable asynchronous controllers based on the idea of microprogramming have not been actively pursued. Since programmable control is widely used in many commercial ASICs to allow late correction of design errors, to easily upgrade product families, to meet the time to market, and even effect run-time modifications to control in adaptive systems, we consider it crucial that self-timed techniques support efficient programmable control. This is especially true given that asynchronous (self-timed) circuits are well suited for realizing control-intensive designs. We offer a practical solution to programmable asynchronous control in the form of application-specific micro-programmed asynchronous controllers (or microengines). The features of our solution include a modular and easily extensible datapath structure, support for two main styles of handshaking (namely two-phase and four-phase), and many efficiency measures based on exploiting concurrency between operations and employing efficient circuit structures. Our results demonstrate that the proposed microengine can yield high performance|in fact performance close to that offered by automated high-level synthesis tools targeting custom hard-wired burstmode machines.

Reference-contexts: According to <ref> [6] </ref> a factor of 1.5 in performance improvement and a 40% smaller area can be attributed to single rail over double rail in a Tangram implementation of a similar, but more complex, error decoder for the DCC player.

Reference-contexts: No more changes are visible in the microinstruction bits since we continue to iterate over the SYNDROME loop instruction until n becomes negative. A. Results The Tangram implementation described in <ref> [17] </ref>, which was targeted for low-power, used dual rail logic and a 1.2 micron technology and was reported to have an approximate worst case cycle time of 20 microseconds, each cycle decoding a sequence of 32 8-bit input words, and a core area of 2.0 mm 2 .

Reference-contexts: We also implemented the CD player error decoder in a 0.6 micron technology 1 and performed post-layout SPICE simulation of the same. The cycle time under worst case transistor models and temperature was 1.46 microseconds. Feature size scaling under constant field assumption <ref> [27] </ref>, except for voltage, would result in gate delays in a 1.2 micron 5V technology being approximately 2.5 times that of a 0.6 micron 3V technology while wire delays stay the same.
