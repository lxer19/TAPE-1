Title: On the Input-to-State Stability Property  
Author: Eduardo D. Sontag 
Address: New Brunswick, NJ 08903  
Affiliation: Department of Mathematics Rutgers University,  
Abstract: The "input to state stability" (iss) property provides a natural framework in which to formulate notions of stability with respect to input perturbations. In this expository paper, we review various equivalent definitions expressed in stability, Lyapunov-theoretic, and dissipation terms. We sketch some applications to the stabilization of cascades of systems and of linear systems subject to control saturation.

Reference-contexts: The hypotheses in Theorem 5 can be relaxed considerably. For instance, controllability can be weakened, and the result is also valid if instead of sat one uses a more general bounded saturation function which satisfies: (1) near the origin, is in a sector <ref> [ 1 ; 2 ] </ref>: 0&lt; 1 (r) 2 for all 0&lt;jrj1, and (2) sign (r)(r)&gt;&gt;0 if jrj&gt;1. A different line of work concerns linear systems subject to control saturation in the case in which the matrix A is not stable, but still has no eigenvalues with positive real part.

This notion allows replacing sup norms on controls with a fading-memory L 1 estimate, as follows, and is of great use in robust control applications.

Reference-contexts: The iss notion was originally introduced in <ref> [15] </ref> and has since been employed by several authors in deriving results on control of nonlinear systems. It can be stated in several equivalent manners, which indicates that it is at least a mathematically natural concept: dissipation, robustness margins, and classical Lyapunov-like definitions. <p> Mathematically it is grounded instead in more classical converse Lyapunov arguments in the style of Massera, Kurzweil, and Zubov.)

(Note that sufficiency is trivial, since forward completeness follows from the fact that trajectories stay <p> Nonetheless, the dissipation inequality (5) provides in principle a good tool, playing the same role as Lyapunov's direct method for asymptotic stability. Actually, even more useful is the following variant, which is the original definition of "iss-Lyapunov function" in <ref> [15] </ref>. Consider a storage function with the property that there exist two class K functions ff and so that the implication jxj (juj) ) rV (x) f (x; u) ff (jxj) (9) holds for each state x 2 R n and control value u 2 R m . <p> These conclusions are implicit in the proofs given in <ref> [15] </ref> and [22]. <p> a causal map F : L m 1;e !

Reference-contexts: Smoothness is an extremely useful property in this context, as one may then use iterated derivatives of V along trajetories for various design as well as analysis questions, in particular in so-called "backstepping" design techniques. In the terminology of <ref> [31, 6] </ref>, (5) is a dissipation inequality with storage function V and supply function w (u; x) = (juj) ff (jxj). (In the context of dissipative systems one often postulates the equivalent integral form V (x (t; x 0 ; u)) V (x 0 ) R t 0 w (u (s);
