Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment optimization is done by generating a set of tentative treatment plans, evaluating them and selecting the plan closest to achieving a set of conicting treatment objectives. The evaluation of potential plans involves making tradeofis among competing possible outcomes. Multiattribute decision theory provides a framework for specifying such tradeofis and using them to select optimal actions. Using these concepts, we have developed a plan-ranking model which ranks a set of tentative treatment plans from best to worst. Heuristics are used to reflne this model so that it reects the clinical condition of the patient being treated and the practice preferences of the physician prescribing the treatment. A flgure of merit is computed for each tentative plan, and is used to rank the plans. The approach described is very general and can be used for other medical domains having similar characteristics. The flgure of merit can also be used as an objective function by computer programs that attempt to automatically generate an optimal treatment plan.

Reference-contexts: These models have been developed by radiation physicists to characterize the dose response of tumors and normal tissues. These models use Dose Volume Histograms (DVH) <ref> [1] </ref>, a plot of the dose-volume frequency distribution in an organ. DVH s provide a graphical summary of the dose distribution in a volume of interest. For the tumor, the numeric model computes the probability that the tumor is eradicated. This is known as the Tumor Control Probability (TCP).

Reference-contexts: Clinical decision analysis has been well-studied and is known for its ability to handle the tradeofis faced by the decision maker [10, 16, 17, 18]. In particular, decision analysis has been used as a methodology for evaluating therapy plans <ref> [2] </ref> and for selecting among therapeutic options [4]. For some di-cult decision problems, it is not possible to assign a single utility to the outcomes.

This is known as the Tumor Control Probability (TCP). We currently are using the TCP model by Goitein <ref> [3] </ref>. For each normal tissue, the numeric model computes the probability that some clinical complication occurs due to radiation to that tissue. It is known as the Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP). We currently are using the NTCP models by Kutcher [7] and Lyman [8, 9].

Reference-contexts: This paper describes our plan-ranking model and how it difiers from previous work done in this fleld. Background Expected utility decision making is a methodology for selecting a sequence of possible actions from many competing sequences of actions having difierent outcomes <ref> [5, 12] </ref>. The desirability (utility) of each outcome is assessed and so are the probabilities of events that may occur due to a possible action. The sequence of actions which maximizes the expected utility is chosen.

Reference-contexts: For some di-cult decision problems, it is not possible to assign a single utility to the outcomes. In those cases, a multiattribute utility model is used; the outcomes are divided into component attributes and the utility of each attribute is assessed individually <ref> [6] </ref>. To use the axiom of maximizing expected utility, various combining functions have been used to derive a single utility from the individual attribute utilities. These functions depend on both the decision problem, and the range and units of the individual utility values.

Reference-contexts: For each normal tissue, the numeric model computes the probability that some clinical complication occurs due to radiation to that tissue. It is known as the Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP). We currently are using the NTCP models by Kutcher <ref> [7] </ref> and Lyman [8, 9]. Not all issues have the same clinical relevance in the evaluation of the treatment plans. Thus, to obtain the utility of an issue, we combine the probability of the occurrence of an untoward event with the clinical relevance of the issue in the plan.

Reference-contexts: We are interested in those patients for whom radiotherapy is one of the selected treatment modalities. The goal of the radiation treatment is to uniformly irradiate all target volumes to the prescribed doses, and at the same time, to minimize radiation induced damage to any nearby normal tissue <ref> [11] </ref>. Radiotherapy treatment optimization is done by generating a set of tentative treatment plans, evaluating them and selecting the plan closest to achieving the treatment goal.
