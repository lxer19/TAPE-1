Abstract: In [16], we proposed a new service called REnegotiated Deterministic Variable Bit Rate Service (RED-VBR). RED-VBR attempts to strike an efficient balance among tradeoffs in quality of service, achievable network utilization, and method of dealing with overload situations. The approach is based on deterministic guarantees with client controlled renegotiation of traffic and QOS parameters and graceful adaptation during overload periods. In this paper, we introduce a new connection admission control algorithm for RED-VBR which bounds the renegotiation failure probability. We evaluate the scheme using two traces of MPEG-compressed video and show that, even with simple renegotiation polices and relatively low renegotiation frequencies, high network utilization in the range of 50% to 80% can be achieved. For traffic that is bursty over long intervals, this represents a 100% to 150% improvement in network utilization compared to deterministic service. Compared to a statistical service, our approach allows more graceful and client-controlled QOS degradation during overload period.

Reference-contexts: Our experience with the Tenet Real-Time Protocol Suite indicates that the time to process a connection establishment message is around 2 msec on a DECstation 500/240 <ref> [1] </ref>. The bulk of this time is spent in overheads such as user-kernel crossing. The time to actually perform admission control tests and routing computation is relatively small (0.2 to 0.5 msec).

Reference-contexts: Most existing signaling systems have relatively low signaling throughputs. For example, our measurements show that a commercial ATM switch can process only about 50 connection establishment requests per second. However, the low throughputs are more an artifact of poor implementation than the intrinsic complexity of signaling. In <ref> [2] </ref>, it has been shown that by optimizing the software, a two-order of magnitude performance gain can be achieved for a portion of the signaling software.

Reference-contexts: The movie is digitized to 384 by 288 pixels and compressed at 24 frames per second with pattern IBBPBBPBBPBB. Both sequences were compressed using constant-quality MPEG 1 compression performed in software (see <ref> [6] </ref> for details of the MPEG compression algorithm). Plotting the bounding rate vs. interval length, the figure shows that the D-BIND model captures the sources' burstiness over multiple interval lengths.

Reference-contexts: In [16], we introduced a new approach to support real-time VBR video called REnegotiated Deterministic Variable Bit Rate or RED-VBR service. The approach utilizes two important properties of compressed video. First, compressed video traffic usually exhibits burstiness over multiple time-scales <ref> [7] </ref>. At least two levels of burstiness are important for a resource allocation algorithm: burstiness on a shorter time scale due to the coding algorithm and small-time-scale variations in picture information content, and burstiness on a longer time scale due to scene changes. <p> Thus, "heavy-tails" that may be found in a stationary bit-rate distribution (e.g., <ref> [7] </ref>) are unlikely to occur in this scenario.

Reference-contexts: Our scheme differs from traditional schemes for supporting VBR traffic (e.g., [9, 11]) in that RED-VBR is dynamic, adapting to long-time-scale dynamics of traffic characteristics. The recent work on RCBR <ref> [8] </ref>, is closely related to our RED-VBR service, except that [8] proposes a renegotiated service on top of a CBR service rather than a deterministic variable bit rate (D-VBR). <p> Our scheme differs from traditional schemes for supporting VBR traffic (e.g., [9, 11]) in that RED-VBR is dynamic, adapting to long-time-scale dynamics of traffic characteristics. The recent work on RCBR <ref> [8] </ref>, is closely related to our RED-VBR service, except that [8] proposes a renegotiated service on top of a CBR service rather than a deterministic variable bit rate (D-VBR). By using a more efficient base service (D-VBR rather than CBR) RED-VBR will require fewer renegotiations than RCBR for the same level of resource utilization.

Reference-contexts: Second, most of the video compression algorithms such as MPEG and JPEG have some type of quality control factor (Q-factor). By tuning this factor, a video source can tradeoff its bit rate for perceptual quality. With RED-VBR, a source specifies its traffic using the recently proposed D-BIND traffic model <ref> [10] </ref>, which captures the property that VBR video has different bounding rates over different interval lengths, and addresses short-term burstiness of the traffic streams. To address long-term bursti-ness, the application renegotiates its traffic parameters and QOS with the network when there is a significant change of long term traffic rate. <p> Delay bounds for priority service disciplines that are more suitable for providing integrated services (e.g., Rate-Controlled Static Priority [14]) may be expressed in a similar manner. It was shown in <ref> [10] </ref> that the D-BIND model combined with the above admission control conditions resulted in considerably higher utilization than that achieved with previous peak-rate-allocation schemes.

Reference-contexts: One of the most important types of traffic served by such networks is Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic with real-time, or bounded delay requirements. An example of such traffic is real-time interactive VBR video. In <ref> [16] </ref>, we introduced a new approach to support real-time VBR video called REnegotiated Deterministic Variable Bit Rate or RED-VBR service. The approach utilizes two important properties of compressed video. First, compressed video traffic usually exhibits burstiness over multiple time-scales [7]. <p> Specifying traffic parameters for live video is a difficult problem that is shared by most of the existing resource allocation schemes. Heuristic off-line and on-line algorithms along with a method for determining D-BIND parameters are described in <ref> [16] </ref>. A third issue with RED-VBR is that it places an additional load on the network's signaling components. Frequent renegotiations by many applications require network nodes to have a high throughput in processing renegotiation messages. Most existing signaling systems have relatively low signaling throughputs. <p> Each stream is transmitted starting with an independent random phase offset j , with j distributed uniformly between 0 and the length of the trace. Once the video source begins transmitting, the segmentation algorithm segments the video according to the off-line or on-line algorithms in <ref> [16] </ref>. Renegotiation requests are then submitted to the network accordingly, and some of these requests may be denied because the deterministic test described in Section 2 fails. When a stream reaches the end of the trace, it wraps around to the beginning. <p> P robfblockg = 0 represents the case of no renegotiation failures, or a D-VBR service. We use the off-line algorithm for segmenting the trace with segmentation parameter = 0:7 for both streams ( controls the frequence of renegotiation <ref> [16] </ref>). This resulted in average renegotiation intervals of 8.4 and 8.7 seconds for the respective streams. There are several noteworthy points about Figures 5 (a) and 5 (b). <p> Figure 6 explores this tradeoff for the off-line segmentation algorithm. As described in <ref> [16] </ref>, increasing the parameter for the off-line algorithm increases the number of segments, thus increasing the renegotiation frequency. For various average renegotiation intervals, the figure shows utilization versus delay bound as in Figure 5. <p> Likewise, with the action movie of Figure 7 (b), the on-line algorithm requires an average renegotiation interval of 3.9 seconds to achieve utilizations similar to those achieved by the off-line algorithm using an average renegotiation interval of 8.7 seconds. While the focus of <ref> [16] </ref> is not to propose the best on-line segmentation algorithm, the experiment of as an off-line algorithm, with smaller, but same order-of-magnitude, average renegotiation intervals. 6 Conclusions The recently-proposed RED-VBR service supports transmission of delay-sensitive VBR video in packet-switched networks based on flexible renegotiation of traffic parameters with graceful degradation of
