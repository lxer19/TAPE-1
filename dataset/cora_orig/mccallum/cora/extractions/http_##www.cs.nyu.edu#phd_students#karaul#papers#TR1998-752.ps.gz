Abstract: With the rapid growth of the World Wide Web, clients attempting to access some popular web sites are experiencing slow response times due to server load and network congestion. Replacing the single server machine with a set of replicated servers is a cost-effective solution to partition server load which also allows incremental scalability and fault transparency. Distributing these replicated servers geographically can reduce network congestion and increase availability. However, distributed web sites are faced with the issue of allocating servers: how do clients find out about the replicas and how do they decide which one to contact? Popular web sites have well publicized server names and require a transparent mapping of the public server name to replicated servers. Unlike most traditional approaches, we propose a technique which pushes the server allocation functionality onto the client. We argue that this approach scales well and results in increased performance in many cases. Building on theoretical work based on game theory, we show that the usage of individual replicas can be effectively controlled with cost functions even when the clients are noncooperative. We present the design and implementation of WebSeAl, our prototype system realizing these techniques. Web-SeAl does not require any changes to existing client and server code, conforms to all standards, and does not generate any control messages. Preliminary experiments utilizing servers on six continents and in controlled settings indicate that WebSeAl improves performance significantly while imposing little overhead. fl This research was sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Rome Laboratory, Air Force Materiel Command, USAF, under agreement number F30602-96-1-0320; by the National Science Foundation under grant number CCR-94-11590; and by the Intel Corporation.

Reference-contexts: Section 3 discusses WebSeAl's architecture and describes how clients strive to minimize delays. Section 4 shows how load balancing can be achieved by introducing cost functions. Experimental results showing WebSeAl's performance are presented in Section 5, and Section 6 provides concluding remarks. 2 Related Work The HTTP redirect <ref> [1] </ref> approach uses the HTTP return code URL Redirection [2] to perform load balancing. A busy server returns the address of another server instead of the actual response, asking the client to resubmit its request to that server. This creates additional network traffic and increased latency.

This creates additional network traffic and increased latency. <p> Upon receipt of a request, each server agent inspects this timestamp and includes the addresses in the response only if more up-to-date address information is available. This is very similar in nature to the If-modified-since header <ref> [2] </ref>, which is used to avoid retrieving cached files which have not been modified since a certain date. HTTP allows application specific header fields and requires that all intermediaries such as proxies or gateways conforming to HTTP ignore these and forward them unchanged.

The name server at the server side is modified to respond to translation requests with the IP numbers of different hosts in a Round-Robin fashion. This results in partitioning client requests among the replicated hosts.

These approaches have the drawback that the routing module represents a single point of failure, and therefore can result in a bottleneck since all requests pass through it. In addition, server side approaches work well only for clustered servers.

Reference-contexts: The interaction among the various distributed controllers (client agents in WebSeAl) can be modeled as a game, and Game Theory provides the systematic framework to study and analyze the behavior of such systems for an overview of game theoretic aspects in computer networking see <ref> [11] </ref> and references therein. The operating points of the system are the Nash equilibria of the underlying control game. Noncooperative equilibria are inherently inefficient: while each controller strives to optimize its individual performance, the overall behavior of the system is, generically, suboptimal.

Reference-contexts: For external client agents accessing the web site, this behavior can be enforced by actual usage-based service charges (for commercial web sites), or by means of limited electronic budget allocated to each clientan architecture developed according to these ideas is proposed in <ref> [12] </ref>. When client agents are sensitive to service costs, the service provider can control not only the load distribution over the available servers, but also the total offered load itself. To support pricing functionalities in WebSeAl, each distributed web site is equipped with a pricing manager module.

That study considers a system of general network resources accessed by a number of noncooperative clients. Each resource is characterized by its capacity, that is, the maximum load that can be accommodated by the resource. <p> One way to determine these factors is to map the parameters of the model considered in <ref> [14] </ref> to the characteristics of WebSeAl and apply the corresponding analytical results, expecting to achieve a good approximation of the desired operating point. Instead, we chose to use an adaptive algorithm, also proposed in [14], which does not depend on the details of the underlying analytical model. <p> One way to determine these factors is to map the parameters of the model considered in <ref> [14] </ref> to the characteristics of WebSeAl and apply the corresponding analytical results, expecting to achieve a good approximation of the desired operating point. Instead, we chose to use an adaptive algorithm, also proposed in [14], which does not depend on the details of the underlying analytical model. The algorithm updates the discount factors iteratively, based on the distance of the current operating point from the desired one. <p> Similarly, if the server receives more load than the desired one, its discount factor is increased. Under a set of general assumptions guaranteeing that the client population as a total reacts rationally to price changes, this iterative scheme was shown in <ref> [14] </ref> to drive the system to the desired operating point. In the current implementation of WebSeAl, server load is expressed in requests per unit of time. Considering HTTP requests, we expect that each client generates a large number of requests, each of small to moderate size.
