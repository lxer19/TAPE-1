Abstract: Exception directed acyclic graphs (EDAGs) are knowledge structures that subsume trees and rules but can be substantially more compact. Manually constructed and induced EDAGs are compared by reconstructing Shapiros structured induction of a chess end game. It is shown that the induced EDAG is very similar to that produced through consultation with experts, and that both are small, comprehensible solutions to a problem that is complex for people.

Reference-contexts: Solution with that of Structured Induction The EDAG of Figure 8 is a relatively simple exposition of the solution to a difficult chess end game situation, and it exemplifies the induction of knowledge as a correct and effectively computable descriptions that can be assimilated and used by a human being <ref> (Quinlan 1991) </ref>. However, it was developed with a mixture of sub-problem structuring by human experts and inductive modeling. It is interesting to investigate whether a similar solution can be developed through inductive modeling without human structuring. from the dataset of 3,196 cases.
