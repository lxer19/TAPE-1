Abstract: We present a new system, called Cirrin, for pen input of ASCII characters using word-level unistrokes. Our system addresses the tradeoff between speed and accuracy of pen-based text entry by substituting precision on the part of the user for ease of recognition on the part of the computer. Cirrin supports ease of recognition by the computer combined with natural, script-like input. This paper discusses the design space of word-level, unistroke input, focusing on the choices made in the circular model of Cirrin that is currently in daily use by the first author.

With most pen-based text entry, the user draws one or more strokes per character <ref> [1, 3] </ref>.

Shorthand writing methods, which reduce the number of strokes written to one per syllable [6] or word [2], are much faster than normal writing or even typing. However, they are difficult to learn and even harder to recognize.

Our intention is to speed up pen-based text entry with word-level gestures that are not only easy for humans to learn but also easy for computers to recognize.

CONCLUSIONS We have presented a word-level unistroke soft keyboard, a new form of pen-based text entry. We have designed one such keyboard and experience shows that it is about as fast as existing pen entry systems <ref> [3] </ref>. Although our system was designed for a user with a repetitive strain injury, it also has applications in situations where a keyboard is too large or bulky to use such as mobile computing.

Reference-contexts: One possible solution would be to use very large text, accessible to peripheral vision. Another possibility is to use audio feedback each time a letter is selected. The system is actually part of a suite of input and output tools (inputlets and outputlets), in use in a DigitalDesk-like environment <ref> [8] </ref>. These include a foot mouse, a keyboard, a software mouse, soft-key buttons, and several circular word-level keyboards with complementary character sets. With this combination, our user often finds herself doing four-limbed input! CONCLUSIONS We have presented a word-level unistroke soft keyboard, a new form of pen-based text entry.
