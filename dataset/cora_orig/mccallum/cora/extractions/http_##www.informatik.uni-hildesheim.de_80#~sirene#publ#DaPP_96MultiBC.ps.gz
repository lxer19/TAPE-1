Reference-contexts: Section 4 shows that these definitions are equivalent except for small transformations of the security parameters. In Section 5, we give a precise definition of multi-bit commitments, present our construction, and prove its security. We show how this and the results of <ref> [20, 5] </ref> directly give a statistical zero-knowledge argument for Boolean circuit satisfiability with small communication complexity. <p> Our commitment scheme allows us to build a statistical zero-knowledge argument for Boolean circuit satisfiability, and so for any NP problem. This can be seen by combining the scheme with two other ingredients: * The protocol by Brassard et al. from <ref> [5] </ref> for showing that a Boolean circuit is satisfiable. This protocol works based on any bit commitment scheme for single bits and is a computational zero-knowledge proof system or a perfect/statistical zero-knowledge argument, depending on whether the commitments used are computationally or unconditionally hiding. <p> This basic step is iterated a number of times. * The method by Kilian et al. from [20] for using a multi-bit commitment scheme in any protocol of a type they call "subset-revealing", of which the protocol from <ref> [5] </ref> is an example. The interesting point is that the method works even though the commitment scheme does not allow opening individual bits in a multi-bit commitment. <p> To simplify, we have followed a number of earlier works in the theorem above and have let all parameters be O (n). Using the protocol from <ref> [5] </ref> based on a 1-bit commitment scheme would give a communication complexity of O (n 3 ) bits. Kilian [18, 19] has found a protocol based on probabilistically checkable proofs that would, with our choice of parameters, have a communication complexity of O (n 2 log n) 1 .

Reference-contexts: Finally, A reveals c 1 , and c 1 c 2 is taken as the common coin that both A and B trust to be random. Commitment protocols are also important in constructing general perfect or statistical zero-knowledge protocols, see [23] or <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> Note that efficient multi-bit commitment schemes can also be used to reduce the communication complexity of zero-knowledge protocols [20]. A concrete example of this for Boolean circuit satisfiability is given later in the paper 3 (see Section 5.3). Unconditionally hiding bit commitment schemes were presented, e.g., in <ref> [6, 4, 8] </ref>. In these schemes, the fact that A cannot later change the bit committed to relies on specific number-theoretic assumptions.

Reference-contexts: We now modify this scheme to get efficient multi-bit commitments. The amortised number of bits of communication 15 per bit committed to is only O (1). Our scheme makes use of families of universal 2 hash functions, defined in <ref> [7] </ref>: Definition 5.2 A class F of functions A ! B, where A and B are finite sets, is called universal 2 if for any distinct a 1 ; a 2 2 A the probability that f (a 1 ) = f (a 2 ) is at most 1=jBj, when f <p> In particular, our construction will be efficient if we use the following functions, essentially from <ref> [7] </ref>.

In comparison, their protocol is perfect zero-knowledge and constant round, but it is based on more specialized assumptions, namely the hardness of computing discrete logarithms in a group of prime order or of factoring integers.

Reference-contexts: In contrast, our scheme is based on any collision-intractable hash function.

Reference-contexts: For an overview of such definitions for encryption schemes and computational relations between them, see [21]. One of these computational definitions is the so-called polynomial security from <ref> [16] </ref>. The adversary has to distinguish between only two possible secret inputs x 0 and x 1 , among which A chooses the actual secret with probability 1=2 each. The adversary may even choose x 0 and x 1 himself, i.e., pick those that seem easiest to distinguish. <p> 0 ] P r [vjx])j: Substituting this into the expression for Bias p gives Bias p X X P r [x]P r [x 0 ] v x x 0 = 2 k+2 : This finishes the proof. ut The second definition of computational secrecy is semantic security, also defined in <ref> [16] </ref>. Here, an arbitrary efficiently computable function f on the message space is given, and the adversary tries to guess f (x) significantly better given his view v than he could have done a priori. For a statistical counterpart, we simply consider all functions f on the message space.

Reference-contexts: When x consists of just one bit, this describes the additional advantage B obtains in guessing the value of x. Thus it is the natural extension of the existing definition of statistically hiding commitment schemes for one bit. Moreover, it coincides with the definition of statistical zero-knowledge in <ref> [17] </ref>. The other definition is based on the difference in Shannon entropy between p and q. Thus it describes how much information about x the adversary can learn from the protocol. <p> Secondly, we consider 4 statistical counterparts of well-known computational secrecy definitions and show that they are also essentially equivalent to our two main definitions. 2 Protocol Notation The model of protocols used in this paper is based on probabilistic interactive Turing machines as defined in <ref> [17] </ref>. These are Turing machines equipped with a read-only input tape, a work tape, a random tape, and two communication tapes. One communication tape is write-only and used for sending messages, and the other is read-only and used for receiving messages. <p> The view of a participant, A, in an execution of an interactive protocol with B is defined to consist of A's input, all random bits used by A, and all the messages sent and received in this execution of the protocol. We refer to <ref> [17] </ref> for detailed definitions. All our protocols have a security parameter k. This means that k in unary representation is a common parameter on the input tapes of both participants. Usually, there are secret inputs, too, i.e., parameters that are on only one of the input tapes. <p> We assume here that the reader is familiar with the concepts of proof systems and zero-knowledge. For formal definitions please refer to <ref> [17] </ref>. An interactive argument is the same as a proof system, except that the soundness property is only required to hold for all polynomial time cheatingprovers. Our commitment scheme allows us to build a statistical zero-knowledge argument for Boolean circuit satisfiability, and so for any NP problem.

Reference-contexts: To simplify, we have followed a number of earlier works in the theorem above and have let all parameters be O (n).

Reference-contexts: Most schemes in the literature are just bit commitment schemes, and thus, if one commits to many bits, each bit is expanded to, e.g., 500 bits.

Reference-contexts: The construction is an improvement of the scheme from [24]. Our construction was presented in preliminary form at Crypto '93. A couple of years later Halevi and Micali, who were apparently unaware of the Crypto '93 result, rediscovered the construction and presented it at Crypto '96. Naor <ref> [22] </ref> has also presented a multi-bit commitment scheme with small amortised communication complexity, based on general assumptions. However, that scheme is of a type dual to ours, i.e., it is only computation-ally hiding, whereas the binding is unconditional.

This scheme needs interaction only in an initialisation phase, after which both committing and opening are non-interactive. We now modify this scheme to get efficient multi-bit commitments. The amortised number of bits of communication 15 per bit committed to is only O (1).
