Abstract: The bandwidth problem is the problem of enumerating the vertices of a given graph G such that the maximum difference between the numbers of adjacent vertices is minimal. The problem has a long history and a number of applications and is known to be NP -hard, Papadimitriou [Pa 76]. There is not much known though on approximation hardness of this problem. In this paper we show, that there are no efficient polynomial time approximation schemes for the bandwidth problem under some plausible assumptions. Furthermore, we show that there are no polynomial time approximation algorithms with an absolute error guarantee of n 1* for any * &gt; 0 unless P = NP . fl Dept. of Computer Science, University of Bonn, 53117 Bonn, and International Computer Science Institute, Berkeley, California.

The class of k-trees is defined recursively as follows: 1. The complete graph on k vertices is a k-tree. 2. <p> Any subgraph of a k-tree is called partial k-tree. P ART IAL-k-T REE is the problem given a graph G and an integer k, decide whether G is a partial k-tree or not. <ref> [ACP 87] </ref> shows that P ART IAL-k-T REE is NP -complete. <p> Thus it is easy to show that the bandwidth problem on everywhere dense graphs is NP-hard. 4 NP-Hardness for Everywhere Dense Cobipartite Graphs We sketch now the proof of NP -hardness of P ART IAL-k-T REE given in <ref> [ACP 87] </ref> to show that the constructed instance is a everywhere dense cobipartite graph. By the results stated in section 3, the N P -hardness of the bandwidth in everywhere dense graphs will follow. Theorem 4.1 ([ACP 87]) P ART IAL-k-T REE is N P -hard.

In particular they prove, that there is no absolute n 1* approximation (for any * &gt; 0) for the treewidth of a graph. <p> But the existence of such algorithms do not imply the existence of P T AS. It is known, that there are no 4=3-approximation algorithms for the edge coloring problem, unless P = N P [Ho 81]. At first we apply the construction of <ref> [BGHK 95] </ref>. Given a graph G = (V; E), we define for a constant k G k = (V k ; E k ) to be the graph with a (k + 1)-clique for each vertex v in G.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The bandwidth problem on graphs has a very long and interesting history cf. <ref> [CCDG 82] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Frieze and Kannan [FK 96] obtained similar bounds for dense instances of some MAXSN P -hard problems using an algorithmic version of Szemeredi's regularity lemma. Another improvement was given by [GGR 96] and [FK 97]. In this paper we relate the parameterized complexity theory <ref> [DF 92] </ref> to the notion of EP T ASs to show, that there are no EP T ASs for the bandwidth problem, under sufficiently strong conditions.

Downey and Fellows <ref> [DF 92] </ref>). Many NP -hard problems become polynomial solvable if we restrict the problems to those, whose instances have constant size k. For the bandwidth problem for example there are O (n k )-time algorithms [Sa 80]. Formally the parameterized problems are defined as follows. <p> Downey and Fellows introduced a new notion of reduction for parameterized problems, the so called parameterized reduction. They introduced for each k 2 IN, a basic parameterized problem s and defined the class W [s] to be the set of problems, which parameterized reduce to s (see <ref> [DF 92] </ref>). This leads to the following parameterized hierarchy. F P T W [1] W [2]::: SP It is believed that each of the inclusions is pure. We say that a problem is W [s]- hard if every problem in W [s] parameterized reduces to it. <p> Each problem which is hard for W [s] for some s 1 is conjectured not to have an algorithm with complexity bound f (k)n O (1) . For most of the W [s] classes are natural complete problem known <ref> [DF 92] </ref>. Under them is interestingly also the bandwidth problem. Theorem 2.4 ([BFH 94]) The bandwidth problem is W [s]-hard for all s 1. This makes it improbable, that there are f (k)n O (1) algorithms for the k-parameterized bandwidth problem.

Reference-contexts: In the best situation one can find approximation algorithms which work in polynomial time and approximate the optimal solutions within an arbitrary given constant. Such (meta-) algorithms are called polynomial time approximation schemes (P T ASs) cf. eg., <ref> [Ho 97] </ref>. Besides a problem instance, they have an additional input, an approximation ratio r. These schemes give us solutions which are r-near to the optimum in time, polynomial in the instance size. There are only few problems for which such schemes exist.

Reference-contexts: The bandwidth B (G) is then B (G) = min f is a numbering of G fB (f; G)g Clearly the bandwidth of G is the greatest bandwidth of its components. The problem of finding the bandwidth of a graph is NP-hard <ref> [Pa 76] </ref>, even for trees with maximum degree 3 [GGJK 78]. The general problem is not known to have any sublinear n * -approximation algorithm (cf. [KWZ 97], [Ka 97]). Smithline [Sm 95] proved that the bandwidth of a complete k-ary tree can be computed in polynomial time.

Reference-contexts: There are only few problems for which such schemes exist. For example the 2 KN AP SACK [IK 75], and BIN P ACKIN G [FL 81], [KK 82], are known to have P T ASs. For the dense instances of problems in M AXSN P <ref> [PY 88] </ref>, the existence of P T AS has been proven by Arora, Karger, Karpinski [AKK 95]. Arora [Ar 96] designed recently a P T AS for the Euclidean traveling salesman problem.

Reference-contexts: Downey and Fellows [DF 92]). Many NP -hard problems become polynomial solvable if we restrict the problems to those, whose instances have constant size k. For the bandwidth problem for example there are O (n k )-time algorithms <ref> [Sa 80] </ref>. Formally the parameterized problems are defined as follows. Definition 2.3 Let A be a subset of fl . The parameterized problem of A is defined as the family fA k g k2IN where A k is the set of instances whose witnesses have size k.

Reference-contexts: An algorithm A is an absolute f (n)-approximation problem for a minimization problem X if for all I 2 X A (I) OP T (I) + f (n): Only a few problems have such algorithms. For example for the edge coloring, we can use Vizing's <ref> [Vi 64] </ref> theorem to construct an absolute 1-approximation algorithm [Ho 81]. But the existence of such algorithms do not imply the existence of P T AS. It is known, that there are no 4=3-approximation algorithms for the edge coloring problem, unless P = N P [Ho 81].
