Reference-contexts: In the case of d (x; z) = (x z) 2 and (t) = I t6=0 , we basically assume a Gaussian likelihood and a special pairwise interaction Markov random field as a prior <ref> (Besag 1986) </ref>. Minimizing (1) is equivalent to maximizing the posteriori. The smoothing parameter controls how much the simplified image is tilted towards the prior. In theory, we now have a sequence of simplified images corresponding to different values of , or different scales. <p> Simulated annealing could be used, and with an appropriate annealing schedule it can find a global minimizer though it is usually very slow. On the other hand, even in the situations where we are able to find a global minimizer more easily, it is argued <ref> (Besag 1986) </ref> that we may still want a local minimizer computed by an algorithm using only local properties of a prior, such as iterative conditional mode algorithm (ICM). This is because of the usually unrealistic global properties of the prior used in (1).

Reference-contexts: Lemma 3. For any patch O in the image z, if jOj jj=2, then the number of its neighboring values N (O) p jOjosc (x) 2 : A boundary segment <ref> (a geometrical curve, in the terms of Koepfler et al. 1994) </ref> is defined as a continuous part of the boundary between any two patches that has no crossing points in the middle, i.e., it does not encounter any other patches except at its two end points. <p> Lemma 4 <ref> (Lemma 3.6 of Koepfler et al. 1994) </ref>. Let ff be the number of patches in an image, and fi the number of boundary segments. Then fi 3ff. Proof of Proposition 2: Let m be the number of patches O such that jOj &gt; 2jj=ff.

Reference-contexts: Another example is the application of satellite images to environmental sampling design, where the task is very often compromised by the complexity and overabundance of information in a typical satellite image <ref> (see Myers, Patil and Taillie 1997) </ref>. These kinds of situations call for an image simplification method. Clearly, what we need is not just reducing the resolution of an image.

Reference-contexts: For example, a main problem in computer vision is that the identification of the main features in a scene may be complicated by the presence of numerous small and secondary details <ref> (see, for example, Romeny, Florack, Koenderink and Viergever 1997) </ref>. Another example is the application of satellite images to environmental sampling design, where the task is very often compromised by the complexity and overabundance of information in a typical satellite image (see Myers, Patil and Taillie 1997).

Reference-contexts: This sequence of simplified images is called a "scale-space" by researchers in computer vision. The most common method to get such a scale-space is diffusion filtering <ref> (see Weickert 1997 and references therein) </ref>. Traditional curve smoothing methods, which basically eliminate high frequency information and keep low frequency information, may also be viewed as simplification methods. Hence, smoothing (or filtering) has naturally been one of the popular tools used in image simplification. <p> Let z be a simplified version of image x obtained by the patchwise updating algorithm of Section 2. The following property is satisfied by many diffusion filtering methods and viewed as important to some applications <ref> (Weickert 1997) </ref>.
