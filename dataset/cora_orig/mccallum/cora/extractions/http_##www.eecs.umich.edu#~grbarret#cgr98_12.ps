Reference-contexts: In Section 5.4 it is shown that, despite the existence of the unique supremal set mentioned above, optimal communication policies are not unique in general.

The organization of this paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces and describes a novel information structure formalism to address decentralized supervisory control problems. Given this general framework, the problem examined in this paper is then formally stated.

Reference-contexts: We will denote the closed-loop language of the plant, G, under control of the set of supervisors, Z, by L (Z=G). The precise manner in which the control signals are combined to affect the plant, e.g., conjunction, disjunction, prioritization <ref> [3] </ref>, etc., is a constraint on the general decentralized control problem and must be stated as an assumption for specific problems.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The decentralized nature of information in many large-scale systems as well as practicality dictate the need for control systems that are also decentralized. Decentralized supervisory control, in the absence of communication, has been well studied in previous work <ref> [4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 17, 21] </ref>, and many classifications of language structure admitting decentralized control without communication exist including co-observability, decomposability and strong decomposability. Control of logical discrete-event systems with communication has been pondered recently in [7, 15, 20, 24].

Reference-contexts: The j; i-th element of C ffi , C j;i ffi , is the set of symbols, ffi j;i , being communicated from Controller j to Controller i. The dynamic configuration of the communication channels as captured in this trajectory model is closely related to mobility in Milner's -calculus <ref> [10, 11] </ref>. When examining a single trajectory, t 2 T , it may be of interest to only consider the event components of that trajectory; hence, define the mapping T : ([C ffi nfin ]) fl ! fl that essentially projects trajectories to their underlying event sequences.

Reference-contexts: Prior work has yet to introduce a framework that is general enough to address certain fundamental questions concerning decentralized supervisory control with communication, for example (paraphrased from <ref> [19] </ref>): (Q1) Who should know what and when? (Q2) Who should communicate with whom? (Q3) When should controllers communicate? (Q4) What should controllers communicate? It is one of the intentions of this paper to present a framework that is general enough to address these questions. <p> The second and fourth items are generally dictated by resources available in the given problem, e.g., memory, processing capabilities, energy available for storage, processing and transmission, etc. The third item refers to the information structure <ref> [19, 22, 23] </ref> of the control system and is now described.
