Reference-contexts: generated by constructing small sample spaces S [0::m 1] n : S induces a distribution on n random variables by choosing a point randomly and uniformly from S: The value of the j th random variable is determined by the j th coordinate of the element in S: 14 In <ref> [1] </ref> constructions for sample spaces that induce (k; fl)-approximations to U n;2 i.e., n identically and uniformly distributed boolean-valued random variables, have been given. <p> = max j2 [1::d] ffl j g: (v) The failure probability p = p (ffi) satisfies p (ffi) 3 2 ffi 2 (vi) The length of the random string R is less than 33t max fln (m j =w) + log log (m j =w)g: Proof: Fix some ffi 2 <ref> [2=( 2); 1] </ref>: For different values of ffi the PET system will only differ only in the number of packets sent. Let B 1 ; : : : ; B d be the blocks of M , and thus the length of B j is m j .

Reference-contexts: the i th bundle cannot be recovered from the first s words is Pr [Z &lt; t]: Exp [Z] = j=1 We want Exp [Z] t and thus (1 + ffi)(1 1=) 1 or, equivalently, ffi 1=( 1): Given that Exp [Z] t we can use Chernoff-bounds (see for example <ref> [2] </ref>) to bound Pr ([Z &lt; t]): Pr [Z &lt; t] Pr [Z Exp [Z] &lt; (ffi (1 1=) 1=)) t] = (ffi (1 1=) 1=) Exp [Z] e 2 (1+ffi)(11=) : To derive a simple upper bound for this expression observe first that for ffi 1 the denominator 2 (1+ffi)(11=)

Reference-contexts: In the networking community encoding systems which allow recovery of the message from only a subset of packets of the encoding have been proposed, for example a system based on Reed-Solomon-code was suggested by [9, McAuley] and empirically evaluated by <ref> [4, Biersack] </ref>. A similar encoding system has been proposed by [10, Rabin]. He uses essentially the same coding techniques that are used in this paper. However, these systems allow only one priority level for the entire message. [11, Shacham] also suggests methods for sending prioritized messages over networks.

Reference-contexts: Using JPEG or MPEG, a discrete cosine transform can be applied to a video image to produce what is hereafter called a message [12, Wallace], <ref> [7, Le Gall] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Thus, for some setting of b, the measure on the encodings should decrease by a factor of at least 2 n=q . 7.1.3 The Relationships Between the Measures The following proof of Lemma 7.2 is a generalization of the proof found in <ref> [8] </ref>. Holder's inequality, which is a generalization of Cauchy Schwartz's inequality, will be needed in this proof. A proof of this inequality can be found in [6].

However, these systems allow only one priority level for the entire message. <ref> [11, Shacham] </ref> also suggests methods for sending prioritized messages over networks. However, those methods require computation of channel capacities from the sender to each receiver, which may be impractical for very large networks with capacities that vary quickly because of congestion. Furthermore, this work does not handle packet losses.
