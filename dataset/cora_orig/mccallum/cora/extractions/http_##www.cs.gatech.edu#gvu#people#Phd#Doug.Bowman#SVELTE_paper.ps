Abstract: We present a framework for the analysis and evaluation of travel, or viewpoint motion control, techniques for use in immersive virtual environments (VEs). The basic construct of this framework is a taxonomy of travel techniques, and we present a summary of three experiments mapping parts of the taxonomy to various performance measures. The complete framework, and the associated system called SVELTE, provide the experimenter with powerful built-in constructs and flexibility. Experiments within the SVELTE system can analyze not only the effects of different travel techniques, but also the effects of many outside factors simultaneously, and multiple performance measurements can be collected. This leads to a deeper understanding of the interaction and the technique(s) in question, as well as to broadly generalizable results. We also present an example experiment within this framework, which measures the users ability to gather information while traveling through a virtual environment. Results indicate that, of the variables tested, the complexity of the environment is by far the most important factor. INTRODUCT ION
