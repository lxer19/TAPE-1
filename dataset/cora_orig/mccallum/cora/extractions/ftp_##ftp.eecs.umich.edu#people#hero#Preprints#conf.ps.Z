Title: Uniform CR Bound: Implementation Issues And Applications  
Author: M. Usman, A.O. Hero and J.A. Fessler 
Affiliation: University of Michigan  
Abstract: We apply a uniform Cramer-Rao (CR) bound [1] to study the bias-variance trade-offs in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image reconstruction. The uniform CR bound is used to specify achievable and unachievable regions in the bias-variance trade-off plane. The image reconstruction algorithms considered in this paper are: 1) Space alternating generalized EM and 2) penalized weighted least-squares.

While the unbiased CR bound (1) is known to be asymptotically achievable for large number of independent identically distributed measurements, in practice, most estima tion algorithms are biased and the unbiased CR bound is inapplicable. III. <p> The application of the biased CR bound (2) is very restricted due to the fact that it is only applicable to estimators with a given bias gradient r b 1 . In <ref> [1] </ref> Hero gives a `uniform' CR bound on the variance of a single parameter 1 for non-singular F Y . <p> This bound is applicable to all biased estimators whose bias gradient length kr b 1 k satisfies: kr b 1 k 2 ffi 2 &lt; 1: (3) The following theorem is proven in <ref> [1] </ref>. Page 1 Theorem 1 Let b 1 be an estimator with bias b 1 () whose n-element bias gradient vector r b 1 satisfies (3). Assume that the FIM F Y is non-singular. <p> Then the variance of b 1 is bounded by: var ( b 1 ) B (; ffi); (4) where B (; ffi) is equal to: B (; ffi) = [e 1 + d min ] T F 1 = 2 e T 1 1 where e 1 = <ref> [1; 0; :::; 0] </ref> T is an n-element unit vector and: d min = [I + F Y ] 1 e 1 ; (7) and is given by the unique non-negative solution of the following equation involving the monotone decreasing, strictly convex function g () 2 [0; 1]: g () = <p> where e 1 = [1; 0; :::; 0] T is an n-element unit vector and: d min = [I + F Y ] 1 e 1 ; (7) and is given by the unique non-negative solution of the following equation involving the monotone decreasing, strictly convex function g () 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>: g () = d T A more general version of Theorem 1, which will not be required here, is given in [5] and applies to singular F Y . <p> A detailed description of the PML-SAGE algorithm is given in [7]. It is easy to show that for the Poisson model r ln f Y (y; ) = A T fi fl where ff is a vector operation denoting element-by-element division, and 1 = <ref> [1; 1; :::; 1] </ref> T . For the first set of simulations the smoothing parameter ff was varied (Figure 4). Points on the curves in Figures 4 are labeled by the exponent of ff.
