Title: On the Spanning Trees of Weighted Graphs  
Author: Ernst W. Mayr C. Greg Plaxton 
Abstract: Given a weighted graph, let W 1 ; W 2 ; W 3 ; : : : denote the increasing sequence of all possible distinct spanning tree weights. Settling a conjecture due to Kano, we prove that every spanning tree of weight W 1 is at most k 1 edge swaps away from some spanning tree of weight W k . Three other conjectures posed by Kano are proven for two special classes of graphs. Finally, we consider the algorithmic complexity of generating a spanning tree of weight W k .

Reference-contexts: The interpolation is the most costly step, and it involves solving a system of W max + 1 equations with O (W 2 max ) digit integer coefficients. This can be done in time polynomial in W max by the result of Edmonds <ref> [Ed] </ref>, who proved that Gaussian elimination with pivoting is in P for exact rational arithmetic.

Reference-contexts: Proof: First compute a 1-MST M . This can be done in O (m + n log n) time using Fibonacci heaps <ref> [FT] </ref>, although for the present argument it would suffice to use one of the simpler 1-MST algorithms with a higher asymptotic running time. Then compute the weight of all spanning trees that are strictly fewer than k edge swaps away from M .

Lawler [La] gave a simple branch-and-bound algorithm for KBST with a running time that is pseudo-polynomial in k. The existence of such an algorithm provides a hopeful sign that a similar result might be possible for KMST. <p> By omitting the word "distinct" from Definition 4.1, we get the definition of the kth best spanning tree problem (KBST). 9 Theorem 5 KMST is NP-hard. Proof: The proof is identical to the one given in <ref> [JK] </ref> for KBST, which is not known to be in NP. The reduction is from HAMILTON CIRCUIT. Note that the O ((mn) k1 ) algorithm described earlier does not solve KMST in time pseudo-polynomial in k.

Reference-contexts: Another interesting class of weighted graphs for which we can prove Conjecture 5 are those with edge weights drawn from an arithmetic sequence of length 3. Weighted graphs of this sort arise in the analysis of LCR networks <ref> [Kaj] </ref>, and Kano was able to prove Conjecture 1 for such graphs. 8 Theorem 4 Let B = (V; P; Q) be a weighted bispanning graph with edge weights drawn from the set fa; a + d; a + 2dg. Then Conjecture 5 holds.

Reference-contexts: If one considers partitioning the spanning trees of a weighted graph into weight classes, a number of natural questions arise with regard to relationships between the classes. In a recent paper, Kano <ref> [Kan] </ref> posed four conjectures that were motivated by the previous work of Kawamoto, Kajitani and Shinoda [KKS]. Our main result is a proof that every minimum spanning tree is at most k 1 edge swaps away from some representative of the kth weight class, settling the first of Kano's conjectures. <p> Such a bispanning graph will be denoted by the triple (V; P; Q). Definition 3.3 A simple bispanning graph is a bispanning graph that contains only cycles of length 2. The following result was obtained previously by Kano using Hall's Theorem <ref> [Kan] </ref>. Here we provide an alternative proof that is explicitly constructive and introduces some of the ideas that will be used to prove Conjecture 1. Theorem 1 Let P be a 1-MST and Q be an arbitrary spanning tree of a given weighted graph G = (V; E).

However, going in the other direction turns out to be much more difficult. Kawamoto, Kajitani and Shinoda <ref> [KKS] </ref> studied 2-MSTs and proved that for every 1-MST P there is a 2-MST Q such that d (P; Q) = 1. This led Kano to pose the following conjecture, for which the result of Kawamoto et al. corresponds to the special case i = 2.

Reference-contexts: Letting A S denote the matrix (a ij ) for i 2 S and j ranging from 1 to n, we have det A T X jSj=n by the Binet-Cauchy formula (see <ref> [Kn] </ref>). Furthermore, det A S = 1; if (V; S) is a tree; 0; otherwise. (3) so that the determinant of A T 0 A 0 is the number of spanning trees of G. This result is due to Okada and Onodera [OO].

Reference-contexts: The validity of each of these statements follows easily from the proof of correctness of Kruskal's greedy algorithm for computing a 1-MST <ref> [Kr] </ref>. Fact 1 A spanning tree is a 1-MST of G if and only if it is a 1-MST in L 1 (G; P ). Fact 2 The unique heaviest edge in some cycle cannot belong to any 1-MST. A heaviest edge in some cycle cannot belong to every 1-MST.

Reference-contexts: Lawler <ref> [La] </ref> gave a simple branch-and-bound algorithm for KBST with a running time that is pseudo-polynomial in k. The existence of such an algorithm provides a hopeful sign that a similar result might be possible for KMST. <p> Interestingly, a pseudo-polynomial time solution is known for KBST; the approach is to generate all spanning trees up to the kth <ref> [La] </ref>. Unfortunately, this method is not powerful enough for KMST since there may be exponentially many spanning trees belonging to classes below the kth. We will now present a determinant-based KMST algorithm for which the running time is pseudo-polynomial in the edge weights as well as k.

Reference-contexts: The existence of such an algorithm provides a hopeful sign that a similar result might be possible for KMST. We do not achieve this goal, but by extending a determinant method due to Okada and Onodera <ref> [OO] </ref>, we obtain an algorithm for which the running time is pseudo-polynomial in the edge weights as well as k. 2 Preliminaries Let G = (V; E) be a connected undirected graph with a real-valued weight w (e) assigned to each edge e 2 E. <p> Furthermore, det A S = 1; if (V; S) is a tree; 0; otherwise.
