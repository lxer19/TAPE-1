Abstract: The polynomial time algorithm of Lenstra, Lenstra, and Lovasz [17] for factoring integer polynomials and variants thereof have been widely used to show that various computational problems in number theory have polynomial time solutions. Among them is the problem of factoring polynomials over algebraic number fields, which is used itself as a major subroutine for several other algorithms. Although a theoretical breakthrough, algorithms based on factorization of polynomials over number fields are notoriously slow and hard to implement, with running times ranging between O(n 12+" ) and O(n 18+" ) depending on which variant of the lattice basis reduction is used. Here, n is an upper bound for the maximum of the degrees and the bit-lengths of the coefficients of the polynomials involved. On the other hand, in many situations one does not need the full power of factorization, so one may ask whether there exist faster algorithms in these cases. In this paper we develop more efficient Monte Carlo algorithms to decide certain properties of roots of integer polynomials, without factoring them. Such problems arise, e.g., when solving systems of algebraic equations. Our methods applied to this situation give thus information about the solutions of such systems of equations. Assuming the validity of the Extended Riemann Hypothesis, our algorithms run in time O(n 6+" ) in worst case, though they usually terminate much faster if the input polynomials do not have the properties the algorithm is testing. Besides this substantial improvement in the running time, our algorithms have the advantage of being conceptually easy. Their building blocks are gcd-computations in polynomial rings over finite fields, and primality tests for integers. However, despite the simplicity

Reference-contexts: Proof. We may suppose that M 6= Q since the number (x) of primes less than or equal to x is lower bounded by x= ln (x) for x 17, see <ref> [1, Th. 8.8.1] </ref>. <p> Hence, Homog (g; p) never returns NO, which means that Normality always returns NORMAL. Suppose that g is not normal. Then the number of "witnesses" p in the interval <ref> [1; k] </ref>, i.e., the number of p unramified in L and not dividing the discriminant of g such that g mod p has an inhomogeneous factorization pattern is at least ff 3 (#W (U )=#G)(k= ln (k)) by Corollary 4. <p> Hence the condition in line (8) is never fulfilled, which means that Normal-Subfield always returns SUBFIELD. Suppose that K 6 M . Then using Corollary 5 and Part (3) of the above proposition, we see that the number of primes p in the interval <ref> [1; k] </ref> which fail the test in line (8) is at least ff 3 k=(2n ln (k)). (Note that k ff 2 (n!m ln (disc (g)disc (h)) ff 1 .) We obtain the assertion on the error probability of our algorithm as in the proof of Theorem 11. <p> Then K is cyclic if and only W 6= ;. Hence, every prime p unramified in K such that Frob K (p) W is a witness for K being cyclic. Proof. Easy (for a lower bound on '(n) see <ref> [1, Th. 8.8.7] </ref>). 2 Algorithm Cyclic (g) is given in Figure 6. We first test whether K is normal.

(See, e.g., <ref> [11, pp. 125-130] </ref>.)

Proof. See <ref> [11, Proposition 2.7] </ref>. 2 We call the list [f 1 ; : : : ; f s ] the decomposition pattern of p in K. We call such a decomposition pattern homogeneous, if f i = f j for 1 i; j s, and call it inhomogeneous otherwise.

Reference-contexts: The basis for our algorithm is the following well-known theorem of M. Bauer (see, e.g. <ref> [20, Cor. 6.8] </ref>): K is a subfield of M if and only if all primes which split a factor of degree one in M do so in K. To apply this theorem, we randomly select primes, and test whether they split a factor of degree one in M . <p> for the structure of the Galois group of a normal irreducible polynomial g, if we know that the group is Abelian?
