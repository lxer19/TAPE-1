Abstract: We consider an extension of the horizontal linear complementarity problem, which we call the extended linear complementarity problem (XLCP). With the aid of a natural bilinear program, we establish various properties of this extended complementarity problem; these include the convexity of the bilinear objective function under a monotonicity assumption, the polyhedrality of the solution set of a monotone XLCP, and an error bound result for a nondegenerate XLCP. We also present a finite, sequential linear programming algorithm for solving the nonmonotone XLCP.

Reference-contexts: Since these assumptions are considerably more general than the column monotonicity property (for one thing, M and N need not be square matrices), the SLP procedure is applicable to a broader class of XLCPs than the (square) monotone class. The XLCP 7 The algorithm described below was formulated in <ref> [1] </ref> and its finite termination was established for bilinear programs, not necessarily convex. We shall rephrase the algorithm for the BLP (M; N; C) and use the convergence results from the reference to establish its finite termination. <p> Hence f (x i ; y i )g has at least one accumulation point (x; y) which must satisfy the minimum principle necessary optimality condition <ref> [1, Theorem A.1] </ref>, and hence the KKT conditions for the BLP (M; N; C). By assumption, it follows that (x; y) solves the XLCP (M; N; C). Consequently, x T y = 0. <p> By assumption, it follows that (x; y) solves the XLCP (M; N; C). Consequently, x T y = 0. By <ref> [1, Theorem A.2] </ref>, a vertex (u i ; v i ) generated by the SLP algorithm solves the BLP (M; N; C) with zero minimum. Hence this vertex also solves the XLCP (M; N; C). 4.1. Sufficient pairs of matrices. <p> In turn, this easily implies that (t x 1 + (1 t )x 2 ) T (t y 1 + (1 t )y 2 ) = 0 The XLCP 9 for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Thus, the convexity of SOL (M; N; q) follows. Conversely, suppose that (M; N ) is not column monotone.

Reference-contexts: In particular, our goal in this paper is twofold: one, to derive some basic results of the HLCP along the line of the classical LCP <ref> [3] </ref>; and two, to present an alternative solution method for the HLCP (particularly, for the "nonmonotone" problems). The problem we shall study in this paper is defined as follows. <p> The latter quadratic program is <ref> [3] </ref> minimize x T (q + M x) subject to x 0; q + M x 0: (1) One important distinction between the BLP (M; N; C) and the quadratic program (1) is that the latter is defined by the variable x only, whereas the former involves the pair (x; y). <p> Let (M; N ) be a monotone product pair of n fi n matrices. If the HLCP (M; N; q) is feasible, then in a finite number of iterations, the SLP algorithm will produce a vertex solution of this HLCP. Inspired by the class of (row/column) sufficient matrices <ref> [3, Section 3.5] </ref>, we can broaden the class of matrix pairs (M; N ) for which the above corollary is valid.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, by the well-known Frank-Wolfe Theorem of quadratic programming <ref> [5] </ref>, the BLP (M; N; C) always has an optimal solution provided that it is feasible.

Reference-contexts: In general, when C = fLz + q : z 2 R ` g for some matrix L 2 R mfi` and vector q 2 R m , the XLCP (M; N; C) becomes the "general linear complementarity problem" studied by Ye [16]. However, Gowda <ref> [6] </ref> pointed out that the XLCP can also be obtained from Ye's general linear complementarity problem, and hence the two are equivalent. <p> On the other hand, the column and row sufficiency defined herein have direct implications for the HLCP. Thus, it is not surprising that these (column/row) sufficiency and monotonicity concepts for matrix pairs would be quite different. The reader is referred to <ref> [6] </ref> for more discussion on these concepts. Acknowledgements. The authors are grateful to Professors M.S. Gowda and Y. Ye for pointing out the connection between the XLCP and Ye's general linear complementarity problem.

Reference-contexts: The polyhedral representations (7) and (8) allow us to obtain some error bounds for the monotone HLCP. (The polyhedrality of (7) follows from Proposition 3.2.) Although some such bounds have been obtained in <ref> [9] </ref> for the general HLCP, they are valid only for test vectors that lie in a compact set. In what follows, we shall use (8) to obtain a sharpened error bound for the nondegenerate, monotone, HLCP. Corollary 3.4.

Reference-contexts: We observe that SOL (M; N; C) is a convex set by (a). Since the BLP (M; N; C) is a quadratic program and the set of optimal The XLCP 5 solutions of any quadratic program is equal to the union of a finite number of convex polyhedra <ref> [10] </ref>, the convexity of SOL (M; N; C) must imply its polyhedrality. Under the assumptions of Theorem 3.1, it is possible to give an explicit (polyhedral) representation for SOL (M; N; C).

We need to assume that M and N are square in order to apply the result in [13] to deduce the positive semidefiniteness of M N T from the column monotonicity of (M; N ). When m = n and C is a singleton, condition (3) is equivalent to the column monotonicity of the pair (M; N ) in the following sense. <p> According to <ref> [13, Theorem 11] </ref>, the column monotonicity of (M; N ) is in turn equivalent to two conditions: (i) M + N is nonsingular, and (ii) M N T is positive semidefinite. <p> A pair of matrices (M; N ) with the property that M N T is positive semidefinite will be called a monotone product pair. Unlike a column monotone pair, a monotone product pair (M; N ) need not contain any nonsingular column representative matrix (as defined in <ref> [13] </ref>). Incidentally, Ye [16] showed that if (M; N ) is a monotone product pair, then his potential reduction algorithm will compute a solution of the XLCP (M; N; C) in polynomial time. <p> It follows immediately from Corollary 4.2 and Theorem 4.3 that if (M; N ) is a row sufficient pair, then the SLP algorithm will compute a solution to the HLCP (M; N; q) for every q for which FEA (M; N; q) 6= ;. In <ref> [13] </ref>, a pair of square matrices (M; N ) was defined to be row monotone if (M T ; N T ) is column monotone. We have previously mentioned that a column monotone pair must be (column and row) sufficient. <p> We have previously mentioned that a column monotone pair must be (column and row) sufficient.

On the other hand, the column and row sufficiency defined herein have direct implications for the HLCP.
