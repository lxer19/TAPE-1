Abstract: An overview of an experimental environment able to support distance learning sessions is presented. In particular the system is capable of carrying out distance learning sessions between two workstations using Netscape graphic user interface and a number of Java applets for handling the control of the system.

Reference-contexts: In this respect, distance learning can be considered an important multimedia service among the various ones which are receiving much attention to-date <ref> [1] </ref>, [2], [3]. In order to support a service of this kind, the telecommunication infrastructure has to efficiently cope with the transmission of different types of streams that have different requirements in terms of constraints and required bandwidth.

This included the design and development of two specially equipped classrooms linked by a dedicated telecommunication channel. No packet switching was involved within such a project. This system is still currently utilized for university classes which are held on a regular schedule.
