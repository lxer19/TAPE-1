Reference-contexts: Much work has been dedicated to the study of the genetic control of behavior using mutations that affect normal activity in a way that allows the identification of genetic determinants and physiological factors <ref> (Bargmann, 1993) </ref>. Despite its small nervous system (only 302 neurons in adult hermaphrodites), the worm shows a variety of behaviors. Much behavior is a coordinate contraction/relaxation of muscles that results in a wavelike movement.

Reference-contexts: When an animal is touched in the head, it moves backward. When it is touched in the tail, it moves forward. Backward/forward movement requires coordination of muscle responses. After repeated stimulation animals show habituation and become refractory <ref> (Chalfie & Sulston, 1981) </ref>. Another habituation phenomenon was observed in C. elegans by Ward (1973) for chemotactic behavior. 4. The touch sensitivity neural circuit 4.1 Some general observations about C. elegans ' nervous system C. elegans ' nervous system is simple. <p> In real animals the ALM neuron is essential for anterior touch sensibility, while the AVM neuron plays only a secondary role. In fact, when ALM neurons are ablated the worm shows reduced anterior sensibility <ref> (Chalfie & Sulston, 1981) </ref>. The same phenomenon is observed for posterior touch sensitivity, with the difference that PVM alone does not mediate any sensibility. In contrast with this, in our simulations the functional roles of the two anterior neurons are equivalent.

Reference-contexts: We give a detailed description of the worm's touch sensitive behavior and of the habituation of this response following repeated stimulation. Also, the neural circuit controlling this behavior is analytically described on the basis of the findings reported by Chalfie and his colleagues <ref> (Chalfie, Sulston, White, Southgate, Thompson & Brenner, 1985) </ref>. In part B we describe a series of simulations of the nematode's touch sensitive behavior. Neural networks that reproduce C. elegans ' neural circuit architecture are evolved using Holland's Genetic Algorithm (Holland, 1975). <p> Through analytical study using laser ablation of single cells, it has been possible to test the role of different interneurons in the neural control of the touch response <ref> (Chalfie et al. , 1985) </ref>. These studies demonstrate that the two AVD cells are essential for motor response (backward movement) to anterior touch stimuli, while the two PVC cells are essential for response (forward movement) to posterior touch stimuli. <p> The two LUA interneurons serve to link the two PLM sensory cells to AVA and AVD interneurons. In fact, only PLMR cell have a direct connection to AVA and AVD. They are considered to function as sensory neurons more than as interneurons <ref> (Chalfie et al. , 1985) </ref>. <p> To study this aspect of the model we analyzed the way our neural networks process input signals and the role of the various neurons in producing the correct motor output. Chalfie's and colleagues <ref> (Chalfie et al. , 1985) </ref> have examined the role of single neurons in the touch sensitivity neural circuit by utilizing the method of laser ablation.

Reference-contexts: Realistic models tend to simulate the nervous system by incorporating as many known details as possible of its structure and function. For example, the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the neuron <ref> (Hodgkin, 1976) </ref> simulates the biochemical functioning of single neurons and, more specifically, action potentials as the result of properties of membrane channels.

Reference-contexts: In part B we describe a series of simulations of the nematode's touch sensitive behavior. Neural networks that reproduce C. elegans ' neural circuit architecture are evolved using Holland's Genetic Algorithm <ref> (Holland, 1975) </ref>. The evolved networks show backward movement in response to stimuli localized in the worm's head region and forward movement in response to stimuli in the tail region. Moreover, the model is able to reproduce the habituation of touch sensitivity, i.e. a decreased response to repeated stimuli.

Reference-contexts: A more detailed model that would allow us to extract more fine data on the neural mechanisms of habituation should probably incorporate lower level mechanisms than those at the neuron level. For example, it should support a system of short-term modification of synaptic strength. In fact, it is known <ref> (Groves & Thompson 1970) </ref> that most of the mechanisms involved in habituation operate at the synaptic level. A more realistic model that incorporates synaptic level details could allow us to study the neural mechanisms of various habituation phenomenon observed in C. elegans (Rankin & Broster, 1992). 9.

Reference-contexts: The results of the MANOVA test confirm that response intensity decreases significantly with p&lt;0.0001 and F 1/19 =416.9 for anterior stimulation, and p&lt;0.001 and F 1/19 =215.9 for posterior stimulation. These results fit well with data reported from experimental work on habituation of touch response in real C. elegans <ref> (Rankin et al. , 1990) </ref>. Similarly good results are obtained in simulations where the stimulus set included 20 or 30 repeated stimuli on each side. The second group of simulations differs from the previous simulations in that the connection signs were not fixed a priori for all neurons.

Conclusions The results presented in this paper constitute the first step toward the validation of a computational model of the real neural circuitry observed in C. elegans . The model accords well to some neurobiological data, even if it needs further refinements and further testing.

Reference-contexts: Chalfie's and colleagues (Chalfie et al. , 1985) have examined the role of single neurons in the touch sensitivity neural circuit by utilizing the method of laser ablation. Using this method <ref> (Sulston & White, 1980) </ref> it is possible to kill by a laser beam a single cell in the alive worm (or to kill the precursor of particular cells during development, determining indirectly the absence of target cells).

Reference-contexts: Many data especially concerning the function of motoneurons have been collected. A table of correspondences between C. elegans motoneurons and Ascaris motoneurons exists, and between motoneuron function and the corresponding chemical transmitters <ref> (Walrond et al. , 1985a) </ref>. In Ascaris, DE1, DE2, DE3, V1, and V2 excitation leads to muscle depolarization and contraction, causing worm movement. The neurotrasmitter released by these neurons is acetylcoline. More analytically, excitation of DE1, DE3, and V1 causes backward movement; excitation of DE2 and V2 causes forward movement.

Reference-contexts: D neurons inhibit controlateral muscles thereby contributing to the generation of a coordinated movement. As a consequence of post-embryonic formation of ventral motor neurons, DD cells are subject to changes in connectivity <ref> (White, Albertson & Anness, 1978) </ref>. 4.3 Connectivity pattern The connectivity pattern of the touch sensitivity circuit is well known (cf. figures 1). <p> In contrast with this, in our simulations the functional roles of the two anterior neurons are equivalent. In fact, AVM neurons by themselves alone mediate a good touch sensitivity, like ALM neurons. And we find the same results for PVM and PLM artificial neurons. It is known <ref> (White et al. , 1978) </ref> that the touch sensitivity circuit is subject, during the worm's life cycle, to reorganization because of postembryonic formation of some sensory and motor neurons. Sensory neurons AVM and PVM arise postembryonically and the presence AVM causes circuitry changes in C. elegans .
