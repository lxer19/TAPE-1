Abstract: This document describes the RC5 encryption algorithm, a fast symmetric block cipher suitable for hardware or software implementations. A novel feature of RC5 is the heavy use of data-dependent rotations. RC5 has a variable word size, a variable number of rounds, and a variable-length secret key. The encryption and decryption algorithms are exceptionally simple.

Reference-contexts: In addition to w and r, RC5 has a variable-length secret cryptographic key, specified by parameters b and K: b The number of bytes in the secret key K. Allowable values of b are 0, 1, ..., 255. K The b-byte secret key: K [0], K <ref> [1] </ref>, ..., K [b 1] . For notational convenience, we designate a particular (parameterized) RC5 algorithm as RC5-w=r=b. For example, RC5-32/16/10 has 32-bit words, 16 rounds, a 10-byte (80-bit) secret key variable, and an expanded key table of 2 (16+1) = 34 words. <p> the body of the loop above) is thus perhaps more analogous to a DES round. 4.2 Decryption The decryption routine is easily derived from the encryption routine. for i = r downto 1 do B = ((B S [2 fl i + 1]) &gt;&gt;&gt; A) A; B = B S <ref> [1] </ref>; 4.3 Key Expansion The key-expansion routine expands the user's secret key K to fill the expanded key array S, so that S resembles an array of t = 2 (r + 1) random binary words determined by K. <p> As noted above, we suggest 12 rounds as a "nominal" choice for RC5-32, and 16 rounds for RC5-64. RC5's data-dependent rotations may help frustrate differential cryptanalysis (Biham/Shamir <ref> [1] </ref>) and linear cryptanalysis (Matsui [3]), since bits are rotated to "random" positions in each round. There is no obvious way in which an RC5 key can be "weak," other than by being too short.

Reference-contexts: Siil for bringing to my attention a cipher due to W. E. Madryga <ref> [2] </ref> that also uses data-dependent rotations, albeit in a rather different manner.)
