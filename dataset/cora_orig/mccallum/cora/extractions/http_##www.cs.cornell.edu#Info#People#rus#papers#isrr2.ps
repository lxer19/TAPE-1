Abstract: In [Don4], we described a manipulation task for cooperating mobile robots that can push large, heavy objects. There, we asked whether explicit local and global communication between the agents can be removed from a family of pushing protocols. In this paper, we answer in the affirmative. We do so by using the general methods of [Don4] analyzing information invariants. We discuss several measures for the information complexity of the task: (a) How much internal state should the robot retain? (b) How many cooperating agents are required, and how much communication between them is necessary? (c) How can the robot change (side-effect) the environment in order to record state or sensory information to perform a task? (d) How much information is provided by sensors? and (e) How much computation is required by the robot? To answer these questions, we develop a notion of information invariants. We develop a technique whereby one sensor can be constructed from others by adding, deleting, and reallocating (a) - (e) among collaborating autonomous agents. We add a resource to (a) - (e) and ask: (f) How much information is provided by the task mechanics? By answering this question, we hope to develop information invariants that explicitly trade-off resource (f) with resources (a) - (e). The protocols we describe here have been implemented in several different forms, and we will show a video reporting on experiments to measure and analyze information invariants using a pair of cooperating mobile robots for manipulation experiments in our laboratory. 1 This paper describes research done in the Robotics

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, the theory is still biased towards sensing, and it remains to develop a framework that treats action and sensing on an equal footing. This paper draws extensively on the material reported in the draft monograph by Donald [Don4], and announced in an abbreviated, preliminary version in <ref> [Don] </ref>. We reported on our ideas on coordinated manipulation strategies in a preliminary form in [DJR]. 1.1.1 Research Agenda Robot builders make claims about robot performance and resource consumption. In general, it is hard to verify these claims and compare the systems. <p> We also give a "hierarchy" of reductions, ordered on power, so that the strength of our transformations can be quantified. Our ideas have the following applications: 2 1 is also called &lt; s in <ref> [Don, Don4] </ref>. 3 For example: no algorithm exists to decide the existence of a linear-space (or log-space, polynomial time, Turing-computable, etc.) reduction between two CT problems. 1. (Comparison). <p> the difference G G 0 of G and G 0 as follows: G + G 0 = (V V 0 ; E E 0 ): Def. 3.7 may also be lifted to (partially) immersed graphs, and hence to situated sensor systems. 3.5 Reductions, Calibration, and Codesignation As we observed in <ref> [Don] </ref>, calibration exploits external state. We wish to order systems on how much information this external state (from calibration) yields, to obtain def. 3.8, below. Calibration complexity is defined formally in [Don4]. Here is the basic idea. <p> In any case, the bandwidths of Protocols I (QS) and II are log x and log (resp.) Since 2r tan (t) = (t), we argue that these two systems have the same maximum bandwidth. 3.5.2 Reductions using Communication In light of this discussion, we now define the reduction 1 from <ref> [Don] </ref>, using relativized information complexity. Recall the construction of comm () as a sensor system (sec. 3.2). First, let S be a monotonic sensor system with output z. In this case, we define comm (S) to be comm (z). <p> We say such a hierarchy collapses if it is isomorphic to an elementary relation. In particular, the hierarchy of k-wire reductions (k &gt; 0) collapses if 1 is elementary transitive [Don4]. 8 1 is also called &lt; s in <ref> [Don, Don4] </ref>. Page 13 4 Comparing Protocols Using Reductions We now apply the ideas above to compare our protocols, P.I (QS) and P.II (the circuits in figs. 8-10). First, we define two black boxes (see sec. 3.5.1).

Reference-contexts: This paper uses the theoretical framework introduced by Donald in [Don,Don4]. A central theme to previous work (see the survey article <ref> [Don1] </ref> for a detailed review) has been to determine what information is required to solve a task, and to direct a robot's actions to acquire that information to solve it.

What information is needed by a particular robot to accomplish a particular task? 2. <p> In addition to the work discussed here in sec. 1, for a detailed bibliographic essay on previous research on the geometric theory of planning under uncertainty, see, eg., <ref> [Don1] </ref> or [Don3].

Reference-contexts: Of course, our protocols rely on a number of assumptions in order to work. We develop a framework for analysis and synthesis, based on information invariants <ref> [Don4] </ref>, to reveal these assumptions and expose the information structure of the task. We believe our theory has implications for the parallelization of manipulation tasks on spatially distributed teams of cooperating robots. To develop a parallel manipulation strategy, first we start with a perfectly synchronous protocol. <p> Horswill [Hors] has developed a semantics for sensory systems that models and quantifies the kinds of assumptions a sensori-computational program makes about its environment. He also gives source-to-source transformations on sensori-computational "circuits." The paper <ref> [Don4] </ref> discusses the semantics of sensor systems. This formalism is used to explore some properties of what we call situated sensor systems. [Don4] describes a way to transform sensori-computational systems. <p> He also gives source-to-source transformations on sensori-computational "circuits." The paper <ref> [Don4] </ref> discusses the semantics of sensor systems. This formalism is used to explore some properties of what we call situated sensor systems. [Don4] describes a way to transform sensori-computational systems. When one can be transformed into another, we say the former can be "reduced" to the latter, and we call the transformation a "reduction." We also derive algebraic algorithms for reducing one sensor to another. <p> It is very difficult to analyze the interaction of sensing, computation, communication (a - e) and mechanics (f) in distributed manipulation tasks. The analyses of <ref> [Don4] </ref> focus on (a - e), and each analysis is "parameterized" by the task. This paper represents an attempt to integrate a measure of the "information content of the task mechanics" (f) into the theory. <p> Nevertheless, the theory is still biased towards sensing, and it remains to develop a framework that treats action and sensing on an equal footing. This paper draws extensively on the material reported in the draft monograph by Donald <ref> [Don4] </ref>, and announced in an abbreviated, preliminary version in [Don]. We reported on our ideas on coordinated manipulation strategies in a preliminary form in [DJR]. 1.1.1 Research Agenda Robot builders make claims about robot performance and resource consumption. <p> We then ask, is there a general theory quantifying the power gained in such trade-offs? In sec. 3, we present a theory, which represents a systematic attempt to make such comparisons Page 3 based on geometric and physical reasoning. In <ref> [Don4] </ref>, we operationalize our analysis by making it computational; we give effective (albeit theoretical) procedures for computing our comparisons. See sec. 5 for a summary. We wish to rigorously compare embedded sensori-computational systems. <p> We also give a "hierarchy" of reductions, ordered on power, so that the strength of our transformations can be quantified. Our ideas have the following applications: 2 1 is also called &lt; s in <ref> [Don, Don4] </ref>. 3 For example: no algorithm exists to decide the existence of a linear-space (or log-space, polynomial time, Turing-computable, etc.) reduction between two CT problems. 1. (Comparison). <p> We foreground the task of pushing an object, using two communicating robots who need to infer the position of the first moment of the friction distribution with respect to their lines of pushing (see Figure 2a). In <ref> [Don4] </ref>, we asked whether explicit communication could be removed from this protocol (by "explicit" we mean local communication, such as IR, or global communication, such as RF). <p> In this paper we give a protocol with no explicit communication, and we analyze and compare the the protocols using the tools intro duced in <ref> [Don4] </ref>. <p> We do so below. 3 Reductions and Transformations We now formalize our model of sensori-computational systems by viewing them as "circuits." The theory in secs. 3-6 is extracted from <ref> [Don4] </ref>, but the particular examples and application (especially, claim 4.1) are new. We model these circuits as graphs. Vertices correspond to different sensori-computational components of the system (what we will call "resources" below). Edges correspond to "data paths" through which information passes. <p> Def. 3.4 can be generalized to any number of "unbound" vertices; see eq. (8) and <ref> [Don4] </ref>. 3.3 Permutation We may consider two orthogonal kinds of permutation. In both models, the vertex and edge labels `(v) and `(e) never change. The first model is called vertex permutation, and is given in def. 3.5. <p> Hence, in class edge permutation, we permute edges within a type (or class). In this paper we will restrict our edge permutations to this kind of class edge permutation. Class edge permutation leaves unchanged the complexity bounds and the lemmas of <ref> [Don4] </ref>. To summarize: vertex permutation preserves the graph topology whereas edge permutation can move the edges around. Edge permutation permits arbitrary rewiring (using existing edges). It cannot add new edges, nor can it change their bandwidth. <p> We wish to order systems on how much information this external state (from calibration) yields, to obtain def. 3.8, below. Calibration complexity is defined formally in <ref> [Don4] </ref>. Here is the basic idea. Calibration complexity measures how much information we add to a sensor system when we install and calibrate it. Installing a sensor system may require physically establishing some spatial relation between two components of the system. <p> For example, the odometry system odom and the -source system in sec. 4 are black boxes. More generally, we call a sensor system monotonic if its internal bandwidth is bounded above by its raw output size. So, black box sensors are trivially monotonic. All the sensor systems in <ref> [Don4] </ref> are monotonic. If we believe that the output size of our protocols is O (log p) bits, then our sensor systems are also monotonic. If we believe the output size is 2 bits, they are not. <p> We say Q is efficiently reducible to S if S fl Q + comm (S): (2) In this case we write 8 S 1 Q. Now, permutation (the fl operation) and combination (the + operation) "commute" for compatible partial immersions. This is formalized as a "distributive" property in <ref> [Don4] </ref>. So, for example, for any sensor system S, we have ensured that S fl + comm () = (S + comm ()) fl , i.e., we can do the permutation and combination in any order. Second we have ensured that the combination operation + is commutative and associative. <p> Let us summarize. The reduction 1 (def. 3.11) is a "1-wire" reduction. It does not appear to be transitive. The reduction fl (def. 3.9) is a "0-wire" reduction. It is transitive for simple sensor systems <ref> [Don4] </ref>. We could analogously define a 2-wire, or more generally, any k-wire reduction k by modifying eq. (2) in def. 3.11 to S fl Q + k comm (S); (2 0 ) where k comm (S) denotes k times z -| - comm (S) + + comm (S). <p> The k-wire reductions f i g i2N form a graded relation. Even though we believe that 1 is not transitive (in the elementary sense), the hierarchy has graded transitivity on simple sensor systems <ref> [Don4] </ref>. This means that for any simple sensor systems S, Q, and U , if S i Q and Q j U , then S i+j U . This follows from a lemma that the 0-wire reduction 0 (called fl in def. 3.9) is elementary transitive for simple sensor systems. <p> Consider the hierarchy of k-wire reductions f i g i2N . We say such a hierarchy collapses if it is isomorphic to an elementary relation. In particular, the hierarchy of k-wire reductions (k &gt; 0) collapses if 1 is elementary transitive <ref> [Don4] </ref>. 8 1 is also called &lt; s in [Don, Don4]. Page 13 4 Comparing Protocols Using Reductions We now apply the ideas above to compare our protocols, P.I (QS) and P.II (the circuits in figs. 8-10). First, we define two black boxes (see sec. 3.5.1). <p> We say such a hierarchy collapses if it is isomorphic to an elementary relation. In particular, the hierarchy of k-wire reductions (k &gt; 0) collapses if 1 is elementary transitive [Don4]. 8 1 is also called &lt; s in <ref> [Don, Don4] </ref>. Page 13 4 Comparing Protocols Using Reductions We now apply the ideas above to compare our protocols, P.I (QS) and P.II (the circuits in figs. 8-10). First, we define two black boxes (see sec. 3.5.1). <p> It is somewhat surprising that we can in fact automate this process: <ref> [Don4] </ref> gives algorithms for deciding the relation 1 . More precisely, given suitable encodings of two sensor systems S and U , we can computa-tionally decide whether S 1 U [Don4]. The algorithm is too complicated to describe here. <p> It is somewhat surprising that we can in fact automate this process: <ref> [Don4] </ref> gives algorithms for deciding the relation 1 . More precisely, given suitable encodings of two sensor systems S and U , we can computa-tionally decide whether S 1 U [Don4]. The algorithm is too complicated to describe here. We examine a special case to give a flavor for it; many details are omitted. The basic idea involves employing the theory of real closed fields with bounded quantification. <p> We will model (algebraic) codesignation constraints as a (possibly constant) semi-algebraic (s.a.) mapping 7! D ( ) taking an immersion to a s.a. set D ( ) C d . All these methods generalize to graph permutation as well <ref> [Don4] </ref>. Now, Definition 5.1 A simulation function U for U is a map U : C d ! R, where R the space of outputs. We call the Page 14 value U () 2 R of U on a sensor configuration to be the sensor value at . <p> This is because data does not not feed back into the system. 10 We must also be able to compute dominance in calibration complexity (see def. 3.8). This can be done independently, and much faster than eq. (8) can be decided; see <ref> [Don4] </ref>. Here, D S () models the codesignation constraints; they require the choice of extension fl by the inner quantifier to depend on the extension selected by the middle quantifier. <p> Recall the definition of compatibility for partial immersions (sec. 3.4). We first observe that permutation (the fl operation) and combination (the + operation) "commute" for compatible partial immersions <ref> [Don4] </ref>. Our arguments above for guessing extensions and permutations can be generalized mutatis mutandis to compute the combination (def. 3.6) of two algebraic sensor systems. <p> Note that for "small" sensor systems, eq. (9) becomes d : (10) Although complex, eq. (8) is simplified for presentation. The full Tarski sentence also contains codesigna-tion constraints for the outer quantifiers, and is given in <ref> [Don4] </ref>. We must warn that in sec. 5 we have examined a special case, where S and U are partially situated (that is, the domains of and are non-empty). A powerful generalization is given in app. A, where the sensor systems can be unsituated. <p> Question (ii) sheds light on whether we can cheaply and cleverly reencode a sensor system so as to gain a lot of "power" (information complexity). <ref> [Don4] </ref> first derives the complexity bounds in lemma 5.3 and eq. (9-10) for vertex permutation. Next, [Don4] asks: how expensive it is to compute the reductions fl and 1 using graph permutation? By extending the configuration space C d to include all possible edge permutations, we obtain an extended configuration space <p> Question (ii) sheds light on whether we can cheaply and cleverly reencode a sensor system so as to gain a lot of "power" (information complexity). <ref> [Don4] </ref> first derives the complexity bounds in lemma 5.3 and eq.

We show: Lemma 6.1 (The Clone Lemma) Graph permutation can be simulated using vertex permutation, preceded by a linear time and linear space transformation of the sensor system. <p> Reorientation Task Task Protocol O global coordination 4 1 and control Protocol I (QS) local IR comm, 4 2 partial synchrony, MIMD Protocol II uniform, 4 3 asynchronous We believe that a methodology for developing coordinated manipulation protocols is emerging, based on the tools described in this paper, [DJR], and <ref> [Don4] </ref>: Over =) 12 Hint: the easiest way to compose the control loops, is to first add two bits of explicit communication. A one-bit L ! R datapath tells R when L has broken contact. A symmetric L R datapath tells L when R breaks contact. <p> Appendix A What is Permutation? In sec. 5 we examined a special case, where S and U are partially situated (that is, the domains of and are non-empty). A powerful generalization is given in <ref> [Don4] </ref>, where the sensor systems can be unsituated. Using the ideas in sec. 5, we can give an "abstract" version of permutation that is applicable to partially immersed sensor systems with codesignation constraints. Each set of codesig-nation constraints defines a different arrangement in the space of all immersions. <p> This region constraints the necessary coplacements fl 0 of U relative to (S; 0 ). Perhaps surprisingly, allowing unsituated permutation does not change the complexity bounds of sec. 5 <ref> [Don4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: His theory is set in a logical framework where sensors are logical predicates. Perhaps our theory could be viewed as a geometric attack on a similar problem. This work was motivated by the theoretical attack on perceptual equivalence begun by <ref> [DJ] </ref> and by the experimental studies of [JR]. Horswill [Hors] has developed a semantics for sensory systems that models and quantifies the kinds of assumptions a sensori-computational program makes about its environment. He also gives source-to-source transformations on sensori-computational "circuits." The paper [Don4] discusses the semantics of sensor systems. <p> Such a sensor looks at a visual field and outputs one bit, returning #t if the visual field contains a grandmother and #f if it doesn't. Now, one view of the sensor interpretation problem is that of information reduction and identification (compare <ref> [DJ] </ref>, which discusses hierarchies of sensor information). However consider a somewhat different perspective, that views sensors as model matchers. <p> For example, can robots "externalize," or record state in the world? The answer depends not only on the environment, but also upon the dynamics. A juggling robot probably cannot. On a conveyor belt, it may be possible (suppose 14 We use the term in the sense of <ref> [DJ] </ref>; others, particularly Hendersen have used similar concepts. "bad" parts are reoriented so that they may be removed later). However, it is certainly possible during quasi-static manipulation by a single agent.

We denote them by 4 1 ,4 2 , etc. For these protocols, we started with the offline algorithm 4 1 of [Rus], which was designed for multi-fingered robot hands with global coordination.

Reference-contexts: The boxes are typically several robot diameters wide, and 1-2 times the mass of a single robot, although the robots have also pushed couches that are heavier (perhaps 2-4 times the mass, and 8 fi 3 robot diameters in size).

Reference-contexts: Fourth, our protocols assume neither that the robot has a geometric model of the box, nor that the first moment of the center of friction is known. Instead, the robot combines sensorimotor experiments and manipulation strategies to infer the necessary information (the experiments have the flavor of <ref> [JR] </ref>). Finally, the pushing literature generally regards the "pushers" as moving kinematic constraints. In our case, because (i) there are at least two robot pushers and (ii) the robots are less massive than the box, the robots are really "force-appliers" in a system with significant friction. <p> His theory is set in a logical framework where sensors are logical predicates.

The paper [Don4] discusses the semantics of sensor systems. <p> When transmitting or receiving, each modem essentially functions like the remote control for home appliances (e.g., televisions). In addition, each robot has a ring of one-bit contact ("bump") sensors. We assume the following: (1) robots can sense the relative orientation of objects with which they are in contact <ref> [JR] </ref>; (2) robots know that they are on the same flat face of the object; (3) both robots know the direction of pushing, p; and (4) robots can synchronize their velocities. 4 In addition, (5) by examining the servo-loop 4 For the pushing task, it suffices to assume that the robots <p> Moreover, we observe that the tangent function is monotonic and sign preserving; this means we can adapt the control system to servo on instead of , without knowing r. Specifically, the robots measure 0 (the initial angle between n and p; see <ref> [JR] </ref>), and compare this value to the angle (t) measured at time t in order to infer the direction of motion of the box. A negative change in the value of this angle implies a clockwise rotation of the box. A large positive change implies a counterclockwise rotation. <p> The output vertex of the sensor system is where the output of the sensor is measured. One interesting resource is (t) in fig. 12|we call this box a -source|it produces a signal indicating relative orientation. <ref> [JR] </ref> describe in detail how to implement a bounded-error -source. Here is the basic idea. A -source is an abstraction of relative normal sensing. It allows the normal of the box to be treated as an external "register" that both robots may read and write. <p> It allows the normal of the box to be treated as an external "register" that both robots may read and write. We could implement an (approximate) -source as follows. The robot has a ring of 1-bit bump sensors. These are used to implement relative normal sensing <ref> [JR] </ref>. We specify the pushing direction p, by specifying 0 (see fig. 10), the direction of p relative to the box normal n (0) at time 0. More specifically: at the beginning of the task, each robot does a guarded move along p until contact with the box. <p> More specifically: at the beginning of the task, each robot does a guarded move along p until contact with the box. It then aligns normal to the box, using the bounded-error algorithm of <ref> [JR] </ref>. Finally, the robot turns by angle 0 using pure position control. init is one bit of state, and run= init. The small crossed circles () that these bits run into are gates; the # input must be 1 for the $ signal to pass. <p> In describing Protocol II, we demonstrated that one implementation of such a sensor involves using some retained state ( 0 ), and a relative orientation sensor such as the bumper system described in <ref> [JR] </ref>. In fact, equation (3) is a precise statement of this engineering fact. Below, we carefully define the operators + and , and formalize the notions of simulation and efficient reduction, as well as permutation, etc. Our reduction involves two concepts. <p> However, a careful analysis then shows that even these two bits of (explicit) communication can be removed. 13 In particular, we have considerably improved the protocol 4 3 from [DJR].

Reference-contexts: The robot consists of two rigidly connected fingers L and R; for example, they could be the fingers of a parallel-jaw gripper. One complication involves the micro-mechanical variations in the slip of the box on the table <ref> [Mas] </ref>. This phenomenon is very hard to model, and hence it is difficult to predict the results of a one-fingered push; we will only obtain a straight-line trajectory when the center of friction (COF) lies on the line of pushing.

Reference-contexts: In our case, because (i) there are at least two robot pushers and (ii) the robots are less massive than the box, the robots are really "force-appliers" in a system with significant friction. In this sense, our task is in some ways closer in flavor to dynamic manipulation <ref> [ML] </ref>, even though the box dynamics are essentially quasi-static. Of course, our protocols rely on a number of assumptions in order to work. We develop a framework for analysis and synthesis, based on information invariants [Don4], to reveal these assumptions and expose the information structure of the task.
