Abstract: A truncated cone, made of material of uniform resistivity, is given in many introductory physics texts as a nontrivial problem in the computation of resistance. The intented method and answer are incorrect and the problem cannot be solved by elementary means. In this paper, we (i) discuss the physics of current flow in a nonconstant cross section conductor, (i) examine the flaws in the "standard" solution for the truncated cone, (iii) present a computed resistance found from a numerically generated solution for the electrical potential in the truncated conse, and (iv) consider whether any problem exists to which the standard solution applies. Many (most?) texts[1] for calculus-based courses try to introduce an application of calculus by including a problem in which a resistor has a nonconstant cross-section. In these books (usually in chapter 262) the student is asked to find the resistance of a truncated cone, as in Fig. 1. The method that is intended can be inferred from the answer. (In the text by Wolfson and Pasachoff[1] the student is explicity instructed to use this method.) The student is meant to break the cone into isolated differential slabs of resistance (each could be called a piece de resistance). The slab at location x would have differential thickness dx, and would have a resistance dR = dx=(r 2 ), where r is the radius of the cone's cross-section at x. Since dx=dr = L=(b a) we have dR = L ba This seems plausible at first the role of A in (1) is played in (2) by the geometric mean of the area of the disks bounding the cone but the plausibility does not stand up to a close second look. When the slabs are added "in series," it is required that their planar faces be equipotentials. The stack of slabs is eletrically equivalent to the cone only if the equipotentials in the current-carrying cone consist of planes perpendicular to the axis, as is shown in Fig. 2. This is impossible. If these were the equipotentials then the electrical fields (orthogonal to the equipotentials) would be parallel to the axis, as shown in the figure. The current (parallel to the electric field in an Ohmic conductor) would then also be parallel to the cone axis, and therefore not parallel to the curved sides of the resistor. This would imply that current is flowing in through the sides! The actual equipotentials, therefore, must be curved in order to be perpendicular to the sides of the resistor. A few of the texts suggests some sort of approximation is being made (about which more below); only Wolfson and Pasachoff (see Ref.[1]) point out that the assumption of the planar equipotentials is being made, and that the assumption is wrong.
