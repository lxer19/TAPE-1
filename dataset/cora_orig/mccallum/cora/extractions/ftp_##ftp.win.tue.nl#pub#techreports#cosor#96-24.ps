Abstract: We show the combinatorics behind the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney two-sample test. This yields new combinatorial proofs of recurrences for its null distribution given recently by Brus and Chang, as well as new recurrences. It is shown how to convert these recurrences into generating functions. These generating functions are used to obtain closed expressions for the null distribution when one of the sample sizes is fixed and to compute moments. We also show how to perform these calculations with the aid of the computer algebra system Mathematica.

Reference-contexts: In combinatorial terminology, f (m; n; k) is nothing but the number of partitions of k with at most m non-zero blocks of maximal size n (see <ref> [1] </ref> or [6]) 2 . This connection was already noted by Wilcoxon himself, but is hardly used in the statistical literature. The favourite tool of in combinatorics for studying partitions is the Ferrers diagram (see [1] and [6]).

This connection was already noted by Wilcoxon himself, but is hardly used in the statistical literature. The favourite tool of in combinatorics for studying partitions is the Ferrers diagram (see [1] and [6]). This is a graphical way to represent a partition (see example below). Its statistical counterpart is known in nonparametric statistics as the Gnedenko path (other names are pair chart or PP-plot, see e.g. [11]). <p> Since this map is an area preserving bijection from the set of Gnedenko paths from (0; 0) to (m; n) to the set of Gnedenko paths from (0; 0) to (n; m), the result follows. 2 The partition analogue of this proof is to consider the conjugate partition (cf. <ref> [1, Theorem 1.5] </ref>). As an immediate corollary we obtain the mean of the statistic M m;n . Corollary 2.3 Under H 0 : F = G, we have E M m;n = mn . <p> Their importance is growing due to availability of computer algebra systems. Let us look at the generating function of f (m; n; k) with respect to k. This generating function goes back to Gauss (see <ref> [1, p. 51] </ref>) and was rediscovered in the context of lattice path counting by Polya (see [10]). <p> (1 q) (1 q 2 ) : : : (1 q n ). 4 Note that there is no analogue of Theorem 2.8, because there is only one partition of r such that the size of the largest block equals r. 3 MOMENTS OF THE MANN-WHITNEY STATISTIC 9 Proof: See <ref> [1, Chapter 3] </ref> for a proof based on recurrences or [2, Chapter 11, pp. 203-204] for a proof based on inversions. 2 The number fi n fl q is called Gaussian binomial coefficient. <p> It is a generalization of the ordinary binomial coefficient, since if q tends to 1, then the limit is the ordinary binomial coefficient (see e.g., <ref> [1, Theorem 3.2] </ref>). Note that the Gaussian binomial coefficient is a polynomial in q of degree mn, since k mn. <p> The proof is now completed by applying Proposition 2.1. 2 A closer look at (22) reveals that M 2;n can be decomposed as a sum of two independent uniform random variables, viz.

In a similar way we may try to prove that M 3;n is the sum of three independent uniform random variables.
