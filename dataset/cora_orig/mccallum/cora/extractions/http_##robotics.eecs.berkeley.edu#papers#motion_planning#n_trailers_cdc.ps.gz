Abstract: In this paper, we show how the machinery of exterior differential systems can be used to help solve nonholonomic motion planning problems. Since the Goursat normal form for exterior differential systems is dual to chained form for vector fields, we solve the problem of steering a mobile robot with n trailers by converting the system into chained form, doing the path-planning in the chained form coordinates, and converting the path back into the original coordinates. Simulations of the N -trailer system parallel parking and backing into a loading dock are included.

It can be summarized in the following algorithm for converting a system into Goursat form (see [7] for the feedback linearization version of this algorithm, on which this is based).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper, we consider and solve the motion planning problem for a car-like mobile robot pulling n trailers. This system has been an important canonical example for the work on nonholonomic motion planning ever since it was posed in <ref> [10, 16] </ref>, because each trailer adds one dimension to the state space of the system (representing its angle with respect to the inertial frame) and one nonholonomic constraint. <p> Regardless of the number of trailers attached, the general system always has two degrees of freedom, corresponding to driving and steering for the front car. It has been shown that every point in the state space is reachable, i.e. that the system is completely controllable <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We show in Section 3 that this system can be converted into Goursat's normal form or equivalently chained form. Section 4 is devoted to presenting methods for steering systems in chained form. Three different methods are presented using as inputs sinusoids, piecewise constant inputs (as in <ref> [14] </ref>) and polynomials. <p> Parallel-parking type maneuvers seem particularly well-suited to sinusoidal steering methods.. 4.2 Piecewise Constant Inputs The second method we investigate for steering chained form systems uses piecewise constant inputs. This method was originally proposed by Monaco and Normand-Cyrot <ref> [14] </ref>, and was inspired by multirate digital control. It is most easily understood in the context of nonholonomic motion planning simply as piecewise constant inputs.

The question that is answered in this paper is one of constructive controllability; explicit open loop controls for steering the car with n trailers from an initial to a final position are given. <p> We present three methods to steer the chained form system. 4.1 Sinusoidal inputs The first steering method that we consider uses sinusoidal inputs. Steering chained form systems with sinusoids was originally proposed by us in <ref> [17] </ref>. The method that we have developed here is different from the original algorithm in that it steers all the states in one step, instead of one state at a time. <p> (t) = ff sin !t u 2 (t) = fi cos k!t applied over one period T = 2=!, will result in a net motion, z i (T ) = z i (0) i = 1; : : : ; k + 1 ff k fi The steering algorithm in <ref> [17] </ref> is step-by-step: It first steers z 1 ; z 2 to their final position using constant inputs, disregarding the other states. Then it steers z 3 to its desired final position using sinusoids, z 1 ; z 2 will return to their final values. <p> In addition, there are nonholonomic systems whose constraints fail to meet the conditions of the Goursat normal form, for example, the system modeling a circular finger tip rolling on a planar face <ref> [17] </ref>. The problem of steering such systems remains an open one. Acknowledgements We would like to thank several people who have helped us in understanding this problem over the past few years: R.

Reference-contexts: Transformation 2: Coordinates of the origin seen from the last trailer Yet another choice for f 1 corresponds to writing the coordinates of the origin as seen from the last trailer. This is reminiscent of a transformation used by Samson <ref> [19] </ref> in a different context, and is given by z 1 := f 1 (x) = x n cos n + y n sin n : This has the physical interpretation of being the origin of the reference frame when viewed from a coordinate frame attached to the n th trailer.

Reference-contexts: Thus f 1 may be chosen to be any function of x n ; y n ; n exclusively. We now proceed to explain two different solutions of the equations (2): Transformation 1: Coordinates of the N th trailer In a choice motivated by Strdalen <ref> [20] </ref> we choose f 1 = x n . Then, the second equation of (2) becomes sin n dx n ^ dy n ^ df 2 = 0 with the proviso that df 1 ^df 2 6= 0. <p> These two are exactly the same as those discussed in the previous subsection in the context of the Goursat normal form. Transformation 1 Originally proposed by Strdalen <ref> [20] </ref>, and also used in the previous section, is as follows: z 1 = x n The corresponding input transformation is: u 1 = _z 1 = cos n v n = cos ( 0 1 ) cos ( 1 2 ) cos ( n1 n ) cos n v 0
