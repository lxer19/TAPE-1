Reference-contexts: The use case development is based on the standard architecture described by the Logical Network Reference Model (LNRM). A quantitative description of how users employ the system is realized with operational profiles. A method for developing operational profiles was proposed by John D. Musa <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]. Testing of mobile telephony functionality can be performed with statistical use testing, using the Markov chain model as a statistical model [9], [10]. 1.1.

Project results Several results issued from the project. A method for developing operational profiles at network and node level was developed. For simplicity, and in order to provide a concrete example, the method was applied to MO SMS. <p> Operational profiles An operational profile is a quantitative characterization of how users employ a system <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]. A prioritized development approach is potentially a very competitive, customer oriented way to sequence new product introduction: make the most used features available very quickly and provide less used features in subsequent releases. Operational profiles are essential in software reliability engineering (SRE).

Reference-contexts: Through the MO SMS, the pilot introduced the use case design at the level of requirement and implementation design. The Logical Reference Network Model for the North American Standard was introduced for the pilot. The following results from the TRACE pilot were used in this project: - LNRM model <ref> [6] </ref> - MO SMS network use cases [7] - MO SMS VLR node use cases [8] Also, the project was based on an existing method for developing operational pro files, proposed and used by John D. Musa [1], [2]. 1.4. Project results Several results issued from the project. <p> Also, it improved the existing VLR node use case design by splitting the VLR node use case in three node use cases. A simplified case study was developed as a concrete example, at node and network level, based on the existing use cases <ref> [6] </ref>, [7] (see figures 5, 9, 10). Due to time limitations, the case study focused on the VLR node functionality of MO SMS. The occurrence probabilities that are presented are symbolic, since there was no access to real usage behaviour or reliable estimates.
