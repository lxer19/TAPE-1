Title: CODING FOR CONTENT: ENHANCED RESOLUTION FROM CODING  
Author: Roger G. Kermode and Andrew B. Lippman

Affiliation: Media Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  
Abstract: This paper describes a new video coding algorithm[1] that extends the traditional hybrid transform coding techniques used in MPEG[2],[3] in two ways. First, pictures are analyzed and segmented into a number of regions roughly corresponding to the background and any moving foreground objects.These regions are then encoded independently from one another thereby incorporating some degree of useful content into the encoded representation beyond the pictures themselves. Second, the new algorithm also stores the background regions from several frames which can then be used to construct an artificial image at a higher resolution than that of the original background. Furthermore, both of these features are implemented at no overall cost in compression efficiency. In fact the new algorithm still outperforms MPEG, even for particularly degenerate sequences where the underlying assumption used for segmentation is broken.

Reference-contexts: Instead, the image is coded as a montage of semi-homogenous regions in conjunction with an error signal for where the model fails. The structure of the coder borrows many elements from previous coders and image processing techniques in particular MPEG 2 <ref> [3] </ref>, McLean [4], Teodosios Salient Still [5] and the work by Wang, Adelson and Desai [6],[7].

The resulting coding model incorporates the efficiencies of motion compensation using 6 parameter affine models as well as the increased accuracy of standard block based motion compensation for foreground regions that do not match the affine model. <p> The basic mechanism for constructing an image is Frame 1 Frame 2 Raw Segmentation Median Filtered Final Pruned Segmentation Variance Filtered very similar to that used by Irani and Peleg in their work on multiple motion analysis [8] and also that of Teodosio in her work on Salient Stills <ref> [5] </ref>. Each pel to be displayed is reconstructed from a number of previous frames, by collecting a candidate value from each model frame via a bicubic warp and then evaluating a cost function to determine the best value.
