Reference-contexts: A method that expresses the deviation of the sample ordering from an expected ordering could be devised using isotonic regression <ref> (Barlow, Bartholomew, Bremner & Brunk, 1972) </ref>. In this approach, when two sample proportions in a particular rest-score group contradict the overall item ordering, they are replaced by their unweighted mean.

Reference-contexts: Since the rest-score S is a reasonable ordinal estimator of in any plausible monotone unidimensional item response model (Stout, 1990), and since is stochastically ordered by S in the MH model <ref> (Grayson, 1988) </ref>, the particular values s where violations of (26) and (27) occur give us some qualititative information about the location on the ability scale where the IRF's cross.

Reference-contexts: With K items there are K + 1 different perfect item score patterns <ref> (cf. Guttman, 1950) </ref> with ones for the easiest items and zeroes for the more difficult items. For example, given the item ordering according to (7), K = 4, and two correct answers, the perfect pattern is (0011).

Reference-contexts: It has been shown (Stout, 1990) that essential unidimensionality permits estimation of a unique trait ; and that a MH model, extended to an infinite item sequence, satisfies essential unidimensionality. These properties have also been extended to polytomous items <ref> (Junker, 1991) </ref>. Using this approach we may characterize the DM model as follows.

Reference-contexts: Stronger ordering properties are usually based on establishing a monotone likelihood ratio (MLR) property for some observed score S, P [S = tj] is nondecreasing in whenever s t; (4) since it is well-known <ref> (e.g., Junker, 1993, proof of Lemma 4.1) </ref> that this implies that is stochastically ordered by the observed score S, i.e., P [ &gt; cjS = s] P [ &gt; cjS = t] for all s t and all c: (5) Note that S may be scalar-valued (like the number-correct score X <p> i = 1jS = s a ) = E [ i ()jS = s a ] = P (X j = 1jS = s b ) where the first and the last equalities follow from local independence and the inequality follows from (9) and the stochastic ordering of by S <ref> (see for example Lemma 4.1, Junker, 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Note that (7) allows for IRF's to touch or even to coincide. Post's MTR condition (6) is qualitatively similar to but not equivalent to the invariant item ordering property (7). For example, this can be seen with two three-parameter logistic <ref> (Lord, 1980) </ref> items, one with a = 1, b = 1, c = 0 and the other with a = 2, b = 0, c = 0:05: the IRF's do not intersect, but their ratio is not monotone in .

Reference-contexts: The first two categories of methods may be unified in a variety of ways; one can begin with the DT properties of the entire item response distribution P (X = x) <ref> (Rosenbaum, 1987a) </ref>, or the IT properties of the marginal distributions (Z) (where the indicator vector Z shows which items to include), as we have done in Section 3.1.

Reference-contexts: Let Y be the vector with K 2 item score variables excluding the pair X i and X j , and let h (Y ) be any function of Y . It follows immediately <ref> (Rosenbaum, 1987b) </ref> that P (X i = 1jX i + X j = 1; h (Y ) = c; ) = 1 + !() where c is any constant. The next theorem (Rosenbaum, 1987b) follows immediately by integrating over in (22). <p> It follows immediately <ref> (Rosenbaum, 1987b) </ref> that P (X i = 1jX i + X j = 1; h (Y ) = c; ) = 1 + !() where c is any constant. The next theorem (Rosenbaum, 1987b) follows immediately by integrating over in (22). <p> The condition (23) can also be shown <ref> (Rosenbaum, 1987b) </ref> to be equivalent to Taking h (Y ) = S, the rest-score from (8) omitting X i and X j , condition (24) implies that within each rest-score group the ordering of items i and j according to their difficulty is the same.

Reference-contexts: If groups differ systematically on one or more of these characteristics, this may put the members of one group at a disadvantage when test scores from different groups are compared. Unidirectional DIF, and INVARIANT ITEM ORDERING 3 some forms of bidirectional DIF <ref> (Shealy & Stout, 1993) </ref>, may manifest themselves as varying difficulty orderings of items across the different groups. This suggests a DIF methodology based on item difficulty ordering that would be sensitive to both forms of differential item functioning, as well as some forms of differential test functioning.
