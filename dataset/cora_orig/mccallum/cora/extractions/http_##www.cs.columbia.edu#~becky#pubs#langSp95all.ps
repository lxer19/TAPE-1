Reference-contexts: In phrase 3.1, the speaker provides more information than is necessary for unambiguous reference. It has often been suggested that overly informative discourse anaphoric expressions occur at shifts in global discourse focus (Grosz & Sidner 1986) (Webber 1988) <ref> (Allen 1987) </ref> or narrative structure (Marslen-Wilson, Levy & Tyler 1982). The horizontal lines in Fig. 2 represent segment boundaries annotated in the corpus from which this excerpt is taken, where the boundaries derive from a study the author conducted with Diane Litman (Passonneau & Litman 1993).

Reference-contexts: Centering Constraints Here I present only specific aspects of centering to account for the two types of examples illustrated above. I rely primarily on the recent summary article in (Grosz, Joshi & Weinstein 1995), although versions of centering with distinct constructs and rules can be found in (Kameyama 1986) <ref> (Brennan, Friedman & Pollard 1987) </ref> (Walker, Iida & Cote 1994) and (Passonneau 1991), and elsewhere. For an overview of recent empirical studies, I refer the reader to (Prince, Joshi & Walker To appear). <p> On this assumption, e 2 is Cb (U 10 ). The more highly ranked a discourse entity is in Cfs (U i ), "the more likely it is to be Cb (U i+1 )." Here I follow <ref> (Brennan et al. 1987) </ref> in referring to the most highly ranked member of the Cfs as the preferred center (Cp). Thus Cp (U 10 ) is also e 2 .

Reference-contexts: In the last subsection, I discuss three types of attributes used in discourse anaphoric NPs in this corpus. These play a role when it is necessary to generate less economical expressions. Data Coding The corpus consists of ten of the twenty narrations in <ref> (Chafe 1980) </ref>. Chafe recorded and transcribed subjects who had been asked to view the same movie and describe it to a second person. In many respects, the narrators share the same model of what they are to convey. The movie contained seven sequential episodes about a man picking pears. <p> In many respects, the narrators share the same model of what they are to convey.

The transcriptions <ref> (Chafe 1980) </ref> represent all lexical and non-lexical articulations (e.g., "uh, um, tsk") in ordinary orthography. Chafe identified three types of prosodic phrases from graphic displays of intonation contours, and used punctuation to distinguish them. <p> The narratives were first tagged for part of speech.

Reference-contexts: In many of the examples presented in (Grosz & Sidner 1986), discourse segments have discrete boundaries. Recent work has exploited the potential for discourse segments to have sharp boundaries by investigating the correlations of independently verified segment boundaries with various surface cues, such as prosody <ref> (C.H.Nakatani, Hirschberg & Grosz 1995) </ref> (Grosz & Hirschberg 1992) (Litman & Passonneau 1995b), cue words (Morris & Hirst 1991) (Litman & Passonneau 1995b), and discourse anaphoric NPs (Litman & Passonneau 1995b). However, naturally occurring spoken language is often less easily segmented, as argued in (Passonneau & Litman To appearb).

Reference-contexts: Despite this variation, the different subjects assigned the same boundary locations far more frequently than would be predicted by chance. The observed number of agreements on boundaries was highly unlikely (:6 fi 10 9 p :114 fi 10 6 , using Cochran's Q <ref> (Cochran 1950) </ref>; cf. (Litman & Passonneau 1995a)), hence statistically significant. As discussed in (Litman & Passonneau 1995a), boundaries identified by at least 3 subjects reached statistical significance, hence are taken to be empirically validated.

Reference-contexts: The data indicates that by and large, discourse anaphoric NPs are informationally adequate and economical with respect to the global attentional state. They provide adequate information to unambiguously re-evoke discourse entities; the term adequacy is due to <ref> (Dale 1989) </ref>. Further, they comprise the most economical linguistic choices. For noun phrases that violate adequacy or economy, I claim that centering theory provides an explanation. Violations of adequacy have often been discussed in the centering literature. <p> Efficiency requires that the referring expression used must not contain more information than is necessary for the task at hand. Adequacy requires that a referring expression should identify the intended referent unambiguously, and provide sufficient information to serve the purpose of reference. <ref> (Dale 1989) </ref> (p. 70). To meet adequacy, (Dale 1989) requires discourse anaphoric NPs to be distinguishing descriptions. For any set of entities U, (Dale 1989) defines a distinguishing description of a discourse entity e in U to be a set of attribute-value pairs that are true of e, and of no <p> Efficiency requires that the referring expression used must not contain more information than is necessary for the task at hand.

Reference-contexts: They (Grosz & Sidner 1986) make strong claims regarding the relations among these three levels, some of which have been questioned due to insufficient or conflicting evidence (e.g., <ref> (Dale 1992) </ref> (Walker 1995) (Moore & Pollack 1992).) Despite the many open questions, their model is one of the most comprehensive and familiar. <p> The units of linguistic structure as defined in (Grosz & Sidner 1986) are segments. Fig. 3, taken from (Grosz 1977) and discussed in <ref> (Dale 1992) </ref>, shows two discourse segments where one is embedded in the other. Each discourse segment has its own discourse segment purpose (DSP) in intentional structure, and a corresponding focus space (FS) in attentional state. <p> In (Grosz & Sidner 1986) the weaker claim is made that there are different constraints on referring expressions within versus across segments. <ref> (Dale 1992) </ref> argues that no convincing evidence has been presented to substantiate either claim. Both (Grosz & Sidner 1986) and (Reichman 1985) suggest that the use of a full noun phrase where a pronoun would have been adequate correlates with segment or topic shifts. <p> Within the class of bare noun phrases, I follow (Dale & Reiter 1994) in assuming a preference for heads that denote basic category information (e.g., house is preferred over domicile). Dale's implementation of adequacy (Dale 1989) <ref> (Dale 1992) </ref> is elegant and simple. The ae-describe relation proposed below incorporates his algorithm. <p> The algorithm for constructing a distinguishing description <ref> (Dale 1992) </ref> of e in U, given a set P of attribute-value pairs that are true of e, briefly works as follows. U is set to be the entities in the current global focus. Compute F for each member of P. <p> In this section, I present an algorithm that constrains discourse anaphoric NPs to be adequate and economical, i.e., well-specified. In the Background section, I reviewed the algorithm for enforcing adequacy and efficiency presented in (Dale 1989) <ref> (Dale 1992) </ref>. The algorithm presented here|ae-describe|enforces adequacy and economy. <p> Ae-describe is a 4-place relation among a discourse entity E, a surface NP, the current utterance context U , and the focus space context FS. By definition, discourse anaphoric NPs must be definite (but cf. (Passonneau 1994a)). Ae-describe requires a discourse anaphoric NP to be a distinguishing description <ref> (Dale 1992) </ref> of E relative to FS " U . For generation, NP is solved for given an instantiation of the remaining three arguments; for understanding, E is solved for. <p> Ae-describe first tries to generate a pronoun, but fails. The semantically acceptable pronoun "he" fails to distinguish between guy'(e 2 ) and pear picker'(e 1 ). Next ae-describe tries to generate a minimal noun phrase (MIN). The attribute value pairs lexicalized as what <ref> (Dale 1992) </ref> and (Reiter 1990b) refer to as the basic type of e 2 |"man"|will be selected in order to generate a noun phrase with a common noun as head and no modifiers. <p> Ae-describe first tries to generate a pronoun. The pronoun 19 Centering and Informational Constraints "it" is a distinguishing description <ref> (Dale 1992) </ref> in this context. An analogous process applies to understanding discourse anaphoric noun phrases. <p> A notable example of such an alternative is found in Dale <ref> (Dale 1992) </ref>. For his domain of recipe generation, Dale (Dale 1992) defines the discourse center to be the entity that results from each next recipe operation that is described. After an utterance of Stir the rice 1 , rice 1 is the discourse center. <p> A notable example of such an alternative is found in Dale <ref> (Dale 1992) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: When do speakers provide less information information in their utterances than is necessary for unambiguous reference, and when do they provide just enough information? As pointed out in <ref> (Dale & Reiter 1994) </ref>, speakers sometimes provide more information than is necessary for unambiguous reference. The discourse excerpt shown in Fig. 2 depicts an unnecessarily informative discourse anaphoric noun phrase taken from a narrative monologue about a man picking pears. <p> This enforces adequacy. He defines a minimal distinguishing description to be one where the cardinality of the attribute-value pairs cannot be reduced. This addresses efficiency. (Reiter 1990b) argues that to generate maximally efficient NPs using Dale's framework is intractable. <ref> (Dale & Reiter 1994) </ref> later argue that maximal efficiency is psychologically implausible and empirically incorrect. It can be added that, in the absence of a non-arbitrary theory of lexical decomposition, cardinality of attribute value pairs is itself an arbitrary measure of efficiency. <p> is intractable. <ref> (Dale & Reiter 1994) </ref> later argue that maximal efficiency is psychologically implausible and empirically incorrect. It can be added that, in the absence of a non-arbitrary theory of lexical decomposition, cardinality of attribute value pairs is itself an arbitrary measure of efficiency. To address some of these problems, (Dale & Reiter 1994) adopt (Reiter 1990a)'s notion of local brevity, a preference for the shorter of any two distinguishing descriptions. Where "the small dog" and "the sleeping female dog" are distinguishing descriptions, local brevity is satisfied by the former expression. <p> The semantic interpretation of a definite description entails the semantic interpretation of a definite pronoun when they have the same grammatical features (gender, number, animacy, definiteness), and so on. Within the class of bare noun phrases, I follow <ref> (Dale & Reiter 1994) </ref> in assuming a preference for heads that denote basic category information (e.g., house is preferred over domicile). Dale's implementation of adequacy (Dale 1989) (Dale 1992) is elegant and simple. The ae-describe relation proposed below incorporates his algorithm. <p> For example, in Fig. 6, three boys are referred to in U 85 as "these little boys," repeating the prevrious phrase mentioned in the reference to the boys (in U 84 ). (Here "little" is an example of the use of an unnecessary modifier; cf. discussion of <ref> (Dale & Reiter 1994) </ref> in the Background section.) Lexical focus occurs in other genres, e.g., technical writing (Reiter, personal communication).

Reference-contexts: The problem of identifying constraints on the choice between pronouns and full noun phrases relates directly to constraints on the speaker, hence to natural language generation. Here, I briefly review relevant work on generating referring expressions. Dale translates the Gricean <ref> (Grice 1975) </ref> injunctions to be informative and to be brief into his principles of efficiency and adequacy. These principles pertain only to the function of referring, requiring the information in a referring expression to be sufficient for unambiguous re-identification of the intended referent in the given context.

Reference-contexts: Recent work has exploited the potential for discourse segments to have sharp boundaries by investigating the correlations of independently verified segment boundaries with various surface cues, such as prosody (C.H.Nakatani, Hirschberg & Grosz 1995) <ref> (Grosz & Hirschberg 1992) </ref> (Litman & Passonneau 1995b), cue words (Morris & Hirst 1991) (Litman & Passonneau 1995b), and discourse anaphoric NPs (Litman & Passonneau 1995b).

Reference-contexts: However, there is a tendency to interpret such pronouns as indicated by the co-indexing|as coreferential with the preceding subject pronoun (e j )|due in part to the structural parallelism of 1b. and 1c. As described later in this paper, centering theory (Joshi & Weinstein 1981) <ref> (Grosz, Joshi & Weinstein 1983) </ref> (Kameyama 1985) gives an account of the inferences for interpreting pronouns in such contexts. <p> Centering (5) a. A woman (e j ) went to the bookstore. b. Afterwards, she (e j ) gave her aunt (e k ) a new book. c. She's (e j ) a true bibliophile. Centering is a model of local focus of attention (Joshi & Weinstein 1981) <ref> (Grosz et al. 1983) </ref> (Kameyama 1985). Among the motivations for centering is the goal of limiting the domain of inferences pertaining to the interpretation of under-specified expressions, such as definite pronouns. <p> Dale tracks the discourse center across utterances, allowing the discourse center to be realized by a pronoun or to be elided. In addition, no other entities can be realized by a pronoun unless the discourse center is. This latter constraint implements a centering rule proposed in <ref> (Grosz et al. 1983) </ref>, and included as Rule 1 in (Grosz et al. 1995). <p> This rule was originally proposed in <ref> (Grosz et al. 1983) </ref>, but does not appear in (Grosz et al. 1995). <p> note that the Cb need not be realized as a pronoun, but that "it appears such uses are best when the full definite noun phrases that realize the centers do more than just refer." Handling non-referential effects is beyond the scope of this paper, so I retain Rule 3 from <ref> (Grosz et al. 1983) </ref>. I assume that the process of selecting and ordering the situations mentioned in successive utterances of a 26 Centering and Informational Constraints narrative takes place during content planning, and makes use of narrative relations such as those described above. <p> Let us turn now to a centering account of the violation of economy that occurs in U 10 of Fig. 12. Again, the first task is to determine Cb (U 10 ). <ref> (Grosz et al. 1983) </ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) claim that every utterance within a discourse segment has a Cb; whether a segment internal utterance optionally has a Cb is not specified. <p> Di Eugenio argues that because gender marking occurs early enough in the utterance to prevent a garden path effect, null pronouns can be used where centering would otherwise predict a stressed pronoun. 6 The author has recordings of the narratives. 7 In <ref> (Grosz et al. 1983) </ref>, centering is restricted to utterances that are adjacent within a discourse segment, but, as noted in (Passonneau To appear), the most coherent intra-segment centering transitions seem to apply at some segment boundaries.

Reference-contexts: In many of the examples presented in (Grosz & Sidner 1986), discourse segments have discrete boundaries. Recent work has exploited the potential for discourse segments to have sharp boundaries by investigating the correlations of independently verified segment boundaries with various surface cues, such as prosody <ref> (C.H.Nakatani, Hirschberg & Grosz 1995) </ref> (Grosz & Hirschberg 1992) (Litman & Passonneau 1995b), cue words (Morris & Hirst 1991) (Litman & Passonneau 1995b), and discourse anaphoric NPs (Litman & Passonneau 1995b). However, naturally occurring spoken language is often less easily segmented, as argued in (Passonneau & Litman To appearb). <p> Centering Constraints Here I present only specific aspects of centering to account for the two types of examples illustrated above. I rely primarily on the recent summary article in <ref> (Grosz, Joshi & Weinstein 1995) </ref>, although versions of centering with distinct constructs and rules can be found in (Kameyama 1986) (Brennan, Friedman & Pollard 1987) (Walker, Iida & Cote 1994) and (Passonneau 1991), and elsewhere. <p> For an overview of recent empirical studies, I refer the reader to (Prince, Joshi & Walker To appear). Centering constrains the inferences that relate adjacent utterances. 7 More specifically, centering constrains realization of discourse entities. 8 <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) </ref> argue that a combination of syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic factors must be taken into account in characterizing whether an expression U directly realizes a discourse entity e, where e is the interpretation assigned to U. <p> A discourse entity can also be realized indirectly in the interpretation of an utterance. They conclude that specification of the discourse entities realized in an utterance "depends on the semantic theory one adopts." While most of the centering literature deals with discourse entities evoked by singular definite noun phrases, <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) </ref> state that the theory should be extended to handle plural and quantified noun phrases, indefinites, and in addition, that "events and other entities that are more often directly realized by verb phrases can also be centers." 9 At first, I will restrict my attention to singular definite <p> The discourse entities realized in one utterance comprise a partial domain of entities that might be realized in the next utterance. These entities are referred to as the forward-looking centers (Cfs) <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) </ref>, and are partially ordered to reflect their likelihood of being re-mentioned. The precise means for ordering the Cfs is not of concern here. 10 Fig. 13 shows a discourse entity e 2 directly realized, or evoked, by the definite pronoun in U 10 . <p> Ignoring temporal and situational entities for the moment, the Cf list for U 10 contains only this discourse entity. An utterance may also contain a backward-looking center (Cb), linking it to the previous utterance. The Cb is obligatory or optional, depending on the version of centering. According to <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) </ref>, the Cb of an utterance U i+1 is "the most highly ranked element of Cfs (U i ) that is realized in U i+1 ." Here, e 2 , the only discourse entity evoked in U 10 , is not in Cfs (U 9 ). <p> For Fig. 13, for example, centering predicts that Cp (U 10 ) is the most likely candidate for Cb (U 11 ), thus constraining the interpretation of the pronoun subject in U 11 to be e 2 . In addition, <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) </ref> claim that maintaining the same entity as Cb across adjacent utterances produces the most coherent discourse. They introduce three centering transitions to constrain the realization of the current Cb (cf. Fig. 15 and accompanying discussion below). <p> In addition, no other entities can be realized by a pronoun unless the discourse center is. This latter constraint implements a centering rule proposed in (Grosz et al. 1983), and included as Rule 1 in <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) </ref>. In Fig. 14, I show the (Grosz et al. 1995) version of Rule 1 along with my semiformal representation, including the contrapositive, which I will make use of later. (Note that pronoun in this and the other rules means third person definite pronoun.)

(Note that pronoun in this and the other rules means third person definite pronoun.) Following (Grosz et al. 1995), I take all the centering rules to be defeasible inferences (;). <p> Instead, I use the existing narratives to hypothesize what the Cb of each utterance is, based on the centering rules presented in <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) </ref> and on the conventions of narrative discourse. The data presented in the evaluation section is a partial test of these hypotheses. <p> Fig. 15 depicts the continuation transition mentioned above, 25 Centering and Informational Constraints Rule 3: (Cb (U i ) = Cb (U i+1 )) ; pronoun (realize in (Cb,U i+1 ))) along with two other transition types: retention and shifting. By Rule 2 from <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) </ref>, shown at the bottom of the figure, sequences of utterances that exhibit center continuation are preferred over those that exhibit retention, which are in turn preferred over those that exhibit shifting. <p> This rule was originally proposed in (Grosz et al. 1983), but does not appear in <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) </ref>. Instead, (Grosz et al. 1995) note that the Cb need not be realized as a pronoun, but that "it appears such uses are best when the full definite noun phrases that realize the centers do more than just refer."

Instead, (Grosz et al. 1995) note that the Cb need not be realized as a pronoun, but that "it appears such uses are best when the full definite noun phrases that realize the centers do more than just refer." Handling non-referential effects is beyond the scope of this paper, so I retain <p> We already have that Cb (U 11 ) = Cb (U 10 ), so continuation will occur if Cb (U 11 ) = Cp (U 11 ). Much empirical work suggests that in English, the Cp of an utterance is often the grammatical subject (cf. citations in <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) </ref>; (Passonneau 1991). Second, by Rule 3, there is a preference for e 2 to be realized as a pronoun. The actual utterance satisfies both these constraints on surface form. In particular, it is conformance to Rule 3 that gives rise to the violation of informational adequacy. <p> Let us turn now to a centering account of the violation of economy that occurs in U 10 of Fig. 12. Again, the first task is to determine Cb (U 10 ). (Grosz et al. 1983) <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) </ref> claim that every utterance within a discourse segment has a Cb; whether a segment internal utterance optionally has a Cb is not specified. Both (Kameyama 1986) and (Passonneau 1993) propose that an utterance need not have a Cb, independently of whether it is segment initial. <p> The only discourse entity or discourse entities in common to both situations involve the space-time coordinates. Presumably, the time and location could be said to be realized by the utterances, given an appropriate theory of dynamic semantic interpretation <ref> (Grosz et al. 1995) </ref>. For example, in the framework outlined in (Kameyama et al. 1993), both utterances would have the same discourse reference interval: an under-specified component of the logical forms of the utterances that is resolved incrementally against the context.

Reference-contexts: In phrase 3.1, the speaker provides more information than is necessary for unambiguous reference. It has often been suggested that overly informative discourse anaphoric expressions occur at shifts in global discourse focus <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref> (Webber 1988) (Allen 1987) or narrative structure (Marslen-Wilson, Levy & Tyler 1982). <p> Note that the boxed noun phrase happens to occur at an empirically identified segment boundary, and that segments have been proposed to reflect global discourse focus <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref>. <p> Results improve dramatically with the addition of global focus, and again with the addition of centering. In the conclusion, I point out certain asymmetries between generation and understanding, and suggest directions for future work. BACKGROUND The Discourse Processing Model <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref> propose a tri-partite model of discourse consisting of intentional structure, linguistic structure and attentional state. They (Grosz & Sidner 1986) make strong claims regarding the relations among these three levels, some of which have been questioned due to insufficient or conflicting evidence (e.g., (Dale 1992) (Walker 1995) <p> In the conclusion, I point out certain asymmetries between generation and understanding, and suggest directions for future work. BACKGROUND The Discourse Processing Model <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref> propose a tri-partite model of discourse consisting of intentional structure, linguistic structure and attentional state. They (Grosz & Sidner 1986) make strong claims regarding the relations among these three levels, some of which have been questioned due to insufficient or conflicting evidence (e.g., (Dale 1992) (Walker 1995) (Moore & Pollack 1992).) Despite the many open questions, their model is one of the most comprehensive and familiar. <p> Here I briefly sketch the main components of their model in order to identify the assumptions I adopt, and to set the stage for the empirical questions posed here. The units of linguistic structure as defined in <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref> are segments. Fig. 3, taken from (Grosz 1977) and discussed in (Dale 1992), shows two discourse segments where one is embedded in the other. Each discourse segment has its own discourse segment purpose (DSP) in intentional structure, and a corresponding focus space (FS) in attentional state. <p> Each discourse segment has its own discourse segment purpose (DSP) in intentional structure, and a corresponding focus space (FS) in attentional state. Each focus space in attentional state represents the corresponding DSP, and the discourse entities in focus <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref>. <p> At utterance 11, DSP 1 and its attendant focus space is resumed and the original tent (e 1 ) is again in focus. Thus the discourse anaphoric noun phrase the tent in U 15 is unambiguously inferred to evoke e 1 . Discourse segments are theoretical constructs in <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref>. A contrasting view of the role of discourse segments is found in much of the discourse literature. In (Webber 1988) (Polanyi 1988) and (Hobbs 1985) for example, utterances contribute to semantic representations of discourse structure, but discourse segments are not explicitly represented in the model. <p> The relations among nodes have been variously argued to comprise a tree (Webber 1991) (Polanyi 1988) (Hobbs 1985), a lattice (Moore & Pollack 1992), or any of various graph structures that can include cycles (Hearst 5 Centering and Informational Constraints 1994). In many of the examples presented in <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref>, discourse segments have discrete boundaries. <p> In <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref> the weaker claim is made that there are different constraints on referring expressions within versus across segments. (Dale 1992) argues that no convincing evidence has been presented to substantiate either claim.

(Dale 1992) argues that no convincing evidence has been presented to substantiate either claim. Both (Grosz & Sidner 1986) and (Reichman 1985) suggest that the use of a full noun phrase where a pronoun would have been adequate correlates with segment or topic shifts. As discussed in the next section, analysis of a corpus of spoken narratives produces no evidence to support the latter claim. <p> I also assume that part of what relates utterances within a segment is that the speaker has a common intention (or Discourse Segment Purpose <ref> (Grosz & Sidner 1986) </ref>) while producing them. For present purposes, I hypothesize that a single empirically derived discourse segment corresponds to a focus space (or a resumption focus space; cf. comments below). I make no assumptions about whether these are minimal focus spaces; some may embed other focus spaces.

Reference-contexts: Recent work has exploited the potential for discourse segments to have sharp boundaries by investigating the correlations of independently verified segment boundaries with various surface cues, such as prosody (C.H.Nakatani, Hirschberg & Grosz 1995) <ref> (Grosz & Hirschberg 1992) </ref> (Litman & Passonneau 1995b), cue words (Morris & Hirst 1991) (Litman & Passonneau 1995b), and discourse anaphoric NPs (Litman & Passonneau 1995b).

Reference-contexts: The woman who is looked at, namely the aunt (e k ), is assumed to be the one who looks pale. Here, lexical and commonsense reasoning weight one interpretation more highly than others. Abductive reasoning <ref> (Hobbs, Stickel, Martin & Edwards 1988) </ref>, as discussed later, provides a mechanism for deriving and weighting the inferences supporting this interpretation. <p> I assume that discourse entities serve to index a semantic representation constituting the current description of the speaker's intended referent, and that these representations are updated as the discourse progresses. They derive from semantic entailments of the speaker's utterances, and from defeasible inferences (cf. <ref> (Hobbs et al. 1988) </ref>). When the discourse model is updated, the discourse entities that have been evoked are dynamically (re-)partitioned into distinct focus spaces. I assume that the focus structure partitions discourse entities into relatively more or less accessible sets, rather than into accessible versus inaccessible ones. <p> A much greater inference load is required for the alternative interpretation. Under this interpretation, occurrence of a new perceptual event must be inferred in which e k and e j have reversed their roles of perceived and perceiver. Use of appropriately weighted abduction rules <ref> (Hobbs et al. 1988) </ref> would result in the former interpretation. CORPUS ANALYSIS In this section I review results derived from an observational study of discourse anaphoric noun phrases in a corpus of spoken monologues in order to propose initial specifications for a generation model.

Reference-contexts: Further, I assume that salience of entities in a situation is a partial order reflected to some degree in thematic structure <ref> (Jackendoff 1990) </ref>. Thus agents and actors are relatively more salient; the time evoked by the main tense is relatively less salient. If the Cb of an utterance is selected during sentence planning, after the thematic structure has been determined, then thematic structure can be used to determine the Cb.

Reference-contexts: As described later in this paper, centering theory (Joshi & Weinstein 1981) (Grosz, Joshi & Weinstein 1983) <ref> (Kameyama 1985) </ref> gives an account of the inferences for interpreting pronouns in such contexts.

In <ref> (Kameyama 1985) </ref>, examples like (6) are presented to illustrate how commonsense reasoning and lexical semantics override centering predictions for default pronoun interpretation. The discourse is structurally parallel to (5). Again, centering would predict that e j (for "the woman") should be the default interpretation of the pronoun in (6c).

Reference-contexts: Centering Constraints Here I present only specific aspects of centering to account for the two types of examples illustrated above. I rely primarily on the recent summary article in (Grosz, Joshi & Weinstein 1995), although versions of centering with distinct constructs and rules can be found in <ref> (Kameyama 1986) </ref> (Brennan, Friedman & Pollard 1987) (Walker, Iida & Cote 1994) and (Passonneau 1991), and elsewhere. For an overview of recent empirical studies, I refer the reader to (Prince, Joshi & Walker To appear). <p> Again, the first task is to determine Cb (U 10 ). (Grosz et al. 1983) (Grosz et al. 1995) claim that every utterance within a discourse segment has a Cb; whether a segment internal utterance optionally has a Cb is not specified. Both <ref> (Kameyama 1986) </ref> and (Passonneau 1993) propose that an utterance need not have a Cb, independently of whether it is segment initial.

Reference-contexts: An over-specified NP that occurs in the first utterance of a new discourse segment is classified as a segment onset (column 2). The discourse segments arguably contain intra-segmental shifts of attention associated with changes in temporal aspect, or shifts in discourse reference time (for definitions assumed here, cf. <ref> (Kameyama, Passonneau & Poesio 1993) </ref>). Over-specified NPs that did not occur at a segment onset, but occurred at a temporal shift, appear in column 3. The fourth column ("Other") includes, e.g., repetitions, repairs, contrastive NPs and unexplained cases. <p> The boy (e 2 ) is mutually known to have been on a bicycle in the previous discourse. Temporal processing (cf. <ref> (Kameyama et al. 1993) </ref>) supports the inference that the boy is still on the bicycle after U 9 . Thus a definite pronoun in U 10 , an utterance describing someone getting off a bicycle, would be well-specified, and ae-describe would generate the definite pronoun "he". <p> The only discourse entity or discourse entities in common to both situations involve the space-time coordinates. Presumably, the time and location could be said to be realized by the utterances, given an appropriate theory of dynamic semantic interpretation (Grosz et al. 1995). For example, in the framework outlined in <ref> (Kameyama et al. 1993) </ref>, both utterances would have the same discourse reference interval: an under-specified component of the logical forms of the utterances that is resolved incrementally against the context. <p> But the ultimate interpretation assigned to U 10 in Fig. 19 (cf. also (6) argues that in case of conflict during understanding, commonsense reasoning has priority. This accords with an argument made in <ref> (Kameyama et al. 1993) </ref>. There we also explored the interaction between centering and Gricean reasoning, proposing a model of temporal centering for constraining the interpretation of simple past and past perfect sentences. <p> Modifications to the present model pertaining to segment boundaries await further study. 8 Technical reasons that are not relevant here motivate a distinction between a speaker's intended referent and the discourse entity evoked by the speaker's use of a referential expression in (Passonneau To appear). 9 Cf. <ref> (Kameyama et al. 1993) </ref> for applications of centering to temporal or situational entities. 10 Various criteria have been proposed for computing this partial order, including properties pertaining to the grammatical role or surface form of the realizing expression, or to parallelism of such features across adjacent utterances. 11 Generation systems typically

Reference-contexts: Only one over-determined discourse anaphoric NP occurred in the 10 narratives examined here, although in other modalities or genres, the frequency can be higher. 3 It is outside the scope of the present paper to model the use of over-determined discourse anaphoric NPs, attributive NPs <ref> (Kronfeld 1986) </ref>, or NPs with other functions beyond providing sufficient information to identify an existing discourse entity. There were 1,233 discourse anaphoric noun phrases in the corpus. Instead of classifying each token, I heuristically identified a set of NPs that were potentially over-specified.

Reference-contexts: Following Rule 2, I assume that a pair of utterances U i and U i+1 within a discourse segment should exhibit continuation. I also assume that coherence within a narrative segment requires situations mentioned in adjacent utterances to be in a narrative relation (cf. <ref> (Lascarides & Oberlander 1992) </ref>). Here I present possible narrative relations in order to motivate a definition of Cb appropriate for generating narrative, rather than as a theory of narrative per se.

Reference-contexts: Recent work has exploited the potential for discourse segments to have sharp boundaries by investigating the correlations of independently verified segment boundaries with various surface cues, such as prosody (C.H.Nakatani, Hirschberg & Grosz 1995) (Grosz & Hirschberg 1992) <ref> (Litman & Passonneau 1995b) </ref>, cue words (Morris & Hirst 1991) (Litman & Passonneau 1995b), and discourse anaphoric NPs (Litman & Passonneau 1995b).

Reference-contexts: They (Grosz & Sidner 1986) make strong claims regarding the relations among these three levels, some of which have been questioned due to insufficient or conflicting evidence (e.g., (Dale 1992) (Walker 1995) <ref> (Moore & Pollack 1992) </ref>.)

In many of the examples presented in (Grosz & Sidner 1986), discourse segments have discrete boundaries.

Reference-contexts: I rely primarily on the recent summary article in (Grosz, Joshi & Weinstein 1995), although versions of centering with distinct constructs and rules can be found in (Kameyama 1986) (Brennan, Friedman & Pollard 1987) (Walker, Iida & Cote 1994) and <ref> (Passonneau 1991) </ref>, and elsewhere. For an overview of recent empirical studies, I refer the reader to (Prince, Joshi & Walker To appear). <p> Much empirical work suggests that in English, the Cp of an utterance is often the grammatical subject (cf. citations in (Grosz et al. 1995); <ref> (Passonneau 1991) </ref>. Second, by Rule 3, there is a preference for e 2 to be realized as a pronoun. The actual utterance satisfies both these constraints on surface form. In particular, it is conformance to Rule 3 that gives rise to the violation of informational adequacy.

Reference-contexts: Ae-describe is a 4-place relation among a discourse entity E, a surface NP, the current utterance context U , and the focus space context FS. By definition, discourse anaphoric NPs must be definite (but cf. <ref> (Passonneau 1994a) </ref>). Ae-describe requires a discourse anaphoric NP to be a distinguishing description (Dale 1992) of E relative to FS " U . For generation, NP is solved for given an instantiation of the remaining three arguments; for understanding, E is solved for.

Reference-contexts: A surface constituent is considered to be a discourse anaphoric noun phrase (NP) if it occurs in free variation with syntactically prototypical NPs, and corefers with a preceding NP (cf. <ref> (Passonneau 1994b) </ref>). <p> is also included, namely zero pronoun subjects that occur in certain utterance fragments (cf. prosodic phrase 14.1 in Fig. 4) or utterances with (non-embedded) conjoined tensed verb phrases. 1 For purposes of examining coreference relations across clauses, a clause unit referred to as a functionally independent clause (FIC) was defined <ref> (Passonneau 1994b) </ref>. Briefly, an FIC is a tensed clause that is not a verb argument, not a restrictive relative clause, nor one of a set of formulaic "interjection" clauses (e.g., "You know", as in PP 15.2 of Fig. 4; for full details cf. (Passonneau 1994b)). <p> a functionally independent clause (FIC) was defined <ref> (Passonneau 1994b) </ref>.

In <ref> (Passonneau 1995) </ref>, I argued that U 9 and U 10 in Fig. 12 are examples of utterances that have null Cbs because neither utterance contains a discourse anaphoric NP that realizes a discourse entity from the previous utterance in the segment.

A contrasting view of the role of discourse segments is found in much of the discourse literature. In (Webber 1988) <ref> (Polanyi 1988) </ref> and (Hobbs 1985) for example, utterances contribute to semantic representations of discourse structure, but discourse segments are not explicitly represented in the model.

(Dale 1992) argues that no convincing evidence has been presented to substantiate either claim. Both (Grosz & Sidner 1986) and <ref> (Reichman 1985) </ref> suggest that the use of a full noun phrase where a pronoun would have been adequate correlates with segment or topic shifts. As discussed in the next section, analysis of a corpus of spoken narratives produces no evidence to support the latter claim.

Reference-contexts: It can be added that, in the absence of a non-arbitrary theory of lexical decomposition, cardinality of attribute value pairs is itself an arbitrary measure of efficiency. To address some of these problems, (Dale & Reiter 1994) adopt <ref> (Reiter 1990a) </ref>'s notion of local brevity, a preference for the shorter of any two distinguishing descriptions. Where "the small dog" and "the sleeping female dog" are distinguishing descriptions, local brevity is satisfied by the former expression.

Reference-contexts: This enforces adequacy. He defines a minimal distinguishing description to be one where the cardinality of the attribute-value pairs cannot be reduced. This addresses efficiency. <ref> (Reiter 1990b) </ref> argues that to generate maximally efficient NPs using Dale's framework is intractable. (Dale & Reiter 1994) later argue that maximal efficiency is psychologically implausible and empirically incorrect. <p> generated if it is a distinguishing description; MIN: else a minimal noun phrase where the syntactic criterion is that the attributes must map to a noun phrase consisting solely of a determiner and head noun (no modifiers), and the semantic criterion is that the head must denote a basic category <ref> (Reiter 1990b) </ref>. 17 Centering and Informational Constraints FULL: else any full noun phrase expressing a focussed attribute, either a bare NP whose head is more specific those generated in the MIN class (e.g., lexical focus), or an NP with modifiers. <p> Ae-describe first tries to generate a pronoun, but fails. The semantically acceptable pronoun "he" fails to distinguish between guy'(e 2 ) and pear picker'(e 1 ). Next ae-describe tries to generate a minimal noun phrase (MIN). The attribute value pairs lexicalized as what (Dale 1992) and <ref> (Reiter 1990b) </ref> refer to as the basic type of e 2 |"man"|will be selected in order to generate a noun phrase with a common noun as head and no modifiers.

Reference-contexts: The narratives were first tagged for part of speech. The tool proposed zero pronoun whenever a tensed verb was found following a conjunction or comma. 2 All 20 narratives from (Chafe 1980) were segmented, using a total of 140 subjects. 3 In the basketball reports analyzed in <ref> (Robin 1994) </ref> over-determined NPs occur frequently. 4 Cf.

The 36 REFERENCES Centering and Informational Constraints implementation described in the evaluation section does not include full sentence planning. 12 With respect to predicting the over-specified NP, my two approaches amount to notational variants. 13 The input data has been simplified somewhat for expository purposes.

I assume, following (Karttunen 1976) <ref> (Webber 1978) </ref> (Heim 1983) and (Kamp 1981), that a discourse entity is a term or variable in the discourse model that serves as a vehicle for relating information from distinct utterances 1 Centering and Informational Constraints to the same semantic representation.

Reference-contexts: In phrase 3.1, the speaker provides more information than is necessary for unambiguous reference. It has often been suggested that overly informative discourse anaphoric expressions occur at shifts in global discourse focus (Grosz & Sidner 1986) <ref> (Webber 1988) </ref> (Allen 1987) or narrative structure (Marslen-Wilson, Levy & Tyler 1982).
