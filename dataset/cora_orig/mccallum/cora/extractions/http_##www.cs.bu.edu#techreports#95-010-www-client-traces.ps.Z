Abstract: The explosion of WWW traffic necessitates an accurate picture of WWW use, and in particular requires a good understanding of client requests for WWW documents. To address this need, we have collected traces of actual executions of NCSA Mosaic, reflecting over half a million user requests for WWW documents. In this paper we describe the methods we used to collect our traces, and the formats of the collected data. Next, we present a descriptive statistical summary of the traces we collected, which identifies a number of trends and reference patterns in WWW use. In particular, we show that many characteristics of WWW use can be modelled using power-law distributions, including the distribution of document sizes, the popularity of documents as a function of size, the distribution of user requests for documents, and the number of references to documents as a function of their overall rank in popularity (Zipf's law). Finally, we show how the power-law distributions derived from our traces can be used to guide system designers interested in caching WWW documents.

Reference-contexts: A complete description of our data collection methods and the format of the logfiles is given in [6]; here we only give a high-level summary. We modified Mosaic to record the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) <ref> [1] </ref> of each file accessed by the Mosaic user, as well as the time the file was accessed and the time required to transfer the file from its server (if necessary). 2 For completeness, we record all URLs accessed whether they were served from Mosaic's cache or via a file transfer;

Reference-contexts: By logging internal cache accesses, one can understand the behavior of Mosaic, in order to mimic its actions or to compare them to those of a different caching strategy. Such an approach was taken in <ref> [2] </ref>. 3 2.2.2 Format of the Window History Log The second log file reports the window context of the user when using the browser, i.e., the sequence of documents visited and the windows in which those documents are visited. <p> An example exploration of such a distinction is discussed in <ref> [2] </ref>. The Table shows that from a total of 575,775 requests, 452,862 were for servers outside of the BU domain. This corresponds to 78.6% of all requests. The requests include references to 3026 different sites, of which 2987 were remote and 39 were local. <p> In previous work, we used the raw data from our traces to drive extensive event-driven simulations of client-based caching protocols <ref> [2] </ref>. However, it is also possible to use the distributional results discussed in the last section to gain considerable insight in designing caching strategies. In this section we show a case study of how our high-level distributions can be used to guide caching policies for WWW documents.

Reference-contexts: Previous file-oriented studies have focused on reference patterns established based on logs of proxies [8, 14], or servers [13]. The authors in <ref> [3] </ref> captured client traces, but they concentrated on events at the user interface level in order to study browser and page design. In contrast, our goal in data collection was to acquire a complete picture of the reference behavior and timing of user accesses to the WWW.

Reference-contexts: To instrument Mosaic we identified the routines that are invoked during requests for an object. This required source changes to the files main.c, img.c, mo-www.c, history.c, gui-documents.c, HTAccess.c, HTFTP.c, HTFormat.c, HTGopher.c, HTNews.c, HTTP.c, and 1 From ftp://cs-ftp.bu.edu/techreports/95-010-web-client-traces.tar.gz. 2 We recognized, as discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>, that, technically, a URL does not uniquely identify a document under the HTTP protocol; but like those authors we adopt this simplifying convention. 2 HTML.c.

Reference-contexts: Hence our results reflect the behavior of nearly all the WWW users at our site. Since the time of our study, the preferred browser has become Netscape <ref> [5] </ref>, which is not available in source form. As a result, capturing an equivalent set of WWW user traces at the current time would be significantly more difficult. In this paper we will refer to a single execution of Mosaic as a session.

Reference-contexts: The browser we used was Mosaic, since its source was publicly available and permission has been granted for using and modifying the code for research purposes.

Reference-contexts: The introduction of the World Wide Web (WWW) and the explosion in network traffic attributed to it <ref> [9] </ref> means that an accurate picture of WWW traffic is extremely important for evaluating various bandwidth-reduction techniques | such as information caching, dissemination, and discovery protocols. Records of traffic to any particular server are readily available, as each server typically logs the requests it serves.

Reference-contexts: A comparison of WWW document sizes with the file size distribution that might be found in a typical Unix file system is instructive. While there is no truly "typical" Unix file system, an aggregate picture of file sizes on over 1000 different Unix file systems is reported in <ref> [10] </ref>. In The Figure plots the percentage of all files in exponentially increasing bins, on a log-log scale.

Reference-contexts: Thus at the present time, the distribution of transfer sizes is more strongly determined by document sizes than by user preferences, although both contribute. The final instance of hyperbolic distributions in our data occurs as an instance of Zipf's law [15, discussed in <ref> [11] </ref>]. Zipf's law was originally applied to the relationship between a word's popularity in terms of rank and its frequency of use.
