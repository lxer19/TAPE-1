Abstract: For analytic discrete-time systems, it is shown that uniform forward accessibility implies the generic existence of universal nonsingular control sequences. A particular application is given by considering forward accessible systems on compact manifolds. For general systems, it is proved that the complement of the set of universal sequences of infinite length is of the first category. For classes of systems satisfying a descending chain condition, and in particular for systems defined by polynomial dynamics, forward accessibility implies uniform forward accessibility.

Reference-contexts: It is therefore useful to ask under which conditions a system of the form (3) is uniformly accessible from the whole state space M . In <ref> [2] </ref> some conditions guaranteeing forward accessibility of discrete time systems have been investigated. These depend on the topology of M or on the dynamical behavior of the system. In this section we investigate certain system classes which guarantee (forward) uniform accessibility on M from forward accessibility.

Reference-contexts: To an algebraic set X we may associate the ideal I (X) of polynomials that vanish on X. By the Hilbert Basis theorem any increasing chain of ideals in R [X 1 ; : : : ; X d ] is stationary, i.e. the ring is Noetherian, see <ref> [3] </ref> Chapter 7. As a consequence a descending chain of algebraic sets in R d is stationary as X 1 X 2 implies I (X 1 ) I (X 2 ).

Reference-contexts: For an introduction to real-algebraic manifolds, i.e. real-algebraic varieties that do not have singular points we refer to <ref> [4] </ref> Chapter 3. To keep technicalities to a minimum we will restrict ourselves to embedded real-algebraic manifolds here. We briefly recall the basic notions of real-algebraic sets. A set X R d is called algebraic if it is the zero locus of a set of polynomials in d 8 indeterminates. <p> We note that if M is a real-algebraic manifold and X is an algebraic subset of M then also M n X may be interpreted as an embedded real-algebraic manifold, see <ref> [4] </ref> Proposition 3.2.10. Given two real-algebraic embedded manifolds Y; Z a map f : Y ! Z is called algebraic (or regular in [4]) if each coordinate function is an element of the ring of algebraic functions on Y given by f q We are now in a position to formulate <p> M is a real-algebraic manifold and X is an algebraic subset of M then also M n X may be interpreted as an embedded real-algebraic manifold, see <ref> [4] </ref> Proposition 3.2.10. Given two real-algebraic embedded manifolds Y; Z a map f : Y ! Z is called algebraic (or regular in [4]) if each coordinate function is an element of the ring of algebraic functions on Y given by f q We are now in a position to formulate the following corollary. Corollary 4.3 Let M; ~ U be real-algebraic, embedded manifolds.

Reference-contexts: Note that in this case condition (iii) is superfluous as analytic subsets of complex manifolds are nowhere separating so that in this case W t and U t (x) have only one connected component, see <ref> [5] </ref>, Proposition 7.4. Corollary 3.3 Let M; U be complex manifolds and let M be compact. Assume that the map f : (M fi U ) n X ! M is holomorphic, where again X is an analytic subset of M fi U .

Reference-contexts: For details on this question see <ref> [6] </ref>, Chapter IV, Proposition 4'. Let us note that from (4) it follows that X t is a closed, -analytic subset of M fi U t . This may be seen in an inductive manner, as follows. For t = 1, the statement is clear by assumption. <p> Note that in general a descending chain of analytic sets is only stationary on compact subsets of M , see <ref> [6] </ref> Corollary 1 to Theorem V.2.1. Theorem 4.2 Let system (3) be forward accessible and assume that f satisfies a descending chain condition. Then, there exists a t 2 N such that system (3) is uniformly accessible from M in time t. Proof.

Reference-contexts: In the real case this property fails to hold. In order to remedy the situation the class of subanalytic sets has been introduced, see <ref> [12] </ref> for an overview of the theory. <p> A -analytic set is defined as an at most countable union of embedded manifolds. (This extends the class of subanalytic sets as a subanalytic set can always be decomposed into a locally finite countable union of embedded submanifolds, see <ref> [12] </ref> Sections 8/9.) To summarize we have now defined analytic, semi-analytic, subanalytic and -analytic sets, where each class is an extension of the previous one. The dimension of a -analytic set is defined as the maximal dimension of one of its components.
