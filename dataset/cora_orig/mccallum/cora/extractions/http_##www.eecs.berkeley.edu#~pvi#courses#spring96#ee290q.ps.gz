Reference-contexts: Recently, there has been work in re-entrant lines and multi-class queuing systems where it has been seen that the classical &lt; condition is not sufficient for stability of the system. <ref> [1] </ref>, [3], [2] show some recent work in this direction. In Section 6, we look at re-entrant lines and derive a sufficient condition for stability of the switching system (with subsystems being re-entrant lines), under arbitrary convergent, non-interruptive switching. <p> = k i ; 8i 6= 1; 2 3 i6=1;2 P 2 = 1; 8i 6= 2; 3 2;1 3;2 Now let the switching sequence fw i g be w i = &lt; 1 i odd 2 i even Now, starting with state 0, (i.e., the initial distribution 0 = <ref> [1; 0 : : :] </ref>), the state 2 can never be reached. i.e., the matrix P 3 = P 1 P 2 is reducible. <p> ( + fl) r=1 (2) Now, dividing by n on both sides and letting n ! 1 we have ( + fl) S 0 0 Hence S 0 &gt; 0 and the switching system is strongly ergodic. 6 A sufficient condition for re-entrant lines We review the problem considered in <ref> [1] </ref> and look at it in the context of a switching system. 9 6.1 System model and transition probabilities Consider a system of the form shown in Fig 1. Such networks are called "re-entrant lines"[14]. It consists of S servers labeled 1; 2; : : :S. <p> This framework is as in <ref> [1] </ref> 6.2 Model of the Switching System Now, we consider w (t) a switching sequence such that w (t) 2 f1; 2; : : :N g. <p> We first show a preliminary result from <ref> [1] </ref>. Lemma 1 Let Q = [q ij ] be a symmetric matrix. <p> Hence (18) holds, since by dividing by kfl, 1 k1 X E j x (t n ) j fl 1 x T (t 0 ) Qx (t 0 ) 8k We now provide as in <ref> [1] </ref> a constructive procedure to verify the existence of such a copositive Q and fl &gt; 0. Proceeding as in [1] we have that the search for the appropriate Q can be reduced to a linear program in the elements of Q. Theorem 6.2 1. <p> dividing by kfl, 1 k1 X E j x (t n ) j fl 1 x T (t 0 ) Qx (t 0 ) 8k We now provide as in <ref> [1] </ref> a constructive procedure to verify the existence of such a copositive Q and fl &gt; 0.

We first give some definitions. <p> A convenient approach to the study of both weak and strong ergodicity is by means of an appropriate contraction coefficient; in the stochastic setting called coefficients of ergodicity. Definition 7 We call any continuous function t () : P ! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> where P is a stochastic matrix, as a coefficient of ergodicity. The coefficient is said to be proper if t (P ) = 0 iff P = 1 where is any probability vector.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Queuing systems have been modeled as continuous time Markov chains with the state space as a vector of number of customers queued up at the servers, under the assumption of Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. A vast amount of detail is available in literature <ref> [4] </ref> on stability conditions under various assumptions on arrival and service time processes. In this paper we consider CTMC models of queuing systems.

Reference-contexts: Thus, this ensures that the resulting switched system is irreducible and aperiodic. 5 A Sufficient Condition for Stability The following result provides a sufficient condition for stability as in Defn 1. We first characterize convergent switching sequences. Then using the drift criterion in <ref> [6] </ref>, we prove a sufficient condition for stability as in Defn 1 for any arbitrary convergent switching sequence.

Reference-contexts: We first give some definitions.

The dichotomy of the chain is claimed by: Theorem 7.1 If is '-irreducible, then is either recurrent or transient. Some useful results involving petite sets and uniformly transient sets are given below. The proofs are in <ref> [9] </ref>. Theorem 7.2 If A is uniformly transient, and A a ; B for some a, then B is also uniformly transient. Theorem 7.3 If is '-irreducible and transient then every petite set is uniformly transient.

A Finite State Inhomogeneous Markov Chain Theory In this section, we review the results in Finite state Inhomogeneous Markov chain theory and the results are drawn from <ref> [12] </ref>. We state the theorems without proofs and hope that the details are sufficient for motivation. It is also a point to note that these results do not extend easily to the case we are interested in, namely, countably infinite state spaces. <p> It is also a point to note that these results do not extend easily to the case we are interested in, namely, countably infinite state spaces. In fact, papers by Seneta.E. et al., after his book <ref> [12] </ref>, do not cover the problem of countably infinite state spaces. We define weak and strong notions of ergodicity and review sufficient conditions for both.

Reference-contexts: A vast amount of detail is available in literature [4] on stability conditions under various assumptions on arrival and service time processes. In this paper we consider CTMC models of queuing systems. Using uniformization <ref> [13] </ref>, we work with a DTMC which is equivalent to the CTMC in the following sense: If the CTMC has a steady state distribution, then so does the DTMC and they are the same.

Reference-contexts: Let fX n g n0 be a time inhomogeneous discrete time Markov chain on a countably infinite state space X. This models a queuing system <ref> [14] </ref> with state space the number of customers queued up at each server under the assumption of Poisson arrivals and exponential service times. Let P n (i; j) = Pr (X n = jjX 0 = i).

Reference-contexts: The other major incomplete work is the analysis of the system when the switching sequence is coming from a Markovian distribution that is independent of the queuing system itself, i.e., the arrival process and service times. This problem has been considered under a very general setting in <ref> [15] </ref>. A Finite State Inhomogeneous Markov Chain Theory In this section, we review the results in Finite state Inhomogeneous Markov chain theory and the results are drawn from [12]. We state the theorems without proofs and hope that the details are sufficient for motivation.
