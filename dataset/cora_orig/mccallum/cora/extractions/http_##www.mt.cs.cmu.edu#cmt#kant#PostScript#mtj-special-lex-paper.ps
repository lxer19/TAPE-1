Abstract: Although knowledge-based MT systems have the potential to achieve high translation accuracy, each successful application system requires a large amount of hand-coded lexical knowledge. Systems like KBMT-89 and its descendents have demonstrated how knowledge-based translation can produce good results in technical domains with tractable domain semantics. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the development task for large-scale applications with tens of thousands of domain concepts precludes a purely hand-crafted approach. The current challenge for the "next generation" of knowledge-based MT systems is to utilize on-line textual resources and corpus analysis software in order to automate the most laborious aspects of the knowledge acquisition process. This partial automation can in turn maximize the productivity of human knowledge engineers and help to make large-scale applications of knowledge-based MT an viable approach. In this paper we discuss the corpus-based knowledge acquisition methodology used in KANT, a knowledge-based translation system for multilingual document production. This methodology can be generalized beyond the KANT interlingua approach for use with any system that requires similar kinds of knowledge.

Reference-contexts: To attenuate this problem and reduce reliance on expert domain knowledge, another use of the source corpus was devised. Following observations that compositionality patterns are often cross-linguistic in nature, especially between closely-related languages like English and French (see e.g., <ref> (Bauer, 1978) </ref>), we succeeded in leveraging the source language corpus to produce data for assisting in the target-language decomposition task. By assuming strictly binary compositional formation (Warren, 1978), we analyzed the source nominal compounds by scoring the subterms at each level of composition.

Reference-contexts: Vocabulary analysis We first had to acquire a working intuition for the nature of the target language vocabulary, in both quantitative and qualitative terms. It was necessary to identify the technical register, assess collocational and compositional patterns, and identify hierarchical and equivalency relationships between vocabulary items (see, for example, <ref> (Bedard, 1986) </ref>). As described in the previous section, we obtained a corpus of ACQUISITION OF LARGE LEXICONS FOR PRACTICAL KBMT 127 some 280 previously translated documents from the customer. This corpus, as well as serving the purposes of mapping rule construction, also served as a raw corpus for vocabulary analysis.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, there were two considerations which limited the practical potential of the system: * Ambiguity in the Source Text . Although KBMT-89 included a dialog manage ment component which communicated with the user whenever the source text was ambiguous <ref> (Brown, 1991) </ref>, it was possible for the user to write sentences that were sufficiently complicated and ambiguous that system performance was reduced to unacceptable levels. * Run-Time Performance.

Reference-contexts: Creation of the Initial Word and Phrase Lexicons. In order to produce an Initial Lexicon, the Lexicon Creation Program uses a Tagged Corpus (e.g., the tagged Brown Corpus <ref> (Francis and Kucera, 1982) </ref> as a resource for part-of-speech information, in conjunction with a source language morphological analyzer. The Initial Lexicon contains a part of speech marker for each root form found in the Word Corpus.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that the use of explicit representations of domain words and concepts along with semantic processing during translation can achieve a high degree of accuracy in the target text <ref> (Goodman and Nirenburg, 1991) </ref>. 102 D. LONSDALE, T. MITAMURA, AND E. NYBERG 1.1. KBMT at CMU/CMT The first KBMT system built at the CMT was a knowledge-based, interlingual system for doctor-patient communication in English, Japanese and German (Tomita et al., 1987). <p> For example, "the" is mapped onto the feature-value pair (reference definite). Argument Mapping rules map a grammatical function onto a semantic role. Because the KANT source language syntactic grammar is written in an LFG-style formalism <ref> (Goodman and Nirenburg, 1991) </ref>, the Parser produces an f-structure representation of the grammatical functions in the sentence (e.g., SUBJECT, OBJECT). The Interpreter then maps each grammatical function onto an appropriate semantic role in the interlingua.

Reference-contexts: A tagged version of the Brown Corpus was utilized as a resource for part-of-speech tags. 5. This approach can be contrasted with the approach taken in <ref> (Grishman, Macleod, and Meyers, 1994) </ref>, which makes use of on-line resources to enhance lexicons which are created manually.

Reference-contexts: KANT is intended for practical applications, so it involves scaling up lexicons and rule bases to a large degree. For example, in the CATALYST application, there are approximately 60,000 domain concepts. * Interlingua. KANT makes use of a detailed interlingua representation for the meaning of each source sentence <ref> (Lonsdale, Franz, and Leavitt, 1994) </ref>. This supports modular system design (since there are no pair-wise dependencies between source and target languages) and supports accurate translation by capturing the necessary semantic information. * Multiple Target Languages. <p> Specially designed programs are run against this database to automatically create the different kinds of lexical mapping declarations described in this section.

Reference-contexts: A set of mapping rules is used to map source language lexical items onto interlingua structures. There are two types of source lexical mapping rules used in KANT: Lexical Mapping rules and Argument Mapping rules <ref> (Mitamura, 1989) </ref>. Lexical Mapping rules map a content word and part of speech (e.g., "gas", N) onto a set of domain concepts (e.g., *O-GASOLINE, *O-NATURAL-GAS). <p> among members of a mapping class (for example, a class of verbs which ACQUISITION OF LARGE LEXICONS FOR PRACTICAL KBMT 117 exhibit the same mapping behavior), mapping rules are grouped into classes in a hierarchical structure which eliminates redundancy and speeds the process of knowledge acquisition (for more details, see <ref> (Mitamura, 1989) </ref> or (Mitamura and Nyberg, 1992)). This step requires analysis by the source language linguist. 4.2. Discussion Lexical mapping rules are automatically generated from the domain lexicon, which contains pointers to concept nodes.

Reference-contexts: Lexicon Acquisition in KANT Because the focus of this paper is on lexical acquisition rather than the internal details of the run-time system, the reader is spared further detail concerning the Parser, Interpreter, Mapper and Generator. More detail can be found in (Mitamura, Nyberg, and Carbonell, 1991) and <ref> (Nyberg and Mitamura, 1992) </ref>. The relationships between text resources (corpora) and the development of KANT knowledge sources is shown in Figure 2. <p> a mapping class (for example, a class of verbs which ACQUISITION OF LARGE LEXICONS FOR PRACTICAL KBMT 117 exhibit the same mapping behavior), mapping rules are grouped into classes in a hierarchical structure which eliminates redundancy and speeds the process of knowledge acquisition (for more details, see (Mitamura, 1989) or <ref> (Mitamura and Nyberg, 1992) </ref>).

Reference-contexts: This decoupling of code and knowledge makes it easy to extend the system to new languages or domains, or to reuse any part of the system for a new domain. This also supports pre-compilation of declarative knowledge structures into a faster run-time form, improving system performance <ref> (Mitamura, Nyberg, and Carbonell, 1991) </ref>. This type of software design also enhances long-term maintainability of finished applications as new processes or products are added to the domain. 1.3. How KANT Works The basic architecture of KANT is shown in Figure 1. <p> Lexicon Acquisition in KANT Because the focus of this paper is on lexical acquisition rather than the internal details of the run-time system, the reader is spared further detail concerning the Parser, Interpreter, Mapper and Generator. More detail can be found in <ref> (Mitamura, Nyberg, and Carbonell, 1991) </ref> and (Nyberg and Mitamura, 1992).

Reference-contexts: Notes 1. For example, extraction of English/French term pairs from translated texts could only account for 12% of the initial CATALYST French lexicon development, because the small number of aligned texts that were available did not cover the entire domain <ref> (Mitamura, Nyberg, and Carbonell, 1993) </ref>. 2. Concept names are prefixed by the gross semantic category class specifiers *O-, *A-, *P-, *M-, and *U- to represent objects, actions, properties, manners, and units respectively. 3.
