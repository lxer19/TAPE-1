Title: The Non-existence of Finite Projective Planes of Order 10  Dedicated to the memory of  
Author: C. W. H. Lam L. Thiel, and S. Swiercz Herbert J. Ryser 
Date: 15 January, 1989  
Abstract: This note reports the result of a computer search which shows that no 19-point configuration can be extended to a complete finite projective plane of order 10. Previous work has shown that such a plane, if it exists, must contain 24,675 19-point configurations. Together, these results imply the non-existence of a projective plane of order 10. This note presents a brief summary of the previous work and gives some details of the methodology which are not covered by earlier publications. It also argues that, even when the possibility of undetected software or hardware errors is taken into account, the probability is very small that an undiscovered plane of order 10 is missed by all the computer searches.

Reference-contexts: A has constant row sum n + 1, 2. A has constant column sum n + 1, 3. the inner product of any two distinct rows of A is 1, and 2 4. the inner product of any two distinct columns of A is 1. In 1970, several researchers <ref> [1, 15] </ref> started studying the binary error-correcting code associated with a projective plane of order 10. Let A be the incidence matrix of such a plane. Let S be the vector space generated by the rows of A over F 2 . A vector in S is called a codeword. <p> We define the weight enumerator of S to be 111 X w i x i : Each codeword of weight i corresponds to a configuration with i points; please see [8] for more detail. We shall use the terms codeword of weight i and i-point configuration interchangeably. In <ref> [1] </ref>, it was noted that the weight enumerator of S is uniquely determined once w 12 , w 15 , and w 16 are known. In [15], MacWilliams, Sloane, and Thompson showed, using a computer, that w 15 = 0.

Reference-contexts: Since there are about half a million A2's, the probability of a random undetected hardware error affecting this special A2 is about one in half a million. Since the plane is known to have a trivial collineation group <ref> [2, 9, 19] </ref>, it is more likely that there are at least two non-isomorphic A2's amongst the 24,675 cases.

Reference-contexts: The first value of n which is not a prime power is 6.

The celebrated Bruck-Ryser theorem [4] provided another explanation of the non-existence of the plane of order 6. The next open value is n = 10.

Reference-contexts: We find no discrepancy, which gives us faith in the programs. The second method we employ is to apply internal consistency checking when generating the A2's, which is described in more general terms in <ref> [13] </ref>. Basically, when performing isomorphism testing, one can predict the number of times that each A2 is generated by the program. By keeping track of the count, we can at least check that the program performs as expected.
