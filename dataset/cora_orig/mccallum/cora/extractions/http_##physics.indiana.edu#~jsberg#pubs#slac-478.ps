That hierarchy is generally truncated CHAPTER 3. <p> Now that there are two constants of integration, the action variables can be computed in terms of these constants of integration. Action variables are computed by integrating p dq +p s ds around a closed curve on a surface where the integrals of the motion are constant <ref> [3] </ref>. The first action variable, which will be called J q , is computed by integrating around a curve of constant s. The result is that J q = C 2 0 =2.

Reference-contexts: These errors are of order 0.09% for this example. Only the k = 0 terms in the effective impedance (4.84) are considered. This approximation amounts to ignoring "synchro-betatron modes"; these are discussed in greater detail in <ref> [9, 12, 55, 64] </ref>. Suzuki's work [64] seems to indicate that this should be a minimal problem with realistic impedances. t (s) is taken to be zero. This could introduce relative errors of order 2-s , or about 20%.

Reference-contexts: Consider transverse oscillations; longitudinal oscillations follow a similar argument. The bunch will see an average wakefield due to itself. It turns out that for sufficiently short bunches, that average wakefield will give a force in the same direction as the bunch's displacement <ref> [11] </ref>. This causes the oscillation frequency of the m = 0 mode to be reduced from the frequency it had without wakefields. For sufficiently large currents, the frequency of this mode will decrease to the point where it is equal to that of one of the m = 1 modes. <p> The frequency spectrum of the wakefields is called the impedance. Single bunch modes essentially average over the impedance, since their mode spectrum consists of closely spaced lines (as described above). The only exception is for extremely long-range wakefields, which last for several turns. Such wakefields cause the Robinson instability <ref> [11] </ref> and similar instabilities. Multibunch modes, however, have a frequency spectrum which is widely spaced, as described above. Thus, they tend to drive and be driven by small parts of the impedance spectrum; each multi-bunch mode with a different p 0 is driven differently. <p> Note that f (r; ; t ) thus becomes f (r; ; t; s): X r m e im 1 The integral of W m (t; s) over s around the ring is consistent with the W m (z) in <ref> [11] </ref> if z = fi 0 ct . To simplify notation, W 1 is written as W ? , since the contribution of the W 1 wake usually dominates the transverse wake force. CHAPTER 3. <p> will be defined as Z ? Z 1 W m (t; s)e i!t dt: (3.26) The longitudinal impedance is defined to be Z k 1 Z 1 W 0 The integral of these quantities over s around the ring are consistent with the Z ? m and Z m in <ref> [11] </ref>. Note that integrating by parts leads to Z k m (!; s)=fi 0 c. This is a minor variation on what is known as the Panofsky-Wentzel theorem [11]. Note that [Z ? m (! fl )] fl = Z ? k k m (!), since W m is real. <p> 0 The integral of these quantities over s around the ring are consistent with the Z ? m and Z m in <ref> [11] </ref>. Note that integrating by parts leads to Z k m (!; s)=fi 0 c. This is a minor variation on what is known as the Panofsky-Wentzel theorem [11]. Note that [Z ? m (! fl )] fl = Z ? k k m (!), since W m is real. Z 0 is written as Z k , since it usually dominates the longitudinal wake force. <p> 0 ; s) + x n0 (s)] + [y r (; J; s) + y r0 (s)] [y n ( 0 ; J 0 ; s) + y n0 (s)] (3.59) The combining of the terms due to the unperturbed distribution into H r0 is referred to as "potential-well distortion" <ref> [11, 46-48] </ref>, because its effect is as if the potential well keeping the particles focussed were being changed by an external force. No attempt will be made here to quantitatively compute this effect. <p> s=fi 0 c + kT 0 ; s d 3 0 d 3 J 0 Z W FB (3.64) 3.3 Vlasov Equation For non-interacting particles whose motion is governed by a Hamiltonian, Liouville's theorem states that the s-evolution of the probability distribution of particles is governed by the Vlasov equation <ref> [11, 41, 43] </ref> @ + [; H] = 0: (3.65) The [ ] are Poisson brackets [3, 41, 43]. <p> As indicated in section 3.2.5, the first step is to find a s-independent solution of the coupled equations (3.67). The details of finding such a solution are beyond the scope of this dissertation; see <ref> [11, 46-48] </ref>. Note that in the transverse case which is analyzed in chapter 5, this step is unnecessary. This is because any solution which is only a function of the action variables will have no transverse moment, and thus gives a self-consistent solution by default. <p> In particular, fi t is given by equation (A.28), with k p (s) = fi 2 1 0 (4.31) C L 0 c 2 (4.32) e ^ V ! rf : (4.33) C is known as the momentum compaction <ref> [11, 68] </ref>. All potential-well distortion effects will be ignored. <p> The magnetic lattice is assumed to be linear only. Thus, the system is described by equations (4.83)-(4.85). Potential Landau damping effects due to tune shift with amplitude [15, 16, 34, 66, 70] are thus ignored, as well as potential damping effects from chromaticity <ref> [11, 38, 40, 57-59, 63, 66, 67, 70] </ref>. The effect of Landau damping can be estimated: oscillations will be damped if the absolute value of their frequency shift is less than the frequency spread due to nonlinearity in the bulk of the bunch distribution [66]. <p> The effects of chromaticity can be computed from the formalism presented in this dis sertation. It is a complex computation, and has not been completed. However, a good estimate of its effect can be obtained by doing what most authors have done <ref> [11, 38, 40, 57 59,63,66, 67, 70] </ref>, which is to perform the computations by shifting the form factors in (4.84) by ! ~ = ~! 0 = C , the chromatic frequency. Here ~ is the chromaticity [68]. This will be CHAPTER 5. <p> CHAPTER 5. EXAMPLE AND ANALYSIS 52 When the bunches are non-symmetric, the tunes of different bunches will often be different, since they see different wakefields and thus have a different potential-well distortion <ref> [11, 14, 46-48] </ref>. Thus, for example, one can get Landau damping due to the bunch-to-bunch tune spread [14]. The bulk of the bunches have very similar synchrotron frequencies; the variation is about 0.4%. <p> The inductive part of the transverse impedance is obtained by scaling the longitudinal inductive impedance of 83.3 nH [31] by 2c=!b 2 p <ref> [11] </ref>, where b p is a characteristic dimension of the beam pipe. Worst-case values are obtained by performing this scaling with b p = 2:7559 cm, the vertical size of the arc section chamber [50]. <p> The longitudinal impedance (5.6) is scaled by fi 0 c=! to obtain the transverse impedance (see section 3.1.4). 5.2.4 Cavity Higher Order Modes A preliminary list of the cavity higher order modes is given in table 5.2. Each mode is considered to be a single resonator of the form <ref> [11] </ref> Z res R res : (5.7) These impedances must of course be multiplied by the number of cavities. CHAPTER 5. <p> Every occurrence of ! in (4.84) is replaced by ! ! ~ , with the exception of the ! appearing in Z ? . This has been the approach of most every other author <ref> [11, 38, 40, 57-59, 63, 66, 67, 70] </ref>. It may in fact be the correct thing to do in the CHAPTER 5. EXAMPLE AND ANALYSIS 93 formalism presented here; however, the computation has not been completed at this point.

Reference-contexts: This is a good assumption at low current, where the bunch length is dominated by radiation excitation and not potential-well distortion <ref> [30] </ref>. This eliminates the last dependence of the R fiff qpr (; s; s 0 ) defined in equation (4.11) on r, and thus the B fiff qra (; s) and the C fiff qra (; s) of equation (4.12) become independent of r. <p> CHAPTER 4.

Reference-contexts: Thus, R RW for the straight sections is 608 k=m. 5.2.2 Inductive Many devices, such as bellows, BPM's, and slots, give an impedance that is primarily inductive. The inductive part of the transverse impedance is obtained by scaling the longitudinal inductive impedance of 83.3 nH <ref> [31] </ref> by 2c=!b 2 p [11], where b p is a characteristic dimension of the beam pipe. Worst-case values are obtained by performing this scaling with b p = 2:7559 cm, the vertical size of the arc section chamber [50]. <p> To determine the cutoff frequency !

Reference-contexts: The bulk of the bunches have very similar synchrotron frequencies; the variation is about 0.4%. A few bunches at the head and the tail of the bunch train have significantly larger variations (as large as 2%) <ref> [33] </ref>. Since this is only a few bunches, the 0.4% will probably dominate the Landau damping. This gives a tune spread of about 1:3 fi 10 4 . <p> The multibunch longitudinal potential well distortion will shift the synchrotron frequency as well. The effect gives approximately a 2% error in the average synchrotron frequency <ref> [33] </ref>. The terms coupling modes near ! y to modes near ! y (i.e., equation (4.85) ) are ignored, introducing errors of order -s =-y , as described at the end of section 4.3.2. These errors are of order 0.09% for this example. <p> Since the average behavior at high frequencies is expected to be CHAPTER 5. EXAMPLE AND ANALYSIS 55 similar to that of a cavity, a high-frequency roll-off of ! 3=2 is assumed <ref> [33] </ref>. The form for the transverse impedance is thus Z Ind iR Ind where R Ind is the transverse impedance associated with the inductance.

Reference-contexts: CHAPTER 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PHYSICAL SYSTEM 8 Therefore, the two pieces necessary to get resonant driving occur in a single bunch, and give single bunch mode coupling. Single-bunch mode coupling is a well understood phenomenon, and has been studied by many authors <ref> [38, 55, 57, 58, 60, 63, 65] </ref>. 2.2.3 Multibunch Mode Coupling Now, consider a ring containing several bunches. Further, assume that there are wakefields which remain longer than the distance between two bunches. <p> The magnetic lattice is assumed to be linear only. Thus, the system is described by equations (4.83)-(4.85). Potential Landau damping effects due to tune shift with amplitude [15, 16, 34, 66, 70] are thus ignored, as well as potential damping effects from chromaticity <ref> [11, 38, 40, 57-59, 63, 66, 67, 70] </ref>. The effect of Landau damping can be estimated: oscillations will be damped if the absolute value of their frequency shift is less than the frequency spread due to nonlinearity in the bulk of the bunch distribution [66]. <p> The effects of chromaticity can be computed from the formalism presented in this dis sertation. It is a complex computation, and has not been completed. However, a good estimate of its effect can be obtained by doing what most authors have done <ref> [11, 38, 40, 57 59,63,66, 67, 70] </ref>, which is to perform the computations by shifting the form factors in (4.84) by ! ~ = ~! 0 = C , the chromatic frequency. Here ~ is the chromaticity [68]. This will be CHAPTER 5. <p> Every occurrence of ! in (4.84) is replaced by ! ! ~ , with the exception of the ! appearing in Z ? . This has been the approach of most every other author <ref> [11, 38, 40, 57-59, 63, 66, 67, 70] </ref>. It may in fact be the correct thing to do in the CHAPTER 5.

Reference-contexts: All of the bunches are assumed to be identical and equally spaced. This ignores the cross terms between different p 0 and q 0 from equation (4.83). A simple extension of Kohaupt's <ref> [39] </ref> work demonstrates that if the current in symmetrically placed bunches is set equal to the current of the highest-current bunch in the real system, then the growth rate for all the modes with the same zero-current frequency in the real system will be bounded by the largest growth rate for

Reference-contexts: If only a single type of multibunch mode is considered (i.e., all bunches with the same m), then the results are well known, at least in the case of symmetric bunches (identical bunches evenly spaced around the ring) <ref> [40, 59, 60, 67, 70] </ref>. Oscillation modes in the ring are driven when the frequency spectrum of the oscillation mode couples to the frequency spectrum of the wakefields. The frequency spectrum of the wakefields is called the impedance. <p> The magnetic lattice is assumed to be linear only. Thus, the system is described by equations (4.83)-(4.85). Potential Landau damping effects due to tune shift with amplitude [15, 16, 34, 66, 70] are thus ignored, as well as potential damping effects from chromaticity <ref> [11, 38, 40, 57-59, 63, 66, 67, 70] </ref>.

EXAMPLE AND ANALYSIS 93 formalism presented here; however, the computation has not been completed at this point. <p> It should first be pointed out that this method follows what is generally known as the "Wang formalism," after J. M. Wang who developed it originally [57,58,67,70]. It has the advantage of not requiring one to guess basis functions to expand with (which is what the "Sacherer formalism" requires <ref> [40, 59, 60, 70] </ref>): the expansion follows implicitly from the method. This is the only approach which handles the s dependence in the linear case in full detail.

Reference-contexts: Since such a substantial kick is coming from the feedback, and the feedback kick is extremely localized, the arguments in [64] indicate that synchro-betatron resonances can potentially be significant when feedback is added. Synchro-betatron resonances may in fact have caused some problems with the LEP feedback system <ref> [44] </ref>. CHAPTER 5. EXAMPLE AND ANALYSIS 80 5.4.1 Resistive Feedback Examining figure 5.29, it is clear that the modes with the largest growth rates are the m = 0 modes. The feedback system is designed to damp these modes. <p> EXAMPLE AND ANALYSIS 87 the m = 0 mode frequency coincides with the frequency of the m = 1 (radial) modes. This is known as a reactive feedback system, and has been suggested before as a cure for the transverse mode coupling instability <ref> [44, 52, 56] </ref>. The improvement to be expected from reactive feedback is significant, but not nearly as large as would be expected from a single-bunch analysis. The reason can be seen by comparing the single-bunch mode frequencies of figure 5.6 to the multibunch mode frequencies in figure 5.11.

This has been the approach of most every other author <ref> [11, 38, 40, 57-59, 63, 66, 67, 70] </ref>. It may in fact be the correct thing to do in the CHAPTER 5. EXAMPLE AND ANALYSIS 93 formalism presented here; however, the computation has not been completed at this point. <p> It should first be pointed out that this method follows what is generally known as the "Wang formalism," after J. M. Wang who developed it originally [57,58,67,70]. It has the advantage of not requiring one to guess basis functions to expand with (which is what the "Sacherer formalism" requires <ref> [40, 59, 60, 70] </ref>): the expansion follows implicitly from the method. This is the only approach which handles the s dependence in the linear case in full detail.

Reference-contexts: This is because the estimate of the threshold current doesn't include all contributions, and the fact that the model assumed isn't quite accurate. It does, however, give a reasonable first estimate. Similar computations have been suggested by other authors <ref> [57, 63, 71] </ref>. 5.3.2 Multibunch Mode Frequencies Now, consider what happens to the mode frequencies from figure 5.6 when there are multiple bunches. If coupling between the multibunch modes is ignored, the frequencies behave as CHAPTER 5.
