Title: The 3D visibility complex a new approach to the problems of accurate visibility.  
Author: Frdo Durand, George Drettakis and Claude Puech iMAGIS 
Keyword: visibility, visibility complex, spatial coherence, discontinuity meshing, form factor  
Abstract: Visibility computations are central in any computer graphics appli cation. The most common way to reduce this expense is the use of approximate approaches using spatial subdivision. More recently analytic approaches efo ciently encoding visibility have appeared for 2D (the visibility complex) and for certain limited cases in 3D (aspect graph, discontinuity meshes). In this paper we propose a new way of describing and studying the visibility of 3D space by a dual space of the 3D lines, such that all the visibility events are described. A new datastructure is deoned, called the 3D visibility complex, which encapsu lates all visibility events. This structure is global and complete since it encodes all visibility relations in 3D, and is spatially coherent allowing efocient visibility queries such as view extraction, aspect graph, discontinuity mesh, or form factor computation. A construction algorithm and suitable data structures are sketched.

Reference-contexts: For a walkthrough, the view can be maintained since the events where the visibility changes correspond to intersections of the surface described by V with the 1faces of the visibility complex. This approach is similar to the one described in <ref> [2] </ref> where conservative visibility events are lazily computed. 4.2 FormFactors The form factor F ij 4 involved in radiosity computation is the proportion of light that leaves patch i which arrives at patch j.

Reference-contexts: An aspect changes along visibility events which are the same as for the discontinuity meshing tech niques [8]. These techniques have thus been extended with backprojections <ref> [3, 12] </ref> to provide the aspect of the source. <p> We show below that the proposed construction algorithm is O (n log n. As mentioned in the introduction, practical experience with discontinuity meshing has shown that the scenes studied in computer graphics tend to have more optimistic visibility complexity than that predicted by the theoretical worst case <ref> [3] </ref>. 4 Applications of the approach 4.1 View computation A view around a point is deoned by the extremities of the set of segments going through this point. <p> For each vertex swept we link all the kfaces incident to this vertex. The algorithm presented is O (n 4 log n), but experience in the oeld of discontinuity meshing and backprojections has shown that the cost can be much reduced thanks to accelerations techniques <ref> [3] </ref>; the number of EEE actually considered is usually far less than n 3 . 6 Conclusions We have presented a new approach for visibility computation and described a powerful datastructure which encapsulates all the visibility information in a 3D scene.
