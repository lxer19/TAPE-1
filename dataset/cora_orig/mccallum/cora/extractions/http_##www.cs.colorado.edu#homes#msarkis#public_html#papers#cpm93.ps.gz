Title: TWO-LEVEL SCHWARZ METHODS FOR NONCONFORMING FINITE ELEMENTS AND DISCONTINUOUS COEFFICIENTS  
Author: Marcus Sarkis

Affiliation: Courant Institute  
Abstract: Two-level domain decomposition methods are developed for a simple nonconforming approximation of second order elliptic problems. A bound is established for the condition number of these iterative methods, which grows only logarithmically with the number of degrees of freedom in each subregion. This bound holds for two and three dimensions and is independent of jumps in the value of the coefficients.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION The purpose of this paper is to develop a domain decomposition methods for second order elliptic partial differential equations approximated by a simple nonconforming finite element method, the nonconforming P 1 elements. We consider a variant of a two-level additive Schwarz method introduced in 1987 by Dryja and Widlund <ref> [1] </ref> for a conforming case. In these methods, a preconditioner is constructed from the restriction of the given elliptic problem to overlapping subregions into which the given region has been decomposed.

Reference-contexts: In addition, in order to enhance the convergence rate, the preconditioner includes a coarse mesh component of relatively modest dimension. The construction of this component is the most interesting part of the work. Here we have been able to draw on earlier multilevel studies, cf. Brenner <ref> [2] </ref>, Oswald [3], as well as on recent work by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund [4]. Our main result shows that the condition number of our iterative methods is bounded by C (1 + log (H=h), where H and h are the mesh sizes of the global and local problems, respectively.

This gives the partition of the unity introduced by Dryja, Smith, and Widlund <ref> [4] </ref>. The energy semi norm of u H is of order H. Let i1 H u H ( i ).

Reference-contexts: We introduce a partition of as follows. In a first step, we divide the region into nonoverlapping triangular substructures i ; i = 1; ; N: Adopting common assumptions in finite element theory, cf. Ciarlet <ref> [9] </ref>, all substructures are assumed shape regular, quasi uniform and not to have dead points, i.e. each interior edge is the intersection of the boundaries of two triangular regions. <p> Before studying the stability properties of this operator, we need two lemmas for the piecewise linear conforming finite element space. The following lemma is a Poincare-Friedrichs inequality. The idea of the proof can be found in Ciarlet (Theorem 6:1) <ref> [9] </ref> and in Necas (Chapter 2.7.2) [15].

The proof of this theorem is essentially the same as in the case of a conforming space; see Dryja and Widlund <ref> [12] </ref>. As we have seen before, the upper bound is very easy to obtain. The lower bound is obtained by using Lemma 2. We partition the finite element function u 2 V h as follows. <p> The bounds follow by using the stability results of Theorem 1 or 2. For the case of small overlap, the proof is similar to that of the case of piecewise linear conforming space considered in Dryja and Widlund <ref> [12] </ref>. Acknowledgments.
