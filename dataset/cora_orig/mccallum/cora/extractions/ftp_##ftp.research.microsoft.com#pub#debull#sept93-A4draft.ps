Reference-contexts: Object-Store is a fully object-oriented database system in the sense of the OODB Manifesto <ref> [1] </ref>. This covers in particular the basic database functionalities, including transaction management and indexing. Some of these functionalities have been adapted and extended for a more efficient management of spatial data.

Reference-contexts: modules, including a C/C++ program interface, a UNIX command interface and a graphical user interface based on the X Window System and OSF/Motif In the sequel we discuss those four layers in turn. 2.1 OODB and Kernel The GODOT kernel is implemented directly on top of the commercial OODB ObjectStore <ref> [2] </ref>. Object-Store is a fully object-oriented database system in the sense of the OODB Manifesto [1].

Reference-contexts: This may concern features such as query language standards, graphical tools, transaction management, and distributed processing. Earlier related work was mostly based on OODB research prototypes, such as PROBE <ref> [3] </ref> or O 2 [6]. Several other projects were based on extensible database systems, such as DASDBS [7], or POSTGRES [5].

For the implementation of the C/C++ program interface, the recommendations of the Object Management Group with regard to the Object Request Broker <ref> [4] </ref> will be taken into account. 3 Data Model The GODOT data model is partitioned into three categories of objects: 1. Thematic objects are used to represent real-world objects. An important subcategory of thematic objects are the geographic objects or geo-objects.

Thematic objects are used to represent real-world objects. An important subcategory of thematic objects are the geographic objects or geo-objects.
