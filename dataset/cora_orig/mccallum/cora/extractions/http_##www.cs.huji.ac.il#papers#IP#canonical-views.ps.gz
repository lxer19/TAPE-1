Abstract: We develop the concepts of view stability and likelihood for general objects. These quantities permit a quantitative characterization of the ability of a two dimensional view, or image, to represent a three dimensional object. Given objects with salient points, we provide explicit expressions from which the stability and likelihood of any image of a general object can be computed using its three second moments. To identify canonical (or representative) views, we show that the "flattest" view of the object is both the most stable and the most likely view. Given smooth objects, we first discuss image comparison, arguing for comparison via interest points (defined as points of high curvature on the occluding contour). Prior to measuring image stability and likelihood, we characterize points on surfaces of smooth objects by measuring the "number" of viewpoints from which they approximately ap pear as points of interest (if any).

Reference-contexts: The first question that we address is how to compare the images of such objects, or the question of curve comparison. Attneave <ref> [ Attneave, 1954 ] </ref> (and many others since) suggested to segment a curve at "interest points", which are points of maximum curvature along the contour.

Reference-contexts: Another common way to quantify the quality of the recognition of a certain object from a given image is via a measure of stability, or how much the image changes as the viewpoint of the object is perturbed (e.g., <ref> [ Binford and Levitt, 1993 ] </ref> ). This measure does not depend on a prior conditional distribution of viewpoints. The idea is that the less stable an image is to small perturbations of the viewing position, the less robust the recognition of the object from the image is.

Reference-contexts: We foresee its application mostly to object recognition. The qualitative analysis identifies the most stable views of an object, which are the most suitable views to be used as the object's characteristic (or canonical) views in viewer-centered approaches to object recognition (e.g., <ref> [ Chakravarty and Freeman, 1982 ] </ref> )). The quantitative characterization of images can be used for Bayesian image understanding (e.g., [ Freeman, 1993 ] ), or for the addition of quantitative characterization to a qualitative shape description, the aspect graph.

Reference-contexts: The quantitative characterization of images can be used for Bayesian image understanding (e.g., <ref> [ Freeman, 1993 ] </ref> ), or for the addition of quantitative characterization to a qualitative shape description, the aspect graph. The aspect graph is a coarse partition up to topological transformations of the different 2D views of a 3D object [ Koenderink and van Doorn, 1979 ] .

Reference-contexts: In the flattest view, its three central moments are a = 1; b = 1; c = 0:25 (they are not all 1). The flattest view of this object is shown in Fig. 1. the flattest view of an opaque cube. 3.1 Quantitative characterization of views In <ref> [ Weinshall et al., 1994 ] </ref> we developed the expressions for likelihood and stability of views, as a function defined over the viewing sphere. We obtained closed-form expressions that made it possible to instantly obtain and plot these functions for every given object. <p> Note that this is a result, and not an assumption, of our analysis. The simplicity implied in this result made it possible for us to develop explicit expressions for the stability and likelihood functions <ref> [ Weinshall et al., 1994 ] </ref> .
