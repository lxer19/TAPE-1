Reference-contexts: Although the complexity of the problem is reduced, it still involves a summation over all possible realizations of x (m; n). Geiger and Girosi <ref> [4] </ref> proposed using the saddle point approximation. This method is based on neglecting the statistical fluctuations of the field and considering only the contribution of the maximum term to the summation.

Reference-contexts: However, if the edge occurs at the block boundary, the cost is increased by scaling it by (1 + b) 1. Computing the mean of an MRF requires a summation over all possible realizations of the MRF. Therefore, computing Efx (m; n)g is exponentially complex and computa-tionally nonfeasible <ref> [6] </ref>. Zhang [6] used MFT to approximate the summation. <p> Computing the mean of an MRF requires a summation over all possible realizations of the MRF.

Mean field theory approximates this summation by assuming that the influence of f (k; l), where (k; l) 6= (m; n), can be approximated by Eff (k; l)g and the influences of h (k; l) and v (k; l) by their means.

Reference-contexts: EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The proposed algorithm has been tested on synthetic and real images. Figure 2 (a) shows a 256 fi 256 Shepp-Logan phantom. The ellipses are as described in <ref> [7] </ref>. The intensities of the small ellipses are in 25% and 75% increments instead of 1% and 2% as described in [7]. Afterwards, the phantom is corrupted by Poisson noise, as shown in Figure 2 (b). The image is then compressed using the JPEG compression standard, Figure 2 (c). <p> Figure 2 (a) shows a 256 fi 256 Shepp-Logan phantom. The ellipses are as described in <ref> [7] </ref>.
