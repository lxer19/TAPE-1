Reference-contexts: Block-matching motion compensation is combined with DCT transform coding of residuals in hybrid video coding systems such as H.261 (also known informally as the p fi 64 standard) <ref> [1, 8] </ref> and MPEG [2]. In previous work on motion compensation for video coding, motion vectors are chosen to minimize prediction error, and this task is often separated from other components of the video coding system that control the rate and distortion. <p> The PVRG coder uses this approach. The quantization step size Q is determined from the buffer fullness B F using the equation: Q = min (b80B F + 1c; 31); where Q has a integral range of <ref> [1; 31] </ref>, B F has a real-valued range of [0; 1]. This feedback function is plotted in Figure 3. 4 Explicit Minimization Algorithms In this section, we describe and compare the performance of three coders which conform to the p fi 64 standard. <p> The PVRG coder uses this approach. The quantization step size Q is determined from the buffer fullness B F using the equation: Q = min (b80B F + 1c; 31); where Q has a integral range of [1; 31], B F has a real-valued range of <ref> [0; 1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We have thus far only investigated a limited number of functional forms for the heuristic function H. These were suggested by visual examination of the histograms; however, perhaps some sort of theoretical analysis would suggest alternative forms. Another possibility would be to use techniques from nonparametric statistics (see <ref> [3] </ref>), where one estimates a functional relationship without choosing a form for the hypothesis a priori, instead implicitly using smoothness assumptions on the relationship to be modelled.

Reference-contexts: The upcoming H.263 standard is similar enough to H.261 that it seems clear that these methods will work well with the H.263 standard. An example of the use of the techniques of this paper in a coder where the motion field is encoded using a quadtree is described in <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The most popular method for estimating these motion vectors originated with Jain and Jain <ref> [6] </ref> and is called block-matching. In their approach, the current frame is divided into blocks (usually 8 fi 8 or 16fi 16) whose pixels are assigned the same motion vector.

Reference-contexts: To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work investigating the effect of minimizing codelength subject to quality constraints (implicit and explicit) to choose motion vectors, although the importance of coding motion vectors at very low bitrates is acknowledged in <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 Overview of the P fi 64 Standard We first provide a brief overview of key components of the p fi 64 standard. The p fi 64 standard specifies a three-component color system as the format for the video data.

Reference-contexts: Using block-matching, we create only a crude, but concise, model of the motion. For video coding, we do not necessarily want to find the "correct" motion vectors, in contrast to a goal of research in optic flow, for example <ref> [9] </ref>. If a motion vector field that does not correspond to the actual motion in the scene yields the shortest description, that is sufficient for purposes of compression.
