Reference-contexts: Therefore no event verification mechanism is required either. This paper presents a formal justification for adding this decommitment feature into a contracting protocol. In [23] we presented an example protocol that uses this feature. Principles for assessing decommitment penalties have been studied in law <ref> [1, 16] </ref>, but the purpose has been to assess a penalty on the agent that has breached the contract after the breach has occurred.

Reference-contexts: This was possible, because the agents were not self-interested: the contractee did not mind losing part of its effort without a monetary compensation. Similarly, the role of decom-mitment possibilities among cooperative agents has been studied in meeting scheduling using a contracting approach [24] and in cooperative coordination protocols <ref> [2] </ref>. Again, the agents did not require a monetary compensation for their efforts: an agent agreed to cancel a contract merely based on the fact that some other agent wanted to decommit. This research was descriptive: what will happen if agents use certain externally specified strategies.

Reference-contexts: Somewhat unintuitively, it turns out that the mere existence of a decommitment possibility in a contract can increase each agent's expected payoff. To discuss these issues more specifically, some concepts from microeco-nomics are introduced. First, social welfare measures the sum of the agents' payoffs <ref> [7, 4] </ref>. It is a measure of how good the payoffs are to the society of agents: it does not measure distribution aspects. Pareto efficiency measures both the societal goodness of a solution and distribution aspects [7, 4]. <p> First, social welfare measures the sum of the agents' payoffs <ref> [7, 4] </ref>.

The contractor tries to minimize the contract price that it has to pay in the contract.

Reference-contexts: Some normative research in game theory has focused on utilizing the potential provided by probabilistically known future events by contingency contracts among self-interested agents <ref> [17] </ref>. The obligations of the contract are made contingent on future events. There are games in which this method provides an expected payoff increase to both parties of the contract compared to any full commitment contract.

Each contract specifies a decommitment penalty for both agents involved.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, many multiagent systems consisting of cooperative agents incorporate some form of decommitment possibility in order to allow the agents to accommodate new events.
