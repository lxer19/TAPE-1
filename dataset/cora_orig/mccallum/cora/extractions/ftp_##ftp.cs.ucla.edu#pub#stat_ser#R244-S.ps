Abstract: When Can We Give Causal Interpretation Abstract The assumptions underlying statistical estimation are of fundamentally different character from the causal assumptions that underly structural equation models (SEM). The differences have been blurred through the years for the lack of a mathematical notation capable of distinguishing causal from equational relationships. Recent advances in graphical methods provide formal explication of these differences, and are destined to have profound impact on SEM's practice and philosophy.

Cartwright, a renowned philosopher of science, raises a related question: "Why can we assume that we can read off causes, including causal order, from the parameters in equations whose exogenous variables are uncorrelated?"

The latter has no operational significance worthy of the phrase "effect of x." This error was noted by Sobel (1990) but, perhaps because autonomy was presented as a new and extraneous assumption, Sobel's correction has not brought about a shift in practice or philosophy. 3 information.
