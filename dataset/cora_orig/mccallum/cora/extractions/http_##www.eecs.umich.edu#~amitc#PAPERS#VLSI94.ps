Abstract: We present a multi-terminal routing algorithm for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The routing problem for the FPGAs is difficult due to the preplaced routing segments that can be connected only by the pre-existing switches. We describe a sequential router that routes multi-terminal nets in a single stage, i.e., global routing is not required. The multi-terminal routing greatly reduces the total wire length as the multi-terminal tree approximates the steiner tree as opposed to a minimum cost spanning tree. Our router requires very small channel width. In addition, our router places an upper bound on the worst case delay by routing a multi-terminal net within its bounding box. Within the bounding box each terminal is routed in a distance that is less than or equal to the max(l(i;o)), where o is an output pin, i is an input pin, and l(i;o) is the Manhattan distance between an input and output pin. Our router has generated excellent routing results for some of the industrial circuits.

Reference-contexts: The flexibility of an S box, F s , is defined as the number of segments to which a wiring segment entering a S box can be connected. This LCA architecture is very similar to the one used in <ref> [1] </ref> and we have used the same terminology for F c and F s . The flexibilities of C and S boxes are shown in figure 2.

Reference-contexts: The segments can be connected using programmable switches for making long connections or for introducing bends. The predefined routing architecture makes the detailed routing problem for FPGAs far more difficult than the traditional detailed routing [7, 4]. Brown et. al. <ref> [2] </ref> have developed a detailed router for LCAs that routes the two-terminal nets within their assigned global routes. The router, known as the Coarse Graph Expansion (CGE) router, expands the global route (coarse graph) of each net to find a detailed route. <p> These circuits are from different sources: Bell Northern Research (BNR) , Zymos and two different designers at University of Toronto (UTD1 & UTD2). The idea behind routing these particular circuits was to compare with the results of the CGE router <ref> [2] </ref>. The CGE router [2] is a detailed router only and so an adaptation of LocusRoute global routing algorithm [5] has been used by Brown et. al. for global routing of the circuits in [2]. <p> These circuits are from different sources: Bell Northern Research (BNR) , Zymos and two different designers at University of Toronto (UTD1 & UTD2).

This channel density is compared with the density obtained after global routing by a modified version of the LocusRoute global router [5] as stated in <ref> [2] </ref>. As seen from the table, the channel density obtained by our router is almost the same as that reported by Brown et. al. [2].
