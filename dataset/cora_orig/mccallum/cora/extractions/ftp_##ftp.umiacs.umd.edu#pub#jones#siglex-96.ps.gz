Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of large-scale acquisition of computational-semantic lexicons from machine-readable resources. We describe semantic filters designed to reduce the number of incorrect assignments (i.e., improve precision) made by a purely syntactic technique. We demonstrate that it is possible to use these filters to build broad-coverage lexicons with minimal effort, at a depth of knowledge that lies at the syntax-semantics interface. We report on our results of disambiguating the verbs in the semantic filters by adding WordNet 1 sense annotations. We then show the results of our classification on unknown words and we evaluate these results.

Reference-contexts: Others who have taken a more knowledge-based (in-terlingual) approach (Lonsdale, Mitamura, and Nyberg, 1996) do not provide a means for systematically deriving the relation between surface syntactic structures and their underlying semantic representations. Those who have taken more argument structures into account, e.g., <ref> (Copestake et al., 1995) </ref>, do not take full advantage of the systematic relation between syntax and semantics during lexical acquisition. 1 We used Version 1.5 of WordNet, available at http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn.

Reference-contexts: Our results clearly indicate that the resolution of polysemy is a key component to developing an effective semantic filter. 2 Verb Classification Based on Syntactic Behavior We build on the syntactic filter approach of <ref> (Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg, 1995) </ref>, in which verbs were automatically classified into semantic classes using syntactic encodings in LDOCE. <p> A better measure of the efficacy of the algorithm would be to examine the ratio of correct assignments to the total number of assignments. The algorithm in <ref> (Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg, 1995) </ref> is correct only 13% of the time (1812 correct assignments out of 13761 total assignments) if given up to 5 assignments per verb. <p> Precision, on the other hand, is the number of correct categorizations that the algorithm gives divided by the total number of categorizations that it gave. In these terms, the algorithm in <ref> (Dorr, Garman, and Weinberg, 1995) </ref> achieves a recall of 67.7%, but a precision of 6.5% if given up to 15 semantic class assignments per verb.

Reference-contexts: This earlier approach produced a ranked assignment of verbs to the semantic classes from <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> based on syntactic tests (e.g., whether a verb occurs in a dative construction such as Mary gave John the book ). 2 The syntactic approach alone was demonstrated to classify Levin verbs with 47% accuracy (i.e., 1812 correct verb classifications out of 3851 possible assignments). <p> In addition to low precision, the purely syntactic filter described above was tested only on verbs that are in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> and it did not take into account the problem of multiple word senses. The remainder of this paper describes the formulation and refinement of semantic filters that increases the precision of this earlier experiment, while extending the coverage to novel verbs (i.e., ones not occurring in (Levin, 1993)) and <p> are in <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> and it did not take into account the problem of multiple word senses. The remainder of this paper describes the formulation and refinement of semantic filters that increases the precision of this earlier experiment, while extending the coverage to novel verbs (i.e., ones not occurring in (Levin, 1993)) and addressing the polysemy problem. 3 Semantic Filter: Increasing Precision We take as our starting point 7767 LDOCE verbs, approximately 5000 of which do not occur in Levin's classes.

Reference-contexts: We borrow terminology from Information Filtering (see, e.g., <ref> (Lewis, 1992) </ref>) to characterize these results. In particular, Recall is the number of correct categorizations the algorithm gives divided by the number of correct categorizations already given in the database.

Reference-contexts: We adopt the central thesis of Levin (1993), i.e., that the semantic class of a verb and its syntactic behavior are predictably related. We base our work on a correlation between semantic classes and patterns of grammar codes in the Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) <ref> (Procter, 1978) </ref>. We extend this work by coupling the syntax-semantics relation with a pre-defined association between WordNet (Miller, 1985) word senses and Levin's verbs in order to group the full set of LDOCE verbs into semantic classes.
