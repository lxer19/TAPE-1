Reference-contexts: He applied traditional Hoare-style proof methods without explicitly modeling concurrency. Assertions were expressed as global invariants and there was no attempt to modularize the proof. Bochmann attempted to construct mixed models comprised of both finite state machine components and programming language components <ref> [Bochmann 77] </ref>. In this way, it should be possible to verify safety properties using assertion techniques and some liveness properties using state exploration techniques. Tradeoffs along these lines were explored. Kroghdal used Simula to model service primitives for a link-level protocol [Kroghdal 78].
