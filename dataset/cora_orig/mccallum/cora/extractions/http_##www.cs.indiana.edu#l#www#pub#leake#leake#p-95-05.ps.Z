Abstract: Experience plays an important role in the development of human expertise. One computational model of how experience affects expertise is provided by research on case-based reasoning, which examines how stored cases encapsulating traces of specific prior problem-solving episodes can be retrieved and re-applied to facilitate new problem-solving. Much progress has been made in methods for accessing relevant cases, and case-based reasoning is receiving wide acceptance both as a technology for developing intelligent systems and as a cognitive model of a human reasoning process. However, one important aspect of case-based reasoning remains poorly understood: the process by which retrieved cases are adapted to fit new situations. The difficulty of encoding effective adaptation rules by hand is widely recognized as a serious impediment to the development of fully autonomous case-based reasoning systems. Consequently, an important question is how case-based reasoning systems might learn to improve their expertise at case adaptation. We present a framework for acquiring this expertise by using a combination of general adaptation rules, introspective reasoning, and case-based reasoning about the case adaptation task itself.

Reference-contexts: One method is to simply acquire them from human domain experts, either directly as adaptation cases (Berger, 1995) or by an interactive process in which the user is queried for needed information <ref> (Bell, Kedar, & Bareiss, 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In order to use case-based case adaptation, however, we must account not only for how adaptation cases are used but how an initial library of cases is acquired. One method is to simply acquire them from human domain experts, either directly as adaptation cases <ref> (Berger, 1995) </ref> or by an interactive process in which the user is queried for needed information (Bell, Kedar, & Bareiss, 1994).

Reference-contexts: It has also been observed that expertise is sometimes implicitly equated with experience, as in the novice/expert dichotomy often proposed by psychological studies <ref> (Campbell, Brown, & DiBello, 1992) </ref>. This paper focuses on the relationship between performance and experience: how expert level performance develops from problem-solving experience. Case-based reasoning (CBR) (e.g., Kolodner, 1993a; Riesbeck & Schank, 1989) is a paradigm that models the role of experience in refining problem-solving ability.

Reference-contexts: A few CBR systems have limited capabilities for learning to refine their adaptation capabilities. For example, the case-based planner CHEF <ref> (Hammond, 1989) </ref> has a static library of domain-independent plan repair strategies, and augments that library with learned ingredient critics for suggesting adaptations appropriate to particular ingredients. However, more general methods are needed.

Reference-contexts: In our framework, the memory search process transforms queries (Kolodner, 1984) using an introspective planning process involving internal mental operators <ref> (Hunter, 1990) </ref> describing how to search for information, such as to find a cause for an actor's state, search for an action performed by the actor that could cause that state (Leake, 1993, 1994). <p> Rule-based adaptation: Based on the problem type, the system selects a transformation (e.g., substitution), and generates a knowledge goal (Leake & Ram, 1993; Ram, 1987) for the information needed for the transformation. Introspective planning <ref> (Hunter, 1990) </ref> is done to search for the needed information, re-using any applicable memory search cases generated for pre vious adaptation problems. 3.

Reference-contexts: For example, if part of a retrieved case does not apply, substituting an alternative depends on finding that alternative, which depends on identifying the type of information that is needed and then reasoning introspectively about how it might be retrieved. In our framework, the memory search process transforms queries <ref> (Kolodner, 1984) </ref> using an introspective planning process involving internal mental operators (Hunter, 1990) describing how to search for information, such as to find a cause for an actor's state, search for an action performed by the actor that could cause that state (Leake, 1993, 1994).

Reference-contexts: Although much progress has been made in methods for case retrieval, case adaptation remains poorly understood. The problems with endowing case-based reasoning systems with automatic case adaptation are so acute that leaders in the field have often argued for postponing the inclusion of adaptation components in current CBR applications <ref> (e.g., Kolodner, 1991) </ref>. We are addressing the problem of acquiring case adap tation knowledge by developing methods for learning case adaptation from experience.

However, experience alone does not fully account for expert performance: People with comparable levels of experience may exhibit very different levels of skill (e.g., Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1993; Ericsson & Smith, 1991; Lesgold, Rubinson, Feltovitch, Glaser, Klopfer, & Wang, 1988).
