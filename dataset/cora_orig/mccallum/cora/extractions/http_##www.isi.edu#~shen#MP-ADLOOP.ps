Abstract: The "too-box" approach to data mining puts high-demands on human users, which limits its applicability. This paper presents a metapattern-based automated discovery loop which allows both "autonomous" and "human controlled" discoveries. An implemented system, DataCrystal, has been successfully applied to several real-world databases, which shows its promise.

Reference-contexts: Based on this observation, systems have been developed to include all these components. For example, systems such as INLEN [2] and IMACS <ref> [1] </ref> concentrate on inductive learning methods and the use of human knowledge. Systems such as KDW [3] and RECON [8] connect tightly with databases and provide a set of inductive and deductive tools for humans to choose from.

Reference-contexts: The deductive part of DataCrystal contains a metapattern instantiator and a deductive database technology called LDL++ <ref> [9] </ref> . The instantiator generates a set of LDL++ rules from a metapattern. These rules are then used by LDL++ to access various types of relational databases. The inductive part of DataCrystal includes a set of inductive data analysis tools that implement the above metap-attern actions and a pattern constructor.
