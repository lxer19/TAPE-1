Abstract: We introduce the notion of natural proof. We argue that the known proofs of lower bounds on the complexity of explicit Boolean functions in non-monotone models fall within our definition of natural. We show based on a hardness assumption that natural proofs can't prove super-polynomial lower bounds for general circuits. Without the hardness assumption, we are able to show that they can't prove exponential lower bounds (for general circuits) for the discrete logarithm problem. We show that the weaker class of AC 0 -natural proofs which is sufficient to prove the parity lower bounds of Furst, Saxe, and Sipser, Yao, and Hastad is inherently incapable of proving the bounds of Razborov and Smolensky. We give some formal evidence that natural proofs are indeed natural by showing that every formal complexity measure which can prove super-polynomial lower bounds for a single function, can do so for almost all functions, which is one of the two requirements of a natural proof in our sense.

Reference-contexts: AC 0 lower bounds for parity: AC 0 -natural One of the first combinatorial arguments to give people hope and direction in lower bound research was [11] where it was shown that P ARIT Y 62 AC 0 (independently this result, 7 using somewhat different machinery, was discovered in <ref> [1] </ref>). Substantial technical im-provements to their bounds were subsequently given by [40, 14]. All these proofs are AC 0 -natural. <p> B p;g (x) was shown in [9] to be a hard bit of the discrete logarithm problem. We consider B p;g (x) as a Boolean function in dlog pe variables (extended by, say, zeros on those inputs x which do not represent an integer in the range <ref> [1; p 1] </ref>). Our principal goal in this section is to show that no P=poly-natural proof against "sufficiently large" Boolean circuits can be applied to B p;g (x). To explain the meaning of "sufficiently large", we need a couple of technical definitions.

For any integer d, there exists a family G n;s F n , where s is a seed of size polynomial in n such that G n;s 2 AC 0 <ref> [2] </ref> and G n;s looks random for 2 O (n) -size depth-d circuits, i.e., for any polynomial-size (in 2 n ) depth d circuit family C n : F n ! f0; 1g, jP [C n (f n ) = 1] P [C n (G n;s ) = 1]j &lt; 2 <p> There is no lower bound proof which is AC 0 -natural against AC 0 <ref> [2] </ref>. Proof. Assume, on the contrary, that such a proof exists, and that C n has the same meaning as in the proof of Theorem 4.1. Let d be the depth of a size 2 O (n) circuit to compute C n . <p> Let d be the depth of a size 2 O (n) circuit to compute C n . Let G n;s be the generator which is pseudo-random against depth-d 2 O (n) - sized circuits from Theorem 4.2. From the definition of a proof natural against AC 0 <ref> [2] </ref>, for sufficiently large n, C n (G n;s ) = 0. Now, (4) immediately contradicts the largeness condition.

Reference-contexts: Our results have nothing to say one way or the other concerning the future promise of diagonalization and counting arguments. Another exception to our scheme is the list of strong lower bounds proofs against monotone circuit models <ref> [2, 3, 4, 17, 26, 27, 28, 37] </ref>. Here the issue is not constructivity the properties used in these proofs are all feasible but that there appears to be no good formal analogue of the largeness condition. <p> We will outline a special case of his argument: 8 a proof that parity does not have small AC 0 <ref> [3] </ref> circuits. First, we recall the notion of polynomial approximation of a Boolean function. Think of the Boolean value TRUE as corresponding to the field element 1 and the Boolean value FALSE as corresponding to the field element 1. <p> Proof outline: Smolensky's proof has two main pieces. (1) Any function computed by a "small" AC 0 <ref> [3] </ref> circuit can be "reasonably" approximated by a "low" degree polynomial over Z 3 . (2) The parity function in n variables can't be "reasonably" approximated by a "low" degree polynomial over Z 3 . <p> Part (1) of Smolensky's argument proves that C n is useful against AC 0 <ref> [3] </ref>. Why is C n natural? To see it we have to make a choice of C fl n . The simple choice is C fl n = C n . It is fairly obvious that C fl n satisfies the largeness condition.

Reference-contexts: This poses no problem for us since counting arguments (closely associated with diagonalization arguments) have yet not proved any lower bounds for explicit functions (except when counting is used for limited purposes, as in <ref> [36, 5] </ref>. These examples perfectly fit our general framework see Sections 3.2.1, 3.4.) The question of whether (unlimited) counting or diagonalization arguments are sufficiently powerful to resolve barrier problems in complexity theory predates the combinatorial style lower bounds of the 1980s. <p> Since 2 H (1=20) &lt; 19 20 , the proof is completed by the standard counting argument. 3.4. Lower bounds on formula size: AC 0 -natural Andreev <ref> [5] </ref> gives a promising lower bound for the formula size of an explicit function. His bound was subsequently improved in [23, 24]. Finally, H-astad [15] gave a nearly optimal lower bound (almost n 3 ) of the formula size for Andreev's function.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, it perfectly illustrates the general empirical idea of "adjusting" C n in both directions in order to come up with a natural C fl n . 3.3. Perceptron lower bounds for parity: P -natural In <ref> [6] </ref>, it is shown that a small constant-depth circuit (over f^; _; :g) which is allowed a single majority gate can't approximate the parity function. The authors did this by first showing tight lower bound on the degree of a perceptron required to approximate parity to within a given *. <p> The authors did this by first showing tight lower bound on the degree of a perceptron required to approximate parity to within a given *. Their argument is natural. Some definitions from <ref> [6] </ref>. A real polynomial p strongly represents a Boolean function 2 f just in case sgn (p (x)) = f (x) for all input vectors x; such a polynomial is also called a perceptron to compute f . <p> To see that C n is natural one must exhibit a proper subset C fl n . n (f n ) = 1 if d w (f n ) is greater than the appropriate threshold. <ref> [6] </ref> explicitly showed that C fl n (f n ) = 1 implies that a polynomial must have appropriately high degree to approximate f n with its sign, i.e., C fl n (f n ) = 1 implies that C n (f n ) = 1. d w is computable in <p> from f1; 1g n to f1; 1g, and fg stands for the point-wise product, which is the same as f g in the f0; 1g-notation 11 To argue that C fl n has the largeness property, we can show the following improvement of an (n= log n) lower bound from <ref> [6] </ref>: Theorem 3.1.

Reference-contexts: Another way to answer this question is to demonstrate that known methods are inher ently too weak to solve problems such as P ? = NP . This approach was taken in Baker, Gill, and Solovay <ref> [7] </ref>, who used oracle separation results for many major complexity classes to argue that relativizing proof techniques could not solve these problems. Since relativizing proof techniques involving diagonalization and simulation were the only available tools at the time of their work, progress along known lines was ruled out.

Reference-contexts: We show without using any cryptographic assumption that AC 0 -natural proofs, which are sufficient to prove the parity lower bounds of [11, 40, 14], are inherently incapable of proving the bounds for AC 0 [q]-circuits of <ref> [29, 36, 8] </ref>. One application of natural proofs was given in [33]. It was shown there that in certain fragments of Bounded Arithmetic any proof of super-polynomial lower bounds for general circuits would naturalize, i.e., could be recast as a natural proof. <p> Output the AND of all these circuits. The resulting circuit has depth 3 and is polynomial-sized in 2 n . 3.2. AC 0 [q] lower bounds: N C 2 -natural In this subsection we look at the proofs from <ref> [29, 36, 8] </ref> of lower bounds on the size of AC 0 [q]-circuits, q being a power of a prime. The naturalness of these proofs is especially transparent in the framework of [29]. <p> Smolensky's proof [36] is analyzed below. We will show in Section 4 that there is no AC 0 -natural proof against AC 0 [2]. Along with the previous subsection, this gives the insight that <ref> [29, 36, 8] </ref> had to require arguments from a stronger class than those of [11, 40, 14]. 3.2.1. Smolensky's proof: a non-trivial example of naturalization The argument given in Smolensky [36] is a perfect example of a natural circuit lower bound proof, but this is not immediately obvious.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, it would violate the fairly widely believed conjecture that there exist pseudo-random generators of hardness 2 n * , for some * &gt; 0 (e.g., the standard generator based on the discrete logarithm function <ref> [9] </ref> is believed to be 2 n 1=3 -hard). <p> a pseudo-random generator G k : f0; 1g k ! f0; 1g 2k define its hardness H (G k ) as the minimal S for which there exists a circuit C of size S such that jP [C (G k (x)) = 1] P [C (y) = 1]j S (cf. <ref> [9] </ref>). Here, as usual, x is taken at random from f0; 1g k , and y is taken at random from f0; 1g 2k . Theorem 4.1. <p> The key point is that the discrete logarithm is known to be hard on average if and only if it is hard in the worst case. In this section, we show that there is no natural proof that the discrete logarithm requires exponential-sized circuits. 17 Recall from <ref> [9] </ref> that for a prime p and a generator g for Z fl p , the predicate B p;g (x) on Z fl p is defined to be 1 if log g x (p1)=2 and 0 otherwise. B p;g (x) was shown in [9] to be a hard bit of the <p> logarithm requires exponential-sized circuits. 17 Recall from <ref> [9] </ref> that for a prime p and a generator g for Z fl p , the predicate B p;g (x) on Z fl p is defined to be 1 if log g x (p1)=2 and 0 otherwise.

We consider B p;g (x) as a Boolean function in dlog pe variables (extended by, say, zeros on those inputs x which do not represent an integer in the range [1; p 1]). <p> W.l.o.g. we may assume that this is the case for our original sequence.

Reference-contexts: Let C fl n C n satisfy the constructivity and largeness conditions. W.l.o.g. we may assume from the very beginning that C fl n = C n . We use a slightly modified construction from <ref> [12] </ref>. Let G k : f0; 1g k ! f0; 1g 2k be a polynomial time computable pseudo-random generator, and * &gt; 0 be an arbitrary constant. Set n = dk * e. <p> Set n = dk * e. We use G : f0; 1g k ! f0; 1g 2k for constructing a pseudo-random function generator f : f0; 1g k ! F n in the same way as in <ref> [12] </ref>. Namely, let G 0 ; G 1 : f0; 1g k ! f0; 1g k be the first and the last k bits of G, respectively. <p> Constructing from this a statistical test for strings in our case is even simpler than in <ref> [12] </ref>. Namely, we arrange all internal nodes of the binary tree T of height n: v 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v (2 n 1) in such a way that if v i is a son of v j then i &lt; j.

Reference-contexts: The fact that C fl 2n has largeness is easy to prove. Con structivity is also easy if we observe that there are only 2 O (n) formulas of size less than n= log n. 3.5.

Reference-contexts: The assumption that 2 n * -hard functions exist is quite plausible. For example, despite many advances in computational number theory, multiplication seems to provide a basis for a family of such functions (known factoring algorithms are sufficiently exponential). Based upon lower bounds for the parity function, Nisan <ref> [22] </ref> constructed a very strong generator secure against AC 0 -attack. In fact, an easy analysis of his generator in terms of its own complexity gives the following: Theorem 4.2.

Reference-contexts: This is in T C 0 . 3.6. Lower bounds against switching-and-rectifier networks: AC 0 -natural It was shown in <ref> [30] </ref> that any switching-and-rectifier network (in particular, any nondeterministic branching program) for a large variety of symmetric functions must have size (nff (n)), where ff (n) is a function which slowly grows to infinity.

It was shown there that in certain fragments of Bounded Arithmetic any proof of super-polynomial lower bounds for general circuits would naturalize, i.e., could be recast as a natural proof. <p> We are unaware of a lower bound proof for which we cannot exhibit a C fl n which is P -natural with density close to one. For most known arguments, can be restricted to N C 2 or lower. Our full negative result (strengthened by an observation of Razborov <ref> [33] </ref>) is that, under our pseudo-randomness assumption, no property with =quasi-polynomial-sized circuits, fl = P=poly, and ffi n = 2 O (n) can exist. Thus, our negative result rules out proofs with much more inclusive parameters than currently known circuit lower bounds. 3. Examples of naturalizing arguments 3.1. <p> This observation is of little importance for the examples of natural proofs given in this paper. However, it is useful in the context of proofs feasible in the logical sense <ref> [33] </ref>, where quasi-polynomial limitations on the complexity arise more often. Formally, we define ~ P =qpoly as the class of non-uniform, quasi-polynomial size circuits, i.e., size n log n O (1) . Theorem 4.4.
