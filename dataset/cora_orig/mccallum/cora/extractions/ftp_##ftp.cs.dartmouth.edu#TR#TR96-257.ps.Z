Abstract: Video and audio compression techniques allow continuous media streams to be transmitted at bit rates that are a function of the delivered quality of service. Digital networks will be increasingly used for the transmission of such continuous media streams. This paper describes an admission control policy in which the quality of service is negotiated at stream initiation, and is a function of both the desired quality of service and the available bandwidth resources. The advantage of this approach is the ability to robustly service large numbers of users, while providing increased quality of service during low usage periods. Several simple algorithms for implementing this policy are described and evaluated using queuing model analysis applied to video-on-demand. The queuing model results are compared with simulation results to validate their accuracy. Revised March 25, 1996 to include discrete event simulation results.

Reference-contexts: Before a stream is initiated the user's receiver negotiates a fixed bandwidth with the network, and the capacity allocated to this stream is fixed for its duration (the reservationist model of ATM networks <ref> [And93, Lan94, Mil94] </ref>). It should be noted that this general problem applies not only to bandwidth allocation in a transmission network, but is also applicable to disk or I/O channel capacity allocation within a multimedia server [RC95].

Reference-contexts: These results are derived from <ref> [BM95] </ref>. Steady state here implies two things: 1. The arrival of stream requests is a random process (e.g., Poisson) with a stationary distribution with respect to time, as are the stream durations; 2. <p> The amount of guard bandwidth can be selected by choosing f () appropriately. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the various algorithms under low and high usage situations (excluding saturation). 5 QUEUING ANALYSIS 9 5 Queuing Analysis Simulation results for simple algorithms presented earlier (Section 2), are well documented <ref> [BM95] </ref>. Simulation gives a good insight into the performance of a system but is not a good tool for understanding system internals. One of the tools employed frequently for gaining insights into system dynamics is queuing analysis.

Reference-contexts: This is distinct from the problem of enforcement once a QOS contract has been negotiated [Jul94, SS94]. As an example to give representative numbers, the network might be a fiber-optic ATM network with a data rate of 622 Mbit/s, serving up to 250 video-on-demand users in a fiber-to-the-curb configuration <ref> [Bru94] </ref>. Each stream is a digitized NTSC video signal with 500 lines of vertical resolution and 300 lines of horizontal resolution, at 30 frames per second, and 8 bits of luminance and 1 bit of color information per pixel, for an uncompressed data rate of 40.5 Mbit/s.
