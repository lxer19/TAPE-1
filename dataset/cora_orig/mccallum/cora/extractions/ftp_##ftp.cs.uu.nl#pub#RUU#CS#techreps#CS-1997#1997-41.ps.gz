Title: Computing Fence Designs for Orienting Parts  
Author: Robert-Paul Berretty yz Ken Goldberg Mark H. Overmars A. Frank van der Stappen 
Abstract: A common task in automated manufacturing processes is to orient parts prior to assembly. We consider sensorless orientation of a polygonal part by a sequence of fences. We show that any polygonal part can be oriented by a sequence of fences placed along a conveyor belt, thereby settling a conjecture by Wiegley et al. [17], and present the first polynomial-time algorithm to compute the shortest such sequence. The algorithm is easy to implement and runs in time O(n 3 log n), where n is the number of vertices of the part.

The motion of the belt effectively turns each slide into a push action by the fence in the direction normal to the fence. <p> We now transform this constraint on the push direction relative to the belt into a constraint on successive push directions relative to the part. Sliding along a fence f i causes one of P 's edges e to align with the fence. The curved tip of the fence <ref> [5] </ref> guarantees that e is aligned with the belt sides as P leaves the fence. If f i is a left fence then e faces the left belt side (see Figure 3). If f i is a right fence, it faces the right side.

Reference-contexts: The input is a description of the part shape and the output is a sequence of open-loop actions that moves a part from an unknown initial pose into a unique final pose. Among the sensorless part feeders considered in literature are the parallel-jaw gripper <ref> [6, 9] </ref>, a single pushing jaw [2, 10, 11, 13], a conveyor belt with a sequence of (stationary) fences placed along its sides [5, 14, 17], a conveyor belt with a single rotational fence (1JOC) [1], a tilting tray [8, 12], and vibratory plates and programmable vector fields [3, 4]. <p> Such a sequence is referred to as a push plan. Goldberg [9] showed that any polygonal part can be oriented by a sequence of pushes. Chen and Ierardi <ref> [6] </ref> proved that any polygonal part with n vertices can be oriented by O (n) pushes. They showed that this bound is tight by constructing (pathological) n-gons that require (n) pushes to be oriented. Goldberg gave an algorithm for computing the shortest push plan for a polygon. <p> We prove that for these asymmetric parts a fence design always exists and has length O (n). In Section 5 we deal with parts that are not asymmetric. Chen and Ierardi <ref> [6] </ref> use a sequence of equivalent basic actions to orient a polygonal part P with a unique longest right environment r (a) of length ff. <p> In a similar manner, we could use reorientations by (fi ), and obtain the sequence (fi + ) m+1 , where fi is the length of the longest left environment. The observation that m = O (n) leads to the result of Lemma 4.1. Lemma 4.1 <ref> [6] </ref> A polygonal part P with n vertices can be oriented by N = O (n) pushes. In order for the push plan (ff) m+1 or (fi +) m+1 to be a valid fence design, we have to show that it satisfies the constraints formulated in Definition 2.2. <p> The plans can actually be used to orient any part up to the period in its push function. The method we use is similar to the method Chen and Ierardi introduced to generate push plans <ref> [6] </ref>. Recall that a fence design is a push plan satisfying constraints on the reorientations of the jaw. We will try to produce push plans that only use reorientations in either (0; =2) or (=2; 0), as such plans clearly satisfy Definition 2.2. <p> For a push plan Lemma 4.1 remains valid <ref> [6, 16] </ref>. For fences this is not necessarily the case. <p> Different classes of push functions lead to different reduces. 12 The objective is to use these building blocks in a push plan that is guaranteed to result in an interval of possible orientations of measure zero. According to the `stretching lemma' of Chen and Ierardi <ref> [6] </ref>, any interval [v; w]; v 6= w of possible orientations can be mapped onto a shorter interval of possible orientations [v 0 ; w 0 ] by a single push. <p> In words, with a valid reorientation of the jaw, we can map any possible orientation onto any angle in the angular intervals between the long right environments. Chen and Ierardi show in Lemma 2.4 of their paper <ref> [6] </ref> that there is a reorientation of the jaw for which one orientation, say p v is mapped onto a left environment, and another orientation p w is mapped onto a right environment. The third orientation p z is mapped either on a left or a right environment. <p> The intervals between the large right intervals, B 1 and B 2 , have exactly the same size we construct a fence design as follows: Since the push function has period 2, Lemma 2.4 of Chen and Ierardi's paper <ref> [6] </ref> gives us that there has to be a pair of orientations (at least one between the orientations with the large right environments), reachable with one push in angular interval ( 2 ; ) by a right fence, such that the distance between p 1 and v 1 is not equal

Reference-contexts: A breadth-first search of the graph takes O (n 3 ) time (see e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>). This yields the following theorem. Theorem 3.4 The computation of the optimal fence design for a polygonal part P with n vertices takes O (n 3 log n) time. Let t be a path in the graph from the source to the sink. <p> The costs make it impossible to apply Lemma 3.2 to reduce the graph size, as this may cause the removal of equally long or longer paths with lower cost from the graph. The size of the resulting graph is therefore O (n 4 ). Dijkstra's algorithm (see e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>) has been used to find the minimal cost path through the graph in time O (n 4 ). 4 The existence of fence designs for asymmetric parts In this section we concentrate on parts with push functions with a unique longest left environment l (a) and a unique longest right

If pushing does change the orientation, then this rotation changes the orientation of the pushing device relative to the part.

Wiegley et al. <ref> [17] </ref> conjectured that a fence design exists for any polygonal part. They gave an exponential algorithm for computing the shortest sequence of fences for a given part. In this paper, we prove the conjecture that a fence design exists for any polygonal part. <p> The table shows that the type of fence f i imposes a bound on the reorientation ff i+1 . Application of the same analysis to fences f i1 and f i and reorientation ff i leads to the following definition of a valid fence design <ref> [17] </ref>. <p> We simply pick the midpoint of every such interval as the reorientation, and get a push plan which is a fence design. We can easily compute the fence angles from the reorientation angles on the path, using the properties of the fence framework <ref> [17] </ref>. 3.2 Implementation We implemented the described algorithm to test its behavior in practice. This turned out to be rather easy, using only some basic geometric computations for the push function, and some standard graph algorithms.
