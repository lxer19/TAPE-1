Abstract: The paper concerns the probabilistic evaluation of plans in the presence of unmeasured variables, each plan consisting of several concurrent or sequential actions. We establish a graphical criterion for recognizing when the effects of a given plan can be predicted from passive observations on measured variables only. When the criterion is satisfied, a closed-form expression is provided for the probability that the plan will achieve a specified goal.

Reference-contexts: First, some of the potential confounders are unobservable (e.g., U 1 ), so they cannot be conditioned on. Second, some of the confounders (e.g., Z) are affected by the control variables and, one of the deadliest sins in the design of statistical experiments <ref> [Cox 1958, page 48] </ref> is to stratify on such variables. The sin being that stratification simulates holding a variable constant, but holding constant a variable that stands between an action and its consequence prevents us from obtaining an accurate reading on the unmediated effect of that action.

Reference-contexts: In Spirtes et al. (1993) and later in Pearl (1993b), for example, it was shown how causal networks can be used to facilitate quantitative predictions of the effects of interventions, including interventions that were not contemplated during the network's construction.
