Reference-contexts: For this reason, barycentric coordinates for simplices and various extensions to other types of polytopes appear in the finite element literature [Wac75]. The Bernstein-Bezier representation of polynomial functions <ref> [Far88] </ref> also relies on barycentric coordinates. Given a simplex, barycentric coordinates span the space of linear functions over that simplex. Higher degree basis functions over that simplex can be constructed by applying the multinomial theorem to the sum of the basis functions.

Reference-contexts: At a conceptual level, its proof is similar to that of Stokes' theorem <ref> [Fle77] </ref> in which the integral over an object is related to an integral over the boundary of the object. In this case, the object is the cone C. The adjoint of C is defined as a sum involving the adjoints of simplicial cones triangulating C.

Reference-contexts: A face of P is the intersection of P and a supporting hyperplane for P . If P has dimension d, then the facets of P are the (d 1)-dimensional faces of P . The edges and vertices of P are faces of dimension one and zero, respectively. Grunbaum <ref> [Gru67] </ref> contains a complete exposition of the theory of convex polytopes. The convex hull of a set of rays emanating from the origin is a polyhedral cone (with apex at the origin).

Reference-contexts: Several others have investigated this problem in the case of convex polygons. Wachspress [Wac75] defines barycentric finite element basis functions for convex m-gons. These functions are rational and of degree m 2. Wachspress also generalizes this construction to special types of polyhedra. Loop and DeRose <ref> [LD89] </ref> independently develop similar functions for defining multi-sided surface patches used in Computer-Aided Geometric Design. In the case of general convex polytopes, Lee [Lee89] has developed non-rational basis functions that are non-negative and have linear precision.

In this paper, we focus on building rational basis functions that are barycentric for arbitrary convex polytopes. The next section reviews some of the properties of convex polytopes and polyhedral cones in particular.

Reference-contexts: The Delaunay triangulation of a convex polytope is a well-known example of a triangulation. <ref> [PS85] </ref> is good source for more material on triangulations. 3.2 A definition of adjoints If S is a simplicial cone, then let a S denote the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the vertex rays in v (S).

Loop and DeRose [LD89] independently develop similar functions for defining multi-sided surface patches used in Computer-Aided Geometric Design. <p> Since the degree of this function decreases by one for each of the jf (C)j 1 jf (F )j facets in the second category, the degree of b w (x) d (x) restricted to (v x = 0) is exactly jf (F )j dim (F ). 2 Wachspress <ref> [Wac75] </ref> first introduced the notion of adjoints in his construction of finite element bases for convex m-gons. Given a convex m-gon P , the m lines bounding P intersect in exactly (m)(m1) 2 points (including points at infinity); m of these points are vertices of P .
