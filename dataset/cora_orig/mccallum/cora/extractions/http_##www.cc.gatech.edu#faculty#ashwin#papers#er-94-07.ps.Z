Abstract: In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for designing indices for educational hypermedia systems. In this theory, we argue that the design of these systems and their and indices are best thought of in terms of "cognitive media types." Specifically, we argue that systems should not be characterized primarily in terms of the kinds of physical media types that can be accessed. Instead, the important aspect is the content that can be represented within a physical media, rather than the physical media itself. Cognitive media are based on a cognitive theory of the inferential and learning processes of human users, and encapsulate different methods or strategies for problem solving and learning. These strategies rely on specific media characteristics that facilitate specific problem solving actions, which in turn are enabled by specific kinds of physical media.

Reference-contexts: For example, figures (or diagrammatic representations) can facilitate spatial inferences (Larkin & Simon 1987) Thus, media types can be classified based on "cognitive" distinctions that depend not on physical characteristics of media but on the reasoning processes of users. For example, consider the following example from Boden <ref> (Boden 1991) </ref>. A 20-foot rope is tied to and hanging between two buildings that are some distance apart.

Reference-contexts: For example, zooming is a particular problem solving action|more precisely, a particular schema for a problem solving action which results in certain inferences|whereas at the higher level one might have schemas for problem solving strategies as a whole. So, for example, one may resort to case-based reasoning <ref> (Kolodner 1993) </ref>, go back to first principles using basic definitions and equations, or reason using constructive simulations (Soloway et al. 1992). A case is a type of media (characterized at the cognitive level) that facilitates the former (case-based reasoning) problem solving strategy.

Reference-contexts: This means that the learner can choose to view text, video, sound, etc. However, research that compares learning from different media types are inconclusive in showing advantages of one physical medium over another. Research on what kinds of media types and materials facilitate learning is confusing and contradictory <ref> (Kozma 1991) </ref>. The lack of conclusive evidence demonstrating the superiority of one physical media over another reflects the fact that many factors, above and beyond simple media, affect a student's learning process. <p> The point is that a type of physical media|here, a diagram|can affect the course of problem solving by facilitating certain kinds of inferences and making others harder. At the next level are the media characteristics <ref> (Kozma 1991) </ref>. These are a characterization of the kinds of problem-solving actions that people might perform during a task.

Reference-contexts: Although often distinguished based on perceptual modalities (for example, visual vs. aural), they may be also characterized by the types of inferences that they facilitate. For example, figures (or diagrammatic representations) can facilitate spatial inferences <ref> (Larkin & Simon 1987) </ref> Thus, media types can be classified based on "cognitive" distinctions that depend not on physical characteristics of media but on the reasoning processes of users. For example, consider the following example from Boden (Boden 1991).

Reference-contexts: In the next section, we present our theory of cognitive media types. We then describe an educational system that we are building within a hypermedia authoring environment, called MMEDS <ref> (Li, Gallant, & Stasko 1994) </ref>. This system will be used to evaluate our theory and to determine general guidelines for the design of hypermedia learning environments. Cognitive Media Types In our theory, multimedia information can be thought of as composed of three layers. <p> These tools enable the author to create, organize and synchronize educational information within an open and extensible architecture. Authored course modules utilize a hypermedia, networked organizational model and support the presentation of text, audio, still graphics, animations, and other arbitrary programs <ref> (Li, Gallant, & Stasko 1994) </ref>. Using the MMEDS authoring environment, we are designing an educational module targeted for introductory computer science and engineering classes. The module, called AlgoNet, will allow students with minimal background to learn about basic algorithm concepts, such as graphs and sorting.

Reference-contexts: So, for example, one may resort to case-based reasoning (Kolodner 1993), go back to first principles using basic definitions and equations, or reason using constructive simulations <ref> (Soloway et al. 1992) </ref>. A case is a type of media (characterized at the cognitive level) that facilitates the former (case-based reasoning) problem solving strategy. <p> Zooming in and adaptation are specific problem solving actions that are facilitated by different media characteristics; these characteristics, in turn, are enabled by specific physical media. To take another example, consider Emile, a multimedia environment in which subjects learn physics by constructing physics simulations <ref> (Soloway et al. 1992) </ref>. While the physical media characteristics| animations|are similar to those of many other animation-based learning environments, the crucial difference lies in the reasoning processes used by the student|here, constructive experimentation rather than passive observation.
