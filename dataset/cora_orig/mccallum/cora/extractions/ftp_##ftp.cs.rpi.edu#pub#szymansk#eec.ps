Abstract: Disease can influence a host population's dynamics directly or indirectly through effects on the host's interactions with competitors and exploiters. We present a stochastic, spatially explicit model for the epidemiological landscape of a vector-borne disease. Two host species, of unequal competitive strength, are attacked by a selective parasite; the parasite serves as a vector for a pathogen. We emphasize the importance of the ecological stencil, the local area where ecological interactions govern a site's species composition. We point out how parallel computing can efficiently employ the geometry of the stencil's local transitions to predict large-scale spatio-temporal patterns of the model community. Spatial heterogeneity in abiotic factors and biotic processes often generates patterns in population dynamics and the resulting attributes of ecological communities. Despite a long-standing recognition of the significance of spatial variation, analytical and computational models of spatially explicit, multispecies interactions have only recently influenced community theory (e.g. Hastings, 1990; Kareiva, 1990). We develop a spatially explicit model for the epidemiological landscape of a vector-borne disease. We focus on the "ecological stencil", the local area where ecological interactions govern the species composition at any specific location. Simulation of the local transition probabilities defining the stencil will predict large-scale spatio-temporal patterns of the model community. We first mention a few examples of vector-borne disease. Then we present a model for the dispersal-mortality dynamics of two competing host species, a pathogen that infects the hosts, and a parasite (on the hosts) that serves as a vector for the pathogen. Using a simplified version of the model, we show how variation in the size of the ecological stencil can influence "quasi-stationary" abundances of species competing in a probabilistic density-dependent manner. We briefly comment on the computational requirements for implementing the model efficiently (e.g. Sinharoy and Szymanski, 1993). We outline a series of applications of the model; these include spatially explicit analyses of ecological dispersal, the spread of an epidemic, and cultural diffusion of information. Finally, we consider how our model might provide spatial representations of evolutionary processes. Pathogens can influence a host's birth and death rates directly (e.g. Anderson, 1991), or indirectly through effects on the host's interactions with competitors and exploiters (e.g. Hochberg et al., 1990; Schall, in press). Ecological models of epidemics generally assume that a pathogen is directly transmitted when an infective host

Reference-contexts: The initial condition of the environment E is described by the vector N 0 . The state space S of the vectors N t is defined as S = ~ 1 fi ~2::: fi ~ J . The function : S 7! <ref> [0; 1] </ref> is a random field if at every time t, The random field is a distribution assigning state probabilities. <p> Parasitism can be interpreted as contact (of random duration) between nearby individuals in our version of the simple epidemic. If we add pathogen loss to the simple epidemic, our model becomes a spatially explicit general epidemic, since infected hosts can recover from disease (e.g. <ref> [1] </ref>). By extending the set of states ~ k , we could treat recovered hosts as immmune, or less susceptible, to pathogenic infection. One-dimensional epidemic models (diffusions; e.g. Murray and Steward, 1992) suggest that the frequency of the immune class affects the spatial propagation of disease.

Reference-contexts: Extinction versus dynamic equilibrium Extinction of various species constitutes an absorbing barrier. Although extinction is the ultimate equilibrium configuration of the system, the time to reach absorption can grow very large for J &gt;> 1 (see e.g., <ref> [8] </ref>). Consequently, extinction need not be a serious problem for realistic dispersal/mortality probabilities. Furthermore, we can solve for positive, quasi-stationary equilibria (see Sharma et al. 1982) to explore some biological predictions of our model.

Reference-contexts: If distance strongly governed dispersal, a more realistic model might assume that the probability of advancing from site l to site k decreases with each intermediate site traversed. Geometrically decaying dispersal offers a reasonable model for this decrease (e.g. <ref> [16] </ref>). That is, we could write p hr (l; k) = p hr w kl for w &lt; 1.
