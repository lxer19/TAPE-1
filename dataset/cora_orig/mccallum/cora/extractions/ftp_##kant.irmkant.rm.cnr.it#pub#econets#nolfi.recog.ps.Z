Reference-contexts: Most of the work done in behavior-based robotics focuses on the process of breaking down the desired behavior into an appropriate set of behavioral modules and in (a) the design of a coordination technique powerful enough to produce the correct integration of the designed sub-behaviors <ref> (Brooks, 1991) </ref> or (b) the attempt to design the behavioral modules in such a way as to allow them to freely cooperate or compete to achieve a coherent behavior without the need of a coordination structure (Steels, 1994).

Reference-contexts: We believe that both these approaches are insufficient and that the process of breaking down the required behavior into subcomponents should be the result of an adaptation process and not of a decision of the experimenter <ref> (see also Dorigo and Schnepf, 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This approach does not require the required behavior to be broken down into subcomponents because the complete solution of the task is expected to emerge during the evolutionary process. Evolutionary Robotics approaches are based on the genetic algorithm technique <ref> (Holland, 1975) </ref>. An initial population of different "genotypes", each codifying the control system (and possibly the morphology) of a robot are created randomly.

Reference-contexts: The problem Having at our disposal a Khepera robot we decided to try to develop a control system for such a robot that could to distinguish between objects with different shapes. Khepera (Figure 1) is a miniature mobile robot developed at E.P.F.L. in Lausanne, Switzerland <ref> (Mondada, Franzi, and Ienne, 1993) </ref>. It has a circular shape with a diameter of 55 mm, a height of 30 mm, and a weight of 70g. It is supported by two wheels and two small Teflon balls.

Reference-contexts: The robot has to distinguish between walls and target objects. In particular we want the robot to explore the environment, avoiding walls and remaining close to targets when it finds them. In order to train the robot we used a simulator of the robot and of the environment <ref> (see Nolfi, Floreano, Miglino, and Mondada, 1994) </ref>. However, we then tested the trained controller on the real robot in the real environment. A sampling procedure was used to calculate the activation state of the infrared sensors. <p> The robots that have obtained the highest fitness are then allowed to reproduce (sexually or agamically) by generating copies of their genotypes with the addition of random changes ("mutations"). The process is repeated for a certain number of generations until, hopefully, desired performances are achieved <ref> (for methodological information see Nolfi, Floreano, Miglino and Mondada, 1994) </ref>. To evolve neural controllers able to perform the task described in section 2 we used a form of genetic algorithm. We began with 100 randomly generated genotypes, each representing a network with a different set of randomly assigned connection weights.

Reference-contexts: For each architecture we ran 10 training processes starting with different randomly assigned initial weights. Networks were trained by backpropagation <ref> (Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams 1986) </ref> for 5000 epochs. A learning rate of 0.02 and no momentum were used.
