Title: Incrementally Evaluating Constrained Transitive Closure by Conjunctive Queries  
Author: Guozhu Dong 
Date: 14, 1994  
Note: July  
Abstract: Technical Report 94/11 Computer Science Department University of Melbourne Abstract Some recent work considered the incremental evaluation of Dat-alog queries, including the transitive closure query, using conjunctive queries after the insertion/deletion of one fact. In this paper we consider such incremental evaluation of constrained transitive closure queries for the insertion case. The constraints may refer to attributes such as heights and temporatures at interested spatial locations, and distances between these locations.
