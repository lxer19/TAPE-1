Abstract: In this paper, we describe situation calculus with aspect, which is an extension of the classical situation calculus. The new approach allows efficient representation of the frame axioms and partially ordered plans. In S.C. with aspect, fluents and actions are associated with aspects. The frame axioms are replaced by axioms that describe the interference relation between aspects. A plan is represented as multiple sequences of actions applied on different aspects. We believe that the new representation will improve the efficiency of logic based planners and facilitate the analysis of total order and partial order planning techniques.

Reference-contexts: Efficiency can be further improved by using a subset of first order logic, such as Horn clauses, or by using a specialized inference engine. There is still much active research in analyzing and comparing partial order planning techniques <ref> [MBD94, KKY95, BW94] </ref>. S.C. with aspect is also of interest in this respect. S.C. with aspect provides a first order logic representation of partially ordered plans. Since the representation is separated from the underlying inference engine, the search space can be analyzed without being tied to a specific search strategy.

Reference-contexts: Besides the efficiency in representing the frame axioms, aspects can also be used to represent partially ordered plans. Since the work of Sacerdoti [Sac74], there has been an active line of research on non-linear or partial order planning <ref> [Tat77, Cha87, Wel94] </ref>. The basic idea of nonlinear planning is that actions should not be ordered unless it is necessary to resolve conflictions. Non-linear planning is often generalized to the notion of least commitment planning, which also includes the postponement of variable instantiations. <p> However, it is commonly believed that partial order planning reduces the search space by avoiding unnecessary action permutations <ref> [Cha87, Wel94] </ref>. In this section, we extend situation calculus with aspect to represent partially ordered plans. We first introduce the techniques for S.C. with aspect using single level classification, then we generalize them to handle S.C. with aspect using hierarchical classification. <p> Although most analyses are based on STRIPS representations, a similar argument also applies to first order representations. We demonstrated in section 4 that S.C. with aspect indeed reduces the search space. Standard STRIPS representation <ref> [Cha87] </ref> and first order logic are two ends of a spectrum of planning representations with increasing expressiveness and decreasing efficiency. For many applications, standard STRIPS is inadequate. STRIPS can not represent actions with disjunctive goals or with universally quantified preconditions.

Reference-contexts: ones between fluents and actions 7 or equivalently :interfere (a A ; a result ) is true. 8 j is equivalent to applying ordered resolution to directmapping with interfere as the largest predicate. 9 resolution with paramodulation is a sound and complete strategy for first order logic with equality, see <ref> [CL73] </ref> for reference. 9 within one component. Inter-aspect relations are the ones between two different components. Intra-aspect relations include axioms corresponding to group (I)(II) and possibly part of group (III).

Reference-contexts: It is known that the plan space of a problem can often be much smaller than the state space. And many believe that partial order planning helps to eliminate redundant backtrackings and is in general more efficient than total order planning. Most non-linear planners use some extensions of STRIPS <ref> [FN71] </ref>, which was initially used as a representation language to avoid the frame axioms. Recent planners have added many extensions to the original STRIPS, including conditional effects, 2 universal quantification, etc [Wel94].

Reference-contexts: Using S.C. with aspect, we can efficiently represent the frame axioms and utilize partially ordered plans to reduce the search space in a logical framework.

In some sense, <ref> [Rei91] </ref> is similar to S.C. with aspect using direct mapping, where the explicit representation is mechanically derived from the effect axioms. S.C. with aspect with hierarchical classification allows a more flexible and often more efficient representation.
