Title: THE COMPOSITIONAL INTERPRETATION OF NOMINAL COMPOUNDS

Abstract: The analysis of nominal compound constructions has proven to be a recalcitrant problem for linguistic semantics and poses serious challenges for natural language processing systems. We argue for a compositional treatment of compound constructions which limits the need for listing of compounds in the lexicon. We argue that the development of a practical model of compound interpretation crucially depends on issues of lexicon design. The Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky 1995) provides us with a model of the lexicon which couples sufficiently expressive lexical semantic representations with mechanisms which capture the relationship between those representations and their syntactic expression. In our approach, the qualia structures of the nouns in a compound provide relational structure enabling compositional interpretation of the modification of the head noun by the modifying noun. This brings compound interpretation under the same rubric as other forms of composition in natural language, including argument selection, adjectival modification, and type coercion. We examine data from both English and Italian and develop analyses for both languages which use phrase structure schemata to account for the connections between lexical semantic representation and syntactic expression. In addition to applications in natural language understanding, machine translation, and generation, the model of compound interpretation developed here can be applied to multi-lingual information extraction tasks.

Reference-contexts: See Beard (1996) for an interesting account of why Italian favors the type of constructions illustrated in (1) above. 4 MICHAEL JOHNSTON AND FEDERICA BUSA 1.2. STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES IN ENGLISH AND ITALIAN In an earlier version of this work, <ref> (cf. Busa and Johnston, 1995) </ref>, we focussed on the role of the Italian preposition for disambiguation purposes and did not provide a further analysis of the structural properties of complex nom-inals. <p> Complex nomi-nals such as nominal compounds play an important role in the encapsulation The Compositional Interpretation of Nominal Compounds 17 and expression of nominal concepts and are frequent in a wide variety of types of texts <ref> (Johnston, Pustejovsky, and Boguraev 1995) </ref>. Therefore, the ability to handle complex nominals is essential for parsing and generation systems for either English or Italian. It is important to note that systems utilizing compositional apparatus for the analysis of complex nominals need not treat all compounds compositionally.

Reference-contexts: For instance, the compound bread knife refers to a knife which is used to cut bread, while lemon juice refers to juice which is obtained from squeezing lemons. Previous analyses were based on essentially descriptive methodologies <ref> (Levi 1978, Jones 1995) </ref>, relying on the enumeration of possible semantic relations observed in the language. The limitation of these approaches is that they can hardly be exhaustive, since they rely on uniquely descriptive machinery.

Reference-contexts: One approach to this task is to use the GL representation language essentially as an interlingua <ref> (McDonald 1995) </ref>. The phrase structure schemata for English are used in order to determine potential interpretations for a given English compound construction. The most likely interpretation from the candidate set is picked on the basis of contextual and statistical models.

Reference-contexts: Before turning to a more detail explanation of our account, the next section provides a brief sketch of this approach. The GL lexical representation is embedded within a simplified feature-based syntactic representation of syntax and semantics similar in some aspects to Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar <ref> (Pollard and Sag 1987,1994) </ref>. 2. The Generative Lexicon and Lexical Representation For the purposes of this paper, the lexical semantic representation we employ is a simplified form of the Generative Lexicon (GL) representation employed in Pustejovsky (1995). <p> Our approach is similar in spirit, but differs in its adoption of qualia structure as the vehicle for expression of the semantic relationships found in compounds. The combination of words into compound forms could also be captured using lexical rules <ref> (Flickinger 1987, Pollard and Sag 1987) </ref>. We have chosen to use phrase structure schemata rather than lexical rules on the basis of storage considerations. Each lexical rule used for compounds will license a great many modifiers for large number of potential heads.

Reference-contexts: Analysis of Compound Constructions In order to account for the availability of compound forms in both English and Italian, we utilize phrase structure schemata. These schemata are essentially the same kind of entity as the Immediate Dominance Schemata employed in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar <ref> (Pollard and Sag 1994) </ref>. They are schemata which license the availability of complex nominals, which we treat as phrasal signs. These schemata are essentially phrase structure rules. Compounds are licensed and interpreted as part of the process of parsing.
