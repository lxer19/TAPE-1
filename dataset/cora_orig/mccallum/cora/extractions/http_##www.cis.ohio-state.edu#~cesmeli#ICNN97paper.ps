Title: Abstract  
Abstract: An image segmentation method is proposed for texture analysis. The method is composed of two main parts. The first part determines a novel set of texture features based on Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF). Unlike other GMRF-based methods, our method is not limited by a fixed set of texture types. The second part is LEGION (Locally Excitatory Globally Inhibitory Oscillator Networks) which is a 2D array of neural oscillators. The coupling strengths between neighboring oscillators are calculated based on texture feature differences. When LEGION is simulated, the oscillators corresponding to the same texture tend to oscillate in synchrony, whereas different texture regions tend to attain different phases. Results demonstrating the success of our method on real texture images are provided.

Reference-contexts: Thus, unlike others, our approach is not limited by a fixed set of texture types. There are several methods for estimating GMRF parameters.

Reference-contexts: Selection of leader points and expansion of the regions are repeated until there is a preset number of points left unlabeled. Different labels for different regions correspond to different phases in LEGION. 4. Results To demonstrate the performance of our method, natural textures from the Brodatz Photography Album <ref> [2] </ref> and MIT Vision Texture Image Archive are used. We present three images of size containing different texture types. A second order Gaussian Markov Random Field is used to model the textures.

Reference-contexts: It is, therefore, natural to deduce that texture is a region property, not a point property. Accordingly, models have been proposed to capture features from a region of various sizes.

Model components 2.1 Markov random field MRF modeling has found several applications in texture processing, including texture synthesis, classification, and segmentation <ref> [8] </ref>. In MRF an image is represented by determining the local dependency structure of pixel intensities. The notion of locality is captured by means of a local conditional probability distribution. In a general framework of MRF, there are six basic steps. <p> After the parameters of MRF are estimated from the training data, a cost can be associated with each configuration. A measure of the cost is finally minimized with respect to image intensities or image attributes <ref> [8] </ref>. 2.1.1. Model description. If the structural form for the local conditional probability distribution in MRF is assumed to be Gaussian, the model is called Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF). The size and the topology of the local dependence are designated as the order of the model. <p> We adopt the least square estimate [1, 6] among other methods of estimation, because it is easy to compute <ref> [8] </ref>.
