Abstract: IP version 6 (IPv6) is being designed within the IETF as a replacement for the current version of the IP protocol used in the Internet (IPv4). We have designed protocol enhancements for IPv6, known as Mobile IPv6, that allow transparent routing of IPv6 packets to mobile nodes, taking advantage of the opportunities made possible by the design of a new version of IP. In Mobile IPv6, each mobile node is always identified by its home address, regardless of its current point of attachment to the Internet. While away from its home IP subnet, a mobile node is also associated with a care-of address, which indicates the mobile node's current location. Mobile IPv6 enables any IPv6 node to learn and cache the care-of address associated with a mobile node's home address, and then to send packets destined for the mobile node directly to it at this care-of address using an IPv6 Routing header.

Instead, a home agent must always use IPv6 encapsulation [6] for delivering intercepted packets to a mobile node.

Reference-contexts: Each time the mobile node moves its point of attachment from one IP subnet to another, the mobile node will configure its care-of address by stateless address autoconfiguration [30], or alternatively by some means of stateful address autoconfiguration such as DHCPv6 <ref> [4] </ref> or PPPv6 [9]. The decision about which manner of automatic address configuration to use is made according to the methods of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [19]. <p> These considerations obtain whether or not the mobile node has configured its care-of address with stateless address autoconfiguration, or by way of a stateful address allocation authority such as DHCPv6 <ref> [4] </ref>. If the previous address is allocated by such a stateful address server, then such a mobile node may not wish to release the address immediately upon acquisition of a new care-of address.

Reference-contexts: ICMP error messages contain as payload, a portion of the packet generating the error message. Whereas ICMP for IPv4 [25] generally returned only the first 8 bytes beyond the IP header of the packet generating the error, ICMP for IPv6 <ref> [5] </ref> returns as much of the original packet as will fit in the ICMP error message without causing the entire ICMP packet to exceed 576 bytes.

Reference-contexts: The home agent then intercepts any packets on the home subnet addressed to the mobile node's home address and tunnels them to the mobile node at its current care-of address. This tunneling uses IPv6 encapsulation <ref> [6] </ref>, and the path followed by a packet while it is encapsulated is known as a tunnel. <p> To tunnel the packet, the home agent encapsulates it using IPv6 encapsulation <ref> [6] </ref>. In addition, Mobile IPv6 provides a mechanism for IPv6 correspondent nodes communicating with a mobile node, to dynamically learn the mobile node's binding. <p> This tunneling is done using IPv6 encapsulation <ref> [6] </ref>, in the same way as packets tunneled from any home agent. <p> Instead, a home agent must always use IPv6 encapsulation <ref> [6] </ref> for delivering intercepted packets to a mobile node. When a home agent encapsulates a packet for delivery to the mobile node, the home agent uses the care-of address as the destination address in the outer IPv6 header, and uses its own address as the outer source address. <p> In order to return the ICMP error message to the original sender of the packet (the correspondent node), IPv6 has defined 9 tunneling using encapsulation to relay the ICMP error message to the original sender <ref> [6] </ref>. ICMP error messages contain as payload, a portion of the packet generating the error message.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper, we describe the design of a new protocol for transparent routing of IPv6 packets to mobile IPv6 nodes operating in the Internet [13]. IP is the protocol which provides packet routing and delivery services for the Internet, and IP version 6 (IPv6) <ref> [8] </ref> is a new version of IP intended to replace the current version of IP (IPv4) [26]. IPv6 is in the final stages of design within several working groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [11, 12], the principle standards development body for the Internet. <p> Once a correspondent node has learned the mobile node's care-of address, it may cache it and route its own packets for the mobile node directly there using an IPv6 Routing header <ref> [8] </ref>, bypassing the home agent completely. The most important function needed to support mobility is the reliable and timely notification of a mobile node's current care-of address to those other nodes that need it, in order to avoid the routing anomaly known as triangle routing, as illustrated in Figure 1. <p> Mobile IPv6 introduces a set of new IPv6 Destination options, called Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement, to manage these cache entries as needed. The Binding Update and Binding Acknowledgement options conform to an option mechanism already present in IPv6 <ref> [8] </ref>. Section 2 of this paper presents an overview of the important aspects of the operation of IPv6, and Section 3 presents an overview of the extensions for Mobile IPv6. <p> destination, a node checks its Binding Cache for an entry for the packet's destination address, and if a cached binding for this address is found, the node routes the packet directly to the mobile node at the care-of address indicated in this binding; this routing uses an IPv6 Routing header <ref> [8] </ref> instead of IPv6 encapsulation, as this adds less overhead to the size of the packet. (The home agent cannot use a Routing header, since adding one to the packet at the home agent would invalidate the authentication in any IPv6 Authentication header included in the packet by the correspondent node.) <p> In this case, the Next Header field in the Destination Options header is set to indicate No Next Header <ref> [8] </ref>. It is essential for scalability and minimizing network load that correspondent nodes be able to learn the care-of address of a mobile node, and that they cache this information for use in sending future packets to the mobile node's care-of address. <p> If, on the other hand, the correspondent node has a Binding Cache entry for the destination address of a packet it is sending, the correspondent node should send the packet directly to the care-of address indicated in the binding, using an IPv6 Routing header <ref> [8] </ref>. 8 To use the Routing header for delivery of a packet to a mobile node, the correspondent node lists the care-of address in the packet's IPv6 header as the destination address, and lists the mobile node's home address (the original destination address of the packet) in the Routing header as <p> the returned packet in the ICMP error message, and then to forward the modified ICMP message to the original sender of the packet causing the error (the correspondent node in this case). 9 Security Issues The IPv6 and IP Security specifications require authentication to be implemented by all IPv6 nodes <ref> [2, 8] </ref>. Thus, whenever a mobile node is able to establish a security association with a correspondent node, the mobile node will be able to send authenticated Binding Updates to that correspondent node.

Reference-contexts: Nodes on the same link can communicate with each other even without any routers, by using their Link-Local addresses. Nodes discover each other's presence, as well as each other's link-layer (i.e., MAC) addresses, by participating in the Neighbor Discovery protocol <ref> [19] </ref>; IPv6 nodes also discover local routers and network prefixes by means of Neighbor Discovery. The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery protocol can be characterized as a much improved version of two IPv4 protocols, the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) [23] and the ICMP Router Discovery Protocol [7]. <p> The decision about which manner of automatic address configuration to use is made according to the methods of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <ref> [19] </ref>. A mobile node may have more than one care-of address at a time, for example if it is link-level attached to more than one (wireless) network at a time or if more than one IP network prefix is present on a network to which it is attached. <p> While it has a home registration entry in its Binding Cache, the home agent uses proxy Neighbor Discovery <ref> [19] </ref> to intercept any IPv6 packets addressed to the mobile node's home address on the home subnet, and tunnels each intercepted packet to the mobile node's primary care-of address indicated in this Binding Cache entry. To tunnel the packet, the home agent encapsulates it using IPv6 encapsulation [6]. <p> The additional burden on IPv6 nodes or implementations due to this additional functionality is negligible, since the operation of the Binding Cache is quite similar to the existing IPv6 Destination Cache <ref> [19] </ref> in the node and can easily be integrated with it. Mobile IPv6 introduces two new IPv6 Destination options to allow a mobile node's home agent and correspondent nodes learn and cache the mobile node's binding. <p> In this case, the mobile node may also include the Link-Local address it used when last on its home network, to cause the home agent to send proxy Neighbor Advertisements <ref> [19] </ref> for this address as well as for the mobile node's home address; the mobile node must set the the Home Link-Local Address Present (L) bit to indicate that the Home-Link Local Address field has been included in the Binding Update. <p> The primary movement detection mechanism for Mobile IPv6 uses the facilities of the IPv6 Neigh 6 bor Discovery protocol, including Router Discovery and Neighbor Unreachability Detection. The description here is based on the conceptual model of the organization and data structures defined by Neighbor Discovery <ref> [19] </ref>. Mobile nodes use Router Discovery to discover new routers and on-link network prefixes; a mobile node may send Router Solicitation messages, or may wait for unsolicited (periodic) Router Advertisement messages, as specified for Router Discovery. <p> it must again perform IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection at the earliest pos sible moment after it has registered with its home agent. * A mobile node may send a Router Solicitation message to its home agent at any time, within the constraints imposed by rate control in IPv6 Neighbor Discovery <ref> [19] </ref>. 7 Correspondent Node Operation Every IPv6 node may at times be a correspondent node communicating with one or more mobile nodes. Thus, every IPv6 node must be able to process received Binding Updates, to send Binding Acknowledgements, and to maintain a Binding Cache. <p> soon as possible to its correspondent nodes. 8.2 Proxy Neighbor Advertisements When a mobile node first registers with its home agent after leaving its home subnet, the home agent must send onto the home subnet a gratuitous Neighbor Advertisement on behalf of the mobile node, with the Override flag set <ref> [19] </ref>, giving its own link-layer address as the associated link-layer address for the mobile node's IPv6 home address. <p> Each of these gratuitous Neighbor Advertisements should be repeated a few times to increase reliability, although any node that does not receive one of these Advertisements will be able to detect the change in the mobile node's link-layer address using IPv6 Neighbor Unreachability Detection <ref> [19] </ref>. In addition, while the mobile node is away from home, the home agent should act as a proxy for the mobile node, replying to any received Neighbor Solicitation messages received for the mobile node's home address or Link-Local address.

Reference-contexts: Each time the mobile node moves its point of attachment from one IP subnet to another, the mobile node will configure its care-of address by stateless address autoconfiguration <ref> [30] </ref>, or alternatively by some means of stateful address autoconfiguration such as DHCPv6 [4] or PPPv6 [9]. The decision about which manner of automatic address configuration to use is made according to the methods of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery [19].
