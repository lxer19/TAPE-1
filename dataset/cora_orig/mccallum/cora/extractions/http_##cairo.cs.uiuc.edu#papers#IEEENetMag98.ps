Abstract: The upcoming Gbps highspeed networks are expected to support a wide range of communication-intensive, real-time multimedia applications. The requirement for timely delivery of digitized audiovisual information raises new challenges for the next generation integrated-service broadband networks. One of the key issues is the Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing. It selects network routes with sufficient resources for the requested QoS parameters. The goal of routing solutions is twofold: (1) satisfying the QoS requirements for every admitted connection and (2) achieving the global efficiency in resource utilization. Many unicast/multicast QoS routing algorithms were published recently, and they work with a variety of QoS requirements and resource constraints. Overall, they can be partitioned into three broad classes: (1) source routing, (2) distributed routing and (3) hierarchical routing algorithms. In this paper we give an overview of the QoS routing problem as well as the existing solutions. We present the strengths and the weaknesses of different routing strategies and outline the challenges. We also discuss the basic algorithms in each class, classify and compare them, and point out possible future directions in the QoS routing area.

Reference-contexts: The performance of the algorithm is tunable by choosing the value of x. A larger x results in a larger probability of finding a feasible path and a larger overhead. Awerbuch et al. algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>: Awerbuch et al. proposed a throughput-competitive routing algorithm for bandwidth-constrained connections. The algorithm tries to maximize the amortized (average) throughput of the network over time. It combines the functions of admission control and routing. Every link is associated with a cost function that is exponential to the bandwidth utilization.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm achieves a throughput that is within O (log vT) factor of the highest possible throughput achieved by the best offline algorithm that is assumed to know all of the connection requests in advance. The competitive routing for connections with unknown duration was studied in <ref> [2] </ref>. A survey for the competitive routing algorithms was done by Plotkin [43]. Summary: All the above algorithms require a global state to be maintained at every node. Most algorithms transform the routing problem to a shortest path problem and then solve it by Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford algorithm.

Reference-contexts: An ancestor of a node is either its parent or an ancestor's parent. We have used the simplest topology aggregation, which abstracts a group by a single logical node. There are other types of aggregation using different simple topologies to replace a group. Their performance was studied in <ref> [3] </ref>. Each physical node maintains an aggregated network image. The image maintained at node A.a.1 is shown in Figure 3 (e). It stores different portions of the network in different details.

Reference-contexts: The other problem is called link-constrained routing. An example is the bandwidth-constrained routing, which is to find a path whose bottleneck bandwidth is above a required value. The link-optimization routing problem can be solved by a slightly modified Dijkstra's algorithm [16] or Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [6] </ref>. The link-constrained routing problem can be easily reduced to the link-optimization problem. For other QoS metrics such as delay, delay jitter and cost, the state of a path is determined by the combined state over all links on the path.

It was proved that a feasible path of the new problem must also be a feasible path of the original problem. The performance of the algorithm is tunable by choosing the value of x.

Probes (routing messages) are flooded from the source toward the destinations of a multicast group. Probes proceed only along the paths which lead to at least one destination and have sufficient resources to guarantee the end-toend QoS. <p> The probes in Chen-Nahrstedt algorithm are only allowed to be sent along the paths which have sufficient resources to support the required QoS <ref> [11] </ref>. Hence, a feasible path is determined when a probe reaches the multicast tree. The join-request messages in Carlberg-Crowcroft algorithm are sent along paths which may or may not have enough resources. Hence, multiple candidate paths are used. <p> Reducing the updating frequency does not solve the problem because the precision of the global state will decrease. Distributed and hierarchical algorithms offer solutions for the scalability problem. In particular, the distributed algorithm based on selective probing <ref> [11] </ref> uses only local states, and no shortest-path computation is conducted at a single node. The ticket-based probing algorithm [12] works with imprecise state information, which allows relatively infrequent state updates. The hierarchical routing provides a clean solution to the scalability problem. <p> The generic algorithm captures the common messaging and computational structure. Various concrete algorithms are derived from the generic algorithm by specifying the QoS-dependent open components <ref> [11] </ref>. Extensibility: As the network infrastructure evolves and the capacity increases, new applications are made possible. It requires the routing algorithms to adapt in order to accommodate new service types.

Reference-contexts: At the first iteration, probes are sent only along the shortest paths. If the first iteration fails, probes are allowed to be sent along paths with increasing lengths in the following iterations. Simulation shows that with two iterations Chen-Nahrstedt algorithm achieves substantial overhead reduction. 2) ticket-based probing <ref> [12] </ref> If every node maintains a global state, which is allowed to be imprecise, the ticket-based probing is used to improve the performance of selective probing. Certain number of tickets is issued at the source according to the contention level of network resources. <p> Distributed and hierarchical algorithms offer solutions for the scalability problem. In particular, the distributed algorithm based on selective probing [11] uses only local states, and no shortest-path computation is conducted at a single node. The ticket-based probing algorithm <ref> [12] </ref> works with imprecise state information, which allows relatively infrequent state updates. The hierarchical routing provides a clean solution to the scalability problem. It maintains an aggregate global state whose size is logarithmic to the network size if the (logical) nodes are clustered into groups with roughly uniform sizes.

Reference-contexts: That is the job of routing. While routing is decoupled from resource reservation in most existing schemes, some recent proposals combine routing and resource reservation in a single multi-path message pass from the source to the destination <ref> [13] </ref>. QoS routing and admission control: The task of admission control is to determine whether a connection request should be accepted or rejected. Once a request is accepted, the required resources must be guaranteed. The admission control is often considered as a byproduct of QoS routing and resource reservation. <p> Source O (xve) (3) Global Zero Wang-Crowcroft [56] Bandwidth-optimization r.

It was based on Deering's work <ref> [14] </ref>. In addition to a global state, the protocol maintains at every node the membership information of every multicast group in the routing domain. The group membership change in a subnetwork is detected by a local router, and that router broadcasts the information to all other nodes.

Reference-contexts: As the network topology is aggregated, the state information is aggregated as well. The state of each logical link is the combination of the states of many lower-level links. The link-state algorithm can be extended to collect the aggregated state information for every node <ref> [19] </ref>. As the state is aggregated, the imprecision is also aggregated. 4 Routing Problems The routing problems can be divided into two major classes: unicast routing and multicast routing. <p> The PNNI (Private Network-Network Interface) <ref> [19] </ref> standard for routing in ATM networks is also hierarchical. The hierarchical routing scales well because each node only maintains a partial global state where groups of nodes are aggregated into logical nodes. The size of such an aggregated state is logarithmic in the size of the complete global state. <p> Distributed O (v) Global O (v) Cidon et al. [13] Generic r.

(4) Shi-Chou algorithm and Chen-Nahrstedt's selective probing algorithm require only the local state to be maintained at each node. (5) Chen-Nahrstedt's iterative probing substantially reduces the routing overhead at the cost of longer routing time. 6.3 Hierarchical routing algorithms PNNI (Private Network-Network Interface) <ref> [19] </ref>: PNNI is a hierarchical linkstate routing protocol. Its hierarchical model has been discussed in Section 3. We uses an example to illustrate the routing process. The network in Figure 9 (a) has a two-level hierarchy with three groups. <p> Multipath routing can be used to increase the probability of accepting a connection under resource contention. There are two interpretations for multipath routing. One interpretation is to search multiple paths for a feasible one. PNNI <ref> [19] </ref> uses crankback to search multiple paths sequentially. When the selected path does not meet the requirement, the routing process is cranked back and resumes with an alternative path. This approach works well with network dynamics. The disadvantage is longer routing time.

Reference-contexts: Multiple constraints often make the routing problem intractable. For example, finding a feasible path with two independent path constraints is NP-complete <ref> [20] </ref>. Second, any future integrated-service network is likely to carry both QoS traffic and best-effort traffic, which makes the issue of performance optimization complicated. It is hard to determine the best operating point for both types of traffic if their distributions are independent.
