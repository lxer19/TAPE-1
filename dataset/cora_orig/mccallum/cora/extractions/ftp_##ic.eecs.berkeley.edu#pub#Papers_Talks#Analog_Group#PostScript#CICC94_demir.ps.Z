Title: Abstract  
Abstract: This paper presents behavioral simulation techniques for phase/delay-locked systems. Numerical simulation algorithms are compared and the issue of numerical noise is discussed. Behavioral phase noise simulation for phase/delay-locked systems is described. The role of behavioral simulation for phase/delay-locked systems in our top-down constraint-driven design methodology, and in bottom-up verification of designs, is explained with examples. Accuracy and efficiency comparisons with other methods are made. Simulation techniques are described in the framework of phase/delay-locked systems, but simulation methodology and the results attained in this work are applicable to the behavioral simulation of mixed-mode nonlinear dynamic systems.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, traditional simulators take too much time to compute the system behavior by simulating the whole system over the interval required by the analog circuits. When a system is originally conceived in our top-down con-straint-driven hierarchical design methodology <ref> [1] </ref>, the realization of the digital circuits, as well as the details of the analog circuits, have not been decided yet. So, an accurate circuit simulation is neither possible nor desired. <p> These are high-level mathematical representations of the components. They include differential equations, difference equations, transfer functions, statistical distributions, tables or arithmetic expressions <ref> [1] </ref>. Behavioral models which consist of these representations capture the input-output behavior of circuits, and they are independent of circuit architecture. They describe the first-order behavior of the circuit as well as the second-order analog effects in order to get a realistic idea of the performance of the overall system. <p> Designers can verify system design early, with behavioral models of system components, before investing time in detailed circuit implementation. Design space exploration can be done efficiently. In our top-down, constraint-driven design methodology <ref> [1] </ref>, given a set of circuit specifications (circuit characteristics, the design rules, the technology, and user options), a mapping is made to schematics or layout. Behavioral simulation and optimization are used for architecture selection.

Reference-contexts: The role of behavioral simulation for phase/delay-locked systems in our top-down constraint-driven design methodology is elucidated in Section 5. 2. Numerical Algorithms Behavioral models of circuit components such as voltage-con-trolled oscillators (VCOs), phase detectors (PDs), and phase/fre-quency detectors (PFDs) which operate only on timing information have already been developed <ref> [2] </ref>. These are high-level mathematical representations of the components. They include differential equations, difference equations, transfer functions, statistical distributions, tables or arithmetic expressions [1]. Behavioral models which consist of these representations capture the input-output behavior of circuits, and they are independent of circuit architecture. <p> For instance, the time-deriva-tive of instantaneous phase in a square wave VCO model is expressed as, where is the VCO control voltage, and is, in general, a nonlinear function relating the effective frequency of VCO to the control voltage <ref> [2] </ref>. The waveform at the output of the VCO is represented by zero crossings, which occur when takes values which are integer multiples of . <p> Any modeling or design methodology, and simulation tools, which do not address this problem are not suitable for high performance phase/delay-locked system design. The models we use in behavioral simulation include statistical second-order effects <ref> [2] </ref>. Analysis of a phase/delay-locked system in the presence of noise, when the system is not in lock, is a hard problem. <p> Linearity assumption might be validated for very low noise levels, but higher noise levels will excite the nonlinearities. For behavioral phase noise simulation, we use the full nonlinear models of the components, which are described in <ref> [2] </ref>. The method that is used for phase noise simulations is Monte Carlo in time domain. The CPU time disadvantage of the Monte Carlo method disappears because of the high efficiency of behavioral simulation.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction Phase-locked loops (PLLs) and delay-locked loops (DLLs) are an important part of the class of mixed-mode nonlinear dynamic systems which includes PLLs, DLLs, oversampling data converters, switching power supplies. PLLs and DLLs have many applications; they are used in receivers, clock generators <ref> [3] </ref>, clock recovery [4], data synchronization [5], etc. In general, mixed-mode nonlinear dynamic circuits are stiff systems. Traditional simulators such as SPICE spend large amounts of CPU time on computing the accurate waveforms of the digital circuits, yet the waveforms of the much slower analog circuits determine the system behavior.

Reference-contexts: First-order (linear) and second-order interpolation methods were implemented for estimation of the timing of switching events. The iterative method explained above, which can compute the timing of switching events to a desired accuracy, was also implemented. A behavioral model for a charge-pump PLL (Fig.3) <ref> [8] </ref>, which consists of a ring-oscillator VCO, a PFD, a charge-pump and a second-order loop filter, was built to analyze the behavior of the numerical algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The model parameters are extracted using SPICE from the transistor level description of components. Simulate the system in time-domain using the behavioral simu lator to calculate the performance measures. Behavioral simu-lation is much faster than circuit simulation. To illustrate this procedure, component behavioral models for a bipolar PLL <ref> [11] </ref> were set up, and behavioral simulation was used to analyze the acquisition characteristics. Fig. 6 shows SPICE domain extraction of the relation between the effective frequency of VCO and the control voltage ( in (1)). Other model parameters are extracted in a similar way from the transistor level description.
