Title: Evaluation and Reduction of Power Consumption in the Navigator Wearable Computer

Abstract: The increasing density of integrated circuits has made it possible to design computers which are small and lightweight enough to be mobile. Mobile computers have constraints that their desktop predecessors do not, especially in the domains of size, weight, and power. The power consumed by a mobile computer is a key constraint, because the power determines the battery capacity required, which is a major factor in the minimum volume and weight of the system. Power management can be performed at several levels, from the transistor level in hardware up to the application level in software. Designers of fully custom mobile computers can build in power controls at each level, resulting in a wide range of options for power management. Designers of semicustom mobile computers, using both off-the-shelf and custom components, often have fewer power management options open to them, depending upon the number of power management controls available in the off-the-shelf components. The Navigator 1 wearable computer was a semicustom design. This paper discusses the evaluation of subsystem power consumption, describes possible modifications for reducing power consumption, and classifies the modifications along three axes. Four modifications were implemented, resulting in a factor of 2.9 increase in battery life while the system is idle. Results are also presented for a simple equation to predict battery life based upon user activity.

Reference-contexts: But like laptop computers, they are battery powered, allowing them to move with the user without being tethered. The Engineering Design Research Center has designed and manufactured three generations of wearable computers, with two new generations under development <ref> [Cogswell 92, Siewiorek 93] </ref>. Teams of electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, software engineers, and industrial designers, working concurrently, have delivered a new wearable computer approximately every 8 months since 1991. Table 1 shows the battery weight and life for the three generations of wearable computers.

Reference-contexts: Letting P active = Energy/ BatteryLife active and P idle = Energy/BatteryLife idle , and rearranging, The above equation is the same as Amdahls Law <ref> [Hennessy 90] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The timer decrements every 5 seconds when enabled and resets to its initial value every time the drive is accessed. The power management commands and their effects are given in Table 6 <ref> [Integral 92] </ref>. The power management commands which initialize the timer (E2, E3) greatly simplify the software for putting the disk in standby mode. Without them, the software would have to monitor disk activity and send an E0 command whenever the disk should be shut down.

Reference-contexts: Hdsetstat () handles I/O control operations, such as setting drive parameters, hdstart () initiates the drive I/O request at the front of the current queue, and hdintr () services the drive interrupts. Chapter 8 of <ref> [Lefer 89] </ref> gives a more detailed description of the interaction of these routines.

Reference-contexts: Even desktop computer designers are facing tighter power constraints, after the EPA found that computers account for 5% of the U.S. commercial electrical demand and initiated the Energy Star program to encourage power conservation in the computer industry <ref> [Nadel 93] </ref>. Designers in these domains would also benefit from having a method for evaluating and reducing system power consumption. This paper is a case study in the evaluation and reduction of power consumption in a computer system. Section 2 presents the initial evaluation of power consumption of Navigator.
