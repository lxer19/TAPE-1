Abstract: In this paper we present an algorithm which automatically extracts geopositional coordinate index terms from text to support georeferenced document indexing and retrieval. Under this algorithm, words and phrases containing geographic place names or characteristics are extracted from a text document and used as input to database functions which use spatial reasoning to approximate statistically the geoposition being referenced in the text. We conclude with a discussion of preliminary results and future work.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Georeferenced data is commonly characterized as having physical dimensions and a spatial location <ref> (Aronoff 1989) </ref>, and a georeferenced document is indexed according to such data. Historically, documents have been indexed primarily by subject, author, title, and, to a lesser extent, by document type. However, a diverse and large group of information system users desire geographically-oriented access to document collections.

Reference-contexts: First, georefer-encing should be based on a coordinate indexing system. Second, georeferencing should support a spatial display mechanism. Third, georeferencing should be automated. 3.1.1 Coordinate Indexing An information retrieval system must share a common language with the user <ref> (Batty 1989) </ref>. The lack of communication resulting from problems with text indexing has consequently made indexing and retrieval systems ineffective. Inconsistency and ambiguity in geographic headings in the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) list, for example, has been discussed at length in (Brinker 1962; Mischo 1982; Wellisch 1978).

Reference-contexts: The first consists of a topical subject heading followed by a geographic subdivision (e.g. ART - PARIS). The second consists of the place name followed by a topical subdivision (e.g. U.S. HISTORY). The third consists of a phrase which begins with a geographical adjective (e.g. NORWEGIAN LITERATURE) <ref> (Brinker 1962) </ref>. These have several well-documented problems. Inconsistent Subheadings A text document is most often assigned only one of these three types of index terms. Historically, this limit has been enforced to limit the size of the entire catalog. <p> However, the procedure for choosing which type of index is appropriate for various documents has not been well-specified. The consequent inconsistency makes it exceptionally difficult for a library catalog user to locate reliably items of interest <ref> (Brinker 1962) </ref>. Scatter Subdivision can also fragment references. Mischo (1982) writes that: "Single entry specific headings with more than one subdivision cause serious problems of scatter. <p> The physical size of the catalog limited the number of index terms for a document <ref> (Brinker 1962) </ref>; the computational complexity of automatic indexing techniques was limited by cpu speed; the lack of authority control in automatic systems created consistency and update problems; and, since documents were not online, they could not easily be indexed through electronic means (Tenopir & Ro 1990).

Reference-contexts: It additionally details technological motivations which make GIPSY's design viable. Finally, it presents GIPSY's georeferencing capabilities in the context of a complete information retrieval system using the TIOGA browser <ref> (Chen et al. 1992) </ref>. 3.1 Primary Goals Our system is motivated by the recognition of three separate but complementary goals. First, georefer-encing should be based on a coordinate indexing system. Second, georeferencing should support a spatial display mechanism. <p> As part of the project, many new technologies are being developed in the areas of tertiary storage, tertiary file systems, networking, scientific visualization, database management, and computer-facilitated collaboration <ref> (Chen et al. 1992) </ref>. The latter two issues pertain directly to information retrieval. To address the needs of Earth system scientists, a new browser paradigm has been proposed (Chen et al. 1992). <p> new technologies are being developed in the areas of tertiary storage, tertiary file systems, networking, scientific visualization, database management, and computer-facilitated collaboration <ref> (Chen et al. 1992) </ref>. The latter two issues pertain directly to information retrieval. To address the needs of Earth system scientists, a new browser paradigm has been proposed (Chen et al. 1992). In this system, called TIOGA, information will be displayed topologically according to continuous characteristics which are attributes of the data. For example, documents may be displayed on a map according to their latitude and longitude.

Reference-contexts: This makes it difficult for a user to retrieve all information which has been written about an area during any lengthy time period. * spatial and naming variation <ref> (Farrar & Lerud 1982) </ref> Terms vary not only over time, but in contemporary usage as well. * spelling variation (Farrar & Lerud 1982; Griffiths 1989) Geographic names vary in spelling, not only over time, but by language as well. * neologisms (Farrar & Lerud 1982) Study areas will often be given <p> any lengthy time period. * spatial and naming variation <ref> (Farrar & Lerud 1982) </ref> Terms vary not only over time, but in contemporary usage as well. * spelling variation (Farrar & Lerud 1982; Griffiths 1989) Geographic names vary in spelling, not only over time, but by language as well. * neologisms (Farrar & Lerud 1982) Study areas will often be given place names designated only in the context of a specific document or project. These occur particularly frequently for studies done in oceanic locations.

Reference-contexts: First, it has been suggested that humans use different cognitive structures for graphical information than for verbal information, and that spatial queries can not be fully simulated by verbal queries <ref> (Furnas 1991) </ref>. Because many geographical queries are inherently 4 spatial, a graphical model is more intuitive. This is supported by Morris' observation that users given the choice between menu and graphical interfaces to a geographic database preferred the graphical mode (Morris 1990).

Reference-contexts: This often makes a comprehensive search difficult, as Byron (1987) has observed. Geographic location is the shared attribute which can draw together these disparate subjects and document types to allow a cohesive search <ref> (Gardels 1993) </ref>. Authors such as Byron (1987), Hill (1990), and RLG (1989) have therefore recognized the need for research, development, and implementation of geographic indexing. The goal of the research reported here is to explore the utility and viability of indexing full-text documents using coordinates for spatial retrieval and display.

Reference-contexts: meticulously manually indexed, geographic index terms consisting of text strings have several well-documented problems, including: * lack of uniqueness (Griffiths 1989; Holmes 1990) Confusion can result from a reference to Cambridge, which might refer to either Cambridge, England or Cambridge, Massachusetts (to mention only two possibilities). * spatial boundary changes <ref> (Griffiths 1989) </ref> Political boundaries change over time, leading to confusion about the precise area being referred to. * name changes (Farrar & Lerud 1982; Griffiths 1989) Geographic names change over time.

Reference-contexts: However, there are disadvantages to manual indexing. First, manual indexing is expensive and time-consuming. The demands on resources are compounded by a desire, resulting in part from the hypertext paradigm, to index subcomponents of text using its structure <ref> (Hearst & Plaunt 1993) </ref> or its orthographic boundaries (e.g. paragraphs, sections). Second, it has long been recognized that manual indexing is inevitably inconsistent. Third, many other data types, such as satellite images and aerial photographs, exist primarily within a geographic space, and so naturally should be assigned geographic index terms.

Reference-contexts: Further, an empirical investigation comparing the use of text representations and coordinate systems to represent geographic areas has shown the inadequacy of text terms for indexing and retrieval <ref> (Hill 1990) </ref>. Because coordinates, unlike text, are unambiguous (Holmes 1990), they can be used to communicate uniquely locations to the information seeker. Further, many users require proximity queries which cannot be supported by textual terms. <p> First, it would be tremendously useful to develop a benchmark to compare GIPSY techniques to more traditional text-based indexing. A benchmark could also be used to tune system parameters. The most closely related work in this area is a dissertation comparing text-based and spatially-based indexing and retrieval <ref> (Hill 1990) </ref>. The text corpus and the techniques used in this study do not seem easily duplicable. However, although benchmarking is a daunting task, evaluation is extremely significant. Consequently, future work should include the development of a benchmark.

In the future, these data types may automatically be assigned geographic index terms through the use of global positioning systems (GPS) technologies <ref> (Holmes 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Korfhage (1991) has in fact argued that all information in a database should be on display to allow the user to make an informed query. This would allow the user greater flexibility and facilitate browsing <ref> (Korfhage 1986) </ref>. Third, in standard boolean information retrieval systems, the display is not ranked by (probable) relevance or utility; users receive insufficient information about what documents in the returned set are most pertinent to their searches.

Reference-contexts: This is supported by Morris' observation that users given the choice between menu and graphical interfaces to a geographic database preferred the graphical mode (Morris 1990). Second, a graphical interface, such as a map, allows for a dense presentation of information <ref> (McCann et al. 1988) </ref>. This addresses a problem which arises in the standard information retrieval system model.

Reference-contexts: For example, airfield is a synonym of airport, and university is a kind of school. The terms for these relationships were derived from the GNIS definitions, as well as from a variety of thesauri and dictionaries, including WordNet <ref> (Miller et al. 1990) </ref>. Land use types can have synonyms, kind-of relationships, and part-of relationships. Synonyms, kind-of relationships, and a number of part-of relationships were taken from the definitions of the Anderson Classification scheme.

Reference-contexts: This section details some of the previous work in these areas and their deficiencies in georeferencing text documents. 2.1.1 Library of Congress Subject Headings Although the Library of Congress did not originally intend to develop a standardized subject protocol <ref> (Mischo 1982) </ref>, the procedures it uses have had widespread impact on an international scale (Wellisch 1978). Therefore, perhaps the most significant example of manually-generated geographic subject description in library cataloging comes from the Library of Congress.

Reference-contexts: issues can be resolved in part by assigning multiple variant index terms to documents, the use of manually-generated textual subject headings plainly has many difficulties. 2.1.2 Keyword Indexing Because of the volume of full-text documents available online and the cost of human indexing, automatic indexing is an increasingly desirable strategy <ref> (Salton 1989) </ref>. Currently, automatic indexing is limited to the use of keywords and phrases extracted from the text.

Reference-contexts: We believe the large scale of this raw data will make possible the kind of assigned inferential indexing GIPSY is trying to provide. The second advantage provided by Project Sequoia 2000 will be the unique functionality offered by the easily extensible POSTGRES database management system (DBMS) <ref> (Stonebraker & Kemnitz 1991) </ref>. POSTGRES will not only allow integrated access to any number of data types, but will also contain geographic information system (GIS) functionality, and hence, be able to support spatially-related queries. 4 Solution This section describes the fundamental structure of GIPSY.

Reference-contexts: These occur particularly frequently for studies done in oceanic locations. These terms will be unknown to most users. 3 2.2 Coordinate Searching and Spatial Interfaces Several bibliographic systems have allowed use of coordinates in searching for text documents. In fact, GeoRef used manually-generated coordinates as early as 1978 <ref> (Tahirkheli 1989) </ref>. These systems support range searching in which the user generally specifies the coordinates of a box or point of interest. More recently, prototypes have been developed which allow map-based interfaces to documents including images and tabular data as well as text (RLG 1989; Holmes 1990). <p> The system must identify locations which most closely match the geographic terms extracted by the parser. In this model, extracted keywords and phrases must be mapped into the terminology used to describe several types of data. A hierarchical taxonomy can not adequately represent geographic terms <ref> (Tahirkheli 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: the number of index terms for a document (Brinker 1962); the computational complexity of automatic indexing techniques was limited by cpu speed; the lack of authority control in automatic systems created consistency and update problems; and, since documents were not online, they could not easily be indexed through electronic means <ref> (Tenopir & Ro 1990) </ref>. These factors, and many others, are changing rapidly. Online indexing and access to documents is increasingly in demand as computers become more ubiquitous and as multi-media applications become more common.

There are three types of geographic subject headings in Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH). <p> For example, in LCSH, the procedure for deciding whether islands should appear as high level entities, or as subdivisions, is apparently arbitrary <ref> (Wellisch 1978, pp. 164-165) </ref>.
