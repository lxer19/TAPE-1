Abstract: Allocating quality of service (QoS) has been a focus of recent work on distributed multimedia systems and networks. This paper explores a decentralized approach that allocates QoS through a dynamic market. In our approach, each agent makes decisions according to its local knowledge and interests, and prices adjust to clear the market in each resource. Dynamic changes in agent needs and network status cause the agents to revise their decisions continually. The market prices reflect system-wide values, inducing agents to produce and consume appropriate amounts of the various resources. We describe a market model for allocating bandwidth in an actual networked meeting environment called FreeWalk. Experiments reveal the responsiveness of the market-based approach to dynamic conditions in allocating QoS for multimedia network applications.

Reference-contexts: For the specific model above, this means q ij f ij (x cbw ). For this class of economies, the walras distributed bidding protocol <ref> (Cheng96) </ref> is guaranteed to converge to the unique competitive equilibrium. By setting the utility and production coefficients, we can calibrate the model to a baseline allocation we consider reasonable.

Reference-contexts: One approach that focuses particularly on this decentralization issue is to allocate resources through a market. In a market-based mechanism <ref> (Clearwater96) </ref>, the participating decision makers, or agents, exchange resources at established market prices. Each agent makes decisions according to its local knowledge and interests, and prices adjust to clear the market in each resource. <p> Related Work The FreeWalk market model is the latest in a series of computational economies developed using the wal-ras market-oriented programming environment (Well-man93), and one of a growing number of applications of market-based approaches to distributed resource allocation problems <ref> (Clearwater96) </ref>. Of the computational markets reported in the literature, several have been specifically devoted to allocating network bandwidth or other computational resources. For example, Kuwabara et. al (1996) present simulation results from a market-like model of communication network control.

Reference-contexts: Under certain conditions, the market prices reflect system-wide values, inducing agents to produce and consume appropriate amounts of the various resources. In this research, we applied a market-based approach for allocating bandwidth in a networked multimedia meeting environment called FreeWalk <ref> (Nakanishi96) </ref>. FreeWalk is the product of a broader project, called Socia (Ishida94; Yamaki96), aimed at supporting human communities through computer networks. Since QoS requirements change dynamically in Free-Walk, our market model focuses on the intertempo-ral dimension of the allocation.

Reference-contexts: The role of the QoS producer in this economy is to describe the relationship between network resources and service quality, however it may be measured. 1 CES forms are commonly employed in general equilibrium modeling <ref> (Shoven92) </ref>, due to their flexibility and convenient analytical properties. The assumption underlying CES is that the ratio of fractional increase in one good's consumption that would compensate for a fractional decrease in the other is a constant independent of the consumption levels.

Reference-contexts: This model has been implemented in walras, a market-oriented programming environment providing facilities for specifying and running computational economies <ref> (Wellman93) </ref>. Basic Concepts for Market Configuration there are two different time periods, current and future. This means we have four types of goods in the market. Circles in the diagram represent agents, of two types. Consumer agents represent FreeWalk clients, and producers represent the current and future network operations.
