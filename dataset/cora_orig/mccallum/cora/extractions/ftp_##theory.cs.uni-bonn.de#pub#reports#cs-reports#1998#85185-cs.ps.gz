Abstract: Let U be a real algebraic variety in n-dimensional affine space which is given as a set of zeros of a family of polynomials of the degree less than d. Let U (s) be the closure in the Zariski topology of set of all smooth points of dimension s of U . In the paper an algorithm is described for constructing a set with a polynomial in d n number of points of U which has a non-empty intersection with every connected component of dimension s of every irreducible component of U (s) . The similar result is valid for basic real semi-algebraic sets. More precise formulations are given involving triangulations of U if U is bounded (respectively the Alexan-drov compactification of U if U is not bounded). The working time of the algorithm (for the case of algebraic varieties) is polynomial in the size of input and d n .

Reference-contexts: is a connected component of the real algebraic variety Z R (f *g) " Z R (L 1 L 1 (z 0 ); : : : ; L s L s (z 0 )): (18) In what follows we shall suppose that the semi-algebraic set B 1 is triangulated, see <ref> [2] </ref>. Then this triangulation induces the triangulation of S 1 . The set B 1 defines the (ns)-dimensional chain b 1 and S 1 defines the (ns1)-dimensional cycle s 1 which is the bound of b 1 , i.e. s 1 = @b 1 . <p> For every simplex oe p j of the considered cycle e the image OE (oe p j ) is contained in some irreducible component of V s , see <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> Further in a similar way one can construct the set S y . The theorem is now proved for the case R = R. In the general case we use the transfer principle, <ref> [2] </ref>. It is sufficient to note that the fact that the real algebraic variety is semi-algebraically triangulated can be expressed in the language of the first order theory of real fields. The theorem is proved. 36

Reference-contexts: Let V s be the closure in the Zariski topology of the set of all smooth points of the real algebraic variety V (R). The number of irreducible components of V s is bounded from above by P (d n ) for a polynomial P, see <ref> [15] </ref>. By Lemma 8 there is an integer a 6= 0 bounded from above by a polynomial in d n such that (ac; ac 2 ; : : : ; ac n1 ) = for all integers 1 c nP (d n ) + 1.

Reference-contexts: Let us show that s 1 is not homological to zero in H ns1 (R n n E; Z=2Z). Indeed, the intersection of B 1 " E consists of one point z 0 and is transversal in this point. So by the general topological duality theory, see <ref> [16] </ref>, the linking coefficient modulo 2 of cycles e and s 1 is not zero. From here our assertion follows immediately. Thus, we have 0 6= Im (j ) = Im (j + ) = 0.
