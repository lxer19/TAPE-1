Title: Notes on the Computation of the Incremental Gain of Linear Systems with Saturation  
Degree: Submitted to the 34th CDC B.G. Romanchuk  
Keyword: nonlinear H 1 control, systems with saturation, linear matrix inequalities.  
Date: February 28, 1995  
Abstract: Conditions for the non-existence of the incremental ` p gain of single input discrete time linear systems with saturation is presented, as well as algebraic tests for bounding the induced ` 2 and L 2 gains. These algebraic tests are found to be the same as those which would arise if one were to conservatively use a quadratic dissipation function to bound the induced 2-norm.

The equation (5) is equivalent to the algebraic Riccati equation by the use of the Schur complement formula. Proposition 3.2: If we define the V (x) = x 0 P x, then the following hold: 1.

Reference-contexts: The class of plants for which the results are applicable has been generalised at the cost of restricting our attention to the standard saturation function (as opposed to the generic class of nonlinearities studied in <ref> [2] </ref>). 2 Preliminaries Definition 2.1: The closed loop plant operator : w 7! z is generated by the state space equations: x [k + 1] = Ax [k] + B 0 (w [k] Cx [k]); (1) x [0] = 0: (3) Additionally, it is assumed that: A 2 R nfin ; <p> We then have by the defintion of S M;p , k ~w wk p ff kuk p This contradiction proves Theorem 3.8.2 Remark 3.11: A similar construction is made in <ref> [2, Example 5] </ref> for a first order (continuous time) system.

Reference-contexts: The inequalities which result are the same as those which would result from attempting to force a global quadratic solution to the test for the induced norm given in <ref> [4] </ref>, which indicates that such algebraic tests are telling us about incremental gain magnitudes. <p> It is important to note that for any fixed system, there exists some N fl &gt; 0 such that if N &lt; N fl , the induced norm over W p;1 (N ) is finite, a consequence of the discrete time counterpart of the results in <ref> [4] </ref>. Additionally, we have fixed the system to have unity negative feedback so as to avoid any technical complications with observability properties. 3 New Results 3.1 Incremental Bound Computation We will first present a useful result which can be used to bound the incremental gain, using linear matrix inequalities. <p> time incremental gain inequalities for a gain fl, then kw ~wk 2 &lt; fl kw ~wk 2 ; Remark 3.6: As kk i;2 kk ;2 , we have just found an algebraic test for bounding above the induced 2-norm, which may be useful in comparison with the technique given in <ref> [4] </ref>. In fact, if one were to attempt to globally fit a quadratic candididate dissipation function to the tests given in [4], it would necessarily also solve the incremental gain inequalities given in this paper. The inter-relationships between the incremental gain and induced norm are more fully explored in [5]. <p> kk i;2 kk ;2 , we have just found an algebraic test for bounding above the induced 2-norm, which may be useful in comparison with the technique given in <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: W p;1 (n 1 )) is defined: kk ;p = sup w; ~w2` p+ (resp. W p;1 (N));w6= ~w kw ~wk p : A development of the properties of such systems can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. It is important to note that for any fixed system, there exists some N fl &gt; 0 such that if N &lt; N fl , the induced norm over W p;1 (N ) is finite, a consequence of the discrete time counterpart of the results in [4]. <p> Although linear matrix inequalities have been used to bound the induced norm of such systems, the author is unaware of any references which in fact note that the quadratic potential functions derived are better suited for the incremental gain computation. And as is more fully explored in <ref> [5] </ref>, the incremental gain computation via quadratic dissipation functions does not appear to be conservative, whereas they will give rise to conservative analysis for the induced norm. These results have first appeared in [5]. <p> And as is more fully explored in <ref> [5] </ref>, the incremental gain computation via quadratic dissipation functions does not appear to be conservative, whereas they will give rise to conservative analysis for the induced norm. These results have first appeared in [5]. Definition 3.1: The matrix P is the solution to the discrete incremental gain algebraic inequalities for a gain fl, if: 1. P is such that P = P T , and P &gt; 0, 2. <p> Therefore, 0 [k + 1]P [k + 1] , implying that s [k] 0, verifying the claim. 2 It is fairly straightforward to extend this result to continuous time; this is done in <ref> [5] </ref>. The result will be presented here without proof, although it closely follows the discrete time case. The system is of the same form as the system defined in equations (1) - (3), although we of course replace x [k +1] with _x (k) in equation (1). <p> In fact, if one were to attempt to globally fit a quadratic candididate dissipation function to the tests given in [4], it would necessarily also solve the incremental gain inequalities given in this paper. The inter-relationships between the incremental gain and induced norm are more fully explored in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Proof: It is trivial that if the induced norm does not exist, the incremental gain is also unbounded. This will occur if the closed loop dynamics matrix A BC is unstable, or if A is unstable and n 1 is chosen large enough (for details, see <ref> [5] </ref>). We now examine the case where A BC is stable, and the induced norm over W p;1 (n 1 ) is finite. We can now make the following observations, which are standard consequences of linear system properties. <p> Proof: In <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 4 Concluding Remarks The incremental gain properties of systems with saturation nonlinearities have been examined herein.
