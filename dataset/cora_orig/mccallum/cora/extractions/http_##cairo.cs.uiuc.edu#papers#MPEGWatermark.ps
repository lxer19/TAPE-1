Abstract: Various digital watermarking techniques have been proposed in recent years as the methods to protect the copyright of multimedia data. However, as pointed out by the IBM research group, the rightful ownership problem has not been properly solved. Currently, there are two proposals to solve the ownership problem. Unfortunately, one proposal lacks a formal proof and the other can be easily defeated. In this paper, we present watermarking methods which will be successful in resolving rightful ownership of watermarked MPEG video. By introducing specific requirements in the watermark construction, the proposed scheme is proved to be non-invertible. We show the invertibility of those schemes which do not use the original in its verification, discuss in depth various issues of the watermark construction requirements, extent the basic idea to create a non-invertible scheme for image, and discuss the usage of different non-invertible schemes.

Reference-contexts: However, because of the use of least significant bits, the identification code can be easily destroyed. There are many other proposals for watermarking such as Tanaka's schemes [TNM90] which use the fact that the quantization noise is typically imperceptible to users, Brassil's methods <ref> [BLMO94] </ref> for textual document images, and Caronni's geometric patterns (also called tags) [Car95].

Reference-contexts: However, because the choice of the frequency set is not based on any perceptual significance and the variance of the frequency coefficients is small, it may be sensitive to noise or distortions. It is also vulnerable to multiple-document attacks b . Cox, Kilian, Leighton, and Shamoon <ref> [CKLS95] </ref> argue that a watermark must be placed in perceptually significant components of a signal if it is to be robust to common signal distortions and attacks. <p> In doing so, the original information which were changed by the preprocessing will never be exposed. 4.2 Raw-Image-Based Non-Invertible Watermarking Scheme By applying the similar idea discussed in Section 4.1, we can give a modified version of the scheme described by Cox et al <ref> [CKLS95] </ref>: ALGORITHM 2 Given an original image V , let us choose a key KEY .

Reference-contexts: The watermark schemes should also be robust against the multiple-document attacks. However, there are still some questions. One of them, as pointed out by Craver et al from IBM <ref> [CMYY96] </ref>, is how to resolve the rightful ownership of the invisible watermarking schemes. Craver et al attacked existing watermarking techniques by providing counterfeit watermarking schemes that can be performed on a watermarked image to allow multiple claims of ownerships. We refer to their attack as the IBM attack. <p> The problem is that it may violate the requirement of labeling most significant components. The watermark embedding process is also slow. It can only handle data at a rate of several bytes per second. Craver, Memon, Yeo, and Yeung <ref> [CMYY96] </ref> from IBM address an important issue of rightful ownership. They provide as an attack counterfeit watermarking schemes that can be performed on a watermarked image to allow multiple claims of rightful ownerships. We will refer to this attack as the IBM attack. <p> Otherwise, (E, D, C) is (weakly d ) non-invertible. 2 c Craver et al's original definition did not have this word. d Craver et al's original definition did not have this word. 4 Definition 1 comes from the Craver's paper <ref> [CMYY96] </ref>. However, the requirement of E (V F ; W F ) = V W is too restrictive (too strong) on the invertibility because V W could be altered and even the original V and W may not satisfy E (V; W ) = V W in the verification process.

Reference-contexts: They introduce new data hiding schemes whose parameters can be adjusted with the capacity, imperceptibility, and robustness. Koch, Rindfrey, and Zhao <ref> [EK96] </ref> present an image watermarking method. The image is grouped into 8x8 blocks and each 8x8 block is DCT transformed.

Reference-contexts: The watermark consists of 1000 randomly generated numbers. The length of the watermark is variable and can be adjusted to suit the characteristics of the data. Langelaar et al <ref> [GCL97] </ref> propose two image watermarking methods. The first one extends the existing spatial labeling technique which adds a positive integer constant k to the brightness of 50% of the pixels in an image. This constant k is called the label embedding level.

Reference-contexts: The second method removes high frequency DCT-coefficients in some areas to embed a label. However, this method may remove too many DCT-coefficients therefore cause distortions. Hartung and Girod <ref> [HG97] </ref> provide a watermarking scheme specifically for MPEG encoded video. The basic idea is to apply DCT to each of 8x8 blocks of the watermark and then add the DCT coefficients of the watermark to the corresponding DCT coefficients of MPEG stream.

Reference-contexts: It's obvious that this method will be limited to those images with a lot of textures. a Cropping eliminates parts of an original image and also allows the remaining parts of the image to be enlarged to fill the space. 2 Smith and Comiskey <ref> [SC96] </ref> theoretically discuss the characteristics of the data hiding schemes, such as the amount of information that can be hidden, the perceptibility, the robustness which is modeled using the quantities of channel, the signal-to-noise ratio, and the jamming margin.

Reference-contexts: Similar idea can also be applied to images [vSTO94]. However, because of the use of least significant bits, the identification code can be easily destroyed. There are many other proposals for watermarking such as Tanaka's schemes <ref> [TNM90] </ref> which use the fact that the quantization noise is typically imperceptible to users, Brassil's methods [BLMO94] for textual document images, and Caronni's geometric patterns (also called tags) [Car95].

Reference-contexts: All these schemes are important in the understanding of solving the actual problem "rightful ownership". During the past few years, a number of digital watermarking methods have been proposed. Among the earliest works, L.F. Turner <ref> [Tur89] </ref> proposed a digital audio watermarking method which substitutes the least significant bits of randomly selected audio samples with the bits of an identification string (watermark). Similar idea can also be applied to images [vSTO94].

Reference-contexts: But in order to verify the watermark construction, something other than watermarked image itself has to be presented. This contradicts to the concept and the definition of Self-Proof Class scheme. Another attempt to resolve the ownership problem is provided by Wolfgang and Delp <ref> [WD97] </ref>. Their method uses timestamp to generate the watermark. Then the owner with the earliest timestamp is the true owner. However, this scheme can be easily defeated because timestamps can be manipulated.
