Abstract: We discuss the theory and practical issues behind creating reflection models to show the difficulty of the problem. We survey the current approaches towards reflection models for computer graphics to show that even for simple surfaces, the important issues are far from settled. We briefly discuss future directions for research. Finally, we present a case study of a particular type of light reflection that captures some important aspects of appearance for a limited class of materials with subsurface reflection.

Reference-contexts: Researchers therefore often look for approximations that are more efficient [16, 33]. Reflectance models for which entire illumination compu tations can be carried out analytically, rather than numeri-cally, present an interesting option, as Arvo <ref> [1] </ref> showed for the Phong BRDF. In Monte Carlo lighting simulations it is often advantageous if one can sample according to the BRDF, when tracing random walks of light particles through a scene. An example of this is discussed in Section 5.1.1. Another aspect is memory use.

Reference-contexts: Scratches on a surface may be visually important when viewed from arms length, but they become invisible from larger distances. Westin et al. [42] recognized the need for different geometric models and reflectance models at different scales. Becker and Max <ref> [2] </ref> presented techniques to smoothly transit between different representations. Pharr et al. [28] discussed efficient techniques to store and render the geometric detail. Measuring how the BRDF varies over a surface (as a function of (u; v) in our terminology) is largely an unaddressed problem.

Reference-contexts: This representation can be derived from low-level physics and fit with either direct micro-geometric parameters, or fit with measured BRDF data. Examples of this approach for isotropic surface-reflection are the models of Blinn <ref> [3] </ref>, Cook and Torrance [6], and He et al. [17]. For the anisotropic case there are the model of Ka-jiya [18], and Poulin and Fournier [31]. For rough surfaces with subsurface reflection there is the model of Oren and Nayar [26].

Reference-contexts: In this case it is possible to compute a BRDF through simulating the scattering of light by the surface, in effect, using the computer to simulate a gonioreflectometer. This is usually done by casting rays at the surface and computing the distribution of the resulting scattered rays <ref> [4, 42] </ref>. These methods are limited by the difficulty of getting the data and their restriction to geometric optics. They are capable of simulating very complex BRDFs due to highly structured and complicated geometry. <p> The simplest is to create an explicit three-dimensional table for each wavelength. This strategy is memory intensive and how the interpolation should be done in the ta ble is not clear. Because ( 0 ; 0 ) is a coordinate system on the hemisphere, spherical harmonics have been employed <ref> [4, 38, 42] </ref>. Zernike polynomials, defined on the hemisphere rather than the sphere, have also been used [7]. The danger of using these orthogonal bases is ringing, which can cause visual artifacts.

Reference-contexts: In either case, an accurate model of the scene is needed, describing salient aspects of shapes and materials that contribute to the final images. Typically, the material description is assumed to be the easiest part of creating an image <ref> [5] </ref>. However, it has been our experience that describing the materials can often be the most problematic part of image synthesis. In this paper we discuss why this is the case, and what issues need to be resolved to enable realistic images to be more easily generated.

Reference-contexts: An example of a model is the Cook-Torrance model <ref> [6] </ref>, where low-level physics is used to infer a natural representation for the BRDF. An example of a representation is a piece-wise linear table. A model is of course also a representation, so we will call all BRDF storage strategies representations for the remainder of this discussion. <p> This representation can be derived from low-level physics and fit with either direct micro-geometric parameters, or fit with measured BRDF data. Examples of this approach for isotropic surface-reflection are the models of Blinn [3], Cook and Torrance <ref> [6] </ref>, and He et al. [17]. For the anisotropic case there are the model of Ka-jiya [18], and Poulin and Fournier [31]. For rough surfaces with subsurface reflection there is the model of Oren and Nayar [26]. <p> This equation is a simplified version of the BRDF where R s is independent of wavelength. This independence causes a highlight that is the color of the luminaire, so a polished rather than a metal appearance will be achieved <ref> [6] </ref>. Ward suggests that in order to conserve energy, R d () + R s 1 [41]. However, such models with constant R s fail to show the increase in specularity for steep viewing angles.

Reference-contexts: Because ( 0 ; 0 ) is a coordinate system on the hemisphere, spherical harmonics have been employed [4, 38, 42]. Zernike polynomials, defined on the hemisphere rather than the sphere, have also been used <ref> [7] </ref>. The danger of using these orthogonal bases is ringing, which can cause visual artifacts. Spherical wavelets have been employed to attempt to get the cleanliness of tables and the compactness of polynomial representation [35]. <p> Dana et al. have begun a database of measurements of surfaces with variable BRDF, and their description of the task makes it clear that very concerted efforts are needed to make any progress in this area <ref> [7] </ref>. 5 Case study: matte/specular reflection Suppose we were to create a realistic renderer that modeled micro-geometry explicitly, and used very simple reflection models for the smooth facets. This type of renderer has been shown to be practical for at least some scenes by Pharr et al. [28, 29].

Reference-contexts: We can render an object with known parameters such as copper, and have some confidence in the result. However, the object will look like a unnaturally new copper coin. What is missing is corrosion, scratches, and patina. These can be simulated <ref> [8] </ref>, but then the simple Fresnel equations do not apply. Also, uncorroded metal is likely to be an alloy, so we probably cannot easily get data for k () or n (). In typical image synthesis applications, surfaces are neither smooth nor clean.

We could now insert the full form of the Fresnel equations to get R f () and then use energy conservation to solve for constraints on k.

These are challenging devices to build and calibrate <ref> [10] </ref>. Assuming we can get the measurements, the next issue is a good representation for the data, as will be discussed in Section 4.2. Measuring BRDFs is a slow and expensive process that requires having a sample of the material on hand. This makes measurement infeasible in many cases.

Reference-contexts: A typical example is latex paint, where colored particles are suspended in a transparent substrate. The scattered component is usually approximated by a Lambertian term.

Hanrahan and Krueger <ref> [14] </ref>, Gondek et al. [13] and Schramm et al. [34] have simulated subsurface scattering using Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining BRDFs of materials such as leaves, skin and paints. <p> Therefore the problem must lie in the matte term. We could use a full-blown simulation of subsurface scattering as implemented by Hanrahan and Krueger <ref> [14] </ref>, but this technique is both costly and requires detailed knowledge of subsurface structure, which is usually neither known nor easily measurable. Instead, we can modify the matte term to be a simple approximation that captures the important qualitative angular behavior shown in Figure 4.

Reference-contexts: We try to keep the formulas reasonably simple because the physics of the matte term is complicated and sometimes requires unknown parameters. We expect the matte term to be close to constant, and roughly rotationally symmetric, as is argued in He's dissertation <ref> [15] </ref>. An obvious candidate for the matte component m (; 0 ; ) that will be reciprocal is the separable form kR m ()f ()f ( 0 ) for some constant k and matte reflectance parameter R m ().

Reference-contexts: For that purpose, the functions should be efficient to evaluate. For instance, the He model is sophisticated but computationally expensive, because its evaluation includes a slowly converging series. Researchers therefore often look for approximations that are more efficient <ref> [16, 33] </ref>. Reflectance models for which entire illumination compu tations can be carried out analytically, rather than numeri-cally, present an interesting option, as Arvo [1] showed for the Phong BRDF.

For the anisotropic case there are the model of Ka-jiya [18], and Poulin and Fournier [31]. For rough surfaces with subsurface reflection there is the model of Oren and Nayar [26]. <p> This is the key point: in the real world the relative propor-tions of matte and specular appearance change with viewing angle. He et al. suggest using the Fresnel equation for the coefficient of the specular term <ref> [17] </ref>, but do not address the subsurface term's angular behavior because this model is intended primarily to simulate surface physics.

Reference-contexts: This should cause some unease, because in simple instances polarization can play an important role even when the emitted light is randomly polarized [40, 23]. To add to the unease, note that the light coming from the sky is partially polarized <ref> [19] </ref>. For engineering applications where accuracy is critical, polarization should be accounted for. For the rest of this paper we will assume that a world without polarized light would not look much different, so ignoring polarization will be acceptable for appearance-based applications.

Reference-contexts: This approach was first employed in graphics by Phong [30], and was generalized by Ward [41] and Schlick [33]. A more general approach has been implemented by Lafortune <ref> [20] </ref>, who has achieved good data fits for the isotropic case. We think it likely that this avenue is likely to continue to be fruitful. 4.3 Practical issues In computer graphics applications, reflectance functions are usually part of a larger illumination simulation framework.

Reference-contexts: Spherical wavelets have been employed to attempt to get the cleanliness of tables and the compactness of polynomial representation [35]. The practical details of this approach have been developed by researchers at the University of British Columbia, as is detailed in Lalonde's forthcoming dissertation <ref> [21] </ref>. This is a promising approach, although somewhat daunting to an implementer. Two flaws limit the above approaches. They require expensive data acquisition and storage, and are not able to allow natural user modification.

Reference-contexts: Many rendering algorithms rely on these properties, so it is important when using these renderers that BRDF models both conserve energy and be reciprocal. Lewis calls BRDF models that are faithful to these constraints physi cally plausible <ref> [22] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, image synthesis practitioners almost never take polarization into account and assume random polarization everywhere. This should cause some unease, because in simple instances polarization can play an important role even when the emitted light is randomly polarized <ref> [40, 23] </ref>. To add to the unease, note that the light coming from the sky is partially polarized [19]. For engineering applications where accuracy is critical, polarization should be accounted for.

Reference-contexts: For metal and glass surfaces, we would use the Fresnel equations directly. For dull surfaces we could use the Lambertian model because in many applications the errors that result from using the model to approximate matte reflection are not visually significant <ref> [24] </ref>. But what model should we use for matte/specular (sometimes called polished) materials that are smooth but have significant subsurface scattering? In this section we argue that current general models do not model this matte/specular case well, and develop a special-purpose model that we call the coupled model.

Reference-contexts: Also note that the blurring in the specular reflection is mostly vertical. This is due to the compression of apparent bump spacing in the view direction. This effect causes the vertically-streaked reflections seen on lakes on windy days <ref> [25] </ref>, and can either be modeled using explicit micro-geometry and a simple smooth-surface reflection model or by an as yet unrealized more general model that accounts for this asymmetry.

Reference-contexts: A typical example is latex paint, where colored particles are suspended in a transparent substrate. The scattered component is usually approximated by a Lambertian term. Hanrahan and Krueger [14], Gondek et al. [13] and Schramm et al. <ref> [34] </ref> have simulated subsurface scattering using Monte Carlo simulations, obtaining BRDFs of materials such as leaves, skin and paints.

Reference-contexts: Zernike polynomials, defined on the hemisphere rather than the sphere, have also been used [7]. The danger of using these orthogonal bases is ringing, which can cause visual artifacts. Spherical wavelets have been employed to attempt to get the cleanliness of tables and the compactness of polynomial representation <ref> [35] </ref>. The practical details of this approach have been developed by researchers at the University of British Columbia, as is detailed in Lalonde's forthcoming dissertation [21]. This is a promising approach, although somewhat daunting to an implementer. Two flaws limit the above approaches.

Reference-contexts: Shirley attempted to simulate the change in the matte appearance with angle by explicitly dampening R d () as R s increases <ref> [36] </ref>: (; ; 0 ; 0 ; ) = R f () s (; ; 0 ; 0 ) + where R f () is the Fresnel reflectance for a polish-air interface.

Reference-contexts: This situation is governed by the Fresnel equations which describe the ratio of reflected and transmitted energy as a function of incident direction, polarization, and properties of the two materials <ref> [37] </ref>. For simplicity we assume that one of the materials is vacuum or air, which have almost identical optical prop erties at a material interface. A fundamental property of the Fresnel equations is that they predict different reflectance behavior for the two states of polarization.

Reference-contexts: However, image synthesis practitioners almost never take polarization into account and assume random polarization everywhere. This should cause some unease, because in simple instances polarization can play an important role even when the emitted light is randomly polarized <ref> [40, 23] </ref>. To add to the unease, note that the light coming from the sky is partially polarized [19]. For engineering applications where accuracy is critical, polarization should be accounted for.

Reference-contexts: A final approach to representation is top-down, where intuition and experience is used to develop an expressive and convenient representation with a small number of free parameters. This approach was first employed in graphics by Phong [30], and was generalized by Ward <ref> [41] </ref> and Schlick [33]. A more general approach has been implemented by Lafortune [20], who has achieved good data fits for the isotropic case. <p> This independence causes a highlight that is the color of the luminaire, so a polished rather than a metal appearance will be achieved [6]. Ward suggests that in order to conserve energy, R d () + R s 1 <ref> [41] </ref>. However, such models with constant R s fail to show the increase in specularity for steep viewing angles. This is the key point: in the real world the relative propor-tions of matte and specular appearance change with viewing angle.

Reference-contexts: In this case it is possible to compute a BRDF through simulating the scattering of light by the surface, in effect, using the computer to simulate a gonioreflectometer. This is usually done by casting rays at the surface and computing the distribution of the resulting scattered rays <ref> [4, 42] </ref>. These methods are limited by the difficulty of getting the data and their restriction to geometric optics. They are capable of simulating very complex BRDFs due to highly structured and complicated geometry. <p> The simplest is to create an explicit three-dimensional table for each wavelength. This strategy is memory intensive and how the interpolation should be done in the ta ble is not clear. Because ( 0 ; 0 ) is a coordinate system on the hemisphere, spherical harmonics have been employed <ref> [4, 38, 42] </ref>. Zernike polynomials, defined on the hemisphere rather than the sphere, have also been used [7]. The danger of using these orthogonal bases is ringing, which can cause visual artifacts. <p> The scale at which BRDFs should be modeled is still largely an open problem. Scratches on a surface may be visually important when viewed from arms length, but they become invisible from larger distances. Westin et al. <ref> [42] </ref> recognized the need for different geometric models and reflectance models at different scales. Becker and Max [2] presented techniques to smoothly transit between different representations. Pharr et al. [28] discussed efficient techniques to store and render the geometric detail.
