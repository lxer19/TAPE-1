Abstract: The patient-adaptive classifier was compared with a well-established baseline algorithm on six major databases, consisting of over 3 million heartbeats. When trained on an initial 77 records and tested on an additional 382 records, the patient-adaptive algorithm was found to reduce the number of Vn errors on one channel by a factor of 5, and the number of Nv errors by a factor of 10. We conclude that patient adaptation provides a significant advance in classifying normal vs. ventricular beats for ECG Patient Monitoring.

Reference-contexts: Each set of weights corresponds to a basis vector in weight space which is modulated by its corresponding patient model unit. Thus, the actual classifier model is a function of the unmodulated and modulated weight vectors. This approach is analogous to speaker-adaptation in speech recognition <ref> [1] </ref>. The architecture of the completed network is depicted in Figure 1. The figure is schematic, and does not represent the model exactly. In actuality, there were 8 input units, 24 first hidden layer units, 14 second hidden layer units and one output unit.

Reference-contexts: These rules were expressed as Horn clauses in disjunctive normal form and were instantiated in neural network form by an algorithmic process that completely determines the network structure and the values of the interconnection weights <ref> [2] </ref>. The neural network was instantiated with continuous valued functions. As a result, the output of the rule-based equivalent network classifier could provide a measure of the probability of the normalcy of each beat. This measure could be used to compute receiver 1 operator characteristics.
