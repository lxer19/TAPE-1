Reference-contexts: In a variety of routine computer usage tasks such as word processing and spreadsheet usage, these routine pauses are fairly uniform in length, justifying the simplifying assumption that all Ms take the same amount of time, around one sec. Based on the available results <ref> (Olson & Olson, 1989) </ref>, a good overall estimate for the duration of an M is 1.2 sec. Choosing how many Ms are involved, and where they appear, is the hardest part of using the KLM. W (t) - W aiting for the system to respond (time t must be determined).
