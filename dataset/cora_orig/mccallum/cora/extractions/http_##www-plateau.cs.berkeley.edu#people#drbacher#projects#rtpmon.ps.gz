Title: rtpmon: A Third-Party RTCP Monitor

Abstract: A number of multicast conferencing applications have already been developed for the MBone using the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP). In this paper, we describe rtpmon, a program for displaying control information associated with an RTP session. Rtpmon displays a table-based overview of the control feedback generated by participants in the RTP session. We describe the features of this program along with our experiences developing it and using it to monitor the traffic in a seminar broadcast weekly on the MBone.

Reference-contexts: The existing LBL conferencing tools, provide statistics display based on the actual reception of RTP packets. The features provided by these programs motivated the implementation of our third-party monitor. Several other projects have used RTCP reports to gather information about participants in an RTP session. Mlisten <ref> [AA95] </ref> can produce summaries of the number of participants who tuned in to the specified RTP sessions; this program can aid in the administrative task of recording the participants of RTP broadcasts. MSessMon [Ste] provides visual feedback of RTCP distribution quality parameters tightly coupled with routing information.

Reference-contexts: In the late 1980's, Steve Deering of Stanford University implemented multicast for IP. His work involved modifying a host implementation of IP to support multicast as well as designing and implementing a wide area multicast routing protocol <ref> [Dee89] </ref>. In the IP Multicast standard, a range of IP addresses is reserved as multicast addresses.

Reference-contexts: The Internet now has a patchwork of these tunnels connecting regions in which native IP Mul-ticast is available; this collection of tunnels is called the Internet Multicast Backbone, or the MBone <ref> [Eri94] </ref>. Since it has been a struggle to deploy IP Mul-ticast, few applications have taken advantage of it. The first widely used applications to emerge have been multimedia tools that can be used for real-time audio and video transmission among sites connected to the MBone.

Reference-contexts: The first widely used applications to emerge have been multimedia tools that can be used for real-time audio and video transmission among sites connected to the MBone. The most popular applications have been a suite of tools produced at Lawrence Berkeley Labs (LBL), including vic <ref> [MJ95] </ref>, a video conferencing tool, and vat [VJ], the visual audio tool. Using these tools, meetings of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), several other technical conferences, live feeds from the Space Shuttle, a Rolling Stones concert and a number of other events have been multicast.

Reference-contexts: It is also designed to be scalable so that it can be used in a multicast environment with a large number of users. RTP is designed to work for a variety of real-time applications; an accompanying profile describes how RTP is used to carry audio and video payloads <ref> [Sch96] </ref>. Common to all implementations of RTP is the RTP Control Protocol (RTCP). The primary purpose of RTCP is to provide feedback to other conference participants about reception quality. An RTP session consists of two channels, one for data packets and one for RTCP control packets.
