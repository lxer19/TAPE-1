Title: The Stationary Wavelet Transform and some Statistical Applications  
Author: G.P. Nason and B.W. Silverman 
Address: BS8 1TW, UK  
Affiliation: Department of Mathematics, University of Bristol, Bristol  
Abstract: Wavelets are of wide potential use in statistical contexts. The basics of the discrete wavelet transform are reviewed using a filter notation that is useful subsequently in the paper. A `stationary wavelet transform', where the coefficient sequences are not decimated at each stage, is described. Two different approaches to the construction of an inverse of the stationary wavelet transform are set out. The application of the stationary wavelet transform as an exploratory statistical method is discussed, together with its potential use in nonparametric regression. A method of local spectral density estimation is developed. This involves extensions to the wavelet context of standard time series ideas such as the periodogram and spectrum. The technique is illustrated by its application to data sets from astronomy and veterinary anatomy.

Reference-contexts: In particular we shall be concerned with an extension of the standard discrete wavelet transform, which we term the stationary wavelet transform.

In order to do this, we need to set 2 Nason and Silverman out ways of inverting the stationary wavelet transform, again building on work of Pesquet et al. <ref> [PKC] </ref>. The stationary wavelet transform has a valuable role in the exploration and spectral analysis of non-stationary time series. <p> A suitable entropy function can be used to choose between possible bases.
