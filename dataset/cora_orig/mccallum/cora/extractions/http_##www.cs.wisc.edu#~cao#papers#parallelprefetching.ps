Title: Integrated Parallel Prefetching and Caching  
Abstract: it is important to properly integrate prefetching and caching. In this paper, we study integrated prefetching and caching strategies for multiple disks. We present two algorithms, regular aggressive and reverse aggressive, and show that reverse aggressive is close to optimal. Using trace-driven simulation on a collection of file access traces, we evaluated these algorithms under a variety of data placement alternatives. Our results show that both algorithms can achieve near linear speedup when the load is distributed evenly on the disks, and reverse aggressive performs well even when the placement of blocks on disks distributes the load unevenly. Our simulations also show that, for file system traces, replicating data, even across all of the disks, offers little performance advantage over a striped layout if prefetching is done well. Finally, we evaluate four online variations of the algorithms and show that the online algorithms perform well even with moderate advance knowledge of future file accesses.
