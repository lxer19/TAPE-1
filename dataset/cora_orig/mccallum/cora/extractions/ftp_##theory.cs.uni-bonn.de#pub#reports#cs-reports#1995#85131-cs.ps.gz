Abstract: The Steiner tree problem requires to find a shortest tree connecting a given set of terminal points in a metric space. We design approximation algorithms for the Steiner problems in graphs and in the rectilinear plane with the best up to now ratios 1.644 and 1.267, respectively.

Reference-contexts: Consideration of k-restricted Steiner trees gave several better heuristics. For NSP, PR of the em greedy algorithm (GA) (Zelikovsky [16, 18]) is at most 11 6 1:84 and PR of Berman-Ramaiyer's heuristic (BR) <ref> [2] </ref> is at most 16 9 1:78.

In the recent paper Berman et al [3] gave a more precise (than in the first papers <ref> [17, 2] </ref> ) analysis of the performance ratio of BR for RSP. They proved that its performance ratio is at most 61 48 1:271. BR can run in O (n 1:5 ) time and its parametrized version (PBR) can run in O (n log 2 n) time [3, 7]. <p> By +* we mean existance of an algorithm for any * &gt; 0.

R (T ) consists of the edges of the largest cost on the paths in M ST (D) connecting pairs of terminals of T <ref> [2] </ref>. Denote by m (T ) = mst (D) mst (D [ E (T )) the cost of R (T ). Thus, g (T ) = m (T ) d (T ). <p> Thus, g (T ) = m (T ) d (T ). Note, that addition of any edges to D may only decrease m (T ) and the gain of T <ref> [2] </ref>, therefore, g (fT i ; i = 1; :::; pg) i=1 By contraction of T we mean addition of E (T ) to D. A greedy algorithm (GA) [16] finds a 3-tree with the biggest gain and conracts it while there are 3-trees with a positive gain. <p> All contracted 3-trees and the rest of MST-edges form the output Steiner tree. The k-restricted relative greedy heuristic (k-RGH) [19] runs simalar to GA but maximizing (among all k-trees T ) m (T )=d (T ) instead of m (T ) d (T ). Berman-Ramaiyer <ref> [2] </ref> suggested a sofisticated generalization of GA for an arbitrary k (k-BR). k-BR proceesses all i-trees, i = 1; :::; k, with a positive gain modifying the set D and forming a stack of i-trees chosen. <p> We denote by t k = t k (S) a supremum of mst (D [ E k ) over all E k 's. The output cost of GA [16] (k = 3) and k-BR <ref> [2] </ref> is at most t 2 i=3 i 1 t 2 + i=3 (i 1)i t k (2) To bound the values t k , Berman-Ramayer [2] introduced the following useful definition. A Steiner tree is k-restricted, if every its full component is a k-tree. <p> The output cost of GA [16] (k = 3) and k-BR <ref> [2] </ref> is at most t 2 i=3 i 1 t 2 + i=3 (i 1)i t k (2) To bound the values t k , Berman-Ramayer [2] introduced the following useful definition. A Steiner tree is k-restricted, if every its full component is a k-tree. Let ST k (S) denote a minimal k-restricted Steiner tree and st k (S) denote its cost. This way, ST 2 (S) is the minimum spanning tree M ST (S). <p> This way, ST 2 (S) is the minimum spanning tree M ST (S). By (1), the gain of any k-restricted Steiner tree is nonpositive in &lt; S; D [E k &gt;, therefore, st k (S) t k (S) <ref> [2] </ref>. These values may not coincide: In the rectilinear plane, for the set S = f (1; 0); (0; 1)g, st 3 (S) = 5 and t 3 (S) = 4:5. <p> For NSP, some r k were evaluated in [16, 1, 6] and, finally, Brochers and Du [5] proved that for k = 2 r + l, r k = sup s (r + 1)2 r + l : (3) For the rectilinear metric, r k 2k 2k1 for r 3 <ref> [2] </ref>, moreover, for any instance of RSP, t 2 + t 4 2:5s and 3t 2 + 4t 3 9s [3]. The bounds for t k and r k combined with the bound (2) give the preformance 3 guarantee of GA and k-BR mentioned in the previous section. <p> In the graph G 0 obtained, we can choose a minimum spanning tree M in which any pair u; v 2 S is connected by paths containing only terminals of S. It is proved in <ref> [2] </ref> that the d (M ) = mst (G 0 ) = mst (G) and for any k-tree K, the cost of R (K) is the same in G and G 0 . Consider a subgraph H of G 0 induced by the vertax set S. <p> Berman and Ramaiyer <ref> [2] </ref> proved that the output tree of the usual r-BR has a gain at least P r t i1 t i i1 (compare with (2)). This proof does not use any properties of the cost function d on k-trees except the properties above.

Reference-contexts: Such a constant c must exist since NSP is SN P -complete <ref> [4] </ref>. We prove that c lies somewhere below 1.644... for that problem. Note that we do not know at the moment whether RSP is also SN P -complete, and therefore it could have a polynomial time approximation scheme.

Reference-contexts: If T is not full, it can be decomposed into full Steiner trees for subsets of terminals that overlap only at leaves. Such subtrees are called full Steiner components of T <ref> [9] </ref>. k-trees are full Steiner trees with at most k terminals. Without loss of generality, we may assume that the metric d on the set of terminals S is the shortest-path distance for the weighted edges D connecting S.

Reference-contexts: However, finding such a tree is NP-hard for almost all interesting metrics, like Euclidean, rectilinear, Hamming distance, shortest-path distance in a graph etc. Because these problems have many applications, they were subject of extensive research <ref> [12] </ref>. In the last two decades many approximation algorithms for finding Steiner minimum trees appeared. The quality of an approximation algorithm is measured by its performance ratio (PR): an upper bound of the ratio between the achieved length and the optimal length.
