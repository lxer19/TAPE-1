Abstract: We describe a new approach for statistical modeling and detection of discourse structure for natural conversational speech. Our model is based on 42 `Dialog Acts' (DAs), (question, answer, backchannel, agreement, disagreement, apology, etc). We labeled 1155 conversations from the Switchboard (SWBD) database (Godfrey et al. 1992) of human-to-human telephone conversations with these 42 types and trained a Dialog Act detector based on three distinct knowledge sources: sequences of words which characterize a dialog act, prosodic features which characterize a dialog act, and a statistical Discourse Grammar. Our combined detector, although still in preliminary stages, already achieves a 65% Dialog Act detection rate based on acoustic waveforms, and 72% accuracy based on word transcripts. Using this detector to switch among the 42 Dialog-Act-Specific trigram LMs also gave us an encouraging but not statistically significant reduction in SWBD word error.

Reference-contexts: Each utterance thus received exactly one of these 220 tags. The average conversation consisted of 144 turns, 271 utterances, and took 28 minutes for trained CU Boulder grad students to label. The labeling agreement was 84% ( = .80; <ref> (Carletta 1996) </ref>). We then clustered these 220 tags into 42 final tags. All of our experiments were run with this 42-tag tagset.

Reference-contexts: grammar, and prosody), show how these knowledge sources can be combined, and finally apply the detector to help improve word recognition of SWBD. 2 Manual Discourse Tagging In order to tag the 1155 SWBD conversations, we first designed the SWBD-DAMSL tagset (Jurafsky et al. 1997b) by augmenting the DAMSL tag-set <ref> (Core and Allen 1997) </ref>. Our SWBD-DAMSL tagset consists of approximately 60 groupable labels in orthogonal dimensions which the labelers combined to produce 220 unique tags for the 205,000 SWBD utterances.

Reference-contexts: We used no word information in extracting or computing features, other than the location of utterance boundaries which were assumed for all knowledge sources. Features included duration, pause, F0, energy (RMS and signal-to-noise-ratio), and speaking rate (using a signal processing measure `enrate' <ref> (Morgan et al. 1997) </ref>) measures. Because the distribution of DAs was highly skewed,we downsampled our data to uniform priors (train and test) to train more discriminate trees. We built trees to detect specifically confusable dialog acts including Yes-No-Questions, and Abandoned/Turn Exits.
