Abstract: Consider a network facility location problem where congestion arises at facilities, and is represented by delay functions that approximate the queueing process. We strive to minimize the sum of customers' transportation and waiting times, and facilities' fixed and variable costs. The problem is solved using a column generation technique within a Branch-and-Bound scheme. Numerical results are reported and a bilevel (user-optimized) formulation considered, among other extensions.

Reference-contexts: In our model, congestion takes place at facilities and is characterized by delay functions that approximate the mean delay experienced by users attending a given facility. Demand at a node need not be assigned to a unique facility. According to Brandeau and Chiu's taxonomy (see Table 2 in <ref> [1] </ref>) our model would fit into the categories 1.

SYSTEM PARAMETERS: Travel Time (Deterministic, Continuous, Cost-Independent, Time-Invariant), Number of Service Facilities, Server Location (Finite, Deterministic, Nonzero Fixed Cost), Server Capacity (Capacitated).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we present an extension of the basic fixed demand, single commodity mul-tifacility location problem considered, in particular, by Erlenkotter <ref> [3] </ref> and Korkel [5].

Reference-contexts: Recently Branch-and-Bound algorithms have been designed for the mixed integer linear bilevel programming problem, but are only able to address small problems (see Moore and Bard [10]).

Reference-contexts: In this case it might be more efficient to apply Benders' decomposition, since fixing the y j -variables yields a convex assignment problem with the same bipartite network structure as the separable spatial equilibrium problem, for which efficient solution procedures have been developed (see Marcotte, Marquis and Zubieta <ref> [8] </ref>). If the tactical part of the model is dominant, it can be conjectured that the number of Benders cuts will be small. The formulation of CFLP can be extended along several directions.

Reference-contexts: Numerical results on problems with as many as 400 potential facility locations and 57 demand points have been solved. The implementation has been realized in FORTRAN77 on a SUN workstation (model SPARC1) running under the UNIX operating system. The simplex code XMP developed by Marsten <ref> [9] </ref> has been adopted to solve the linear subproblems. The test problems have been designed to determine the influence of the size parameters m, n and p on running time, the latter being roughly proportional to the number of nodes explored in the Branch-and-Bound tree.

Reference-contexts: As in Erlenkotter [3] we choose to branch on the variables y j or, equivalently, on the quantities P j . In order to minimize the time spent in computing penalties (see Nemhauser and Wolsey <ref> [11] </ref> for a discussion of this classical topic and of the Branch-and-Bound strategy in general), we branch on the first fractional y j -variable.
