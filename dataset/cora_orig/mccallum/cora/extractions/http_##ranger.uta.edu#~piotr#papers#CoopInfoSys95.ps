Title: An Approach to User Modeling in Decision Support Systems

Abstract: Drawing on on our work in the area of distributed artificial intelligence, we put forth a framework for modeling a human user interacting with a knowledge-based system. We assume that the human user is situated in some decision making setting, and view the computer system as taking an active role in supporting the user's decision making and problem solving activities. The model the system has of the decision making situation and of the user can be applied to determine what the system should do, both in terms of the system's physical action, if such is possible, as well as in terms of the information that should be transmitted to the user. An important part of the user's model is the model that the user may have of the system itself, and, further, how the user may think it is being modeled by the system, and so on. Our framework, the Recursive Modeling Method (RMM), explicitly represents this nesting of models. RMM lets the system coordinate with the expected actions of the human user, and rationally choose an optimal form of communication.

Reference-contexts: While the concept of rationality as the behavior that maximizes the expected utility of action is purely normative, it also provides a good guidance to the majority of actually observed human behavior. As experimentally verified in various settings (see for example <ref> [34, 8] </ref>) humans do end up choosing among their alternative actions with probabilities that reflect the expected utilities of these alternatives in the normative sense. Thus, alternatives that have significantly higher expected utility then their next competitors are almost always chosen by human decision makers. <p> One of the simlest techniques that allow one to account for the occasional irrationality of the human user is to introduce another modeling parameter reflecting the extend to which the user's choice is likely to be the rational one in the situation at hand <ref> [8] </ref>. Within our approach in RMM this parameter is formally introduced into the solution method in the section below. 3 The Formalizm of Recursive Modeling In this section we provide a brief overwiev of the Recursive Modeling Method previously presented in [18, 19, 20].
