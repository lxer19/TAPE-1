Title: Abstract  
Abstract: Infants face the difficult problem of segmenting continuous speech into words without the benefit of a fully developed lexicon. Several information sources in speechprosody, semantic correlations, phonotactics, and so onmight help infants solve this problem. Research to date has focused on determining to which of these information sources infants might be sensitive, but little work has been done to determine the usefulness of each source. The computer simulations reported here are a first attempt to measure the usefulness of distributional and phonotactic information in adult and child-directed speech. The simulations hypothesize segmentations of speech into words; the best segmentation hypothesis is selected using the Minimum Description Length paradigm. Our results indicate that while there is some useful information in both phoneme distributions and phonotactic rules, the combination of both sources is most useful. Further, this combination of information sources is more useful for segmenting child-directed speech than adult-directed speech. The implications of these results for theories of lexical acquisition are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Inputs Two speech samples from each of three subjects were used in the simulations; in one sample a mother was speaking to her daughter and in the other, the same mother was speaking to the researcher. The samples were taken from the CHILDES database <ref> (MacWhinney & Snow, 1990) </ref> from studies reported in Bernstein (1982). Each sample was checked for consistent word spellings (e.g., ts was changed to its), then transcribed into an ASCII-based phonetic representation in a manner that guaranteed that each occurrence of a word was transcribed identically.
