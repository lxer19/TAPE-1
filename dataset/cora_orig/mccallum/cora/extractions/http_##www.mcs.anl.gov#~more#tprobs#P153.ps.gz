Reference-contexts: This formulation implies that x 0 (s) 2 + y 0 (s) 2 = 1, and thus we must have x (s) 2 + y (s) 2 1 for all s 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. In particular, if the inverse elastic rod problem has a solution then a 2 + b 2 1. Also note that since is the local angle of inclination, setting (1) = c 2 yields a rod with one or more loops. <p> The model simulates a thermal reaction process in a rigid material, where the process depends on a balance between chemically generated heat addition and heat transfer by conduction. Aris <ref> [1, pages-292-299] </ref> and Bebernes and Eberly [4], discuss this problem in the context of combustion problems. This problem is usually called the Bratu problem in the literature. <p> The problem is of the form f i (x) = n j=1 Z 1 T i () d; where T i is the i-th Chebyshev polynomial shifted to the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. In this problem any m n is allowed, but in the discussion below it is assumed that m = n. This problem was formulated by Fletcher [14]. The Chebyshev problem has a zero residual solution for 1 n 7 and for n = 9. <p> Such a zero residual solution can be obtained without difficulty from the standard starting point, but the problem becomes difficult to solve from the starting point 10x s unless bounds are imposed. Since the nodes are required to be in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, the bounds 0 x j 1 for 1 j n are natural. There seems to be a unique minimum of the least squares problem for n = 8 and n = 11. <p> This problem is the variational formulation of the boundary value problem v (x) = exp [v (x)]; x 2 D; v (x) = 0; x 2 @D where is the Laplacian operator. Aris <ref> [1, pages-292-299] </ref> and Bebernes and Eberly [4], discuss this problem in the context of combustion problems. A local minimizer of the variational formulation is a solution of the boundary value problem. The converse of this statement fails. <p> The parameters nx and ny are the numbers of interior grid-points, n x and n y , in each of the respective coordinate directions. The parameter lambda is the Lagrange multiplier . Values of interest are 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; a typical value is = 0:008. The subroutine dodcps (t,mu1,mu2,t1,t2,result,task,lambda) computes ( p p p t)=t. Other functions can be obtained by modifying dodcps.

Reference-contexts: This problem was formulated by Huang [21]. In our formulation we have followed Ascher, Mattheij, and Russell <ref> [3, p. 7] </ref>.

A simple computation shows that in this representation v ij = u (j1) and that w ij = h i u (m+j1) Thus, bounds on a derivative of u at t i can be specified by bounding v ij or <p> In these plots, 0 = 1 and 1 = 1.

Reference-contexts: In the formulation of this problem, we follow Doria, Gubernatis and Rainer <ref> [12] </ref> by considering a homogeneous superconductor with a vector potential perpendicular to the superconductor. <p> If we choose w ( 1 ; 2 ) = 2n v 2 , then the vector potential also satisfies the line integral condition.

Reference-contexts: In the arclength continuation method used by Glowinski, Keller, and Reinhart <ref> [18] </ref>, the parameter is expressed in terms of arclength s, and the additional equation (u u k ) T (u k u k1 ) ( k )( k k1 ) is imposed. <p> This argument suggests that if s k s k1 is sufficiently small, then the augmented system will have a solution. The solution curve in Figure 2.7 was obtained by this arclength method. Glowinski, Keller, and Reinhart <ref> [18] </ref> use (2u k u k1 ; 2 k k1 ) as the starting point to obtain (u k+1 ; k+1 ). Our experience indicates that this choice of starting point is not crucial; we have used (u k ; k ). <p> Our experience indicates that this choice of starting point is not crucial; we have used (u k ; k ).

Reference-contexts: Our formulation follows the approach of Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna <ref> [19] </ref>.

The contour plot in Figure 4.5 and the plots of the region of homogenization in Figure 4.6 are similar to those obtained by Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna <ref> [19] </ref>. Note, however, that in these plots we used = 0:008, while Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna [19] used = 0:002. Another difference is that the homogenized region in these plots is connected, while this is not the case in the results of Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna [19]. 4.5 Inhomogeneous Superconductors: 1-D <p> The contour plot in Figure 4.5 and the plots of the region of homogenization in Figure 4.6 are similar to those obtained by Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna <ref> [19] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In all of these problems, we have only found one pair of solutions. If a unique solution is desired, the bound x 1 0 can be imposed.

Reference-contexts: The parameter p is the pressure in atmospheres and R expresses the relative amounts of air and fuel. In this problem n = 11, p = 40, and R = 10. In our formulation of this problem we have followed Meintjes and Morgan <ref> [27] </ref>.

This formulation, however, uses the element variables of Meintjes and Morgan <ref> [27] </ref> to avoid the square roots in the function evaluations. <p> In this problem n = 5, p = 40, and R = 10. (We note that there is a typographical error in the paper of Meintjes and Morgan <ref> [27] </ref>; the last term in the equation defining f 4 should be 4Rx 5 and not +4Rx 5 .)

Reference-contexts: In our formulation we have followed Dennis, Gay, and Vu [11]. They also propose a six-variable version of this problem, obtained by using the first two equations to eliminate two of the first four variables. Further reductions are possible. Indeed, Morgan, Sommese, and Watson <ref> [30] </ref> showed that the human heart problem can be reduced to the solution of one quadratic equation in one unknown. We have not implemented any of these reduced problems. There are five versions of the eight-variable problem depending on the data and the starting point.

Reference-contexts: If we choose w ( 1 ; 2 ) = 2n v 2 , then the vector potential also satisfies the line integral condition.

Reference-contexts: This approach can be quite challenging because the elastica is sensitive to end conditions, especially for more complicated shapes which require large forces and torques. See the discussion by Watson and Wang <ref> [40] </ref>. We solve the inverse elastic rod problem with a k-stage collocation method.

Reference-contexts: There is partial theoretical justification for the conjecture that the relationship between the global minimum of V 2 and n is nearly linear because Xue, Maier, and Rosen <ref> [41] </ref> have shown that the minimum energy function value has a linear lower bound of the form ffn for some positive constant ff if the minimum pair distance is bounded away from zero. <p> For example, the minimal configuration for n = 309 is 2007:21, while the global minimum predicted by v 3 is 2016:97. We also note that the computational results in Table 4.2 conform to the result of Xue, Maier, and Rosen <ref> [41] </ref> that the minimum energy function value has a linear lower bound of the form ffn for some positive constant ff if the minimum pair distance is bounded away from zero.
