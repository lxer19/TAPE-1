Reference-contexts: The next section describes our observations of the teaching of first-order logic in Stan-ford logic classes. A `control' natural deduction course is compared with a course taught using Hyperproof <ref> (Barwise & Etchemendy 1994) </ref>. Even prior to the question how logic should be presented to maximise learning, there is the question what is learnt when a student learns elementary logic? This question is brought into focus by the `paradox of logic learning'.

Reference-contexts: Q 1 and Q 2 may or may not be the same. The large psychological literature on fallacies of interpretation and reasoning mostly discusses errors of commission|cases where reasoners illicitly draw invalid conclusions. Our data reveals <ref> (Stenning et al. 1995) </ref> that errors of omission|failure to draw valid inferences|are just as prevalent, and more importantly, that the patterns of omission and commission are strongly correlated. Illicit inference in one circumstance is strongly correlated with failure to make a valid inference in another.
