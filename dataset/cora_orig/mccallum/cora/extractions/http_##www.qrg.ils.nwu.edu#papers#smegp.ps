Title: Making SME greedy and pragmatic

Abstract: The Structure-Mapping Engine (SME) has successfully modeled several aspects of human consistent interpretations of an analogy. While useful for theoretical explorations, this aspect of the algorithm is both psychologically implausible and computationally inefficient. (2) SME contains no mechanism for focusing on interpretations relevant to an analogizer's goals. This paper describes modifications to SME which overcome these flaws. We describe a greedy merge algorithm which efficiently computes an approximate "best" interpretation, and can generate alternate interpretations when necessary. We describe pragmatic marking, a technique which focuses the mapping to produce relevant, yet novel, inferences. We illustrate these techniques via example and evaluate their performance using empirical data and theoretical analysis. analogical processing. However, it has two significant drawbacks: (1) SME constructs all structurally

Reference-contexts: The idea is that (a) finding a global solution can be modeled as deciding which local solutions to include and (b) some indication of "quality" exists for ordering local solutions <ref> [1] </ref>. Roughly, it works like this: Pick the best local solution. This rules out other choices, namely those which are inconsistent with the one picked. Throw away those which are inconsistent with your first choice. Now augment your solution with the best of the remaining local solutions.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 describes pragmatic marking, analyzes its complexity, and illustrates it by example. Finally, we discuss our plans for future work. 2 How SME works Here we sketch the standard SME algorithm to provide the backdrop for our improvements (see <ref> [7] </ref> for details). SME takes as input two propositional descriptions, a base and a target. It produces as output a set of global interpretations (gmaps) of the comparision. <p> If p is the number of pmaps, there are at worst p! gmaps. This, of course, is expensive. Typical examples perform much better than this, due to the strong filtering effects of structural consistency. As <ref> [7] </ref> reports, on many complex examples SME takes only a few seconds of CPU time. However, we have found examples that can produce thousands of gmaps, and take days of CPU time to compute. Finally, the structural evaluation and candidate inferences for each gmap are computed. <p> However, we have found examples that can produce thousands of gmaps, and take days of CPU time to compute. Finally, the structural evaluation and candidate inferences for each gmap are computed. These operations are of low complexity <ref> [7] </ref>. The structural evaluation score computation is irrelevant for this paper, see [7,8] for details. The only important feature is that the structural score of a gmap is the sum of its M H 's scores, so it can easily be computed for pmaps and combined during merging.

As a simulation of Gentner's Structure-Mapping theory [9,10], SME has been used to model human soundness judgements [13], to study the representational and processing choices in analogical processing <ref> [8] </ref>, and as part of a model of sequence learning [14]. SME has also been used in an AI system which learns qualitative physics by analogy [3]. <p> But it is extremely implausible psychologically. There are in the worst case a factorial number of potential solutions, making exhaustive enumeration impossible under any reasonable assumptions about human processing constraints. Even for theoretical explorations, as we tackle more realistic representations (c.f., <ref> [8] </ref>) this aspect of SME has become a stumbling block. To use SME as a central component in larger-scale simulations and AI systems, a more practical algorithm is needed. Here we describe a greedy algorithm which efficiently provides good approximations to the "best" interpretation.

We view the ability to generate multiple interpretations of an analogy as critical. Even with a firm goal in mind, there can still be several ways to interpret an analogy (c.f. the Contras example in <ref> [12] </ref>). There are several ways that multiple interpretations could be generated. One algorithm we explored generated an approximation of the top n gmaps based on their structural evaluation. This is often not a good strategy.
