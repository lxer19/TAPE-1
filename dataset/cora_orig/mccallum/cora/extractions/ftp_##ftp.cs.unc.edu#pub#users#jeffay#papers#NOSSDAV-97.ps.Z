Abstract: Until mechanisms for true real-time network communications are deployed and pervasive, one must rely on adaptive, best-effort congestion control methods to provide acceptable levels of service for interactive, real-time multimedia applications. Here we report on our experiences with a novel media-scaling congestion control scheme that was implemented in an experimental version of the Intel ProShare TM videoconferencing system and tested over the Internet. The media scaling scheme is unique in that it employs two-dimensional media scaling the bit-rate and packet-rate of media streams are independently scaled. The goals of our study were (1) to empirically assess the performance improvement of two-dimensional media scaling over the simpler, and more commonly employed, one-dimensional scaling approaches and (2) to determine if it was possible to sustain ProShare conferences for a significant enough fraction of the time that two-dimensional scaling could be considered effective. We observed that systems using one-dimensional and two-dimensional scaling were both able to sustain conferences and that the two-dimensional scaling system always produced conferences with greater effective throughput. Our study provides empirical evidence that two-dimensional media scaling can be used effectively to ameliorate the effects of congestion in the Internet and can significantly extend the usability of an interactive multimedia application on the Internet. This paper presents the results of a set of experiments using an adaptive, best-effort videoconferencing system on the Internet. The system, a modified version of the Intel ProShare TM videoconferencing system, is novel in that it employs a two-dimensional media scaling algorithm to ameliorate the effects of congestion. Both the bit-rate of media streams and the partitioning of the streams into network packets (the packet-rate) are independently scaled [9]. Our goal in this work was not to attempt to construct a videoconferencing system that would provide acceptable quality conferences under all network conditions, but rather to build a system that could sustain conferences over a sizable Internet path under daytime traffic conditions and to use the system as a testbed for the evaluation and comparison of adaptive scaling schemes. In particular, we were interested in the comparison between two-dimensional scaling schemes and conventional one-dimensional scaling in the Internet environment. Our experience with this system and the experiments we performed highlight several of the issues surrounding real-time, low latency communications on current internet-works, and especially on the Internet itself. These issues include the practicality of videoconferencing on todays Internet, the applicability of adaptive scaling over a lengthy Internet path, the utility of two-dimensional scaling on the Internet, and the proper criteria for assessing the congestion control mechanisms of adaptive multimedia applications. Our experiments show at least some promise for high-quality, low latency videoconferencing on the Internet. Although peak-period traffic makes conferences with our system infeasible, there are certain times during an average weekday at which we were able to routinely sustain quality conferences. Our experiments also indicate that adaptive techniques are able to function over Internet paths of some complexity. In addition we are able to measure a qualitative benefit of two-dimensional scaling over one-dimensional scaling. The following section reviews the congestion control problem for interactive multimedia applications and describes some approaches reported in the literature for dealing with congestion. Section 3 presents the videoconfer-encing system used in this work and describes our two-dimensional media scaling scheme. Sections 4 and 5, respectively, describe our experimental method and the re
