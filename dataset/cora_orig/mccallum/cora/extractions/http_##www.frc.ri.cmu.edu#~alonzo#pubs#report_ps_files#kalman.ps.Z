Reference-contexts: In this model, the gyro drifts are considered to be the driving inputs. At this point, the state vector is given by the 3 vehicle position coordinates. However, the gyro drifts cannot reasonably be modelled as white sequences. It is necessary to augment the state vector. <ref> [1] </ref> suggests a random constant plus a Markov component with a large time constant for all three drift rates. This gives six additional state variables and six new differential equations. Where is a Markov process time constant, is a white noise process, and the subscripts m and 26.

Reference-contexts: The practical utility of the filter stems from its ability to estimate, say vehicle position, based on a number of measurements which are <ref> [2] </ref>: incomplete: related to some but not all of the variables of interest indirect: related indirectly to the quantities of interest intermittent: available at irregularly spaced instants of time inexact: corrupted by many forms of error A central idea in the Kalman filter is to model the system of interest as <p> In this context, the transition matrix can be thought of as an expression of whatever technique is used to solve the original nonlinear system differential equation, which is a subject in itself, outside of estimation theory. See the linear systems literature, for example, <ref> [2] </ref> for what little is known about this matter. For a nonlinear plant, this amounts to approximating the system model. 4.4.4 Linearized Filters A separate matter dealt with in estimation theory is the propagation of uncertainty when the plant is nonlinear.

Reference-contexts: The Kalman filter equations for the system model are as follows: The proof that these equations constitute an optimal filter is remarkably straightforward for an algorithm that is only 30 years old. It is provided in <ref> [3] </ref>. The equations are not run all at once. The last two run at high frequency and the first three are run when measurements are available. For the first three, the process is started by entering the prior estimate and its covariance . <p> A square nXn matrix of rank n is called nonsingular. The rank of the product of matrices is never larger than the smallest rank of the matrices forming the product. 3.

Reference-contexts: Fundamentals of the Discrete Kalman Filter The Kalman filter was invented by R.E. Kalman and first published in about 1960 <ref> [6] </ref>. It is a method of estimating the state of a system based on recursive measurement of noisy data. The filter comes in many forms, including continuous and discrete time variants and linear and nonlinear variants. <p> Just as Kalman filtering is an estimation process, calibration of a sensor is an estimation process in its own right. The rules for calibration have not changed since Gauss first wrote them when he invented least squares in 1795 <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Formally, a system is observable if the initial state can be determined by the observing the output for some finite period of time. Generalizing from Gelb <ref> [7] </ref>, consider the discrete, nth order, constant coefficient linear system: for which there are m noise free measurements: where each is an m X n matrix.

Reference-contexts: AHRS Dead Reckoning System Model This section begins the business of writing out the math. The rest of the document depends heavily on the kinematic notation and relationships set out in a separate document <ref> [9] </ref>. Most of the measurement and system model is a 3D kinematic model.

This transition matrix is just the equations of 3D dead reckoning. Formally, this matrix has been generated by reexpressing the nonlinear plant as a matrix function of the states.
