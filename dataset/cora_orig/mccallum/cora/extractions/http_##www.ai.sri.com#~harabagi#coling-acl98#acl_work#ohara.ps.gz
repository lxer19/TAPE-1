Title: Lexical Acquisition with WordNet and the Mikrokosmos Ontology

Abstract: This paper discusses an approach to augmenting a lexicon for knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT) with information derived from WordNet. The Mikrokosmos project at NMSU's Computing Research Laboratory has concentrated on the creation of the Spanish and Japanese lexicons, so the English lexicon is less developed. We investigated using WordNet as a means to automate portions of the English lexicon development. Several heuristics are used to find the WordNet synonym sets corresponding to the concepts in the Mikrokos-mos language-independent ontology. Two of these heuristics exploit the WordNet is-a hierarchy: one performs hierarchical matching of both taxonomies, and the other computes similarity based on frequency of defining words and their ancestors in a corpus. The result is a lexicon acquisition tool that produces plausible lexical mappings from English words into the Mikrokosmos ontology. Initial performance results are included, which indicate good accuracy in the mappings.

The idea is to take advantage of the time-consuming classification work already done. Acknowledgements The WordNet support code uses the CommonLisp interface developed by Mark Nahabedian of MIT.

Reference-contexts: A definition match compares overlap of the LDOCE definition text to those of both the WordNet entry and its hypernym along with the words from closely-related synsets. Their hierarchy match uses the implicit hierarchy within LDOCE defined from the genus terms of the definitions, incorporating work done at NMSU <ref> (Bruce and Guthrie, 1991) </ref> that identifies and disambiguates the head nouns in the definition texts. The hierarchy is used to guide the determination of nontrivial matches by providing local context in which senses can be considered unambiguous by filtering out the other senses not applicable to either subhierarchy.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, text corpora from the specific application domain should be used for train-ing and testing. In the Mikrokosmos project, this type of information has been consulted during the development of the language-independent ontology, most of which was created manually <ref> (Mahesh and Nirenburg, 1995) </ref>. Therefore, it is conceivable to automate much of the lexical acquisition by mapping entries from MRD's into concepts from the ontology.

Reference-contexts: The main reason is that mapping into a language-neutral ontology facilitates richer text meaning representations that are not tied to the specifics of particular languages. For more details on this and other benefits of KBMT see <ref> (Nirenburg et al., 1992) </ref>. 1.2 Overview of the Solution Overall, the algorithm is fairly straightforward and incorporates few domain-specific dependencies. To begin with, the mapping algorithm does not perform parsing or pattern matching of the definition entries but instead relies on the conventions used in the ontology development.

Reference-contexts: Atkins (1995) estimates that it would take 100 person-years to properly develop a semantic lexical database comparable in scope to a standard college dictionary. Lexicons are a key component of machine translation systems <ref> (Onyshkevych and Nirenburg, 1994) </ref>. The Mikrokosmos (K) project at NMSU's Computing Research Laboratory is developing Spanish, Chi-nese and Japanese lexicons to support knowledge-based machine translation (KBMT). <p> Note also that the definition assumes the reader knows what the actual sound is like and just needs to know enough to distinguish it from similar sounds, such as from a flute. As indicated in <ref> (Nirenburg, 1994) </ref>, relying solely on MRD's will not yield a lexicon sufficient for realistic applications. These need to be fortified with machine-readable versions of other reference sources, such as thesauri, collocation lists, and perhaps even encyclopedias. <p> For instance, it includes theme and instrument relations, as well as the more usual is-a and set-membership relations; the ontology also contains selectional restrictions on case roles. In contrast, the lexicon contains just the information needed to realize a concept in a given language <ref> (Onyshkevych and Nirenburg, 1994) </ref>. It will contain the usual information about morphology and syntax; but, most of the semantics will be defined in terms of a concept from the ontology.
