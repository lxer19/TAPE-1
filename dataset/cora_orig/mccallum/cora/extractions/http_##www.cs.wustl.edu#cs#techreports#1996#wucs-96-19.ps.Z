Abstract: This report describes an atm Multipoint Connection Caching strategy (amcc) to control the explosive growth of traffic within the network and at an endpoint in a large Distributed Interactive Simulation (dis) application such as a battlefield simulation. For very large dis applications with 100,000 entities, the current method of broadcasting information among entities will no longer be feasible due to computational and network bandwidth limitations. Our scheme divides the simulation space into grids and each grid square or a set of grid squares forms a multicast group. Entities join the groups within their perception range and thus, they receive state updates only from entities within their perception range. amcc utilizes the unique capabilities of our dynamic multipoint ATM signaling protocol, CMAP. We have implemented amcc and have successfully demonstrated a small dis battlefield simulation application running over our atm testbed.

Reference-contexts: For our implementation, we used a commercial Bay Networks switch and thus did not have the luxury to implement the solution outlined above since it requires a change in the switch architecture. Currently, the ATM Forum <ref> [1, 2] </ref> has proposed using point-to-multipoint 1 Of course, if the revised ATM standard protocols provide the necessary capabilities, we would use them as opposed to our own non-standard protocols. 8 connections only.

Reference-contexts: This leads to savings in processing resources and memory. Second, a join signaling message to a multipoint connection can be terminated at the first node in its path towards the source. This leads to reduced latency in signaling along with near optimal multipoint connection tree [12]. In <ref> [3, 5] </ref>, further discussions are presented for the necessity of leaf-initiated joins for a scalable multicast service. Thus another key aspect required of the signaling protocol is that it support leaf-initiated joins and drops. <p> Due to this, cells from both hosts can get interleaved before they reach host C which means that host C can no longer use hardware re-assembly which would lead to severe performance degradation. This problem of source discrimination in a many-to-many connection over atm has been discussed in <ref> [3, 5, 6] </ref>. In [10], the authors propose to use "packet" switching at nodes which have a multicast connection with multiple transmitters. In this approach, they take advantage of the fact that AAL5 has an end-of-packet identifier as part of the atm header.

Reference-contexts: The Connection Management Access Protocol (cmap), the most relevant for this project, allows network clients to create, manipulate and delete multipoint, multiconnection communication channels, which we term calls <ref> [4] </ref>. A call is a distributed object maintained by the network which describes the communication paths that interconnect clients. A multipoint call is a call involving two or more clients; a point-to-point call is a special case of a multipoint call involving only two clients.

This architecture attempts to solve many of the important problems that confront atm network control engineers by providing uniform Application Programmer Interlaces (apis) at each of the software layers, thereby encapsulating and concealing vendor-specific interfaces.
