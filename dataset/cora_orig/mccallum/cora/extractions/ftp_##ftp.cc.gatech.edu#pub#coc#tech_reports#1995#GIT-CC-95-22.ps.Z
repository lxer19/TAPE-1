Abstract: Much of our current understanding of the operational aspects and the network requirements of multicast communication derives from the MBone. As an experimental network that overlays the Internet, the MBone has served as the testbed for multicast protocols. This work has led to the development of audio and video conferencing tools that have been used extensively recently. This paper describes our efforts in developing and using a measurement tool, called Mlisten, for characterizing the dynamic behavior in MBone sessions. Such a characterization will be of great benefit in understanding how any future networking infrastructure with multicast and real-time capabilities will be used. We discuss the challenges in monitoring MBone session participation and report on a methodology for pre-processing observed data to make it better reflect the true behavior of members in an MBone session. We also report on the results of using Mlisten to determine temporal, geographical and resource usage characteristics of several recent MBone sessions.

Reference-contexts: Multicast communication is necessary as a means to provide a variety of communication services such as video and audio conferencing, computer supported collaborative work and wide-scale information dissemination. Much of our current understanding of the operational aspects and the network support requirements of multicast communication <ref> [1] </ref> derives from the MBone [2]. As an experimental network that overlays the Internet, the MBone has served as the testbed for many ideas. <p> The MBone is a virtual network that overlays the Internet. Some links of the MBone network are actually unicast tunnels between multicast-capable routers. Each tunnel may actually consist 3 of several Internet links. Routing in the MBone is performed using the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) <ref> [11, 1] </ref>. Even though the MBone is still an unstable, experimental network, the transmission of programs or conferences has been a daily occurrence for some time [13]. Information about conferences or other events is announced by periodically transmitted messages over the MBone.

Reference-contexts: Much of our current understanding of the operational aspects and the network support requirements of multicast communication [1] derives from the MBone <ref> [2] </ref>. As an experimental network that overlays the Internet, the MBone has served as the testbed for many ideas. <p> The paper is concluded in Section 7. 2 Conferencing on the MBone MBone Overview. The MBone is an experimental virtual network that provides the means for multicasting data to any number of connected hosts <ref> [2] </ref>. One of the primary objectives of the MBone is to test the real-time, one-to-many delivery of audio- and video-conferencing data. A wide variety of multimedia applications can theoretically be supported, but the large-scale application most commonly demonstrated is that of lecture- or program-style sessions.

Reference-contexts: As an experimental network that overlays the Internet, the MBone has served as the testbed for many ideas. Most prominent is the development of a set of audio and video conferencing tools <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] </ref> that have been used extensively in the last few years to multicast conferences, talks, radio broadcasts, concerts, Space Shuttle missions, and working group meetings. <p> Even though the MBone is still an unstable, experimental network, the transmission of programs or conferences has been a daily occurrence for some time [13]. Information about conferences or other events is announced by periodically transmitted messages over the MBone. Using the Session Directory (SD) tool <ref> [3] </ref>, MBone users can see what sessions are active, and find out about other scheduled MBone broadcasts. <p> One UDP port is used for transmitting audio data, and the second for member name information. It is this latter information that we are interested in collecting. This second UDP port, or control port, is typically the advertised data port number plus one <ref> [3, 8] </ref>. When an audio tool is started, two pairs of UDP port numbers are used; one pair each to receive and transmit control messages and data.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the MBone and the audio conferencing tools used. Section 3 describes the collection of session membership data.

Reference-contexts: A unique aspect of this analysis is that we observe how the tree characteristics change over the lifetime of a session. In our analysis to follow we consider several types of trees. Our cost metric is that of packet-hops (first used in <ref> [14] </ref>) which is simply the sum, over all the links, of the number of packets carried over each link for each multicast. For example, a multicast from one source to multiple destinations will have a cost in packet-hops equal to the number of links in the tree. <p> The routes in the MBone tree are roughly approximated using the MWatch tool [10]. The multicast hop count is compared to the number of packet hops in the same tree but assuming that the source transmits to each receiver individually (also known as the separately-addressed packets scheme <ref> [14] </ref>). 2. MBone Tree with Georgia Tech host as the Source: In order to assess the sensitivity of tree costs to the location of the source we repeat the calculations for both 1 and 2 above but assume a host at Georgia Tech was the source.

Reference-contexts: So in order to estimate an Internet hop cost we would like 17 be able to determine the actual cost of a tree as if it were running on a fully multicast-capable Internet. For this, we considered a Georgia Tech host as the source and use the traceroute <ref> [15] </ref> utility to determine the shortest path 4 . We use this tree to determine the appropriate unicast and multicast costs.
