Abstract: In this paper we propose a formal framework to model rational agents. We distinguish four levels where aspects of agency are situated, viz. the informational, action, motivational and social level. On these levels we consider concepts like knowledge and belief of agents, opportunities for, and results of actions that they may perform, preferences, goals, intentions and commitments, and speech acts. The language describing these concepts is a multi-modal one, and the models used to interpret this language are Kripke-style possible worlds models. Both the language and the models are defined in a rigorously formal way, while the actual semantics are only sketched. We conclude this paper with a brief comparison with related work on the formalisation of rational agents.

Reference-contexts: Research on this subject has held the limelight ever since the pioneering work of Moore [12] in which knowledge and actions are considered. Over the years contributions have been made on both informational attitudes like knowledge and belief [11] and motivational attitudes like intentions and commitments <ref> [1, 4] </ref>.

We characterise this integrated framework by pointing out some differences with the formalisations proposed by Cohen & Levesque <ref> [1] </ref> and Rao & Georgeff [13], respectively. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we single out the concepts that in our opinion constitute agency. As mentioned above, these concepts are situated at four different levels. <p> f )(i)]f * j= auth (i; j) ^ B i f !

The main difference between our approach and the one of Cohen & Levesque is that they define intentions in terms of goals and beliefs. We agree with this approach when it concerns intentions on propositions.

In this theory we model both the communication itself as well as the consequences of communication. <p> We treat the motivational kind of commitment as a special instance of the social kind. As the result of i performing a COM M IT (i; j; ff) action the formula O ij ff becomes true (cf. <ref> [3] </ref>), i.e. by committing itself to an action, an agent i obliges itself towards j to perform the action ff. The commitment is a private one if j is the same as i.

Following <ref> [4, 9] </ref> we base this model on dynamic logic [5], which is extended with epistemic, doxastic, temporal and deontic (motivational) operators. The semantics will be based on Kripke structures with a variety of relations imposed on the states. <p> This relation connects each world with the set of ideal worlds with respect to that world. More details about the formal semantics of this deontic operator can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. 2.4 The social level The COM M IT action described in the previous section is one of the four types of speech acts [14] that play a role at the social level. Speech acts deal with aspects of communication.

The results of actions are modelled using concepts from dynamic logic <ref> [5] </ref>: [ff (i)]OE indicates that if agent i performs the action indicated by ff the result will be OE. Note that it does not state anything about whether the action will actually be performed.

The complete semantics contains an algebraic interpretation of action expresses, based on the action semantics of Meyer <ref> [10] </ref>. In this abstract we will refrain from the algebraic interpretation of actions and instead interpret actions as functions on states of affairs. For the meta-actions the state-transition interpretation is not adequate, because meta-actions do not change states, but relations between states.

Speech acts deal with aspects of communication. The result of a speech act is a change in the doxastic or deontic state of an agent, or in some cases a change in the state of the world.
