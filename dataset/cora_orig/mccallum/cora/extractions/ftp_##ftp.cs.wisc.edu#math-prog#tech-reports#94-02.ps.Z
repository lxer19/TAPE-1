Abstract: We are concerned with solving affine variational inequalities defined by a linear map A and a polyhedral set C. Most of the existing pivotal methods for such inequalities or mixed linear complementarity problems depend on the existence of extreme points in C or a certain non-singularity property of A with respect to the lineality of C. In this paper, we prove that if A is copositive-plus with respect to the recession cone of C, then the lineality space can be removed without any further assumptions. The reductions given here extend the currently known pivotal methods to solve affine variational inequalities or prove that no solution exists, whenever A is copositive-plus withe respect to the recession cone of C.

Reference-contexts: The solutions of such problems arise for example in the determination of Newton-type methods for variational inequalities and mixed complementarity problems. In <ref> [1] </ref>, (AVI) was treated as the piecewise linear equation A C (x) = a; (NE) where A C is the normal map A C (x) := A ( C (x)) + x C (x): 1 This material is based on research supported by the National Science Foundation Grant CCR-9157632 and the <p> The equivalence of these formulations arises from the observation [4] that if x solves (NE) then C (x) solves (AVI) and if z solves (AVI), then z + a Az solves (NE). A path following method was used in <ref> [1] </ref> to find a solution of (NE), based on properties of the normal manifold [11]. The algorithm is a realization of a more general scheme due to Eaves [5], which can be thought of as a generalization of the pivotal method due to Lemke [9]. <p> Our reductions are constructive and hence can be used in an algorithm that will construct a solution of an equation determined by a copositive-plus normal map. In particular, the algorithm given in <ref> [1] </ref> will construct a solution or determine that no solution exists, in this case. The reductions given here could also be used to extend the algorithms for solving affine variational inequalities using path following methods found in [2, 3, 6, 7, 13, 14]. A word about our notation. <p> Further details of our notation can be found in [12]. 2. Basic Reduction Techniques In <ref> [1] </ref> we gave a pivotal algorithm that will solve any affine variational inequality (AVI) determined by a copositive-plus matrix, provided that lin C = ;. <p> This algorithm was extended to find solutions of equations determined by copositive-plus normal maps for which W &gt; AW was invertible, where W represented a basis for lin C <ref> [1, Corollary 4.5] </ref>. The purpose of this paper is to remove the last assumption. We first outline some of the reductions that were used in [1] since they will be used again here but in a more careful manner. <p> The purpose of this paper is to remove the last assumption. We first outline some of the reductions that were used in <ref> [1] </ref> since they will be used again here but in a more careful manner. The first idea is to change bases so that lin C = IR jflj . Suppose that C = fz : Bz bg. <p> The first idea is to change bases so that lin C = IR jflj . Suppose that C = fz : Bz bg. Then lin C = ker B, and it is easy to construct an orthonormal basis for ker B using a QR factorization (see <ref> [1] </ref>). Let this basis be extended through (lin C) ? to an orthonormal basis of IR n , say P . <p> Define w := (Q &gt; L (a AQ L ? Q &gt; and note that Q L w 2 L. Hence, from Lemma 2.1, C (Q w # " Q L ? Q &gt; # The result now follows from elementary algebra. The reduction given in <ref> [1] </ref> is now immediate from Proposition 2.2 by letting L = lin C and then solving (3) under the assumption that A flfl = Q &gt; L AQ L is invertible. We now exhibit a more careful reduction that also uses Proposition 2.2. <p> Notice that ffi can be determined easily from a single QR factorization (see (2)) so that A and C can be easily formed. Furthermore, the path following algorithm of <ref> [1] </ref> can be used to solve the reduced problem. The fact that A is copositive-plus with respect to rec C guarantees that this algorithm will process the reduced problem. <p> Thus we have the following result. Theorem 3.5. Let A 2 IR nfin and C be a nonempty polyhedral set, such that A is copositive-plus with respect to rec C. The algorithm given in <ref> [1] </ref>, applied to (10), solves (NE) or determines that no solution exists. Proof. Let C = fz : Bz bg. First find ffi and fl by performing a QR factorization to determine a basis of ker B. Reduce the original problem to form (2). <p> Factor out the contribution from D and reduce the problem to the form given as (8). By noting Lemma 3.3, reduce (8) to the form of (10). (10) is solvable (or demonstrably not solvable) by the algorithm of <ref> [1] </ref>. 10 4. Conclusions We have shown in the proof of Theorem 3.5 how to reduce any equation determined by a copositive-plus normal map to one with zero lineality. The resulting equation can be solved or proven infeasible using the variant Lemke's algorithm given in [1]. <p> solvable) by the algorithm of <ref> [1] </ref>. 10 4. Conclusions We have shown in the proof of Theorem 3.5 how to reduce any equation determined by a copositive-plus normal map to one with zero lineality. The resulting equation can be solved or proven infeasible using the variant Lemke's algorithm given in [1]. A corresponding solution of (AVI) can be reconstructed from the solution of the reduced problem. An outstanding research question is whether the analysis given in this paper can be extended to the case of normal maps determined L-matrices (with respect to rec C).
