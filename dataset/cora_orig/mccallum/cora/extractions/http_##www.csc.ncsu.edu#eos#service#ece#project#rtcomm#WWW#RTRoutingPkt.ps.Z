Abstract: Support for real-time multimedia applications is becoming an essential requirement for packet-switched networks. In this work, we investigated how routing and admission control influence the performance of packet-switched networks. We propose and evaluate the use of routing algorithms which take into account the constraints imposed by the admission control algorithms. Routing algorithms proposed elsewhere in literature are also evaluated. We show that the new algorithms decrease call blocking probability and increase network utilization. The amount of iprovement depends on such factors as the admission control function, the traffic mix, and the QOS constraints. We evaluated two deterministic methods of Call Admission Control: Earliest Due Date and Stop&Go. We studied the effect of lossy source traffic shaping on routing. The interaction and relative importance of routing, admission control, and traffic shaping was also studied.

These two methods were chosen because they are deterministic, which means that traffic losses in the network are eliminated (and thus don't have to be calculated, or simulated).

Earliest Due Date packet scheduling is used at each node, based on these local "deadlines". <p> The EDD policy was shown to perform poorly in the presence of a heterogeneous traffic mix; the Stop&Go policy was much less affected by the traffic mix. Note that we did not implement the full EDD scheme, because of its exponential worst case time complexity <ref> [5] </ref>. The full EDD scheme will undoubtably perform significantly better.

Reference-contexts: To accomodate delays as well as scheduling costs, we would like to have a routing algorithm which finds a path with minimal delay as well as minimal total cost. Unfortunately this problem is NP-complete <ref> [6] </ref>. Instead an approximation called the Min Max Cost with Delay Bound (MMCDB) algorithm was developed. This algorithm finds a path which has minimum value of the maximum cost of any link in the path, while also satisfying the end-to-end delay bound. Details are withheld for lack of space.

Reference-contexts: For our studies, end-to-end delay was the main QOS metric, while packet loss was handled using traffic shaping as discussed earlier. Link bandwidth was the main network resource sought to be optimized; we assumed flow control would make buffer space a less important consideration. Hwang et al <ref> [9] </ref> have suggested the use of some circuit-switching routing techniques for high speed multimedia networks; we also evaluated two of thos algorithms. 3.1 Shortest Path Type Routing Algorithms For these algorithms, for each new channel admission request a reduced network graph is formed. <p> The C STAT algorithm is a static router which selects the preset minimum hop path for a channel. The C DYN algorithm is a dynamic router in which link utilizations are used as the link lengths. 3.2 Algorithms based on Circuit-switched network routing Hwang et al <ref> [9] </ref> propose the use of routers similar to those used in circuit switched networks for routing in integrated services networks. Rather than perform a shortest path calculation, these algorithms send the request message outwards from the origin node. <p> In the Sequential Office Control (SOC) algorithm, the call is blocked if all the outgoing links from a node are blocked, while the Crankback (CB) algorithm allows backtracking. Details are given in <ref> [9] </ref>. Rampal: An Evaluation of Routing & Admission Control : : : 7 4 Simulation Model and Experimental Method Simulation techniques were used to evaluate the routing algorithms. The simulations were performed in a static environment with the assumption of infinite call holding times and negligible call processing times.

Reference-contexts: We investigated the use of the two rate based flow control schemes along with traffic shaping at the inputs. Figure 2 shows the model of one output link of a switch in such a scheme. The simple leaky bucket <ref> [13] </ref> is used for traffic shaping (packets queue but not tokens). The token generation rate of a leaky bucket is set to the equivalent rate of the source required for a given size of the shaper buffer and given allowable loss.

Reference-contexts: The emphasis of this paper is to examine this interaction between routing and call admission for multimedia traffic. Very little work appears to have been done on this problem to date. Some ideas on routing algorithms for real-time channels have been proposed by Parris and Ferrari <ref> [14] </ref>, but not investigated quantitatively. Kompella et al [11] have investigated some related routing problems for multicasting of real-time data. <p> The motivation for this approach is that a path with minimal delays corresponds to a lightly loaded path, and hence load balancing is also achieved. The SP algorithm was first proposed in <ref> [14] </ref>. However, no quantitative evaluation was presented. The Shortest Cost router (SC) An algorithm which seeks to meet end-to-end delays may not be suited for a situation where delays are not critical. <p> No consideration is given to meeting the end-to-end delay bound at all. Other Routing Algorithms The Minimum Hop with Delay Bounds (MHDB) algorithm finds a minimum hop path which also satisfies the end-to-end delay constraints. (this can be done using the Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [14] </ref>). To accomodate delays as well as scheduling costs, we would like to have a routing algorithm which finds a path with minimal delay as well as minimal total cost. Unfortunately this problem is NP-complete [6].
