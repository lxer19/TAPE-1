Title: A Navigator for Archived MBone Sessions  
Author: Suchitra Raman and Angela Schuett 
Address: Berkeley  
Affiliation: University of California,  
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a collaborative library (colibrary), an archive system for recording and playback of distributed collaborative sessions on the MBone. Designed as a suite of tools, the colibrary provides mechanisms for recording, playback, annotation, and navigation of MBone sessions, including audio, video and shared whiteboard streams. The archived sessions are available for playback through a fault-tolerant, cluster-based server designed to support large numbers of clients. The archive navigator allows users to create and share spatial as well as temporal bookmarks and annotations. We also present novel mechanisms for automatic indexing of stored MBone content. All of these components have been designed in an extensible fashion, to allow new indexing and archive access mechanisms to be easily implemented and tested.

Reference-contexts: Playback data is sent using the same protocols used for live transmissions, namely RTP and SRM. A number of MBone archival systems exist <ref> [14, 2] </ref>. Our system differs in several ways. First, we provide a more sophisticated access interface, described in the rest of the paper. In addition, our archive system has the capability to record and playback sessions which include shared whiteboard data (from mb).

Reference-contexts: All 14 lectures were recorded. All of this content was made available through the colibrary system. 2.2 Server Architecture The colibrary archive system is based on a client/server architecture. The server is implemented on a cluster of PC's using the AS1 active service toolkit <ref> [3] </ref>. Figure 2 shows the architecture of the server. A number of server component machines are connected via a high-speed backbone (we currently use a 100Base-T Ethernet link) to a disk system.

Reference-contexts: For example, the cue Raise hand is transmitted when a user wants to ask a question. This information along with the talk spurt detection algorithm can help classify some spurts as questions. In addition, mediaboard text items are indexed by content, and support advanced querying to the end user <ref> [4] </ref>. 6 Extensibility One of the main goals of the colibrary system is that the components be extensible to support a variety of applications, and to allow easy incorporation of advanced components. Toward this end, we have designed and implemented this system as a number of composable objects.

Reference-contexts: Intelligent indexing algorithms that analyze the archived data and automatically generate indexes or bookmarks are also important when searching large archives of session data.

Reference-contexts: The audio and video transmission tools nv, nevot, vic and vat use the real-time transport protocol (RTP) [23], while the shared whiteboard tools wb and mb use the scalable, reliable multicast protocol (SRM) <ref> [7] </ref> for data delivery. To improve the MBone tools, support for recording and replaying collaborations is required. In addition, the ability to navigate and annotate these recordings is required to make the system a more useful collaboration aid.

Reference-contexts: We have introduced several simple but powerful mechanisms for automatically generating presentation annotations. We are planning to extend this to include more indexing methods, and more ways to display annotations, for example in a per source display similar to the VMS system <ref> [9] </ref>. In addition, we would like to improve mechanisms for clients to decide which indices to view. We are continuing to use the system regularly to record and view research meetings and presentations. We have been soliciting and incorporating feedback from other users of the system.

Reference-contexts: Each class meeting was multicast, and between 5-8 students attended each class remotely, using vic, vat, and mb. The class was conducted in a room with several controllable cameras, allowing remote participants to have several views 2 of the in-room speaker and participants. The classroom also contained a LiveBoard <ref> [15] </ref> with pen input. This was used by the speaker for displaying slides and annotating them. The shared whiteboard application, mb, carried this data to remote participants, who were also able to add annotations and type messages. All 14 lectures were recorded.

Reference-contexts: We have been using the system to archive research meetings and seminars. In addition, the system was used to record and playback lectures from a distributed online class titled CSCW Using CSCW <ref> [18] </ref> offered on our campus during Fall 1998. Our initial experience from using this system has been extremely positive. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of our system. The client user interface is presented in Section 3. <p> Figure 1 shows a session using vic, vat and mb. These tools have been in widespread use for several years for distributed meetings and seminars, 2 and 3 person collaborations, and distributed classes. During the Fall of 1997, James Landay led a class entitled CSCW Using CSCW <ref> [18] </ref>. Each class meeting was multicast, and between 5-8 students attended each class remotely, using vic, vat, and mb. The class was conducted in a room with several controllable cameras, allowing remote participants to have several views 2 of the in-room speaker and participants.

Reference-contexts: When a component reaches the end of its waiting period, it multicasts a reply back to the client. Other server components that have similar pending replies cancel them 1 . By using a distributed, decentralized implementation, we achieve both scalability and fault tolerance. See <ref> [22] </ref> for more details on the server architecture, description of the fault recovery mechanisms, and an outline of the server control protocol. 2.3 Playback Initiation and Control Clients retrieve the server address and a unique presentation ID through a shared database. <p> Sessions archived on a colibrary server are identified using a URL-like syntax, for example, ssac://224.2.215.35/archive/cscw14/ refers to a session located on the server with the multicast address 224.2.215.35, and controlled via the soft-state archive control (SSAC) protocol <ref> [22] </ref>. The SSAC protocol has been designed for the colibrary architecture. It provides mechanisms for fault discovery and recovery, ensuring a highly available archive service. In addition, because the protocol is multicast, and uses soft state techniques, it is amenable to multiple client control.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, scene changes can be detected without doing any video analysis. This information can be indexed as significant information. User cues. Our collaboration tools are enhanced with special feedback channels for users to deliver visual cues to a speaker <ref> [26] </ref>. Visual cues have the advantage that a user can transmit simple signals without interrupting the speaker by acquiring the audio channel. User cues are transmitted on the conference bus and serve as index points.
