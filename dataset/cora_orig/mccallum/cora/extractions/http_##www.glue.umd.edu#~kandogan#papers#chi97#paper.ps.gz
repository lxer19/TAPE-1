Abstract: Most windowing systems follow the independent overlapping windows approach, which emerged as an answer to the needs of the 1980s' technology. Due to advances in computers and display technology, and increased information needs, modern users demand more functionality from window management systems. We proposed Elastic Windows with improved spatial layout and rapid multi-window operations as an alternative to current window management strategies for efficient personal role management [12]. In this approach, multi-window operations are achieved by issuing operations on window groups hierarchically organized in a space-filling tiled layout. This paper describes the Elastic Windows interface briefly and then presents a study comparing user performance with Elastic Windows and traditional window management techniques for 2, 6, and 12 window situations. Elastic Windows users had statistically significantly faster performance for all 6 and 12 window situations, for task environment setup, task environment switching, and task execution. For some tasks there was a ten-fold speed-up in performance. These results suggest promising possibilities for multiple window operations and hierarchical nesting, which can be applied to the next generation of tiled as well as overlapped window managers.

Reference-contexts: Gaylin [9] observed that the number of window operations to switch the active window set constitutes 63% of all the operations in an independent overlapped window manager. This result supports the findings by Bannon et al. <ref> [1] </ref> that people switch among tasks frequently, forcing them to change the visible set of windows on the screen. According to Gaylin's observations, create and delete window operations accounted for about 15%, whereas move and resize for 6%, with twice as many moves as resizes.

Reference-contexts: However, in a detailed analysis, the actual times spent on task execution were found to be shorter, and the error rates were significantly lower in windowed systems. Bly and Rosenberg <ref> [3] </ref> compared user performance of tiled and overlapping window strategies for regular and irregular tasks, where regularity is determined by the organization of information in a window. Their results supported tiled windows for regular tasks.

Reference-contexts: IGD is a hypertext system which supports the creation of large graphical documents with an arbitrary directed graph structure, with graphical information hiding and structure manipulation capabilities [8]. The Dy-lan programming environment uses a pane-based window system <ref> [7] </ref>, which allows both horizontal and vertical panes, with a mechanism to create links between panes. Lansdale [13] argues that people employ a number of different strategies to access information during their daily practices, and it would be beneficial to support those strategies in computer environments.

Reference-contexts: Besides, layouts can be saved under different names giving users flexibility in using alternative layouts for different subtasks within the same context. Current window management strategies have a limited notion of workspace. Most of the systems provide only one screen, whereas more novel systems, following the Rooms approach <ref> [11] </ref>, provide multiple virtual screen spaces where windows can be placed in any of these spaces. Rooms also provides an overview where users can look at thumbnail images of the screen layouts and use the overview to switch to these screens. <p> In the Independent Overlapping Windows, however, the switching time increased as task environment complexity increased. This was mainly due to the one window at a time approach. Providing an overview and a set of workspaces, as in Rooms <ref> [11] </ref>, would certainly make task switching time independent of the number of windows involved, but Rooms offers only two levels. <p> This observation was confirmed by most of the subjects. Some subjects, however, had no problems visualizing the hierarchy. One subject said that he liked the overview of hierarchical roles as a guide to his daily tasks. RELATED WORK The Rooms system <ref> [11] </ref> uses multiple virtual workspaces, where the overlapping window strategy is used in each of these single-screen workspaces. Each task is devoted to a workspace, where users can switch to other tasks using either the overview or the doors between workspaces for rapid transitions.

Multiple Window Operations Typically, people organize papers on their desk as piles, and move all of them simultaneously. Malone <ref> [14] </ref> found that users like to group items spatially.
