Abstract: An algorithm is presented for partitioning a design in time. The algorithm divides a large, technology-mapped design into multiple configurations of a time-multiplexed FPGA. These configurations are rapidly executed in the FPGA to emulate the large design. The tool includes facilities for optimizing the partitioning to improve routabil-ity, for fitting the design into more configurations than the depth of the critical path and for compressing the critical path of the design into fewer configurations, both to fit the design into the device and to improve performance. Scheduling results are shown for mapping designs into an 8-configuration time-multiplexed FPGA and for architecture investigation for a time-multiplexed FPGA.
