Abstract: In this paper, we describe a tool for the visualization of process protocols produced by the parsing and semantic interpretation modules in a complex machine translation system. These protocols tend to reach considerable sizes, and error tracking in them is tedious and time-consuming. We show how the data in the protocols can be made more easily accessible by extracting a procedural trace, by splitting the protocols into a collection of cross-linked hypertext files, by indexing the files, and by using simple text formatting and sorting of structural elements.
