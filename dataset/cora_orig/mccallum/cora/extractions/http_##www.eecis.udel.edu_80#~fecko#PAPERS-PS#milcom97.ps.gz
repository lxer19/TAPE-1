Abstract: This paper describes the Estelle specification of MIL-STD 188-220A Intranet Layer as well as a methodology for generating test sequences for checking the conformance of a protocol implementation to its specification. The methodology for deriving test cases from an Estelle specification, which serves as input to test generation techniques, is presented. A Chinese postman tour is used to determine a minimum-cost tour of the transition graph for various transition types. Finally, the paper discusses several controllability and optimization issues that need to be addressed in test cases generation for the intranet and datalink layers of MIL-STD 188-220A.

Reference-contexts: Outputs are generated by applying a set of externally controllable inputs. A black-box model for a protocol is represented as a pure finite-state machine (Pure FSM) <ref> [1] </ref> [6] [4]. 4.2 Transition types and testing order For testing purposes, transitions in EFSM are divided into three groups: * valid transitions: defined for the "normal" (or ex pected) behavior of the tested entity; * inopportune transitions: inputs are semantically and syntactically correct, but arrive unexpectedly (or out of sequence) <p> Transitions that involve heavy computations and take longer to realize are assigned higher cost. Examples of costly transitions may be a timer's timeout and a reset transition. The test method that we then use is a Chinese Postman Tour that includes all valid transitions <ref> [1] </ref> [6]. The method was developed at AT&T Bell Labs and applied successfully to testing various other communications protocols including ISDN switches, PBXs and terminals. The method produces a minimum-cost transition tour that starts and ends in the initial state, and that includes each valid transition at least once. <p> Therefore, in the first step of the Chinese Postman Tour method, certain transitions are duplicated to make the graph symmetric at a minimum cost (such transitions are included in a tour more than once) <ref> [1] </ref> [6]. The tour length for our TU module is 815 transitions without state verification, and is estimated at 2; 000 with state verification. 4.5 Phase 3 Inopportune transition testing All inopportune transitions are assumed to be self loops (i.e., start and end state are the same).

Reference-contexts: To ensure that the 188-220A standard is free from ambiguities which might cause implementation problems, we used Estelle to create an unambiguous specification of the Data Link Layer as specified in the 27Jul95 version of the standard <ref> [2] </ref>. This specification effort was divided into three subprojects specifying: Type 1: Connectionless (CL) Operation (unack'ed and coupled ack'ed); Type 2 Connection-mode Operation, and Type 1 4: Decoupled Ack'ed Connectionless Operation. <p> For the more detailed description of the semantics of Es-telle specification components (communication channels, interactions, etc), the interested reader may consult our paper on Datalink Layer specification <ref> [2] </ref>, or visit our www site at http : ==www:cis:udel:edu= ~ amer=CECOM . We instead present a brief overview of Network Layer architecture with a focus on the Topology Update function of the Intranet layer. <p> An example of controllability problems may be a valid transition with the following input/event field in the Type 1 Service Datalink module transition table [8] <ref> [2] </ref>: receive: DL-Unitdata.Req and (intranet message type is IP packet) and (coupled ack required) and (multidestination packet) To test this transition, the tester must be able to perform the following steps: * generate required input the DL Unitdata Req from the intranet layer; * specify message type - IP packet; *

Reference-contexts: In 1989, Estelle was approved as one of two ISO International Standard Formal Description Techniques (FDT) for the specification of computer communication protocols <ref> [3] </ref> [10]. Based on communicating extended finite state machines, Estelle has a formal, mathematical, implementation-independent semantics. It is an expressive, well-defined, well-structured language that is capable of specifying distributed, concurrent information processing systems in a complete, consistent, concise and unambiguous manner.
