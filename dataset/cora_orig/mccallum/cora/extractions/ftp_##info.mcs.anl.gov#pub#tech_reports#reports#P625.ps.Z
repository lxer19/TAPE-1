Abstract: Summary. We present a new technique for the numerical integration over R, a square or triangle, of an integrand of the form (ru) T B(rv). This uses only function values of u, B, and v, avoiding explicit differentiation, but is suitable only when the integrand function is regular over R. The technique is analogous to Romberg integration, since it is based on using a sequence of very simple discretiza-tions J (m) ; m = 1; 2; 3; :::; of the required integral and applying extrapolation in m to provide closer approximations. A general approach to the problem of constructing discretizations is given. We provide specific cost-effective discretizations satisfying familiar, but somewhat arbitrary guidelines. As in Romberg integration, when each component function in the integrand is a polynomial, this technique leads to an exact result.

We follow the notation of the excellent description of Romberg integration given in the fundamental paper of Bauer, Rutishauser, and Stiefel <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> In our case, because (5.1) is such a simple expansion, an aesthetically satisfying alternative is to employ the Neville algorithm T k;p = k+p T k;p1 m 2 m 2 k This is discussed in many places, including <ref> [1] </ref>. The entries in Tables 6.1-6.4 below are elements of the Romberg table, obtained by using J (m i ) = T i;0 , and the geometric mesh sequence (5.2). The Romberg table is convenient because it provides a selection of approximations to E 0 .

Reference-contexts: The article thus presents a generalization of a prototype result of Rude <ref> [10] </ref>. In this present article, however, both the underlying ideas and the detailed development provide the basis for the evaluation of similar integrals whose integrands may involve any specified mixture of functions and derivative functions of any order. In the rest of this section, we discuss some preliminaries. <p> We can provide such a discretization. Discretization 7. (A symmetric) When B (and, by extension, A) is symmetric, one may proceed by setting (see also Lemma 2.1 in Rude <ref> [10] </ref>) (ru) T B (rv) = i;j=1 @n i @v = a 11 (x) + jl 2 j @n 1 @n 1 jl 2 j a 12 (x) @u @v (4.10) jl 2 j jl 1 j @n 3 @n 3 and constructing an overall discretization J (m) as the sum <p> Each of the three discretizations used to compose Discretization 7 satisfies guidelines (G1)-(G3) separately. With trivial exceptions, the same m (m + 1)=2 function values are used in each discretization. All function evaluations are located on the vertex grid. It is pertinent to note that Rude <ref> [10] </ref> has already published a discretization corresponding to Discretization 4. This is as follows. Discretization 8.
