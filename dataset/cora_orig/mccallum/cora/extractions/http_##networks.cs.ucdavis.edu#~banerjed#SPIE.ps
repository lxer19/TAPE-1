Abstract: We develop algorithms for the design of optical packet-switched networks. These algorithms are aimed at upgrading an existing fiber-based, network infrastructure, such as the NSFNET backbone, by using Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology. The network architecture employs wavelength-routing optical switches which enable the establishment of all-optical, WDM channels, called lightpaths. A set of lightpaths may be used as a virtual topology over which packet-switched traffic may be transported in a store-and-forward manner. The packet forwarding is done by electronic packet routers which are attached to the wavelength-routing optical switches. This paper examines issues related to the upgrading of an existing fiber-based, packet-switched, electronic network to accommodate WDM, and to the optimal choice of the virtual topology based on changing traffic demands. We demonstrate how the total information carrying capacity of the network can be enhanced by using WDM.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is a technique used to divide the tremendous bandwidth of a single strand of fiber (potentially a few tens of terabits per second) into many non-overlapping wavelengths (WDM channels) <ref> [1] </ref>. Each of these channels can be operated asynchronously and in parallel at whatever speed one desires, e.g., peak electronic speed of a few gigabits per second. The key technologies that enable WDM optical networks are wavelength-tunable lasers, wavelength-tunable filters, and wide-band fiber amplifiers.

Reference-contexts: WDM has been used in the design of optical wide-area networks (WANs) targeted to nationwide coverage <ref> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>. The designs employ tunable lasers and filters at the access nodes and optical/electronic switches at the routing nodes. <p> This is called the wavelength-continuity constraint in a wavelength-routed network. An all-optical channel (called a lightpath <ref> [2] </ref>) in a WDM WAN may be used to carry either circuit-switched traffic, or packet-switched data, or a hybrid of both.

Reference-contexts: WDM has been used in the design of optical wide-area networks (WANs) targeted to nationwide coverage <ref> [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] </ref>. The designs employ tunable lasers and filters at the access nodes and optical/electronic switches at the routing nodes. <p> subproblems, which are not necessarily independent: 1. determine a good virtual topology, viz. which nodal transmitter should be directly connected to which nodal receiver, 2. route the lightpaths over the physical topology, 3. assign wavelengths optimally to the various lightpaths (this problem has been shown to be NP hard in <ref> [3] </ref>), and 4. route packet traffic on the virtual topology (as in any packet-switched network). This design problem has to deal with constraints on available resources, viz. number of transmitters, receivers, and wavelengths. Subproblem 1 addresses how to properly utilize the limited number of available transmitters and receivers. <p> A number of algorithms have been proposed in the literature for the optimal choice of lightpaths constituting the virtual topology <ref> [3, 4, 6] </ref>. Techniques based on approaches such as simulated annealing, maximizing single-hop traffic, minimizing maximum flow in a link, etc., have been proposed in the literature.

The optimization problem is NP-hard 2 , since several sub-problems of this problem are NP-hard. <p> A number of algorithms have been proposed in the literature for the optimal choice of lightpaths constituting the virtual topology <ref> [3, 4, 6] </ref>. Techniques based on approaches such as simulated annealing, maximizing single-hop traffic, minimizing maximum flow in a link, etc., have been proposed in the literature. <p> The traffic matrix employed for this mapping was an actual measurement of the traffic on the T1 NSFNET backbone for a 15-minute period (11:45 to midnight on January 12, 1992) and is reported in <ref> [4] </ref>. Each node is assumed to be equipped with an equal number of transmitters and receivers. Lightpaths are assumed to be bidirectional, i.e., if there is a lightpath from node A to node B, then there is also a lightpath from node B to node A.

However, these "greedy" techniques may have their own limitations, such as neglecting forwarded traffic, when applied to a wide-area switched optical network. <p> The rationale behind using the physical topology as part of the virtual topology is also to be able to satisfy the packets which need to be delivered with the tightest delay constraints <ref> [6] </ref>. The remaining lightpaths would be added in such a way so as to minimize the average hop distance in the network.

Reference-contexts: The optical-connectivity pattern thus established by the algorithms is (a) transparent to the data being transported, and (d) may be rearrangeable to meet changing traffic and service requirements. Optical-routing switches may be built from 2x2 optical crosspoint elements <ref> [7] </ref>. An optical switch 2 of this type, called a Wavelength Routing Switch (WRS) (see Fig. 2) is composed of wavelength demultiplexers, wavelength multiplexers, and space-division switches.
