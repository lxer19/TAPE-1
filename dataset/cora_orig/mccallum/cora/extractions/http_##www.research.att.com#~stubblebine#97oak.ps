Title: Toward Acceptable Metrics of Authentication

Abstract: Authentication using a path of trusted intermediaries, each able to authenticate the next in the path, is a well-known technique for authenticating entities in a large-scale system. Recent work has extended this technique to include multiple paths in an effort to bolster authentication, but the success of this approach may be unclear in the face of intersecting paths, ambiguities in the meaning of certificates, and interdependencies in the use of different keys. Several authors have thus proposed metrics to evaluate the confidence afforded by a set of paths. In this paper we develop a set of guiding principles for the design of such metrics. We motivate our principles by showing how previous approaches fail with respect to them and what the consequences to authentication might be. We then propose a direction for constructing metrics that come closer to meeting our principles and thus, we believe, to being satisfactory metrics for authentication.

Reference-contexts: For clarity it is also worthwhile to comment on what we are not trying to do in this paper. First, the reader should not confuse our work with recent efforts to capture principles for the design of cryptographic protocols <ref> [3, 1, 18] </ref>. The present work has little to do with protocols; we care about how to evaluate the confidence that authentication paths afford, and not the protocols by which certificates (or any other structures) are communicated. <p> The second type of edge is a "recommendation edge"; the recommendation edge A ; B represents that A trusts B to authenticate other entities or to recommend other entities to authenticate or further recommend. Associated with each recommendation and direct edge is a value in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. In the case of a direct edge A ! B, this value is A's estima 2 tion of the probability that A really holds the correct public key for B. <p> The authors present a formal model to justify these values [4]. Given a specific query, say user A wanting the public key for entity B, the metric computes a value in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, using all paths from A to B whose last edge is direct and whose other edges are recommendation edges, such as A ; C ; D ! B. The exact rules used and an example of such a computation are given in Section 3.2. <p> Similarly, a recommendation edge A ; B denotes that the user is in possession of a recommendation (for recommending or authenticating other entities) for B allegedly signed by entity A. Associated with each recommendation and direct edge is a value in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, called a confidence parameter, that is assigned by the entity that created (the construct represented by) the edge. Given a specific query, e.g., user A wanting the public key for B, the metric computes a confidence value in the range [0; 1] for the key that the model suggests <p> direct edge is a value in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, called a confidence parameter, that is assigned by the entity that created (the construct represented by) the edge. Given a specific query, e.g., user A wanting the public key for B, the metric computes a confidence value in the range [0; 1] for the key that the model suggests is B's, using the confidence parameters specified for the edges as probabilities. Reiter-Stubblebine The Reiter-Stubblebine metric takes a directed graph as input, but again this graph differs from those for the Beth-Borcherding-Klein and Maurer metrics. <p> To show this, it is necessary to review the specific rules used to compute the Beth-Borcherding-Klein metric. Recall from Section 2 that each edge in the Beth-Borcherding-Klein model is labeled with a value in the range <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Suppose that A wants to authenticate (determine the public key for) B.

Reference-contexts: When combined with ambiguities in the assertions that authorities make and ambiguities regarding who is actually making the assertions, it may be difficult to complete the authentication with any confidence. Several researchers have therefore proposed met-rics for measuring the assurance provided by a collection of paths (e.g., <ref> [20, 4, 15, 14, 16] </ref>). For example, a metric might take as input several such paths of authorities and return a numeric value, where a higher value indicates greater confidence in the name-to-public-key binding (for the target name or public key) that those paths support. <p> We put forth our design principles in Section 3. Based on these principles, we then explore a new direction for constructing metrics in Section 4. We conclude in Section 5. 2 Overview of proposed metrics The metrics that we use for illustration are due to Beth, Borcherding, and Klein <ref> [4] </ref>, Zimmermann [24, 17], Maurer [14], and Reiter and Stubblebine [16]. The Zimmermann and Reiter-Stubblebine procedures were not presented as metrics per se in their publications, but we take the liberty of interpreting them as metrics for our purposes. <p> The value on a recommendation edge A ; B represents the degree of A's trust in B as a recommender, where higher values indicate stronger trust. The authors present a formal model to justify these values <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> v i;n i , then the com bined direct trust value is v com (A; B) = 1 i=1 v u n i Y (1 v i;j ) To see an example of applying these rules, consider the graph of Figure 1 (a), which is based on an example from <ref> [4] </ref>. By rules 1 and 2 above, paths A ; C ; F ! B, A ; D ; G ! B, and A ; E ; G ! B yield direct trust values of :204, :173, and :765, respectively. <p> Much of [16] is devoted to finding ways to approximate the metrics it proposes, since one of the Reiter-Stubblebine metrics is NP-hard and the other is coNP-hard. The given procedures for evaluating the Beth-Borcherding-Klein and Maurer metrics are exponential in the size of the model in the worst case <ref> [4, 14] </ref>, though Maurer also discusses directions to approximate his metric. The only metric of the four for which it is known how to compute the metric efficiently in all cases is Zimmermann's. <p> Principle 8 simply says that the metric's output should have some relevance even when computed on this partial information. One metric that does not obey this principle is Beth-Borcherding-Klein. It is easy to verify (and it is noted in <ref> [4] </ref>) that additional edges added to its model can increase or decrease the metric output by an arbitrary amount. Therefore, the metric's output on partial information may give the user little insight into the "actual" quality of the name-to-key binding. <p> An interesting refinement of Principle 8 is to express it precisely in terms of monotonicity, e.g., that adding more certificates to a metric's input should never decrease the level of assurance indicated by the metric's output (cf., <ref> [4, 14] </ref>). To be complete, such a definition must carefully treat certificate revocations and certificates that indicate conflicting information.

Reference-contexts: ways of choosing liable edges that intersect every path from the trusted source key to the target key, what is the minimum amount of money that the user can expect to recover? This amount can be captured precisely using a well-known tool from graph theory called a minimum capacity cut <ref> [6] </ref>. Let K s denote the trusted source key, K t denote the target key, and for each edge K ! K 0 , let the capacity of the edge, denoted c (K; K 0 ), be the insured amount of the edge. <p> However, as we have already described, this decision can be left to the user, by allowing the user to designate her trust in nodes to pay using standard business reports.

Based on our evaluation of several metrics, we believe that the design criteria for these metrics are not widely agreed upon. Indeed, most metrics|including our own|seem to have been put forth with attention to a few specific goals, at the expense of other, arguably important, properties. <p> We conclude in Section 5. 2 Overview of proposed metrics The metrics that we use for illustration are due to Beth, Borcherding, and Klein [4], Zimmermann [24, 17], Maurer [14], and Reiter and Stubblebine <ref> [16] </ref>. The Zimmermann and Reiter-Stubblebine procedures were not presented as metrics per se in their publications, but we take the liberty of interpreting them as metrics for our purposes. <p> There are no other values associated with edges or nodes. Reiter and Stubblebine developed two related met rics in <ref> [16] </ref>. Each metric takes as input the above graph, a key that the user wishes to authenticate (the target key), a key that the user trusts (the source key, e.g., her own), and a bound b on the length of paths to consider. <p> Principle 7: A metric should be able to be computed efficiently.
