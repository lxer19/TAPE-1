Reference-contexts: McCreight <ref> [1] </ref> observes that priority search trees can be used in combination with plane-sweep techniques, to implement best-/first-fit storage allocation, and to determine intersection or containment in a set of linear intervals. Another important observation is that dynamic priority search trees can be implemented by the programmer relatively easily. <p> Another important observation is that dynamic priority search trees can be implemented by the programmer relatively easily. It is particularly worth noting that McCreight <ref> [1] </ref> presents full source code along with his discussion of the priority search tree algorithm.
