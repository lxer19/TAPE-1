Abstract: A box constrained variational inequality problem can be reformulated as an unconstrained minimization problem through the D-gap function. A hybrid Newton-type method is proposed for minimizing the D-gap function. Under suitable conditions, the algorithm is shown to be globally convergent and locally quadratically convergent. Some numerical results are also presented.

Reference-contexts: If the matrix rF (x fl ) is a P -matrix, then x fl is a regular solution. Proof The theorem follows from Lemma 2.2. Alternatively, the statement can be directly derived from a characterization of strong regularity given in <ref> [6, Theorem 3.4] </ref>. 2 To study the convergence rate of the algorithm, we need the following results concerning an error bound property of the D-gap function. <p> As a solver for the linearized variational inequality problems, we used the semismooth Newton-type method from <ref> [6] </ref>. In contrast to what is said in the description of our algorithm, however, we always accept the corresponding search direction d k whenever it satisfies the descent test rg fffi (x k ) T d k &lt; 0; note that this guarantees that the Armijo line search is well-defined. <p> A sufficient condition is given for a solution x fl of the VIP to be regular. This condition is only concerned with the mapping F , unlike the conditions in <ref> [24, 17, 6] </ref>. 13 Table 1: Numerical results for MCPLIB test problems problem n m SP P-steps N-steps G-steps F -eval. g fffi (x f ) kr (x f )k bertsekas 15 15 1 0 4 0 11 7.5e-15 2.7e-7 bertsekas 15 15 2 1 4 0 12 7.5e-15 2.7e-7 bertsekas

Reference-contexts: As a remedy for this inconvenience, Sun, Fukushima and Qi [25] introduced the concept of a computable generalized Hessian of the D-gap function g fffi and presented a Newton-type method for solving problem (5). Restricting themselves to the box constrained VIP, Kanzow and Fukushima <ref> [15] </ref> discussed a generalized Hessian of the D-gap function and proposed a Gauss-Newton-type method to minimize it.

This work is motivated by the recent paper [22] in which the D-gap function is used to globalize the classical Josephy-Newton method [14] for general VIPs. <p> Let * = 0 and suppose that the algorithm generates an infinite sequence fx k g. Then any accumulation point x fl of the sequence fx k g is a stationary point of the D-gap function g fffi . If F is a uniform P -function, then by <ref> [15, Theorem 4.1] </ref>, the level sets of D-gap function g fffi are bounded. Since fg fffi (x k )g is nonincreasing, the boundedness of level sets guarantees the boundedness of the generated sequence fx k g and hence the existence of at least one accumulation point of fx k g. <p> Since fg fffi (x k )g is nonincreasing, the boundedness of level sets guarantees the boundedness of the generated sequence fx k g and hence the existence of at least one accumulation point of fx k g. On the other hand, by <ref> [15, Theorem 3.1] </ref>, any stationary point ~x of g fffi such that rF (~x) is a P -matrix is a solution of the VIP (1). <p> Moreover y fi (x) and R fi (x) are defined similarly. Let B () denote the closed sphere centered at x fl with radius &gt; 0, i.e., B () := fx 2 &lt; n j kx x fl k g: Following the proof of Lemma 5.1 in <ref> [15] </ref>, we have the next lemma. Lemma 3.4 Let x fl be a solution of the VIP (1) with X being a box. Suppose that F is a uniform P -function with modulus . <p> Proof By Theorem 3.1, x fl is a stationary point of the D-gap function g fffi . Since rF (x fl ) is a P -matrix by Lemma 2.1, it follows from Theorem 3.1 in <ref> [15] </ref> that x fl is already a solution of the VIP (1). Moreover Lemma 3.3 shows that x fl is a regular solution. Since F is differentiable, it is locally Lipschitzian; hence there exists a 1 &gt; 0 such that F is is Lipschitz continuous on B ( 1 ).

Unfortunately, it does not seem to be very robust unless relatively strong assumptions are satisfied. So we first apply the nonsmooth Newton-type method from [16] in order to solve a test example, but we stop this preprocessing iteration if either the termination criterion (34) is satisfied or if a certain test indicates that the preprocessor runs into difficulties. <p> In the latter case, we switch to the hybrid Newton method introduced in this paper which is not as efficient as the method from <ref> [16] </ref>, but which seems to be considerably more reliable. <p> The actual parameters used in (35) are t min = 10 4 and c = 10 2 : If the preprocessor is successful and converges to a solution of the box constrained variational inequality problem which satisfies the standard regularity conditions used in <ref> [16] </ref> for the local convergence theory, then t k = 1 for all k sufficiently large and g fffi (x k ) = O (krg fffi (x k )k 2 ), so none of the tests in (35) will be satisfied. <p> In fact, we made the following observation during the testing phase for our algorithm: Both the preprocessor from <ref> [16] </ref> and the hybrid Newton-type method discussed in this paper try to minimize the D-gap function g fffi . Now, the D-gap function might have a local minimum which does not correspond to a solution of the box constrained variational inequality problem. <p> In fact, this difficulty arises, e.g., for the billups example. In general, however, our observation is that the method from <ref> [16] </ref> tends to converge to a local minimum of g fffi much more often than the method discussed here. <p> This seems to indicate that, from a global point of view, the search direction computed by our hybrid Newton-type method is a much better search direction than the one computed by the nonsmooth Newton-type method in <ref> [16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Now we turn our attention to the convergence rate of the algorithm. A solution x fl of the VIP (1) is said to be regular in the sense of Robinson <ref> [24] </ref> (see also [13]) if there exist a neighborhood of x fl and a neighborhood V of 0 2 &lt; n such that, for every v 2 V , the perturbed VIP of finding a vector x 2 X such that h ~ F (x; v); y xi 0; 8 y <p> A sufficient condition is given for a solution x fl of the VIP to be regular. This condition is only concerned with the mapping F , unlike the conditions in <ref> [24, 17, 6] </ref>. 13 Table 1: Numerical results for MCPLIB test problems problem n m SP P-steps N-steps G-steps F -eval. g fffi (x f ) kr (x f )k bertsekas 15 15 1 0 4 0 11 7.5e-15 2.7e-7 bertsekas 15 15 2 1 4 0 12 7.5e-15 2.7e-7 bertsekas

Reference-contexts: However, it is not twice differentiable in general. Therefore it is not straightforward to apply conventional second-order methods to problem (5). As a remedy for this inconvenience, Sun, Fukushima and Qi <ref> [25] </ref> introduced the concept of a computable generalized Hessian of the D-gap function g fffi and presented a Newton-type method for solving problem (5). <p> Restricting themselves to the box constrained VIP, Kanzow and Fukushima [15] discussed a generalized Hessian of the D-gap function and proposed a Gauss-Newton-type method to minimize it. Further properties of the D-gap function have been investigated in <ref> [15, 25, 11] </ref>. This work is motivated by the recent paper [22] in which the D-gap function is used to globalize the classical Josephy-Newton method [14] for general VIPs.

Reference-contexts: The following lemma is a refinement of Proposition 2.2 in <ref> [26] </ref>. Lemma 2.4 Suppose that F is a continuously differentiable uniform P -function and X is a box. Then the solution z (x) of the affine VIP (17) is continuous as a function of x.
