Abstract: This paper describes an imprecise computation model for continuous and time-invariant systems in the presence of corrupted information. The conditions under which the difference between the corrupted state and the precise state, called the tracking error, converges to zero or is less than * (* &gt; 0) are determined.

Reference-contexts: When hardware failures and dynamic demands cause the underlying computing system to be overloaded, a control-law computation may complete late. If a control-law computation is allowed to be imprecise <ref> [1] </ref>, it may be only partially completed or skipped entirely. We say that a corruption occurs and the control system is corrupted when any of these events occurs. <p> We focus here on the case where the control-law computation is an imprecise computation. The imprecise computation technique was recently proposed in <ref> [1] </ref> as a means to handle transient overload in real-time communication networks and computing systems. In a system that supports imprecise computation, each fl This research is supported in part by ONR Contract No. N00014-92-J-1146. task is divided into two subtasks the mandatory subtask and the optional subtask.

The locomotion system is a highly nonlinear system. It consists of two rigid bodies (body and leg) connected by a frictionless hinge at the gravity center. Their motion is constrained to the vertical plane (x y). <p> This set of parameters is taken from <ref> [6] </ref>. <p> We found that the actual tracking error is less than 10 5:5 , which is much better than our chosen acceptable error of 10 2 . For the choice (2) of feedback gain by <ref> [6] </ref>, the robust coefficient is 1:9612 fl 10 8 . The right-hand side of (3) is 2:2348 fl 10 11 : The tracking error is less than 10 11 in this case.
