Abstract: This paper describes queue monitoring, a policy for managing the effect of delay jitter on audio and video in computer-based conferences. By observing delay jitter over time, this policy dynamically adjusts display latency in order to support low-latency conferences with an acceptable gap rate. Queue monitoring is evaluated by comparing it with two other policies in an empirical study of a computer-based conferencing system. Our results show that queue monitoring performs well under a variety of observed network loads. Our research is concerned with network and operating system support for computer-based conferencing using today's networks based on asynchronous communications (e.g., ethernet, token ring, FDDI, T3, etc.). In this environment, transmission times vary, and hence audio and video data may occasionally arrive at their destination late. When data arrives after the time at which it should be displayed, a gap appears in the display which affects the user's perception of the conference. Our goal is to provide solutions to this problem for small internetworks consisting of several physical networks connected via bridges and routers (e.g., a building-area or campus-area network). Support for such networks will be necessary if, as we believe, conventional LANs continue to be widely used in the last mile to the desktop. For the audio and video hardware considered in our work, frames are acquired from an audio or video source at a precise rate (e.g., one frame every 33 ms. for video). Frames must then be delivered to the display at the same precise rate. Prior to delivery, each frame must be digitized, compressed, transmitted over the network, and decompressed. Once decompressed, a frame may then be buffered for some time waiting to be delivered to the display. The display latency of a frame is defined as the total time from acquisition to display. The end-to-end delay of a frame is defined as the total time from acquisition to decompression (i.e., the latency of the frame minus any time spent in buffers waiting to be displayed). If we assume that the time required to digitize, compress, or decompress frames is not constant, or if we assume that the delays incurred

Reference-contexts: This is the approach used in computer-based conferencing systems based on networks that provide isochronous services (such as ATM). Another approach minimizes delay jitter by using resource reservation to provide guaranteed bounds on delay and delay jitter. For example, Ferrari <ref> [1] </ref> presents a scheme in which clients requiring real-time communication services specify their traffic characteristics and performance requirements. In response, the system reserves enough resources at each node on the network (e.g., processor capacity, buffer space) to guarantee the performance requirements of the client.

Reference-contexts: In particular, we describe a policy called queue monitoring which is designed to perform well over a range of network conditions and has an efficient implementation. We present an empirical study in which traces from a computer-based conferencing system (described in <ref> [2] </ref>) are used to simulate and compare queue monitoring and two policies from the literature: the I-policy and the E-policy.

Reference-contexts: Naylor and Kleinrock <ref> [4] </ref> proposed that a display latency be chosen at the beginning of each talkspurt by observing the transmission delays of the last m audio fragments, discarding the k largest delays, and choosing the greatest remaining delay.

Reference-contexts: For their particular model of audio quality, they stated a rule of thumb for choosing m and k (m &gt; 40 and k = .07*m) which usually resulted in good quality audio. More recent work on practical solutions for the Internet (as exemplified by Nevot <ref> [5] </ref>), has also used a scheme by which a display latency is chosen at the beginning of each talkspurt on the basis of observed delay jitter.
