Abstract: We study a model nonlinear, degenerate, advection-diffusion equation having application in petroleum reservoir and groundwater aquifer simulation. The main difficulty is that the true solution is typically lacking in regularity; therefore, we consider the problem from the point of view of optimal approximation. Through time integration, we develop a mixed variational form that respects the known minimal regularity, and then we develop and analyze two versions of a mixed finite element approximation, a simpler semidiscrete (time continuous) version and a fully discrete version. Our error bounds are optimal in the sense that all but one of the bounding terms reduce to standard approximation error. The exceptional term is a nonstandard approximation error term. We also consider our new formulation for the nondegenerate problem, showing the usual optimal L 2 -error bounds; moreover, superconvergence is obtained under special circumstances.

Reference-contexts: To obtain below a mixed formulation, we introduce a new variable (1.2) = ffrP (u) fi (P (u)): The main difficulty in approximating (1.1) is that the solution is typically lacking in regularity.

Reference-contexts: We begin by deriving an appropriate mixed variational formulation of (1.1). From (1.3), both u and u t are in L 2 (J ; H 1 ()); we therefore conclude that u 2 C 0 (J ; H 1 ()) (see Chapter 1 of <ref> [19] </ref>). This gives us u (; t) pointwise for every t 2 J, first as a distribution in H 1 (), but actually in L 1 () by (A3).

We can recover actual rates of convergence of the scheme as soon as some regularity is shown for the solution.

Reference-contexts: It appears that we have the first proof of superconvergence for the vector flux variable in the nonlinear problem, though superconvergence had been observed experimentally <ref> [31] </ref>. 2. Two applications. Problem (1.1) appears in many applications; we motivate our work by describing two of them. Petroleum reservoir and groundwater aquifer simulation often requires the solution of a nonlinear, degenerate, advection-diffusion problem describing two-phase flow in porous media [1], [4], [8], [13], [26].
