Title: Oscillation and Sequential Behavior Caused by Opens in the Routing in Digital CMOS Circuits  
Author: Haluk Konuk F. Joel Ferguson 
Abstract: Shorts and opens are the most common types of catastrophic defects in today's CMOS ICs. In this paper we show that an open in the interconnect wiring of a digital CMOS circuit, which permanently disconnects inputs of logic gates from their driver, can cause oscillation or sequential behavior. We present supporting experimental data collected by creating an interconnect open in a manufactured chip. We also show that the conditions for oscillation and sequential behavior are likely to occur in many interconnect opens.

Reference-contexts: are independent of the floating wire voltage, a 0.5 probability for each such signal wire to be logic-1, and a normal distribution for the number of wires at logic-1 among the N signal wires, then the probability P (x) that x wires are at logic-1 is given by the following <ref> [1] </ref>: P (x) = 2 e 2 (xN=2) 2 =N Note that we are actually using the normal distribution formula to approximate the binomial distribution. When N = 10, the probability that 4, 5, or 6 wires are at logic-1 is 0.67. This corresponds to the region N=2 N=10.

Reference-contexts: Breaks in a digital CMOS circuit fall into different categories depending on their location. A break can occur inside a CMOS cell affecting transistor drain and source connections [9, 3, 4, 12], disconnect a single transistor gate from its driver <ref> [2, 15] </ref>, or disconnect a set of logic-gate inputs from their drivers; thus causing these inputs to float. In order for a break to disconnect a set of logic-gate outputs from their drivers, the break must occur in the interconnect wiring.

Reference-contexts: add the assumption that f loat is actually floating, then the following equation must also be satisfied: Q init = Q s + C GND V float + C V DD (V float V DD ) where Q init is the trapped charge on f loat during the fabrication process <ref> [6] </ref> [10].

Reference-contexts: If C wire to wire is not large enough, oscillation will not occur. Since the gate/source and the gate/drain capacitances for the inverter in Figure 3, also referred as the Miller capacitances by Konuk et al. <ref> [8] </ref>, are non-linear, and the voltage at the output of the inverter has a non-linear relationship to its input, we used HSPICE simulation to see the effects of these Miller capacitances.

The voltage around which f loat will oscillate is determined by the values of C V DD , C GND , and the Miller capacitances <ref> [9] </ref> in the inverter driven by f loat, as shown in Figure 3. Given these capacitances, the size of C wire to wire determines the V float =V q ratio. If C wire to wire is not large enough, oscillation will not occur.

Reference-contexts: the assumption that f loat is actually floating, then the following equation must also be satisfied: Q init = Q s + C GND V float + C V DD (V float V DD ) where Q init is the trapped charge on f loat during the fabrication process [6] <ref> [10] </ref>. If we assume that Q init is zero, then we can rewrite the above equation as follows: Q s = C V DD V DD (C V DD + C GND ) V float (1) We discuss the effect of Q init not being zero in Section 6. <p> Our guess for this behavior is that the FIB'ing process somehow created a leakage path from f loat to the ground. We do not expect that the intermetal dielectric 18 can be conductive enough to bleed the charge on f loat this fast, as we explained in <ref> [10] </ref>. We modeled this leakage path with R LEAKAGE in Figure 13. We performed an HPSPICE simulation using R LEAKAGE = 10M, C V DD = 1.93fF, and C GND = 6.00fF, which correpond to our FIB'ed open shown in Figure 15, which is 10 to the left of via1. <p> An interconnect open creates a floating metal wire that might collect electrical charge during the fabrication process [6] [11]. Konuk and Ferguson <ref> [10] </ref> reported that trapped charge on floating metal wires connected to transistor gates can create voltages in the range between -1V to 1V, but 75% of the measurements were between -0.5V and 0.5V for a set of experimental chips fabricated with an HP 0.8 process. <p> The exact value of Q init is very much process and layout dependent. Another interesting factor in determining the voltage of a floating wire is the RC interconnect behavior of the die surface as observed by Konuk and Ferguson <ref> [10] </ref>. In this case, the capacitance from the floating wire to the die surface and the die surface resistivity are the important factors.

One common technique to bleed this charge is the use of charge collector diodes as shown in Figure 18. The reverse-bias current of this diode needs to be sufficient to bleed the charge at the necessary rate during plasma etching.

Reference-contexts: Point b corresponds to a metastable state, because even the slightest disturbance on V float will kick the solution point to either a or c, very much like the metastability in a latch <ref> [13] </ref>. Therefore, point b is not a real solution. 9 10 Points a and c are stable states. <p> Table 3 shows the flow table of the resulting fundamental mode finite state machine where the variables R and S are the logic values of the capacitively coupled line and the input to the OR gate, respectively. The stable states are marked with an asterisk <ref> [13] </ref>. This is the same behavior as an RS latch with the R input inverted. 3.2 Feedback via Miller Capacitance The feedback we described in the preceding subsection was due to a wire-to-wire capacitance from output to input.

Reference-contexts: In today's CMOS ICs with up to five metal layers, interconnect wiring is probably the most likely place for a break to occur. Vias are especially susceptible to breaks, and the number of vias is exceeding the number of transistors in some microprocessor designs <ref> [17] </ref>. We call the fault created by a break in the interconnect wiring an interconnect open. In this paper we show that an interconnect open can create capacitive feedback paths in a CMOS circuit; thus causing oscillation and sequential behavior.
