Abstract: Despite the variety of discussions on induction, there is still no explicit definition of the concept. However, since most treatments appear to, at least implicitly, acknowledge it, it seems clear that such a definition exists. A key obstacle seems to be the confusion between what induction is, and how induction should be performed. This research proposes the idea that induction should be viewed in two distinct, but related, ways. The more general, abstract way gets to the heart of this concept definition, and treats induction purely as an inference. In this inference view, there is no concern for issues of efficiency, effectiveness, and other qualities of how induction might be performed. The second way to view induction is as the process which implements the inference. This paper establishes a definition of induction in the inference view. The subtleties and implications of this definition are discussed, and are also compared with key issues and published opinions of induction.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction and Motivation Induction has been discussed in many ways. To name a few, [Michalski, 1983], <ref> [Dietterich, 1990] </ref>, [Quinlan, 1986], [Russell, 1989], [Rendell, 1986], and [Holland et al., 1986], represent a variety of different views on the subject. <p> Together with Non-Deducibility, it captures the notion that induction introduces new knowledge. In Dietterichs <ref> [Dietterich, 1990] </ref> terms, there is an increase at the knowledge level. <p> Further, unless the training examples included all possible representable examples, then the Non-Deducibility criterion will be satisfied. The NonEmptiness criterion is trivially satisfied. Finally, provided the training data is noise-free, the decision tree (NewK) should be perfectly consistent with the StartK (Obs+). Dietterichs Knowledge Level Learning Discussion Dietterich <ref> [Dietterich, 1990] </ref> describes induction as a subset of NonDeductive Knowledge Level Learning (NKLL). In a system which performs NKLL, there must be an increase at the knowledge level (Non-Emptiness criterion) and this new knowledge should not be deductively derivable from the starting knowledge (Non-Deducibility criterion).

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction and Motivation Induction has been discussed in many ways. To name a few, [Michalski, 1983], [Dietterich, 1990], [Quinlan, 1986], [Russell, 1989], [Rendell, 1986], and <ref> [Holland et al., 1986] </ref>, represent a variety of different views on the subject. <p> Issues of Non-Deducibility and Consistency are not addressed in Rendells discussion. Most of it is focused on an overview of means for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of induction (process view concerns). Holland, Holyoak, Nisbett, & Thagard Holland et al. <ref> [Holland et al., 1986] </ref> take a different approach from most others. For an inference definition, they provide littler more than ...induction, which we take to encompass all inferential processes that expand knowledge in the face of uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that the entailment in Satisfaction is not always restricted to the formal description of first order logic. Many induction problems are not set within the domain of FOL. Further, some paradigms (e.g., [Salmon, 1984] or BACON.4 <ref> [Langley et al., 1987] </ref>) dont even require that the PriorK and NewK strictly entail the observations. The entailment can be weak, meaning that the observations are only partial consequences or are only plausible given the PriorK and NewK.

Reference-contexts: This does not mean, however, that such observations must come from the environment outside an inductive system. Dietterich [Dietterich , 1990] cites AM <ref> [Lenat and Brown, 1984] </ref> as an implemented system which performs induction over its own, internally generated, observations. 2.4 Non-Deducibility: StartK / a NewK Induction should introduce new knowledge. The NewK should not be a deductive conclusion of the starting knowledge. This restriction has a few interesting consequences.

Reference-contexts: It is a very specific fact. This particular type of example, where a general rule which entails the observations is part of the PriorK, is often cited as a case of abductive reasoning ([Fann, The previous footnote (involving satisfaction of the Obs+) is relevant here as well. 9 1970], <ref> [Levesque, 1989] </ref>). This leads to interesting questions (which are not addressed here) regarding the relationship of abduction to induction. For now, conclude simply that while it does not have to be so, a NewK which is a generalization of the Obs+ makes satisfying the induction criteria easier.

Reference-contexts: There should be no contradictions between the two. The usefulness of this restriction in a practical systems relies on a previously mentioned assumption: that the starting knowledge is correct. Induction does not permit the addition of new knowledge which contradicts what is already known. Paradigms such as Non-monotonic Reasoning <ref> [McDermott and Doyle, 1980] </ref> are designed to handle the cases where the PriorK can be withdrawn or modified. Such changes are not permitted in induction.

The inference description is not made explicit on its own.

The belief is that there is a common understanding of induction as an inference, and that it can be found underlying the various discussions of induction 2 .

Where does the knowledge which embodies the process (including such things as bias) belong? It seems that the only Such consistency is all some induction paradigms require with respect to the negative examples. Many Inductive Logic Programming efforts (as summarized in <ref> [Muggleton, 1994] </ref>) have such a condition, for example. 10 reasonable place to assign it is to the PriorK (part of the StartK) However, then the NewK is a logical (deductive) consequence of the StartK (since the entire program is now a part of the StartK).

Negative Examples Often, in descriptions of learning by induction (particularly those in machine learning), part of the StartK is given to negative observations (see, for example, <ref> [Quinlan, 1986] </ref>). Such observations, given in a task where the goal is to derive concept descriptions from examples, are descriptions of examples of objects which are not in the goal concept.

For now, it is enough to see how Dietterichs ideas are reflected in the inference criterion. Rendell Rendell <ref> [Rendell, 1986] </ref> gives an account of induction which centers around the idea of class formation. He ultimately defines the problem of induction as the problem of discovering a utility function, u, the purpose of which is to establish class membership.

As another example, consider <ref> [Russell, 1989] </ref>. While briefly describing an inference characterization of induction, Russell spends much of his time discussing how the New Knowledge will be generated, particularly in a way which will ensure its future validity 1 .

Reference-contexts: Since the inference view ignores any such process however, there is some uncertainty to the NewK with respect to the existing knowledge.

Reference-contexts: This subject is discussed further in Section 5: Goals and Observations. It should be noted that the entailment in Satisfaction is not always restricted to the formal description of first order logic. Many induction problems are not set within the domain of FOL. Further, some paradigms (e.g., <ref> [Salmon, 1984] </ref> or BACON.4 [Langley et al., 1987]) dont even require that the PriorK and NewK strictly entail the observations. The entailment can be weak, meaning that the observations are only partial consequences or are only plausible given the PriorK and NewK. <p> Uncertainty Another claim made of induction is that it introduces uncertainty into the knowledge base, or that the truth of premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusions <ref> [Salmon, 1984] </ref>. In the inference definition of induction, this uncertainty is related to the Non-Deducibility criteria. That is, since the NewK is not derivable from the StartK, the NewKs correctness is unknown. Notice, this does not mean there is no way to determine the NewKs correctness.
