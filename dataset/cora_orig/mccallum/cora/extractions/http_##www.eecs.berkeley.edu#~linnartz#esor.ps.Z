Abstract: In this paper we propose a method to watermark digital video content in such a way that detection in consumer electronics (CE) equipment is possible with very little hardware (a few thousand gates). The method proposes to modify the MPEG encoding procedure to choose the so-called Picture Type of video-frames not from a regular sequence but according to a message one would like to transmit. Removal of this embedded message, the PTY-Mark, from the resulting MPEG-stream without jeopardizing video quality is only possible after a complete MPEG decoding and re-encoding cycle. We investigate the modifications to current MPEG encoders which are necessary to accommodate these PTY-Marks. Based on tests we comment on their feasibility. Detection of watermarks without secrets is very reminiscent of "public-key" cryptography. We discuss this relationship by contrasting PTY-marks with pixel-watermarking.

Reference-contexts: Lacking such systems, typically a secret key algorithm is placed in a tamper-resistant box. It has been shown, however, that even if one assumes that this box is perfectly tamper-proof, it can efficiently be misused as an oracle to reveal the secrets of the watermark <ref> [17] </ref>. To deal with these three problems and fend off the various attacks associated with them, we would need another "mark", as closely intertwined, with the content as the pixel-domain watermark, but one that can already be detected in the drive.

Reference-contexts: For video compression we used a public domain software MPEG-1 encoder compressing at predetermined rates from Berkeley <ref> [20] </ref>. The SNR was measured by decompressing the compressed video; this result was subtracted from the original image and the error was computed in the usual mean-squared sense and was normalized to 100 for the orthodox IBBP BBP -GOP structure.
