Pollack, Department of Computer Science and Intelligent Systems Program, University of Pittsburgh Pittsburgh, PA 15260, pollack@cs.pitt.edu Carlo Rovelli, Department of Physics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, rovelli+@pitt.edu Ioannis Tsamardinos, Intelligent Systems Program, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, tsamard@cs.pitt.edu In building intelligent network agents, computer scientists may employ a variety of different design strategies, and their design decisions can have a significant effect on the ultimate nature of network interactions. Some agent designs are cooperative, and populations of agents based on them would be able to interact smoothly, effectively utilizing network resources. In contrast, other agent designs can lead to ineffective and wasteful competition for network resources, resulting in massive bottlenecks and unacceptable access delays. We focus here on a particular design question, the multiple-access problem: if an agent seeking a piece of information knows of several sites that have, or might have, that information, how many queries should it issue, and when? We provide a formal analysis that demonstrates the viability of cooperative responses to this question under certain assumptions. We then discuss the limitations of this analysis, and present the results of experiments done using a geneticalgorithms approach in which simulated network agents evolve cooperative strategies, under less restrictive assumptions than those made in the formal analysis.

Reference-contexts: Evolving Access Strategies Initially, we conducted exploratory studies aimed at finding optimal strategies for populations of simulated agents to use, given certain kinds of environments (e.g., number of agents, number of sites, average delay, etc.) We were unable to find obvious regularities, and hence decided to adopt a geneticalgorithms approach <ref> (Holland, 1975) </ref>, allowing the optimal strategies to evolve. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are algorithms that control search in a given search space by applying Darwinian ideas of natural selection. A fitness function is defined, and the GAs attempt to find a point in the search space that optimizes the fitness function.
