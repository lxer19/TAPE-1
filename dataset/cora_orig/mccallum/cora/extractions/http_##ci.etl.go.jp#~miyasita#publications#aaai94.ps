Reference-contexts: Case-based knowledge acquisition systems, (e.g. <ref> (Bareiss 1989) </ref>) require causal explanations from an expert teacher to acquire domain knowledge. In our approach neither the user nor the program are assumed to possess causal domain knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Our approach uses case-based reasoning (CBR) which has been successful in dealing with exceptional data (Golding & Rosenbloom 1991; Ruby & Kibler 1992), acquiring user knowledge in complex domains (Chaturvedi 1993; Mckay, Buzacott, & Safayeni 1988), and expending less effort in knowledge acquisition compared with knowledge acquisition for rule-based systems <ref> (Lewis, Minior, & Brown 1991) </ref>. CABINS acquires, stores and reuses two categories of concepts that reflect user preferences (1) what heuristic local optimization action to choose in a particular context, and (2) what combinations of effects of application of a particular local optimization action constitutes an acceptable or unacceptable outcome.

Reference-contexts: The value of incorporating context-dependent user preferences in operational scheduling environments is becoming increasingly recognized (e.g. <ref> (Mckay, Buzacott, & Safayeni 1988) </ref>) but adequate techniques are lacking. CABINS Overview CABINS is composed of three modules: (1) an initial schedule builder, (2) an interactive schedule repair (case acquisition) module and (3) an automated schedule repair (case re-use) module.

Reference-contexts: In order to test the hypothesis that CABINS consistently improves schedule quality independent of the method of initial schedule generation, we generated initial schedules for the benchmark suite of problems using three different state-of-the-art dispatch scheduling heuristics (EDD, WSPT, R&M) <ref> (Morton & Pentico 1993) </ref> and a constraint-based scheduler (CBS). The optimization objective was WT+WIP. Table 1 presents the average of all 60 problems in the benchmark and shows that CABINS improved schedule quality inde-pendent of method to create the initial schedule.

Reference-contexts: The global features re-flect an abstract characterization of potential repair flexibility for the whole schedule. High 'Resource Utilization Average', for example, often indicates a tight schedule without much repair flexibility. Associated with a focal activity are local features that we have identified, based on those reported in <ref> (Ow, Smith, & Thiriez 1988) </ref>, and which potentially are predictive of estimating the effects of applying a particular repair tactic to the schedule. For example, 'Predictive Shift Gain' predicts how much overall gain will be achieved by moving the current focal activity earlier in its time horizon.

Reference-contexts: In many practical problems, such as scheduling and design, optimization criteria often involve context- and user-dependent tradeoffs which are impossible to realistically consolidate in a cost function. Second, expert system approaches, while having the potential to capture context-dependent tradeoffs in rules, require considerable knowledge acquisition effort <ref> (Prerau 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Six groups of 10 problems each were randomly generated by considering three different values of the range parameter, and two values of the bottleneck configuration (1 and 2 bottleneck problems). These problems are variations of the problems originally reported in <ref> (Sadeh 1991) </ref>. Our problem sets are, however, different in two respects: (a) we allow substitutable resources for non-bottleneck resources whereas the original problems did not, and (b) the due dates of jobs in our problems are tighter by 20 percents than in the original problems.
