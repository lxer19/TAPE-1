Title: In: Linear Algebra for Signal Processing,  CONTINUITY OF THE JOINT SPECTRAL RADIUS: APPLICATION TO WAVELETS  
Author: A. Bojanczyk and G. Cybenko, eds., Christopher Heil* and Gilbert Strangy

Abstract: The joint spectral radius is the extension to two or more matrices of the (ordinary) spectral radius (A) = max j i (A)j = lim kA m k 1=m . The extension allows matrix products m taken in all orders, so that norms and eigenvalues are difficult to estimate. We show that the limiting process does yield a continuous function of the original matrices|this is their joint spectral radius. Then we describe the construction of wavelets from a dilation equation with coefficients c k . We connect the continuity of those wavelets to the value of the joint spectral radius of two matrices whose entries are formed from the c k .

Reference-contexts: The right side of (1.2) approaches equality as m ! 1 by the definition of the joint spectral radius. Whether the left side also approaches equality is much less clear.

Reference-contexts: Then all the restricted products ( m )j W must converge to zero as m ! 1. As Berger and Wang [BW1] observed, this is equivalent to ^ &lt; 1 (on W ). We therefore have the following necessary condition for ' to be continuous: Theorem 3.1. <ref> [CH2] </ref>. If ' is a continuous scaling function then ^(T 0 j W ; T 1 j W ) &lt; 1: The subspace W is not as difficult to determine explicitly as it may appear. <p> But the convergence of all products to zero is equivalent to the assumption ^ &lt; 1. So, we have the following sufficient condition for the existence of a continuous scaling function: Theorem 3.2. <ref> [CH2] </ref>. If ^(T 0 j W ; T 1 j W ) &lt; 1 then the dilation equation yields a continuous scaling function '. <p> Thus ^(T 0 j W ; T 1 j W ) 0:66 &lt; 1, so ' and are continuous. The maximum Holder exponent is ff log 2 0:66 0:60. Since ff &lt; 1, ' and are not differentiable. We close by mentioning some connections, observed in <ref> [CH2] </ref>, between Corollary 1.1 and the continuity of the joint spectral radius. By Corollary 1.1, ^(A; B) is a continuous function of the entries of A and B. The entries of T 0 and T 1 consist of the coefficients (c 0 ; : : : ; c N ). <p> Theorem 3.2 is an extension of this result to arbitrary dilation equations, and Theorem 3.1 is its converse.

Reference-contexts: It is frustrating that this fundamental number ^, a function only of the entries in A and B, should be so difficult to compute. The same is true in the more highly developed theory of products of random matrices <ref> [CKN] </ref>. The corresponding number ffi is an expected value instead of a maximum, and the only weakness is its resistance to calculation. In our present problem, Lagarias and Wang [LW] conjecture that equality holds on the left side of (1.2) for some finite m.

Reference-contexts: The solution is the box function ' = [0;1) . Both the minimal accuracy and orthogonality conditions hold, and (x) = '(2x) '(2x 1) generates a wavelet CONTINUITY OF THE JOINT SPECTRAL RADIUS 55 orthonormal basis. This property of was first observed by Haar <ref> [H] </ref>. The accuracy and orthogonality conditions (2.3) and (2.4) ensure that equation (2.1) yields a unique, compactly supported, integrable scaling function '. Without these conditions, existence is not guaranteed. (If a compactly supported scaling function does exist then it is unique.) We only consider compact support in this note. 3.

These corollaries are given explicitly in <ref> [HC] </ref>. When the minimal accuracy condition (2.3) does hold, the matrices T 0 and T 1 are column stochastic in the sense that each column sums to one| although the entries need not be nonnegative.
