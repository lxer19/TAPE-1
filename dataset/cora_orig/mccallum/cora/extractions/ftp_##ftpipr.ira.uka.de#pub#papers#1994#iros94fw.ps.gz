Abstract: The problem of adapting mobile robot navigation to changes in the environment is usually approached by modifying an internal world model. Descriptions on different levels of abstraction provide the information necessary for navigation and therefore influence the robot's behaviour. The effect of such indirect adaptation is limited. The approach presented in this paper describes a new technique for direct integration of navigation experience in path planning. Thus, not only the world knowledge, but also the planning behaviour is improved over time. Experiments are carried out on a robot which is controlled by a layered architecture. It is integrated in a multi-robot control environment which is described. The focus of the article is towards improving the higher navigation levels. The main idea being presented is the realization of adaptive behaviour not only on the level of reflexes, but also with respect to the planning capabilities of the robot. The application of learning techniques allows to continuously improve the estimation of plan costs and therefore the inherent strategy of the topological planner. It is illustrated that a combined learning of world description and navigation allows fast and sophisticated reaction to new environmental conditions.

Reference-contexts: Two approaches are investigated how to modify the robot's behaviour when the environment has changed. The first can be called indirect adaptation. Changes in the environment, such as newly detected obstacles, are perceived via the robot's sensors and integrated in a world model <ref> [1] </ref>. As planning is based on world knowledge, the robot will behave according to the new situation. However, such indirect adaptation offers no possibility to integrate navigation experience made by the robot when driving along a route.

Reference-contexts: These regions are represented as nodes inside the decision structure. As shown in figure 6, these nodes as well as 4 MULTILEVEL ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOUR the connections between them are generated during operation, such that the decision structure D is built incrementally. The applied method is similar to incremental clustering <ref> [2] </ref>. Let B = ((x s ; y s ); (x g ; y g )) be the example to be classified.
