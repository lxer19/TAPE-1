Abstract: We present a new solution to the correspondence problem. It is based on dynamic programming, and can deal with image sequences. The overall potential characterizes the quality of matching of a point, and dynamic programming achieves consistency independently for each edge of the new image. The overall potential is defined on a pair of points as a function of two components : a potential defined for each new point as a function of its Mahalanobis distance to the old edges, and a potential associated to their respective edges on the basis of their relative distance and orientation. Finally, occlusions, artifacts and ambiguities are dealt with by applying relaxation to the different solutions found by dynamic programming, where the compatibility coefficients associated to the empty label are updated at each iteration.

Reference-contexts: Dynamic programming is a successful method of optimization. The basic approach consists in defining a cost or potential depending on the local characteristics of the image and to perform an iterative summation-minimization process. The absence of any threshold is an important factor of robustness. In particular, Baker <ref> [1] </ref> and Ohta [5] showed how to apply it to the correspondence problem. They first rectify the pair of stereo images so that the epipolar lines are parallel to the scan-lines. <p> A 2D array is then built for a couple of corresponding lines, and the cost measures the similarity between corresponding features, grey-levels, and intervals. The consistency between successive lines is achieved either with a cooperative process to correct errors <ref> [1] </ref> or by searching a 3D space [5]. In our solution, the overall potential characterizes the quality of matching of a point and its sum is computed along each edge. This potential has two components.

Reference-contexts: We then propagate from the edge points until the limit of the (approximated) ellipse associated to the edge and to the threshold. Instead of propagating the distance values <ref> [2] </ref>, we propagate the label of the closest edge point and compute directly d m with respect to it. Initially we mark in the 2D surface the pixels corresponding to the measurements of the edge points with their own label. The other pixels are null pointers. <p> All the experiments were performed with 128x120 images. The essential of the work (dynamic programming and relaxation) is done in fractions of seconds. Current research involves computing only the part of the Mahalanobis map really needed, or using a smaller resolution, or approximating the distance <ref> [2] </ref>. 7 Conclusion We have presented a new approach for performing matching of edge points, with dynamic programming.

Reference-contexts: We want to keep for each edge only the label l having the minimum of conflicts with other edges, through relaxation labeling <ref> [3] </ref>. Each edge may be matched with the empty path. For each label l of each edge e i , we define an initial probability p 0 ( i = l ).

Reference-contexts: As in previous works <ref> [4] </ref>, we define the potential on sets of neighboring points. Now, the neighborhood of a point of the row y is defined as the set of the points of the rows y-1 and y+1, and we define the potential on a pair of points.
