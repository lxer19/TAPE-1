Abstract: We have developed a semi-automatic image segmentation tool which combines conventional manual segmentation utilities with a novel automatic image segmentation algorithm. Manual segmentation is achieved by dropping control points and fitting cubic splines to these points. Automatic segmentation is achieved by bimodally thresholding local windows of the target image and contour following. By combining these two segmentation methods, a user can obtain accurate boundary descriptions with much less effort.

Reference-contexts: In our implementation, we used a cubic spline interpolation method. The basic principles and some mathematics background on interpolation can be found in many algorithm or computer aided geometry design books [RA76] <ref> [Far93] </ref>. 3 Automatic image segmentation We developed an automatic algorithm which allows users to interactively steer the segmentation process. The program starts by asking the user to pick an initial point on the image.

Reference-contexts: Given slices of 2D images, the boundaries of interesting regions must be defined before surface reconstruction, mesh generation, and other modeling operations begins. Although image segmentation and contour/edge detections have been investigated for quite a long time [Rus92] [Sch89] <ref> [RK82] </ref>, till now there is still no algorithm which can automatically find region boundaries perfectly. There are two reasons for this. One is that most of the image segmentation algorithms are still noise sensitive.
