Abstract: ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) aims at providing both guaranteed bandwidth to support real-time communications and dynamic bandwidth sharing to accommodate bursty data traffic. Achievement of this goal is vital to make ATM an enabling technology for the future integrated digital networks. To realize this objective, good algorithms for controlling network traffic are required. This paper proposes a traffic control scheme which uses a timed-round-robin cell transmission scheduling algorithm enhanced with a simple feedback flow control mechanism to realize the promised advantages of ATM networks. Specifically, with the proposed scheme, a network is able to provide each user with (1) a guaranteed bandwidth, (2) immediate access to the full link bandwidth when there is no contention from other users, and (3) free of cell losses. An ATM switch design is also presented which shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed scheme with today's switch architectures without adding much extra cost.

Reference-contexts: People have tried to solve the traffic control problem with two approaches: preventive control and reactive control. Preventive control tries to prevent a network from reaching an unacceptable level of congestion <ref> [11, 12] </ref>. A common approach is to control traffic flow at entry points of a network with admission control and bandwidth enforcement. <p> However, a consequence of this dynamic bandwidth sharing is that it becomes difficult to provide bandwidth guarantees to connections. One approach to solve this problem in ATM networks is to use a Stop-and-Go cell transmission scheme <ref> [11] </ref>. Similar to STM, Stop-and-Go divides time into frames. But instead of allocating fixed time-slots within each frame to connections, Stop-and-Go uses a stop-queue and a go-queue to limit the number of cells that each connection can transmit during each time frame.

Reference-contexts: So preventive traffic control is suitable for constant bit-rate transmissions, but may cause unacceptable low efficiency for bursty data traffics. Also, many traffic policing and scheduling schemes turned out to be very costly to implement in practice <ref> [20] </ref>. Reactive control, on the other hand, admits traffic according to the current network load condition with a feedback mechanism [21, 22, 23, 24]. A network can accept traffic with its best effort and there is no pre-set limit on the amount of traffic that each connection can carry.

Reference-contexts: Easy implementation. Adding any traffic control functions will inevitably increase the implementation complexity.

Low cost is important to make the scheme implementable in commercial products (not just laboratory ones).

Reference-contexts: Also, there are no particular reasons for interleaving the unallocated transmission time ffi with the guaranteed transmission times in the way shown in Fig. 1. One may distribute ffi in some other ways for some purpose (e.g., easy implementation or low-latency communication <ref> [28] </ref>). We are not going to discuss these enhancements further in this paper. As expained in Algorithm 2.1, GT T =RRP fi link bandwidth is the bandwidth guaranteed to a connection over a link.

Reference-contexts: If the bandwidth allocated to a connection over an upstream link is larger than that over a downstream link, cell losses might happen <ref> [29] </ref>. Since a connection is usually established sequentially over links from its source to destination, this problem can be avoided by using the bandwidth actually allocated to a connection at an upstream link to calculate the GT T required at the next downstream link.
