Title: Global State Routing: A New Routing Scheme for Ad-hoc Wireless Networks

Abstract: In an ad-hoc environment with no wired communication infrastructure, it is necessary that mobile hosts operate as routers in order to maintain the information about connectivity. However, with the presence of high mobility and low signal/interference ratio (SIR), traditional routing schemes for wired networks are not appropriate, as they either lack the ability to quickly reflect the changing topology, or may cause excessive overhead, which degrades network performance. Considering these restrictions, we propose a new scheme especially designed for routing in an ad-hoc wireless environments. We call this scheme Global State Routing (GSR), where nodes exchange vectors of link states among their neighbors during routing information exchange. Based on the link state vectors, nodes maintain a global knowledge of the network topology and optimize their routing decisions locally. The performance of the algorithm, studied in this paper through a series of simulations, reveals that this scheme provides a better solution than existing approaches in a truly mobile, ad-hoc environment.

Reference-contexts: Di-jkstra's algorithm requires typically O (N 2 ) steps to compute the shortest paths from one source to all destinations, although it is possible to reduce it to O (N logN ) <ref> [12] </ref>. O (N 2 ) memory space is required to store the network topology represented by a connection matrix.

Reference-contexts: Three routing schemes: DBF, LS and GSR are used exclusively in the simulation. The DBF and LS are based on the schemes described in <ref> [13] </ref>. Both DBF and GSR can be executed with a routing update interval (I) specified at run time. By default, I is set to 3 (one update per three time slots), while in LS, nodes flood link state packets whenever they detect changes in their local connectivities.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 7 shows the decrease in routing error rate as transmission range increases. Larger transmission range means more nodes can be reached in one hop without requiring routing decision. However, as indicated in <ref> [14] </ref>, the spatial reuse is less efficient when transmission range is large. It is interesting to note that, the worst case doesn't happens when R = 80, which is the smallest range in our simulation. Instead, it happens at about R = 150, regardless of mobility. <p> Our future plan includes the evaluation of MAC layer impact to the routing efficiency. This requires enhancements to our simulators with different MAC layers such as MACA, MACA/PR and Cluster/TDMA <ref> [14] </ref>. QoS routing for multimedia support in wireless environment is also considered to be embedded in GSR since it provides higher routing accuracy without sacrificing bandwidth. Besides simulation, implementing GSR in an IP wireless testbed is also in progress.
