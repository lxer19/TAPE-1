The exact point matching problem has been solved in time O (n d2 log n) for d = d 0 and T the set of congruences (translations and rotations, and possibly a reflection); see Alt et al. <ref> [1] </ref> , earlier work by Atallah [3] and Atkinson [4] , and the recent work of Sprinzak and Werman [19] .

Alt et. al [1] applied techniques of computational geometry to give polynomial-time algorithms for a wide variety of inexact point matching problems. Several other papers have also obtained efficient algorithms for instances of the inexact point matching problem [2; 9; 10; 14; 17; 18] . <p> We note that in most applications the noise regions are assumed to be circles or aligned squares (disks in the L 2 or L 1 metric).

( (fl) Alt et. al <ref> [1] </ref>, (y) Sprinzak [17]) match means to produce a matching and to produce a witness transformation t that achieves the matching: t (a i ) 2 B j for each (a i ; b j ) 2 . <p> The case we discuss here is that of equal cardinality (m = n) and of pairwise-disjoint noise regions. For the case of pure translation (T = T ), Alt et al. <ref> [1] </ref> showed that there is at most one match when the noise regions are unit circles. <p> Alt et al. <ref> [1] </ref> show that there is at most one match in the case in which the noise regions are disjoint unit circles in the plane. We generalize their result to the case of linearly separable noise regions. In particular, our result applies to the case of pairwise-disjoint convex noise regions. <p> The proof is an extension of the proof in Alt et al. <ref> [1] </ref> . A perfect matching is a permutation on the sequence f1; : : :; ng. A cycle is defined as a cyclic shift of a subset of points between regions. <p> Consider two points 1 ; 2 2 fi, and let t 1 ; t 2 2 Q be corresponding similarity transformations. The convexity of Q implies that t = t 1 + (1 )t 2 2 Q, for 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. We denote the coordinates of t by (x (); y (); r 1 (); r 2 ()). <p> The value () lies in set fi (by definition of fi), and is a continuous function of , as seen by writing sin () = q 1 () + r 2 ; cos () = q 1 () + r 2 : Then f (cos (); sin ()) j 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>g gives a (continuous) path in fi 1 , connecting (cos 1 ; sin 1 ) with (cos 2 ; sin 2 ). 2 Remark. <p> We need to bound the number of possible matches in this bipartite graph. As in Alt et al. <ref> [1] </ref> , we proceed to solve the matching problem in the bipartite graph, as follows. For each node u of degree one, we delete the node u, add the corresponding edge (u; v) to the matching, and delete the other edges incident to v. <p> By exploiting the special nature of pairwise-disjoint noise regions, we obtain running times better than those previously known <ref> [1; 2] </ref> for the general case. We begin with noise regions that are linearly separable polygons (not necessarily normal) and the allowed motion is pure rotation. Theorem 5 showed that there can be at most O (n 2 ) matches. <p> This implies that this incremental construction requires O (n) time. 2 Remark. Alt et al. <ref> [1] </ref> give an O (n log n) algorithm for the case of matching under pure rotation when the noise regions are allowed to overlap arbitrarily; Iwanowski [15] shows a lower bound of (n log n) for this general case.
