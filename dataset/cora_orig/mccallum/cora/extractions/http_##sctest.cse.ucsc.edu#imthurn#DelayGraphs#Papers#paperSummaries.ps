Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction I found three approaches to delay fault diagnosis in my literature search. I will briefly discuss each approach, and list the pertinent papers in a bibliography. All three approachs were structural, in that they looked at circuit topology. 2 Cox and Rajski Cox and Rajski <ref> [1, 12] </ref> perform fault diagnosis for multiple faults using a 16-value alphabet. The fundimental idea in this method is to keep track of the set of line values possible in the presence of any single or multiple fault.

Reference-contexts: It sounds like they group static and dynamic hazards with final values of 0 under T 0; similarly for T 1. So their algebra is not identical to that of Cox and Rajski. They apparently also use a 6-value alphabet <ref> [2] </ref> that they claim adds accuracy to their diagnosis, but UCSC don't get this particular periodical. 3.1 Their Method They diagnose only single gate-delay faults (as do we); they claim their method is valid for path-delay faults as well.

Reference-contexts: we use this or another structural approach to improve our results? Yes, probably, but we risk sullying our pretty little procedure with practical concerns like "Does it work?" and "How can we make it better?". 3 Girard, Landrault, and Pravossoudovitch These guys (GLP) use CPT to do delay fault diagnosis <ref> [5, 10, 6, 3, 11, 4, 7, 9, 8] </ref>. They appear to be the leading people in the field, in that I found many of their articles when I did the literature search, and not many for other groups. GLP use a 4-value alphabet fC0; C1; T 0; T 1g.

Very briefly, their process is (and I quote): 1. Preprocess the circuit model to determine a logic-level order. This gives the level of each gate in the fault-free circuit. 2.

Reference-contexts: It might be interesting to look at how we do with these faults, particulary the c432, where the diagnosis size was always less than 10. 4 Sivaraman and Strojwas These guys are the most confusing and the least understood of the three, mostly because they use BDDs in their approach <ref> [14, 13] </ref>; perhaps they should consider group therapy instead. Their main beef is with the test pattern generation people, who like to use vectors that will detect many faults; this makes things difficult for the poor diagnosticians.
