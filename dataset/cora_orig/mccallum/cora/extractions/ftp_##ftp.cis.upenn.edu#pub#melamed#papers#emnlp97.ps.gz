Abstract: Automatic segmentation of text into minimal content-bearing units is an unsolved problem even for languages like English. Spaces between words offer an easy first approximation, but this approximation is not good enough for machine translation (MT), where many word sequences are not translated word-for-word. This paper presents an efficient automatic method for discovering sequences of words that are translated as a unit. The method proceeds by comparing pairs of statistical translation models induced from parallel texts in two languages. It can discover hundreds of non-compositional compounds on each iteration, and constructs longer compounds out of shorter ones. Objective evaluation on a simple machine translation task has shown the method's potential to improve the quality of MT output. The method makes few assumptions about the data, so it can be applied to parallel data other than parallel texts, such as word spellings and pronunci ations.

Reference-contexts: The caution that we have displayed thus far in limiting ourselves to cepts with fewer than two words was motivated primarily by our respect for the featureless desert that multi-word cepts offer a priori. <ref> (Brown et al., 1993) </ref> The heuristics in Section 6 are designed specifically to find the interesting features in that featureless desert. Furthermore, translational equivalence relations involving explicit representations of target-language NCCs are more useful than fertility distributions for applications that do translation by table lookup.

Reference-contexts: However, they are only useful if they can be discovered reliably and efficiently. Their time may come when we have a better understanding of how to model the human translation process. 10 Conclusion It is well known that two languages are more informative than one <ref> (Dagan et al., 1991) </ref>. I have argued that texts in two languages are not only preferable but necessary for discovery of non-compositional compounds for translation-related applications. Given a method for constructing statistical translation models, NCCs can be discovered by maximizing the models' information-theoretic predictive value over parallel data sets.

Reference-contexts: To the extent that translation-oriented definitions of compositionality overlap with other definitions, NCC lists derived from parallel data may benefit other applications where NCCs play a role, such as information retrieval <ref> (Evans & Zhai, 1996) </ref> and language modeling for speech recognition (Ries et al., 1996). To the extent that different applications have different objective functions, optimizing these functions can benefit from an understanding of how they differ.

Reference-contexts: words translate to the most frequent target word would score surprisingly high! E.g. a French to English translation method that outputs "the the the the . . . " would recall more than 6% of English words. kind of BiBLE evaluation has been estimated at 62% precision and 60% recall <ref> (Melamed, 1995) </ref>. The purpose of BiBLE is internally valid comparison, rather than externally valid benchmarking. On a sufficiently large test bitext, BiBLE can expose the slightest differences in translation quality. The number of NCCs validated on each iteration was never more than 2.5% of the vocabulary size.

Reference-contexts: This objective function may also be used for optimizing cross-language information retrieval, where translational distributions must be estimated either for queries or for documents before queries and documents can be compared <ref> (Oard & Dorr, 1996) </ref>. recognition of NCCs increases the mutual information of translation models.

Reference-contexts: Several authors have used mutual information and similar statistics as an objective function for word clustering (Dagan et al., 1993; Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Wang et al., 1996), for automatic determination of phonemic baseforms (Lu-cassen & Mercer, 1984), and for language modeling for speech recognition <ref> (Ries et al., 1996) </ref>. Although the applications considered in this paper are different, the strategy is similar: search a space of data models for the one with maximum predictive power. Wang et al. (1996) also employ parallel texts and independence assumptions that are similar to those described in Section 6. <p> To the extent that translation-oriented definitions of compositionality overlap with other definitions, NCC lists derived from parallel data may benefit other applications where NCCs play a role, such as information retrieval (Evans & Zhai, 1996) and language modeling for speech recognition <ref> (Ries et al., 1996) </ref>.
