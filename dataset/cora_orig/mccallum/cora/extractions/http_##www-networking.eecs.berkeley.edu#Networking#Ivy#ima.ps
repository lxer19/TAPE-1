Abstract: We start with a brief review of ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) technology and the control actions that networks can take. We then present methods to estimate the small loss probabilities in ATM networks. Small losses are achieved by averaging traffic over time in a large buffer, or by multiplexing a large number of sources when the buffer is small or negligible. In the first case (large buffer), we discuss the notions of effective and decoupling bandwidths. In the second case (many sources), we show that a good estimate of the loss probability can be obtained using a theorem of Bahadur and Rao. We propose a call admission strategy in which connections with tight delay constraints, such as interactive audio/video, are given service priority. The delay constraints limit the acceptable buffer size. Thus the many sources asymptotic is appropriate in estimating the loss rate of such service. Effective and decoupling bandwidths are then used for the control of connections that can tolerate longer delays due to large buffers.

For the same two-state sources as above, we fix N = 100, and plot the results over a range of values for b in Figure 2. Note that in this case the overflow probability does not improve very much by the presence of a small buffer.

Reference-contexts: The rate control is open-loop and limits the burstiness of the stream. A simple mechanism for doing this is the so-called leaky bucket. (A variation is the generic cell rate algorithm GCRA recommended by the ATM forum. See <ref> [2] </ref>.) Essentially, the algorithm grants permits at a fixed rate but only a specified number of permits can be accumulated. To transmit a cell, the stream must use up one of its permits.

Numerical and simulation experiments show that admission control based on the notions of effective and decoupling bandwidth may be too conservative.

Methods for on-line estimation of the effective bandwidth are the subject of current research and so are adaptive techniques for selecting a suitable value of C. The above result deals with a single buffer and may be usable for a local ATM network.

Reference-contexts: We combine the analysis of Weiss <ref> [14] </ref> with our application of the Bahadur-Rao theorem. Recall the model. There are N i.i.d. sources that share a buffer with capacity N b and served at rate N c. Following Weiss, we argue that the buffer overflows because of the conjunction of two events. <p> Second, their total rate continues to exceed N c 11 long enough so that the buffer accumulates N b cells and starts overflowing. We calculated the probability of the first event in the previous section, using the Bahadur-Rao theorem. In <ref> [14] </ref>, Weiss calculates that, for ON-OFF sources, the likelihood of the second event is approximately given by exp (N C 2 b) when N is large. The value of C 2 depends on the parameters of the sources.
