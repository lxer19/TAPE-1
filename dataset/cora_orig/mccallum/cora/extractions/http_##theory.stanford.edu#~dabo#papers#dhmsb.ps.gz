Abstract: We show that computing the most significant bits of the secret key in a Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol from the public keys of the participants is as hard as computing the secret key itself. This is done by studying the following hidden number problem: Given an oracle O ff (x) that on input x computes the k most significant bits of ff g x mod p, find ff modulo p. Our solution can be used to show the hardness of msb's in other schemes such s ElGamal's public key system, Shamir's message passing scheme and Okamoto's conference key sharing scheme. Our results lead us to suggest a new variant of Diffie-Hellman key exchange (and other systems), for which we prove the most significant bit is hard to compute.

Reference-contexts: If one is allowed to query the oracle O ff (t) at chosen values of t, then recovering ff is much simpler. The study of this unrestricted problem is closely related to proving the bit security of the RSA cryptosystem as in <ref> [ACGS88] </ref>, whose methods can be used to completely solve this problem. Namely, with chosen queries, the hnp can be solved when k = 1 even when the oracle is noisy; i.e. the oracle computes the msb only on 1=2 + "; " &gt; 0 fraction of x correctly.

Reference-contexts: The same arguments as above show that given an oracle computing the single most significant bit of m is equivalent to computing all of m. We caution here that when used for ElGamal signatures, smooth generators are bad <ref> [B96] </ref>. A possible drawback of these new variants is that they rely on the hardness of DH g (g y ; 2) for their security which needs further study. This is a special case of the Diffie-Hellman function which could potentially be easier to break.

Reference-contexts: This may be of interest on its own and a solution is given in [Schn94]. Reducing k to log log p bits : Recently, results from <ref> [BV96] </ref> show that there exist polynomial number of advice bits depending only on p and g which enable one to solve the hnp in polynomial time using an oracle which returns only log log p bits. <p> The same result holds for the secret key of the Okamoto conference scheme, for which our recent work <ref> [BV96] </ref> improves the result to log logp bits in the non-uniform model. It would be interesting to improve these results to a single bit case, and also to the case of a noisy oracle that answers only 1 2 + " fraction of its queries correctly.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The discrete logarithm problem (dlp) relative to a base g in ZZ fl p is to find x given y = g x . Assuming this problem to be hard, Diffie and Hellman <ref> [DH76] </ref> proposed a public key system. Here two participants, Alice and Bob, with private keys a and b respectively, compute g a and g b and send each other these values. Then they compute a secret key g ab .

Reference-contexts: A number of cryptographic schemes proposed are related to or based on the Diffie-Hellman function dh g (g a ; g b ) = g ab . These schemes depend on the "hidden" nature of g ab . For examples, we refer to ElGamal's public key cryptosys-tem <ref> [EG85] </ref>, Shamir's message passing scheme [Kob87, pp. 96-97], Bellare-Micali non-interactive oblivious transfer [MB89] and Okamoto conference key sharing scheme [Oka88]. In this paper, we study the security of the msb's of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange scheme and the related schemes mentioned above.

Reference-contexts: Remark: (Predicting Truncated Random Number Sequences) Here an iterative pseudo-random generator computes a sequence x i ; i 1; and outputs msb k (x i ). The task is to observe the outputs for a short period and break the generator by inferring the whole sequence. See <ref> [FHK fl 88] </ref> for discussion and references. One equation they study is x i+1 = ax i mod M and they show how to break the generator when k is constant times log M=(log log M ) (Theorem 3.1 page 273 and its accompanying remark 3).
