Abstract: Accurate registration of surfaces is a common problem in computer vision. Several algorithms exist to refine an approximate value for the pose to an accurate value. They are all more or less variants of the Iterated Closest Point algorithm of Besl and McKay (1992). Up to now the problem of determining the uncertainty in the pose estimate thus obtained has not been addressed in detail. In this paper we present a framework in which to quantify the uncertainty in pose. We introduce a new parameter called the registration index to give a simple means of quantifying the pose errors one might expect when registering a particular shape.

Reference-contexts: Two distinct problems may be addressed by "surface registration" algorithms. The model-scene case arises when we have an exact model and wish to register it to scene measurements. The scene-scene case arises when we wish to register (and possibly fuse <ref> (Hilton et al., 1996) </ref>) two separate scene measurements of the same object. The registration method is usually the same but for a correct statistical analysis of the errors the two cases need to be treated slightly differently. <p> The objective is to register the data to the model and then find the largest or average deviation of the object from the model. Other applications include navigation and surface fusion <ref> (Hilton et al., 1996) </ref>. 2 Notation In order to present our notation we begin by considering the familiar problem of pose estimation from two point sets with correspondence. Various analytical solutions exist, and we use the SVD method of (Kanatani, 1994).

The rotation may be specified British Machine Vision Conference by an axis ^n and angle . Equivalently it may be specified by the 3 fi 3 rotation matrix R or the 3 component vector r = ^n.

Reference-contexts: The Extended Kalman filter provides a good framework to solve this problem . Finally we need to evaluate the partial derivatives. This is not straightforward due to the nonlinear nature of rotations, and for details we refer the reader to <ref> (Pennec and Thirion, 1995b) </ref>. 2.1 Frame covariance This resolves the question of how to compute frame covariance. However we must ask whether it makes sense. <p> In addition it will be specific to a particular representation of f . These problems are related to the fact that rotations do not belong to a vector space. For further discussion see <ref> (Pennec and Thirion, 1995b) </ref>. In the applications that we will consider the errors are typically small so that the rotation errors are much less than 90 ffi . Infinitesimal rotations do form a vector space. <p> Indeed the third eigenvector is the same as ^a. In the limit of r ! 0 the covariance blows up consistent with a degenerate solution. 3 Surface Registration We wish to apply the ideas of <ref> (Pennec and Thirion, 1995b) </ref> to the case of surface registration. At the heart of most ICP algorithms is the use of the least squares criterion of equation (2). There is a serious problem with this which is best illustrated by example.
