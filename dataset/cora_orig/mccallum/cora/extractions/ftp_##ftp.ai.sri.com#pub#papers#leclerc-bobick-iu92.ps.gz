Title: The Direct Computation of Height from Shading

Abstract: We present a method of recovering shape from shading that solves directly for the surface height. By using a discrete formulation of the problem, we are able to achieve good convergence behavior by employing numerical solution techniques more powerful than gradient descent methods derived from variational calculus. Because we directly solve for height, we avoid the problem of finding an integrable surface maximally consistent with surface orientation. Furthermore, since we do not need additional constraints to make the problem well posed, we use a smoothness constraint only to drive the system towards a good solution; the weight of the smoothness term is eventually reduced to near zero. Also, by solving directly for height, we can use stereo processing to provide initial and boundary conditions. Our shape from shading technique, as well as its relation to stereo, is demonstrated on both synthetic and real imagery.

Reference-contexts: Such events include discontinuities in surface orientation and albedo, such as material boundaries and resolvable textures. Where no such events occur, all stereo algorithms determine surface structure by interpolation, whether explicitly (e.g. (Grimson 1982)) or implicitly by choice of objective function (e.g. <ref> (Barnard 1989) </ref>). Grimson justified this interpolation in stating that "No news is good news," implying that the lack of significant events could be viewed as permitting the use of some assumed interpolation function.

Reference-contexts: One implication of this type of approach is that smooth albedo variations would be incorrectly interpreted as shape information; the effectiveness of makeup to give the illusion of greater depth variation is an example of such an incorrect interpretation. Many stereo algorithms <ref> (Fua 1991, Hannah 1982) </ref> already provide a confidence measure reflecting the degree of constraint present in the pixel matches. We are currently investigating the use of this measure as a method for generating an integrated stereo and shading algorithm that applies each where best suited.
