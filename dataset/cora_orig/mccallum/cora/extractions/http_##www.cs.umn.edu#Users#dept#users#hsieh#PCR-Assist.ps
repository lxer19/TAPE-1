Abstract: Transmitting compressed variable bit rate video with traditional constant bit-rate (CBR) service for continuous playback requires a large buffer at the viewer's side. In this paper, we study two new CBR transmission schemes, called PCR-assist CBR (PCBR) and PCR-assist Dual-Rate CBR (PDCBR), which employ the Program Clock References (PCR) embedded in the MPEG-2 Transport Streams to reduce the buffer requirement. The two schemes reduce buffer requirement by using the timing information provided by the PCRs to regulate their transmission. The PCBR scheme uses PCRs to examine its transmission regularly. It holds up the transmission if it is ahead of schedule. The PCBR scheme requires higher transmission rates than traditional CBR service. To reduce the transmission rate, we introduce the PDCBR scheme which dynamically changes its transmission between two rates. It uses a low rate if the transmission is ahead of schedule and uses a high rate if the transmission is behind the schedule. In fact, PCBR can be considered as a special case of PDCBR with the low rate as zero. Based on the experimental results with video traces, the PCBR scheme reduces the buffer requirement at the cost of higher transmission rate. The PDCBR scheme provides more flexible trade-off between buffer requirement and transmission rates.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Delivering variable bit-rate (VBR) compressed video over high speed networks has been studied by a number of researchers <ref> [2, 9, 10, 11, 13] </ref>. For transmitting pre-recorded VBR compressed video (called stored video) with traditional CBR service, McManus and Ross have developed a fundamental relationship between the buffer requirement and transmission rates [10]. They reported that it requires a very large buffer at the viewer's side for continuous playback. <p> This makes the CBR scheme infeasible under practical consideration since the viewer side may only have a decoder with limited memory space. Other studies have considered piecewise CBR service for the delivery of stored video in order to reduce the buffer requirement <ref> [2, 9, 11, 13] </ref>. In this paper, we study two new CBR transmission schemes, called PCR-assist CBR (PCBR) and PCR-assist Dual-Rate CBR (PDCBR). They utilize the time stamps inserted by the encoder to regulate the transmission and to reduce the buffer requirement at the viewer's side.

Reference-contexts: These two schemes keep track of their transmission and dynamically adjust their transmission rates based on the schedule information provided by PCRs. PCBR and PDCBR schemes provide a transmission schedule which is an approximation of the "perfect schedule". The PCBR scheme was introduced by IBM Rochester <ref> [4] </ref>. In PCBR scheme, a rate higher than the average rate required by the MPEG-2 TS is used as the transmission rate. The PCRs in the TS are used to hold up the transmission if it is ahead of the schedule. <p> If the consumption rate can not match the transmission rate, large amount of data will be accumulated in the client's buffer. In this section, we describe a new scheme proposed by IBM Rochester <ref> [4] </ref>, called PCR-assist CBR (PCBR), which utilizes the PCRs embedded in MPEG-2 streams to regulate the outgoing traffic. In PCBR, a CBR virtual channel is established with a transmission rate higher than the required average rate of MPEG-2 TS.

They reported that it requires a very large buffer at the viewer's side for continuous playback. This makes the CBR scheme infeasible under practical consideration since the viewer side may only have a decoder with limited memory space. <p> Moreover, when transmitting VBR-coded MPEG streams for continuous playback, it often requires a large buffer at the receiving side to accommodate accumulated data due to the difference between the transmission and the data consumption by decoder <ref> [10] </ref>. In this paper, we study two new CBR transmission schemes, called PCR-assist CBR (PCBR) and PCR-assist Dual-Rate CBR (PDCBR), which utilize the PCRs embedded in MPEG-2 TS. These two schemes keep track of their transmission and dynamically adjust their transmission rates based on the schedule information provided by PCRs. <p> Therefore, CBR service requires certain amount of data be transmitted and stored in the client's buffer before the commencement of playback. The fundamental relationship between the start-up delay, transmission rate, and the size of buffer at the client side has been studied in <ref> [10] </ref>. Analytically, the transmission rate can be determined base on content of the MPEG-2 stream and the length of start-up delay. <p> Eventually, b 1 becomes the dominant component, i.e. max (b 1 ; b 2 ) = b 1 . 4 PCR-assist CBR Using CBR service to transmit MPEG-2 streams requires a large buffer and a long startup delay, especially for VBR-coded MPEG streams <ref> [10] </ref>. With CBR services, the server keep transmitting MPEG-2 streams at a constant rate. The transmission rate should be high enough in order to prevent starvation occurs in the client's buffer. <p> The minimum rate and buffer requirement under CBR scheme will be used as a basis to compare with two PCR-assist transmission schemes. We call the minimum rate requirement as R CBR . As mentioned in <ref> [10] </ref>, if a rate lower than R CBR is used to deliver a video stream, the delivery curve will intersect with the consumption curve, indicating a buffer starvation situation.
