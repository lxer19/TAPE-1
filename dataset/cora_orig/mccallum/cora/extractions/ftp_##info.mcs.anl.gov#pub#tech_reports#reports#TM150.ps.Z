Reference-contexts: This choice leads to a system of nonlinear equations with 320 variables. A plot of the computed tangential velocity u 0 for several values of R appears in Figure 2.1; similar results were obtained by Ascher <ref> [1] </ref> with k = 5. Note, in particular, the steep gradient near t = 0 as R increases. <p> The problem is of the form f i (x) = n j=1 Z 1 T i () d; where T i is the i-th Chebyshev polynomial shifted to the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. In this problem any m n is allowed, but in the discussion below it is assumed that m = n. This problem was formulated by Fletcher [8]. The Chebyshev problem has a zero residual solution for 1 n 7 and for n = 9. <p> Such a zero residual solution can be obtained without difficulty from the standard starting point, but the problem becomes difficult to solve from the starting point 10x s unless bounds are imposed. Since the nodes are required to be in the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, the bounds 0 x j 1 for 1 j n are natural. There seems to be a unique minimum of the least squares problem for n = 8 and n = 11.

Reference-contexts: This problem is interesting because it is easy to solve for small Reynolds numbers but becomes increasingly difficult to solve as R increases. This problem was formulated by Huang [12]. In our formulation we have followed Ascher, Mattheij, and Russell <ref> [2, p. 7] </ref>. We solve this nonlinear boundary value problem by a k-stage collocation method. <p> 1 j k: The piecewise polynomial approximation u in the interval [t i ; t i+1 ] is of the form m X (t t i ) j1 v ij + h m k X OE j ( h i where we choose the basis representation (Ascher, Mattheij, and Russell <ref> [2, pp. 247-249] </ref>) OE j (t) = (m + j 1)! A simple computation shows that in this representation v ij = u (j1) and that w ij = h i u (m+j1) Thus, bounds on a derivative of u at t i can be specified by bounding v ij or <p> This problem is interesting since it is easy to solve for * close to 1 but becomes increasingly difficult to solve as * decreases. In our formulation we have followed Parter [24]. (We note that there is a typographical error in the formulation of Ascher, Mattheij, and Russell <ref> [2, p. 23] </ref>; in this reference the first equation is *f 0000 The swirling flow problem is described by a (coupled) system of boundary value problems. Systems of this type can be solved by a natural extension of the k-stage collocation method discussed above.

Reference-contexts: This formulation of the ff-pinene problem is based on the work of Box, Hunter, MacGregor, and Erjavac <ref> [3] </ref>. The ff-pinene problem is a typical example of inverse problems involving differential equations that arise in chemical kinetics.

Reference-contexts: The convex set K is defined by K = fv 2 H 1 In the formulation of Cimatti <ref> [4] </ref>, all functions in K were required to be periodic in the first argument with period 2; in our formulation we have neglected the periodicity conditions. A finite element approximation to the journal bearing problem is obtained as in the torsion problem.

Reference-contexts: This problem is harder to solve than the elastic-plastic torsion problem unless the problem is scaled so that the diagonal elements in the matrix that represents q are unity. Numerical results for the journal bearing problem are presented, for example, by Lin and Cryer [14], Cimatti and Menchi <ref> [5] </ref>, and More and Toraldo [19]. 4.3 Minimal Surfaces The determination of the surface with minimal area and given boundary values in a convex domain D is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem of the form minff (v) : v 2 Kg; where f : K ! &lt; is the functional f (v)

Reference-contexts: In this problem n = 8. This problem was formulated by Nelson and Hodgkin [20]. In our formulation we have followed Dennis, Gay, and Vu <ref> [6] </ref>. They also propose a six-variable version of this problem, obtained by using the first two equations to eliminate two of the first four variables. We have not implemented this reduced problem. There are five versions of the eight-variable problem depending on the data and the starting point.

Reference-contexts: In general, the problem becomes easier to solve as c increases because then the linear term in q dominates. Numerical results for the elastic-plastic torsion problem are presented, for example, by O'Leary and Yang [22], Elliott and Ockendon <ref> [7, pp. 124-125] </ref>, and More and Toraldo [19]. 4.2 Pressure Distribution in a Journal Bearing The journal bearing problem arises in the determination of the pressure distribution in a thin film of lubricant between two circular cylinders.

Reference-contexts: In this problem any m n is allowed, but in the discussion below it is assumed that m = n. This problem was formulated by Fletcher <ref> [8] </ref>. The Chebyshev problem has a zero residual solution for 1 n 7 and for n = 9. Note that the solution is not unique because any permutation of the variables also yields a solution. Thus, there are n! distinct zero residual solutions.

Reference-contexts: The one-dimensional system under consideration consists of alternating layers of lead and tin. Our formulation is based on the work of Garner and Benedek <ref> [9] </ref>. The optimization problem is to minimize the Gibbs free energy as a function of the temperature.
Reference: [10] <author> R. Glowinski, </author> <title> Numerical Methods for Nonlinear Variational Problems, </title> <publisher> Springer-Verlag, </publisher> <year> 1984. </year>
Reference-contexts: This formulation and the physical interpretation of the torsion problem are discussed, for example, in Glowinski <ref> [10, pp. 41-55] </ref>. A finite element approximation to the torsion problem is obtained by triangulating D and replacing the minimization of q over H 1 0 (D) by the minimization of q over the set of piecewise linear functions that satisfy the constraints specified by K.

Reference-contexts: Our formulation follows the approach of Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna <ref> [11] </ref>. Let D in &lt; 2 be a bounded domain, and let w &lt; jDj, where jDj denotes the area of D. <p> We assume that 1 &lt; 2 . 26 10 30 50 70 90 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna <ref> [11] </ref> formulate the optimal design problem in terms of a family of problems of the form minff (v) : v 2 H 1 0 (D)g; where f : H 1 0 (D) ! &lt; is the functional f (v) = D (krv (x)k) + v (x) dx and : &lt; ! <p> Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna <ref> [11] </ref> describe how the solution of the maximization problem defined by can be used to generate a minimizing sequence for the optimal design problem.

The contour plot in Figure 4.5 and the plots of the region of homogenization in Figures 4.6 and 4.7 are similar to those obtained by Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna <ref> [11] </ref>. Note, however, that in these plots we used t 2 1 = 0:008, while Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna [11] used t 2 1 = 0:002. <p> The contour plot in Figure 4.5 and the plots of the region of homogenization in Figures 4.6 and 4.7 are similar to those obtained by Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna <ref> [11] </ref>. Note, however, that in these plots we used t 2 1 = 0:008, while Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna [11] used t 2 1 = 0:002. Another difference is that the homogenized region in these plots is connected, while this is not the case in the results of Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna [11]. 29 4.5 Inhomogeneous Superconductors This problem arises in the solution of the Ginzburg-Landau equations for inhomogeneous superconductors <p> however, that in these plots we used t 2 1 = 0:008, while Goodman, Kohn, and Reyna <ref> [11] </ref> used t 2 1 = 0:002.

The one-dimensional system under consideration consists of alternating layers of lead and tin. Our formulation is based on the work of Garner and Benedek [9].

Reference-contexts: The resultant approximation u (t; ) may not be smooth with respect to small variations in (Lyness <ref> [15] </ref> provides an interesting discussion of this point), but this approach allows the possibility of using optimization software that makes use of variable-accuracy evaluations to avoid the expense of full accuracy solutions whenever possible.

This formulation, however, uses the element variables of Meintjes and Morgan <ref> [17] </ref> to avoid the square roots in the function evaluations. <p> In this problem n = 5, p = 40, and R = 10. (We note that there is a typographical error in the paper of Meintjes and Morgan <ref> [17] </ref>; the last term in the equation defining f 4 should be 4Rx 5 and not +4Rx 5 .) This system of equations has four solutions with real components for p = 40 and R = 10.
