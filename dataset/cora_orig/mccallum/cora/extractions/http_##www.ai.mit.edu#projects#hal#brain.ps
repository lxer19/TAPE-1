Title: Building Brains for Rooms: Designing Distributed Software Agents  
Author: Michael H. Coen

Affiliation: MIT AI Lab  
Abstract: This paper argues that complex , embedded software agent systems are best constructed with parallel, layered architectures. These systems resemble Minskian Societies of Mind and Brooksian subsumption controllers for robots, and they demonstrate that complex behaviors can be had via the aggregates of relatively simple interacting agents. We illustrate this principle with a distributed software agent system that controls the behavior of our laboratorys Intelligent Room.

Reference-contexts: Introduction This paper argues that software agent systems that interact with dynamic and complex worlds are best constructed with parallel, layered architectures. We draw on Brooks subsumption architecture <ref> (Brooks, 1985) </ref> and Minskys Society of Mind (Minsky, 1986) theory to dispel the notion that sophisticated and highly capable agent systems need elaborately complex and centralized control. Towards this end, we present an implemented system of software agents that forms the backbone of our laboratorys Intelligent Room (Torrance, 1995).

Reference-contexts: And while the Intelligent Room is a fascinating project in itself, we will treat it here mainly as a testbed to learn more about how software agents can interact with other computational and real entities. Our approach has also been modeled on a somewhat unorthodox combination of the Brooks <ref> (Brooks, 1991) </ref> and Minsky approaches to core AI research. As pointed out in (Kautz et. al., 1994), it is difficult to find specific tasks for individual agents that are both feasible and useful given current technology. <p> For example, if I lose my keys in the Intelligent Room, Id someday simply like to ask the room where I left them. The Intelligent Room is an excellent environment in which to conduct core AI research according to the criteria of both Brooks <ref> (Brooks, 1991) </ref> and Etzioni (Etzioni, 1994), The room is physically grounded in the real-world. The rooms cameras and microphones allow it to deal allow it to deal with the kinds of complex, unpredictable and genuine phenomena that Brooks argues is essential for a core AI research testbed.

Reference-contexts: SodaBot Although we managed to use the monolithic approach for several very simple applications, it seemed unlikely to scale to the more complex interactions we had in mind for the room. Our initial dissatisfaction with this architecture led to the adoption of the SodaBot software agent platform <ref> (Coen, 1994) </ref> for duplicating the functionality of our initial monolithic room controller with a system of distributed software agents. SodaBot provides both a programming language and runtime platform for software agents, and it simplifies writing interactive programs by providing high-level primitives for directing flows of online information.

Reference-contexts: A speech recognition system developed by ( Zue, 1994) allows the room to listen to its inhabitants, and it is used in conjunction with a speech generator to enable to the room to engage in sustained dialogues with people. The room interfaces with the START natural-language information retrieval system <ref> (Katz, 1990) </ref> to enhance its ability to understand complex linguistic input. The room also controls two VCRs and several other video displays in addition to the ceiling mounted projectors. A matrix switcher allows arbitrary connections between the rooms audio/visual inputs and outputs.
