Title: Nonuniform Filterbank Design for Audio Signal Modeling  
Author: Michael Goodwin 
Address: Berkeley

Abstract: In audio analysis-synthesis based on the sinusoidal model, the signal can be represented as the sum of a deterministic component, which consists of a sum of sinusoids, and a stochastic component, which is a broadband noiselike process, for instance breath noise in a flute. In coding applications, a signal estimate based solely on the deterministic component is often used. For high-fidelity synthesis, however, the stochastic component must also be modeled and incorporated into the signal reconstruction. This paper presents a simple approach for designing a nonuniform filterbank based on the properties of the human auditory system; the short-term energies of the subband signals of the nonuniform filterbank provide an effective parameterization of the stochastic component of the signal model.

Reference-contexts: 1. Analysis-synthesis and signal modeling In analysis-synthesis of audio signals based on the sinusoidal model, a deterministic-plus-stochastic decomposition can be readily applied <ref> [1] </ref>: x [n] = d [n] + s [n] (1) The deterministic component consists of a sum of evolving sinusoidal partials: d [n] = p=1 A p [n]cosQ p [n] (2) where P [n] is the number of partials at time n. <p> The p-th partial is parameterized by its time-varying amplitude A p [n] and its total phase Q p [n], which describes its frequency evolution and phase offset. This sum-of-partials component is typically referred to in the literature as a sinusoidal model of the signal <ref> [1, 2] </ref>; the sinusoidal parameters are effective for representing musically salient signal features such as pitch and loudness. <p> The sinusoidal parameters of the deterministic component capture the primary information about musical signals, and provide a framework for coding the signal as well as carrying out desirable modifications such as pitch-shifting, time-scaling, and cross-synthesis <ref> [1, 2, 3] </ref>. For high-quality synthesis, however, the stochastic component must also be modeled and incorporated into the signal reconstruction [1, 4]. Without the stochastic component, the reconstructed signal tends to sound artificial; subtle noiselike features are imperative for realistic synthesis. <p> For high-quality synthesis, however, the stochastic component must also be modeled and incorporated into the signal reconstruction <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. Without the stochastic component, the reconstructed signal tends to sound artificial; subtle noiselike features are imperative for realistic synthesis. Generally, the sinusoidal model parameters of the deterministic component are derived on a frame-rate basis using the short-time Fourier transform.

Reference-contexts: For high-quality synthesis, however, the stochastic component must also be modeled and incorporated into the signal reconstruction <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. Without the stochastic component, the reconstructed signal tends to sound artificial; subtle noiselike features are imperative for realistic synthesis. Generally, the sinusoidal model parameters of the deterministic component are derived on a frame-rate basis using the short-time Fourier transform. <p> In that scenario, the above gain calculation can also be applied, provided that the postwindow overlap-adds to one for a stride of N=2 and that the energy in a given band does not change drastically from frame to frame. Additional details relating to this derivation can be found in <ref> [4] </ref>. This filterbank approach constitutes an effective framework for modeling the noiselike residual of the sinusoidal model in that it provides a small set of parameters that describe the general time-frequency behavior of the stochastic component.

Reference-contexts: The classical critical bandwidths, derived in experiments on noise masking and perception of complex sounds, are generally considered to be the bandwidths of these auditory filters at given center frequencies <ref> [5] </ref>. Early estimates of the critical bandwidth as a function of center frequency indicate a roughly constant value below 500 Hz and a linear increase for higher frequencies, resulting in the common interpretation of the auditory system as a constant-Q filter bank.

Reference-contexts: More recent experiments by Moore and Glasberg suggest that the low-frequency critical bandwidths are quadratically related to the center frequency <ref> [6] </ref>. They provide an expression for the equivalent rectangular bandwidths of the auditory filters that differs somewhat from classical critical band theory; this is shown in figure 1.

Reference-contexts: One useful choice for f [n] is the raised cosine pulse, common in digital communication applications <ref> [12] </ref>, which enables the filter responses to be controlled by way of the excess bandwidth parameter ff. The raised cosine is defined as f [n] = D 1 ff 1 n D 1 ff 1 n 2 (25) for M n M ; f [n] = 0 elsewhere.

Reference-contexts: This limitation supports a simple framework for understanding the filterbank: as explained below, the filterbank can be readily interpreted in terms of the window method for designing FIR filters <ref> [13] </ref>. This method suggests that a realizable FIR approximation of an ideal filter can be obtained by time-windowing the ideal filter's impulse response.
