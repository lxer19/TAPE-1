Abstract: A year ago, a new metaheuristic for graph coloring problems was introduced by Costa, Hertz and Dubuis. They have shown, with computer experiments, some clear indication of the benefits of this approach. Graph coloring has many applications specially in the areas of scheduling, assignments and timetabling. The metaheuristic can be classified as a memetic algorithm since it is based on a population search in which periods of local optimization are interspersed with phases in which new configurations are created from earlier well-developed configurations or local minima of the previous iterative improvement process. The new population is created using crossover operators as in genetic algorithms. In this paper we discuss how a methodology inspired in Competitive Analysis may be relevant to the problem of designing better crossover operators. RESUMO: No ultimo ano uma nova metaheurstica para o problema de colora~c~ao em grafos foi apre-sentada por Costa, Hertz e Dubuis. Eles mostraram, com experimentos computacionais, algumas indica~c~oes claras dos benefcios desta nova tecnica. Colora~c~ao em grafos tem muitas aplica~c~oes, especialmente na area de programa~c~ao de tarefas, localiza~c~ao e horario . A metaheurstica pode ser classificada como algoritmo memetico desde que seja baseada em uma busca de popula~c~ao cujos perodos de otimiza~c~ao local s~ao intercalados com fases onde novas configura~c~oes s~ao criadas a partir de boas configura~c~oes ou mnimos locais de itera~c~oes anteriores. A nova popula~c~ao e criada usando opera~c~oes de crossover como em algoritmos geneticos. Neste artigo apresen-tamos como uma metodologia baseada em Competitive Analysis pode ser relevante para construir opera~c~oes de crossover.

Reference-contexts: Introduction, Motivation and Previous Work Last year, Costa, Hertz and Dubuis, introduced a new "memetic algorithm" for graph coloring problems <ref> [1] </ref> and they have called it EDM (for "Evolutionary Descent Method"). Graph coloring has many applications specially in the areas of scheduling, assignments and timetabling and it is associated to problems in the NP-Hard class. <p> Regardless these details, the techniques have many analogies with new "hybrid" genetic algorithms as well as former methods like Scatter Search introduced by F. Glover in 1977 (see Refs. [40]-[45] in [7] and Refs. [23]-[24] in <ref> [1] </ref>). The impact that a suitable design of the crossover has in the overall performance of memetic and genetic approaches had been previously identified and it was well recognized in Refs. [2], [7], [9], [5], [6]. <p> The practicality of these approaches had been anticipated in Ref. [2] (see eqns. [10] and [11]). In this paper, we present an analysis of the crossover introduced in <ref> [1] </ref>. Our methodology is inspired on Competitive Analysis, a technique developed in connection with on-line algorithms. Part of our motivation is based on the good results obtained by Costa and coworkers on large random graphs of the class G n;p . <p> Part of our motivation is based on the good results obtained by Costa and coworkers on large random graphs of the class G n;p . To understand the problem and the crossover we need some definitions and the notation will follow that of Ref. <ref> [1] </ref>. Let G (V; E) be an undirected graph of vertex set V and edge set E, an independent set is a set I V such that every pair in I is not adjacent in G, i.e. fx; yg I ) (x; y) 62 E. <p> If we can not decide between c 1 and c 2 then we break ties chosing between them at random with the same probablity. The following pseudocode from Ref. <ref> [1] </ref> would clarify the procedure. <p> Finite size effect associated to the use of jV j = 100 might also be influentiate this selection. A "competitive-inspired" analysis We will discuss two cases, where the crossover introduced in Ref. <ref> [1] </ref> is studied. The analysis is inspired by the concept of Competitive Analysis. A problem is said to be on-line if it requires that irrevocable decisions which influence the output must be made before having a complete knowledge of the entire input. <p> But we must remark again that to act as an "adversary", as it is generally the case in these kind of competitive analysis, would be benefical to design more robust crossover operators. In Ref. <ref> [1] </ref> we can read: "... it is difficult, if not impossible, to find a q-coloring of a large graph G (more than 300 nodes) with q close to the chromatic number of G by applying directly a given algorithm A on the graph G." In connection with this statement, other algorithms

This comparison is done on an input-by-input basis.
