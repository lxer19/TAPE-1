Title: STABILIZING THE HIERARCHICAL BASIS BY APPROXIMATE WAVELETS  
Author: Panayot S. Vassilevski and Junping Wang 
Date: March 11, 1995  
Abstract: This paper proposes a stabilization of the classical hierarchical basis (HB) finite element method by modifying the standard nodal basis functions that correspond to the hierarchical complement (in the next finer discretization space) of any successive coarse dis-cretization space using computationally feasible approximate L 2 -projections onto the given coarse space. The corresponding multilevel additive and product algorithms give spectrally equivalent preconditioners and one action of such a preconditioner is of almost optimal order. The major results are regularity-free for the continuous problem (second order elliptic) and can be applied to problems with local refinement. Numerical results that illustrate the theory are presented.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction In this paper we study a modification of the classical hierarchical basis (HB) introduced by Yserentant [19], see also Bank, Dupont and Yserentant <ref> [4] </ref>, for finite element solution of second order elliptic boundary value problems. The method exploits modification of the nodal basis functions at a given discretization level k that correspond to the nodes that are not present at the most recent coarse triangulation (i.e., the triangulation at level k 1). <p> The multiplicative method with m = 0 corresponds to the method of Vassilevski [14], which in this case (i.e., exact blocks A (k) 11 ) coincides with the HB-MG method of Bank, Dupont and Yserentant <ref> [4] </ref>. The additive method with m = 0 is then a variant of the HB method of Yserentant [19].
