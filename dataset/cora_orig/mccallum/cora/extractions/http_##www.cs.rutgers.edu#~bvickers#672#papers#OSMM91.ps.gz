Reference-contexts: The d-replicated switch was shown to provide a similar performance to that of a d-dilated switch [17]. Adding a supplementary switch plane to the Banyan switch can also provide multiple paths between input and output port pairs. Anido et al. <ref> [1] </ref> considered a multipath switch constructed from two Banyan switches: one act as a routing network, while the other acts as a switching network. They discussed several path selection algorithms and their performance.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In recent years, the broadband ISDN (B-ISDN) has received increasing attention as a vehicle to accommodate a wide variety of communication applications <ref> [2] </ref>. B-ISDN is expected to support diverse applications ranging from low bit rate communications between terminals and host computers, to the broadcasting of high resolution videos. One of the most promising approaches for B-ISDN is the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).

Reference-contexts: The HOL blocking will be discussed again in subsection 4.5 in more detail. In the two papers discussed above [14, 16], the buffered Banyan switch is constructed of binary switching elements. In <ref> [3, 32] </ref>, it was shown that the buffered Banyan switch constructed of switching elements of size greater than two results in a higher throughput. <p> This observation leads to the following technique called bypass queueing in order to improve the performance of the buffered Banyan switch. Bubenik and Turner <ref> [3] </ref> proposed the bypass queueing discipline. In bypass queueing, when the HOL Oie et al. / Survey of Switching Techniques 7 blocking occurs cells in that particular input buffer bypass the HOL cell and sequentially join competition for the available output links until some cell wins competition. <p> They also analyzed the Banyan switch comprised of binary switching elements assuming bypass queueing, and showed that the maximum throughput is achieved when the size of an input link buffer at a switching element is 8. Bubenik et al. <ref> [3] </ref> studied the multiple-buffered Banyan switch of size N fi N constructed of binary switching elements. They showed, through simulation, that bypass queueing achieves the maximum throughput of 0.63, when N is large. <p> Hence, w is referred to as the window size. Different names have been used for this service discipline in different papers. For instance, it is called priority scheme in [12], and window policy in [15]. In <ref> [3] </ref>, bypass queueing discipline is used to describe the window selection discipline in the context of blocking switches. In this paper, we use window selection discipline. <p> As we saw in subsection 4.1.2, the Starlite switch has multicast capability. Cells are duplicated by a copy network placed between inputs and the Batcher Banyan switch and multicast to the destination output ports (Fig.7). The Broadcast Packet Switch proposed by Turner <ref> [33, 3] </ref> is another example of multicast switches. Fig.19 shows the design of a Broadcast Packet Switch. This switch fabric composed of a series of major components: a Copy Network, Broadcast and Group Translators (BGT), a Distribution Network, and a Routing Network.

Reference-contexts: However, random selection of a cell may not always be the most desirable policy. For instance, if real-time cells and non-real-time cells contend for the same output, selecting one of the real-time cells may be more desirable. Eng [8] and Chen et al. <ref> [4] </ref> investigated the priority selection policy. Another possible selection policy is to choose a cell from the input buffer which has the longest queue [15]. In this subsection, we discuss these alternative selection policies. <p> Cells which failed at the first retry are dropped, but the resulting cell loss is small, as we saw in the above paragraph. Chen et al. <ref> [4] </ref> proposed another type of a priority selection. They assumed two types of traffic, real time traffic and data traffic. When output contention occurs, priority is given to cells from real time traffic. <p> If cells from both real time traffic and data traffic exist in the same input buffer, cells from the real time traffic are sent first. Among the cells at the same priority level, FIFO is assumed at an input buffer. Chen et al <ref> [4] </ref> assumed a nonblocking switch with the speedup ratio of 1 (L = 1) and analyzed the per formance of the switch assuming the priority selection policy described above. Uniform traffic is assumed in the analysis. They obtained the maximum throughput, the cell loss probability and the average delay time. <p> Oie et al. / Survey of Switching Techniques 29 Contention Resolution Buffering Size Performance Ref. selection speed losers winners random 1 input (FIFO) no queue N 0.586 [15] longest queue 1 input (FIFO) no queue N &gt; 0:586 (fl) [10] priority 1 input (priority) no queue N 0.606 <ref> [4] </ref> random 1 dropped no queue N 0.632 [26] random 1 dropped output 100N 0:85 (flfl) [10] random 1 input (window) no queue N 0.88 [12, 20, 10] random 1 shared no queue 6N fl [7, 10] random 3 input (FIFO) output N fl [24] priority 4 shared output 2N fl

Reference-contexts: Note that the blocking due to output contention may also occur in blocking switches. Examples of blocking switches include the Banyan switch and the buffered Banyan switch [14, 16]. The crossbar switch <ref> [5] </ref> and the Batcher Banyan switch [11] are examples of nonblocking switches. A large number of techniques have also been proposed to improve the performance of blocking and non-blocking switches.

Reference-contexts: older cells, and thus, cells may be delivered out of sequence. (Note that the out of sequence problem does not arise in the three-phase algorithm, since cells within an input buffer are sent on an FIFO basis.) The performance of the Starlite switch with trap [11] has been analyzed in <ref> [7, 10] </ref>. In the following, we assume an N fi N Starlite switch with trap with a shared buffer of capacity N fi B (cells). B could be interpreted as the capacity of the shared buffer per input (or per output). <p> The model used to analyze the performance of the Starlite switch with trap (i.e., the nonblocking switch with a shared buffer) is depicted in Fig.14. Eckberg et al. <ref> [7] </ref> studied the Starlite switch with trap and developed an approximate analysis to obtain the cell loss probability at a shared buffer, assuming that the queue length in the shared buffer follows a Gamma distribution. <p> They showed that the lower bound f (p) on the buffer size required to satisfy a given cell loss requirement is given by the average queue length in the M/D/1 system, confirming the results obtained in <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: One disadvantage to this design, however, is the fact that it uses the maximum number of crosspoints (cross-point switches) needed to implement an N fi N switch. The Knockout Switch is a nonblocking switch based on the crossbar design <ref> [8, 36] </ref>. It has N inputs and N outputs and consists of a crossbar type (crossbarlike) switch with a bus interface module at each output Oie et al. / Survey of Switching Techniques 8 Input Ports Output Ports Bus Interfaces 1 2 N 2 Fig.4 Knockout switch (Fig.4). <p> 1 0 1 p (loss) on inputs Yeh [36] 1 0 &lt; 1 p (loss) on outputs Oie [24, 25] 1 1 1 maximum throughput (see Tab.3) upper bound on p (loss) on inputs 1 1 &lt; 1 p (loss) on outputs 1 1 1 p (loss) on inputs Eng <ref> [8] </ref> NQ : Queueing does not occur. &lt; 1 : finite value 1 : both finite and infinite values Tab.2 Past research on the effects of speedup on the performance of a nonblocking switch Output buffers N fi N Input Ports Output Ports Fig.9 Nonblocking switch with output buffers Oie et <p> The performance of switches when the speedup ratio is less than N has been analyzed in <ref> [36, 24, 25, 8] </ref>. Yeh et al. [36] and Oie et al. [24, 25] analyzed the cell loss probability on input buffers, assuming infinite capacity buffers on the outputs (B output = 1). <p> For the smaller speedup factors of L = 3 and L = 4, the buffer capacity required is 50 and 54, respectively, to satisfy the same cell loss requirement. There is not a very large difference among the values of the required buffer capacity for different speedup factors. Eng <ref> [8] </ref> introduced 2-level priority classes among cells and analyzed the cell loss probability, assuming a single buffer at the input ports (i.e., B input = 1). <p> In all of the performance studies mentioned so far in this paper (except in <ref> [8] </ref>), it is assumed that one cell is randomly selected for transmission. However, random selection of a cell may not always be the most desirable policy. For instance, if real-time cells and non-real-time cells contend for the same output, selecting one of the real-time cells may be more desirable. Eng [8] <p> <ref> [8] </ref>), it is assumed that one cell is randomly selected for transmission. However, random selection of a cell may not always be the most desirable policy. For instance, if real-time cells and non-real-time cells contend for the same output, selecting one of the real-time cells may be more desirable. Eng [8] and Chen et al. [4] investigated the priority selection policy. Another possible selection policy is to choose a cell from the input buffer which has the longest queue [15]. In this subsection, we discuss these alternative selection policies. <p> Another possible selection policy is to choose a cell from the input buffer which has the longest queue [15]. In this subsection, we discuss these alternative selection policies. As we briefly discussed in subsection 4.4, Eng proposed a priority selection in the (photonic) Knockout switch <ref> [8] </ref>. In his scheme, 2 priority levels are assumed; new cells are given the lower priority, and previously blocked cells are given the higher priority. When an output contention occurs, a cell from the higher priority class is selected and transferred to the destination output. <p> Eng showed that Knockout switch with priority selection can achieve a cell loss probability of less than 10 6 , when the input traffic load is 0.9 and the speedup ratio of a switch fabric is 4 (i.e., p = 0:9 and L = 4) <ref> [8] </ref>. On the contrary, under the same set of parameter values, a buffer for 4 cells is required at each input to satisfy the same cell loss requirement, if we assume a random selection in the Knockout switch (as shown in Fig.11).

Reference-contexts: Lastly, we note that parallel buffers at the inputs can implement the window selection discipline at the expense of additional control hardware. Fitzpatrick et al. <ref> [9] </ref> proposed an N fiN switch where each input port has N buffers in parallel (Fig.13). Buffer i at an input port stores cells going to the output port i (1 i N ).

Reference-contexts: A switch only with output buffers are referred to as the output buffered switch [15, 31]. The performance of the output buffered switch has been investigated. The average delay is analyzed in [15] for infinite buffer case, and the cell loss probability at output buffers is obtained in <ref> [10] </ref> for finite buffer case.

Tab.4 shows the maximum throughput values of a nonblocking switch with the window selection discipline from [10]. <p> In <ref> [10] </ref>, Hluchyj et al. present simulation results on the maximum throughput of a nonblocking switch assuming the window selection discipline. Tab.4 shows the maximum throughput values of a nonblocking switch with the window selection discipline from [10]. This table shows that the window selection discipline is most effective when N is small and w is large. For instance, the maximum throughput is 0.96, very close to 1.0, when N = 2 and w = 8. <p> This throughput value is significantly higher than 0.586, the maximum throughput of the nonblocking switch with FIFO discipline. (See subsection 4.3.) However, it should be noted that this window selection discipline can not achieve the throughput of 1.0, even when N = 1 and w = 1 <ref> [10] </ref>. This is because that the window selection discipline limits each input to send at most one cell into the switch fabric per slot, and as a result, prevents the maximum throughput from reaching 1.0. <p> older cells, and thus, cells may be delivered out of sequence. (Note that the out of sequence problem does not arise in the three-phase algorithm, since cells within an input buffer are sent on an FIFO basis.) The performance of the Starlite switch with trap [11] has been analyzed in <ref> [7, 10] </ref>. In the following, we assume an N fi N Starlite switch with trap with a shared buffer of capacity N fi B (cells). B could be interpreted as the capacity of the shared buffer per input (or per output). <p> Furthermore, it is shown that, as N approaches infinity, the value of B (capacity of the shared buffer per output) required to satisfy a cell loss requirement of practical interests approaches its lower bound f (p) = 2 (1 p) As pointed out in <ref> [10] </ref>, this lower bound is same as the average queue length in the M/D/1 system. Hluchyj et al., in their study of the performance of the Starlite switch with trap [10], used the N fold convolution of an M/D/1 queue length to approximate the steady state distribution for the queue length <p> cell loss requirement of practical interests approaches its lower bound f (p) = 2 (1 p) As pointed out in <ref> [10] </ref>, this lower bound is same as the average queue length in the M/D/1 system.

Reference-contexts: Note that the blocking due to output contention may also occur in blocking switches. Examples of blocking switches include the Banyan switch and the buffered Banyan switch [14, 16]. The crossbar switch [5] and the Batcher Banyan switch <ref> [11] </ref> are examples of nonblocking switches. A large number of techniques have also been proposed to improve the performance of blocking and non-blocking switches. Performance improvement is gained by speeding up switching fabrics, reducing cell loss due to output contention, and/or constructing a switch fabric of multiple switch planes. <p> To guarantee that the cells will be in ascending order requires only that there be some type of sorting network preceding the Banyan switch. In the Starlite switch <ref> [11] </ref>, a Batcher network is used as the sorting network. This switch configuration is called the Batcher Banyan switch. The Batcher Banyan switch belongs to a major class of multi-stage interconnection networks, the class of nonblocking switches. <p> In the Batcher Banyan switch the incoming cells first enter a sorting network, which takes the cells and sorts them into ascending order according to their output addresses. In this way the cells can be sent to their destinations with no internal blocking. The design of a Starlite switch <ref> [11] </ref> is based upon the Batcher Banyan switch. <p> priority is not given to older cells, and thus, cells may be delivered out of sequence. (Note that the out of sequence problem does not arise in the three-phase algorithm, since cells within an input buffer are sent on an FIFO basis.) The performance of the Starlite switch with trap <ref> [11] </ref> has been analyzed in [7, 10]. In the following, we assume an N fi N Starlite switch with trap with a shared buffer of capacity N fi B (cells). B could be interpreted as the capacity of the shared buffer per input (or per output).

Reference-contexts: This is because a maximum of one cell per output port gets through the switch, and this throughput matches the speed of the output channel. An example of a control mechanism for nonblocking switches with FIFO input buffers is the three-phase algorithm proposed by Hui et al. <ref> [12] </ref>. This algorithm is used in conjunction with the Batcher Banyan switch to resolve output contention. In the first phase of the algorithm, an input port with cells to transmit sends a request cell with the source and the destination addresses in the cell header. <p> It is assumed in this subsection that, in case of output contention, one of the contending cells is randomly selected and sent to the output port (random selection policy). The performance of nonblocking switches with FIFO input buffers has been analyzed in <ref> [12, 15] </ref> under the assumptions described above. For the case of N = 1, Hui and Arthurs [12] showed that the maximum throughput of a switch is 0.586. <p> The performance of nonblocking switches with FIFO input buffers has been analyzed in [12, 15] under the assumptions described above.

They also obtained an upper bound on the cell loss probability at input buffers by truncating the queue length distribution for an infinite buffer size. <p> By observing the number of cells in an output Oie et al. / Survey of Switching Techniques 14 Analytic model for switch fabric Performance measures References L N B input B output obtained 1 1 1 NQ upper bound on p (loss) on inputs Hui <ref> [12] </ref> average delay Karol [15] 1 1 NQ maximum throughput (see Tab.1) N 1 NQ 1 average delay 1 NQ &lt; 1 p (loss) on outputs Hluchyj [10] 1 &lt; L &lt; N 1 0 1 p (loss) on inputs Yeh [36] 1 0 &lt; 1 p (loss) on outputs Oie <p> Hence, w is referred to as the window size.

Reference-contexts: However, blocking still occurs on the outputs to the switch, when more than one cell is destined for the same output. Note that the blocking due to output contention may also occur in blocking switches. Examples of blocking switches include the Banyan switch and the buffered Banyan switch <ref> [14, 16] </ref>. The crossbar switch [5] and the Batcher Banyan switch [11] are examples of nonblocking switches. A large number of techniques have also been proposed to improve the performance of blocking and non-blocking switches. <p> Thus, cell loss does not occur within this switch; it can only occur at the inputs to the switch. (With an infinite input buffer size, no cell loss occurs.) Jenq <ref> [14] </ref> analyzed a single-buffered binary Banyan switch (k = 2), where each input link of a switching element has a buffer size equal to one cell. <p> The HOL blocking will be discussed again in subsection 4.5 in more detail.

Reference-contexts: It is interesting to note that, in case of nonblocking switches, it has been shown that the maximum throughput decreases, as the size of switching elements increases <ref> [15] </ref>. For instance, a nonblocking switch constructed of 2 fi 2 switching elements achieves the maximum throughput of 0.75, while the switch constructed of 4 fi 4 switching elements results in smaller throughput of 0.68. The performance of the buffered Banyan switch under non-uniform traffic has been analyized. <p> It is assumed in this subsection that, in case of output contention, one of the contending cells is randomly selected and sent to the output port (random selection policy). The performance of nonblocking switches with FIFO input buffers has been analyzed in <ref> [12, 15] </ref> under the assumptions described above. For the case of N = 1, Hui and Arthurs [12] showed that the maximum throughput of a switch is 0.586. <p> Karol et al. <ref> [15] </ref> have obtained the maximum throughput of the switch for both finite N and infinite N , as well as the average delay time for infinite N . Tab.1 is from [15] and shows how the maximum throughput decreases as the number of inputs N increases. <p> Karol et al. <ref> [15] </ref> have obtained the maximum throughput of the switch for both finite N and infinite N , as well as the average delay time for infinite N . Tab.1 is from [15] and shows how the maximum throughput decreases as the number of inputs N increases. It is seen that, as N increases, the maximum throughput decreases to 0.586. <p> Queueing of cells occurs only on the outputs (Fig.9). A switch only with output buffers are referred to as the output buffered switch <ref> [15, 31] </ref>. The performance of the output buffered switch has been investigated.

Different names have been used for this service discipline in different papers. For instance, it is called priority scheme in [12], and window policy in <ref> [15] </ref>. In [3], bypass queueing discipline is used to describe the window selection discipline in the context of blocking switches. In this paper, we use window selection discipline. <p> Eng [8] and Chen et al. [4] investigated the priority selection policy. Another possible selection policy is to choose a cell from the input buffer which has the longest queue <ref> [15] </ref>. In this subsection, we discuss these alternative selection policies. As we briefly discussed in subsection 4.4, Eng proposed a priority selection in the (photonic) Knockout switch [8]. <p> This throughput value is larger than 0.586, the maximum throughput of the nonblocking switch with FIFO input buffers when priority selection is not assumed. In <ref> [15] </ref>, the longest queue selection policy was introduced.

Simulation results show that this policy offers smaller delay time than with the random selection policy [15]. 4.8 <p> In <ref> [15] </ref>, the longest queue selection policy was introduced.

Reference-contexts: However, blocking still occurs on the outputs to the switch, when more than one cell is destined for the same output. Note that the blocking due to output contention may also occur in blocking switches. Examples of blocking switches include the Banyan switch and the buffered Banyan switch <ref> [14, 16] </ref>. The crossbar switch [5] and the Batcher Banyan switch [11] are examples of nonblocking switches. A large number of techniques have also been proposed to improve the performance of blocking and non-blocking switches. <p> One approach to improve this limited throughput is to use input link buffers of larger capacity.

They assumed that cells in an input link buffer are served on an FIFO basis. <p> The HOL blocking will be discussed again in subsection 4.5 in more detail.

Kim et al. <ref> [16] </ref> showed that, if all the inputs to the switch are of a point-to-point connection type, single-buffered and multiple-buffered Banyan switches result in almost the same throughput.

Reference-contexts: It is this internal blocking which causes the degradation in the performance of the Banyan switch. Kruskal et al. investigated the effects of the internal blocking on the performance of the Banyan switch <ref> [17] </ref>. They developed approximate analysis for the Banyan switch assuming that switching elements do not have buffers and that the traffic is uniform. They obtained the probability that cells successfully reaches their destination output ports. <p> This architecture is called the d-replicated switch. These two switch configurations provide d multiple paths between any input and output port pairs, and thus reduce the probability of the internal blocking. These multipath Banyan switches have been analyzed in <ref> [17, 32] </ref>, assuming that switching elements do not have any buffers. For the d dilated Banyan switch, it was shown that the cell loss probability decreases when the dilation d increases [17, 32]. <p> These multipath Banyan switches have been analyzed in <ref> [17, 32] </ref>, assuming that switching elements do not have any buffers. For the d dilated Banyan switch, it was shown that the cell loss probability decreases when the dilation d increases [17, 32]. Dilation of between 4 and 8 is shown to be sufficient enough to reduce the cell loss probability to a very small value. <p> The d-replicated switch was shown to provide a similar performance to that of a d-dilated switch <ref> [17] </ref>. Adding a supplementary switch plane to the Banyan switch can also provide multiple paths between input and output port pairs. Anido et al. [1] considered a multipath switch constructed from two Banyan switches: one act as a routing network, while the other acts as a switching network.

Reference-contexts: This architecture is called the d-replicated switch. These two switch configurations provide d multiple paths between any input and output port pairs, and thus reduce the probability of the internal blocking. These multipath Banyan switches have been analyzed in <ref> [17, 32] </ref>, assuming that switching elements do not have any buffers. For the d dilated Banyan switch, it was shown that the cell loss probability decreases when the dilation d increases [17, 32]. <p> These multipath Banyan switches have been analyzed in <ref> [17, 32] </ref>, assuming that switching elements do not have any buffers. For the d dilated Banyan switch, it was shown that the cell loss probability decreases when the dilation d increases [17, 32]. Dilation of between 4 and 8 is shown to be sufficient enough to reduce the cell loss probability to a very small value. <p> The HOL blocking will be discussed again in subsection 4.5 in more detail. In the two papers discussed above [14, 16], the buffered Banyan switch is constructed of binary switching elements. In <ref> [3, 32] </ref>, it was shown that the buffered Banyan switch constructed of switching elements of size greater than two results in a higher throughput.

Reference-contexts: The parallel switch uses, not just one, but some number of switch planes and achieves better performance than the single plane switch. It can be easily seen that using two nonblocking switch planes together will achieve a maximum throughput of 1.0. Several papers <ref> [33, 13, 22] </ref> investigate a switch fabric consisting of multiple switch planes in parallel. Beside the obvious advantage of increased reliability, this switch architecture has the following advantages [13]. <p> As we saw in subsection 4.1.2, the Starlite switch has multicast capability. Cells are duplicated by a copy network placed between inputs and the Batcher Banyan switch and multicast to the destination output ports (Fig.7). The Broadcast Packet Switch proposed by Turner <ref> [33, 3] </ref> is another example of multicast switches. Fig.19 shows the design of a Broadcast Packet Switch. This switch fabric composed of a series of major components: a Copy Network, Broadcast and Group Translators (BGT), a Distribution Network, and a Routing Network.

Reference-contexts: For instance, a nonblocking switch constructed of 2 fi 2 switching elements achieves the maximum throughput of 0.75, while the switch constructed of 4 fi 4 switching elements results in smaller throughput of 0.68. The performance of the buffered Banyan switch under non-uniform traffic has been analyized. Wu <ref> [35] </ref> investigated the effects of existence of a point-to-point connection on the performance of the single-buffered Banyan switch through simulation. (Refer to section 2 for the definition of a point-to-point connection.) Wu showed that the maximum throughput of the buffered Banyan switch decreases significantly, when there exists a point-to-point connection in <p> On the contrary, it is shown in <ref> [35] </ref> that the degradation in the performance of the Banyan switch due to a point-to-point connection is significant.

Reference-contexts: One disadvantage to this design, however, is the fact that it uses the maximum number of crosspoints (cross-point switches) needed to implement an N fi N switch. The Knockout Switch is a nonblocking switch based on the crossbar design <ref> [8, 36] </ref>. It has N inputs and N outputs and consists of a crossbar type (crossbarlike) switch with a bus interface module at each output Oie et al. / Survey of Switching Techniques 8 Input Ports Output Ports Bus Interfaces 1 2 N 2 Fig.4 Knockout switch (Fig.4). <p> This switching speed of cells may be realized by, for instance, the Batcher Banyan switch operating L times faster than the input/output channels. The Knockout switch with an N to L concentrator at each output port has the same switching speed <ref> [36] </ref>. The ATOM switch speeds up the cell switching speed by transmitting arriving bits in parallel through the switch [31].

Reference-contexts: Related Research on Nonblocking Switches In this section, we consider two research topics so far not addressed in this paper: performance analysis assuming non-uniform input traffic, nonblocking switches with parallel input buffers and parallel service, and multicast switches. 4.9.1 Performance Analysis of Nonblocking Switches Under Non-Uniform Traffic Yoon et al. <ref> [37] </ref> analyized the performance of the Knockout switch assuming the existence of a hot spot. (A hot spot refers to an output port where heavy concentration of cells is expected to happen.) In their model, a fraction h of the incoming cells go to a hot spot, and the rest of <p> On the other hand, as we saw in subsection 4.4, if the traffic is uniform, L = 8 is sufficient enough to achieve the same loss probability. We can see that existence of a hot spot significantly reduces the performance of a switch. In <ref> [37] </ref>, the performance of the Knockout switch is also analyzed assuming the existence of a point-to-point connection (different type of non-uniform traffic). Refer to section 2 for the definition of a point-to-point connection.
