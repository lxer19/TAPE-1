Reference-contexts: Scientists later discovered that the converse piezoelectric effect is also true: when electrical charges are applied to certain substances, mechanical deformations occur <ref> [1] </ref>. Today, engineers use piezoelectric actuators, or patches, on substances to control physical deformations by actively negating them with controlled charges from the patches. These patches prove to be useful in a wide variety of settings, from actively reducing interior noise in a car to controlling vibrations in a satellite.
