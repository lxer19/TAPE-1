Reference-contexts: Specifically, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing, to arbitrary precision, the number of coverings of a rectangular lattice in any dimension with any specified dimer density. More precisely, for a fixed dimension d, let G be the d-dimensional rectangular lattice <ref> [1; : : :; n] </ref> d (with periodic boundary conditions). We let f (G; s) denote the number of coverings of G by s dimers and n d 2s monomers. <p> Clearly, matchings of cardinality s correspond precisely to monomer-dimer arrangements in G with s dimers and 2 (m s) monomers. The classical monomer-dimer problem discussed in the previous two subsections is the special case in which G is the d-dimensional rectangular lattice <ref> [1; : : :; n] </ref> d for some d. Let us now associate with each matching M in G a weight w (M ) = jMj , where jM j denotes the cardinality of matching M and is a positive real number. <p> We will discuss this issue in more detail in section 2.4. Our main technical contribution is to prove that the ratio is small for lattices and, more generally, for arbitrary Cayley graphs. Specifically, we show that if G is the d-dimensional rectangular lattice <ref> [1; : : : ; n] </ref> d with periodic boundary conditions (so that m = 1 2 n d ), then ff (G) m 2 = 1 4 n 2d . <p> Thus, we consider the d-dimensional rectangular (or cartesian) lattice L (n; d) , where the vertices are the n d integer lattice points in <ref> [1; n] </ref> d , and two points x; y are connected by an edge iff they are unit distance apart. <p> This map extends to matchings in the natural way: if N is a matching, then t (N ) 2 [2; n 1 + 1] fi <ref> [1; n 2 ] </ref> is just: (t (x); t (y)) 2 t (N ) iff (x; y) 2 N . Let M and N be the sets of perfect and near-perfect matchings respectively in the lattice L (n; 2) .

Reference-contexts: This map extends to matchings in the natural way: if N is a matching, then t (N ) 2 <ref> [2; n 1 + 1] </ref> fi [1; n 2 ] is just: (t (x); t (y)) 2 t (N ) iff (x; y) 2 N . Let M and N be the sets of perfect and near-perfect matchings respectively in the lattice L (n; 2) . <p> Elementary considerations show that 2 (d; 2d 1) . For d = 2 , it has actually been proven that 2 (2:62; 2:70) <ref> [2, 10] </ref>. (See also [29] for similar bounds in higher dimensions.) However, these rigorous bounds are much weaker than the non-rigorous estimates obtained by empirical methods, which are typically quoted to four decimal places.

Reference-contexts: These are the first polynomial time algorithms where the statistical errors are rigorously controlled. Our algorithms are based on modifications and extensions of a Monte Carlo approach studied originally by Berretti and Sokal <ref> [3] </ref>. In the next subsection we sketch this approach and point out its limitations. <p> The above type of Markov chain was considered by Berretti and Sokal <ref> [3] </ref>, who used a single parameter fi 1 to control the relative probabilities of extending or contracting the walk by one edge. Given a walk of length i , one of the 2d lattice edges incident to the free endpoint of the walk is chosen with equal probability. <p> have been used to study self-avoiding walks (see Chapter 9 of [48] for a summary), all of these suffer from a similar lack of rigorous justification, and thus offer no guarantee that their results are reliable. fl Actually, these transition probabilities are a slightly simplified version of those used in <ref> [3] </ref>, but this difference is inessential to the behavior of the chain. 37 3.1.3 Our results We develop a Monte Carlo algorithm for self-avoiding walks by modifying the Markov chain used by Berretti and Sokal so as to overcome the difficulties discussed in the last subsection. <p> In the case that fi 1 = ::: = fi n 1 this is just the Markov chain used by Berretti and Sokal <ref> [3] </ref>, but truncated at level n. It is evident that the Markov chain M n is irreducible (all states communicate) and aperiodic. This implies that it is ergodic, i.e., it converges asymptotically to a well-defined stationary distribution n over X n . <p> This might be far more efficient than basing the number of simulation steps on some proven, but potentially loose, upper bound g (n) . The idea of a tester has been used before, but in a much more restrictive sense. For example, Berretti and Sokal <ref> [3] </ref> propose testing possible "errors in scaling" due to the conjecture that f (n) An fl1 by trying other specific polynomial forms for f (n) . This gives evidence that f (n) might be of the correct form, but falls short of proving it probabilistically.

Reference-contexts: Hammersley [22] proved the lower bound 0:418347 , while the early paper by Fowler and Rushbrooke [17] showed the upper bound 0:54931. It has been conjectured that lies between 0:43 and 0:45 . In other work, Bhattacharjee et al <ref> [4] </ref> studied the phase transition behavior of the three-dimensional model. However, no reliable method is known for computing f (n) to good accuracy. A similar lack of rigorous results holds for the problem at dimer densities less than 1, even in two dimensions.

Reference-contexts: These results are based on an approximation algorithm due to Jerrum and Sinclair [34] and Broder <ref> [7] </ref>. In each of these cases we also present an almost uniform generator for the corresponding sampling problems. This chapter is based on work with Claire Kenyon and Alistair Sinclair [43]. In chapter 3 we address the problem of counting self-avoiding walks in lattices. <p> This includes other commonly studied lattices such as the hexagonal lattice with periodic boundary conditions. y 2.1.3 Overview of the algorithm The algorithms mentioned above are all based on a Monte Carlo procedure due to Jerrum and Sinclair [34] and Broder <ref> [7] </ref>, for approximating the number of matchings in a graph. A matching in a 2m -vertex graph G = (V; E) is any subset M of the edge set E such that no two edges in M have a common endpoint.

Reference-contexts: Example 1: The Ising Model The Ising model was introduced in the 1920's to study ferromagnetism and is one of the most famous models from statistical mechanics (see, e.g., <ref> [8] </ref> for a history and review). The system is modeled by a finite lattice where the vertices represent atoms of a ferromagnetic 7 material. <p> An important example is the partial derivative with respect to temperature. Discontinuities in this derivative identify phase transitions. In the ferromagnetic interpretation of the Ising model, such a phase transition corresponds to the point of spontaneous magnetization. Other examples of phase transitions are melting and boiling (see <ref> [8] </ref>). In our discussions so far we have restricted our attention to idealized finite systems where the particles coincide with lattice sites. In fact, these discrete models are really computational tools for studying the continuous analogues of the partition function and free energy on infinite lattices.

Reference-contexts: The two-dimensional monomer-dimer problem serves as a model for the adsorption of diatomic molecules onto a crystal surface, where monomers correspond to empty sites [56]. The three-dimensional problem occurs classically in the theory of mixtures of molecules of different sizes [20] and the cell-cluster theory of the liquid state <ref> [9] </ref>. Consider a monomer-dimer arrangement consisting of s dimers and ^ N 2s monomers on a lattice with ^ N vertices. The energy is sJ , where J is the energy derived from covering any particular edge with a dimer.

Reference-contexts: Elementary considerations show that 2 (d; 2d 1) . For d = 2 , it has actually been proven that 2 (2:62; 2:70) <ref> [2, 10] </ref>. (See also [29] for similar bounds in higher dimensions.) However, these rigorous bounds are much weaker than the non-rigorous estimates obtained by empirical methods, which are typically quoted to four decimal places. <p> There has already been substantial effort in the physics community to count the number of self-avoiding walks exactly, especially in two dimensions. Using various ingenious (although exponential-time) algorithms the number of self-avoiding walks on the 2-dimensional lattice is now known to length 50 <ref> [10] </ref>. We include the published results up to length 39 for comparison with our estimates [48, 10]. <p> Using various ingenious (although exponential-time) algorithms the number of self-avoiding walks on the 2-dimensional lattice is now known to length 50 [10]. We include the published results up to length 39 for comparison with our estimates <ref> [48, 10] </ref>. In three dimensions, where there are far more self-avoiding walks than in two dimensions, exact enumerations have been less successful; the exact number of walks in the 3-dimensional cartesian lattice have only been computed to length 21 [48].

Reference-contexts: This intuition can be formalized and a bound obtained on the mixing time in terms of the quantity = min (), using a measure known as conductance [60]. However, we can get a slightly sharper bound in this case by following an idea of Diaconis and Stroock <ref> [12] </ref> and using the alternative measure = min ()`(), where `() is the maximum length of a path in .

Reference-contexts: The first is a standard trick for reducing the number of samples required to get a good estimate of the product of random variables (see, e.g., <ref> [13] </ref>). Rather than requiring that the variance of all n random variables be extremely small (so that the product will be close to its mean), we bound the variance of the product directly.

Reference-contexts: In contrast to the rectangular lattice, the assumption of periodic boundary conditions is important here: Elser <ref> [14] </ref> has solved the dimer covering problem on a hexagonal lattice with fixed boundaries, and shown that the result depends significantly on the shape of the boundary. 21 has at most jEj neighbors, where jEj is the number of edges in G .

Reference-contexts: The monomer-dimer problem gained prominence in 1937 through the early paper of Fowler and Rushbrooke [17]. A breakthrough was achieved in 1961, when, independently, Fisher, Kasteleyn and Temperley provided an analytic solution for the case of dimer coverings (i.e., arrangements with dimer density 1) on a two-dimensional rectangular lattice <ref> [15, 40, 63] </ref>. The key idea is to express the number of dimer coverings as a Pfaffian, which in turn can be evaluated as the square root of an associated determinant.

Reference-contexts: We conjecture that this technique may shed more light on other quantities related to monomer-dimer systems, and in particular the correlation between monomers at two specified sites, as studied in two dimensions by Fisher and Stephenson <ref> [16] </ref>. The remainder of the chapter is organized as follows. In the next section, we prove bounds of the above form for rectangular lattices with periodic boundary conditions in any dimension, and with fixed boundaries in two dimensions. In section 2.3 we extend our technique to handle arbitrary Cayley graphs. <p> In physical terms, this corresponds to the correlation between a pair of monomers in a sea of dimers, a quantity for which partial results were obtained in two dimensions by Fisher and Stephenson <ref> [16] </ref>. Our techniques immediately yield a simple and rigorous proof that, in any dimension d , the number of configurations with two monomers at any fixed pair of vertices u; v is bounded by n d times the number of configurations with two adjacent monomers.

Reference-contexts: Note that this is exactly the framework for the class NP; while NP is the set of problems for which the non-deterministic machine decides whether an accepting computation exists, # P is the class of problems for which the non-deterministic machine counts how many accepting configurations exist (see <ref> [18] </ref> for a survey). Each of the computational problems from the previous section can be expressed as a general graph theoretic problem. For instance, the problem # MATCHING (G; i ) takes as input a graph G and an integer i and asks how many matchings of size i exist.

Reference-contexts: A similar bound holds for arbitrary Cayley graphs. We stress that our Monte Carlo algorithm differs from earlier ones for monomer-dimer systems (see, e.g., <ref> [23] </ref>) in that it is guaranteed (independent of any heuristic arguments) to provide statistically reliable estimates in a running time that grows only polynomially with the number of lattice sites.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the techniques rely critically on planarity and do not appear to generalize to higher dimensional lattices. The first formalization of this limitation came when Hammersley et al. <ref> [25] </ref> proved that there cannot be a straightforward way of extending the above approach to even three-dimensional lattices. 1.2.2 Hardness Computational complexity theory offers further evidence for the apparent hardness of these problems. In 1979, Valiant defined the class # P to classify counting problems [64].

Reference-contexts: Thus although the algorithmic results we present will be stated for arbitrary dimensions d, they are of greatest interest in the case of low-dimensional lattices with 2 d 4 . One key fact that holds in all dimensions was discovered in 1954 by Hammersley and Morton <ref> [27] </ref>; they observed that lim n!1 c 1=n n = exists, and that n c n = n f (n) , where lim n!1 f (n) 1=n = 1.

Reference-contexts: This is a straightforward consequence of the obvious fact that 35 the sequence ` n = log c n is subadditive, i.e., ` n+m ` n + ` m for all n; m.

Reference-contexts: The generally accepted formalization of the notion of efficiency is a polynomial-time algorithm. Such an algorithm takes as input a natural description of the problem instance and must compute an output in time which is bounded by some fixed polynomial in the size of the input description (see, e.g., <ref> [31] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: This helps explain why Fisher, Kasteleyn and Temperley's algorithm fails to generalize to all non-planar graphs. Furthermore, Jerrum showed that counting the total number of matchings (of all sizes) in a graph is #P-complete, even when the graph is planar <ref> [32] </ref>. This gives evidence for why the Fisher, Kasteleyn, Temperley algorithm does not easily generalize to counting matchings of arbitrary size.

Reference-contexts: This is called rapid mixing and can be characterized by the expansion properties or conductance of the graph underlying the Markov chain <ref> [59, 34] </ref>. We will explain this connection in greater detail in section 3.2.2. 1.4 Summary The remainder of this thesis is divided into two chapters. The first chapter addresses the monomer-dimer problem. <p> This gives an approximation algorithm which solves the monomer-dimer problem in exactly the two cases where the Fisher, Kasteleyn, Temperley algorithm fails: namely, counting matchings of arbitrary size, and counting matchings on non-planar lattices. These results are based on an approximation algorithm due to Jerrum and Sinclair <ref> [34] </ref> and Broder [7]. In each of these cases we also present an almost uniform generator for the corresponding sampling problems. This chapter is based on work with Claire Kenyon and Alistair Sinclair [43]. In chapter 3 we address the problem of counting self-avoiding walks in lattices. <p> This includes other commonly studied lattices such as the hexagonal lattice with periodic boundary conditions. y 2.1.3 Overview of the algorithm The algorithms mentioned above are all based on a Monte Carlo procedure due to Jerrum and Sinclair <ref> [34] </ref> and Broder [7], for approximating the number of matchings in a graph. A matching in a 2m -vertex graph G = (V; E) is any subset M of the edge set E such that no two edges in M have a common endpoint. <p> Thus, in the monomer-dimer problem on G , we are trying to compute the coefficients a s for various values of s . The Monte Carlo method described in <ref> [34] </ref> simulates a Metropolis-style Markov chain whose state space is the set of matchings in G (see section 1.3.1). <p> If our estimates are sufficiently good, then appropriate products of these estimates would yield an estimate for each of the coefficients a i . For the details of the algorithm, see <ref> [34] </ref>. The dominant factor in the running time of this algorithm is the number of steps that need to be simulated in order for the Markov chain to reach equilibrium for the values of needed in the above experiments. This quantity is analyzed rigorously in [34] and shown to be a <p> details of the algorithm, see <ref> [34] </ref>. The dominant factor in the running time of this algorithm is the number of steps that need to be simulated in order for the Markov chain to reach equilibrium for the values of needed in the above experiments. This quantity is analyzed rigorously in [34] and shown to be a polynomial function of the ratio ff (G) = a m1 =a m , specifically O (ff (G) 4 jEj 2 ) . (This has since been improved to O (ff (G) 2 jV jjEj) ; see [58].) The Monte Carlo procedure will therefore be efficient <p> The ratio ff (G) measures the amount by which the number of near-perfect matchings in G exceeds the number of perfect matchings. z The transition probabilities of the actual Markov chain described in <ref> [34] </ref> are a slight variant of these where we allow self-loops at each state to ensure aperiodicity. x In [34, 59] it is shown that the same approach yields a fpras for the partition function Z | though not for all its coefficients | in an arbitrary graph, regardless of the <p> ff (G) measures the amount by which the number of near-perfect matchings in G exceeds the number of perfect matchings. z The transition probabilities of the actual Markov chain described in [34] are a slight variant of these where we allow self-loops at each state to ensure aperiodicity. x In <ref> [34, 59] </ref> it is shown that the same approach yields a fpras for the partition function Z | though not for all its coefficients | in an arbitrary graph, regardless of the value of ff (G) . <p> We now state this result precisely. Recall that, for a 2m -vertex graph G , the quantity ff (G) = jN j=jMj is defined to be the ratio of the number of near-perfect matchings to the number of perfect matchings in G . Theorem 2.2.1 (Jerrum and Sinclair <ref> [34, Theorem 5.3] </ref>) There exists a fpras for the number of perfect matchings in any family of 2m -vertex graphs G that satisfies ff (G) q (m) , for a fixed polynomial q . <p> Theorem 2.2.1 (Jerrum and Sinclair [34, Theorem 5.3]) There exists a fpras for the number of perfect matchings in any family of 2m -vertex graphs G that satisfies ff (G) q (m) , for a fixed polynomial q . The remark following this result in <ref> [34] </ref> points out that this polynomial relationship between the numbers of near-perfect and perfect matchings also allows one to construct a fpras for counting matchings of arbitrary cardinality in G . <p> On the other hand, ff is known to be polynomially bounded for all sufficiently dense graphs, all graphs with sufficiently good "expansion" properties, and almost every random graph in a suitable model <ref> [34] </ref>. Interestingly, the technique used to prove this property in all these cases is not applicable to lattices since it involves constructing short augmenting paths for near-perfect matchings; such paths do not exist in lattice graphs, which have large diameter. <p> In recent years several useful analytical tools have been devised for analyzing the mixing time of complex Markov chains of this kind. We make use of the idea of "canonical paths", first developed in <ref> [34, 59] </ref>. Consider an ergodic, reversible Markov chain with state space X , transition probabilities P and stationary distribution .

Reference-contexts: Sampling allows us to examine "typical" configurations of the system. Moreover, it has been recognized that for large classes of combinatorial problems the counting and sampling problems are closely related <ref> [36] </ref>. For 10 each of the problems we consider we will be addressing both of these questions. 1.1.2 Free energy As indicated earlier, the partition function Z is the key to relating the microscopic and macroscopic levels of description of a physical system. <p> In fact, sampling uniformly turns out to be a useful tool for approximate counting as well. More formally, we will be interested in designing algorithms which meet the following specifications. These are the standard definitions of approximation algorithms for counting and sampling (see, for example, <ref> [39, 36, 59] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The monomer-dimer problem gained prominence in 1937 through the early paper of Fowler and Rushbrooke [17]. A breakthrough was achieved in 1961, when, independently, Fisher, Kasteleyn and Temperley provided an analytic solution for the case of dimer coverings (i.e., arrangements with dimer density 1) on a two-dimensional rectangular lattice <ref> [15, 40, 63] </ref>. The key idea is to express the number of dimer coverings as a Pfaffian, which in turn can be evaluated as the square root of an associated determinant.

Reference-contexts: The dilute solution enables one to study a single polymer without worrying about further restrictions caused by interactions with other polymer chains (see <ref> [48] </ref> for a survey). The more general class of lattice animals arises similarly in the study of branched polymers in dilute solution. As we have already stated, for each of these physical systems, a primary objective is to calculate the partition function. <p> precise statements about this correlation. 34 Chapter 3 Self-avoiding walks 3.1 Introduction 3.1.1 Background Self-avoiding walks in Z d have been studied by mathematicians and natural scientists for many years and are the subject of an extensive literature; for a state-of-the-art survey, see the recent book of Madras and Slade <ref> [48] </ref>. (See also the book by Lawler [45] for related topics.) One of the most important applications is as a model for the spatial arrangement of linear polymer molecules in chemical physics. <p> precise conjectured values for the critical exponent fl in two and three dimensions (despite the fact that fl is not known to exist): for d = 2 , fl is believed to be 43 32 , and for d = 3 it is believed to be approximately 1:16 . (See <ref> [48] </ref> for a detailed summary of numerical estimates.) Much effort has been invested in obtaining statistical estimates of the above quantities using Monte Carlo simulations. However, the error bars on these estimates are only justified heuristically. In this chapter, we attempt to put such experiments on a firmer footing. <p> This leads to circularity, since determining is one of the principal goals of the algorithm. While many similar Monte Carlo algorithms have been used to study self-avoiding walks (see Chapter 9 of <ref> [48] </ref> for a summary), all of these suffer from a similar lack of rigorous justification, and thus offer no guarantee that their results are reliable. fl Actually, these transition probabilities are a slightly simplified version of those used in [3], but this difference is inessential to the behavior of the chain. <p> Using various ingenious (although exponential-time) algorithms the number of self-avoiding walks on the 2-dimensional lattice is now known to length 50 [10]. We include the published results up to length 39 for comparison with our estimates <ref> [48, 10] </ref>. In three dimensions, where there are far more self-avoiding walks than in two dimensions, exact enumerations have been less successful; the exact number of walks in the 3-dimensional cartesian lattice have only been computed to length 21 [48]. <p> In three dimensions, where there are far more self-avoiding walks than in two dimensions, exact enumerations have been less successful; the exact number of walks in the 3-dimensional cartesian lattice have only been computed to length 21 <ref> [48] </ref>. In contrast, notice that our algorithm actually performs better in higher dimensions (assuming conjecture 1 which suggests that the factor ff 1 is expected to decrease as the dimension increases). Consequently, we have concentrated our efforts on the 3-dimensional lattice which has the greatest physical significance.

Reference-contexts: In particular, self-avoiding walks on the cartesian lattice appear to have a quite different set of constraints from polymers, whose bond angles are rarely rectilinear. In fact the bond angles are typically tetrahedral and do not align with any regular lattice <ref> [61] </ref>. The justification for using self-avoiding walks to model polymers, and for the other combinatorial idealizations employed in the field, comes from the empirical existence of universality classes. Several of the parameters studied in the thermodynamic limit appear to be dimension dependent, but lattice independent.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, again assuming conjecture 1, Sokal and Thomas <ref> [62] </ref> argue that with such values of fi the Markov chain is rapidly mixing, i.e., it gets very close to stationarity after a number of steps that is only polynomial in n (see also [46]). <p> Since e was arbitrary, (3.4) now gives us the required upper bound on (). Remark. A similar bound on the mixing time of the Berretti-Sokal Markov chain was obtained using ad-hoc methods by Sokal and Thomas <ref> [62] </ref>. Again the essential feature that makes the argument work is the sub-Cayley property of the tree underlying the chain. A rather weaker bound was obtained by Lawler and Sokal [46], using the discrete Cheeger inequality or conductance.

Reference-contexts: A breakthrough in the design of efficient algorithms in statistical mechanics was achieved in 1961 when Fisher, Kasteleyn and Temperley independently discovered a polynomial-time algorithm for a special case of the monomer-dimer problem known as the dimer problem <ref> [15,40, 63] </ref> (see section 2.1). <p> The monomer-dimer problem gained prominence in 1937 through the early paper of Fowler and Rushbrooke [17]. A breakthrough was achieved in 1961, when, independently, Fisher, Kasteleyn and Temperley provided an analytic solution for the case of dimer coverings (i.e., arrangements with dimer density 1) on a two-dimensional rectangular lattice <ref> [15, 40, 63] </ref>. The key idea is to express the number of dimer coverings as a Pfaffian, which in turn can be evaluated as the square root of an associated determinant.

Reference-contexts: In 1979, Valiant defined the class # P to classify counting problems <ref> [64] </ref>. <p> Valiant showed that # MATCHING (G; ^ N=2) , the problem of counting perfect match 14 ings in a graph with ^ N vertices, is # P-complete <ref> [64] </ref>. This helps explain why Fisher, Kasteleyn and Temperley's algorithm fails to generalize to all non-planar graphs. Furthermore, Jerrum showed that counting the total number of matchings (of all sizes) in a graph is #P-complete, even when the graph is planar [32]. <p> This is noteworthy when coupled with the following theorem. Theorem 2.3.3 Counting the number of perfect matchings in a bipartite neighbor-automorphism graph is # P-complete. The proof uses a reduction from counting perfect matchings in an arbitrary bipartite graph; this was also shown by Valiant to be # P-complete <ref> [64] </ref>. Briefly, the idea behind the reduction is as follows. Let G = (V 1 ; V 2 ; E) be an arbitrary bipartite graph. <p> This is a widely studied problem in combinatorics for which the existence of an efficient approximation algorithm is an important open question in the theory of computation <ref> [64] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, this approach no longer runs in polynomial time if c is allowed to grow with n, and is inefficient even for quite small fixed values of c . y An analytic solution to the dimer covering problem for this planar lattice has been known for some time <ref> [65, 41] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We are interested in counting the number of monomer-dimer arrangements with any fixed density. In this section we present some of the highlights in the history of this problem.

An important subclass of animals are self-avoiding walks, or animals where each vertex has degree at most two. <p> A lattice tree is an acyclic lattice animal which is made up of n 1 lattice edges. Lattice trees model branched polymers in dilute solution and are believed to fall in the same universality class as lattice animals <ref> [67] </ref>. There is strong evidence that the expression for the number of lattice trees of size n has a similar form to conjecture 1. It is likely that the techniques used here to design a testable algorithm for self-avoiding walks can be extended to this wider class of lattice animals.
