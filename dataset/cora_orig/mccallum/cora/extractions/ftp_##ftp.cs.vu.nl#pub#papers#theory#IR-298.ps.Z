Abstract: We present a confluence criterion, local decreasingness, for abstract reduction systems. This criterion is shown to be a considerable generalisation of several well-known confluence criteria.

Reference-contexts: The notions for relations we will introduce are extended to ARSs by identifying an ARS A with its reduction relation ! A . Such notions obviously do not depend on the presentation of an ARS. For example, -calculus (see <ref> [Bar84] </ref>) can be presented as the ARS (fl; h fi; i ), i.e. objects are -terms and reduction relations are fi- and -reduction. <p> As a simple example of an application of the main theorem to a specific ARS, we show that fi- and -reductions commute for -calculus. By simple case analysis (see <ref> [Bar84] </ref>) one shows that the diagram in Figure 4 holds. Now one notes that fi has `splitting effect' on but not vice versa, so if we take fi, then the diagram is decreasing hence fi commutes with .

Reference-contexts: Klop [Klo92]) are in fact easy corollaries of this theorem.

Reference-contexts: A mediate consequence is the confluence of non-splitting and relatively terminating reduction systems, a result of Geser <ref> [Ges90] </ref>. Section 2 contains a short introduction to abstract reduction systems and multisets. In Section 3 we define the lexicographic maximum measure on reductions, and diagrams which are decreasing with respect to this measure. It is shown that these diagrams can be pasted together to form bigger decreasing diagrams. <p> The mirrored version of DB 2 is needed because of the condition ff fi on its hypothesis. 2 Next, we show a non-trivial application of the strong confluence theorem to obtain a recent result by Geser.

(1) The relation ! ff modulo ! fi is defined by ! ff=fi = def fi ; ! ff ; fi . <p> If ! ff=fi is terminating, then ! ff is said to be relatively terminating (with respect to ! fi ). (2) The relation ! fi , is non-splitting (NS), if fi ; ! A ! = A ; A (see Figures 8 and 9). Corollary 4.11 <ref> [Ges90] </ref> Let A = def (A; h ! ff ; ! fi i ) be an ARS.

Section 2 contains a short introduction to abstract reduction systems and multisets. <p> by another appeal to (the mirrored version of) Lemma 3.5. 2 Note The above proof can be made formal, by showing that the predicate P on divergences, defined by: P (b a c) = def 9d; b d c forming a decreasing diagram, is a mul -complete 5 predicate (see <ref> [Hue80] </ref>). A special case of the theorem arises when we take the sets I v and I h to be equal to the set of all labels I. In searching for applications of the theorem, the characterisation of locally decreasing diagrams (Proposition 3.4) is often helpful. <p> Definition 4.5 Strong confluence <ref> [Hue80] </ref> A relation ! is strongly confluent (SCR) if ; ! ! = ; (see Figure 6). Informally, the tiler can choose the side of the splitting. Although a direct proof that strong confluence implies confluence is easy, we want to reduce this problem to Theorem 3.7. <p> The solution is to note that splitting takes place only in the vertical reductions. Hence, we make a distinction between vertical and horizontal reductions, ordering the horizontal steps above the vertical ones. Corollary 4.6 Strong confluence lemma <ref> [Hue80] </ref> Let A = def (A; !) be an ARS. If A is strongly confluent, then A is confluent. 13 SCR =) vv h Proof Define the ARS B = def (A; h ! h ; ! v i ) by ! h = def ! v = def !.

Reference-contexts: We conclude in Section 5 with suggestions for further research. 2 Preliminaries In this section we give a short introduction to abstract reduction systems and multisets. For an overview of these subjects we refer to [Klo92] and <ref> [JL82] </ref>. An abstract reduction system is a set of objects A equipped with some binary `reduction' relations. Throughout this paper I denotes the set of labels (or names) of these relations. Labels will be denoted by ff, fi and fl. <p> Furthermore, we say that M `traces back' to N if M 4 mul N . This corresponds to the intuition that each element of M is dominated by some element of N , i.e. traces back to that element. It is well-known (cf. <ref> [JL82] </ref>) that the standard multiset extension of a strict partial order is again a strict partial order on the class of finite multisets. In the case of general multisets one can show that transitivity is preserved, but irreflexivity is not. <p> In words this reads, first compare the maximal elements of the multisets and only if this is not decisive apply the method recursively to its noise. This order is the same as the order M in <ref> [JL82] </ref>, where it is shown that it properly contains the standard multiset extension and inherits well-foundedness.

Reference-contexts: Decreasing diagrams then can be pasted to yield decreasing diagrams. The main theorem states that if the label order is well-founded and every local confluence diagram is decreasing, then confluence holds.

Section 2 contains a short introduction to abstract reduction systems and multisets. <p> The idea is that we have to choose a presentation such that reduction steps have no splitting effect on themselves. If the reduction relation is strongly normalising then the splitting behaviour does not matter, as stated by an early result of Newman. Corollary 4.4 Newman's lemma <ref> [New42] </ref> Let A = def (A; !) be an ARS. If A is locally confluent and strongly normalising, then A is confluent.

Reference-contexts: A confluence diagram is graded by its divergence and is said to be decreasing if the measures of the convergent reductions a b d and a c d are both less than or equal to the measure of the diagram. fl This paper is a completely revised version of <ref> [Oos91] </ref> and has been submitted to TCS for publication. 1 We define the measure of a reduction sequence to be the multiset of the lexicographically maximal step labels of the sequence (step labels not less than the label of an earlier step).
