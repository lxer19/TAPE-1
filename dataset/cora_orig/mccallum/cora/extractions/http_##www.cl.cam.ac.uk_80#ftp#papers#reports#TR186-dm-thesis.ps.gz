Reference-contexts: RPC has been used as an example of a distributed computing mechanism, but it is hoped that the general lessons concerning the use of the MSN architecture are also applicable to traditional networking, as well as different models of distributed computing (e.g. ISIS [Birman 87], Linda [Carriero 86], Mach <ref> [Accetta 86] </ref>). 6.2.1 Benefits of MSN Certain benefits accrue directly from using the MSN architecture as the underlying internetworking layer.

Reference-contexts: The move to distributed computing based on RPC does not replace the need for reliable bulk transport, and, as previously mentioned, underlying many RPC systems there is often a reliable transport mechanism; for example VMTP in the V-kernel [Cheriton 86] and REX in the ANSA testbench <ref> [ANSA 89] </ref>. Both these transport mechanisms, and others unrelated to RPC which have been investigated recently (e.g. NETBLT [Clark 87]), have been based on combinations of rate based flow control and selective retransmission. <p> Within the kernel the MSN architecture has been implemented as the sole communications architecture, and work is under way to implement the ANSA testbench <ref> [ANSA 89] </ref> in this environment.

For example, accurate error and utilization statistics, and support for dynamic reconfiguration of circuits. 8.1.3 Multicast Certain models of distributed computing (e.g. ISIS <ref> [Birman 87] </ref>), and video and voice conferencing, can benefit greatly from a multicast service.

Reference-contexts: These systems have not, in general, been extended into heterogeneous, or wide area networks, as they present network requirements which cannot be met by current interconnection architectures. For example, distributing computing mechanisms, such as remote procedure call (RPC) <ref> [Birrell 84] </ref>, are sensitive to long round trip delays, while real time traffic requires constraints on the variation in delay, or jitter. In an internetwork, the largest source of delay and jitter is often the internetwork switching nodes, or routers. <p> The aim is to utilize the underlying MSN architecture capabilities effectively, as well as obtain advantage from applying similar design techniques to the mechanisms present in these distributing computing components. The main distributed computing mechanism discussed is remote procedure call (RPC) <ref> [Birrell 84] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As with the OSI ISO model, the presentation layer of the RPC mechanism performs no multiplexing. Security A number of mechanisms for secure and authenticated RPC, based on both public and private key encryption schemes, are to be found in the literature <ref> [Birrell 85] </ref> [Birrell 87].

Reference-contexts: Packet based traffic can easily be conveyed over ATM networks by straightforward fragmentation of higher level protocol units into ATM cells. Such mechanisms have always been used in a number of networks, such as slotted rings (Cambridge ring [Wilkes 79]) or slotted bus systems (DQDB <ref> [Budrikis 86] </ref>). The implementation of the fragmentation and reassembly algorithm for ATM requires extra processing power at end points over that required for a PTM network. <p> Although ATM solves this problem, it is not the only solution. A number of attempts based on providing explicit isochronous channels to support voice and video have been investigated (e.g. FDDI-II [Ross 86], DQDB <ref> [Budrikis 86] </ref>). Unfortunately this approach does not represent an integrated solution, rather it provides time division multiplexing between an STM network and a PTM network, with the following effects: * fixed bandwidth allocation, * distinct channels, * restrictions on real time equipment. <p> Full details of the design and implementation of the Cambridge backbone network are to be found in [Greaves 89b]. 2.4.3 DQDB The distributed queuing dual bus (DQDB) network [IEEE 8026 89] (based on the earlier QPSX <ref> [Budrikis 86] </ref>), provides a hybrid approach to multi-service networks. <p> The solution adopted is to attach a quality of service implicitly to each MS-Access instance; this has the consequence that any underlying network which can support multiple qualities of service, such as DQDB <ref> [Budrikis 86] </ref>, must present itself as two logical MS-Access instances.

Reference-contexts: These services are used by portals to establish communication with peer portals at remote sites. These functions include services such as ISDN I-series signaling and dynamic bandwidth management by use of B-channel aggregation [Harita 89] <ref> [Burren 89] </ref>. The use of out of band techniques for management, allows the in-band ATM channel to be utilized effectively in a completely portal specific manner.

Reference-contexts: The mechanism of single cell forwarding, or cut-through, implemented by MSNL level can no longer be used, and even MAC layer bridges between DQDB networks are forced to implement store and forward. 7.4 XTP The Xpress transfer protocol (XTP) is an architecture designed with future high speed networks in mind <ref> [Chesson 89] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Synchronization for the intra-system multiplexing points is usually implemented in software, and a number of techniques can be considered when attempting to reduce the cost of this synchronization: * the use of formal methods may provide some illumination, and perhaps even some liveness guarantees, * the use of upcalls <ref> [Clark 85] </ref>, as opposed to multiple layers of processes, increases performance by avoiding context switches at each synchronization point, 32 * the special case coding of the most popular path through the network code can allow significant optimizations (e.g.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, packets are easily associated with virtual circuits for charging purposes. 3.2 The DARPA Internet The design philosophy of the DARPA Internet architecture has been summed up as <ref> [Clark 88] </ref>: "The top level goal for the DARPA Internet Architecture was to develop an effective technique for multiplexed utilization of existing intercon nected networks." The existing networks to be interconnected were a collection of heterogeneous packet switched networks, and together with an interpretation of effective technique, led to the following

Reference-contexts: By convention, X-25 provides a highly reliable service, and certain groups are pressing for an even higher reliability X-25 / CONS service so that the minimal OSI transport class (class 0) can be used <ref> [COSINE 88] </ref>. This high reliability is achieved by hop by hop flow control and retransmission mechanisms within the X-25 network. Such mechanisms not only complicate, and hence slow down, each switching node, but also mean that the end to end communication is only as reliable as the intervening switching nodes.

Reference-contexts: Although it is possible to implement a version of the basic block protocol to allow multiplexed reception from different stations by use of the source station as a demul-tiplexer, as in the Universal receiver protocol <ref> [Fraser 89] </ref>, the problem of multiple channels between two stations, particularly two bridges, is not solved.

Reference-contexts: For example, the use of forward error correction or error compensation in the encoding [Verbiest 89], or splitting the traffic into a high and a low priority channel <ref> [Ghanbari 89] </ref>, have been suggested. <p> Work on adaptive algorithms for TCP [Jacobson 88] has provided interesting performance improvements, and some work has been performed for multi-service traffic types <ref> [Ghanbari 89] </ref>. To execute intelligent adaptive algorithms requires a range of new services from a multi-service architecture. For example, accurate error and utilization statistics, and support for dynamic reconfiguration of circuits. 8.1.3 Multicast Certain models of distributed computing (e.g.

Reference-contexts: Most of the experimental work for this dissertation, concerned with ATM aspects, has been performed using this network. 2.4.2 The Cambridge Backbone Network The Cambridge backbone network (CBN) <ref> [Greaves 88] </ref> is a metropolitan area backbone network, designed primarily to provide interconnection of CFR local area networks. It shares many of the features of the CFR, including the slot format, and 14 represents another ATM network with subtly different properties.

Reference-contexts: If similar network interface implementation techniques are used for the backbone network, a node would achieve less than 10% of the possible point to point performance and about 2.5% of total available bandwidth. The implementation of hardware assist for protocols for the CBN is considered mandatory <ref> [Greaves 89a] </ref> and will be the subject of future work. Similar techniques will need to be applied to the network interface for the Fairisle network where single node access rates of 140Mb/s are targeted. 8.2.3 WANDA and ANSA The WANDA kernel is a multiprocessor kernel for distributed systems research.

Reference-contexts: Combined with the response mechanism, this again allows the provision of an arbitrarily reliable cell transfer but may not preserve cell order. Full details of the design and implementation of the Cambridge backbone network are to be found in <ref> [Greaves 89b] </ref>. 2.4.3 DQDB The distributed queuing dual bus (DQDB) network [IEEE 8026 89] (based on the earlier QPSX [Budrikis 86]), provides a hybrid approach to multi-service networks.

Reference-contexts: Another aspect of this flexible architecture approach is the provision of out of band management services. These services are used by portals to establish communication with peer portals at remote sites. These functions include services such as ISDN I-series signaling and dynamic bandwidth management by use of B-channel aggregation <ref> [Harita 89] </ref> [Burren 89]. The use of out of band techniques for management, allows the in-band ATM channel to be utilized effectively in a completely portal specific manner.

Reference-contexts: traffic that these uses represent. 2.4 ATM Implementations A number of networks can be classed as ATM networks, and this section provides a brief overview of some of the network designs at which the MSN architecture is aimed. 2.4.1 The Cambridge Fast Ring The Cambridge fast ring (CFR) [Temple 84] <ref> [Hopper 88] </ref> is a slotted ring network, designed as a local area network (LAN). Each slot is of a fixed size, and is composed of 4 control bits, 16 bits each of destination and source address, 256 bits of data and 12 bits of combined CRC and response information.

Reference-contexts: The OSI ISO protocol suite currently provides for multiplexing within six of the seven layers of the model 1 . 1 The presentation layer is the exception, although for architectural consistency, the naming and addressing scheme incorporates presentation level address selectors <ref> [ISO 74983 ] </ref>. 6 The characteristics of various networks, and hence the services they support, are almost entirely dictated by the exact design and implementation of this layered sequence of time division multiplexing mechanisms. There are two extremes, traditionally referred to as circuit switched, and packet switched networks.

Reference-contexts: X-25 over logical link control (LLC) type 2 in IEEE 802 networks [ISO 88022 ]). This extended set of specifications has been adopted as the European functional standard to provide the OSI connection oriented network service (CONS) 1 . The OSI transport service <ref> [ISO 8073 84] </ref>, and its precursor within JANET, the JNT Yellow Book Transport Service [YBTS 80], defines a transport service for use over CONS / X-25. <p> NETBLT [Clark 87]), have been based on combinations of rate based flow control and selective retransmission. These mechanisms are in contrast to the windowed and positive acknowledgement mechanisms of more traditional transport protocols, such as the DARPA transmission control protocol (TCP [Postel 81] and the ISO OSI transport service <ref> [ISO 8073 84] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The success of the Internet protocol family is seen by its widespread use, and that it has been basis for the ISO OSI connectionless network protocol (CLNP) <ref> [ISO 8473 86] </ref>. Many aspects of the protocols have been researched, and a number of them are worth closer scrutiny here: * global addressing in each packet, * packets routed individually, * packet fragmentation possible at any node, * per packet demultiplexing.

Reference-contexts: Recent 19 work has aimed at separating the different layers present within the original X-25 specification with the aim of extending the service over different datalink layers (e.g. X-25 over logical link control (LLC) type 2 in IEEE 802 networks <ref> [ISO 88022 ] </ref>). This extended set of specifications has been adopted as the European functional standard to provide the OSI connection oriented network service (CONS) 1 .

Reference-contexts: Adaptive protocols are required, which can modify their internal algorithms (e.g. change timeouts, encodings, etc.) to adjust to the different characteristics that different instances of communication may exhibit, even when between the same end systems. Work on adaptive algorithms for TCP <ref> [Jacobson 88] </ref> has provided interesting performance improvements, and some work has been performed for multi-service traffic types [Ghanbari 89]. To execute intelligent adaptive algorithms requires a range of new services from a multi-service architecture.

Reference-contexts: This requests a dump of the receivers state, including error map, allocation window etc. A transmitter can then use this information to perform retransmissions or adjust parameters such as the flow rate. 79 7.5 The VMP network adaptor board The VMP network adaptor board <ref> [Kanakia 88] </ref> is a design of a high performance network interface to support the versatile message transfer protocol (VMTP) for the VMP multiprocessor. This aims to o*oad the common case processing of packets from the main host processor.

Reference-contexts: This means that there is no guarantee about the order in which a host receives the fragments, and hence there is no sensible mechanism for deciding when to terminate reassembly. Experiments have shown <ref> [Kent 87] </ref> that performance can be radically improved by preventing IP fragmentation of packets altogether, and making use of the recovery mechanisms present in the transport level, in this case TCP. <p> IP fragmentation has been considered harmful by certain researchers <ref> [Kent 87] </ref>, and although some of the ground rules for MSSAR are different, some lessons have been learnt. The sequence number starts at the maximum value and decreases to one.

Reference-contexts: This also addresses the issues of host interfacing. 81 Chapter 8 Further work Within DARPA, the Gigabit Working Group has been addressing a wide range of issues concerning high bandwidth networking <ref> [Leiner 88] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Work concerned with demonstrating the utilization of the upper levels of the architecture (in terms of the OSI model, the transport, session and presentation levels) by a distributed computing mechanism, has been performed over UNIX, using the Unity RPC mechanism <ref> [McAuley 87] </ref>. 1.3 Outline Chapter 2 presents a characterization of digital networks in terms of their multiplexing mechanisms. The case for the use of asynchronous transfer mode is presented, along with the general mechanisms to support traffic normally conveyed on circuit and packet switched networks. <p> session makes use of the MSDL de-multiplexing function to allow ciphering to be performed on the fly as packets enter and leave the host, as discussed in section 5.4.1. 69 6.2.3 Implementation The particular system chosen for the implementation of these ideas was the Unity remote procedure call (RPC) system <ref> [McAuley 87] </ref>. Many of the application level entities within the Unison network, in particular those associated with exchange management, use this RPC mechanism, as it provides interoperability between a wide range of different application environments 3 .

Reference-contexts: In the Universe project, the networks to be connected were Cambridge rings, and the wide area interconnect was provided by a 1 Mb/s satellite broadcast channel. The rings to be connected all supported the Cambridge model distributed computing environment <ref> [Needham 82] </ref>, and the desire was to extend the distributed computing mechanisms present in this system to the wide area. The Universe network used the concept of lightweight virtual circuits. <p> Such loss of contact may well happen due to a reboot of the the relevant host or interface. A demonstration AMS has been built. The functions supported by this server are even simpler than those performed by the original Cambridge Ring nameserver <ref> [Needham 82] </ref>, and experience shows that such a simple object can be made extremely reliable.

Reference-contexts: In many measurements of RPC systems, the performance of the system is critically dependent on the network round trip time. Many approachs have been taken to reduce this time, and most have involved removing in band information <ref> [Nelson 81] </ref>. Unfortunately, the mechanisms supported by this in band information are not usually replaced, and so we see many RPC mechanisms throwing out internetworking, and using raw datalink levels to achieve high performance.

Reference-contexts: Data cells (QA cells) come in a variety of subtypes, for example, control, error recovery and data cells. Access to all of these data cells is asynchronous, and media access is by a distributed queuing algorithm <ref> [Newman 86] </ref>. By continuously monitoring all data cells on both busses as they pass the network node, the state of a distributed access queue is maintained. The algorithm provides immediate access at low utilization while preventing wasted capacity at high load.

Reference-contexts: Connecting multiple switches together into a network promises to provide a network of very high aggregate capacity. The Cambridge fast packet switch provides a switch capacity of up to 150 Gbit/s using conservative 50 MHz CMOS gate array technology <ref> [Newman 88] </ref>. Much of the work on fast packet switching has involved simulation and single switch design, only a few full size networks have been built.

Reference-contexts: The implementation of such a mechanism in software is straightforward. However, if the router is implemented in hardware, so must the replication mechanism. <ref> [Newman 89] </ref> suggests the insertion of a destination delete slotted ring between the input controllers and switch fabric; simulation studies are currently under way. 83 8.2 Implementation issues 8.2.1 Hardware router The similarity between the hardware required to implement the CFR MAC layer bridge and an MSNL CFR to CFR router

Reference-contexts: As others have found, experimental networking within currently deployed operating systems, such as the UNIX kernel, can be a time consuming and unrewarding process. Besides the unfriendliness of the runtime environment, operating system overheads can completely mask performance differences due to the network architecture <ref> [Nordmark 89] </ref>. For this reason most of the network and datalink level experimentation, has been performed within a simple message passing kernel, MICA, running over an Acorn Archimedes personal computer.

Reference-contexts: NETBLT [Clark 87]), have been based on combinations of rate based flow control and selective retransmission.

Reference-contexts: Although ATM solves this problem, it is not the only solution. A number of attempts based on providing explicit isochronous channels to support voice and video have been investigated (e.g. FDDI-II <ref> [Ross 86] </ref>, DQDB [Budrikis 86]). Unfortunately this approach does not represent an integrated solution, rather it provides time division multiplexing between an STM network and a PTM network, with the following effects: * fixed bandwidth allocation, * distinct channels, * restrictions on real time equipment.

Reference-contexts: Such a reliable service is inappropriate for real time and distributed computing traffic, and in fact prevents the effective implementation of some of the recently investigated transport protocols. The importance of the end-to-end argument <ref> [Saltzer 84] </ref> in these cases cannot be over stressed. The X-25 virtual circuit interface is favoured by PTTs because, as in a fully circuit switched network, the calls, and their duration are a resource which can be charged for.

Reference-contexts: A sensibly implemented distributed multicast service can significantly reduce the total network bandwidth used by an application by ensuring that data is only transferred between two sites once, even when there are multiple recipients at the receiving site. Work in this area has been performed within the Unison project <ref> [Shrimpton 87] </ref>, and providing a similar service within the MSN architecture should not be difficult. To implement multicast, the MSNL addressing scheme needs to be extended to handle multicast addresses, and similarly the liaison set up mechanism needs modification.

Reference-contexts: The Cambridge ring portal provides the functions of the Universe bridge between sites, i.e. transfer of basic blocks. This is an example of a portal acting at the datalink level, details of which are to be found in <ref> [Tennenhouse 88] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, removing the support for broadcast in a bridged network results in lack of transparency, and the breakage of some higher level protocols. An example of this problem can be seen within the Athena project <ref> [Treese 88] </ref>; Ethernet broadcast must be provided to support address resolution for IP, but applications using broadcast have been removed. 7.1.1 CFR MAC layer bridge Of particular interest and relevance to the MSN architecture is the CFR MAC layer bridge [Porter 89].

Reference-contexts: To overcome this problem, a number of mechanisms have been suggested which build directly on top of an unreliable transport service, such as MSNL or MSSAR, and are independent of round trip delay 1 . For example, the use of forward error correction or error compensation in the encoding <ref> [Verbiest 89] </ref>, or splitting the traffic into a high and a low priority channel [Ghanbari 89], have been suggested.

Reference-contexts: Packet based traffic can easily be conveyed over ATM networks by straightforward fragmentation of higher level protocol units into ATM cells. Such mechanisms have always been used in a number of networks, such as slotted rings (Cambridge ring <ref> [Wilkes 79] </ref>) or slotted bus systems (DQDB [Budrikis 86]). The implementation of the fragmentation and reassembly algorithm for ATM requires extra processing power at end points over that required for a PTM network.

Reference-contexts: This extended set of specifications has been adopted as the European functional standard to provide the OSI connection oriented network service (CONS) 1 . The OSI transport service [ISO 8073 84], and its precursor within JANET, the JNT Yellow Book Transport Service <ref> [YBTS 80] </ref>, defines a transport service for use over CONS / X-25. By convention, X-25 provides a highly reliable service, and certain groups are pressing for an even higher reliability X-25 / CONS service so that the minimal OSI transport class (class 0) can be used [COSINE 88].
