Abstract: In this paper we present one aspect of our research on machine translation (MT): capturing the grammatical and computational relation between (i) the interlingua (IL) as defined declaratively in the lexicon and (ii) the IL as defined procedurally by way of algorithms that compose and decompose pivot IL forms. We begin by examining the interlinguas in the lexicons of a variety of current IL-based approaches to MT. This brief survey makes it clear that no consensus exists among MT researchers on the level of representation for defining the IL. In the section that follows, we explore the consequences of this missing formal framework for MT system builders who develop their own lexical-IL entries. The lack of software tools to support rapid IL respecification and testing greatly hampers their ability to modify representations to handle new data and new domains. Our view is that IL-based MT research needs both (a) the formal framework to specify possible IL grammars and (b) the software support tools to implement and test these grammars. With respect to (a), we propose adopting a lexicalized grammar approach, tapping research results from the study of tree grammars for natural language syntax. With respect to (b), we sketch the design and functional specifications for parts of ILustrate, the set of software tools that we need to implement and test the various IL formalisms that meet the requirements of a lexicalized grammar. In this way, we begin to address a basic issue in MT research, how to define and test an interlingua as a computational language | without building a full MT system for each possible IL formalism that might be proposed.

Reference-contexts: TOWARD A LEXICALIZED GRAMMAR FOR INTERLINGUAS 141 The first assumption is that the lexical IL forms that feed into the Pivot-Form Component exist at one predefined depth, or level of representation, beyond which further analysis does not occur. (Indeed in the classic transfer and IL "pyramid" diagram in <ref> (Hutchins and Somers, 1992, p. 107) </ref>, one can even "see" this depth of analysis metaphor.) The second implicit assumption is that adequate translation is achieved only through exhaustive coverage at a single level of representation (Nirenburg et al., 1992). 2.1.

These operations can all be formulated as context-free tree rewrite rules involving the operations of tree replacement and tree composition (as in <ref> (Schimpf and Gallier, 1985) </ref>), modified as needed for complex nodes with type checking. 28 Context-free tree grammars also provide a way of formalizing the derivational history trees for pivot IL forms discussed above.
