Abstract: The scheduling of exams in institutions of higher education is known to be a highly constrained problem. The advent of modularity in many institutions in the UK has resulted in a significant increase in its complexity, imposing even more difficulties on university administrators who must find a solution, often without any computer aid. Of the many methods that have been applied to solving the problem automatically, evolutionary techniques have shown much promise due to their general purpose optimisation capabilities. However, it has also been found that hybrid evolutionary methods can yield even better results. In this paper we present such a hybrid approach in the form of an evolutionary algorithm that incorporates local search methods (known as a memetic algo rithm).

Reference-contexts: These two rules define a feasible timetable, and were the objective merely to find a feasible timetable, the problem could be solved using a variety of methods such as heuristic assignment <ref> [1] </ref> . However, we are usually interested in finding good feasible timetables, which can be defined as one that is practical and with which the user is happy.

Reference-contexts: However, we are usually interested in finding good feasible timetables, which can be defined as one that is practical and with which the user is happy. It follows that many different institutions will have differing views on what constitutes a good timetable <ref> [2] </ref> and therefore the engine of any automated timetabling system must be capable of satisfying the wide range of constraints that may be specified.

Reference-contexts: It is unlikely that, given the length of the average exam period and the number of suitable rooms available for exam sittings, that all of the above constraints could be satisfied completely. The optimisation capabilities of Genetic Algorithms <ref> [3] </ref> have been found to work well on various timetabling problems [4-6] , usually by first ensuring satisfaction of the conditions for a feasible timetable, and then optimising the number of desirable but not essential constraints that are satisfied. 1.2.

Reference-contexts: This significant difference in results offers justification for the use of memetic algorithms and the operators within it. Although the initial results are promising, the results have shown that the algorithm does not perform quite as well on the more highly constrained problems as some other methods <ref> [4] </ref> Therefore further research will be directed at refining the existing operators and introducing new ones. Experimentation with various methods of recombining different solutions found by the existing operators is of particular interest. This may include hybrid heuristic recombination operators such as those presented in [11] .

Reference-contexts: It has also been suggested that maybe local search has a part to play [8, 9] , this approach being known as memetics. A directed mutation approach has also been found to achieve good results <ref> [5] </ref>. The algorithm presented here has been found to work well (see section 3) using a combination of light and heavy random mutation, followed directly by application of hill climbing techniques. Figure 3 shows the cycle of evolution for the algorithm.

Reference-contexts: Genetic Algorithms Genetic algorithms are a general purpose optimisation tool based on Darwin's theory of evolution. They have the capability to produce optimised solutions even when the dimensions of the problem increase and for this reason they have been successfully applied to a wide variety of problems <ref> [7] </ref> . Genetic Algorithms operate on a population of solutions represented by some coding. Each member of the population consists of a number of genes, each of which is a unit of information.

Reference-contexts: A simulation of `natural selection' then takes place by first evaluating the quality of each solution and then selecting the fittest ones to survive to the next generation. 1.3. Memetic Algorithms The concept of a memetic algorithm was first introduced by Moscato and Norman <ref> [8] </ref> to describe evolutionary algorithms in which local search is used to a large extent. This idea has further been formalised by Rad-cliffe & Surrey [9] and a comparison between memetic and genetic algorithms made. <p> The Evolutionary Operators There has been some debate as to whether crossover should be the main operator in a Genetic Algorithm. It has also been suggested that maybe local search has a part to play <ref> [8, 9] </ref> , this approach being known as memetics. A directed mutation approach has also been found to achieve good results [5].

Reference-contexts: The addition of the Hill-Climbing operator after each mutation operator greatly increases the speed at which better solutions are found above the evolutionary operators alone. While the application of Hill-Climbing after each operation - 8 - does involve some computational expense, this is reduced by the use of delta-evaluation <ref> [10] </ref> and can be compensated for by the simplicity of the mutation operators, with any remaining net increase being justified by the reduction in total evaluations required.
