Abstract: Performance analysis of computer networks is rapidly gaining importance as networks increase in size and geographical extent. A simulation approach is often useful. This report describes REAL, a computer network simulator, and presents results of some simulations to illustrate its analytical power. Details of implementation and a performance evaluation are also presented.
