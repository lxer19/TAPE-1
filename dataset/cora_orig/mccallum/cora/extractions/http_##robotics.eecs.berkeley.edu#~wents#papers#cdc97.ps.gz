Title: A Recursive Workspace Balancing Controller for a 3D Multibody Model of a Biped  
Author: Jeffrey M. Wendlandt

Affiliation: Intelligent Machines and Robotics Laboratory University of California at  
Abstract: This paper describes a balancing controller for a 3D multibody model of a human biped. This model-based controller forms a model using a recursive formulation of workspace control. The recursive techniques free the control designer from generating the complicated equations of motion. The paper describes first the biped model and then the recursive workspace controller. Simulation results of the human model reacting to a disturbance are presented.

Sastry. </author> <title> Recursive workspace control of multibody systems: A planar biped example. </title> <booktitle> In IEEE Control and Decision Conference, </booktitle> <address> Kobe, Japan, </address> <year> 1996. </year> <month> Dec. </month> <pages> 11-13, </pages> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: The control system must coordinate the degrees of freedom while handling the added complexities caused by the intermittent contact with the environment. In this paper, the planar results in <ref> [1] </ref> are extended to create a workspace balancing controller for a 3D model of a biped. The kinematics and dynamic equations are more complex, and there are more degrees of freedom to control. The paper first describes the biped model and then presents an overview of the recursive workspace controller. <p> The controller compensates for the disturbances and drives the error to a neighborhood of zero. 5 Conclusion The balancing controller extends the planar results in <ref> [1] </ref> to create a workspace balancing controller for a 3D multibody model of a biped. A model-based controller is formed in the workspace of the 3D biped, and the model is efficiently calculated through link to link iterations in the multibody structure.

Impulse is a multibody simulator that handles contact through impulses. The controller is written in C and interfaced to the simulator.

Reference-contexts: The workspace dynamics calculation consists of an inboard recursion from the feet to the central body. The workspace dynamics calculation produces the approximate workspace dynamics for the central body. This stage calculates the articulated body (AB) inertia <ref> [3] </ref> and bias forces of the inboard link based on the AB inertia and bias forces of the outboard link. The AB inertia and bias forces relate an external force applied to a link to the acceleration of that link and take into account the links outboard to the link. <p> The AB inertia and bias force for the central body provide the approximate workspace dynamics. AB inertias and bias forces are discussed in many references including <ref> [3] </ref>, [4], [5], and [2]. The recursive workspace controller assumes that the feet are fixed to the floor. We approximate this condition from a big base assumption presented in [4]. <p> The first term in b b k:o is the gravitational force written in the coordinates of link k:o. 3.4 Workspace Dynamics Calculation The approximate workspace dynamics are calculated through a recursion from the feet to the body. The algorithm calculates the articulated body (AB) inertia <ref> [3] </ref> and bias forces of the inboard link based on the AB inertia and bias force of the outboard link. The AB inertia and bias forces for the central body are calculated in the last step in the iteration. The calculations are given in Algorithm 3.
