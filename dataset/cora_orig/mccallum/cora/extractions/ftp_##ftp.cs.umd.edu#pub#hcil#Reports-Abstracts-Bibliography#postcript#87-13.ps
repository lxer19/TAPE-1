Abstract: The optimal number of menu items per display screen has been the topic of considerable debate and study. On the one hand, some designers have packed many items into each menu to conserve space and reduce the number of menus, whereas on the other hand there are designers who prefer a sparse display for menu structures and other videotex information. This study evaluated the effects of a broad/ shallow menu compared to a narrow/deep menu structure under two conditions of time stress for inexperienced users. Results indicated that time stress both slowed performance and increased errors. In addition, it was demonstrated that the broad/ shallow menu was faster and resulted in fewer errors. Implications for menu design are discussed.

Reference-contexts: Most of the research has compared the time it takes to search through menu selection systems which are constructed in a hierarchical or tree like fashion, and the majority of these studies indicate that menus that provide a larger number of alternatives per screen enjoy an advantage in performance speed <ref> (Paap & Roske-Hofstrand, 1986) </ref>. Breadth advantages Possible advantages for broad menu systems include decreased memory load upon the user, recognition of actions for the user to select rather than recall of those 652.3 Time stress effects commands. <p> Another factor favoring breadth is that hierarchical menu trees with greater depth may be more subject to navigation problems such as getting lost, or using an inefficient pathway to the goal <ref> (Paap & Roske-Hofstrand, 1986) </ref>. Similarly, Snowberry, Parkinson & Sisson (1993) found error rate increases from 4% for a single level menu to 34% for six levels.

Reference-contexts: Although several interaction strategies have been employed by designers, one of the more common interfaces used to provide the less experienced computer user with choices about the possible actions in using word processors or spreadsheets is menu selection <ref> (Parton et al., 1985) </ref>.
