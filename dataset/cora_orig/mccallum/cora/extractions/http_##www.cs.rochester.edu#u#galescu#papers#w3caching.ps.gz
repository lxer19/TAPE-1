Title: World Wide Web Caching  
Author: Lucian Galescu 
Date: December 19, 1997  
Affiliation: Computer Science Department University of Rochester  
Abstract: As the size of the World Wide Web increases at a rate much higher than that of adding networking infrastructure, the perceived latency of the Web becomes an important issue. This paper surveys the research done in the past few years on caching, which is one of the techniques that attempts to keep low the traffic on the Web. After introducing the problem and the general idea of how to solve it, the paper will concentrate on different issues related to caching: what are its advantages and disadvantages, what caching policies can be used, what caching topologies and protocols have been proposed, and then go into more detail about maintaining a cache.

Reference-contexts: In such a case, if a new cacheable document is arriving, obviously something else should be evicted from the cache. There have been many removal policies proposed, and a good analysis can be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. The problem is different, from that of replacement in memory and disk caching, since the files are not all the same size. Therefore, the policies 7 that give good results may be different.
