Abstract: We describe use of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for data-driven automatic design of RASTA-like filters. The LDA applied to rather long segments of time trajectories of critical-band energies yields FIR filters to be applied to these time trajectories in the feature extraction module. Frequency responses of the first three discriminant vectors are in principle consistent with the ad hoc designed RASTA, delta and double-delta filters. On a connected digit task the new features outperform the original RASTA processing.

Reference-contexts: On the other hand, the knowledge hardwired into the feature extraction module is the knowledge which does not have to be re-acquired from the data every time the recognizer is used for a new task. In the late seventies, Hunt <ref> [1] </ref> proposed the use of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for deriving improved features for ASR. <p> Therefore, data-based optimization which would avoid using a specific ASR paradigm is desirable. The linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a stochastic technique which optimizes linear discriminability between classes (see e.g. <ref> [1] </ref> for examples of LDA in ASR). We examine the use of LDA for data-driven design of RASTA-like filters. 2. TECHNIQUE of the time trajectory of a single logarithmic critical-band energy.

Reference-contexts: Standard HMM-based systems do classification over this short time span under the assumption of independence of the short-term acoustic vectors. The peripheral human auditory system appears to be able to effectively integrate rather large time-spans (around 200 msec) of the audio signal <ref> [2] </ref>. Several emergent techniques employ short-term feature vectors from medium-span segments of speech. Among them, the RASTA technique [3] does band-pass filtering of time trajectories of speech features.

To alleviate harmful effects of convolutive distortions, frequency components of time trajectories of logarithmic critical-band spectral energies below 1 Hz and above 12 Hz are attenuated. Such processing was found optimal by ASR experiments. 1.2.

Reference-contexts: EUROSPEECH'97, Rhodes, Greece 1997. The vector space for the LDA is constructed from segments of the time trajectory of a single logarithmic critical-band energy over a relatively long (typically about 1 s) span of time <ref> [4] </ref>. These segments are overlapped with a one frame spacing. This approach is different from previous works using LDA [1, 5] since it applies LDA to rather long time trajectories of features rather than just to a single feature vector or to a relatively short block of feature vectors. <p> We will show that even when the filters are designed on a database different from the one on which they are eventually used they can still outperform other processing methods. 3. DISCRIMINANT VECTORS AS FILTERS In previous work we <ref> [4] </ref> showed that the frequency response of the first discriminant vector agrees well with the frequency response of the ad hoc designed RASTA filter that smooths the feature trajectory. We stress the significance of this result.

Reference-contexts: First, we apply the LDA to a hand-labeled subset of the Switchboard database. This database is labeled according to standard conventions into a set of 56 American English phonemes. Additionally, this database also contained classes of between-word pauses, and utterance beginning and end silences <ref> [6] </ref>. Second, the Switchboard database is appended by the identical database but with an added simulated convolutional variability. This is achieved by adding a constant approximately representing 2 standard deviations of the data to each time trajectory.

Reference-contexts: The similarity of the first discriminant vectors from all three databases with the original RASTA filter is noticeable. The impulse responses of the first discriminant vector is approximately symmetric, implying close to zero phase and supporting de Veeth and Boves <ref> [7] </ref>. RASTA filter and the RASTA filter combined with the delta and double-delta filters. The first discriminant vector, while being the most important for discrimination, explains only about 80% of the variability in the data. We therefore decided to investigate the second and third discriminant vectors as well.

Reference-contexts: The frequency characteristic of the second and third discriminant vectors are somewhat comparable to the second (slope) and third (curvature) orthogonal polynomials approximating the time trajectory of the feature within a 9 frame (90 ms) time interval as proposed by Furui <ref> [8] </ref>. The second peak at around 1 Hz in the two-peak filters can be simulated by adding a small bias to the double-delta orthogonal polynomial.
