Abstract: Parity violating elastic electron-nucleus scattering provides an accurate and model independent measurement of neutron densities, because the Z 0 couples primarily to neutrons. Coulomb distortion corrections to the parity violating asymmetry A l are calculated exactly using a relativistic optical model. Distortions significantly reduce A l in a heavy nucleus. However even with distortions, an experiment to measure the neutron radius is feasible. This will aid the interpretation of future atomic parity violation measurements and provide fundamental nuclear structure information. Coulomb distortions and small differences between neutron and proton radii could be important for a standard model test on 4 He, 12 C or 16 O.

Reference-contexts: 12 C was performed <ref> [1] </ref> (with somewhat limited accuracy). Second, it is sensitive to strange quarks in the nucleon or nucleus. Proposed Jefferson Laboratory experiments hope to extract strange quark contributions to the electric form factor of the nucleon from elastic scattering on 4 He [2].

Finally, parity violation provides a unique and very clean way to study neutron densities and isospin violation in nuclei [3]. <p> We note that the solid curve crosses the dashed curve just beyond 50 degrees. This is near the second maximum in the form factor and corresponds to the kinematics of a planned experiment <ref> [2] </ref>. At this momentum transfer, q, the derivative of the cross section with q goes to zero which reduces some systematic errors (such as those from helicity correlated changes in q).

[Note, the Z 0 proton coupling depends on the small factor 1 4sin 2 fi W .] An accurate measurement of neutron distributions in a heavy nucleus would provide fundamental nuclear structure information.

Reference-contexts: This could be important in astrophysics when one extrapolates to unstable very asymmetric nuclei. Furthermore, a measurement of neutron radii will significantly aid the interpretation of future atomic parity violation measurements. The present Cs experiment is accurate to 0.3 percent <ref> [4] </ref>. Pushing the accuracy of atomic experiments is important as a test of the standard model and as a search for new physics.

Reference-contexts: Pushing the accuracy of atomic experiments is important as a test of the standard model and as a search for new physics. However, a 0.1 percent measurement in a heavy atom will require knowing the neutron radius to of order one percent <ref> [5] </ref> (to keep uncertainties in the neutron density from interfering with a standard model test). The charge density is known from elastic electron scattering. Thus, to determine the neutron radius to one percent requires knowing the difference between neutron and proton radii to about 25 percent.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a measurement of the parity violating asymmetry for elastic electron scattering should provide crucial information for atomic parity experiments. Atomic experiments also depend on atomic theory (the overlap of electronic wave function with the nucleus) which at present is only good to about one percent in Cs <ref> [6] </ref>. However, this accuracy may improve in the future. If this is not the case, atomic experiments may shift to measuring ratios of parity violation in different isotopes because many of the atomic uncertainties cancel.

Reference-contexts: This is related to the angle through which the electron's spin is rotated when it scatters from the nucleus <ref> [7] </ref>. The normal analyzing power A y is of order m e =E and vanishes in Born approximation. It is very small, comparable to A l ! We will discuss A y in a future paper. The numerical details of the code will also be presented in a later paper.

Reference-contexts: Here we describe some of the checks which give us confidence in our results. First the code must reproduce known cross sections. For example, elastic cross sections from 208 P b at 502 MeV are reproduced out to 3.7 Fm 1 (the extent of the data <ref> [8] </ref>). Near 3.7 Fm 1 the error is of order a percent. The cross section at these large angles is reduced by many orders of magnitude. This requires that the scattering amplitude be calculated very accurately: indeed, more accurately then needed for the forward angle A l (see below).

Reference-contexts: This allows one to see the effects of only coulomb distortions. Then we show results for different weak and electromagnetic densities. To start, we use a simple three parameter Fermi charge density for 208 Pb from ref. <ref> [9] </ref>, see Table I. This fits all but the back angle electron scattering data. The weak density is assumed to be proportional to the charge density, W (r) = [ Z This satisfies the normalization condition of Eq. (4).
