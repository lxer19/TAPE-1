Abstract: An earlier version of this paper appeared in the Proceedings of the 6 th USENIX C++ Conference, Cambridge, MA, April 11-14, 1994. Abstract The ADAPTIVE Service eXecutive (ASX) is a highly modular and extensible object-oriented framework that simplifies the development and configuration of distributed applications on shared memory multi-processor platforms. This paper describes the structure and functionality of the ASX framework's object-oriented architecture. In addition, the paper presents the results of performance experiments conducted using ASX-based implementations of connection-oriented and connectionless protocols from the TCP/IP protocol family. These experiments measure the performance impact of alternative methods for parallelizing communication protocol stacks. Throughout the paper, examples are presented to indicate how the use of object-oriented techniques facilitate application extensibility, component reuse, and performance enhancement.
