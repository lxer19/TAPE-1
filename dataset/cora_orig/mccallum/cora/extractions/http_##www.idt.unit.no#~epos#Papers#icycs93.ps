Abstract: This paper introduces a mechanism coping with cooperative work in developing and maintaning software artifacts in a multi-user engineering environment. For the long time it has been a problem to handle parallel activities on shared or interdependent products. The required mechanism must be sufficiently flexible to support concurrent updates so that none of new updates will be lost, nor lots of work will be rejected and restarted.

Reference-contexts: Since each transaction has its own WS the WS's are also organized in a hierarchical structure. Only leaf transactions 2 Adapted after Adele's proposed design for workspace coordination. <ref> [BEM91] </ref> are supposed to do any real update work. Non-leaf transactions possess WS's which serve as shared filepools for their children. The organization of checked-out files in WS's is illustrated by figure 1.

Reference-contexts: The following sections will attempt to satify these requirements. 3.2 Protocol for Change Propagation After a transaction starts, its ambition will be compared with the ambitions of ongoing transactions. If any overlap is detected, the two transactions has to negotiate a common protocol for handling conflicting updates <ref> [CM91] </ref>. The protocol P (T; T i ) for transaction T and its partner T i contains the following information: * Timing 2 , or when to receive and implicitly when to send: HARD coupling (Busy by default): All changes are propagated immediately.
