Abstract: In this paper we consider a general algorithmic framework for solving nonlinear mixed complementarity problems. The main features of this framework are: (a) it is well-defined for an arbitrary mixed complementarity problem, (b) it generates only feasible iterates, (c) it has a strong global convergence theory, and (d) it is locally fast convergent under standard regularity assumptions. This framework is applied to the PATH solver in order to show viability of the approach, and numerical results for an appropriate modification of the PATH solver indicate that this framework leads to substantial computational improvements. 4 Current address (October 1, 1997 - September 30, 1998): Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin - Madison, 1210 West Dayton Street, 53706 Madison, WI; e-mail: kanzow@cs.wisc.edu.

Reference-contexts: Note that, due to the convexity of our feasible set [l; u], this guarantees that all the points x k + t k d k ; t k 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> are feasible, too. On the other hand, property (b) states that, under Robinson's strong regularity condition, Algorithm A is locally well-defined and generates a locally superlinearly convergent search direction. <p> However, since we assume that none of the iterates x k is a stationary point of (22), this follows, e.g., from Proposition 2.3.3 (a) in Bertsekas <ref> [1] </ref>. For the second part of the theorem, let x fl be a stationary point of the sequence fx k g; and assume that fx k g K is a subsequence converging to x fl . <p> Since the iterates x k belong to the feasible set [l; u] for all k 2 IN and since the sequence f (x k )g is monotonically decreasing, it is not difficult to see that the proof of Proposition 2.3.3 (b) in Bertsekas <ref> [1] </ref> can be adapted in a straightforward manner to establish that x fl is a stationary point of the constrained reformulation (25). Hence we can assume without loss of generality that all iterates k 2 K satisfy the descent condition (23).

Our class of algorithms globalizes Algorithm A as follows. We use the merit function to measure any progress. If the point generated by Algorithm A has a function value of sufficiently smaller than the previous one, it is accepted as the new iterate.

Reference-contexts: This procedure has been implemented and successfully used in the PATH code described in <ref> [9, 14] </ref>. A key implementational difficulty remains what to do when the linearization subproblem has no solution. The theory assumes this situation does not happen. In practice, this occurs frequently, particularly if the user of the code does not provide a good initial starting point. <p> Several methods satisfy the above two conditions. For example, one may take the Josephy-Newton method as Algorithm A, see Josephy [17, 23]. Alternatively, the method suggested by Ralph [27] has these two properties.

The PATH solver is described in detail in <ref> [9, 14] </ref>. The code is extensively used by economists for solving general equilibrium problems and is well known to be robust and efficient on the majority of the mixed complementarity problems it encounters. <p> These subproblems are solved by generating a path between the current iterate and the solution of the linear subproblem; the precise details of this generation scheme can be found for example in <ref> [9] </ref>. A nonmono-tone backtracking search is performed on this path to garner sufficient decrease in its merit function, the norm of the residual of the normal map.

Reference-contexts: It is known that the solutions of the subproblem will eventually provide descent for the merit function and that local superlinear or quadratic convergence will occur under appropriate conditions. A crash procedure <ref> [11] </ref> is used to quickly identify an approximation to the active set at the solution; this is based on a projected Newton step for the normal map, but the direction produced is not known to be a descent direction for the merit function used. <p> This factor can be changed by setting the gradient step limit option to a suitable constant. Since the merit function in PATH 3.0 is nonsmooth, there is no possibility of carrying out a similar scheme in this code. We note that several heuristic procedures were described and tested in <ref> [11] </ref>; all of these appear not to be beneficial to PATH. MPSGE models are generated differently by GAMS [5], and thus a solver can distinguish them from general MCP models. We have used this information to choose different default options for MPSGE models both in PATH 3.0 and PATH-FB.

Reference-contexts: More precisely, we have the following result. Proposition 3.1 The function is continuously differentiable with gradient r (x) = H T (x) for an arbitrary H 2 @(x). Proof. The proof is essentially the same as that given for Proposition 3.4 by Facchinei and Soares <ref> [13] </ref> for the special case of a nonlinear complementarity problem. 2 We next provide a stationary point result for the unconstrained reformulation min (x); x 2 IR n ; of the mixed complementarity problem. <p> To simplify the proof, we invoke the following proposition from [20] (see also <ref> [13] </ref> for a similar result).

In the results reported in Table 1, we use exactly the same restart parameter settings in both codes (see [14]), with <p> in <ref> [14] </ref> that restarting PATH 3.0 from the user provided starting point after the algorithm failed to find a solution on the first attempt significantly improved the robustness of the code. In the results reported in Table 1, we use exactly the same restart parameter settings in both codes (see [14]), with the exception that the PATH-FB code is able to carry out at most 5 projected gradient steps when the direction provided by the linear subproblem is poor. This factor can be changed by setting the gradient step limit option to a suitable constant. <p> The remaining restart procedures (that are not used for any problem on our test set) are identical to those documented in <ref> [14] </ref>. As can be seen from the results of Tables 1 and 2, PATH-FB is considerably better than PATH 3.0 when the codes are not allowed to restart. The projected gradient steps allow progress to be made in this code, which cannot occur in PATH 3.0.

Reference-contexts: Set x k+1 := x k (t k ); k k + 1, and go to Step (S.1). Other methods have attempted to use projected gradient steps in conjunction with steps that give fast local convergence. See for example, Ferris and Ralph <ref> [15] </ref>. Unfortunately, these hybrid algorithms are difficult to implement and numerical testing has therefore only been carried out on small test examples. A key difference in the approach outlined here is that the implementation can be achieved as a minor modification of an existing code.

Reference-contexts: mixed complementarity problem consists of finding a vector x fl 2 [l; u] such that exactly one of the following holds: x fl x fl x fl The first component of this paper, described in Section 2, is a reformulation of the mixed complementarity problem, based on the Fischer-Burmeister function <ref> [16] </ref>. This results in an equivalent nonsmooth system of equations (x) = 0 where the corresponding merit function (x) := 2 1 k (x)k 2 is continuously differentiable. This fact, along with other pertinent properties of is the subject of Section 3. <p> These properties are important in subsequent sections. To this end, let us define the mapping : IR 2 ! IR by (a; b) := a 2 + b 2 a b: This function was introduced by Fischer <ref> [16] </ref> (and attributed to Burmeister) and is widely used in the context of nonlinear complementarity problems.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, statement (b) also follows by using an identical argument. 2 We next restate a useful characterization of Robinson's <ref> [28] </ref> strong regularity condition in the context of mixed complementarity problems. A proof may be found in [12]. <p> A proof may be found in [12]. We stress that, in the case of a nonlinear complementarity problem (i.e., l i = 0 and u i = 1 for all i 2 I), this characterization reduces to a standard characterization from Robinson <ref> [28] </ref>. 7 Proposition 2.5 The following two statements are equivalent: (a) x fl is a strongly regular solution of the mixed complementarity problem. (b) The submatrix F 0 (x fl ) ffff is nonsingular, and the Schur-complement F 0 (x fl ) ff [fi;ff [fi (x fl )=F 0 (x fl <p> in view of the definition of our merit 16 function, we see that the accumulation point x fl is a solution of the mixed complementarity problem and hence also a stationary point of problem (25). 2 We next want to show that Algorithm 4.1 is locally Q-superlinearly convergent under Robin-son's <ref> [28] </ref> strong regularity condition. The proof is in two parts. We first show that the entire sequence generated by Algorithm 4.1 converges to a solution x fl if this solution satisfies the strong regularity assumption. <p> Then the entire sequence fx k g converges to this point, and the rate of convergence is Q-superlinear. Proof. To establish convergence, we first note that a strongly regular solution is an isolated solution of the mixed complementarity problem, see <ref> [28] </ref>. Since Algorithm 4.1 generates a decreasing sequence f (x k )g and x fl is a solution of the mixed complementarity problem, the entire sequence f (x k )g converges to zero.

The algorithm successively linearizes the normal map <ref> [29] </ref> associated with the MCP, defined by F ([y] + ) + y [y] + where [y] + represents the projection of y onto [l; u] in the Euclidean norm, thereby generating a sequence of linear mixed complementarity problems.

Reference-contexts: Two tables are presented by splitting the problems into standard MCP models (Table 1) and models that were generated using the MPSGE preprocessor <ref> [30, 31] </ref> in GAMS (Table 2). In order to condense the information in Table 1, we have grouped several similar models together whenever this grouping results in no loss of information; for example, problems colvdual and colvnlp are grouped together as example colv* in Table 1.

Reference-contexts: must have r (x fl ) = 0, so that Theorem 3.3 gives the desired result that x fl is a solution of the mixed complementarity problem. 2 We believe that appropriate modifications of the above theory will enable us to use other merit functions such as those desribed in <ref> [6, 26, 32] </ref>. 4 Algorithmic Framework In this section, we present our class of algorithms for the solution of the mixed complementarity problem and the corresponding global and local convergence theory.
