Title: MOLECULAR MODELING OF PROTEINS AND MATHEMATICAL PREDICTION OF PROTEIN STRUCTURE  
Author: ARNOLD NEUMAIER 
Note: AMS subject classifications. primary 92C40; secondary 65L05, 90C26  
Abstract: This paper discusses the mathematical formulation of and solution attempts for the so-called protein folding problem. The static aspect is concerned with how to predict the folded (native, tertiary) structure of a protein, given its sequence of amino acids. The dynamic aspect asks about the possible pathways to folding and unfolding, including the stability of the folded protein. From a mathematical point of view, there are several main sides to the static problem: the selection of an appropriate potential energy function; the parameter identification by fitting to experimental data; and the global optimization of the potential. The dynamic problem entails, in addition, the solution of (because of multiple time scales very stiff) ordinary or stochastic differential equations (molecular dynamics simulation), or (in case of constrained molecular dynamics) of differential-algebraic equations. A theme connecting the static and dynamic aspect is the determination and formation of secondary structure motifs. The present paper gives a self-contained introduction to the necessary background from physics and chemistry and surveys some of the literature. It also discusses the various mathematical problems arising, some deficiencies of the current models and algorithms, and possible (past and future) attacks to arrive at solutions to the protein folding problem.

Reference-contexts: the statistical dynamics treatment surveyed in Wolynes [347] and references there), and there are some indications from molecular dynamics simulations (Elber & Karplus [89], Honeycutt & Thirumalai [146]) that this might be the situation in typical energy surfaces of proteins. (Temperature effects also play a role, see Abkevich et al. <ref> [2] </ref>.) On the other hand, calculations of Iori et al. [152], using a different model, arrive at the opposite conclusion.

Reference-contexts: Realistic choices for C are position (and probably also velocity) dependent non-diagonal matrices. These can be derived in terms of time correlation functions from the interaction with the solvent; see Deutch & Oppenheim [77], Ciccotti & Ryckaert [51] and Chapter 9 of Allen & Tildesley <ref> [3] </ref>. An estimation of the required time correlation functions can be obtained by molecular dynamics simulations involving explicit solvent molecules. The low temperature limit. In the low temperature limit T ! 0, the covari-ance matrix (2) vanishes; so this limit corresponds to the absence of random forces. <p> not clear about this relation; they usually treat the stochastic terms in an ad hoc manner that makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of the results obtained.)

Reference-contexts: More recently, fast multipole expansions [25, 120, 284] and variants [70, 91] of the Ewald method (Ewald [92]) were used as an alternative to cut-off methods, with a significant increase in quality York et al.

Reference-contexts: of view, the ab initio approach (with second derivative information) poses interesting questions about multidimensional Hermite interpolation (or approximation) and the optimal choice of trial points for the quantum mechanical calculations; since the least squares problems are here linear, traditional methods for the optimal design of experiments (see, e.g., Atkinson <ref> [9] </ref>, Atwood [10], Pukelsheim [241] and the books by Fedorov [94] or Silvey [286]) should lead to improved fits for the same amount of work. The assessment of the sensitivity of the parameters with respect to the input data generally received very little attention.

Reference-contexts: r are included in CHARMM. (For more in depth studies of pair potentials see Steele [303], Maitland [195].) It is quite possible that more accurate potentials will also need to take three-body forces into account, such as those given by so-called Axilrod-Teller terms, predicted by quantum mechanics (Axilrod & Teller <ref> [11] </ref>, Kihara & Ichimaru [165]). Taking the equilibrium distance R 0 between two atoms as the sum R 0 = R i + R j of the atomic radii is a simple intuitive instance of a combination rule designed to reduce the number of parameters that need to be supplied.

Reference-contexts: If we were able to solve the protein folding problem, it would greatly simplify the tasks of interpreting the data collected by the human genome project, understanding the mechanism of hereditary and infectuous diseases, designing drugs with specific therapeutical properties (see, e.g., Balbes et al. <ref> [12] </ref>), and of growing biological polymers with specific material properties.

Reference-contexts: Multiple time scales also arise in the dynamics of electrical circuits; multirate strategies developed in that context (see, e.g., the papers by Denk, by G unther & Rentrop and by Wriedt in Bank et al., <ref> [13] </ref>) may also prove useful to the dynamics of proteins. Robustness questions of numerical methods, related to the symplectic (Hamil-tonian) nature of the (undamped) dynamics and discussed, e.g., in Sanz-Serna [263] and Skeel et al. [292], may also turn out to be relevant.

Reference-contexts: Together, these developments offer a promising way out of the limitations described above, and allow already much larger step sizes of up to 10 12 sec, valuable for sampling. Indeed, significant speedup was achieved very recently by a simplified version of this approach in barth et al. <ref> [15] </ref>. The resulting scheme can be considered as a method with two different timesteps: ffit = 0:5 fi 10 15 sec for solving the harmonic model, and ffit = 5 fi 10 15 sec for updating the harmonic model.

Reference-contexts: Two recent 1995 reviews of secondary structure prediction are Barton <ref> [16] </ref> and Russell & Sternberg [257]. Currently, the best methods predict the correct assignment in only about 70% of the positions (Rost & Sander [255]).

Reference-contexts: In order to obtain a useful statistics, the protein structures used must be carefully selected; see, e.g., Hobohm et al. [141]. A more detailed overview can be found in Sippl [287]. Other statistical force field construction techniques are discussed in Bauer & Beyer <ref> [17] </ref> and Ulrich et al. [325]. The fact that the potential is now directly derived from geometric data implies that it automatically takes account of solvation and entropy corrections; on the other hand, one only gets a mean potential of less resolution.

Vajda & Delisi [327] use dynamic programming. Billeter <ref> [20] </ref> works with an ellipsoid algorithm. Branch and bound methods. Traditionally, see, e.g., Nemhauser & Wolsey [220], branch and bound methods are the method of choice for solving global optimization problems of a combinatorial nature, formulated as mixed integer programs.

NEUMAIER More generally, bounds on distances would allow one to combine the optimization approach to molecular modeling and the distance geometry approach surveyed in Crippen [65], Crippen & Havel [66] and Blaney & Dixon <ref> [24] </ref>. Steps in this direction are discussed in Crippen [64] and Scarsdale et al. [266]; they assume that further distance information is known about the molecule, e.g., from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.

Reference-contexts: To make full use of the resulting sparsity (which varies from iteration to iteration), efficient data structures must be maintained; see, e.g., Schreiber et al. [281]. More recently, fast multipole expansions <ref> [25, 120, 284] </ref> and variants [70, 91] of the Ewald method (Ewald [92]) were used as an alternative to cut-off methods, with a significant increase in quality York et al. [353, 354]. <p> One of the obvious difficulties is that because of the high dimension and the expensive evaluation of the potential, even local optimization is slow. (For large molecules, this is the case even when the potential calculations are speeded up using fast multipole expansions <ref> [25, 120, 284] </ref> or potential cutoffs.) The fastest optimization methods, the adopted basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) method and truncated Newton (TN) methods, employed, e.g., in CHARMM [33, 76], combine elements of New-ton's method with reduced subspace techniques to reduce storage requirements and 26 A.

Reference-contexts: Thus, unlike simulated annealing, successful tuning of genetic algorithms requires a considerable amount of insight into the nature of the problem at hand.

Both simulated annealing methods and genetic algorithms are, in their simpler forms, easy to understand and easy to implement, features that invite potential users of optimization methods to experiment with their own versions.

(For large molecules, this is the case even when the potential calculations are speeded up using fast multipole expansions [25, 120, 284] or potential cutoffs.) The fastest optimization methods, the adopted basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) method and truncated Newton (TN) methods, employed, e.g., in CHARMM <ref> [33, 76] </ref>, combine elements of New-ton's method with reduced subspace techniques to reduce storage requirements and 26 A. NEUMAIER to limit the amount of work done at each iteration. <p> For an adaptation of the truncated Newton optimization package TNPACK [274] to the molecular mechanics package CHARMM <ref> [33] </ref> see Derreumaux et al. [76]. However, since the objective function has a huge number of local minima, a local optimization is likely to get stuck before the global minimum is reached. Thus some kind of global search is needed to find the global minimum with some reliability.

Monge et al. [213] gains speed in a different way by assuming known secondary structure (cf. Section 7), that is frozen to limit the number of degrees of freedom. An important development concerns the numerical methods for solving stochastic differential equations, that at present are mostly explicit methods.

Reference-contexts: The Lennard-Jones cluster problem (a problem also of independent interest in applications) has extra symmetry. Hence more specialized techniques can be used (see, e.g., <ref> [224, 139, 57, 351] </ref>) that allow one to reach rather low lying minimizers even for a huge number of atoms ([350] reports calculations for up to 10 5 atoms). If one adds constraints for fixed bond lengths one gets the models discussed in Pardalos et al. [229].

Reference-contexts: Models used to study qualitative questions of statistical mechanics (e.g., Sali et al. Sali2) usually use a nearest neighbor cubic lattice (with coordination number 6). While these are occasionally used for structure prediction (e.g., Rabow & Scheraga [244], who also report inadequacies of the Miyazawa-Jernigan-Cowell <ref> [59] </ref> contact potential), a good representation of C ff C ff distances and angles requires at least a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice approximation (Covell & Jernigan [59] with coordination number 32 A. NEUMAIER 42). <p> While these are occasionally used for structure prediction (e.g., Rabow & Scheraga [244], who also report inadequacies of the Miyazawa-Jernigan-Cowell <ref> [59] </ref> contact potential), a good representation of C ff C ff distances and angles requires at least a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice approximation (Covell & Jernigan [59] with coordination number 32 A. NEUMAIER 42). More realistic approximations use a high coordination number of 56 (Kolinski et al. [171]) or 90, with a corresponding increase in combinatorial complexity which partially offsets the gain in evaluation speed. <p> Dill [46, 47] suggest that the formation of secondary structure is primarily due to the compact nature of folded proteins and not to the detailed form of the interaction. (But of course the detailed form will depend on it.) For some related results for tertiary structure see Covell & Jernigan <ref> [59] </ref>. Given the secondary structure, it is still a highly nontrivial task to derive the tertiary structure, i.e., the full protein geometry. See, e.g., Monge et al. [213]. Pattern recognition.

Reference-contexts: However, this is somewhat inadequate, and there have been a number of recent studies that treat the electrostatic effects due to the solvents by adding energy terms defined by so-called continuum solvation models. Two promising methods are in use (see Cramer & Truhlar <ref> [60] </ref> for a detailed, up-to-date review): Cheaper models are based on solvent-accessible surface area (Richmond [251], Wesson & Eisenberg [343], Schiffer et al.

[93]. To estimate the conformational entropy, Creighton <ref> [62] </ref>, p. 161, apparently only counts local minimizers, taking his intuition from simple random polymers where these minima can be assumed to be equidistributed with similar-sized catchment regions. For the much more complex energy surfaces of proteins, this assumption seems questionable. <p> People working in the field expect an exponential number of local minima. Estimates I have seen range from 1:4 n to 10 n for a protein with n residues; the highest estimate is from Creighton <ref> [62] </ref>, p. 161. <p> NEUMAIER and as left-handed helices if ' + &gt; 50 o (assuming for simplicity that the peptide bond dihedral angle ! is 180 o ). Actually several types of sheets and helices can be distinguished by a more careful classification (see, e.g., Creighton <ref> [62] </ref>, Table 5-2). Further geometrically recognizable local structures are reverse turns and bends, determined by appropriate (wide) ranges of two adjacent angle pairs ([62], Table 6-5). Other, irregular patterns are called coils.

Reference-contexts: Vibrations corresponding to bond-angle bending have frequencies of the order of 10 13 =sec. Non-vibrational internal motions are geometrically distinguishable at time scales of around 10 11 =sec Creighton <ref> [63] </ref>. These involve non-local changes and roughly correspond to lower frequency normal modes. <p> This is also supported by experiments that suggest that the approach to the global minimum proceeds in two phases, a rapid phase to reach a nearly folded state, followed by a lag period to complete the folding to the final state (Creighton <ref> [63] </ref>). The most natural explanation is the existence of a large barrier with many (but not too many or too deep) saddles around the valley containing the global minimum.

Reference-contexts: A way to model some global influence is by minimizing statistical potential functions where the residues are considered as unstructured units (Oobatake & Crippen [228], Crippen & Snow <ref> [67] </ref>); it should be possible to combine this approach with pattern recognition techniques. Another source of ambiguity is the lack of clear delineations of precisely which sets of geometries are classified to the various secondary structure labels; borderline geometries are interpreted differently by different experts.

Moreover, cross terms can drastically modify the global behavior, especially because of the nonlinearities in the non-bonded contributions, and if we ever want to obtain reliable quantitative predictions from global molecular mechanics calculations, these issues must be addressed much more carefully.

Reference-contexts: Under biological conditions, the bond lengths and bond angles are fairly rigid (with a standard deviation of less than 0:2 A for bond lengths and of about 2 o for bond angles, see Hendrickson [137]; recent experimental values are reported, e.g., in Engh & Huber <ref> [90] </ref>). Therefore, the dihedral angles along the backbone (usually labeled as in Figure 4) determine the main features of the final geometric shape of the folded protein.

Reference-contexts: Thus large flat minima (having a large catchment region) or large regions covered by many shallow local minima (corresponding to a glassy regime) are energetically more favorable than a narrow global minimum if this has only a slightly smaller potential. Some early calculations are reported by Farnell et al. <ref> [93] </ref>. To estimate the conformational entropy, Creighton [62], p. 161, apparently only counts local minimizers, taking his intuition from simple random polymers where these minima can be assumed to be equidistributed with similar-sized catchment regions. For the much more complex energy surfaces of proteins, this assumption seems questionable.

Reference-contexts: Also, the core of helices and their ends behave differently, the latter having a more varying range of angles associated with it. The high error rate of 30% makes it impossible to even roughly determine the shape of the protein in a reliable way; see, e.g., Garnier <ref> [104] </ref>. Moreover, even given the backbone positions, the reconstruction of the full geometry of a protein is still a nontrivial global optimization task (Lee & Subbiah [182], Dunback & MOLECULAR MODELING OF PROTEINS 35 Karplus).

In its original form, the simulated annealing method is provably convergent (in a probabilistic sense) but exceedingly slow; various ad hoc enhancements make it much faster. In particular, except for simple problems, success depends very much on the implementation used.

Reference-contexts: Therefore it is important to have independent ways of checking whether the structure found is likely to be the native structure or an artifact. Two recent studies addressing this with statistical potentials are Maiorov & Crippen [194], Hendlich et al. <ref> [136] </ref> and Casari & Sippl [45]. Threading. A different approach to ensure natural folding is to try to match known folding structures to amino acid sequences with unknown geometry.

Reference-contexts: Under biological conditions, the bond lengths and bond angles are fairly rigid (with a standard deviation of less than 0:2 A for bond lengths and of about 2 o for bond angles, see Hendrickson <ref> [137] </ref>; recent experimental values are reported, e.g., in Engh & Huber [90]). Therefore, the dihedral angles along the backbone (usually labeled as in Figure 4) determine the main features of the final geometric shape of the folded protein.

Reference-contexts: For less structured problems with more symmetries, like the problem of the optimal configuration for a cluster of n identical atoms with a Lennard-Jones interaction (11), the number of local minima appears to grow even more violently; an estimate by Hoare <ref> [139] </ref> is O (1:03 n 2 ). However, most of these local minima would have a large potential energy and thus be irrelevant for global optimization; the number of low-lying minima is more likely to grow simply exponential in n, too. <p> The Lennard-Jones cluster problem (a problem also of independent interest in applications) has extra symmetry. Hence more specialized techniques can be used (see, e.g., <ref> [224, 139, 57, 351] </ref>) that allow one to reach rather low lying minimizers even for a huge number of atoms ([350] reports calculations for up to 10 5 atoms). If one adds constraints for fixed bond lengths one gets the models discussed in Pardalos et al. [229].

Reference-contexts: However, details of the attractive term may change the nature of global opima; e.g., Hoare & McInnes <ref> [140] </ref> report that, for the simpler problem of inert gas crystals, softer Morse potentials favor regular crystals (that are believed to be the global optimum of the `true' potential). <p> However, most of these local minima would have a large potential energy and thus be irrelevant for global optimization; the number of low-lying minima is more likely to grow simply exponential in n, too. A remarkable observation of Hoare & McInnes <ref> [140] </ref> reveals that using in place of the Lennard-Jones pair interactions more realistic Morse functons gives cluster potentials with a much smaller number of local minima. Thus it may be that, also in the protein folding case, more realistic potentials will be easier to handle than current simpler models.

Related techniques based on backbone models with terms involving information from Ramachandran plots (see next section) are discussed in Dill et al. [79].

Reference-contexts: However, since the objective function has a huge number of local minima, a local optimization is likely to get stuck before the global minimum is reached. Thus some kind of global search is needed to find the global minimum with some reliability. Leach <ref> [180] </ref>, Scheraga [268], and Pardalos et al. [229] survey, from different perspectives, the different methods for global optimization that have been used so far on molecular conformation problems. <p> With more refined techniques for the construction of underestimating functions, there is hope for repeating the calculations without the need for such drastic simplifications. Many of the heuristic techniques used currently for searching the conformational space of molecules (see Leach <ref> [180] </ref> and Saunders et al. [265]) can be adapted to or combined with the branch and bound approach to take advantage of the structural insights of current chemistry.

Reference-contexts: There is some disagreement on how to assign the partial charges (see the discussion in Williams [345] Lee et al. <ref> [181] </ref>), and there is even some indication that, except for molecules with net charge, better results might be obtainable without such Coulomb terms Clark et al.

Reference-contexts: A little simpler is the constrained optimization problem known as side chain prediction. The task is to find the positions of the side chains of a protein, given the positions of the backbone atoms. See, e.g., Lee & Subbiah <ref> [182] </ref>, Tuff ery et al. [324], Dunback & Karplus [84, 85].

Secondary structure considerations have been, however, more successful in the converse problem of designing residue sequences that produce tertiary structures of prescribed form; see, e.g., Regan [249].

Reference-contexts: However, simple modifications of the potential energy function to take account of solvent screening and non-polar surface effects allow the correct discrimination between native and misfolded structure. Similarly, a computational study of LeGrand & Merz <ref> [183] </ref> reports severe distortions of the minimal energy configuration when the solvent is ignored. From an evolutionary point of view, the hypothesis of a single, well separated global minimum well is also very likely. <p> For a more detailed discussion of genetic algorithms in general see Davis [73]; for applications to protein folding see, e.g., Brodmeier & Pretsch [32], Kawai [164], Le Grand & Merz <ref> [183] </ref>, ShinJhon [285]. Both simulated annealing methods and genetic algorithms are, in their simpler forms, easy to understand and easy to implement, features that invite potential users of optimization methods to experiment with their own versions.

(Crude off-lattice models also appear to confirm this statement; see Irb ack et al. [153, 154].) It explains the so-called Levinthal paradox (Levinthal <ref> [186] </ref>) that the time a protein needs to fold is by far not large enough to explore even a tiny fraction of all local minima only.

Reference-contexts: To obtain only the low frequency eigenmodes, iterative methods like the Lanczos algorithm or subspace iteration can be used; see, e.g., Parlett [231]. The work can also be reduced by various approximations. Fixing bond lengths and bond angles removes the high frequency spectrum (Levitt et al. <ref> [187] </ref>, Gibrat et al. [108]).

Reference-contexts: To make the interatomic potential more realistic quantitatively, terms with other powers of R r are included in CHARMM. (For more in depth studies of pair potentials see Steele [303], Maitland <ref> [195] </ref>.)

Reference-contexts: However, the form of the best combination rules is not clear; e.g., Maple et al. <ref> [196] </ref> use instead the rule R 6 i + R 6 j . Thus R 0 &lt; R i + R j , i.e., the atoms overlap in their equilibrium position. (Some arguments for a particular combination rule are given in Slater & Kirkwood [297] Gilbert [111]. <p> reading between the lines of a number of standard texts on molecular mechanics) seems to be that in the past the available data were not sufficient to estimate the corresponding coefficients! However, cross terms lead to much better agreement with vibrational spectroscopy measurements (Derreumaux & Vergoten [75], Maple et al. <ref> [196] </ref>. Moreover, cross terms can drastically modify the global behavior, especially because of the nonlinearities in the non-bonded contributions, and if we ever want to obtain reliable quantitative predictions from global molecular mechanics calculations, these issues must be addressed much more carefully. <p> Maple et al. <ref> [196] </ref> add even some cubic interaction terms, and show that these significantly improve the fit to ab initio data. <p> A basic text is Giacovazzo [106]; specifically for proteins see, e.g., Zanotti [357], Fortier et al. [99]. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, (see, e.g., Jardetzky & Lane [157], Torda & van Gunsteren [320]), gives position data of proteins in solution. Ab initio quantum mechanical calculations <ref> [80, 98, 196, 211, 236] </ref> give energies, energy gradients, and even energy Hessians (i.e., second derivative matrices) at arbitrarily selected positions of the atoms, for molecules in the gas phase; Measurements of energy spectra give rather precise eigenvalues of the Hessian; Thermodynamical analysis gives specific heats, heats of formation, conforma-tional stability <p> The assessment of the sensitivity of the parameters with respect to the input data generally received very little attention. Maple et al. <ref> [196] </ref> mention the calculation of parameter uncertainties, but give no details on their magnitude. One reason for the importance of parameter uncertainties is that parameters with large uncertainties are unlikely to be transferable. Thacher et al. [318] discuss other applications of these sensitivities.

Reference-contexts: Therefore it seems impossible to attain the ideal of studying all features of the dynamics; in practice one must be content with the exploration of sample paths through the state space by means of so-called molecular dynamics calculations <ref> [26, 138, 142, 202] </ref>. <p> This shows that we are still very far away from a computational treatment of the dynamics of protein folding.

Reference: [205] <author> P. G. Mezey, </author> <title> Potential Energy Hypersurfaces, </title> <publisher> Elsevier, </publisher> <address> Amsterdam 1987. </address>
Reference-contexts: Even topological concepts like the Morse index (Mezey <ref> [205] </ref>) and invariants in knot theory (Jones polynomials) have been discussed in this context; see, e.g., Sumners [311]. An extensive recent report [218] from the U.S. <p> Here r 2 V (z) denotes the Hessian matrix of second derivatives of V at z.) A state transition thus proceeds from the neighborhood of one metastable state, passing near a transition state, and moving towards a neighboring metastable state. The book Mezey <ref> [205] </ref> contains a thorough treatment of the topology of potential energy surfaces, their stationary points and their catchment regions. In particular, it turns out that the transition states (saddle points) are stationary points of the potential whose Hessian has just one negative eigenvalue while the Hessian at metastable 10 A. <p> An apparently more reliable indicator of good folding is a low mean square distance between different configurations obtained in molecular simulations; see Irb ack et al. [153]. However, there are other possibilities: Quantum mechanical corrections accounting for vibrational zero-point energy might disfavor the global minimum state Mezey <ref> [205] </ref>, Slanina [296]. The main effect is that a slightly non-global minimum in a broader valley may be more highly populated than a global minimum in a valley with steep walls; cf. <p> equivalent to the incorporation of the conformational energy; the effects are quite similar.) In some cases as, e.g., for the molecule IHI the ab initio potential surface does not even have a finite local minimum, and the observed metastable state is close to a saddle point of the potential (cf. <ref> [205] </ref>, p.302). However, a remark in [296] suggests that so far there is no evidence that this difficulty occurs in organic molecules.

Reference-contexts: Without solvent, the tendency is almost reversed since oppositely charged groups now tend to form complementary pairs neutralizing the Coulomb forces. Typical qualitative studies (e.g., Miyazawa & Jernigan <ref> [206] </ref>) therefore use a (drastic) simplification by employing just two (or three) kinds of residues, polar, hydrophobic (and indifferent). Systematic studies of how the solvent changes the potential energy surface appear to be missing. However, a particularly striking illustration is given in Novotn y et al. [225].

Reference-contexts: The time-limiting step is provided by the task to drive the molten globule into one of the transition states to the native geometry. Experimental characterizations of molten globule states are discussed in Dobson [81] and Miranker & Dobson <ref> [207] </ref>. On the other hand, the studies mentioned disagree on many of the details, and the simplified drawings of the qualitative form of the potential energy surface are mutually incompatible between different schools. This shows that the interpretation of the literature on this point is difficult.

Reference-contexts: Two promising methods are in use (see Cramer & Truhlar [60] for a detailed, up-to-date review): Cheaper models are based on solvent-accessible surface area (Richmond [251], Wesson & Eisenberg [343], Schiffer et al.

Reference-contexts: The Lennard-Jones cluster problem (a problem also of independent interest in applications) has extra symmetry. Hence more specialized techniques can be used (see, e.g., <ref> [224, 139, 57, 351] </ref>) that allow one to reach rather low lying minimizers even for a huge number of atoms ([350] reports calculations for up to 10 5 atoms).

Reference-contexts: Systematic studies of how the solvent changes the potential energy surface appear to be missing. However, a particularly striking illustration is given in Novotn y et al. <ref> [225] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This is (approximately) realized in the force field used in <ref> [226, 271, 277] </ref>. Another defect of the dihedral angles (and similar remarks apply to improper torsion angles) is the fact that these angles are geometrically undetermined when a bond angle is 180 o ; the formulas then give the expression 0=0 for cos ! and sin !.

Reference-contexts: A way to model some global influence is by minimizing statistical potential functions where the residues are considered as unstructured units (Oobatake & Crippen <ref> [228] </ref>, Crippen & Snow [67]); it should be possible to combine this approach with pattern recognition techniques. Another source of ambiguity is the lack of clear delineations of precisely which sets of geometries are classified to the various secondary structure labels; borderline geometries are interpreted differently by different experts.

Reference-contexts: To obtain only the low frequency eigenmodes, iterative methods like the Lanczos algorithm or subspace iteration can be used; see, e.g., Parlett <ref> [231] </ref>. The work can also be reduced by various approximations. Fixing bond lengths and bond angles removes the high frequency spectrum (Levitt et al. [187], Gibrat et al. [108]). <p> Instead it can be held as a product of reflections and rotations, as obtained from the cheaper eigenvalue calculation. (This is usually done by tridiagonalization and subsequent use of the implicit QR algorithm; see e.g. Parlett <ref> [231] </ref>. There is a trade-off between storing the rotations from the QR iteration or recomputing them at the time of calculating S T g and later again for S (:::).) This also assures that the linear mapping Q determined in this way remains essentially orthogonal even in finite precision arithmetic.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, (see, e.g., Jardetzky & Lane [157], Torda & van Gunsteren [320]), gives position data of proteins in solution.

Reference-contexts: Implicit Euler-steps were studied in Peskin & Schlick <ref> [237] </ref>. The solution of the resulting implicit equations can be achieved by local optimization of a dynamical energy function (Schlick [272]); see Appendix 1 for more details.

Reference-contexts: If one adds constraints for fixed bond lengths one gets the models discussed in Pardalos et al. [229]. Even simpler are the `toy models' of Stillinger et al. [307], the bead models of Ferguson et al. [95], and the lattice models considered by Phillips & Rosen <ref> [238] </ref>. A survey of simplified models is given by Troyer & Cohen [321]. Some of the simplified models are accurate enough so that the resulting optimal structures resemble the real native structures, and still simple enough so that the global optimization by one of the methods discussed above appears feasible.

Reference-contexts: It should be possible to further increase the reliability of the methods by using a limited amount of global search in each optimization stage, though this appears not to have been done so far. A conceptually attractive smoothing technique is the diffusion equation method (Piela et al., <ref> [239] </ref>, Li & Scheraga [189]), where the original potential function V (x) is smeared out by artificial diffusion.

Reference-contexts: Thus one expects that at least the polypeptides realized as natural proteins have a single global minimum, separated from nearby local minima by a significant energy gap. Recently, however, a number of proteins called prions were discovered that exist in two different folded states in nature (Prusiner <ref> [240] </ref>). The normal form appears to be a metastable minimum only, separated by a huge barrier from the sick `scrapie' form in the global minimum.

Reference-contexts: initio approach (with second derivative information) poses interesting questions about multidimensional Hermite interpolation (or approximation) and the optimal choice of trial points for the quantum mechanical calculations; since the least squares problems are here linear, traditional methods for the optimal design of experiments (see, e.g., Atkinson [9], Atwood [10], Pukelsheim <ref> [241] </ref> and the books by Fedorov [94] or Silvey [286]) should lead to improved fits for the same amount of work. The assessment of the sensitivity of the parameters with respect to the input data generally received very little attention.

Reference-contexts: See, e.g., Monge et al. [213]. Pattern recognition. There have been a number of attempts to predict the secondary structure assignment directly from the sequence of amino acids, using pattern recognition techniques (often neural networks) trained on proteins with known geometric structure; see, e.g., <ref> [100, 108, 144, 169, 177, 242, 245, 316] </ref>. (The many traditional statistical techniques for pattern recognition see, e.g., Fukunaga [102], Young & Fu [355], have hardly been tried.)

Reference-contexts: MOLECULAR MODELING OF PROTEINS 21 Knowledge of such sensitivity information gives information on the quality of the model potential, and helps to assess the relative importance of the various terms in the potential; cf. Rabitz <ref> [243] </ref>. Together with the parameter uncertainties it also gives an idea of the accuracy obtainable in potential minimizations, and hence of the accuracy to which these minimizations are worth computing.

Reference-contexts: Models used to study qualitative questions of statistical mechanics (e.g., Sali et al. Sali2) usually use a nearest neighbor cubic lattice (with coordination number 6). While these are occasionally used for structure prediction (e.g., Rabow & Scheraga <ref> [244] </ref>, who also report inadequacies of the Miyazawa-Jernigan-Cowell [59] contact potential), a good representation of C ff C ff distances and angles requires at least a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice approximation (Covell & Jernigan [59] with coordination number 32 A. NEUMAIER 42).

Reference-contexts: Progress in algorithmic ingenuity and computer technology will push up the limit further. A recent survey of folding studies is Caflisch & Karplus [42]; see also Daggett & Levitt [69]. On the other hand, the experimentally accessible time resolution (see, e.g., Rad-ford & Dobson <ref> [246] </ref>) is of the order of milliseconds, and typical times observed experimentally for a protein to fold (in the absence of catalyzing enzymes) are in the order of ~ 10 1 10 3 seconds.

For applications to DNA supercoiling, see <ref> [275, 248] </ref>. An interesting possibility explored in Zhang & Schlick [358] is to combine the harmonic approach and the stochastic molecular dynamics approach to get a direct handle on the fast oscillations and simulate essentially the behavior on the slow modes.

Reference-contexts: Secondary structure considerations have been, however, more successful in the converse problem of designing residue sequences that produce tertiary structures of prescribed form; see, e.g., Regan <ref> [249] </ref>. But it is possible that the bad results reported are rather due to a too restrictive view of how to model local structure.

Reference-contexts: The main effect is that a slightly non-global minimum in a broader valley may be more highly populated than a global minimum in a valley with steep walls; cf. Richards <ref> [250] </ref>. (Possibly taking account of these corrections is equivalent to the incorporation of the conformational energy; the effects are quite similar.)

Currently, the best methods predict the correct assignment in only about 70% of the positions (Rost & Sander <ref> [255] </ref>). The missing 30% are, according to current interpretation, mainly due to global influences; a simple estimate in [282] shows that most subsequences of 8 or fewer residues must be expected to give rise to more than one possible secondary structure sequence.

Reference-contexts: The most natural explanation is the existence of a large barrier with many (but not too many or too deep) saddles around the valley containing the global minimum. For example, Sali et al. <ref> [260] </ref> discuss a (lattice) scenario where the global minimum is well separated in energy from the other local minima, and the number of transition states leading to the global minimum is large, thus favoring the formation of the folded state from many less compact nearly folded states. <p> More recent studies (Karplus et al.

Reference-contexts: With more refined techniques for the construction of underestimating functions, there is hope for repeating the calculations without the need for such drastic simplifications. Many of the heuristic techniques used currently for searching the conformational space of molecules (see Leach [180] and Saunders et al. <ref> [265] </ref>) can be adapted to or combined with the branch and bound approach to take advantage of the structural insights of current chemistry. <p> See also Anet [6].) Since no near global minimum will be missed, calculation of the entropy contributions (12), (13) will allow finding the global minimum of the Gibbs free energy, that is more likely to match the true folded state. See Saunders et al. <ref> [265] </ref> for a performance study of several methods for finding most (or perhaps even all) low-lying local minima of a cycloheptadecane potential.

Reference-contexts: NEUMAIER More generally, bounds on distances would allow one to combine the optimization approach to molecular modeling and the distance geometry approach surveyed in Crippen [65], Crippen & Havel [66] and Blaney & Dixon [24]. Steps in this direction are discussed in Crippen [64] and Scarsdale et al. <ref> [266] </ref>; they assume that further distance information is known about the molecule, e.g., from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In the absence of such detailed experimental information, the most likely candidates for a further significant reduction are constraints for the dihedral angles along the backbone. <p> The same holds for the construction of Cartesian coordinates from distance data obtained by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Scarsdale et al. <ref> [266] </ref>, Torda & van Gunsteren [320]) by finding the global minimum of a weighted sum V dc = i;k c ik (kx i x k k 3 r 3 to find the Cartesian coordinates that best match a set of measured distances r ik .

Reference-contexts: For the much more complex energy surfaces of proteins, this assumption seems questionable. Go & Scheraga [118] (see also Scheraga <ref> [268] </ref>, who surveys alternative approaches to entropy, too) use second derivative information on all nearly global minima (at x (1) ; x (2) ; : : :) to approximate the conformational entropy of a minimum at x (m) by S m = k B log p m + k B log <p> However, since the objective function has a huge number of local minima, a local optimization is likely to get stuck before the global minimum is reached. Thus some kind of global search is needed to find the global minimum with some reliability. Leach [180], Scheraga <ref> [268] </ref>, and Pardalos et al. [229] survey, from different perspectives, the different methods for global optimization that have been used so far on molecular conformation problems.

Reference-contexts: Two promising methods are in use (see Cramer & Truhlar [60] for a detailed, up-to-date review): Cheaper models are based on solvent-accessible surface area (Richmond [251], Wesson & Eisenberg [343], Schiffer et al. <ref> [270] </ref>); cf. Appendix 2. <p> The free energy of solvation can also be accounted for by terms proportional to the surface area exposed to the solvent; see, e.g., Wesson & Eisenberg [343] Perrot et al. [235], Scheraga [269] and Schiffer et al. <ref> [270] </ref>. See also the molecular surface review by Conolly [56]. Possibly, the solvation energy can also be accounted for by modifications of the pair potentials and the combination rules; see Appendix 2.

Reference-contexts: Implicit Euler-steps were studied in Peskin & Schlick [237]. The solution of the resulting implicit equations can be achieved by local optimization of a dynamical energy function (Schlick <ref> [272] </ref>); see Appendix 1 for more details. Since the high frequencies are damped, this approach is suitable for macroscopic models where the high frequencies are absent, or virtually uncoupled, from the slow modes. For applications to DNA supercoiling, see [275, 248].

Reference-contexts: To make full use of the resulting sparsity (which varies from iteration to iteration), efficient data structures must be maintained; see, e.g., Schreiber et al. <ref> [281] </ref>. More recently, fast multipole expansions [25, 120, 284] and variants [70, 91] of the Ewald method (Ewald [92]) were used as an alternative to cut-off methods, with a significant increase in quality York et al.

Reference-contexts: pattern recognition techniques (often neural networks) trained on proteins with known geometric structure; see, e.g., [100, 108, 144, 169, 177, 242, 245, 316]. (The many traditional statistical techniques for pattern recognition see, e.g., Fukunaga [102], Young & Fu [355], have hardly been tried.) However, success was rather limited; see Schulz <ref> [282] </ref> and Stolorz et al. [309] for critical evaluations of the state of affairs in 1988 and 1991, but also Rose & Creamer [254] for a more (and most likely too) optimistic perspective for the future. <p> Currently, the best methods predict the correct assignment in only about 70% of the positions (Rost & Sander [255]). The missing 30% are, according to current interpretation, mainly due to global influences; a simple estimate in <ref> [282] </ref> shows that most subsequences of 8 or fewer residues must be expected to give rise to more than one possible secondary structure sequence.

Reference-contexts: Modifications to take account of the rigid structure of bond lengths and bond angles are discussed in Kostrowicki & Scheraga [174]. Similar techniques for smoothing have been proposed and applied to potential energy surfaces by Coleman et al. [55], More e & Wu [214, 215], Shalloway <ref> [283] </ref> and Wu [349]. A different smoothing technique is proposed in Dill et al. [79]. They construct a surrogate potential surface by fitting an underestimating function to known local optima, hoping that the global optimum lies near the minimizer of this surrogate function.

(For large molecules, this is the case even when the potential calculations are speeded up using fast multipole expansions <ref> [25, 120, 284] </ref> or potential cutoffs.) The fastest optimization methods, the adopted basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) method and truncated Newton (TN) methods, employed, e.g., in CHARMM [33, 76], combine elements of New-ton's method with reduced subspace techniques to reduce storage requirements and 26 A.

Reference-contexts: In particular, except for simple problems, success depends very much on the implementation used. For results of simulated annealing techniques for protein structure prediction see, e.g., Kawai [164], Shin & Jhon <ref> [285] </ref>. Genetic algorithms. Introduced by Holland [143], genetic algorithms make use of analogies to biological evolution by allowing mutations and crossing over between candidates for good local optima in the hope to derive even better ones. At each stage, a whole population of configurations are stored. <p> For a more detailed discussion of genetic algorithms in general see Davis [73]; for applications to protein folding see, e.g., Brodmeier & Pretsch [32], Kawai [164], Le Grand & Merz [183], ShinJhon <ref> [285] </ref>. Both simulated annealing methods and genetic algorithms are, in their simpler forms, easy to understand and easy to implement, features that invite potential users of optimization methods to experiment with their own versions.

Reference-contexts: about multidimensional Hermite interpolation (or approximation) and the optimal choice of trial points for the quantum mechanical calculations; since the least squares problems are here linear, traditional methods for the optimal design of experiments (see, e.g., Atkinson [9], Atwood [10], Pukelsheim [241] and the books by Fedorov [94] or Silvey <ref> [286] </ref>) should lead to improved fits for the same amount of work. The assessment of the sensitivity of the parameters with respect to the input data generally received very little attention. Maple et al. [196] mention the calculation of parameter uncertainties, but give no details on their magnitude.

Reference-contexts: An apparently more reliable indicator of good folding is a low mean square distance between different configurations obtained in molecular simulations; see Irb ack et al. [153]. However, there are other possibilities: Quantum mechanical corrections accounting for vibrational zero-point energy might disfavor the global minimum state Mezey [205], Slanina <ref> [296] </ref>. The main effect is that a slightly non-global minimum in a broader valley may be more highly populated than a global minimum in a valley with steep walls; cf. <p> However, a remark in <ref> [296] </ref> suggests that so far there is no evidence that this difficulty occurs in organic molecules. The folded state might be a metastable state with high energy barriers, or it might just be the lowest local minimizer that is kinetically accessible from most of the state space.

Reference-contexts: To make the interatomic potential more realistic quantitatively, terms with other powers of R r are included in CHARMM. (For more in depth studies of pair potentials see Steele <ref> [303] </ref>, Maitland [195].) It is quite possible that more accurate potentials will also need to take three-body forces into account, such as those given by so-called Axilrod-Teller terms, predicted by quantum mechanics (Axilrod & Teller [11], Kihara & Ichimaru [165]).

Reference-contexts: To speed up the potential evaluation, the potential is further modified by introducing a cutoff distance beyond which the interatomic potential is neglected. (Recent evaluations of the effect of cut-offs on molecular dynamics simulation include Smith & Pettit [299], Steinbach & Brooks <ref> [304] </ref> and Schreiber & Steinhauser [278, 279, 280].) With such a cutoff, only a small part of the O (n 2 ) terms in the last sum in the potential of Table 1 need to be calculated.

Trivial restrictions that can be used are two-sided bounds on bond lengths and bond angles, and lower bounds on contact distances of arbitrary pairs. The bounds can be implemented either as hard bounds (via constraints) or as soft bounds (via penalty terms).

Reference-contexts: Two promising methods are in use (see Cramer & Truhlar [60] for a detailed, up-to-date review): Cheaper models are based on solvent-accessible surface area (Richmond [251], Wesson & Eisenberg <ref> [343] </ref>, Schiffer et al. [270]); cf. Appendix 2. <p> The free energy of solvation can also be accounted for by terms proportional to the surface area exposed to the solvent; see, e.g., Wesson & Eisenberg <ref> [343] </ref> Perrot et al. [235], Scheraga [269] and Schiffer et al. [270]. See also the molecular surface review by Conolly [56]. Possibly, the solvation energy can also be accounted for by modifications of the pair potentials and the combination rules; see Appendix 2. <p> If we could find a phenomenological description of the reduced potential V (x), the solvent would not need to be considered explicitly. Wesson & Eisenberg <ref> [343] </ref> suggest that the solvation energy could be approximately modeled by adding to the potential V mol (x) of the molecule in isolation additional terms proportional to the surface area exposed to the solvent.

Reference-contexts: For very general energy minimization problems, combinatorial difficulty (NP-hardness) can be proved by showing that the traveling salesman problem can be phrased as a minimization of the sum of two-body interaction energies (Wille & Vennik <ref> [344] </ref>), but the potential is very contrived, and the result implies nothing for more realistic situations.

Reference-contexts: NEUMAIER Currently, entropy considerations are often addressed computationally in a qualitative fashion only, using very simple (e.g., lattice) models together with techniques from statistical mechanics. A survey of typical results obtainable in that way, and many further references on the statistical mechanics approach, are given in Wolynes <ref> [347] </ref>. Entropy of mixing with the solvent is another term that may play a role; see Chen et al. [49].

This last situation corresponds to what physicists refer to as glassy behavior (see the statistical dynamics treatment surveyed in Wolynes <ref> [347] </ref> and references there), and there are some indications from molecular dynamics simulations (Elber & Karplus [89], Honeycutt & Thirumalai [146]) that this might be the situation in typical energy surfaces of proteins.

A different smoothing technique is proposed in Dill et al. [79]. They construct a surrogate potential surface by fitting an underestimating function to known local optima, hoping that the global optimum lies near the minimizer of this surrogate function.

Reference-contexts: The Lennard-Jones cluster problem (a problem also of independent interest in applications) has extra symmetry. Hence more specialized techniques can be used (see, e.g., <ref> [224, 139, 57, 351] </ref>) that allow one to reach rather low lying minimizers even for a huge number of atoms ([350] reports calculations for up to 10 5 atoms). If one adds constraints for fixed bond lengths one gets the models discussed in Pardalos et al. [229].
