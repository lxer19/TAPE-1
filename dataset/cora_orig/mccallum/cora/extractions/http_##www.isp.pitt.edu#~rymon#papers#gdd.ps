Abstract: In many diagnosis-and-repair domains, diagnostic reasoning cannot be abstracted from repair actions, nor from actions necessary to obtain information of diagnostic value. TraumAID 2.0, a consultation system for multiple trauma management, implements a reasoning architecture for exploratory-corrective domains which integrates diagnostic reasoning with planning and action. Taking the view that a diagnosis is only worthwhile to the extent that it can affect repair decisions, its Goal-Directed Diagnosis (GDD) framework views the diagnosis-object as secondary to the formation of appropriate goals for a complementary planner. We start this article with a specific case of multiple trauma injury. Demonstrating some of the key features of exploratory-corrective domains, we use this case to exemplify the suitability of our approach. Before focusing on the GDD reasoner itself, we overview TraumAID 2.0's Exploratory-Corrective Management architecture in which it is embedded with a companion planner, and explain its iterative interaction with the physician. The paper's main body presents GDD's formalism, and knowledge representation scheme, and proposes a design methodology for GDD-based systems (The companion planner, and the implemented system are described elsewhere). Before concluding, we present a set of strategies characteristic of exploratory-corrective domains, and argue the suitability of our framework for their implementation. fl Current address for correspondence: Intelligent Systems Program, University of Pitts-burgh, 901 Cathedral of Learning, Pittsburgh, PA 15260; E-mail: rymon@isp.pitt.edu; WWW: http://www.isp.pitt.edu/~rymon.

Reference-contexts: Presented not as a theory of diagnosis but as a theory of repair planning, their work applies Winslett's possible-models planning approach [55] to a diagnostic domain. Sun and Weld use uwl, a strips-like language, in an approach which integrates gde-style diagnosis [13] and strips-style planning <ref> [17] </ref>. The link between diagnosis and repair planning in real applications is also emphasized by Pepper and Kahn [40]. Also related, although to a lesser extent, is work by Rushby and Crow [47] who formalize reconfiguration, a form of repair, using an extension of Re-iter's theory of diagnosis [46, 14].

Reference-contexts: Localization is often domain-specific, and one may therefore have to rely on an expert's intimate knowledge of the domain. The use of localized strategies is a simple matter of divide-and-conquer and so it can also accommodate automatically generated sub-plans (as in <ref> [18, 32, 56] </ref>), as well as combinations of automatically generated sub-plans and explicitly specified sub-strategies. An important distinction of our local strategies is that while inference-responses are explicitly specified in GDD rules, action-responses are not. Instead, a local strategy's GDD rules are used to specify goal-responses.

Reference-contexts: Some sequential frameworks use a cost measure to model the effect of actions. However, as noted by Genesereth <ref> [23] </ref>, this approach is too simplistic. In our work, rather than worrying about more accurate models of action, we claim that diagnostic research can simply rely on properly integrating planning research.

Reference-contexts: Ginsberg's Multi-Valued Logics (MVL) is a formal framework for inference in which each proposition is assigned not only a truth value, corresponding to the strength of belief in that proposition being true or false, but also a knowledge assessment, measuring roughly the amount of knowledge used in deriving this belief <ref> [24] </ref>. Bilattices in which one partial order corresponds to the truthfulness measure and the other to the knowledge assessment are used in MVL as domains. The first formalization of GDD [48] used a three-valued logic in which each proposition was assigned a true, false, or unknown belief. <p> Besides fitting our needs, we believe that the specialized theory may be useful for others wishing to convert other rule-based systems to MVL. While the material presented next is self-contained, the reader is referred to <ref> [24] </ref> for a more complete coverage of MVL. 4.2 Attitude and Belief As mentioned, throughout the whole diagnosis-and-repair process, the GDD reasoner maintains and updates an attitude and a belief for a set of propositional statements. <p> The extreme points in the belief bilattice are labeled T and F, whereas same points are labeled R (for relevant) and I (for irrelevant) in the attitude bilattice. Extensions to more complex bilattices, in which defaults can be represented are discussed in <ref> [24, 50] </ref>. 8 Given the features of a certain domain, it may conceivably be useful to choose an attitude bilattice that is more or less expressive than the belief bilattice. 14 4.3 Interpreting an Attitude-Belief Assignment Throughout all stages of a given diagnosis-and-repair session, an attitude-belief value is assigned to all <p> Solving a diagnostic problem (Section 5.4) requires that we compute an inferential closure of the observations given the evidential and goal-setting rules. The basic form of inference, presented next, is simpler and more intuitive than the one advocated by Ginsberg in <ref> [24] </ref>. In Section 5.3, we extend it to a form closer to Ginsberg's in order to support reasoning about contradictory information. <p> In <ref> [24] </ref>, the full first-order formulation of MVL assigns to a statement a truth-value that combines the results of all possible proofs for that statement and its negation. Theoretically, such determination may be undecidable; in practice, it may often be intractable, or at least very expensive.

In related work, Long et al. <ref> [35] </ref> suggest a framework in which, to devise treatment, explicitly represented causal chains are traversed until a treatable cause is encountered; this latter cause is then treated. 7.7 Causing new problems Treatment, e.g. a drug, for a given problem may itself cause another problem, which should then be addressed.

Reference-contexts: Utility theory tells us that for such a decision to be optimal, it should maximize the expected utility as measured by preferences over possible outcomes. Indeed, utilities have been used extensively in medical decision making (see <ref> [27, 39] </ref> for an excellent review). Following are a few strategies in which probabilistic and utility-based considerations seem to be involved: * Gamble on best scenario | Consider a patient presenting unconscious from shock with a suspected pericardial tamponade and/or lacerated abdominal aorta.

In this paper, we focus on a formalization of TraumAID 2.0's GDD-based reasoning component. For description of other parts of the system, the interested reader is referred to <ref> [49, 50, 54] </ref>. TraumAID 2.0 was originally implemented in Common-Lisp on a Symbolics platform, and was recently ported by Jonathan Kaye to a Sun-based X-windows environment as 9 well as to a Macintosh platform. <p> The new system currently consists of some 685 rules, out of which 184 are goal-setting rules (cf. Section 5). Its planner can address 128 different goals, with a vocabulary of 95 different procedures (small plans), and 104 different actions (cf. <ref> [49] </ref>). On the Sun platform, each cycle of diagnostic reasoning and planning takes an average of about a second or two. session for JR's case. The two Given windows, at the top right, detail all information provided by the physician, voluntarily, or in response to TraumAID 2.0's plans. <p> TraumAID 2.0's planner, using a selection-and-ordering plan sketching algorithm <ref> [49] </ref>, is one planner that satisfies the above requirements. Next, we first introduce goal inhibition a macro mechanism useful in encoding local strategies and some of the interaction of these strategies. We then discuss, and present an example of the encoding of local strategies. <p> Again, the interested reader is referred to <ref> [49, 50] </ref> for details about the ECM planner. 6.3.1 Combining in the Goal-Level Many times, local strategies can be combined at the goal level, without having to reason about possible choices of action for these goals. <p> The key in the GDD formalization (Section 4, and 5) is that explicit representation and reasoning about goals can facilitate focusing on worthy activity. Goals also serve as a natural interface with the companion planner, which is described elsewhere <ref> [49, 50] </ref>. We have also presented a design methodology for GDD-based systems (Section 6) in which explicitly encoded local strategies are implicitly merged by a mediating planner. 40 2.

In Section 5.3, we show this to be useful in explicitly representing and reasoning about contradictory information. In <ref> [50] </ref>, we outline an extension which facilitates reasoning with defaults. In this new formalization of GDD, each proposition is assigned a value drawn from the cross product of two bilattices: one representing belief, the other representing attitude. <p> The extreme points in the belief bilattice are labeled T and F, whereas same points are labeled R (for relevant) and I (for irrelevant) in the attitude bilattice.

TraumAID 1.0, the first generation of this program (developed between 1984-88), was a strictly rule-based program. In an empirical study, in its limited domain, TraumAID 1.0 was found to outperform surgical residents, albeit not experienced surgeons [5, 6, 7]. <p> Each consultation session in TraumAID 2.0 consists of several such cycles.

Reference-contexts: Localization is often domain-specific, and one may therefore have to rely on an expert's intimate knowledge of the domain. The use of localized strategies is a simple matter of divide-and-conquer and so it can also accommodate automatically generated sub-plans (as in <ref> [18, 32, 56] </ref>), as well as combinations of automatically generated sub-plans and explicitly specified sub-strategies. An important distinction of our local strategies is that while inference-responses are explicitly specified in GDD rules, action-responses are not. Instead, a local strategy's GDD rules are used to specify goal-responses.
