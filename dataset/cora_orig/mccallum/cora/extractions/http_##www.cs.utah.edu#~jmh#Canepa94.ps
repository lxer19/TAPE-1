Abstract: A new method for kinematic calibration of a robot is presented, based on triaxial measurement of acceleration by a sensor fixed to the robot end-point. The kinematic parameters are evaluated by means of a series of simple tests (two for each joint). In these tests each joint, except the one under consideration, is kept fixed. Acceleration and encoder output are then acquired. Simulations and experimental results applied on Sarcos Dextrous Arm are presented to verify this method.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents a method to calibrate a 7 degree of freedom (DOF) robotic arm using a triaxial accelerometer. An open-loop calibration procedure, Circle Point Analysis (CPA) <ref> [1, 2] </ref>, is followed to determinate the kinematic parameters of the Sarcos Dextrous Arm (Sarcos Research Corp., Salt Lake City, Utah). Advantages in the use of inertial sensors, compared to external position sensing systems, include lower cost and lack of viewing or access constraints.

This arm is hydraulically actuated and is furnished with its first 5 links equipped with encoders with interpolation boxes capable of a resolution of 400,000 counts per revolution. The arm is controlled by means of a controller that can be used both in local and remote modes.

Reference-contexts: We are right now in the process of implementing these improvements. With regard to the model of the arm, it should be possible to implement a more complicated one including mechanical geometrical imperfections like link compliance and robot base motion <ref> [5] </ref>. In the future this work will be extended to the estimation, by means of a triaxial accelerometer of both kinematic and inertial parameters.
