Abstract: Unlike static networks, ad-hoc networks have no spatial hierarchy and suffer from frequent link failures which prevent mobile hosts from using traditional routing schemes. Under these conditions, mobile hosts must find routes to destinations without the use of designated routers and also must dynamically adapt the routes to the current link conditions. This paper proposes a distributed adaptive routing protocol for finding and maintaining stable routes based on signal strength and location stability in an ad-hoc network and presents an architecture for its implementation.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 presents our simulation results. The final section presents conclusions and some directions for future work. 2 Background and Related Work Traditionally, next-hop routing protocols have been classified into distance-vector and link-state approaches. Distance vector protocols, like RIP <ref> [1] </ref>, are based on the distributed Bellman-Ford (DBF) algorithm and rely on maintaining distance estimates to all nodes in the network. Each node monitors the cost of its outgoing links and periodically broadcasts, to its neighbors, its minimum distance estimate to each destination in the network.

Reference-contexts: Although the storage requirements are minimal, the DBF algorithm may converge very slowly and may require a large number of messages to respond to a topology change <ref> [2] </ref>. In link-state protocols, like OSPF [3], each node maintains the shortest-path tree to all nodes in the network which it uses to make routing decisions. Updates are broadcast to maintain consistent views of the network at each node.

Reference-contexts: Updates are broadcast to maintain consistent views of the network at each node. The maintenance of a view of the entire network involves large storage and communication overhead. Both mechanisms rely on exchanging detailed information amongst the nodes in the network <ref> [4] </ref>. These traditional routing algorithms, which depend on hierarchical addressing schemes and pass detailed routing information between designated 2 routers, are not effective in ad-hoc networks due to the high rate of topology change [5], [6], [7].

Reference-contexts: One type of ad-hoc routing method seeks to modify existing DBF routing algorithms for use in a dynamic topology. The Destination Sequenced Distance Vector (DSDV) algorithm, <ref> [8] </ref>, modifies the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm to prevent looping by including sequence numbers to order the routing information. It also delays the advertisement of unstable routes to reduce fluctuations of the routing tables and the number of rebroadcasts of same sequence route entries.

Reference-contexts: It also delays the advertisement of unstable routes to reduce fluctuations of the routing tables and the number of rebroadcasts of same sequence route entries. The Wireless Routing Protocol (WRP), <ref> [9] </ref>, uses a path-finding algorithm that includes second-to-last hop to a destination to identify a route and prevent temporary looping. The approach presented in [10] finds and maintains clusters in the ad-hoc network. The boundary nodes connect clusters and perform routing using a traditional distance vector routing protocol.

Reference-contexts: Information is propagated through the network to achieve this goal. Another type of ad-hoc routing algorithms uses an on-demand route discovery philosophy. Routes to a destination are sought only if the node has data to send to that destination. The Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) proposed in <ref> [11] </ref> uses broadcasts to propagate the route-search, and each node which forwards the route-search adds its address to the source list. When the request reaches the destination a complete route is listed in the packet.

Reference-contexts: Routes discovered in this way or by hearing neighboring hosts' communications are recorded in the cache. Data packets are forwarded by placing the source route (hop-list) in the packet. The Lightweight Mobile Routing (LMR) approach proposed in <ref> [12] </ref> floods the network with a query broadcast when the route is desired. The nodes receiving this query broadcast either broadcast a reply with the requested route if this node has a route to the requested destination or, otherwise, simply forward the broadcast query.

Reference-contexts: This approach uses link status to create routes and prevent looping. Route erasure is required when the topology changes. The Associativity Based Routing (ABR) approach, <ref> [13] </ref>, also uses broadcast queries to find desired routes, but the optimal route is selected by the destination based on the stability of the route and shortest path.
