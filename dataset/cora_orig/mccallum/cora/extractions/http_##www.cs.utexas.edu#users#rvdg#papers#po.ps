Abstract: This paper is concerned with the parallel implementation of the boundary element method and its application to exterior acoustical scattering problem. The numerical implementation is based on a Galerkin-type formulation of a Burton-Miller integral equation proposed in [4, 10]. This scheme can avoid sensitive properties of hypersingular integration, simplify the numerical implementation, and improve the quality of the numerical solutions, especially in the range of high frequencies. An a posteriori error estimate proposed in [4] is implemented. In essence, a complete parallel implementation of the boundary element method, including the parallel formation of the linear system, a parallel dense solver, and a parallel algorithm for postprocessing (error estimation), are presented in this paper.
