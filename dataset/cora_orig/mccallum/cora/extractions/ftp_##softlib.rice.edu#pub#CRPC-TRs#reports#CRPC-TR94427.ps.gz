Abstract: The Netlib repository, maintained by the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, contains freely available software, documents, and databases of interest to the numerical, scientific computing, and other communities. This report includes both the Netlib User's Guide and the Netlib System Manager's Guide, and contains information about Netlib's databases, interfaces, and system implementation. The Netlib repository's databases include the Performance Database, the Conferences Database, and the NA-NET mail forwarding and Whitepages databases. A variety of user interfaces enable users to access the Netlib repository in the manner most convenient and compatible with their networking capabilities. These interfaces include the Netlib email interface, the Xnetlib X Windows client, the netlibget command-line TCP/IP client, anonymous ftp, anonymous rcp, and gopher.

Reference-contexts: The benchmark data are presented in a way that is devoid of any subjective interpretations of machine performance. The Performance Database allows all branches of the computing community to archive performance metrics and make them readily available to the public. For further details, see <ref> [1] </ref>. The performance data are stored in the performance directory in the Netlib repository. Although it is possible to download performance data using anonymous ftp or rcp, the Performance button on the Xnetlib X Windows client provides browsing and keyword searching mechanisms, as well as formatted display of the data. <p> The Conferences Database contains conference and meeting announcements entered by UT staff and by Xnetlib users. Clicking on Performance takes you into the Performance Database mode. This mode gives you access to benchmark performance data for a wide range of machines. For more information, see <ref> [1] </ref>. 16 2.2.6 Command Line Options Xnetlib understands the normal X Toolkit options (-display, -rv, etc.) as well as -help, and those listed below next to the X resources they affect.

Reference-contexts: Clicking on Classifications lists library topics (Figure 6). The classification is an augmentation of the top level of the GAMS hierarchy. For more information about GAMS, see <ref> [2] </ref>. Selecting one of these topics displays a subset of the main library list. Clicking on Search takes you into search mode . Buttons for the various types of searches are displayed, along with an explanation of these search types in the main window.

Reference-contexts: At UT/ORNL, the SVD is done periodically on a matrix constructed from the netlib index files to produce a semantic space for the netlib repository. The keyword-lsi service invoked from nlrexecd carries out retrieval. For more information about LSI, see <ref> [3] </ref>. The particular LSI technique currently used in Xnetlib is patented and proprietary and may be used only with the written permission of Bell Communications Research. 8.6.3 Whois Service The nlrexecd whois service does a lookup on the NA-NET WhitepagesDatabase, augmented by the SIAM Membership List.

Reference-contexts: Netlib sends, by return electronic mail, requested routines together with subsidiary routines and any requested documents or test programs suppled by the software authors [5]. Xnetlib, a recently developed interactive tool for software and document distribution <ref> [4] </ref>, uses an X Window interface and TCP/IP connections to allow users to receive replies to their requests within a matter of seconds. The interface provides a number of modes and searching mechanisms to facilitate searching through a large distributed collection of software and documents.

Reference-contexts: Introduction Netlib began in 1985 to fill a need for cost-effective, timely distribution of high-quality mathematical software to the research community. Netlib sends, by return electronic mail, requested routines together with subsidiary routines and any requested documents or test programs suppled by the software authors <ref> [5] </ref>. Xnetlib, a recently developed interactive tool for software and document distribution [4], uses an X Window interface and TCP/IP connections to allow users to receive replies to their requests within a matter of seconds.

Reference-contexts: Software routines from a variety of sources are currently available from Netlib. Some of the libraries Netlib distributes such as EISPACK, LINPACK, FFTPACK, LAPACK, algorithms from the ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, and algorithms from the book by Forsythe, Malcolm, and Moler <ref> [6] </ref> have long been used as important tools in scientific computation and are widely recognized to be of high quality.
Reference: [7] <author> E. Grosse. </author> <title> Repository mirroring. </title> <note> (submitted for publication), </note> <month> Sept. </month> <year> 1993. </year>
Reference-contexts: The site holding the master copy may be different for different files. Netlib has adopted a low overhead repository mirroring scheme, based on checksum files and ftp, that keeps slave copies of files consistent with the master copies. For more information on this repository mirroring mechanism, see <ref> [7] </ref>. 4.1 Netlib Index File Format Netlib is intended to be not just a warehouse but a library, and for that it must have adequate search tools.
