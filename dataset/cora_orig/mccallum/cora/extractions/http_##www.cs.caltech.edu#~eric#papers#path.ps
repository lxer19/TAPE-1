Abstract: We present algorithms to count paths and cycles of a given length in a directed graph. The algorithms have time complexity O(2 n poly n) and space complexity O(poly n).

Reference-contexts: Karp [3] developed an inclusion and exclusion algorithm to count Hamiltonian paths. There are also inclusion and exclusion algorithms to count all paths and all cycles <ref> [1] </ref>. All these algorithms have time complexity O (2 n poly n) and space complexity O (poly n). In this paper, algorithms are developed from finite-difference formulas, which are a generalization of inclusion and exclusion formulas [2].

Reference-contexts: All these algorithms have time complexity O (2 n poly n) and space complexity O (poly n). In this paper, algorithms are developed from finite-difference formulas, which are a generalization of inclusion and exclusion formulas <ref> [2] </ref>. The principle of inclusion and exclusion does not apply directly to the problems considered here, but the finite-difference approach produces the algorithms in a straightforward fashion. We begin with a brief discussion of finite-difference formulas for the multi-linear terms of polynomials. <p> A proof of this property is given in <ref> [2] </ref>. Intuitively, each D j acts as a derivative with respect to x j , so the composition D 1 D n finds the derivative with respect to every variable. Since the polynomial's terms have degree n or less, each term other than the multilinear term lacks some variable.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Special cases of the problems of counting paths and cycles of a specific length include the problems of counting Hamiltonian paths and cycles. Karp <ref> [3] </ref> developed an inclusion and exclusion algorithm to count Hamiltonian paths. There are also inclusion and exclusion algorithms to count all paths and all cycles [1]. All these algorithms have time complexity O (2 n poly n) and space complexity O (poly n).
