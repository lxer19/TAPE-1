Abstract: Previous literature on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) assumed that the sites to be visited are stationary. Motivated by practical applications, we introduce a time-dependent generalization of TSP which we call Moving-Target TSP, where a pursuer must intercept in minimum time a set of targets which move with constant velocities. We propose approximate and exact algorithms for several natural variants of Moving-Target TSP. Our implementation is available on the Web.

Reference-contexts: One major drawback of such general formulations is that they do not yield efficient bounded-cost heuristics, since they generalize TSP without the triangle inequality, which admits no efficient approximation bounds unless P = N P <ref> [1] </ref>. ?

Reference-contexts: There are several different heuristics for the Multiprocessor Scheduling Problem: list scheduling, longest processing, and many others, including a polynomial-time approximation scheme <ref> [3] </ref>. Unfortunately, the error estimates for these heuristics cannot be transformed into bounds for Moving-Target TSP with Resupply and multiple pursuers because a multiplicative factor corresponds to the exponent in such transformations.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The classical Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been studied extensively, and many TSP heuristics have been proposed over the years (see surveys such as <ref> [4] </ref> [7]). Previous works on TSP have assumed that the cities/targets to be visited are stationary. <p> From among the many existing approximation algorithms for classical (stationary) TSP <ref> [4] </ref>, choose one such heuristic, having performance bound ff. Using this algorithm for stationary targets, we can construct an efficient algorithm (see Figure 2) with performance bound of 1 + ff when the number of moving targets is sufficiently small.

Reference-contexts: However, if we first intercept all of the targets on one side of the origin, then we will later need to spend much more time chasing the fast target on the other side. 4 Historical note: after we submitted this paper to ESA'98, we received an unpublished technical report <ref> [8] </ref> that claims to solve the one-dimensional variant in time O (n 3 ); our algorithm for the same problem runs in time O (n 2 ), based on a different approach.
