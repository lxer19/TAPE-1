Abstract: A Hierarchical Extended Kohonen Map (HEKM) learns to associate actions to perceptions under the supervision of a planner: they cooperate to solve path finding problems. We argue for the utility of using the hierarchical version of the KM instead of the "flat" KM. We measure the benefits of cooperative learning due to the interaction of neighboring neurons in the HEKM. We highlight a beneficial side-effect obtained by transferring motion skill from the planner to the HEKM, namely, smoothness of motion.

Reference-contexts: On the contrary, with cooperation (curve with white dots) it takes more time to reach the very same error level, but the final error is lower. This type of behavior seems to be typical for cooperating agents, as it reported in <ref> [1] </ref>. In our experiment, a possible explanation for this could be that, when the cooperation between the neurons is active, it takes more time to find a good "compromise" to Fig. 3. Error (left) and performance (right) without cooperation (black dots) and with cooperation (white dots). Fig. 4.

We found that with cooperation learning is slowed down on the short run. But the benefits appear later on, resulting in a more satisfactory final performance.

Reference-contexts: Both methods have limitations, which are rather complementary. By integrating the two methods, we can mitigate their respective drawbacks.

Reference-contexts: Both the xy-translations and the rotation take discrete values, and can be either positive, negative or null. The SOM is a Hierarchical Extended Kohonen Map (HEKM) <ref> [8] </ref>. The map is "hierarchical" because it processes the input perception in sequence (see below for explanation); it is "extended" because it is trained on the output action in a supervised fashion. Essentialy, the network operation is divided into two steps.

Reference-contexts: While model-based systems address the path finding problem globally using a model of the workspace, sensor-based systems consider it locally, and rely on robot sensors to avoid obstacles. Both methods have limitations, which are rather complementary. By integrating the two methods, we can mitigate their respective drawbacks. Thus, in <ref> [9] </ref> we have described a model-based system (a planner [3] working on an artificial potential field) and a sensor-based system (a Hierarchical Extended Kohonen Map) which cooperate to solve the path finding problem.
