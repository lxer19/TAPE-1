Reference-contexts: Sequences with negative scores are not shown. The peaks at 105 and 115 bits are due to Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase sequences. of 15% to 22%. The six motifs map onto structurally important domains, some of which have been shown to be functionally important by site-specific mutagenesis studies <ref> [100, 1, 34, 111, 131, 35] </ref> and structural analysis [126, 125]. Beginning at the amino terminus, the order of the motifs is (2)-(1)-(6)-(4)-(3)-(5). Their combined length is 85 amino acids, and they span 183 residues of 20fi-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

Reference-contexts: The FPS algorithm involves computing, for each sequence in the database being searched, its average pairwise similarity score with the sequences in the family of known ho-mologs comprising the query. These similarity scores may be computed using a sequence search algorithm such as BLAST <ref> [2] </ref>. For small query sets, the FPS algorithm outperforms a full-sequence hidden Markov Model approach (HMMER [46]) and a motif-based modeling approach (model construction by MEME [6] followed by search 55 56 with MAST [11]) to homology detection. The explanations for the relatively poor performances of these model-based techniques differ. <p> The current work investigates using the BLAST and Smith-Waterman algorithms for computing query-to-sequence similarities. For BLAST searches, we use the "bit score" [3] as the similarity score. For Smith-Waterman searches, we use the negative logarithm of the p-value of the Smith-Waterman score. 1 We use gapped BLAST version 2.0 <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, a heuristic approximation of a dynamic programming optimization of maximal segment pair scores. In order to use cobbled profiles as BLAST queries, we obtained a pre-release version of PSI-BLAST [3] that is capable of storing and reading binary checkpoint files. <p> MAST searches are carried out using the first six motifs discovered by MEME. Each motif model is used to score each database sequence, and these scores are subsequently combined into an overall E-value for that sequence. The Family Pairwise Search algorithm uses gapped BLAST <ref> [2] </ref> to compute a bit score for each sequence in the database with respect to each training set sequence. The final score of the database sequence is the average of 138 the individual training set scores. Each homology detection experiment returns a score-labeled version of the database.

Since these files contain a frequency matrix representation of the query, converting our cobbled frequency profiles to the BLAST checkpoint format is straightforward. PSI-BLAST is run for one iteration with its default parameters. <p> Iterating this bootstrap procedure should provide even better homology information than the single pass reported here. Iterative applications of BLAST have been suggested by Koonin and Tatusov [82] and implemented in Probe [98] and PSI-BLAST <ref> [3] </ref>. PSI-BLAST employs a non-motif-based, position-specific scoring matrix representation; Probe, on the other hand, employs motif models. The current results indicate that a hybrid Cobbler representation may be superior to either a sequence-level or motif-only model.

Reference-contexts: The six strongest motifs in the set of thirty-seven divergent dehydrogenase sequences are determined using MEME version 2.0. MEME is run with the ZOOPS model, with the minimum motif width set at 12 amino acids, and the Dirichlet mixture prior <ref> [8, 60] </ref>. Next, Genpept release 96 is searched with all six motifs using MAST. The motif occurrence diagram from the highest-scoring protein provides the framework for a linear Meta-MEME model incorporating all six motifs.

Ungapped motifs are discovered and modeled using MEME version 2.2 [6] with the default parameter settings from the web interface [60].

The motif-based HMM is constructed from all six motifs, and motif occurrence information from a MAST analysis of the training set is used to initialize the transition matrix in the HMM, as described in Section II.C.

Reference-contexts: Because all protein families in the database we search have far fewer than 1000 members, this approach should yield the same results as actually computing all similarity scores. III.B Comparing homology detection methods We use a collection of 73 protein families <ref> [10, 59] </ref> in our homology detection experiments (see Appendix A). These families were selected from the PROSITE database [12] for their difficulty, based upon the number of false positives reported in the PROSITE annotations. <p> Furthermore, although both Meta-MEME and MAST perform significantly better than standard HMMs, none of these three methods performs as well as Family Pairwise Search. IV.E.2 Methods For all these experiments, the collection of 73 protein families <ref> [10] </ref> described in Section III.B is used. These families were selected from the PROSITE database [12] release 13.0 for their difficulty, based upon the number of false positives reported in the PROSITE annotations. The PROSITE IDs and sizes of these families are listed in Appendix A. <p> The final column (R) indicates whether the family contains repeated elements. Two families from the original set of 75 <ref> [10] </ref> were discarded because they contain a single sequence after binary sequence weighting. 166

Reference-contexts: These similarity scores may be computed using a sequence search algorithm such as BLAST [2]. For small query sets, the FPS algorithm outperforms a full-sequence hidden Markov Model approach (HMMER [46]) and a motif-based modeling approach (model construction by MEME [6] followed by search 55 56 with MAST <ref> [11] </ref>) to homology detection. The explanations for the relatively poor performances of these model-based techniques differ. For HMMER, the difficulty lies in the large number of model parameters relative to the size of the training set. <p> The database is searched using just this profile, and the averaging step is skipped. Finally, we compare the FPS approach with two strictly model-based approaches. The MEME motifs discovered previously are provided as a single query to the MAST <ref> [11] </ref> homology search algorithm. For each sequence in the database, MAST compute a p-value for each motif in the query and combines these values assuming that motif occurrences are statistically independent. The resulting sequence-level p-value scores are used to rank the sequences in the database. <p> Including the untrained models, this procedure results in a set of sixteen models (two topologies, two spacer representations, and four types of training) for each training set of sequences. These parameters are summarized in Table IV.19. Meta-MEME's performance is compared with three other homology detection methods: HMMER [46], MAST <ref> [11] </ref> and the Family Pairwise Search (FPS) algorithm described in Chapter III. For each training set, HMMER version 1.8 is used to train a standard hidden Markov model via expectation-maximization coupled with simulated annealing.

Reference-contexts: The example shown in Figure II.7 contains eight states. A distribution generated by a similar eight-state model 34 Figure II.6: Observed spacer length distributions of a typical protein family. A family of short chain alcohol dehydrogenases from PROSITE <ref> [12] </ref> was used. Highly similar sequences were removed, and six motifs were discovered in the resulting set of divergent sequences.

The resulting value is = 114:6. Thus, the values of the pseudocounts are computed using equation II.31 with = 114:6 and equal to the empirical mean of the training set. Choosing the number n of pseudocounts corresponds to choosing the weight of the prior. <p> III.B Comparing homology detection methods We use a collection of 73 protein families [10, 59] in our homology detection experiments (see Appendix A). These families were selected from the PROSITE database <ref> [12] </ref> for their difficulty, based upon the number of false positives reported in the PROSITE annotations. The families range in size from 5 to 109 sequences, and from 949 to 58 015 amino acids. The associated release of SWISS-PROT [13] contains 36 000 sequences and nearly 12.5 million amino acids. <p> We also search for homologs of a set of 159 4Fe-4S ferredoxins [101]. These sequences comprise all known 4Fe-4S ferredoxins in SWISS-PROT release 33 [13]. Family members were selected using PROSITE 13.1 <ref> [12] </ref>. Ten additional members were added to the family by Michael Gribskov, based upon ROC analysis and sequence comparisons. The SWISS-PROT identifiers for all 159 sequences, as well as the justifications for including the ten additional sequences, are given in Table IV.9. <p> The sequences of several homologs, such as halohydrin epoxidase [135] and the sugar epimerases [77, 85, 19], have diverged from the signature motif used in PROSITE <ref> [12] </ref>, which has made identification of their ancestry difficult. 108 Score Seq Mod ID Species Description 23.2 138-195 46-85 46868 S. coelicolor ORF3 protein 21.3 32-203 2-58 861340 C. elegans similar to ribitol dehydrogenase 19.7 15-101 1-22 603171 E. coli unknown 19.1 12-45 58-85 453866 A. thaliana tropinone reductase homologue 18.8 <p> IV.E.2 Methods For all these experiments, the collection of 73 protein families [10] described in Section III.B is used.

The associated release of SWISS-PROT <ref> [13] </ref> contains 36 000 sequences and nearly 12.5 million amino acids. Bias within the families is minimized via sequence weighting. Since many weighting schemes perform almost as well as one another [70], all the experiments reported here employ a simple, binary weighting scheme based upon BLAST similarity scores [87]. <p> These thirty-eight sequences represent a small portion of the approximately 650 known dehydrogenases in GenBank release 95 [55]. We also search for homologs of a set of 159 4Fe-4S ferredoxins [101]. These sequences comprise all known 4Fe-4S ferredoxins in SWISS-PROT release 33 <ref> [13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Especially for sequences that are widely divergent, a perfect multiple alignment may be impossible to create. Consequently, an alignment of the entire sequence will often contain errors that can lead to corresponding errors in the phylogenetic inference. Several authors <ref> [20, 86] </ref> have produced phylogenetic trees based upon con 42 strained alignments from which the noisy regions have been discarded. Similarly, CLUSTALW [123] contains an option for eliminating from consideration all positions in the multiple alignment that contain insertions or deletions. <p> Others have dealt with this problem and have constructed useful phylogenetic trees by ignoring the highly divergent segments containing insertions and deletions <ref> [20, 86] </ref>. We find that concatenated MEME motifs also yield useful trees, with the advantage that the analysis is unbiased and automated. IV.C.2 Methods The training set of alcohol dehydrogenases consists of the thirty-eight sequences listed in Table IV.7, except for dTDP-Glucose 4,6-Dehydratase.

Reference-contexts: Typically, this algorithm maximizes the likelihood of the data, given the model. However, like MEME, Meta-MEME employs Dirichlet mixture priors <ref> [32] </ref> in the training of emission probabilities, thereby maximizing the posterior probability of the model, given the data. In MEME, information about the occurrences of multiple motifs within a single sequence is unavailable. <p> Second, a statistical model can incorporate prior knowledge that effectively augments the information provided in the query set. For this purpose, MEME employs a set of empirically derived Dirichlet mixture priors <ref> [32] </ref>. These priors allow MEME to guess from very little evidence a biologically plausible amino acid distribution for each position in the motif model. <p> Motifs lengths can range between 12 and 55 amino acids, and the probability distributions at each position are estimated using Dirichlet mixture priors <ref> [32] </ref> modi fied by the Mega-prior heuristic [9].

Reference-contexts: These similarity scores may be computed using a sequence search algorithm such as BLAST [2]. For small query sets, the FPS algorithm outperforms a full-sequence hidden Markov Model approach (HMMER <ref> [46] </ref>) and a motif-based modeling approach (model construction by MEME [6] followed by search 55 56 with MAST [11]) to homology detection. The explanations for the relatively poor performances of these model-based techniques differ. <p> The resulting sequence-level p-value scores are used to rank the sequences in the database. In addition, hidden Markov models of each query set are built using the HMMER software package version 1.8 <ref> [46] </ref>. Models are trained using expectation-maximization coupled with simulated annealing. The default geometric annealing schedule is used, and Dirichlet mixture priors allow the models to be trained with smaller training sets. Database searches are carried out using a modified form of the Smith-Waterman algorithm. <p> Many of the ferredoxins, on the other hand, contain repeated elements, making the linear topology less appropriate for this family. In order to compare Meta-MEME's motif-based strategy with the standard topology, we create Meta-MEME models in a format readable by the standard HMM package HMMER <ref> [46] </ref>. This allows us to perform database searches using the same searching software for both the HMMER and the Meta-MEME models. <p> Next, Genpept release 96 is searched with all six motifs using MAST. The motif occurrence diagram from the highest-scoring protein provides the framework for a linear Meta-MEME model incorporating all six motifs. This motif-based HMM is used by a modified Smith-Waterman algorithm <ref> [46] </ref> to search Genpept 96 for homologs. The output score for each sequence is expressed as log-odds scores in bits (i.e., log 2 ). <p> Including the untrained models, this procedure results in a set of sixteen models (two topologies, two spacer representations, and four types of training) for each training set of sequences. These parameters are summarized in Table IV.19. Meta-MEME's performance is compared with three other homology detection methods: HMMER <ref> [46] </ref>, MAST [11] and the Family Pairwise Search (FPS) algorithm described in Chapter III. For each training set, HMMER version 1.8 is used to train a standard hidden Markov model via expectation-maximization coupled with simulated annealing. <p> This topology allowed Meta-MEME to create models in a format readable by the HMMER software <ref> [46] </ref>, thereby providing Meta-MEME with access to the suite of sophisticated search tools available in HMMER. These tools include, most importantly, the program hmmsw, which implements a modified version of the Smith-Waterman algorithm tailored to hidden Markov models.

Reference-contexts: This stability requires further explanation. The small change in performance afforded by the more complex search algorithm implemented in the HMMER search tool hmmsw is somewhat surprising. Unfortunately, although the hmmsw algorithm is described <ref> [47] </ref> as a hidden Markov model implementation of Smith-Waterman local alignment, the details of the algorithm are unpublished. As a local search algorithm, hmmsw allows a subsequence of the database sequence to match a subsequence of the states in the linear HMM.

Reference-contexts: The remaining motif models are combined into a Meta-MEME linear hidden Markov model with single-state spacer models. The HMM is then used to align the mitochondrial sequences, throwing out non-motif regions. The resulting alignment is given as input to the protein parsimony program in Phylip <ref> [50] </ref>. The reported tree is the single most parsimonious tree found in ten random shu*es of the sequences. IV.A.3 Results Multiple alignments Figures IV.1 and IV.2 show multiple alignments generated by HMMER and by Meta-MEME for the globin family. <p> This phylogeny is based upon a 49-motif alignment. It is the single most parsimonious tree found by the protein parsimony program in Phylip <ref> [50] </ref>. 90 IV.A.4 Discussion The first set of experiments reported here show that Meta-MEME produces multiple alignments that are comparable in quality to the best alignments currently available, and that are better than alignments produced by a non-motif based hidden Markov modeling package. <p> In order to construct a phylogenetic tree, the sequences of the first six motifs from the MEME analysis of each dehydrogenase homolog were collapsed into a single string. These motif-only strings were analyzed using the protein parsimony analysis program from the Phylip software package <ref> [50] </ref>. The analysis was repeated 30 times, using at each iteration a random reordering of the sequences, and selecting the most parsimonious tree from all iterations. <p> We therefore combined the first six motifs for each protein into a single sequence, which by virtue of the MEME analysis can be aligned with the other thirty-six proteins. Two equally parsimonious phylogenies were discovered by Phylip <ref> [50] </ref>. One of these two is shown in Figure IV.11; the other phylogeny was similar. <p> The sequences of the first six motifs from the MEME analysis of each protein were collapsed into a single sequence and analyzed by parsimony analysis <ref> [50] </ref>. The 11fi-hydroxysteroid and 17fi-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases-type 1 cluster together on a branch separate from 17fi-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases-type 2 and 3, which are on separate branches. The motif phylogeny is in agreement with a phylogenetic analysis of the entire sequences of the steroid dehydrogenases [18]. 112 drogenase.

Reference-contexts: The motifs are mapped onto the primary sequence of 20fi-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in Figure IV.9. Also shown in Figure IV.9 is the secondary structure determined from X-ray crystallographic analysis <ref> [56] </ref>. The secondary and tertiary structure of this enzyme is very similar to homologs such as dihydropteridine reductase [127], 17fi-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-type 1 [31], enoyl reductases [114, 24], and E. coli 7ff-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [121] despite having pairwise sequence similarities 104 Figure IV.8: Motifs from MEME analysis of short chain alcohol dehydroge-nases. <p> Each motif as determined by MEME is shown below the sequence of S. hydrogenans 20fi-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. The secondary structure was determined from the X-ray analysis of crystals of S. hydroge-nans 20fi-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase <ref> [56] </ref>, and has a similar fold to that of its homologs [127, 31, 114, 24, 121]. The boxed segment at the beginning of motif 3 contains the conserved tyrosine and lysine residues at the catalytic site. 106 Figure IV.10: Meta-MEME analysis of Genpept 96.

Reference-contexts: Cobbling [72] is a hybrid modeling scheme that addresses both of these problems. A cobbled profile model of a protein family is constructed by converting a single, representative family member (the template sequence) into a profile <ref> [57] </ref> and then replacing the motif regions with profile representations of the motifs. All gap opening and extension penalties in the profile are set to the same values. The number of trainable parameters in the cobbled profile model is small, because models are only learned for the motif regions. <p> Five query format types are considered: the original sequences, the motif regions of the sequences, motif models built from the sequences, a standard HMM of the sequences, or the cobbled profiles of the sequences.

Reference-contexts: A modified version of the Receiver Operating Characteristic, called ROC 50 <ref> [58] </ref>, is used to compare the various search techniques. The ROC score is the area under a curve that plots true positives versus false positives for varying score thresholds. ROC analysis combines measures of a search's sensitivity and selectivity. <p> Models that have been trained include a Gaussian model of sequence length, so the homology scoring for these models includes the length component, as described in Section II.J. Homology detection results from different training sets are compared using the ROC 50 score <ref> [58] </ref>. This score, which was described in Section III.B, is the area under a curve that plots, for various classification thresholds, the true positives versus the false positives, up to the first fifty false positives. <p> Perfect performance corresponds to a series of 1s followed by a series of 0s. This bit sequence is subjected to two forms of analysis. The first is a modified version of the Receiver Operating Characteristic, called ROC 50 <ref> [58] </ref>. The ROC score is the area under a curve that plots true positives versus false positives for varying score thresholds. ROC analysis combines measures of a search's sensitivity and selectivity. The ROC 50 score is the area under the ROC curve, up to the first 50 false positives.

Reference-contexts: Because all protein families in the database we search have far fewer than 1000 members, this approach should yield the same results as actually computing all similarity scores. III.B Comparing homology detection methods We use a collection of 73 protein families <ref> [10, 59] </ref> in our homology detection experiments (see Appendix A). These families were selected from the PROSITE database [12] for their difficulty, based upon the number of false positives reported in the PROSITE annotations. <p> We therefore intend to investigate the use of the cobbled profile BLAST FPS algorithm within an iterative framework.

Reference-contexts: All gap opening and extension penalties in the log-odds profiles were set to 100. Motifs need only be discovered once for each query set. Ungapped motifs are discovered and modeled using MEME version 2.2 [6] with the default parameter settings from the web interface <ref> [60] </ref>. These defaults include empirical Dirichlet mixture priors weighted according to the megaprior heuristic [9], a minimum motif width of 12 and a maximum of 55, and a motif model biased toward zero or one motif occurrence per sequence. <p> The six strongest motifs in the set of thirty-seven divergent dehydrogenase sequences are determined using MEME version 2.0. MEME is run with the ZOOPS model, with the minimum motif width set at 12 amino acids, and the Dirichlet mixture prior <ref> [8, 60] </ref>. Next, Genpept release 96 is searched with all six motifs using MAST. The motif occurrence diagram from the highest-scoring protein provides the framework for a linear Meta-MEME model incorporating all six motifs.

Reference-contexts: The Meta-MEME software toolkit is a work in progress. The experiments reported in Chapter IV point toward several improvements. Chief among these is the inclusion of a Viterbi-based training algorithm [21, 94]. Currently, a prototype Meta-MEME web server is being developed at the San Diego Supercomputer Center <ref> [63] </ref>. This server will make available Meta-MEME's modeling, alignment and homology detection capabilities to the larger biological community. Meta-MEME will succeed only if its analytical power is available, interpretable and usable by molecular biologists.

Reference-contexts: Rather than connecting motifs in a particular order, this model contains a complete set of transitions among motifs. This topology allows for the accurate modeling of families such as the ice-nucleation proteins, which contain up to 57 consecutive copies of a single subsequence <ref> [133, 64] </ref>. The completely connected topology also allows for the modeling of families, such as the kinases, in which a set of domains appears in different orders in different family members. <p> Some of these copying events result in proteins with small tandem repeats, 113 such as are found in the ice-nucleating proteins <ref> [133, 64] </ref>; other proteins contain repeated elements, such as zinc fingers or kringle domains, located in varying positions throughout the protein. Meta-MEME is the only computational tool currently available that explicitly models these repeated elements.

Reference-contexts: The number of trainable parameters in the cobbled profile model is small, because models are only learned for the motif regions. The rest of the profile is constructed by simply replacing the letter in the template sequence with a column from a pairwise score matrix such as BLOSUM <ref> [69] </ref>. Thus, the cobbled model retains useful homology information in the inter-motif regions by embedding the motif models into the profile constructed from the inter-motif regions of the template sequence. In this chapter we extend the FPS algorithm to searching with profiles.

Reference-contexts: The result is a set of relatively well-trained motif models. However, MEME loses homology information by discarding the non-motif regions of the sequences [107], and this loss affects MAST's search performance. Cobbling <ref> [72] </ref> is a hybrid modeling scheme that addresses both of these problems. A cobbled profile model of a protein family is constructed by converting a single, representative family member (the template sequence) into a profile [57] and then replacing the motif regions with profile representations of the motifs. <p> These last four search methods do not involve the averaging step of the FPS algorithm. To convert a sequence in the query set to a cobbled profile, we use a modified version of the Cobbler <ref> [72] </ref> algorithm to embed motif profiles into a profile constructed from the template sequence. Our modified version of the algorithm can output both log-odds profiles and frequency profiles. <p> The second set of experiments reported here, however, show that statistical models, used appropriately, can be helpful even for very small query sets. The Cobbler approach <ref> [72] </ref> is an effective means of reducing the size of the models being trained while retaining homology information in noisy regions of the query sequence. The FPS algorithm takes Cobbler one step further by retaining the noisy regions of all query sequences, rather than a single representative.

Reference-contexts: Since motifs (and blocks) are supposed to model ungapped regions, MEME generally produces more accurate models. The BLOCKS database [28] contains, for each known protein family, an ordered set of blocks along with the minimum and maximum observed spacings between the blocks in the training set. The BLIMPS program <ref> [73] </ref> searches this database using a single sequence as a query, thus taking into account the order and spacing of blocks. Clearly, Meta-MEME's linear models and the BLOCKS method share many features. In general, however, a hidden Markov model approach is more attractive because of its well-founded underlying probabilistic theory.

PSI-BLAST employs a non-motif-based, position-specific scoring matrix representation; Probe, on the other hand, employs motif models.

Reference-contexts: Especially for sequences that are widely divergent, a perfect multiple alignment may be impossible to create. Consequently, an alignment of the entire sequence will often contain errors that can lead to corresponding errors in the phylogenetic inference. Several authors <ref> [20, 86] </ref> have produced phylogenetic trees based upon con 42 strained alignments from which the noisy regions have been discarded. Similarly, CLUSTALW [123] contains an option for eliminating from consideration all positions in the multiple alignment that contain insertions or deletions. <p> Others have dealt with this problem and have constructed useful phylogenetic trees by ignoring the highly divergent segments containing insertions and deletions <ref> [20, 86] </ref>. We find that concatenated MEME motifs also yield useful trees, with the advantage that the analysis is unbiased and automated.

Reference-contexts: II.K Discussion In many ways, Meta-MEME resembles the BLOCKS method for protein family classification [71, 67]. The BLOCKMAKER program discovers highly conserved regions of protein families by combining motifs found by either the MOTIF algorithm [117] or the Gibbs sampling algorithm <ref> [87] </ref>. Individual blocks may be represented as ungapped position-specific scoring matrices, similar to the motif models 52 (b) Figure II.14: Combining normally distributed length scores with total prob ability and Viterbi scores. 53 Figure II.15: Elimination of long false positive matches via explicit length modeling. created by MEME. <p> Bias within the families is minimized via sequence weighting. Since many weighting schemes perform almost as well as one another [70], all the experiments reported here employ a simple, binary weighting scheme based upon BLAST similarity scores <ref> [87] </ref>. This approach is simple, since the highly similar sequences can be removed at once before any analysis is performed, and leads to faster training, since the sizes of the weighted training sets are reduced. For these experiments, a BLAST similarity threshold of 200 is used. <p> See Table IV.13 for the list of SWISS-PROT identifiers in this family. As in previous experiments (see Section. III.B) binary sequence weighting is employed to reduce redundancy within the protein families. After eliminating eight sequence fragments from the set of 4Fe-4S ferredoxins, the purge program <ref> [87] </ref> is used to eliminate highly similar sequences, using a similarity threshold of 200 bits. This procedure results in a set of 70 divergent sequences. <p> The PROSITE IDs and sizes of these families are listed in Appendix A. The associated release of SWISS-PROT [13] (version 28) contains 36 000 sequences and nearly 12.5 million amino acids. As in previous experiments (see Section III.B) binary sequence weighting is carried out with the purge program <ref> [87] </ref>. The sizes of the purged families are given in Appendix A. For each family, one series of nested subsets is randomly selected, containing 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 sequences, limited by the total number of divergent sequences in the family.

Reference-contexts: Given that little can be said about the general form of the distributions of spacer lengths, the usual choice would be to model these distributions using a bell-shaped curve such as a Gaussian. Explicitly representing this length distribution within the HMM is straightforward <ref> [88] </ref>. However, including in the model single states that generate multiple amino acids violates the Markov property of the model and therefore results in a large increase in computational complexity.

Reference-contexts: Both methods could almost certainly perform better if their parameters were optimized for these data sets. Finally, the DFALIGN method of Feng and Doolittle likely performs best because its algorithm was modified in order to cope with problems presented by these particular data sets <ref> [90] </ref>. Given these considerations, Meta-MEME's performance is quite impressive. That performance could likely be improved even further if the Meta-MEME models were trained via expectation-maximization. The phylogenetic tree presented in the second experiment suggests that motif-based alignments are useful in inferring phylogenetic relationships.

Reference-contexts: There are three important points to be made about these motif-only alignments. First, the task of aligning the biologically significant motif regions is the most important part of the multiple alignment task, from a biological perspective <ref> [92] </ref>. An alignment that fails to properly align these regions is not very useful. Second, from a computational perspective, the task of aligning the spacer regions, insofar as they can be aligned, is much easier than the global task of aligning entire sequences. <p> In the first set of experiments reported here, we compare motif alignments created by Meta-MEME with multiple alignments generated by ten other multiple alignment methods. The quality of an alignment is judged, following McClure et al. <ref> [92, 91] </ref>, according to its success in properly aligning a set of known, biologically significant regions.

Reference-contexts: There is reason to believe, however, that motif-only multiple alignments may be useful even in situations in which the alignment is undisputed. Recent evidence <ref> [96] </ref> suggests that the best phylogenetic trees are generated by amino acids that are important in determining the three-dimensional structure of the protein. This evidence is discussed in more detail in Section IV.A. <p> In the second set of experiments reported here, we use Meta-MEME to analyze a set of mitochondrial proteins from fourteen chordate and five non-chordate species. This data set was used by Naylor and Brown <ref> [96] </ref> in a comparison of phy-logenetic inference algorithms. Because these are species for which there exists an abundant fossil record, their phylogenetic relationships are undisputed. Hence, there is a known, true tree for this data set.

Reference-contexts: These biases may explain the relatively large standard error bars in Figure IV.6 (b).

Reference-contexts: Iterating this bootstrap procedure should provide even better homology information than the single pass reported here. Iterative applications of BLAST have been suggested by Koonin and Tatusov [82] and implemented in Probe <ref> [98] </ref> and PSI-BLAST [3]. PSI-BLAST employs a non-motif-based, position-specific scoring matrix representation; Probe, on the other hand, employs motif models. The current results indicate that a hybrid Cobbler representation may be superior to either a sequence-level or motif-only model. <p> The total size of the data set is 71 001 amino acids. Fifty motifs are discovered four divergent sequences (snail, nematode, opos 81 sum and lancelet) using MEME 2.0. These sequences were selected using the purge program with a BLAST threshold of 1500 bits <ref> [98] </ref>. Of the fifty motif models, one is discarded because it appears in less than half of the nineteen sequences in the original data set. The remaining motif models are combined into a Meta-MEME linear hidden Markov model with single-state spacer models.

These thirty-eight sequences represent a small portion of the approximately 650 known dehydrogenases in GenBank release 95 [55]. We also search for homologs of a set of 159 4Fe-4S ferredoxins <ref> [101] </ref>. These sequences comprise all known 4Fe-4S ferredoxins in SWISS-PROT release 33 [13].

The ferredoxins mediate electron transfer in a wide variety of metabolic reactions. The 4Fe-4S group is characterized by a 26-amino-acid domain containing four cysteine residues that bind to four iron and four sulfur atoms. PROSITE version 13.1 lists 149 4Fe-4S ferredoxins.

Reference-contexts: The database contains 36 000 sequences, of which 116 belong to this family, leading to a threshold of log 2 (36 000=116) = 8:28 bits. This threshold is shown in the figure, and leads to a classification with 12 false negatives and 16 false positives. The equivalence score <ref> [105] </ref>, which is the classification threshold yielding an equal number of false positives and false negatives, falls at 9.49 bits and gives 13 false positives. The scaling of Viterbi scores via the log-odds calculation is much less successful than was the scaling of total probability scores. <p> ROC 50 scores are normalized to range from 0 to 1, with 1 corresponding to the most sensitive and selective search. In addition to ROC 50 analysis, each homology detection method is evaluated using the normalized equivalence number <ref> [105] </ref>. The equivalence number is the number of false positives given by a database search when the classification threshold is set so that the number of false positives equals the number of false negatives.

Reference-contexts: MEME, on the other hand, reduces the number of trainable parameters by focusing only upon the motif regions of the training set. The result is a set of relatively well-trained motif models. However, MEME loses homology information by discarding the non-motif regions of the sequences <ref> [107] </ref>, and this loss affects MAST's search performance. Cobbling [72] is a hybrid modeling scheme that addresses both of these problems. <p> The method thereby allows for the detection of remote homologs that lack significant similarity with one or more of the training set sequences.

II.F Model training Once a set of MEME motif models has been assembled into a single hidden Markov model, the model's emission and transition parameters can be trained via the Baum-Welch algorithm <ref> [112] </ref>, a version of the expectation-maximization algorithm. Typically, this algorithm maximizes the likelihood of the data, given the model. However, like MEME, Meta-MEME employs Dirichlet mixture priors [32] in the training of emission probabilities, thereby maximizing the posterior probability of the model, given the data.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, within the HMM the motifs may be completely connected, so that entire motifs may be repeated, skipped, or shu*ed. Motif-based HMMs therefore allow for evolutionary mechanisms such as large-scale deletions and copying events. Thus, this generalized topology implies a domain-based model of molecular evolution <ref> [119] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, an alignment of the entire sequence will often contain errors that can lead to corresponding errors in the phylogenetic inference. Several authors [20, 86] have produced phylogenetic trees based upon con 42 strained alignments from which the noisy regions have been discarded. Similarly, CLUSTALW <ref> [123] </ref> contains an option for eliminating from consideration all positions in the multiple alignment that contain insertions or deletions. Meta-MEME provides a theoretically justified means of deciding which regions of the sequences are highly conserved and hence can be trusted for producing a phylogenetic tree.

Reference-contexts: The genome sequencing projects currently underway represent the first major convergence of these two fields and have led to the birth of the new subdiscipline, bioinformatics. Thirteen completed genomes are publicly available on the web <ref> [124] </ref> as of May, 1998. In the post-genomic era, when complete genomes are known for many species and even for many individual organisms within a species, the volume of sequence data available will require increasingly sophisticated computational analyses.

Reference-contexts: The motifs are mapped onto the primary sequence of 20fi-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in Figure IV.9. Also shown in Figure IV.9 is the secondary structure determined from X-ray crystallographic analysis [56]. The secondary and tertiary structure of this enzyme is very similar to homologs such as dihydropteridine reductase <ref> [127] </ref>, 17fi-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-type 1 [31], enoyl reductases [114, 24], and E. coli 7ff-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [121] despite having pairwise sequence similarities 104 Figure IV.8: Motifs from MEME analysis of short chain alcohol dehydroge-nases.

The secondary structure was determined from the X-ray analysis of crystals of S. hydroge-nans 20fi-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [56], and has a similar fold to that of its homologs <ref> [127, 31, 114, 24, 121] </ref>. The boxed segment at the beginning of motif 3 contains the conserved tyrosine and lysine residues at the catalytic site. 106 Figure IV.10: Meta-MEME analysis of Genpept 96.

Reference-contexts: See caption on p. 107 110 due to an insertion of 41 residues between motifs 4 and 2 <ref> [128] </ref>. This insertion does not compromise the analysis. Meta-MEME output is useful in identifying the region where a distantly homologous protein has diverged from the dataset. For example, Drosophila immigrans alcohol dehydrogenase has a score of 90.6 bits based on residues 14-85 of the template.

Reference-contexts: In order to avoid the computational overhead of modeling length distributions explicitly, Meta-MEME employs multi-state spacer models, as shown in Figure II.7. These multi-state spacers exploit the Central Limit Theorem <ref> [132] </ref>, which states that, in the limit, the sum of multiple, independent distributions with finite means and variances approaches a normal distribution. The example shown in Figure II.7 contains eight states.

Reference-contexts: Rather than connecting motifs in a particular order, this model contains a complete set of transitions among motifs. This topology allows for the accurate modeling of families such as the ice-nucleation proteins, which contain up to 57 consecutive copies of a single subsequence <ref> [133, 64] </ref>. The completely connected topology also allows for the modeling of families, such as the kinases, in which a set of domains appears in different orders in different family members. <p> Some of these copying events result in proteins with small tandem repeats, 113 such as are found in the ice-nucleating proteins <ref> [133, 64] </ref>; other proteins contain repeated elements, such as zinc fingers or kringle domains, located in varying positions throughout the protein. Meta-MEME is the only computational tool currently available that explicitly models these repeated elements.
