Title: Combining Reasoning Modes, Levels, and Styles through Internal CBR  
Author: David B. Leake and Andrew Kinley

Affiliation: Computer Science Department Indiana University,  
Abstract: This paper discusses motivations and proposes methods for integrating multiple reasoning modes, styles, and levels within a case-based reasoning system. It describes a CBR system in which rule-based internal processing is augmented with two styles of case-based reasoning, derivational and transformational CBR, and which reasons at both the domain-level and the meta-level, in order to respond to the requirements of different processing tasks. The fundamental principal is for the system to learn by monitoring, capturing, and exploiting multiple types of prior system reasoning. The paper considers the ramifications of this approach and its potential as a strategy for multimodal reasoning in other contexts.

Reference-contexts: Less common are CBR systems that integrate CBR and rule-based reasoning for a single task, though this has been investigated by a number of researchers, for example, for design <ref> (Goel 1989) </ref> and for guiding the application of ill-defined terms in the legal domain (Branting & Porter 1991; Rissland & Skalak 1991).

Reference-contexts: Relationship to Prior Research Case-based reasoning systems commonly use rule-based systems for internal tasks such as guiding the application of cases <ref> (Kolodner 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The resulting cases increase reasoning efficiency, in the spirit of domain-level CBR systems that use cases to capture the domain-level results of a generative problem-solver <ref> (Koton 1988) </ref> or its reasoning process (Veloso 1994). In addition to focusing on internal reasoning issues, our approach emphasizes the ongoing integration of case-based and rule-base processing.

Reference-contexts: Based on experience with this system we make a more general claim: that using CBR components to monitor, capture, and replay a system's reasoning processes is a promising approach to guiding those processes and augmenting their capabilities. Task and System Architecture Our testbed system, DIAL <ref> (Leake, Kinley, & Wilson 1996) </ref>, is a case-based planning system. DIAL's domain is disaster response planning, the initial high-level planning involved in deciding, for example, the basic outline for a plan to rescue and relocate the victims of a flood or earthquake. <p> The user informs it that the plan cannot be used because no volunteers are available. 1 This problem triggers DIAL's multimodal case adaptation component. That component first attempts to use derivational CBR for case adaptation: to re 1 The user inputs this information in a fixed problem-description vocabulary; see <ref> (Leake, Kinley, & Wilson 1996) </ref>. trieve a trace of reasoning from a similar prior adaptation, in order to replay it. Adaptation cases are more operational, and may be more reliable, than the system's initial set of general rules for guiding the adaptation process.

Reference-contexts: This process not only judges similarity, but also provides the information needed for future adaptation. Retrieved adaptation cases for the best plan are passed on to the adaptation component, in the spirit of Smyth and Keane's (1996) adaptation-guided retrieval. Details are available in <ref> (Leake, Kinley, & Wilson 1997a) </ref>. Why Multimodal Reasoning Each of the different reasoning methods applied in DIAL is selected in response to a different set of constraints.

Reference-contexts: We are now gathering quantitative data on the benefits of this multimodal processing. An initial set of ablation studies of the contributions of different combinations of reasoning methods|no learning, domain-level CBR and RBR alone, adaptation CBR alone, and the combination|is described in <ref> (Leake, Kinley, & Wilson 1997b) </ref>. In these tests, the overall processing speed of the combined system is superior to that of the "standard" CBR system on which it is based, as is the range of problems the system can solve.

Reference-contexts: When this case is reused, it may also be extended by rule-based reasoning to fit new needs. Our model of how this is carried out emphasizes the use of domain-independent strategies, with the aim of facilitating transfer of the approach to other task domains <ref> (Leake, Kinley, & Wil-son 1997c) </ref>. Learned adaptation cases provide precisely the information needed for another rule-based/case-based inter based planning. nal reasoning process, for similarity assessment.

Reference-contexts: For example, DIAL uses derivational analogy for its case adaptation process. In order to use this type of CBR, it is necessary to have access to a derivational trace of the underlying process that can be captured and reused. Because DIAL uses a "planful" memory search process <ref> (Leake 1995) </ref>, it is practical to capture a trace of that process for reuse. This would not be possible in systems with a more opaque reasoning process.

Reference-contexts: The basic strategy is to augment AI systems by embedding within them case-based "intelligent components" <ref> (Riesbeck 1996) </ref> that learn during normal processing. When similar problems arise in the future, the intelligent component furnishes a solution based on the stored case, to replace the initial reasoning process with CBR.

Reference-contexts: Methods and Motivations Disaster response plans must often be generated without complete information. In practice, human disaster response planners appear often to address this problem by transformational case-based reasoning for generating disaster response plans|their planning process is guided by remembering and adapting prior disaster response plans <ref> (Rosenthal, Charles, & Hart 1989) </ref>. This is the process modeled by DIAL's top-level planning process. An issue that arises in this approach is how to apply prior plans to new situations.

Reference-contexts: CBR has also been used in multimodal systems for tasks such as making decisions when rules conflict (An, Cercone, & Chan 1997), as a strategically selected method within multimodal reasoning systems (Goel et al. 1994), and to address problems that cannot be solved by rule-based techniques <ref> (Surma & Vanhoof 1995) </ref>. Rather than focusing on multimodal reasoning at the domain level, the focus of our research is on multimodal internal reasoning; we primarily examine how internal derivational CBR guides the system's reasoning processes and augments their capabilities.

Reference-contexts: The resulting cases increase reasoning efficiency, in the spirit of domain-level CBR systems that use cases to capture the domain-level results of a generative problem-solver (Koton 1988) or its reasoning process <ref> (Veloso 1994) </ref>. In addition to focusing on internal reasoning issues, our approach emphasizes the ongoing integration of case-based and rule-base processing. Rather than simply falling back on rule-based reasoning when no case is available, its case-based and rule-based reasoning provide each other with information during ongoing processing.
