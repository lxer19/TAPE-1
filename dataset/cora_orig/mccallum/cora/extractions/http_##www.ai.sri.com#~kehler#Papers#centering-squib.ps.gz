Title: Current Theories of Centering for Pronoun Interpretation: A Critical Evaluation  
Author: Andrew Kehler 
Affiliation: SRI International  
Abstract: We review the fundamental concepts of centering theory, and discuss some facets of the pronoun interpretation problem that motivate a centering-style analysis. We then demonstrate some problems with a popular centering-based approach with respect to these motivations.

Reference-contexts: An entirely knowledge-based algorithm would not reproduce an addressee's immediate tendency to interpret a pronoun as cospec-ifying the backward center, even when this results in an implausible interpretation. <ref> (Brennan, 1995, pg. 145) </ref> However, other examples demonstrate that the BFP algorithm also cannot model an addressee's immediate tendency to interpret a pronoun, and therefore cannot properly account for the pronoun interpretation preferences that result from such tendencies.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction A central claim of centering theory <ref> (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995, henceforth GJW) </ref> is that certain entities mentioned in an utterance are more central than others, and that this property imposes constraints on a speaker's use of different types of expressions to refer to them. <p> Therefore some of the works described here as extending the work contained therein are dated prior to the published version. c fl 1997 Association for Computational Linguistics Computational Linguistics Volume 23, Number 3 backtracking to a correct interpretation. <ref> (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein, 1995, pg. 207) </ref> GJW exemplify the first of these motivations with passages (1) and (2). Passage (1) is presumed to be in a longer segment that is currently centered on John. (1) a. He has been acting quite odd. (He=John) b.

Reference-contexts: The fact that the BFP algorithm predicts the garden path effect exhibited by sentence (3e) is particularly indicative that it embodies the motivations for centering theory. As we noted in Section 2, such effects distinguish centering-based approaches from purely content-based models of reference and coherence <ref> (Hobbs, 1979, inter alia) </ref>.
