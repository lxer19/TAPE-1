Abstract: Head direction (HD) cells, abundant in the rat postsubiculum and anterior thalamic nuclei, fire maximally when the rat's head is facing a particular direction. The activity of a population of these cells forms a distributed representation of the animal's current heading. We describe a neural network model that creates a stable, distributed representation of head direction and updates that representation in response to angular velocity information. In contrast to earlier models, our model of the head direction system accurately tracks a series of actual rat head rotations, and, using biologically plausible neurons, it fits the single-cell tuning curves of real HD cells recorded from rats executing those same rotations. The model makes neurophysiological predictions that can be tested using current technologies.

Reference-contexts: Synaptic delays and the relatively low firing rates of HD cells bound the number of successive shift operations that can take place in a given time interval. One solution might be to use a parallel shifter circuit that can shift by any amount in one step, as in <ref> [1] </ref> or [25]. However, this requires a large number of connections which becomes prohibitive for a fine-scale representation of direction; it also seems an awkward approach to dealing with continuously variable angular velocity inputs.

Reference-contexts: The model includes intrinsic connections within ATN. There are few or no intrinsic connections within the anterior thalamic nuclei, and no evidence for inhibitory interneurons within the anterior dorsal (AD) nucleusy (see <ref> [2] </ref> for a review). We have found that if ATN is not organized as an attractor but merely sums the inputs from matching and offset connections, ATN tuning curves deform drastically during rotations. Since this has not been observed in the rat, we suggest that ATN does have attractor dynamics. <p> Another possible source of the offset connections is retrosplenial cortex, which includes head direction cells modulated by self-motion [5, 6] and is interconnected with the anterior thalamic nuclei <ref> [2, 26] </ref>. Cells in the mammillary bodies are assumed to fire at a rate proportional to angular velocity. Blair [3] makes a similar proposal, except that he assumes firing rate decreases with angular velocity. <p> In the cat, the effect of stimulating the mammillothalamic tract is inhibitory, but the actual synapses seen in rat would seem to be excitatory; see <ref> [2] </ref> for a review. We identify this gain control population with the mammillary bodies, but more work needs to be done to determine whether the mammillary bodies could actually play this role. As yet there are no published data on neural recordings from the mammillary bodies.

Blair <ref> [3] </ref> makes a similar proposal, except that he assumes firing rate decreases with angular velocity. Our model requires an inhibitory gain control input to the ATN:E population because without it, the combined input from the offset and matching connections distorts the ATN tuning curves.

We begin by comparing the model to data recorded by Blair and Sharp from freely moving rats (for details on recording methods, see <ref> [4] </ref>).

To counteract quantization error, we calculated the head direction at every time as the average direction over a 133 ms window centred at that time. <p> Given the parameters in table 1, the direction represented by the ATN:E population leads the direction represented by the PoS:E population by approximately 10 ms over a wide range of turning speeds. Although this is smaller than the 20-40 ms discrepancy reported in neurophysiological experiments <ref> [4, 24] </ref>, our model at least replicates the qualitative observation that ATN leads PoS. With further refinement, we hope to come closer to replicating the actual lead of ATN relative to the PoS population. 4.

Reference-contexts: Predictions 4.1. Existence of attractors The attractor nature of the postsubiculum and the anterior thalamic nuclei, an assumption common to several HD models, can be tested by injecting noise into the PoS and/or ATN populations. Because PoS cells are not arranged topographically (i.e. nearby neurons have unrelated preferred directions <ref> [18] </ref>), noise can be injected into the postsubiculum by microstimulation. The representation of head direction should be disrupted by this procedure, but if the postsubiculum is really an attractor system, the disruption should only be transient. <p> No such connections have been seen, however, the crucial aspect of the theory is that the loop from PoS to ATN and back must be modulated by vestibular input. Both Taube et al [22] and Sharp <ref> [18] </ref> report that some cells in postsubiculum are sensitive to both head direction and angular velocity.

Reference-contexts: Focusing on vestibular input, the head direction representation could be updated by integrating angular head velocity over time. Data showing that some cells in PoS code for angular head velocity and others code for head direction modulated by angular velocity <ref> [19] </ref> support such a possibility, as does the observation of cells in retrosplenial cortex that are correlated with head direction and modulated by self-motion information [5, 6].

Taube et al [23] report that PoS cells typically have baseline-to-baseline tuning curve widths of 100 ffi . <p> During rotations, this causes the tuning curves of ATN cells to be stretched to the rotating side. This should be easily testable using the asymmetry measurement of Taube et al <ref> [22] </ref>, defined as the absolute value of the ratio of the slopes of the left and right legs of the triangular tuning curve. <p> These simplifying assumptions were made for the purpose of keeping the simulation tractable. Real head direction cells show a wide range of tuning widths and heights <ref> [22, 23, 21] </ref>. All three assumptions could be relaxed by assuming that there is a distribution around each of these parameters (tuning width, tuning height, preferred direction) and that the values used are average values. <p> No such connections have been seen, however, the crucial aspect of the theory is that the loop from PoS to ATN and back must be modulated by vestibular input. Both Taube et al <ref> [22] </ref> and Sharp [18] report that some cells in postsubiculum are sensitive to both head direction and angular velocity.

Similar cells have been found in the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN) [4, 11, 21], most of which seem to be in the anterior dorsal (AD) nucleus. <p> such as a white card on the wall of a cylindrical arena x E-mail: dredish@cs.cmu.edu k Present address: Department of Linguistics and Philosophy, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bldg 20D-213, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA. - E-mail: dst@cs.cmu.edu 0954-898X/96/040671+15$19.50 c fl 1996 IOP Publishing Ltd 671 672 A D Redish et al <ref> [11, 21, 23] </ref>. Visual motion cues allow the system to update its current representation based on observed angular velocity, while taking bearings off familiar landmarks provides the absolute heading information needed to correct for velocity integration errors. <p> The coupled attractor architecture of our model further predicts that the two representations will always be internally consistent and aligned with each other. When two or more HD cells have been recorded simultaneously, the difference between their preferred directions never changes <ref> [21, 23] </ref>. The attractor nature of our model accounts for this observation and suggests that even after injecting noise into postsubiculum, the difference in preferred direction between two simultaneously recorded cells will return to its original value. <p> These simplifying assumptions were made for the purpose of keeping the simulation tractable.

Reference-contexts: Although the two populations in PoS and ATN seem similar, Blair and Sharp [4] and Taube and Muller <ref> [24] </ref> have recently shown a difference between them: ATN cell activity is best correlated not with current head direction, but with head direction approximately 20-40 ms in the future. PoS head direction cells, on the other hand, are best correlated with the animal's current (or recent) head directiony. 1. <p> Blair [3] proposed a somewhat different shift register model in which clockwise and anticlockwise angular velocity modulated head direction cells (AVHD cells) in the reticular y Both Blair and Sharp [4] and Taube and Muller <ref> [24] </ref> report an optimal correlation of ATN activity with future head direction (about 37 ms in the future) and PoS activity with current head direction, but Blair and Sharp (personal communication) have recently revised their estimates, suggesting that although ATN activity still anticipates future head direction (by 24 ms), PoS activity <p> Given the parameters in table 1, the direction represented by the ATN:E population leads the direction represented by the PoS:E population by approximately 10 ms over a wide range of turning speeds. Although this is smaller than the 20-40 ms discrepancy reported in neurophysiological experiments <ref> [4, 24] </ref>, our model at least replicates the qualitative observation that ATN leads PoS. With further refinement, we hope to come closer to replicating the actual lead of ATN relative to the PoS population. 4. Predictions 4.1.

Reference-contexts: One solution might be to use a parallel shifter circuit that can shift by any amount in one step, as in [1] or <ref> [25] </ref>. However, this requires a large number of connections which becomes prohibitive for a fine-scale representation of direction; it also seems an awkward approach to dealing with continuously variable angular velocity inputs. Zhang [29] presents the first simulation results of a pure attractor model of the head direction system.

Reference-contexts: This probabilistic approximation of spiking behaviour can also be understood as a model of a neuronal population [15]; F j .s/ is then the fraction of neurons in population j firing at time s. Following [15], we rewrite these equations in a form similar to the Wilson-Cowan equations <ref> [28] </ref> by defining the synaptic drive S j .t / supplied by neuron j : S j .t / D 0 which can be written as a differential equation: t j dt The synaptic drive S j .t / of neuron j thus approaches the neuron's firing rate F j .t <p> Note that this time constant is the same as the time constant of the decay of the PSP ff function, and is thus a function of the presynaptic neuron, not the postsynaptic one. Synaptic drive can be interpreted as a coarse-grained time-average of the actual firing rate <ref> [15, 28] </ref> and is not necessarily a measurable neuronal property. It can be understood as the effect neuron j has on neuron i divided by the synaptic weight between them [15].

Reference-contexts: See figures 7 and 8 later for sample PoS and ATN tuning curves. These curves can also be modelled very closely by Gaussians with an average standard deviation of approximately 66 ffi <ref> [4, 29] </ref>. One way of interpreting the activity of these cells is as a distributed representation of the rat's current head direction. <p> However, this requires a large number of connections which becomes prohibitive for a fine-scale representation of direction; it also seems an awkward approach to dealing with continuously variable angular velocity inputs. Zhang <ref> [29] </ref> presents the first simulation results of a pure attractor model of the head direction system. He defines a Gaussian-shaped hill of activation and derives weights and an activation function that produce self-sustaining activity patterns of this form.
