Abstract: Stochastic gradient-based adaptive algorithms are developed for the optimization of Weighted Myriad Filters. Weighted Myriad Filters form a class of nonlinear filters, motivated by the properties of ff-stable distributions, that have been proposed for robust non-Gaussian signal processing in impulsive noise environments. The weighted myriad for an N-long data window is described by a set of non-negative weights fw i g N In this paper, necessary conditions are obtained for optimality of the filter weights under the mean absolute error criterion. An implicit formulation of the filter output is used to find an expression for the gradient of the cost function. Using instantaneous gradient estimates, an adaptive steepest-descent algorithm is then derived to optimize the weights. This algorithm involves a very simple update term that is computationally comparable to the update in the classical LMS algorithm. The robust performance of this adaptive algorithm is demonstrated through a computer simulation example involving lowpass filtering of a one-dimensional chirp

Reference-contexts: Several techniques have been proposed to combat impulsive noise and, more generally, to deal with uncertainties in the assumed statistical models. The presence of outliers can be viewed as arising from an uncertainty regarding the assumed model. Most of these methods are based on the theory of robust statistics <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. Robust signal processing techniques [7] are designed to perform well under nominal conditions and still be adequate when the signal and noise statistics deviate from the nominal model. <p> Defining (x; fi) 4 (x fi) 2 ]; we have ^ fi K = arg min fi P N i=1 (x i ; fi); which defines an M -estimator <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. For location estimates, (x; fi) is usually of the type (x fi), which is the case here. Interestingly, the myriad includes the mean as a limiting case, converging to the sample mean as K ! 1 [13]. <p> This leads to negligible updates. Thus, the algorithm is robust to outliers and also allows the weights to settle down. It is interesting to note that the function (u; ~) is related to the influence function of the myriad estimator (see <ref> [5, 6] </ref> for discussions on the influence function of an M -estimator).

Reference-contexts: Median filters, and their generalizations based on order statistics, have been widely used in image processing due to their ability to preserve edges and fine detail while rejecting outliers. Median and weighted median filters (WMF) <ref> [8] </ref> are derived to be optimal under the Laplacian noise distribution, which is more heavy-tailed than the Gaussian distribution and, therefore, more suited to model outliers.

The use of the ff-stable distribution as a statistical model is justified theoretically by two properties <ref> [9] </ref>. The first is the stability property: the sum of two independent stable random variables with the same characteristic exponent is also stable with the same characteristic exponent.

In <ref> [21] </ref>, we describe a simple and fast algorithm, using a fixed point search, to compute the filter output approximately. As K gets larger, the number of local minima of G (fi) decreases. <p> Algorithm I was implemented both without the so-called stabilization constant (i.e., a = 0) and with it (a = 1 K 2 = 1:0 as recommended in Section 4.2). The weighted myriad filter output in all cases was computed using the fixed point search algorithm described in <ref> [21] </ref>. The initial weights for the linear filter were all chosen to be zero: w (0) = 0.
