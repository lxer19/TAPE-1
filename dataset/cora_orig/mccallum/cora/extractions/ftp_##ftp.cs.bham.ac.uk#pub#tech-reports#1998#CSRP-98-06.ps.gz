Abstract: Technical Report: CSRP-98-6 January 1998 Abstract This paper first analyses the impact of variance on schema transmission. Working from an exact derivation of the expected variance in schema transmission, it derives and analyses the signal-to-noise ratio for schemata. The paper then presents short term schema transmission probability results that focus on newly created schemata in the population. The analysis reveals the relative dependencies between schema transmission, population size, schema measured fitness, schema fragility and schema creation.

Reference-contexts: Schema Theorem (see [Holland, 1992] and [Goldberg, 1989]) in its original presentation and interpretation presents many technical difficulties, the GA and GP communities have gained a great deal of analytic knowledge by challenging it and coming to understand both its inadequacies and its content (see for example [Grefenstette, 1993] and <ref> [Altenberg, 1995] </ref>). As recently as December of 1997 schema understanding, in the context of crossover analysis and the building block hypothesis, was a topic of discussion on the genetic programming list [GP-List, 1997].

Reference-contexts: As recently as December of 1997 schema understanding, in the context of crossover analysis and the building block hypothesis, was a topic of discussion on the genetic programming list <ref> [GP-List, 1997] </ref>. It seems that (rightfully) each researcher has a unique perspective on the usefulness of schema analysis, the validity of the building block hypothesis and the relationship between the two.

Reference-contexts: While a schema theorem makes a prediction (as an expectation) one generation time step in advance and only focuses on one schema at a time, schema processing accounts yield valuable insights. Schema analysis can also be combined with experimentation to yield a substantiated and further improved account of GP <ref> [Poli and Langdon, 1997a] </ref>. Schema analysis does not lead to one "correct" GP schema theorem.

Reference-contexts: Schema analysis does not lead to one "correct" GP schema theorem. Different GP schema definitions and formulations of schema theorems should not be seen as competitive but should be intellectually organised so as to distinguish the significant properties and issues of focus that each author tried to address <ref> [Poli and Langdon, 1998] </ref>. To date, GP schema research has offered different schema definitions [Koza, 1992, O'Reilly and Oppacher, 1995, Whigham, 1995, Poli and Langdon, 1997b, Rosca, 1997] and different Schema Theorems. <p> allows only one or more than one schema instance to appear in a program, the resulting schema theorem expresses a lower bound on either the expected number of programs sampling a schema or the expected number of instances of the schema in the population from one generation to the next <ref> [Poli and Langdon, 1998] </ref>. In this paper our results concerning schemata fall into two areas and are independent of a particular schema definition. <p> Let p s min (H; t) be the minimum of p s (H; t). This is normally known in each schema theory thanks to probabilistic calculations on the likelihood of schema disruption (see for example <ref> [Poli and Langdon, 1998] </ref>).
