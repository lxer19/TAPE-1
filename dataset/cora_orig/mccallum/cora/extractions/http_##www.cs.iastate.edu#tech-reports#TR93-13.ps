Abstract: A weak completeness phenomenon is investigated in the complexity class E = DTIME(2 linear ). According to standard terminology, a lan guage H is P m hard for E if the set P m (H), consisting of all languages A P m H, contains the entire class E. A language C is P m complete for E if it is P m -hard for E and is also an element of E. Generalizing this, a language H is weakly P m hard for E if the set P m (H) does not have measure 0 in E. A language C is weakly P m complete for E if it is weakly P m -hard for E and is also an element of E. The main result of this paper is the construction of a language that is weakly P m -complete, but not P m -complete, for E. The existence of such languages implies that previously known strong lower bounds on the complexity of weakly P The proof of this result introduces a new diagonalization method, called martingale diagonalization. Using this method, one simultaneously develops an infinite family of polynomial time computable martingales (betting strategies) and a corresponding family of languages that defeat these martingales (prevent them from winning too much money) while also pursuing another agenda. Martingale diagonaliza tion may be useful for a variety of applications. fl This research was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant CCR-9157382, with matching funds from Rockwell International and Microware Systems Corporation.

Reference-contexts: A language H that is P m -hard for E is clearly intractable in the sense that H =2 P, i.e., H is not decidable in polynomial time. This is because a well-known diagonalization argument <ref> [3] </ref> shows that there is a language B 2 E P. Since B 2 E, it must be the case that B P m H.

Reference-contexts: A more interesting, and perhaps harder, question concerns alternate versions of the Main Theorem in which P m is replaced by other reducibilities. Homer, Kurtz, and Royer <ref> [5] </ref> have proven that a language is P 1tt -hard for E if and only if it is P m -hard for E. It follows immediately that the language C given by the Main Theorem is weakly P 1tt -complete, but not P 1tt -complete, for E.

Reference-contexts: Lutz [9] proposed to remedy this limitation by weakening the requirement that H be P m -hard for E in such results. To be more specific, given a language H, the P m span of H (also called the lower P m -span of H <ref> [7] </ref>) is the set P m (H) = A f0; 1g fl fi m H ; consisting of all languages that are polynomial time many-one reducible to H. <p> ff &lt; 1) is dense. (B 0 ) The method of [11] extends in a straightforward matter to show that, for every weakly P m -hard language H for E and every language A 2 P, the symmetric difference A 4 H is dense.

(This condition, defined in section 2, implies immediately that K is a dense polynomial complexity core of H.)

The proof of the Main Theorem also makes essential use of a recent theorem of Juedes and Lutz <ref> [7] </ref>, which gives a nontrivial upper bound on the complexities of P m -hard languages for E. Section 2 presents basic notation and definitions. <p> The following result is used here. Theorem 4.2 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [7] </ref>). No language that is P m -hard for E is incompressible by DTIME (2 4n ) m -reductions. Since almost every language (and almost every language in E) is incom pressible by DTIME (2 4n ) m -reductions [7], Theorem 4.2 says that the P m -hard languages are "unusually <p> Theorem 4.2 (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [7] </ref>).

Since almost every language (and almost every language in E) is incom pressible by DTIME (2 4n ) m -reductions [7], Theorem 4.2 says that the P m -hard languages are "unusually simple" in at least this one respect. <p> For example, recent work has shown that, if SAT is weakly P m -complete for E, then NP contains P-bi-immune languages [14], every P m -hard language for NP is dense [11], every P m -complete language for NP has a dense exponential complexity core <ref> [7] </ref>, and there is a language that is P T -complete, but not P m -complete, for NP [12].

Reference-contexts: In fact, it is easily checked that S 1 [d] contains exactly every language A for which the quantity #(0; A [0::n 1]) log 3 is unbounded as n ! 1, where #(0; w) denotes the number of 0's in the string w. Martingales were used extensively by Schnorr <ref> [19, 20, 21, 22] </ref> in his investigation of random and pseudorandom sequences. Lutz [10, 8] used martingales that are computable in polynomial time to characterize sets that have measure 0 in E. Since martingales are real-valued, their computations must employ finite approximations of real numbers.

(B) Schoning <ref> [23] </ref> and Huynh [6] have shown that every P m -hard language H for E is hard to approximate in the sense that, for every language A 2 P, the symmetric difference A 4 H is dense. (Note that this immediately implies result (A) above.) (C) Orponen and Schoning [16] have

Reference-contexts: larger class| is efficiently reducible to H. (See [25] for a survey of such arguments.) For example, some problems involving the existence of winning strategies for certain two-person combinatorial games are known to be intractable because they are polynomial time many-one hard (in fact, logarithmic space many-one complete) for E <ref> [24] </ref>. Briefly, a language H is polynomial time many-one hard (abbreviated P m - hard ) for E if every language A 2 E is polynomial time many-one reducible to H (abbreviated A P m H).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In practice to date, proving that a decision problem (i.e., language) H f0; 1g fl is computationally intractable usually amounts to proving that every member of the complexity class E = DTIME (2 linear )|or some larger class| is efficiently reducible to H. (See <ref> [25] </ref> for a survey of such arguments.) For example, some problems involving the existence of winning strategies for certain two-person combinatorial games are known to be intractable because they are polynomial time many-one hard (in fact, logarithmic space many-one complete) for E [24].
