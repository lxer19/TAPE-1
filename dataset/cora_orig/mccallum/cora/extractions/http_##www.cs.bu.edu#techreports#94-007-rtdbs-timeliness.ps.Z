Title: Timeliness via Speculation for Real-Time Databases

Abstract: Various concurrency control algorithms differ in the time when conflicts are detected, and in the way they are resolved. In that respect, the Pessimistic and Optimistic Concurrency Control (PCC and OCC) alternatives represent two extremes. PCC locking protocols detect conflicts as soon as they occur and resolve them using blocking. OCC protocols detect conflicts at transaction commit time and resolve them using rollbacks (restarts). For real-time databases, blockages and rollbacks are hazards that increase the likelihood of transactions missing their deadlines. We propose a Speculative Concurrency Control (SCC) technique that minimizes the impact of blockages and rollbacks. SCC relies on the use of added system resources to speculate on potential serialization orders and to ensure that if such serialization orders materialize, the hazards of blockages and roll-backs are minimized. We present a number of SCC-based algorithms that differ in the level of speculation they introduce, and the amount of system resources (mainly memory) they require. We show the performance gains (in terms of number of satisfied timing constraints) to be expected when a representative SCC algorithm (SCC-2S) is adopted. Keywords: real-time databases; concurrency control; performance evaluation; simulation; client-server distributed databases.

Reference-contexts: Each transaction in the system is assumed to preserve the consistency of the shared database. Therefore, any sequential (or serializable) execution of any collection of transactions will also preserve the consistency of the database <ref> [Papa79, Bern87] </ref>. <p> Write-write conflicts (when both a ir and a js actions are write operations) are treated using the Thomas' Write Rule (TWR). At validation, when all database updates are made permanent, all write requests are buffered by the data manager and serialized according to their transaction validation order <ref> [Bern87] </ref>. SCC algorithms allow several processes to co-exist on behalf of the same transaction. Each one of these processes makes different assumptions with regard to the Speculated Order of Serialization (SOS). For a transaction T i , we call each one of these processes a shadow of T i . <p> Its edges are all T i T j , for i 6= j, such that one of T i 's operations precedes and conflicts with one of T j 's operations in H. A history H is serializable if and only if its serialization graph SG (H) is acyclic <ref> [Bern87] </ref>. Lemma 1 Let T 1 and T 2 be two committed transactions in a history H produced by the SCC-kS algorithm.

Reference-contexts: However, like the classical OCC approach, it is not sensitive to transactions' priorities or deadlines. This has been partially remedied by introducing waiting [Hari90] and blocking [Lin90, Son92] to OCC-based algorithms. Recently Bestavros proposed a categorically different approach to concurrency control for RTDBS <ref> [Best92] </ref>. His approach relies on the use of standby processes to speculate on alternative schedules (serialization order of transactions), once conflicts that threaten the consistency of the database are detected. These alternative schedules are adopted only if suspected inconsistencies materialize; otherwise, they are abandoned.

Reference-contexts: Figure 2 demonstrates this concept by showing all shadows and SOS's for a transaction T 3 , which conflicts with two other transactions T 1 and T 2 . In <ref> [Best93a] </ref>, an Order-Based SCC (SCC-OB) algorithm, which generalizes this idea, is proposed. The SCC-OB algorithm requires an exponential number of shadows, namely P n (n1)! to account for all the possible orderings of any n uncommitted, conflicting transactions.

Reference-contexts: This is because the conflict is detected on some other transaction's write operation. Therefore, since its optimistic shadow already read that database object, we must either create a new copy of this transaction or choose another point during its execution from which we can fork it off <ref> [Best93b] </ref>. When the new conflict implicates transactions that already conflict with each other, some adjustments may be necessary.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Traditional concurrency control algorithms can be classified broadly as either pessimistic or optimistic. Pessimistic Concurrency Control (PCC) algorithms [Eswa76, Gray76] avoid any concurrent execution of transactions as soon as potential conflicts between these transactions are detected. Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) algorithms <ref> [Boks87, Kung81] </ref> allow such transactions to proceed at the risk of having to restart them in case these potential conflicts materialize.

Reference-contexts: Accordingly, they don't need to keep a number of shadows accounting for each one of these serialization orders. Rather, they need only to be concerned about the immediate future|which transaction will commit next| accounting for conflicts encountered with other uncommitted transactions. The Conflict-Based SCC (SCC-CB) variant presented in <ref> [Brao94] </ref> makes use of the aforementioned improvements over the SCC-OB algorithm. 4 (a) (c) 3 The SCC-kS Class of Algorithms In this section, we describe a class of SCC algorithms that operate under a limited resources assumption. <p> LBFO is one of several policies that could be adopted. We are currently investigating alternatives to this policy, which utilize information about deadlines and priorities of the conflicting transactions to account for the most probable serialization orders <ref> [Brao94] </ref>. are alloted for transaction T 1 . The presumption that the first two conflicts in which T 1 participated (by accessing objects Y and Z), is revised when transaction T 2 writes object X. <p> The objective of this scheme is to maximize the expected value-added to the system, and not necessarily the number of satisfied timing constraints <ref> [Brao94] </ref>. 18 5 Conclusion SCC allows several shadow transactions to co-exist on behalf of a given uncommitted transaction so as to protect against the hazards of blockages and restarts, which are characteristics of PCC-based and OCC-based algorithms, respectively.

Reference-contexts: OCC-BC detects conflicts earlier than the basic OCC algorithm resulting in less wasted resources and earlier restarts. However, like the classical OCC approach, it is not sensitive to transactions' priorities or deadlines. This has been partially remedied by introducing waiting <ref> [Hari90] </ref> and blocking [Lin90, Son92] to OCC-based algorithms. Recently Bestavros proposed a categorically different approach to concurrency control for RTDBS [Best92]. His approach relies on the use of standby processes to speculate on alternative schedules (serialization order of transactions), once conflicts that threaten the consistency of the database are detected. <p> A transaction that completes after its deadline has a tardiness of C T D T , where C T and D T are the transaction's completion time and deadline time, respectively. Previous studies have argued that improving both of the aforementioned metrics is difficult <ref> [Hari90] </ref>. Our simulations have shown that by adopting a superior concurrency control algorithm (SCC-2S in this case), both metrics can, indeed, be improved. Our experiments assume that transaction deadlines are soft. This entails that late transactions (those missing their deadlines) must complete nevertheless- with the minimum possible delay. <p> The database consisted of 1,000 pages from which each transaction accessed 20 pages randomly. The probability of a page been updated was set at 25%. These parameter settings are comparable to those used in similar studies <ref> [Hari90] </ref>. Figures 9-a and 9-b depict the average number of transactions that missed their deadlines, and the extra time needed by late transactions those missing their deadlines to complete their operations, respectively. The performance of both algorithms is identical when the number of transactions in the system is small. <p> We have developed an extension of SCC-2S that uses information about transaction deadlines to decide whether a validating transaction should be committed immediately, or whether its commitment should be delayed in favor of more urgent, conflicting transactions. This delay is similar to the waiting introduced in the Wait-50 heuristic <ref> [Hari90] </ref>, except that we apply it to SCC-2S instead of OCC-BC. Initial investigation of this heuristic suggests only minor improvement over the original SCC-2S.
