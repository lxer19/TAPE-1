Date: November 3, 1997:  Abstract  
Abstract: An architecture is presented in which distributed decision-making processes cooperatively determine a mobile robots path by sending votes to a centralized arbiter. One type of arbiter defined within this DAMN architecture performs command fusion to select that action which best satisfies the combined behavior votes, allowing multiple goals and constraints to be considered simultaneously. Another type of arbiter performs action selection via utility fusion. Within the utility fusion framework, behaviors indicate the utility of various possible world states and the arbiter determines the next action based on the maximization of expected utility. Thus, DAMN performs centralized arbitration of votes from distributed behaviors and in so doing provides coherent, rational, goal-directed behavior while preserving real-time responsiveness to its immediate physical environment

Reference-contexts: If the output from a lower level is inhibited, or if its input data is suppressed so that it is acting upon data for which it was not developed, then any assurance of performance and capability which that level previously provided can no longer be relied upon. Hierarchical architectures <ref> [Albus et al., 1987] </ref> are another type of distributed system in which the modules are organized into multiple control levels that operate at varying granularities, levels of abstraction, and time scales.

Reference-contexts: Although all votes must pass through the command arbiter before an action is taken, the function provided by the arbiter is fairly simple and does not represent the centralized bottleneck of more traditional systems. While the Motor Schema framework <ref> [Arkin, 1989] </ref> also offers a means of fusing commands from multiple behaviors, it suffers from the well known problem of local minima in potential fields.

Reference-contexts: A careful balance must be struck between completeness and optimality on the one hand versus modularity and efficiency on the other. Frameworks such as the Subsumption Architecture <ref> [Brooks, 1986] </ref> and Gapps [Rosenschein & Kaelbling, 1986] arbitrate among behaviors by explicitly or implicitly assigning priorities to each behavior; of all the behaviors issuing commands, the one with the highest priority is in control and the rest are ignored.

Reference-contexts: Centralized mobile robot systems operate by gathering all available sensory data, creating a complete model of its static environment, planning an optimal series of actions within the context of that model, and then executing that plan <ref> [Durrant-Whyte, 1986; Moravec, 1990; Nilsson, 1984; Shafer et al., 1986] </ref>. The robot would then gather more information and the process would repeat.

Reference-contexts: In most hybrid architectures, an intermediate level also appears between the high level symbolic reasoning of the deliberative planner and the low level numerical computations of the reactive planner operating at the actuator control level <ref> [Gat, 1992] </ref>. In hierarchical and hybrid architectures, the design and operation of the robot control system are expected to proceed in a top-down manner; each level controls the level beneath it and assumes that its commands will execute as anticipated.

Reference-contexts: This is similar to defuzzification in Fuzzy Logic control systems <ref> [Lee, 1990; Kamada et al., 1990] </ref>; indeed an architecture has been implemented which recasts this type of DAMN arbitration into a Fuzzy Logic framework [Yen & Puger, 1992].

Reference-contexts: For example, ALVINN [Pomerleau, 1992] uses an artificial neural network to associate video images of roads with appropriate steering directions and has been one of the most successful road following systems to date, yet it has been less successful than other systems such as Smarty <ref> [Langer et al., 1994] </ref> which use range data for the purpose of obstacle avoidance. Thus, by requiring a single representation for all sensor and map data, a centralized architecture does not allow specialized modules to use other representations and algorithms best suited to the task at hand. <p> An ERIM laser range finder generated a polar map of sensed depth every 500ms. This range image was then processed to create a Cartesian depth map which was used to determine the presence and location of obstacles, a process that took approximately 300ms to complete <ref> [Langer et al., 1994] </ref>. <p> Figure 8b shows the actual path recorded during the experiment projected on the average ground plane, as well as the obstacle regions shown as black dots and the intermediate goal points shown as small circles.

Reference-contexts: Centralized mobile robot systems operate by gathering all available sensory data, creating a complete model of its static environment, planning an optimal series of actions within the context of that model, and then executing that plan <ref> [Durrant-Whyte, 1986; Moravec, 1990; Nilsson, 1984; Shafer et al., 1986] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The robot would then gather more information and the process would repeat. This approach has the advantage of being able to combine evidence to overcome ambiguities and noise inherent in the sensing process <ref> [Moravec & Elfes, 1985] </ref>, but has the disadvantage of creating a computationally expensive sensory bottleneck; all sensor data must be collected and integrated before it can be acted upon. A single monolithic world model is also more difficult to develop, maintain, and extend.

Reference-contexts: Hybrid architectures have also been proposed as a means to combine the complementary strengths and weaknesses of deliberative and reactive architectures <ref> [Payton, 1986] </ref>. Hybrid architectures consist of layers, each composed of different reasoning elements operating within various paradigms. At the top level is a deliberative planner which assimilates all available information and creates long-term global plans to be used by the lower levels.

Reference-contexts: In an unstructured, unknown, or dynamic environment, this approach introduces complexities and inefficiencies which could be avoided if higher level modules participated in the decision-making process without assuming that their commands will be strictly followed <ref> [Payton et al., 1990] </ref>. <p> Higher-level planners are instantiated as behaviors and send votes to the arbiter just as any other behavior would. Thus, plans are not used in a top-down fashion but rather as a source of advice, so that the exibility of the reactive level is preserved <ref> [Payton et al., 1990] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: If we assign a utility measure U (c) for each possible consequence of an action, then the expected utility for an action a is: where P (c|a,e) is the probability that consequence c will occur, given that we have observed evidence e and taken action a <ref> [Pearl, 1988] </ref>. Thus, if we can define these utilities and probabilities, we can then apply the Maximum Expected Utility (MEU) criterion to select the optimal action based on our current information.

Reference-contexts: Another difficulty with sensor fusion is that information from disparate sources such as maps, sonar, and video, are generally not amenable to combination within a single representational framework that is suitable for planning such dissimilar tasks as following roads and avoiding obstacles. For example, ALVINN <ref> [Pomerleau, 1992] </ref> uses an artificial neural network to associate video images of roads with appropriate steering directions and has been one of the most successful road following systems to date, yet it has been less successful than other systems such as Smarty [Langer et al., 1994] which use range data for

Reference-contexts: However, one of the requirements for an intelligent planning and control system is that it be capable of satisfying multiple, possibly conicting goals <ref> [Simon, 1967] </ref>. While priority-based schemes are effective when choosing among incompatible commands, they do not provide an adequate means for dealing with multiple goals that can and should be satisfied simultaneously [Rosenblatt & Thorpe, 1995].

Reference-contexts: Since expectations are not always met, there is a need to monitor the progress of desired actions and to report failures as they occur <ref> [Simmons et al., 1990] </ref>. In an unstructured, unknown, or dynamic environment, this approach introduces complexities and inefficiencies which could be avoided if higher level modules participated in the decision-making process without assuming that their commands will be strictly followed [Payton et al., 1990].

This arbitration scheme provides a means by which commands can be combined, unlike action selection schemes that choose a single behaviors command to be used in controlling the robot.
