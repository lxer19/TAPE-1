Reference-contexts: We view the symbolic/non-symbolic relationship as a dynamic and interactive one and will explore ideas from developmental psychology and neuroscience in developing a model of symbolic acquisition for artificial agents. 2 The Motivation for a Hybrid Architecture Brooks 91 <ref> [1] </ref> has argued that the top down approach of classical planning founders on the problem of symbol grounding, ie that the high level operators and concepts have meaning only in the minds of human observers and may not be realisable by the sensorimotor systems of the artificial agent which is to <p> Brooks 91 <ref> [1] </ref> describes a reactive robot which wanders around looking for and collecting soft drink cans.

Reference-contexts: Acquisition of new or modified behaviours must initiate a new process of representational redescription, so that the symbolic level is itself dynamically extensible. An alternative approach to the design of sensorimotor substrates is offered by Edelman's neuronal group selection model (Edelman et al 92 <ref> [2] </ref>; Verschure 93 [5]). In this theory, environmentally interactive sensorimotor development is achieved through both genetically regulated and experiential selection amongst pre-existing synaptic connections.

Reference-contexts: Ad hoc engineering solutions like these may be acceptable when designing what will remain encapsulated behaviours, but cannot provide an adequate basis for the acquisition of grounded semantic primitives for perception and action in a symbolic architecture. Harnad 93 <ref> [3] </ref> has offered some interesting ideas on how grounded symbol acquisition can take place in an artificial agent.

Reference-contexts: To explain this focusses us on the very difficult question of the nature of the non-symbolic/symbolic interface. Our understanding of the dynamic nature of this relationship is inspired by recent work in cognitive development theory by Karmiloff-Smith 92 <ref> [4] </ref>.
