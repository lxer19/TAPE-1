Abstract: Two fundamental problems in analyzing DNA sequences are (1) locating the regions of a DNA sequence that encode proteins, and (2) determining the reading frame for each region. We investigate using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to find coding regions, determine reading frames, and detect frameshift errors in E. coli DNA sequences. We describe our adaptation of the approach used by Uberbacher and Mural to identify coding regions in human DNA, and we compare the performance of ANNs to several conventional methods for predicting reading frames. Our experiments demonstrate that ANNs can outperform these conventional approaches.

Reference-contexts: Artificial neural networks provide an approach to machine learning characterized by simple processing units linked to each other by weighted connections. The state of a unit at any given time is represented by its activation, which is typically a real-valued number in the range <ref> [0, 1] </ref>. The input layer of a network contains units whose activations represent feature values of the problem domain to which the ANN is being applied. The units in the output layer of a network represent the decisions made by the network. <p> This procedure is repeated four times so that each set is used as the testing set once. The networks are not trained on noncoding DNA sequences because it is problematic to isolate noncod-ing sequences of significant length. The E. coli genome is dense with coding regions <ref> [1] </ref>, and it is difficult to verify that what appears to be a noncoding region does not actually contain any genes. We have experimented with including some regions from the phage , which are believed to be noncoding, in our data sets.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As part of the Human Genome Initiative, a project has been established at the University of Wisconsin to determine the sequence of the genome of the bacterium E. coli <ref> [2] </ref>. The laboratory of Prof. F. Blattner is now sequencing large stretches of anonymous DNA that is, DNA whose function is not known. In order to understand this DNA, it is necessary to locate the genes in it, and to determine the reading frames of these genes.

Reference-contexts: Thus, when the window is positioned over a gene, and it is positioned so that it is in-frame, the triplets in the window will actually be codons in a gene. This approach has been used by others to find protein coding regions in human DNA <ref> [9, 3] </ref>. As shown in Figure 5, this representation requires sixty-four input units for a network with one output unit. Each unit represents a particular codon and its activation represents the number of occurrences of that codon in the window. <p> The performance of the networks with the codons representation is about the same as the performance of Staden method. We had expected the codons networks to outperform the Staden approach by representing some information concerning the joint probabilities of codons. Farber et al. <ref> [3] </ref> have found that perceptrons are able to do this for a similar task. Additionally, the results indicate that, for E. coli, the Staden algorithm is a better predictor of reading frames than a neural network trained using only the Uberbacher-Mural features.

Reference-contexts: neural networks to: 1. locate the coding regions in a DNA sequence, 2. determine the reading frame for coding regions, 3. detect frameshift errors in coding regions. 3 Conventional Approaches A number of methods have been developed that find genes and reading frames by exploiting statistical properties of coding regions <ref> [4, 5, 12] </ref>. Specifically, amino acid, codon, and nucleotide compositions can be measured and used to distinguish coding from non-coding regions. There are three factors which influence these compositions in sequences that encode a protein. First, some amino acids are used more frequently than others in proteins. <p> The reference matrix is constructed from a set of known genes. 2. Fickett values: An algorithm developed by Fick-ett <ref> [4] </ref> measures the A, C, G, and T-content of a sequence, and the degree to which each nucleotide is favored in each codon position. The Fickett algorithm weights these eight values to form a sin 5 gle score indicating the probability that the se-quence encodes a protein.

We also compare the performance of ANNs using these representations to two conventional approaches to reading frame prediction: the Staden and Gribskov algorithms. The Gribskov <ref> [5] </ref> algorithm is similar to the Staden approach; the primary difference is that the Gribskov method tries to factor out the amino-acid composition of the translated protein. As with the Uberbacher-Mural features, we have extended the Staden and Gribskov methods to consider both strands for a given window position.

There are many ways in which the nucleotides occupying the window can be represented as activations on the input units. Section 5 describes the representations that we investigate in our experiments.

Reference-contexts: Although this is a useful feature in analyzing eukaryotic DNA, it is not relevant to prokary-otic organisms such as E. coli. 6 Experimental Methodology The data that we use to evaluate our networks is taken from thirty E. coli genes. The BLAST program <ref> [10] </ref> was run on all pairs of genes in the data set to ensure that the presence of homologous genes would not distort training and testing accuracies. The criterion used to define homology is 50% identity when aligned at the protein level.

Each signal corresponds to a particular reading frame. The presence of a coding region in a sequence is indicated by a relatively high signal in one of the frames. Noncoding regions are indicated by relatively low signals in all frames. <p> Networks with six output units are trained to predict the codon position of the nucleotide in the center of the window. 4 Using ANNs to Predict Reading Frames As with the reading-frame determination method of Staden <ref> [12] </ref>, we train artificial neural networks to make predictions given a fixed-length window of the DNA sequence of interest. Artificial neural networks provide an approach to machine learning characterized by simple processing units linked to each other by weighted connections.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we describe how we have adapted the approach of Uberbacher and Mural <ref> [13] </ref> that identifies coding regions in human DNA. Uberbacher and Mural's neural network is used in the Gene Recognition and Analysis Internet Link (GRAIL) system. We have modified their approach to apply to lower organisms, whose gene structure is fundamentally different from that of humans. <p> For a network with six output units, it is necessary to represent the triplets in all six frames; hence 384 input units are used. Another input representation approach, depicted in Figure 6, is that of Uberbacher and Mural <ref> [13] </ref>, who have described and investigated seven feature extractors that they use to locate coding regions in human DNA. We have adapted the approach of Uber-bacher and Mural to prokaryotes, or organisms, such as E. coli, that lack nuclei. <p> While Uberbacher and Mural use the single Fickett score, we use the content and codon position values as input features so that a network can develop its own weighting. 3. Dinucleotide fractal dimension: The transitions in the frequencies of sequential dinucleotides can be characterized by a fractal dimension <ref> [13, 7] </ref>. We calculate this dimension for the dinucleotides occurring on both strands in the input window and subtract from each value the fractal dimen sion of a set of noncoding reference strands. 4.

A DNA strand is a linear sequence of nucleotides composed from the alphabet fA, G, T, Cg. A DNA molecule comprises two strands organized as a double helix. Certain subsequences of a DNA strand, called genes or coding regions, encode proteins.
