Abstract: The Albert Nonassociative Algebra System: A Progress Report Abstract After four years of experience with the nonassociative algebra program Albert, we highlight its successes and drawbacks. Among its successes are the discovery of several new results in nonassociative algebra. Each of these results has been independently verified either with a traditional mathematical proof or with an independent computation.

Reference-contexts: Computers were used to study nonassociative algebras as early as the 1960's. The 1976 annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society in San Antonio held a special session on Computers in the Study of Nonassociative Rings and Algebras. The proceedings of this session <ref> [2] </ref> contain many computer applications by Kleinfeld, Hentzel, Luks, and others (e.g. [14], [16], [4]). The main problem addressed by Albert is the recognition of nonassociative polynomial identities. A fundamental problem asks whether an algebra must satisfy a certain identity, assuming that it satisfies another given set of identities.

Obviously, any binary operation that is both commutative and associative must satisfy identity (8). However, surprisingly, the converse is very nearly true. For the moment let us consider groupoids (i.e. nonempty sets with a single binary operation).

The main problem addressed by Albert is the recognition of nonassociative polynomial identities. A fundamental problem asks whether an algebra must satisfy a certain identity, assuming that it satisfies another given set of identities. <p> Experience seems to show that recognizing identities that are implied by a set of defining identities is inherently difficult. One successful approach by Hentzel uses group representation theory <ref> [4] </ref>. Another way to solve the problem, however, is to construct the free algebra determined by the given set of defining identities; if the polynomial in question is zero in the free algebra then it is an identity. This is the approach taken by Albert.

Reference-contexts: In general a flexible algebra need not be commutative. While experimenting with Albert, we observed that, for characteristic 6= 2, if the algebra was generated by a single element, then flexibility and commutativity seemed to be equivalent. This led to the following theorem, proven in <ref> [5] </ref>. Theorem 2 Let A be an algebra over a field of character istic 6= 2. Then A is commutative if and only if it is flexible and generated by a set S whose elements pairwise commute. Also given in [5] is a counterexample showing that "characteristic 6= 2" is necessary. <p> This led to the following theorem, proven in <ref> [5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This experience suggests a top-down methodology whereby the researcher first sketches out a "high-level" proof using a sequence of unproven lemmas. Next, using Albert, the lemmas are confirmed. Finally, being confident of their truth, the researcher seeks conventional proofs. A description of this case study can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. 5 Verification of the Miheev question Algebras satisfying (x; y; y) = 0 (11) are called right alternative. The right alternative identity, of course, is another generalization of associativity.

Reference-contexts: For example, 2-nice is equivalent to being commutative. Being both 2-nice and 3-nice is equivalent to being commutative and associative. Experiments with Albert suggested that in the presence of identity (8), an algebra's multiplication is 5-nice. This provided the needed courage to prove in <ref> [7] </ref> that Theorem 3 A groupoid satisfying (xy)z = y (zx) is k-nice for each k 5. Recall that an algebra is semiprime if I 2 6= 0 for any nonzero ideal I. Theorem 3 can then be used to prove the following theorem, which generalizes a result of Chen.

Reference-contexts: This led to the following theorem: Theorem 1 Let A be a commutative algebra over a field having characteristic 6= 2; 3 and satisfying x 3 = 0. Then A satisfies (((a b )c )d )e = 0: (6) Theorem 1 has been independently confirmed by another computational method <ref> [8] </ref>. Although interesting in its own right, the result is critical to understanding the structure of Bernstein algebras [8]. In the remainder of this paper we shall identify some other successes of Albert in the last several years, as well as pinpoint some weaknesses. <p> Then A satisfies (((a b )c )d )e = 0: (6) Theorem 1 has been independently confirmed by another computational method <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In the remainder of this paper we shall identify some other successes of Albert in the last several years, as well as pinpoint some weaknesses. The method employed for constructing the free algebra is a dynamic programming algorithm described in <ref> [9] </ref>. For a fixed set a defining identities, the algorithm runs in time that is polynomial in the total degree of the target polynomial and the dimension of the resulting algebra. This is somewhat misleading, since the dimension usually grows ex ponentially with the degree of the target polynomial.

Finally, another opportunity for improvement might be a graphical user-interface. It is known that random substitution methods can be used to decide if a given finite dimensional algebra satisfies a certain identity <ref> [13] </ref>. But can random methods be used for the varietal problem described in this paper? Albert is written in about 13,000 lines of C, and is free.

Reference-contexts: The right alternative identity, of course, is another generalization of associativity. The well-known Cayley algebras (see [20]) satisfy this identity (along with its counterpart the left alternative law.) In <ref> [17] </ref>, Miheev proved that any right alternative algebra also satisfies (y; y; x) = 0; but, in general, (y; y; x) 6= 0: The question remained whether (y; y; x) 3 = 0.

An algebra is prime if IJ 6= 0 for any two nonzero ideals I and J.

Reference-contexts: Albert is a relatively small program with a simple user interface. It has no programming capability, and its problem domain is quite narrow compared with general purpose computer algebra systems like Maple, or automatic theorem provers like Isabelle <ref> [19] </ref>. Albert is interactive, and works in the following way. Suppose a person wishes to study commutative algebras with nilindex 3.

Reference-contexts: Paul showed that Theorem 5 (Paul) Any prime algebra satisfying both (9) and (10) is either associative or else its nucleus and center coincide. This theorem is part of a broad collection of related results providing sufficient conditions for an algebra to be commutative or associative (e.g. <ref> [22] </ref>). Without defining "nucleus" and "center", the reader sees that Paul's theorem is clouded by the two possibilities appearing in the conclusion, and is therefore somewhat unsatisfying. Theorem 6, shown below, was proven with the help of Albert. It generalizes Paul's result in two ways.

Reference-contexts: At present, our algorithm depends on a linearized defining identity. Hence, this problem requires further study. More generally, the theory of nonassociative R-algebras can be developed over arbitrary commutative rings R with unity <ref> [23] </ref>. Can the methods employed by Albert be extended to this setting? Another improvement would be in the case when f is found to be an identity, and allow the system to emit a real proof of this fact.
