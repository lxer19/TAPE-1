Title: Error Bounds for Nondifferentiable Convex Inequalities under a Strong Slater Constraint Qualification  
Author: O. L. Mangasarian 
Keyword: Key Words. Convex inequalities, error bounds, Strong Slater constraint qualification. Abbreviated Title. Error bounds under a strong Slater CQ  
Abstract: Mathematical Programming Technical Report 96-04 July 1996 Revised March 1997 Abstract A global error bound is given on the distance between an arbitrary point in the n-dimensional real space R n and its projection on a nonempty convex set determined by m convex, possibly nondifferentiable, inequalities. The bound is in terms of a natural residual that measures the violations of the inequalities multiplied by a new simple condition constant that embodies a single strong Slater constraint qualification (CQ) which implies the ordinary Slater CQ. A very simple bound on the distance to the projection relative to the distance to a point satisfying the ordinary Slater CQ is given first and then used to derive the principal global error bound.

Reference-contexts: Any example violating the Slater CQ also violates the Strong Slater CQ. However it is not easy to construct an example violating the Strong Slater CQ but not the Slater CQ. In fact this is essentially one of the open challenges also posed by Klatte and Li <ref> [5] </ref>. 4 Conclusion By bounding Lagrange multipliers of the problem of projecting an arbitrary point on a given convex set by means of a Slater or strong Slater constraint qualification, global error bounds on the relative and absolute distances to the convex set were obtained in terms of a natural residual <p> The author is also indebted to a referee for pointing out that after the completion of this paper, Klatte and Li <ref> [5] </ref> showed that under the Slater CQ, the Strong Slater CQ 3.2 is equivalent to the Asymptotic CQ of Auslender and Crouzeix [2].
