Abstract: Task-reconfigurable robots consist of a set of one or more identical autonomous modules that can adapt their shape and function to tasks. We describe a module that can function as a climbing robot, a manipulator, or a leg in a multi-legged walker. This module can make autonomous transitions between these states. We present the control algorithms that enable our robot to be a versatile navigator and manipulator and report on our experimental results.

Reference-contexts: Higher-level control is performed by a remote workstation which communicates with the microcontroller via a 38.4k baud serial link. This gives the Inchworm the properties of a remote-brained system, as outlined in <ref> [Ina93] </ref>. The Inchworm is powered by lead-acid batteries. The batteries are not located on the body of the Inch worm due to weight constraints.

Reference-contexts: Thus, such a system has the ability to cooperate as a unit or as a distributed system of robots. In this paper we describe our progress towards this class of robots. Specifically, we show how our Inchworm robot <ref> [KR96] </ref> can be an autonomous navigator of three-dimensional structures, a manipulator, and a multi-legged walker. The function of the Inchworm as an autonomous navigator of three dimensional structures, regardless of the presence, absence, or direction of gravitation was reported in [KR96]. <p> Specifically, we show how our Inchworm robot <ref> [KR96] </ref> can be an autonomous navigator of three-dimensional structures, a manipulator, and a multi-legged walker. The function of the Inchworm as an autonomous navigator of three dimensional structures, regardless of the presence, absence, or direction of gravitation was reported in [KR96]. <p> Task-reconfigurable robots can be viewed a minimalist approach to designing versatile and extensible navigators and manipulators. We advocate designing simple modules that can be shown to be robust, such as the Inchworm robot <ref> [KR96] </ref>. When these modules are autonomous robots, they can independently organize themselves as robust three-dimensional structures whose geometric configurations determine the resulting robot function. Such structures have built-in redundancy and are thus naturally fault-tolerant. One can imagine building robots that can self-organize as any three-dimensional autonomous structure. <p> The control algorithms are simple, compliant, adaptive, and reliable. A control hierarchy is used to par 3 tition the control into low-level skills, task-level primitives, and high-level navigation algorithms. Each level in the hierarchy consists of compositions of the functions in the lower levels. In <ref> [KR96] </ref> we discussed the skills used to perform low-level control of the Inchworm (attach, detach, level, height, raise, extend, lower-to-contact, and position). Refer to [KR96] for a description of each skill. Skills are composed to implement the Inchworm movement primitives step and transition. <p> Each level in the hierarchy consists of compositions of the functions in the lower levels.

In the next four sections, we present descriptions of the the movement primitives and the navigation algorithm (step, concave-transition, and the navigation algorithm are discussed in greater detail in <ref> [KR96] </ref>). 4.1 Stepping The simplest task level primitive is the step. A step consists of two phases, the extension phase and the contraction phase. During the extension phase, the rear foot is attached to the surface. <p> that implements a move from one surface to another surface when the relative orientation between the surfaces ranges from 45 to 90 degrees relative to the first surface.

(Transitions to surfaces whose relative orientation is between -1 and -45 degrees are implemented as part of a step in the same way as for a concave transition as explained in <ref> [KR96] </ref>). <p> In order to implement convex-transition, it was necessary to increase the length of the middle two Inchworm segments from 80 millimeters as in <ref> [KR96] </ref> to the current length of 120 millimeters. This was required because convex-transition needs a greater reach than concave-transition. A consequence of increasing the segment lengths is an increased torque demand on the joint actuators, since at maximum extension the moment arm length is increased. <p> Leg 82 82 100.0 % lifting and placing, and straight-line pulling experiments.

This one-leg control can be replicated on three other Inchworms. <p> We intend to add a sensor to overcome this limitation. globally-controlled leg algorithm. These tasks were components of the straight-line pulling experiment. Each pulling experiment included at least two step tasks, and this data was added to the data presented in <ref> [KR96] </ref>. The result is 246 successful steps out of 236 tries. The globally-controlled leg data consists of data for the stride component of the pulling experiment.
