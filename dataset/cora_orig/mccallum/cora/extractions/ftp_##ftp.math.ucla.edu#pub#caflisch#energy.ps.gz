Abstract: For weak solutions of the incompressible Euler equations, there is energy conservation if the velocity is in the Besov space B 3 s with s greater than 1=3: B p s consists of functions that are Lip(s) (i.e., Holder continuous with exponent s) measured in the L p norm. Here this result is applied to velocities with a specified singularity spectrum which is spatially uniform in a sense made precise below. Such velocities are, roughly speaking, Lip(ff) on sets of Hausdorff co-dimension (ff) for a range of values of ff. We show that the Frisch-Parisi multifractal formalism is valid for this function class, and that there is energy conservation if min ff (3ff + (ff)) &gt; 1. Analogous conservation results are derived for the equations of incompressible ideal MHD (i.e., zero viscosity and resistivity) for both energy and helicity . In addition, a necessary condition is derived for singularity development in ideal MHD generalizing the Beale-Kato-Majda condition for ideal hydrodynamics.

Reference-contexts: The Frisch-Parisi formalism was verified for a class of functions based on a wavelet construction by Eyink [9] and for functions obeying a refinement equation by Daubechies and Lagarias [7]. Bacry, Muzy and Arneodo <ref> [1] </ref> developed an alternative multifractal formalism based on wavelets. On the other hand, Jaf-fard [11] showed that neither of these two formalisms gives a generally correct characterization of the usual singularity spectrum. <p> This is exactly the formula for s p in the Frisch-Parisi formalism, which shows validity of the Frisch-Parisi formalism for this function class. 2.4 Energy Conservation for Ideal Hydrodynamics For simplicity assume that D = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 3 with periodic boundary conditions. <p> The following energy conservation theorem for ideal hydrodynamics is a consequence of Corollary 2.1 and the theorem of [5]. Corollary 2.2 (Energy Conservation for Euler). Let u be a weak solution of the Euler equations on D = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 3 . Suppose that u 2 C ([0; T ]; B (D)) in which B (D) = Lip (ff n ; n ) or L = Lip ([ff ; ff + ]; ()). <p> In analogy to the conservation of energy for the Euler equations, energy conservation for ideal MHD holds if Z dx = D ju (x ; 0)j 2 + jb (x ; 0)j 2 for t 2 [0; T ]. For simplicity we assume that D = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> n . Whereas singularity formation and energy dissipation is only possible for three-dimensional hydro dynamics, for MHD it is a possibility for dimension n = 2 or n = 3. Theorem 3.1 (Energy Conservation for Ideal MHD). <p> Theorem 3.1 (Energy Conservation for Ideal MHD). Let u and b be a weak solution of the ideal MHD equations in D = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> n . Suppose that u 2 C ([0; T ]; B ff 1 3 ) 3 ). If ff 1 + 2ff 2 &gt; 1 (3.3) then (3.2) holds. Proof. The proof follows that of [5] but will be briefly repeated here. <p> Using arguments identical to those of the previous proof we obtain Theorem 3.2 (Magnetic Helicity Conservation for Ideal MHD). Let u and b be a weak solution of the ideal MHD equations in D = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> n . Suppose that u 2 C ([0; T ]; B ff 1 3 ). If ff 1 + 2ff 2 &gt; 0, then (3.9) holds. In 2 dimensions the magnetic helicity vanishes identically. <p> In 2 dimensions, a satisfies (up to a gradient) a t + u ra = 0 and we have Theorem 3.3 . Let u and b be a weak solution of the ideal MHD equations in D = <ref> [0; 1] </ref> 2 . Suppose that u 2 C ([0; T ]; B ff 1 3 )and a 2 C ([0; T ]; B ff 2 +1 ff 1 + 2ff 2 &gt; 1, then R D a 2 dx is conserved. <p> The following theorem gives two variants of the previous energy conservation result for MHD. Theorem 3.4 (Energy Conservation for Ideal MHD in Characteristic Variables). For a weak solution of the MHD equations in <ref> [0; 1] </ref> n , there is energy conservation if either of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) For some p; q with values in (1; 1) and with 1=p + 2=q = 1 u 2 C ([0; T ]; B ff 0 p ) q ) (3.11) in which 3ff 0

Finally, we utilize an inequality derived in <ref> [2] </ref> and Gronwall's lemma to bound jz j s . 4.1 Energy Estimates We begin by deriving energy estimates for the system (3.10) with t 2 [0; T ].

Reference-contexts: The situation is similar for magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) at high Reynolds and magnetic Reynolds number <ref> [3] </ref>. Although the available evidence is not as clear-cut, energy dissipation is apparently constant in the ideal limit. In contrast, according to the Taylor conjecture, magnetic helicity does not dissipate in the ideal limit.

Reference-contexts: In 1949 Onsager [12] stated that energy is conserved for weak solutions u 2 Lip (ff) with ff &gt; 1=3. This result was stated in a famous paper that initiated the statistical theory of point vortices, and was apparently overlooked until the work of Eyink <ref> [8] </ref>, which gave it a rigorous mathematical proof in a certain function class. The proof was considerably simplified and extended to the Besov function space B p s (= B p;1 s ) in subsequent work of Constantin, E and Titi [5].
