Abstract: Flame sheet problems are on the natural route to the numerical solution of detailed chemistry, laminar diffusion flames, which, in turn, are important in many engineering applications. In order to model the flame structure more accurately, we use the vorticity-velocity formulation of the fluid flow equations instead of the more traditional stream function-vorticity approach. The numerical solution of the resulting nonlinear coupled elliptic partial differential equations involves damped Newton iterations, adaptive grid procedures, and multigrid methods. We focus on nonlinear damped Newton multigrid, using either one way or correction schemes. Results on serial and parallel processors are presented.

Reference-contexts: Vorticity-velocity allows for more accurate vorticity boundary conditions than stream function-vorticity, yields better conditioned Jacobians, uses nonstaggered grids, and extends easily to three dimensional problems [3]. A detailed formulation of the vorticity-velocity problem can be found in <ref> [2] </ref> and [3]. Define the velocity vector v = (v r ; v z ) with radial (v r ) and axial (v z ) components. The normal component of the vorticity is ! = @ @z v r @ @r v z . <p> We adopt a monotonicity preserving upwind scheme for the convective terms. The boundary conditions involve only zero or first order derivatives. For the latter terms, first order back or forward differences can be used, except for two boundary conditions which require a more accurate treatment (see <ref> [2] </ref> and [3] for more details). The vorticity inlet boundary condition is discretized using the vorticity values at the first two lines of the computational domain. <p> The process is repeated recursively until the problem on the finest grid is approximated well enough. Damped Newton multigrid methods also start on a coarse mesh. However, the Jacobians are saved for use in linear correction problems. See <ref> [2] </ref> for more details. Asymptotically, as the mesh spacing approaches zero, the interpolant of the computed solution on one grid lies in the convergence domain of the Newton method on the next finer grid.

Due to the nonlinearity of the original problem, a traditional time relaxation process is used to produce a parabolic in time problem and bring the starting estimate into the convergence domain of the Newton iteration (2).

This minimized the communication during the iterative solves. The Jacobians and nonlinear residuals are computed in a similar, parallel fashion (see <ref> [4] </ref> for more details). Table 4 contains the results (for Bi-CGSTAB/GS, the number of linear iterations for correction cycles on the finest level was increased 10% over the serial case). <p> As reflected in Table 4, we obtain parallel efficiencies in the range 70%-80% using 8 processors. Higher efficiencies should be obtained for detailed chemistry diffusion flame problems where most of the CPU time is spent in the time relaxation phase evaluating Jacobians <ref> [4] </ref>. 5. Conclusions. In this paper, we presented results for a new numerical procedure to solve flame sheet problems. The governing equations use the vorticity-velocity formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations coupled together with a conserved scalar equation.

Reference-contexts: The solutions are calculated on cheap, but fast workstations as well as on small parallel computers. In the present work, we consider a flame sheet problem <ref> [5] </ref> rather than a finite rate chemistry model for an axisymmetric laminar diffusion flame. This alleviates the memory and CPU requirements on the computer simulations. <p> In the flame sheet model <ref> [5] </ref>, the chemical reactions are described with a single one step irreversible reaction corresponding to infinitely fast conversion of reactants into stable products.
