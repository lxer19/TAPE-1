Abstract: Adults and children spontaneously produce gestures while they speak, and such gestures appear to support and expand on the information communicated by the verbal channel. Little research, however, has been carried out to examine the role played by gesture in the listener's representation of accumulating information? Do listeners attend to the gestures that accompany narrative speech? In what kinds of relationships between gesture and speech do listeners attend to the gestural channel? If listeners do attend to information received in gesture, how is this information representedis it 'tagged' as originating in the gestural channel? In this article research is described that addresses these questions. Results show that listeners do attend to information conveyed in gesture, when that information supplements or even contradicts the information conveyed by speech. And information received via gesture is available for retelling in speech. These results are taken to demonstrate that gesture is not taken by the listener to be epiphenomenal to the act of speaking, or a simple manual translation of speech. But they also suggest that the information conveyed in a discourse may be represented in a manner that is neither gesture nor language, although accessible to both channels.

Reference-contexts: These five examples of the role played by gesture in narrative are interesting because they demonstrate narrative functions that appear to be universally important, and that linguists have Page 5 attempted to tie to particular linguistic devices (Hopper, 1979; Hopper & Thompson, 1980), without much success <ref> ( Cassell & McNeill, 1990) </ref>. Because they exemplify the role played by gesture in the context of narrative speech, the narrative functions just described were the source for the creation of speech-gesture mismatches in the current study.

Reference-contexts: Page 4 Gesture Functions It has been shown that speakers produce these four types of gesture during conversations and when narrating stories, and that these gestures play particular roles in narrative <ref> (Cassell & McNeill, 1991) </ref>. In what follows, some of these narrative functions are described. 1. Iconic gestures may specify the manner in which an action is carried out, even if this information is not given in accompanying speech.

Reference-contexts: Our analyses of these data showed that in the actual study two speech-mismatched gestures must not be carried out one after the other, since it was then impossible to distinguish the effect of the two gestures in subjects retellings. In a second pilot study <ref> (described in McNeill, Cassell & McCullough, 1994) </ref> we reorganized the order of the mismatched and matched gestures, and again showed the stimuli to subjects. <p> In fact, in our own work, when we have had subjects listen to a narration without viewing the video image, we see just as much gesturing in the retelling as when we have subjects both listen to and watch the narration on the video screen <ref> (McNeill, Cassell & McCullough, 1994) </ref>. It is, however, more critical to the current argument to show that gestural information can give rise to linguistic. <p> We are attempting to carry this out by building an animated cartoon narrator in whom the temporal relationship between speech and gesture can be manipulated <ref> (Cassell et al., 1994) </ref>. Likewise, here we have concentrated on the role of gesture in comprehension and not on the relationship between gesture and speech in production. This latter is more difficult to examine experimentally.

Reference-contexts: For this reason we consider only gestures that cooccur most often in conjunction with speech. Thus, we exclude the emblematic gestures that can replace speech <ref> (Ekman & Friesen, 1969) </ref>. These gestures are culturally specified in the sense that a gesture may have a consistent interpretation that differs from culture to culture. Examples in American culture are the thumb-and-index-finger ring gesture that signals 'okay' or the 'thumbs up' gesture.

Reference-contexts: This explains why we find the strict temporal synchronization between the production of gesture and speech <ref> (Kendon, 1972) </ref>, the parallel semantic and pragmatic content of gesture and speech (McNeill, 1992), the simultaneous acquisition in children (Riseborough, 1982) and tendency for the two systems to break down in parallel ways in aphasics (Feyereisen, 1983; Pedelty, 1987).

Reference-contexts: Examples in American culture are the thumb-and-index-finger ring gesture that signals 'okay' or the 'thumbs up' gesture. Some cultures demonstrate much more consistent use of these emblems than others <ref> (Kendon, 1992) </ref>. This criterion also rules out gestures that only occur in the momentary absence of speech, for example 'word finding gestures' made when a speaker is engaging in a lexical search or when speech has failed (Butterworth & Beattie, 1978; Butterworth & Hadar, 1989).

Reference-contexts: This would be why gesture is produced when, for example, speaking on the telephone. Others argue the complementary position, that gesture is not communicative for the listener <ref> (Krauss, Morrel-Samuels, & Colasante, 1991) </ref>. Some researchers, however, reject the entire notion of a linear encoding and information processing model where a pre-verbal message is passed on to the language production module as input (Kendon, 1972; McNeill, 1992, to appear). <p> Although speakers do not appear to be able to recognize gestures that they have been exposed to previously, or to impute meanings to gestures when they are seen without their associated speech <ref> (Krauss et al., 1991) </ref>, adults do seem to be able to "read" children's knowledge states off of the gestures that they produce in the context of speech (Goldin-Meadow, Alibali & Church, 1992; Alibali, Flevares & Goldin-Meadow, 1994).

Reference-contexts: Such gestures in narrations accurately index the left and right location of events from cartoon or event stimuli <ref> (McCullough, 1992) </ref>. 4. Beat gestures: small baton like movements that do not change in form with the content of the accompanying speech. They serve a pragmatic function, occurring with comments on one's own linguistic contribution, speech repairs and reported speech. <p> This question may be addressed by looking at whether there was a difference in understanding of the narration between subjects in the two video version conditions, i.e. between subjects who heard the same speech but saw two different gestures. Analyses of pilot data <ref> (McNeill, 1992 and McNeill, Cassell & McCullough, 1994) </ref>, where only one video version was shown, led us to believe that effects of speech mismatched gestures could be traced in subjects subsequent retelling of the story.

Reference-contexts: This explains why we find the strict temporal synchronization between the production of gesture and speech (Kendon, 1972), the parallel semantic and pragmatic content of gesture and speech <ref> (McNeill, 1992) </ref>, the simultaneous acquisition in children (Riseborough, 1982) and tendency for the two systems to break down in parallel ways in aphasics (Feyereisen, 1983; Pedelty, 1987). <p> Such gestures are the most frequent type in many communicative situations, including the narrative discourse situation on which we base this article. Four types of such gestures have been shown to occur with narrative discourse <ref> (McNeill, 1992) </ref>. 1. Iconics depict by the form of the gesture some feature of the action or event being described; such as "he climbed up the pipe" accompanied by the hand rising upwards to show the path. 2. <p> These three types were included and designed on the basis of the first three narrative functions of gesture described above, and building on lessons learned from the data used in an earlier pilot study <ref> (described in McNeill, 1992, and below) </ref>. The three types of gesture-speech associations were 'anaphor', 'origo', and 'manner'. They are described below. 1. <p> & Cognition, 6:2 (1998) In this example, the gesture provides information not given in speech, namely that the way in which Sylvester gets the monkey to come to him is either by beckoning the monkey to walk around the corner ( In the first pilot study that we carried out <ref> (described in McNeill, 1992) </ref>, we videotaped one single version of a similar script, containing 20 gestures mismatched to speech, and showed it to four subjects. <p> The comment that came closest to being a remark about gestures was one subjects report that the narrator was very animated Co di n g Two coders independently transcribed speech and gesture for each subject's narration of the stimulus video <ref> (using the transcription conventions from McNeill, 1992) </ref>. The two coders then compared their transcriptions, and the few disagreements were resolved by discussion. This provided a complete written transcript of each subject's narration. <p> This question may be addressed by looking at whether there was a difference in understanding of the narration between subjects in the two video version conditions, i.e. between subjects who heard the same speech but saw two different gestures. Analyses of pilot data <ref> (McNeill, 1992 and McNeill, Cassell & McCullough, 1994) </ref>, where only one video version was shown, led us to believe that effects of speech mismatched gestures could be traced in subjects subsequent retelling of the story.

Reference-contexts: We know that gestures are still produced in situations where there is no listener, or the listener cannot see the speaker's hands <ref> (Rim, 1982) </ref>, although more gestures may be produced when an addressee is present (Cohen, 1977; Cohen & Harrison, 1973). Thus it appears that gestures must serve some function for the speaker, independent of any communicative intent.

Surprisingly, the ongoing discussion of the function of gestures in the context of speaking has to a large extent neglected the question of what listeners get out of gesture.

Reference-contexts: The index finger pointing up may sometimes convey that one is referring to the sky, and sometimes convey that one is describing someone climbing upwards. Therefore, we do not expect gestures to have decontextualized transparent meanings <ref> (cf. Tuite, 1993) </ref>. Their interaction with speech is more like the interaction of a schematic diagram (arrows and boxes, for example) with the instructional text it accompanies in the automatic generation of multimedia text, than like the interaction of one word with another 7 .
