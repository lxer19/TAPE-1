Abstract: Conventional resource management systems use a system model to describe resources and a centralized sched-uler to control their allocation. We argue that this paradigm does not adapt well to distributed systems, particularly those built to support high-throughput computing. Obstacles include heterogeneity of resources, which make uniform allocation algorithms difficult to formulate, and distributed ownership, leading to widely varying allocation policies. Faced with these problems, we developed and implemented the classified advertisement (classad) matchmak-ing framework, a flexible and general approach to resource management in distributed environment with decentralized ownership of resources. Novel aspects of the framework include a semi-structured data model that combines schema, data, and query in a simple but powerful specification language, and a clean separation of the matching and claiming phases of resource allocation. The representation and protocols result in a robust, scalable and flexible framework that can evolve with changing resources.

Reference-contexts: The task of mapping specifications to actual resources is performed by a resource co-allocator, which is responsible for coordinating the allocation and management of resources at multiple sites. The RSL allows customers to provide very sophisticated resource requirements, but no analogous mechanism for resources exists. Legion <ref> [5] </ref> takes an object-oriented approach to resource management, formulating the matching problem as an object placement problem [7]. The identification of a candidate resource is performed by an object mapper, whose recommendation is then implemented by a different object.
