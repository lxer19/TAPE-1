Title: Analyzing External Conditions to Improve the Efficiency of HTN Planning

Abstract: One difficulty with existing theoretical work on HTN planning is that it does not address some of the planning constructs that are commonly used in HTN planners for practical applications. Although such constructs can make it difficult to ensure the soundness and completeness of HTN planning, they are important because they can greatly improve the efficiency of planning in practice. In this paper, we describe a way to achieve some of the advantages of such constructs while preserving soundness and completeness, through the use of what we will call external conditions. We describe how to detect some kinds of external conditions automatically by preprocessing the planners knowledge base, and how to use this knowledge to improve the efficiency of the planners refinement strategy. We present experimental results showing that by making use of external conditions as described here, an HTN planner can be significantly more efficient and scale better to large problems.

Reference-contexts: We need to study commitment strategies as a whole to improve such situations. in the future Experiments with the Translog Domain We now describe our experiments with FAF and ExCon in the Translog domain <ref> (Andrews, et al. 1995) </ref>. Translog is a transportation logistics domain specifying various delivery methods for various types of packages. For example, it specifies granular packages such as grain must be delivered by hopper trucks.

Reference-contexts: Also, even when there is a high-level effect to establish a condition, there may be a threat to that establishment that can only be found by looking at primitive tasks. This problem can be overcome, but only by imposing restrictions on how high-level effects are used <ref> (Bacchus and Yang 1991, Young et al. 1994) </ref>. Despite these problems, the ability to recognize important effects early is critical to the good performance of a planner. By examining those actions most likely to effect others, pruning of the search space can occur and much backtracking can be avoided.

Reference-contexts: The code for the UMCP domain-independent planner (which we used for the experiments reported in this paper) is available at &lt;http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/plus/umcp&gt;. Unfortunately, the above work did not incorporate several of the planning constructs used in previous HTN planning systems, such as unsupervised conditions and high-level effects <ref> (Tate 1977) </ref>. Such constructs are often used in practical applications of HTN planning because they can be very useful for improving the efficiency of planningbut the UMCP planner does not incorporate them because they can make it difficult to guarantee the planners soundness and completeness. <p> In this case, we say that the condition C is external to the method M. External conditions do not really have a good analog in STRIPS-style planning, but they are somewhat analogous to the unsupervised conditions used in the Nonlin planner <ref> (Tate 1977) </ref> and external-condition goals used in the SIPE-2 planner (Wilkins 1990). <p> We describe the most important ones here, using the notation that is used for them in the UMCP HTN planner. A predicate task, which is sometimes called a GOAL node <ref> (Tate 1977) </ref> or an achievement task, is analogous to a precondition in a STRIPS-style planning operator: it is a condition that must be true at the time that the method M begins executing.

Reference-contexts: In recent experimental studies comparing various versions of FAF with other well known plan refinement strategies (Joslin and Pollack 1994; Tsuneto et al. 1996), FAF outperformed the other refinement strategies on many planning problems and planning domains. Furthermore, theoretical analyses of FAF <ref> (Tsuneto et al. 1997) </ref> have shown that FAF can produce exponential savings in the size of the planners search space. Since FAF is a general search heuristic,. however, it does not always do as well as other strategies that use domainspecific planning knowledge.

Reference-contexts: External conditions do not really have a good analog in STRIPS-style planning, but they are somewhat analogous to the unsupervised conditions used in the Nonlin planner (Tate 1977) and external-condition goals used in the SIPE-2 planner <ref> (Wilkins 1990) </ref>. The main difference is that instead of being specified explicitly as unsupervised conditions or external-condition goals are, external conditions occur as a result of the structure of the planners knowledge base, and can be detected by examining the knowledge base.
