Title: A Quantitative Approach to Development and Validation of Synthetic Benchmarks for Behavioral Synthesis  
Abstract: We develop a quantitative approach to development and validation of synthetic benchmarks for behavioral synthesis systems. The approach presented in this paper is built on the idea of quantitative benchmark selection. We briefly explain the idea and present experimental results on the quantitative selection and validation of benchmarks. We lay out theoretically and statistically sound foundations to address the key issues related to the synthesis and analysis of synthetic benchmarks for behavioral synthesis systems. The key component of the new approach is the synthetic design example generator which composes the behavioral level specification of a design in such a way that a sunthesized design possesses the properties specified by a given set of numerical parameters. Experimental generation and application of synthetic design examples demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the developed algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The example was first used by Dewilde [4], and in 1988 the IMEC group presented the full implementation of this example according to CCITT standards <ref> [3] </ref>. However, even a brief analysis of the 5th order elliptical WDF reveals many peculiar properties for a benchmark. <p> Since wave digital filters are widely recognized as exceptionally numerically stable, it is exceptionally sensitive on the application of computational transformations. It was also noted that the structure is unnecessarily complex for the required transfer function <ref> [3] </ref>. In the outset, some authors used functionally incorrect implementations. The instances of the 5th order elliptical WDF where some operations were simply deleted have been published.

Reference-contexts: The benchmark set is validated using the resubstitution technique <ref> [5] </ref>. A number of randomly chosen design examples are eliminated from the pool of design examples from which the original benchmark set is selected. And then a new benchmark set is selected. <p> This indicates the method presented in this paper is highly effective <ref> [5] </ref>. 8.2 Synthetic Benchmark Generation Instead of using the characteristics of selected benchmarks, we compute synthetic benchmark parameters from the selected benchmarks. Table 5 shows a comparison between selected benchmarks and synthetic benchmarks in terms of the total distance between a benchmark set and the rest of the design collection.

Reference-contexts: The task is to select k examples which according to some quantitative criteria are the best representatives of all examples. We now define the problem using more formal Garey-Johnson format <ref> [6] </ref>. Quantitative benchmark selection problem Instance: A sufficiently large set X of N examples and a constant M are given. Each example x j is numerically characterized by a set of m relevant properties, x jl , l = 1; :::; m.

It is worth mentioning the benchmarking of random number generators, where an sophisticated and theoretically sound test system is developed [11].

We apply the simulated annealing <ref> [10] </ref> to the randomly constructed SCDFG to obtain an SCDFG with the given properties. The initial state of the optimization system is defined by initial temperature and initial random solution.

More recently, and in particular during the last several years, benchmarking was promoted in computer architecture as the key method for research and product evaluation.

Reference-contexts: And then a new benchmark set is selected. By comparing the new benchmark set with the original by the weighted bipartite matching technique, we can statistically validate the selected benchmark set. We use the Hungarian Method <ref> [12] </ref> for the matching problem. 5.2 Designs Used for Design Space Characteriza tion In order to properly characterize the typical media design examples, we assembled 150 DSP, video, image, graphics, telecommunication, and information theory application examples. <p> At each trial, we observe the number of benchmarks that are replaced by new ones and the difference between two sets of benchmarks. For the computation of the difference between two sets of benchmarks, we use the Hungarian Method <ref> [12] </ref>. We run this sequence of tests 10 times for a given design withdrawal ratio (e.g., 25, 50, etc.) and the results are summarized in Table 4.

Reference-contexts: A synthetic design is an artificially generated instance of a synthesis problem. We impose no restrictions on the computational model to our approach to synthetic benchmark generation. In our experiment, we used the synchronous data flow graph (SDFG) on semi-infinite streams of data <ref> [13] </ref> as the underlying computational model for synthetic benchmarks since we had a large number of design examples based on the model. A design example is represented by a control data flow graph (CDFG) format [14].

In fact, some industrial benchmark suites have greatly helped improve the quality of contemporary digital systems. As computer hardware and software systems become increasingly more complex, testing and simulation tend to replace verification and validation.
