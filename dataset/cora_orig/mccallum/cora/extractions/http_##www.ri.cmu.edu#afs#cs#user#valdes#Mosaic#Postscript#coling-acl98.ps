Title: A Procedure for Multi-Class Discrimination and some Linguistic Applications

Abstract: The paper describes a novel computational tool for multiple concept learning. Unlike previous approaches, whose major goal is prediction on unseen instances rather than the legibility of the output, our MPD (Maximally Parsimonious Discrimination) program emphasizes the conciseness and intelligibility of the resultant class descriptions, using three intuitive simplicity criteria to this end. We illustrate MPD with applications in componential analysis (in lexicol-ogy and phonology), language typology, and speech pathology.

Reference-contexts: The second accords with the also familiar thesis that conjunctive descriptions are more comprehensible (they are the norm for typological classification (Hempel, 1965), and they are more readily acquired by experimental subjects than disjunctive ones <ref> (Bruner et. al., 1956) </ref>), and the third expresses the usefulness, for a diversity of reasons, of having all alternatives.

Reference-contexts: The first goal stems from the familiar requirement that classes be distinguished by jointly necessary and sufficient descriptions. The second accords with the also familiar thesis that conjunctive descriptions are more comprehensible (they are the norm for typological classification <ref> (Hempel, 1965) </ref>, and they are more readily acquired by experimental subjects than disjunctive ones (Bruner et. al., 1956)), and the third expresses the usefulness, for a diversity of reasons, of having all alternatives.

Reference-contexts: remain in-discriminable, which is no surprise given their areal and genetic affinity. 5 Speech production in aphasics This application concerns the discrimination of different forms of aphasia on the basis of their language behaviour. 8 We addressed the profiling of aphasic patients, using the CAP dataset from the CHILDES database <ref> (MacWhinney, 1995) </ref>, containing (among others) 22 English subjects; 5 are control and the others suffer from anomia (3 patients), Broca's disorder (6), Wer-nicke's disorder (5), and nonfluents (3). The patients are grouped into classes according to their fit to a prototype used by neurologists and speech pathologists.

Reference-contexts: Ideally, good profiles, besides making good predictions on future instances, should be concise, intelligible, and comprehensive (i.e. yielding all alternatives). Previous approaches like ID3 (Quinlan, 1983) or C4.5 <ref> (Quinlan, 1993) </ref>, which use variations on greedy search, i.e. localized best-next-step search (typically based on information-gain heuristics), have as their major goal prediction on unseen instances, and therefore do not have as an explicit concern the conciseness, intelligibility, and comprehensiveness of the output.

Reference-contexts: The derived features mechanism can be essential in achieving intuitive contrasts, as in verbal case frame learning, where the interaction between features nicely fits the task of learning "slot dependencies" <ref> (Li and Abe, 1996) </ref>. (3) All alternative profiles of equal simplicity are not always a necessity as in tasks of type (i)-(ii), but are most essential in many tasks where there are different costs of finding the feature values of unseen instances (e.g., computing a syntactic feature, generally, would be much
