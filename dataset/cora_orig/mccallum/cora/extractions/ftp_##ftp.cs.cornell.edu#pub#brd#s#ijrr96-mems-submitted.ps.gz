Abstract: Programmable vector fields can be used to control a variety of flexible planar parts feeders. These devices can exploit exotic actuation technologies such as arrayed, massively-parallel micro-fabricated motion pixels or transversely vibrating (macroscopic) plates. These new automation designs promise great flexibility, speed, and dexterity|we believe they may be employed to orient, singulate, sort, feed, and assemble parts. However, since they have only recently been invented, programming and controlling them for manipulation tasks is challenging. When a part is placed on our devices, the programmed vector field induces a force and moment upon it. Over time, the part may come to rest in a dynamic equilibrium state. By chaining together sequences of vector fields, the equilibrium states of a part in the field may be cascaded to obtain a desired final state. The resulting strategies require no sensing and enjoy efficient planning algorithms. This paper begins by describing our experimental devices. In particular, we describe our progress in building the M-Chip (Manipulation Chip), a massively parallel array of programmable micro-motion pixels. As proof of concept, we demonstrate a prototype M-Chip containing over 11,000 silicon actuators in one square inch. Both the M-Chip, as well as macroscopic devices such as transversely vibrating plates, may be programmed with vector fields, and their behavior predicted and controlled using our equilibrium analysis. We demonstrate lower bounds (i.e., impossibility results) on what the devices cannot do, and results on a classification of control strategies yielding design criteria by which well-behaved manipulation strategies may be developed. We provide sufficient conditions for programmable fields to induce well-behaved equilibria on every part placed on our devices. We define composition operators to build complex strategies from simple ones, and show the resulting fields are also well-behaved. We discuss whether fields outside this class can be useful and free of pathology. Using these tools, we describe new manipulation algorithms. In particular, we improve existing planning algorithms by a quadratic factor, and the plan-length by a linear factor. Using our new and improved strategies, we show how to simultaneously orient and pose any part, without sensing, from an arbitrary initial configuration. We relax earlier dynamic and mechanical assumptions to obtain more robust and flexible strategies. Finally, we consider parts feeders that can only implement a very limited "vocabulary" of vector fields (as opposed to the pixel-wise programmability assumed above). We show how to plan and execute parts-posing and orienting strategies for these devices, but with a significant increase in planning complexity and some sacrifice in completeness guarantees. We discuss the tradeoff between mechanical complexity and planning complexity. fl An earlier, much shorter version of this paper was presented at the Workshop on Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (Toulouse, France, July 1996).

These devices often exploit exotic actuation technologies such as arrayed, microfabricated motion pixels <ref> [9, 8, 7] </ref> or transversely vibrating plates [4]. These new automation designs promise great flexibility, speed, and dexterity|we believe they may be employed to orient, singulate, sort, feed, and assemble parts (see for example Figures 1 and 7). <p> Moreover, such fields can be composed using addition, sequential composition, "parallel" composition by superposition of controls, or by a new kind of "morphing" of control signals which we will define. Previous results on array manipulation strategies may be formalized using equilibrium analysis. In <ref> [8] </ref> we proposed a family of control strategies called squeeze patterns and a planning algorithm for parts-orientation. This first result proved an O (n 2 ) upper bound on the number E of orientation equilibria of a non-pathological (see Section 3.2) planar part with n vertices. <p> The planning complexity drops to O (E 2 ) = O (n 2 ). 3. Throughout the strategy execution, every part rotates about one fixed, unique point (after the first step). 4. This means that we can dispense with one critical assumption (called 2Phase in <ref> [8] </ref>): We no longer need assume that the transitional and rotational motions induced by the array interact in a "quasi-static" and "sequential" manner. We motivate our results by beginning with a description of the experimental devices we are inter ested in programming. <p> Under our grammar, the resulting strategies are guaranteed to be well-behaved. Finally, both our radial strategies and our finite manipulation grammar have the following advantage over previous manipulation algorithms for programmable vector fields: previous algorithms such as <ref> [8] </ref> guarantee to uniquely orient a part, but the transitional position of the part is unknown at the strategy's termination. Both of our new algorithms guarantee to position the part uniquely (up to part symmetry) in translation as well as orientation space. <p> MEMS manipulator arrays have been proposed by several MEMS researchers, among others Fujita et al. [26], Storment et al. [60], Will et al. [38], Jacobson et al. [34], or Suh et al. [61]. For an overview see [38] or <ref> [9, 8] </ref>. Our arrays (Figure 2) are fabricated using a Scream (Single-Crystal Reactive Etching and Metallization) process developed in the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility [63, 58]. The Scream process is low-temperature, and does not interfere with traditional VLSI [57]. <p> The combination and selective activation of several actuators with different motion bias allows us to generate various motions in discrete directions, spanning the plane (Figure 5).

[4] have presented a device that uses the force field created by transverse vibrations of a plate to position and align parts. <p> Particularly important is determining the stable equilibrium poses a part can reach in which all forces and moments are balanced. This equilibrium analysis was introduced in our short conference paper <ref> [8] </ref>, where we presented a theory of manipulation for programmable vector fields, and an algorithm that generates manipulation strategies to orient polygonal parts without sensor feedback using a sequence of squeeze fields.

Definition 1 [8] Assume l is a straight line through the origin. A squeeze field f is a two-dimensional force field defined as follows: 1. If z 2 R 2 lies on l then f (z) = 0. 2. <p> In general, this progression corresponds to a rotation and a translation of l. In the following proof for Proposition 4, we investigate the relationship between the location of the bisector, and the corresponding left and right areas of P and its respective centers of mass. 2 In particular, in <ref> [8] </ref> we assumed that k = O (1). 11 s r 0 r 2 a 1 r r 0 1 This will allow us to show that for combinatorially equivalent bisector placements there are only a finite number of possible equilibria, and that this number is bounded by O (k). <p> There are at most O (k) solutions to these two equations. 2 15 3.3 Planning of Manipulation Strategies In this section we present an algorithm for sensorless parts alignment with squeeze fields <ref> [8] </ref>. Recall from Section 3.2 that in squeeze fields, the equilibria for connected polygons are discrete (except for a neutrally stable translation parallel to the squeeze line which we will disregard for the remainder of Section 3). To model our actuator arrays and vibratory devices, in [8] we made the following <p> alignment with squeeze fields <ref> [8] </ref>. Recall from Section 3.2 that in squeeze fields, the equilibria for connected polygons are discrete (except for a neutrally stable translation parallel to the squeeze line which we will disregard for the remainder of Section 3). To model our actuator arrays and vibratory devices, in [8] we made the following assumptions: Density: The generated forces can be described by a vector field, i.e. the individual microactuators are dense compared to the size of the moving part. 2Phase: The motion of a part has two phases: (1) Pure translation towards l until the part is in translational <p> If a part moves while in translational equilibrium, in general the motion is not a pure rotation, but also has a translational component. Therefore, relaxing assumption 2Phase is one of the key results of this paper. Definition 6 <ref> [8] </ref> Let be the orientation of a connected polygon P in a squeeze field, and let us assume that condition I holds. <p> This definition immediately implies the following lemma: Lemma 7 <ref> [8] </ref> Let P be a polygon with orientation in a squeeze field such that condition I holds. P is stable if t () = 0, t (+) 0, and t () 0. Otherwise P is unstable. <p> ffi) 0. 2 Using this lemma we can identify all stable orientations, which allows us to construct the squeeze function [29] of P (see Figure 11c), i.e. the mapping from an initial orientation of P to the stable equilibrium orientation that it will reach in the squeeze field: Lemma 8 <ref> [8] </ref> Let P be a polygonal part on an actuator array A such that assumptions Density and 2Phase hold. Given the turn function t of P , its corresponding squeeze function s : S 1 ! S 1 is constructed as follows: 1. <p> positive moment (t &gt; 0) causes counterclockwise motion, and a negative moment (t &lt; 0) causes clockwise motion until the next root of t is reached. 2 We conclude that any connected polygonal part, when put in a squeeze field, reaches one of a finite number of possible orientation equilibria <ref> [8] </ref>. The motion of the part and, in particular, the mapping between initial orientation and equilibrium orientation is described by the squeeze function, which is derived from the turn function as described in Lemma 8. Note that all squeeze functions derived from turn functions are monotone step-shaped functions. <p> Stable and unstable equilibria are reversed. This shows that our mechanical analysis of equilibrium is different from that of the parallel-jaw gripper. Let us summarize these results: 17 gripper and (b) a MEMS squeeze field. In this example, stable and unstable equilibria are reversed. Theorem 9 <ref> [8] </ref> Let P be a polygon whose interior is connected. There exists an alignment strategy consisting of a sequence of squeeze fields that uniquely orients P up to symmetries. <p> The existing prototype devices exhibit only a limited range of programmability. For example, the prototype MEMS arrays described in Section 2.1 <ref> [9, 8, 7] </ref> currently have actuators in only four different directions, and the actuators are only row-wise controllable.

Reference-contexts: A parts feeder is a machine that orients such parts before they are fed to an assembly station. Currently, the design of parts feeders is a black art that is responsible for up to 30% of the cost and 50% of workcell failures <ref> [47, 10, 25, 56, 59] </ref>. Thus although part feeding accounts for a large portion of assembly cost, there is not much scientific basis for automating the process. <p> As they climb, a sequence of ba*es and cutouts in the track create a mechanical "filter" that causes parts in all but one orientation to fall back into the bowl for another attempt at running the gauntlet <ref> [10, 51, 55] </ref>. Sony's APOS parts feeder [32] uses an array of nests (silhouette traps) cut into a vibrating plate. The nests and the vibratory motion are designed so that the part will remain in the nest only in a particular orientation.

Reference-contexts: Non-potential fields can be used safely with the following methodology: Let H C = R 2 fi S 1 be the undesirable limit set. For example, H could be a limit cycle where the part spins forever. Let b P V (H) be the weak pre-image <ref> [40, 16] </ref> of H under the field V . If we can ensure that the part starts in a configuration z 62 b P V (H), it will not reach the unwanted limit cycle. <p> The issue is that if, for many poses, jM ()j is very small, then the orientation process will be slow. Better measures are also desirable. Uncertainty. In practice, neither the force vector field nor the part geometry will be exact, and both can only be characterized up to tolerances <ref> [16] </ref>. This is particularly important at micro scale. Within the framework of potential fields, we can express this uncertainty by considering not one single potential function U P , but rather families of potentials that correspond to different values within the uncertainty range. <p> Then we wish to calculate a sequence of fields F 1 ; F 2 ; ; F k such that B F 1 (B F 2 ( B F k (G) )) = C, where G is a single point in C (cf. <ref> [40, 22, 13, 16, 11] </ref>). Output Sensitivity. We have seen in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 that the efficiency of planning and executing manipulation strategies critically depends on the number of equilibrium configurations.

Reference-contexts: However, for arbitrary fields (e.g. the force fields described in Section 2.2 which are induced by vibrating plates) such algorithms may not exist. Instead we can employ approximate methods to predict the behavior of the part in the force field (for more details also see <ref> [19] </ref>). These methods are typically numerical computations that involve simulating the part from a specific initial pose, until it reaches equilibrium. 4 We call the cost for such a computation the simulation complexity s (n).

Reference-contexts: This model is frequently used in mechanics (see e.g. <ref> [20] </ref>). Point contact permits rapid, discontinuous changes in force and moment.

Reference-contexts: Although the vibratory motion is under software control, specialized mechanical nests must be designed for each part [46]. The reason for the success of vibratory bowl feeders and the Sony APOS system is the underlying principle of sensorless manipulation <ref> [22] </ref> that allows parts positioning and orienting without sensor feedback. This principle is even more important at small scales, because sensor data will be less accurate and more difficult to obtain. <p> Minimalism is interesting because doing task A without resource B proves that B is somehow inessential to the information structure of the task. In robotics, minimalism has become increasingly influential. Raibert [49] showed that walking and running machines could be built without static stability. Erdmann and Mason <ref> [22] </ref> showed how to do dexterous manipulation without sensing. McGeer [44] built a biped, kneed walker without sensors, computers, or actuators. <p> This will significantly reduce the complexity of a task-level motion planner. Hence if assumption 2Phase is relaxed, this idea still enables us to simplify the general motion planning problem (as formulated e.g. by Lozano-Perez, Mason, and Taylor in [40]) to that of Erdmann and Mason <ref> [22] </ref>. Conversely, relaxing assumption 2Phase raises the complexity from the "linear" planning scheme of Goldberg [29] to the forward-chaining searches of Erdmann and Mason [22], or Donald [17]. 4 Lower Bounds: What Programmable Vector Fields Cannot Do We now present "lower bounds" | constituting vector fields and parts with pathological behavior, <p> still enables us to simplify the general motion planning problem (as formulated e.g. by Lozano-Perez, Mason, and Taylor in [40]) to that of Erdmann and Mason <ref> [22] </ref>.

The total running time of this algorithm is O (m 2 E (s (n) + 2 E )). 2 Hence, as in <ref> [22] </ref>, for any part we can decide whether a part can be uniquely posed using the vocabulary of field operators fF i g but (a) the planning time is exponential and (b) we do not know how to characterize the class of parts that can be oriented by fF i g. <p> Then we wish to calculate a sequence of fields F 1 ; F 2 ; ; F k such that B F 1 (B F 2 ( B F k (G) )) = C, where G is a single point in C (cf. <ref> [40, 22, 13, 16, 11] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: A parts feeder is a machine that orients such parts before they are fed to an assembly station.

Reference-contexts: For example, it allows us to show that orientation equilibrium in a simple squeeze field is equivalent to the stability of a homogeneous boat floating in water, provided its density is = 1 2 water (for references on boat stability see e.g. <ref> [28, pp. 42ff] </ref> or [48, pp. 290ff]). 5.1 Properties of Lifted Force and Potential Fields In this section we show that for a polygonal part P , the lifted force field is always continuous, and the lifted potential is always smooth.

Reference-contexts: This is true if and only if t ( + ffi) 0 and t ( ffi) 0. 2 Using this lemma we can identify all stable orientations, which allows us to construct the squeeze function <ref> [29] </ref> of P (see Figure 11c), i.e. the mapping from an initial orientation of P to the stable equilibrium orientation that it will reach in the squeeze field: Lemma 8 [8] Let P be a polygonal part on an actuator array A such that assumptions Density and 2Phase hold. <p> The motion of the part and, in particular, the mapping between initial orientation and equilibrium orientation is described by the squeeze function, which is derived from the turn function as described in Lemma 8. Note that all squeeze functions derived from turn functions are monotone step-shaped functions. Goldberg <ref> [29] </ref> has given an algorithm that automatically synthesizes a manipulation strategy to uniquely orient a part, given its squeeze function. While Goldberg's algorithm was designed for squeezes with a robotic parallel-jaw gripper, in fact, it is more general, and can be used for arbitrary monotone step-shaped squeeze functions. <p> This means that the image of its corresponding squeeze function is a set of E discrete values. Given such a squeeze function, Goldberg's algorithm <ref> [29] </ref> constructs alignment strategies with O (E) steps. Planning complexity is O (E 2 ). 2 Goldberg's strategies [29] have the same complexity bounds for convex and non-convex parts, because when using squeeze grasps with a parallel-jaw gripper, only the convex hull of the part need be considered. <p> This means that the image of its corresponding squeeze function is a set of E discrete values. Given such a squeeze function, Goldberg's algorithm <ref> [29] </ref> constructs alignment strategies with O (E) steps. Planning complexity is O (E 2 ). 2 Goldberg's strategies [29] have the same complexity bounds for convex and non-convex parts, because when using squeeze grasps with a parallel-jaw gripper, only the convex hull of the part need be considered. This is not the case for programmable vector fields, where manipulation strategies for non-convex parts are more expensive. <p> Hence if assumption 2Phase is relaxed, this idea still enables us to simplify the general motion planning problem (as formulated e.g. by Lozano-Perez, Mason, and Taylor in [40]) to that of Erdmann and Mason [22].

E.g. a single-chip air-bag sensor is commercially available [3]; video projections using an integrated, monolithic mirror array have been demonstrated recently [54]. <p> Various microsensors and microactuators have been shown to perform successfully.

Reference-contexts: In robotics, minimalism has become increasingly influential. Raibert [49] showed that walking and running machines could be built without static stability. Erdmann and Mason [22] showed how to do dexterous manipulation without sensing. McGeer <ref> [44] </ref> built a biped, kneed walker without sensors, computers, or actuators. Canny and Goldberg [14] argue that minimalism has a long tradition in industrial manufacturing, and developed geometric algorithms for orienting parts using simple grippers and accurate, low cost light beams.

Reference-contexts: The Scream process is low-temperature, and does not interfere with traditional VLSI [57]. Hence it opens the door to building monolithic microelectromechanical systems with integrated microactuators and control circuitry on the same wafer. Our design is based on microfabricated torsional resonators <ref> [45] </ref>. Each unit device consists of a rectangular grid etched out of single-crystal silicon suspended by two rods that act as torsional springs (Figure 3). The grid is about 200 m long and extends 120 m on each side of the rod. The rods are 150 m long.

Reference-contexts: By tilting the plate and letting parts flow across it, the nests eventually fill up with parts in the desired orientation. Although the vibratory motion is under software control, specialized mechanical nests must be designed for each part <ref> [46] </ref>. The reason for the success of vibratory bowl feeders and the Sony APOS system is the underlying principle of sensorless manipulation [22] that allows parts positioning and orienting without sensor feedback.

Reference-contexts: A parts feeder is a machine that orients such parts before they are fed to an assembly station. Currently, the design of parts feeders is a black art that is responsible for up to 30% of the cost and 50% of workcell failures <ref> [47, 10, 25, 56, 59] </ref>. Thus although part feeding accounts for a large portion of assembly cost, there is not much scientific basis for automating the process.

Reference-contexts: For example, it allows us to show that orientation equilibrium in a simple squeeze field is equivalent to the stability of a homogeneous boat floating in water, provided its density is = 1 2 water (for references on boat stability see e.g. [28, pp. 42ff] or <ref> [48, pp. 290ff] </ref>). 5.1 Properties of Lifted Force and Potential Fields In this section we show that for a polygonal part P , the lifted force field is always continuous, and the lifted potential is always smooth.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, there is also good news. We present conditions for fields to induce well-behaved equilibria when lifted, by exploiting the theory of potential fields. While potential fields have been widely used in robot control <ref> [36, 37, 52, 50] </ref>, micro-actuator arrays present us with the ability to explicitly program the applied force at every point in a vector field. Whereas previous work has developed control strategies with artificial potential fields, our fields are non-artificial (i.e., physical).

Sony's APOS parts feeder [32] uses an array of nests (silhouette traps) cut into a vibrating plate.

Reference-contexts: It may be possible to generate 3D force fields by using Lorentz electromagnetic forces.

The tuning (control) of the electric coils could be effected as follows: Integrated control circuitry could be fabricated and co-located with the coils, and conceivably a power supply.

Arrays with individually addressable actuators at various orientations are possible (see <ref> [9, 8, 38, 7, 61] </ref>) but require significant development effort. There are also limitations on the resolution of the devices given by fabrication constraints. For the vibrating plate device from Section 2.2 the fields are even more constrained by the vibrational modes of the plate.
