Abstract: The IEEE 802.14 working group is currently standardizing a new media access control (MAC) protocol for the emerging Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC) networks. Crucial for the success of 802.14 will be its ability to support higher layer traffic services, namely, ATM Constant Bit Rate (CBR), Variable Bit Rate (VBR) and Available Bit Rate (ABR) traffic classes. In this study, we investigate the interoperation of the MAC protocol, defined by 802.14, with ABR transmissions. An important finding of our study is that the bandwidth contention on the upstream channel in the HFC network may interfere with the feedback congestion control mechanisms of ABR traffic control. This interference can result in unfairness between ABR sources, and decreased utilization of the upstream HFC channel. As a solution to the problem we propose a scheme whereby the headend station of the HFC network returns congestion information contained in resource management (RM) cells to the ABR sources. The proposed mechanism can be incorporated into the ABR rate control scheme without modifying the current traffic management specifications. Numerous simulation scenarios are presented to illustrate our findings. Parts of the results have been presented to the IEEE 802.14 standardization committee.

Reference-contexts: We will show how the proposed solution can be incorporated into the IEEE 802.14 [9] and the ATM Traffic Management <ref> [1] </ref> specifications, with no modifications to those standards. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide an overview of the MAC protocol proposed by the IEEE 802.14 working group. In Section 3 we briefly review the ABR flow control mechanism. <p> The collision resolution scheme used in this paper is based on the status of January 1997 as reflected by [9, 11]. 3 ABR Service Overview The Available Bit Rate (ABR) service in ATM networks <ref> [1] </ref> is intended to carry data traffic, which requires a high degree of data integrity and incurs some transfer delays. <p> If a returning 5 RM cell indicates congestion in the network, the source decreases its Allowed Cell Rate (ACR) multiplicatively by the Rate Decrease Factor (RDF). Otherwise, the source increases its ACR additively by a Rate Increase Factor (RIF). In <ref> [1] </ref>, two modes of switch behavior can be offered: EFCI (Explicit Forward Congestion Indication) and ER (Explicit Rate). When in a congested state, a switch in EFCI mode (EFCI switch) sets the EFCI bit in the header of all data cells that are forwarded to its destination. <p> As far as ABR QOS is concerned, the ABR service category definition in <ref> [1] </ref> clearly states that no bound is required on the delay or the delay variation experienced by a given connection. There is, however, a requirement to provide a low cell loss ratio for those connections whose end-stations obey a specified reference behavior. <p> In this section we present a scheme that maintains fairness and prevents a collapse of EFCI switch-control. Our solution has a number of desirable properties: * Our scheme is implementable within the framework of the ATM Forum Traffic Management 4.0 specification <ref> [1] </ref>. No modifications to the ATM standard are required. * The interactions between the MAC and the ATM layers is kept minimal. * Our scheme does not result in throughput reductions or delay increases for non-ABR traffic. <p> The solution works within the framework of the ATM Traffic Management 4.0 specification. More precisely, we exploit that <ref> [1] </ref> makes allowances for extra ABR flow control mechanisms, such as the creation of backward RM cells at the switch. 11 5.1 Solution Approach Our scheme to prevent a collapse of EFCI rate control during congestion periods in the HFC network is based on short-circuiting the feedback loop of RM cells <p> This backward RM cell shortens the feedback loop for sources sending to HFC destinations, since it short-circuits the delay that will be incurred on the congested upstream link. The generation of additional backward RM cells works within the framework of the TM 4.0 specification (Section 5.10.6 in <ref> [1] </ref>); the TM specifications permits ATM switches to generate backward RM cells at a limited rate of 10 cells/sec per connection with either the congestion indication (CI) or no increase (NI) bit set. Next we we demonstrate the impact of our solution method for the Downstream Configuration.

Reference-contexts: In November 1996, the 802.14 working group agreed upon a collision resolution scheme for the MAC. The protocol is based on a blocking ternary tree splitting algorithm [3]. Tree splitting algorithms have been used in the past to improve the performance of collision access <ref> [2] </ref>. In a tree splitting algorithm, all stations that are involved in a collision split into a number of subgroups. After a collision, only the stations in the first subgroup continue the collision resolution step. <p> A ternary tree splitting algorithm always divides colliding stations into three subgroups. Some tree-splitting algorithms are non-blocking, which allows stations to transmit 4 new requests at any time. Blocking tree-splitting algorithms do not allow new stations to transmit during an ongoing collision resolution process <ref> [2] </ref>. The selection of a blocking algorithm for 802.14 is intended to reduce the MAC access delay variance [5]. The current version of the MAC protocol is heavily influenced by an adaption of the tree splitting algorithm, the n-ary Stack Random Access Algorithm [10, 3, 4].

Reference-contexts: Due the use of different parameters for the calculation of the explicit rate, there are several variations for ER switch mechanisms. In this paper we use an ER mechanism developed at NIST <ref> [8] </ref>; this mechanism attempts to achieve maximum network stability in terms of ACR and buffer occupancy oscillations. 4 Effectiveness of ABR Flow Control Traffic over HFC The key issue for transmitting ABR traffic over an HFC network is whether the QOS guarantees of ABR connections can be maintained.
