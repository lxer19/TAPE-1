Abstract: We consider the problem of projecting a point in a polyhedral set onto the boundary of the set using an arbitrary norm for the projection. Two types of polyhedral sets, one defined by a convex combination of k points in R n and the second by the intersection of m closed halfspaces in R n , lead to disparate optimization problems for finding such a projection. The first case leads to a mathematical program with a linear objective function and constraints that are linear inequalities except for a single nonconvex cylindrical constraint. Interestingly, for the 1-norm, this nonconvex problem can be solved by solving 2n linear programs. The second polyhedral set leads to a much simpler problem of determining the minimum of m easily evaluated numbers. These disparate mathematical complexities parallel known ones for the related problem of finding the largest ball, with radius measured by an arbitrary norm, that can be inscribed in the polyhedral set. For a polyhedral set of the first type this problem is NP-hard for the 2-norm and the 1-norm [4] and solvable by a single linear program for the 1-norm [7], while for the second type this problem leads to a single linear program even for a general norm [6]. 1. Introduction. We consider a polytope in the n-dimensional real space R n

Reference-contexts: n , that can be inscribed in S is given by: = ks p (s)k = max min fs T y + jB T y + e 0; kyk 0 = 1g:(2.7) Proof The distance function ks p (s)k of (2.2) is an upper semicontinuous function of s on S <ref> [1, p 115, Theorem 1] </ref>. Since S is compact it follows that the upper semicontinuous distance function ks p (s)k on S attains its maximum on S. Problem (2.7) is a difficult problem to solve for a general norm.

Reference-contexts: Given a point s 2 S we want to find a projection p onto the boundary bd (S) of S using an arbitrary norm on R n . 1 Similar problems arise in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) <ref> [2] </ref> where the distance to the boundary is an efficiency measure of a Decision Making Unit (DMU) represented by that point. Each DMU is represented by an n-dimensional column of B and each of the n dimensions measures components required or products generated by that DMU.

Reference-contexts: Going backward from (1.2) to (1.1) is also difficult, for example 1-norm unit ball has 2n faces but 2 n vertices, and may not even be possible because T may be unbounded. In fact by Motzkin's Polyhedral Decomposition Theorem <ref> [5, Theorem 1] </ref> the polyhedral set T is equivalent to the algebraic sum of a convex combination of points in R n (a set similar to S) plus a convex polyhedral cone, neither of which are easy to find. 1.1.

Reference-contexts: Projecting a DMU onto the boundary of S gives an indication of how close to an efficient point that DMU is. We will show in Section 2, by using an arbitrary-norm projection onto a hyperplane <ref> [9] </ref>, that this basically is a nonconvex problem, which however can be reduced (Theorem 2.2) to a mathematical program with a linear objective function and linear constraints except for a single nonlinear equality constraint that restricts a solution to be on the surface of a cylinder determined by the dual norm <p> Gritzmann and Klee [6, Proof of (1.14)] give the distance between a point and its projection on the hyperplane, but do not give a projection explicitly.
