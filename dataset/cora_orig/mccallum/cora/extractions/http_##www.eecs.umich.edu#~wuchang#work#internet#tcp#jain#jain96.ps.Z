Abstract: The OSU scheme is a rate-based congestion avoidance scheme for ATM networks using explicit rate indication. This work was one of the first attempts to define explicit rate switch mechanisms and the Resource Management (RM) cell format in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks. The key features of the scheme include explicit rate feedback, congestion avoidance, fair operation while maintaining high utilization, use of input rate as a congestion metric, O(1) complexity. This paper presents an overview of the scheme, presents those features of the scheme that have now become common features of other switch algorithms and discusses three extensions of the scheme.

Reference-contexts: In fact, until July 1994, even ATM networking standards used an explicit binary feedback method called "Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI) 1 [6]. The ATM Forum then decided to include an "explicit rate" approach in which the switches tell the sources the exact rate that they can use <ref> [1] </ref>. In the basic approach decided by the Forum, the sources periodically send resource management (RM) cells that contain, among other things, indication of a source's current load. The RM cells travel through the network to the destination, which then returns them to the source. <p> This paper presents results of our first attempt to design an explicit rate scheme for ATM networks. This work was done between July and October 1994. The scheme is a follow on to the MIT scheme <ref> [1] </ref>, and hence is named the Ohio State University (OSU) scheme. This research has helped us and the Forum understand many issues that were not so well understood before and formulate approaches for tackling these issues. <p> The detailed pseudo code of aggressive fairness option is given in appendix B. 4.2 Precise Fair Share Computation Option Given the actual rates of all active sources, we can exactly calculate the fair share using the MIT algorithm <ref> [1] </ref> (MIT scheme uses desired rates). Thus, instead of using only the number of active VCs, we could use the OCRs of various sources to compute the fair share.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The amount of data that can be lost due to congestion on a link depends upon its delay-bandwidth product. On high-speed networks, this amount can be large and so it is particularly important to have proper congestion control in such networks <ref> [4, 12, 15] </ref>. This is why traffic management is such a hot topic in ATM Forum, International Telecommunications Union (ITU), and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), where high-speed networking standards of tomorrow are being designed.

Reference-contexts: Until about 1994, most of the congestion control work was based on window flow controls (e.g., in TCP/IP). Feedback was either implicit (e.g., via timeouts in TCP/IP <ref> [5] </ref>) or explicit but binary (e.g., in DECbit [8] or its derivatives). In fact, until July 1994, even ATM networking standards used an explicit binary feedback method called "Explicit Forward Congestion Indication (EFCI) 1 [6].

Reference-contexts: The purpose of this paper is to document the issues, present our approaches to resolve these issues, and our results using a few schemes based on these approaches. The OSU scheme was the first of these schemes. An overview of the OSU scheme was published recently in a workshop <ref> [7] </ref>. We first present a summary of the scheme in section 2. In section 3, we present the lessons learnt from this work and the key contributions of this research that either have become commonly accepted parts of switch schemes or have been adopted by the standard.

For rate-based schemes, the system will be in this region when the sum of the rates of all sources is less than 100 % in the steady state. <p> DECbit and many of its derivative schemes achieve congestion avoidance by trying to keep average queue length at one <ref> [8] </ref>. With rate-based control, the network will not be overloaded as long as the link utilization is below 100%. Thus, congestion avoidance can be achieved simply by trying to keep the link utilization at a value close to, but below 100%. <p> The slow start scheme used in TCP/IP is also an example of unipolar scheme with negative polarity although in this case the feedback (packet loss) is an implicit feedback (no bits or control packets are sent to the source). The OSU scheme uses both polarities. The DECbit scheme <ref> [8] </ref> is another example of a bipolar scheme.

Reference-contexts: These are specific to the OSU scheme. The detailed pseudo code of BECN option is given in appendix B. 5 Simulation Results The OSU scheme has been extensively simulated and the results have been presented in ATM Forum Contributions. A complete set of simulations can be found in <ref> [9] </ref>. Here we present one sample result for the basic scheme and its extensions. This configuration consists of four VCs and three switches as shown in Figure 4. The second link is shared by VC3 and VC4.

Reference-contexts: Many features of the scheme are now being commonly used in many switch implementations. A patent on the inventions of this scheme is also pending <ref> [10] </ref>. Three different options that further improve the performance over the basic scheme are also de 18 scribed. These allow the fairness to be achieved quickly, oscillations to be minimized, and feedback delay to be reduced.

Reference-contexts: The standard requires only one rate. The OSU scheme is, therefore, incompatible with the ATM forum's current traffic management. Although, it cannot be used directly, most of its features and results can be ported to design compatible schemes. One such upgrade, called Explicit Rate Indication for Congestion Avoidance (ERICA) <ref> [11] </ref> has since been developed, which is also mentioned in the ATM Traffic Management 4.0 standards. 17 7 Limitations and Summary This paper describes an explicit rate based congestion avoidance scheme for ATM networks. The scheme was developed as the ATM Forum traffic management specifications were being developed.

Reference-contexts: Such schemes send feedback only when the network is underloaded and avoid sending feedback during overload. The PRCA scheme <ref> [13] </ref> is an example of a unipolar scheme with positive polarity only. Unipolar schemes with negative polarity are similarly possible. Early versions of PRCA used negative polarity in the sense that the sources increased the rate continuously unless instructed by the network to decrease.
