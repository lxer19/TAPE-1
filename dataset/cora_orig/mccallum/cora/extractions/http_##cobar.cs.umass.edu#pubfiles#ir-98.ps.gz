Title: Dictionary Methods for Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval

Abstract: Multi-lingual information retrieval (IR) has largely been limited to the development of systems for use with a specific foreign language. The explosion in the availability of electronic media in languages other than English makes the development of IR systems that can cross language boundaries increasingly important. In this paper, we present experiments that analyze the factors that affect dictionary based methods for cross-lingual retrieval and present methods that dramatically reduce the errors such an approach usually makes.

Reference-contexts: Relevance feedback [10] is a method by which a query is modified using information derived from documents whose relevance to the query is known. Typically, terms found in relevant documents are added to the query. Local feedback <ref> [1] </ref> differs from classic relevance feedback in that it assumes the top retrieved documents are relevant. Applying feedback prior to translation (pre-translation) should create a stronger base query for translation by adding terms that emphasize query concepts.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, query sets beginning ES-and SE- refer to sets resulting from modifications made to the ES-BASE and SE-BASE queries, respectively. All work in this study was performed using the INQUERY information retrieval system. INQUERY is based on the Bayesian inference net model and is described elsewhere <ref> [12, 11, 2] </ref>. 3.1 Simple Word-By-Word Translation Our first experiment was designed to test the effects of simple word-by-word translation on retrieval performance and to determine the factors causing them. Base queries were translated word for word via MRD as described above.

Reference-contexts: The trans-formation, by reduction of the document space, generates a translation matrix. Tests of the effectiveness of the method have been limited by its computational complexity. More recently, Davis and Dunning <ref> [3, 4] </ref> have developed several other approaches to query translation for cross-lingual retrieval, all relying on a parallel corpus. In two methods, "translations" are performed by replacing English (Spanish) query terms with high frequency or statistically significant terms from the Spanish (English) side of the parallel corpus.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the computational complexity of LSI brings into question the kind of performance one could expect on a more realistic multilingual collection. The method also relies on the use of parallel corpora. Another method that relies on parallel and aligned corpora has been suggested by Dunning and Davis <ref> [5] </ref>. Their method is based on the vector space model and involves the linear transformation of the representation of a query in one language to its corresponding representation in another language. The trans-formation, by reduction of the document space, generates a translation matrix.

Reference-contexts: The test collection was also very small by current standards. No system was ever implemented, so it is unclear how such a system would perform in practice. Landauer and Littman [9] proposed a method for cross-lingual retrieval. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) <ref> [6] </ref> was used to create a multidimensional indexing space for a small parallel corpus of English documents and their French translations. Their method has been successful at retrieving a query's translation. However, no reports of effectiveness on the traditional retrieval task have been reported.

Reference-contexts: Feedback after translation (post-translation) should reduce the effects of irrelevant query terms by adding more context specific terms. 3 Experiments To make these studies more tractable, we limited ourselves to two languages: Spanish and English. The English queries consisted of the description fields of TREC <ref> [7] </ref> topics 151-171 and the Spanish queries consisted of TREC topics SP26-45. Evaluation was performed on the English documents contained in the 2 GB TREC (vol. 2) collection and the 208 MB TREC ISM (El Norte) Spanish collection using relevance judgments for each mono-language query-set/database pair.

Reference-contexts: Ambiguity arising from the word-by-word translation of phrases is one of the remaining factors in the loss of performance. We are currently investigating methods to address this problem. One means for doing so is to create a bi-lingual phrase dictionary from MRD information. INFINDER <ref> [8] </ref>, which automatically builds a corpus based association thesaurus, may also be useful for identifying the context in which certain words are used. 6 Acknowledgments Access to the Collins bi-lingual MRDs was greatly facilitated by the use of tools such as NORM at the CRL lab at New Mexico State University.

Reference-contexts: Some terms had no correct mapping from French to English, and vice-versa. The test collection was also very small by current standards. No system was ever implemented, so it is unclear how such a system would perform in practice. Landauer and Littman <ref> [9] </ref> proposed a method for cross-lingual retrieval.

Reference-contexts: However, simple translations tend to be ambiguous and give poor results. Our main hypothesis is that query expansion via "local feedback" will improve the retrieval effectiveness of simple dictionary translation.

The thesaurus classes acted as an interlingua between the two sets of documents.
