Reference-contexts: It is clear, however, that it is possible to define a DB-MAT using more complex distance definitions, such as the Chanfrein distance, for instance <ref> [1] </ref>. For d 4 and d 8 , extraction of the corresponding DB-MAT has been characterized using the Distance Transform of the image [16].

Reference-contexts: The definition of block generalizes this notion. Definition 5 A k-block in an object is a group of k fi k pixels included in the object. Note that a k-block may be well represented by a label k associated to its upper-left corner pixel. In <ref> [2] </ref>, considering the grid E which is the support of the image, a derived grid of E was defined. <p> Definition 8 A pixel x 2 E is a pixel of the DB-MAT in a given metric, if it is a locally non null maximum with regard to its Distance Transform value in the same metric. As shown in <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, a DB-MAT can also be computed in the derived grid, having some interesting properties, the most important being the thickness of the obtained medial axis transform.

Reference-contexts: Besides the papers referenced thus far, of great importance for our results is the computation of the medial axis on the oversampled image that was described in <ref> [3] </ref>. Most of these results will be recalled in the next Section. In the parallel setting, also, extensive research has been carried out in connection to the computation of the medial axis transform of binary images. <p> Definition 8 A pixel x 2 E is a pixel of the DB-MAT in a given metric, if it is a locally non null maximum with regard to its Distance Transform value in the same metric. As shown in <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, a DB-MAT can also be computed in the derived grid, having some interesting properties, the most important being the thickness of the obtained medial axis transform. <p> are as follows: D 1 (S) = S [ fx 0 2 E + : jfV 0 and 4 (x)g: Before studying MAT algorithms in the derived grid, we give some structural results on the connectivities of S and D i (S), i = 1; 2, that we borrow from <ref> [3] </ref>. Proposition 1 An object S is 4-connected in E if and only if D 1 (S) is 8-connected in E 0 .

Reference-contexts: The distance based extraction of a medial axis transform is related to the distance transform of the image. Therefore, this latter problem received considerable attention in the literature. In particular, Bitz and Kung proposed a systolic implementation in <ref> [4] </ref>. Based on such algorithm, Miguet and Robert designed a distance transform algorithm for MIMD computers ([11]).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the most important problems in pattern recognition lies in shape representation, which is both an issue related to data reduction and data description. In <ref> [5] </ref>, a shape descriptor named medial axis was described that allows a full reconstruction of the original shape and that has good properties for data reduction [13, 14]. <p> The subject of this paper is the digital medial axis of an object from a binary image, which is a derivative of the medial axis originally proposed in <ref> [5] </ref>. Unfortunately, it is well known that such transpositions, from continuous to digital cases, raise many problems [6, 18]. In this case, working in a discrete space implies that fire wavefronts are symbolized by contour lines, and disks become of squared form.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we shall represent a block in E by its upper-left corner, labeled with the length of its sides. The algorithm presented in rectangles that cover a given object S is NP-hard <ref> [7] </ref>. In the following Section we introduce some relationships among MATs in order to derive a new BB-MAT algorithm. 3 A new BB-MAT algorithm In the following, we shall show how to use the DB-MAT in the derived grid in order to compute the BB-MAT in the original grid.

Reference-contexts: Lu and Varman studied the distance transform on mesh-connected computers in [10], and Jenq and Sahni obtained a parallel algorithm for a dynamic programming solution of the medial axis transform block-based version -, that can be implemented on a CREW PRAM with N 2 processors, in time O (log N) <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Finally, a work-optimal EREW-PRAM algorithm was given by Kim in <ref> [9] </ref>, in time O (log N ) with N 2 = log N processors. 1.2 This paper The work-optimal algorithm from [9] is based on a divide-and-conquer approach where the original problem of size S is partitioned into problems of size p S, and this recursively. <p> Finally, a work-optimal EREW-PRAM algorithm was given by Kim in <ref> [9] </ref>, in time O (log N ) with N 2 = log N processors. 1.2 This paper The work-optimal algorithm from [9] is based on a divide-and-conquer approach where the original problem of size S is partitioned into problems of size p S, and this recursively. Therefore, it is of complex implementation even in the EREW-PRAM. <p> Our algorithm is the first that is practical and yields time and/or work-optimal implementations of DB-MAT in various parallel architectures. For instance, in contrast with <ref> [9] </ref>, it can be work-optimally implemented also in Hypercubes in time O (log N) with N 2 = log N processors.

Reference-contexts: Therefore the centers of disks of the d 4 -DB-MAT (or d 8 -DB-MAT) correspond to local maxima in the Distance Transform of the image, with their corresponding radius equal to the label of each center <ref> [12] </ref>. A pixel p labeled r p in the Distance Transform is part of the DB-MAT if, for all pixel in its neighborhood, there is d 4 Distance Transform d 8 Distance Transform no pixel with a label in the Distance Transform that is larger then r p .

Reference-contexts: In [5], a shape descriptor named medial axis was described that allows a full reconstruction of the original shape and that has good properties for data reduction <ref> [13, 14] </ref>. The medial axis of a continuous object can be defined with the help of the fire grass concept, where the object is seen as a meadow, and a fire is lit along its contour such that all fire fronts invade the object with the same speed.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the digital Medial Axis Transform (MAT for short) is defined as a recovering of the object by maximal digital disks included in the object, where a digital disk is said to be maximal if it is not included in any other digital disk contained in the object <ref> [15] </ref>.

The Distance Transform of an object from an N fi N binary picture in E consists of labeling each pixel i of the object with the size of the maximal disk centered in i that is included in the object.
