Abstract: This document describes a detailed model of IPv4 multicast with RSVP that has been developed using the OPNET simulation package [4], with protocol procedures defined in the C language. The model was developed to allow investigation of performance constraints on routing but should have wide applicability in the Internet multicast/resource reservation community. We are making this model publicly available with the intention that it can be used to provide expanded studies of resource-reserved multicasting.

Reference-contexts: The RSVP protocol <ref> [2] </ref> has been developed for this purpose and is the subject of ongoing implementation efforts. Although the developers of RSVP have used simulation in their design process, no RFC 2490 IP Multicast with RSVP January 1999 Pullen, et. al. <p> RFC 2490 IP Multicast with RSVP January 1999 Pullen, et. al. Informational [Page 15] 4. RSVP model The current version of the RSVP model supports only fixed-filter reservation style. The following processing takes place in the indicated modules. The model is current with <ref> [2] </ref>. 4.1 RSVP Application 4.1.1 Init Initializes all variables and loads the distribution functions for Multicast Group IDs, Data, termination of the session. Transit to Idle state after completing all the initializations. 4.1.2 Idle This state has transitions to two states, Join and Data_Send.

Reference-contexts: An addition or modification of a routing module in any subnet will reflect on all the subnets. 6. OSPF and MOSPF Models OSPF and MOSPF models <ref> [5] </ref> are implemented in the OSPF model containing fourteen states. They only exist on routers. Figure 10 shows the process model. The following processing takes place in the indicated modules. 6.1 init This state initializes all the router variables. Default transition to idle state.
