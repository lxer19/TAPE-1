Reference-contexts: One can also state and investigate versions of the isomorphism conjecture for more restrictive reducibilities. In fact, there has been previous work presenting classes of reductions R such that the R-complete sets in natural (unrelativized) complexity classes are all isomorphic (see e.g. <ref> [Ag94] </ref>). <p> However, this work has all relied on the fact that the reductions in R can all be inverted in polynomial time. (For instance, the 1-L and 1-NL reductions in <ref> [Ag94, Ag95] </ref> and earlier work, and the first-order projections considered in [ABI93] have this property.) A possible exception is the so-called "1-omL reducibility" considered in [Ag94], which shares the non-invertibility property of NC 0 and AC 0 reductions considered here. <p> all relied on the fact that the reductions in R can all be inverted in polynomial time.

A possible exception is the so-called "1-omL reducibility" considered in <ref> [Ag94] </ref>, which shares the non-invertibility property of NC 0 and AC 0 reductions considered here. However 1-omL reducibility is a rather contrived reducibility invented solely for the purpose of proving the "collapse" result in [Ag94], and the proof of that result relies heavily on the invertibility of the related 1-L and <p> considered in [ABI93] have this property.)

(Additionally, the full version of this paper will show that the sets that are complete under the reducibilities considered in <ref> [Ag94] </ref> are in fact complete under logspace-uniform projections, and hence are also complete under NC 0 reductions.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The notion of complete sets in complexity classes provides one of the most useful tools currently available for classifying the complexity of computational problems. Since the mid-1970's, one of the most durable conjectures about the nature of complete sets is the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture <ref> [BH77] </ref>, which states that all sets complete for NP (under polynomial-time many-one reductions) are p-isomorphic; essentially this conjecture states that the complete sets are all merely different encodings of the same set. <p> The shortcoming of [ABI93] to which we refer is this: the complete degree under first-order projections is properly contained in the isomorphism type of the complete sets. In order to improve the result in [ABI93] to obtain a true analog of the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture <ref> [BH77] </ref> it would be necessary to show that the complete degree under first-order reductions coincides exactly with the first-order isomorphism type of the complete sets. <p> Berman and Hartmanis conjectured in <ref> [BH77] </ref> that all sets complete for NP under poly-time many-one reductions are P-isomorphic. Following the lead of [ABI93] we have considered the analogous question, where polynomial-time reductions and isomorphisms are replaced by AC 0 -computable reductions and isomorphisms.

Reference-contexts: For an excellent survey, see [KMR90]. We do want to call attention to two general trends this work has taken, regarding (1) one-way functions, and (2) more restrictive reducibilities. One-way functions are functions that are easy to compute but hard to invert. Beginning with <ref> [JY85] </ref> (see also [KMR95, Se92, KLD86], among others) many authors have noticed that if one-way functions exist, then the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture seems unlikely. <p> (2) projections are easily invertible in AC 0 , whereas NC 0 reductions are not invertible in polynomial time unless P=NP. (In-vertibility is relevant here, since the likely existence of non-invertible poly-time reductions is one of the main considerations leading many researchers to conjecture that the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture is false <ref> [JY85] </ref>.) We use our main result about NC 0 -reducibility to show that a true analog of the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture does hold for NC 1 . (That is, the sets complete under AC 0 reductions are all AC 0 -isomorphic.) Finally, we show that our approach cannot yield the analog of

Reference-contexts: However, the focus of our work is on non-relativized classes. Note also that it has been shown in <ref> [KMR88, JPY94] </ref> that there are (non-complete) degrees where isomorphisms can be constructed; however the focus of our work is on complete degrees.) It is important to observe that there are one-way functions in NC 0 if there are any one-way functions at all.

Reference-contexts: For an excellent survey, see [KMR90]. We do want to call attention to two general trends this work has taken, regarding (1) one-way functions, and (2) more restrictive reducibilities. One-way functions are functions that are easy to compute but hard to invert. Beginning with [JY85] (see also <ref> [KMR95, Se92, KLD86] </ref>, among others) many authors have noticed that if one-way functions exist, then the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture seems unlikely.

Reference-contexts: However, the focus of our work is on non-relativized classes. Note also that it has been shown in <ref> [KMR88, JPY94] </ref> that there are (non-complete) degrees where isomorphisms can be constructed; however the focus of our work is on complete degrees.) It is important to observe that there are one-way functions in NC 0 if there are any one-way functions at all.

Reference-contexts: It is worth noting that, with this definition, the class of Dlogtime-uniform AC 0 -computable functions admits many alternative characterizations, including expressibility in first-order with f+; fi; g, <ref> [Li94, BIS90] </ref> the logspace-rudimentary reductions of Jones [Jo75, AG91], logarithmic-time alternating Turing machines with O (1) alternations [BIS90] and others. This lends additional weight to our choice of this definition.

Reference-contexts: The procedure accepts iff this bit is 1. Thus, L 2 DTIME (n). Since L was an arbitrary language in NTIME (n), we have shown that NTIME (n) = DTIME (n), which is a contradiction, since it is known that DTIME (n) is properly contained in NTIME (n) <ref> [PPS83] </ref>. 5 Conclusions In closing, let us summarize our results. Berman and Hartmanis conjectured in [BH77] that all sets complete for NP under poly-time many-one reductions are P-isomorphic.

Reference-contexts: Beginning with [JY85] (see also [KMR95, Se92, KLD86], among others) many authors have noticed that if one-way functions exist, then the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture seems unlikely. In particular, if f is one-way, nobody has presented a general technique for constructing a p-isomorphism between SAT and f (SAT). (Rogers <ref> [Ro95] </ref> does show how to construct such isomorphisms relative to an oracle. However, the focus of our work is on non-relativized classes.
