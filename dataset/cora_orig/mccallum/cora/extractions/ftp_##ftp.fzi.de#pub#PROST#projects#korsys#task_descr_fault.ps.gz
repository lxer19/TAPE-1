Abstract: In this paper we describe the control specification of a production cell with a fault-tolerant control program. We have extended the case study Production Cell [Lewe95]by adding a second press, additional sensors and some light systems. Additionally, we have provided equipment for supervising certain timing aspects of the system. In the first case study, we assumed that component failure was impossible. Now, controlling the system has become more difficult, since failures of components have to be taken into account. A revised list of safety and liveness properties completes the task description.

Reference-contexts: 1. Description of the Plant In <ref> [Lewe95] </ref>, the layout of the case study Production Cell is described. The architecture of the modified production cell, which is described in this paper and shown in Fig. 1, differs from the original one in the following way: 1. <p> For this purpose, a global system clock provides the current time at any instant. 2 Task Description of a Fault-Tolerant Production Cell 2. Operation of the System The production cycle for a single metal blank does not differ from the process in <ref> [Lewe95] </ref>. If the signal at the beginning of the feed belt shows green, a blank may be added to the feed belt. The blank is conveyed to the elevating rotary table. The robot picks the blank up using its first arm, and puts the blank into a unoccupied press. <p> If one of the presses is not functioning, steps 1 to 4 or 5 to 8 are skipped, respectively. In this case, the production process is completely identical to the original cycle in the basic cell <ref> [Lewe95] </ref>. press 2 deposit belt feed belt elevating rotary table arm 1 arm 2 robot press 1 Abbildung 1 Fault-Tolerant Production Cell (top view and side view) traffic light for insertion traffic light for deposit S1 S9 S4 S3 S2 S 16 S12 S14 S18 S19 S7 S6 system clock alarm
