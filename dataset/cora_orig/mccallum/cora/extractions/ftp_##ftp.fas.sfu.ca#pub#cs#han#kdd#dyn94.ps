Abstract: Concept hierarchies organize data and concepts in hierarchical forms or in certain partial order, which helps expressing knowledge and data relationships in databases in concise, high level terms, and thus, plays an important role in knowledge discovery processes. Concept hierarchies could be provided by knowledge engineers, domain experts or users, or embedded in some data relations. However, it is sometimes desirable to automatically generate some concept hierarchies or adjust some given hierarchies for particular learning tasks. In this paper, the issues of dynamic generation and refinement of concept hierarchies are studied. The study leads to some algorithms for automatic generation of concept hierarchies for numerical attributes based on data distributions and for dynamic refinement of a given or generated concept hierarchy based on a learning request, the relevant set of data and database statistics. These algorithms have been implemented in the DBLearn knowledge discovery system and tested against large relational databases. The experimental results show that the algorithms are efficient and effective for knowledge discovery in large databases.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction With the rapid growth in size and number of available databases in commercial, industrial, administrative and other applications <ref> [5] </ref>, it is necessary and interesting to examine how to extract knowledge automatically from huge amounts of data. <p> Therefore, knowledge discovery in databases (or data mining) has been considered as one of the most important research topics in 1990s by both machine learning and database researchers [17, 20]. There are different philosophical considerations on knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) <ref> [5, 23] </ref>, which may lead to different methodologies in the development of KDD techniques [5, 11, 6, 18, 1, 21, 22, 23].

For Alternative 1, generalization on a prime generalized relation is performed until the number of distinct generalized tuples in the resulting relation is no greater than a prespecified relation threshold. At this stage, there are usually alternative choices for selecting a candidate attribute for further generalization.

The system takes learning requests as inputs, applies the knowledge discovery algorithm (s) on the data stored in a database, with the assistance of the concept hierarchy information stored in a concept hierarchy base.

Interesting rules can often be discovered by following different paths leading to several generalized relations for examination, comparison and selection, which can be performed interactively by users or experts [23].
