Abstract: Let S be a set of n pairwise disjoint segments in R 3 , and let B be a ball. We show that the combinatorial complexity of the free configuration space F of B amidst S, i.e., the set of all placements of B at which B does not intersect any segment of S, is O(n 8=3+" ), for any " &gt; 0, with the constant of proportionality depending on ". This is the first subcubic bound on the complexity of the free configuration space even when S is a set of lines in R 3 . (In this case F is the complement of the union of n congruent cylinders in R 3 , and our results yield an O(n 8=3+" ) bound on the complexity of such a union.) We also present a randomized algorithm that can compute the boundary of the free configuration space in O(n 8=3+" ) expected time. Our technique also yields subcubic bounds on the combinatorial complexity of the union of certain families of n more general convex sets in R 3 . fl Work by P.A. was supported by Army Research Office MURI grant DAAH04-96-1-0013, by a Sloan fellowship, by an NYI award, and by a grant from the U.S.-Israeli Binational Science Foundation.

Reference-contexts: Q. (Informally, the partition into prisms allows us to regard vertices of the union within a prism as vertices of the region enclosed between an upper envelope and a lower envelope of appropriate portions of the cylindrical surfaces, and such a region has a near-quadratic complexity by the results of <ref> [3] </ref>.) Using this result and a double-counting argument, we bound the size of V 0 . Putting all these steps together we obtain the desired bound on V . We now describe each step in detail.
