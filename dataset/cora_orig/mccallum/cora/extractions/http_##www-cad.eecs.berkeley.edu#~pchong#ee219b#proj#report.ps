Title: Using Don't Cares in Logic Minimization for LUT-Based FPGAs  
Author: Philip Chong 
Date: May 25, 1997  
Abstract: Don't care information has proven to be useful in logic minimization. Here, the use of don't care information in network collapsing for mapping to LUT-based FPGAs is explored. Results are shown which indicate that this approach does not result in appreciable improvements in network size.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Don't care (DC) information of logic networks has successfully been used in a general-purpose logic synthesis framework <ref> [2] </ref>. However, using don't care information for minimization of lookup table-based field programmable gate arrays (LUT-based FPGAs) does not appear to be well-studied. Indeed, other works in LUT minimization have deliberately avoided using DC conditions [3]. <p> In this project, we discuss the possibility of using DC information in mapping logic networks to LUTs, and show some preliminary results of one technique which was implemented. 2 FPGA Mapping Using SIS SIS is able to map logic networks to LUTs using its built-in functions <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> Column A shows the results obtained using standard SIS and the LUT mapping script presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. Column B shows the results obtained by modifying the collapsing procedure in the routine xl partition; this routine is used to collapse the network after a thorough decomposition.

Another experiment would be to actually implement the use of CSPFs in xl cover and compare the results to 3 that of using simplify.

Reference-contexts: Central to this mapping is the function xl cover, which uses an exhaustive approach to try to obtain the best covering of a given logic network with LUTs (heuristics can be used instead of exact methods to reduce running time) <ref> [4] </ref>. xl cover starts with a m-feasible network (a network where every node has at most m inputs); clearly such a network can be trivially mapped to a network of m-input LUTS. xl cover attempts to improve on the existing network by: * Finding all m-cuts of the network (all sets

Reference-contexts: Note that xl cover is limited by the structure of the initial network; nodes are never decomposed by xl cover to obtain better results. 3 Initial Approach The inital suggestion to approaching the use of DCs in FPGA mapping was suggested by Rajeev Murgai <ref> [5] </ref>. The idea here was to use the don't care information to give xl cover more flexibility.
