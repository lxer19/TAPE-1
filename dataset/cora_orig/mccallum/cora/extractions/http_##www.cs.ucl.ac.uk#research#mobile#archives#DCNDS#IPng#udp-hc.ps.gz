Abstract: Low-speed wireless is becoming a popular way to connect mobile computers to the Internet and other networks. Users will desire the same services on low speed links as they already have on higher speed networks. Since bandwidth will probably always be a limitation on wide area wireless links, protocol mechanisms need to be developed to use the available bandwidth on low speed networks efficiently. In the face of growing address sizes, such as those in IPv6, we offer a header compression scheme that enables efficient use of bandwidth when packets are small. The scheme uses soft state, works over simplex links, supports multicast transmission for real time applications, and besides providing more usable bandwidth on wireless links, allows better utilization of gateways and servers attached to wireless networks.

Reference-contexts: When packets are tunneled across a wireless network, e.g., to support mobility <ref> [1, 8, 9] </ref>, or when extra routing information is added to an IPv6 header [4, section 4.4], the bandwidth needed for headers alone can approach 50 kbit/s. With header compression, IPv6/UDP headers can be reduced to 4 bytes and 20 ms packets would only require 1.6 kbit/s for the headers.

Reference-contexts: We present a method of doing this that requires no upstream messages, and thus can be used over simplex links. The scheme makes use of soft state, a form of state storage introduced by Clark <ref> [2] </ref> and used, for example, in the RSVP resource reservation protocol [10] to make efficient use of Internet router and link resources.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the receivers of a multicast flow may be heterogeneous in the sense that some may not be capable of decompression, and the compressor needs a method to determine this. By a utilizing an existing mechanism (IGMP <ref> [3] </ref>) for determining if there are members of a multicast group on a shared medium, this problem can be solved.

Reference-contexts: With a 28.8 kbit/s modem there will be bandwidth to spare or room for higher quality audio. We are now implementing our header compression scheme in NetBSD, and are planning an implementation for SOLARIS. In addition, we have submitted our header compression scheme as a draft <ref> [5] </ref> to the IPng working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force. 10 Conclusion We have shown how to compress packet headers sent over slow-speed lossy links such as wireless.

Reference-contexts: In our header compression scheme, soft state promotes better resource utilization on wireless and other low-bandwidth links and gateways. 2 Related work Jacobson <ref> [6] </ref> has developed a header compression scheme for TCP streams over point-to-point links. The scheme uses incremental encoding, and can rely on the TCP checksum to discard incorrectly decompressed packets. The compressor peeks into the TCP headers to determine when TCP retransmits.

Reference-contexts: A complete header compression module would use Ja-cobson's methods for TCP streams and our methods for non-TCP streams. There are header compression schemes, for example a scheme for IPX <ref> [7] </ref>, where compressor and de-compressor perform a handshake whenever the stored header must change.

Soft state can provide better utilization of scarce resources in a mobile server that functions as the gateway from the wireline Internet to a wireless link.
