Abstract: Parameterized heuristics offers an elegant and powerful theoretical framework for design and analysis of autonomous adaptive communication networks. Routing of messages in such networks presents a real-time instance of a multi-criterion optimization problem in a dynamic and uncertain environment. This paper describes a framework for heuristic routing in large networks. The effectiveness of the heuristic routing mechanism upon which Quo Vadis is based is described as part of a simulation study within a network with grid topology. A formal analysis of the underlying principles is presented through the incremental design of a set of heuristic decision functions that can be used to guide messages along a near-optimal (e.g., minimum delay) path in a large network. This paper carefully derives the properties of such heuristics under a set of simplifying assumptions about the network topology and load dynamics and identify the conditions under which they are guaranteed to route messages along an optimal path. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relevance of the theoretical results presented in the paper to the design of intelligent autonomous adaptive communication networks and an outline of some directions of future research.

For each message received, the routing algorithm at each node must select a neighboring node to which the message is to be sent.

Reference-contexts: The work described in this paper is a step toward the development of a theoretical framework for the design and the analysis of such heuristics. In what follows, we draw upon concepts of decision theory <ref> (French 1986) </ref> to design and analyze a set of heuristics for routing in large mesh networks. First, we describe the design of Quo Vadis, a framework for heuristic routing functions, and present its experimental analysis. We then describe and analyze the design of various heuristics. <p> Our proposed solution to this problem involves the implicit use of utility-theoretic heuristics. Utility is a measure that quantifies a decision maker's preference for one action over another (relative to some criteria to be maximized) <ref> (French 1986) </ref>. When the result of an action is uncertain, it is convenient to use the expected utility of each action to pick actions which maximize the expected utility.

The work described in this paper is a step toward the development of a theoretical framework for the design and the analysis of such heuristics. <p> Ideally, it must adequately summarize the load values in large regions of the network as viewed from a given node. These considerations (among others) led us to define a view, V k , which is maintained in every node in the network <ref> (Mikler, Wong, & Honavar 1994) </ref>. In a rectangular grid network, this view consists of four components, one for each of the four directions north, south, east, and west.

Reference-contexts: The significance attached to the state (e.g., load) of a node to routing decisions made by another node in the network should be an inverse function of the distance between the two nodes <ref> (Snyder, 1989) </ref>. 3. The number of routes of comparable length between a source node n with coordinates (X n ; Y n ) and a destination node d with coordinates (X d ; Y d ) is a non-decreasing function of the distance between the two nodes.
