Abstract: We present a refutation system for intuitionistic logic which allows to locate situations where constructive reasoning is unnecessary. In many subgoals of a derivation this property makes it possible to reduce the set of relevant reduction rules to a confluent one. As a result, backtracking over choicepoints for different orderings of non-permutable rules can often be avoided and the search space will be reduced considerably.

The reason for this is that a derivation in contraction-free calculi must backtrack over non-invertible reduction rules while in TJ A this formula can be proved essentially by classical reasoning. <p> Several approaches attempt to deal with the problem of avoiding to introduce the same construction several times. The contraction-free calculi for propositional (cf. <ref> [2, 6] </ref>) and for first-order intuitionistic logic (cf. [9]) have achieved considerable improvements to this problem. In particular, Hudelmaier's O (n log n)-space decision procedure [6] even avoids most of the additional backtracking problems we have mentioned in section 4.4.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Traditional calculi for intuitionistic logic <ref> [3, 4] </ref> are strictly constructive in the sense that they only allow constructive reasoning even if it is clear that a classical proof will lead to the same result. <p> Adequacy: Strictly constructive reasoning will not be performed if we can detect that a certain construction does not contribute to the evidence which is necessary for proving the theorem. Automation: Because of its formal similarity to Fitting's calculi <ref> [3] </ref> our calculus can be used as foundation for the development of improved matrix-methods in the style of Wallen [17] or improved translations into classical logic [11] which then will lead to more efficient proof procedures for intu itionistic logic Our paper is organized as follows. <p> By atomic formulas we mean formulas without logical con-nectives. A ground formula is a formula without occurrences of free variables. If not stated otherwise we assume every formula to be ground. The following definitions of intuitionistic interpretation, forcing, model and validity combine the respective definitions in <ref> [3] </ref> and [14]. Definition 1 Intuitionistic interpretation Let W be a non-empty set, R W fi W a transitive and reflexive relation (accessibility), D a mapping from W to non-empty subsets of C, and V an evaluation function mapping elements of W to sets of atomic ground formulas. <p> A is said to be intuitionistically valid (otherwise invalid ) | denoted as j= j A (6j= j A respectively) | iff every interpretation is a model for it. 2 Throughout this paper we will often refer to the intuitionistic Beth-tableaux system (see e.g. <ref> [3] </ref>) which we will denote by TJ. The corresponding classical tableaux system (see e.g. [15]) will be called TC and classical validity will be denoted by j= c (cf. [1]). <p> Then for any w 2 W: w A ) w fl A 2 The proof is a straightforward induction over the degree of A (see <ref> [3] </ref> for details). Basically, forcing is used to reflect the concept of known evidence for a formula. If A is forced at some w 2 W then it is known at w how to construct evidence for the validity of A. <p> However, in addition to the signs T and F we introduce a third sign T. Its purpose will be explained later. Definition 3 Signed formula Let A be a formula. Then TA, TA and FA are signed formulas . 2 The next definition extends the definition of rules in <ref> [3] </ref> by a concept of prefixes: Definition 4 Prefixed set of signed formulas, reduction rule Let P be a list of formulas and S be a set of signed formulas. <p> Then there is a TJ A -proof for A. 2 The proofs for both theorems basically follow the line of the respective proofs for the soundness and completeness of TJ given in <ref> [3] </ref>. The informal justifications for the modifications of the TJ-rules introduced by TJ A which we presented in the previous section were used at the respective places in a formalized manner. <p> and the same property must hold for every polarity 0 subformula of the form 9x:A 1 . 4.3 A connection with classical logic In this section we will show an important correlation between classical and intu-itionistic validity which follows from the specific properties of TJ A and generalize results from <ref> [3, chapter 4x8] </ref>. For this purpose we define for a PSSF P : S the set C (S) as fTAjTA 2 Sg [ fFAjFA 2 Sg. <p> Then j= j ::A iff j= c A. 2 Our results include formulas with universally quantified subformulas of polarity 1 and hence generalize theorem 8.3 in <ref> [3] </ref>. Furthermore we could achieve them on a proof-theoretical basis as opposed to the model-theoretical argumentation in [3]. 4.4 Search space In the proof for lemma 2 we have uncovered a general equivalence of proof search in TJ A and TC for a special class of PSSFs, namely for those PSSFs <p> Then j= j ::A iff j= c A. 2 Our results include formulas with universally quantified subformulas of polarity 1 and hence generalize theorem 8.3 in <ref> [3] </ref>. Furthermore we could achieve them on a proof-theoretical basis as opposed to the model-theoretical argumentation in [3]. 4.4 Search space In the proof for lemma 2 we have uncovered a general equivalence of proof search in TJ A and TC for a special class of PSSFs, namely for those PSSFs P : S where P has the form :X:P 0 and no formula A with ffiA 2 <p> In addition to the computational properties of TJ A we have used our calculus as a concept providing an extended perspective for theoretical insights into properties of intuitionistic logic e.g. the equivalence of classical and intuitionistic validity for a larger formula class than the one presented by Fitting <ref> [3] </ref>. Several approaches attempt to deal with the problem of avoiding to introduce the same construction several times. The contraction-free calculi for propositional (cf. [2, 6]) and for first-order intuitionistic logic (cf. [9]) have achieved considerable improvements to this problem.

Reference-contexts: Our perspective for further work includes the development of matrix and translation methods based on TJ A which is currently in progress. A first spin-off from these efforts is presented in <ref> [7] </ref>. Additionally we are working on several improvements to the TJ A -system. As mentioned in section 4.2 a suitable concept of reducing the number of possible F-9 and T-8 applications is desirable in order to obtain decidability for a considerably larger class of formulas.

Reference-contexts: If the polarity is 0 then the subformula will occur F-signed and otherwise T-signed or T-signed. 4.1 Soundness and completeness In <ref> [8] </ref> we have shown that our refinement of TJ is sound and complete. Theorem 2 Soundness of the system Let A be a formula such that there is a TJ A -proof for A. <p> The informal justifications for the modifications of the TJ-rules introduced by TJ A which we presented in the previous section were used at the respective places in a formalized manner. Since the proofs cover several pages we refer to our technical report <ref> [8] </ref> for details. 4.2 Deciding validity According to the reflections at the end of section 3.2 the following theorem shows that intuitionistic validity can be decided by TJ A for the propositional fragment: Theorem 4 Finite search space for propositional formulas Let A be a formula with no quantifier. <p> By a complete case analysis we can show that for any propositional rule the premises are always smaller w.r.t. &lt; p than the conclusion (see <ref> [8] </ref> for details). Since no reduction rule can be applied anymore if g A (P : S) = 0, the tableau construction must terminate after finitely many steps.
