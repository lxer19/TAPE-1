Abstract: Dear readers, Thanks to automated agenda, the conferences now will be kept on-line at a better rate. Please consult CG Tribune's (WWW) page for conferences, where I keep a link to the conference server and a copy of the email call for papers. I hope you can take good advantage of this web site. Don't hesitate to signal me which conference you're looking for and didn't tnd, or to send me your suggestions. Many thanks to all the (many) contributors.

Reference-contexts: The corresponding claim for the perimeter of S and B has been proven false in general by Habicht, see [KW91]. However, under the assumption that A can be continuously moved into B such that the distance between any two centers decreases monotonously, Bollobas <ref> [Bol68] </ref> proved that both the perimeter and the area of the disk union decrease. We present an easy proof of the perimeter claim. The proof for the area follows easily from the result for the perimeter [Bol68]. <p> moved into B such that the distance between any two centers decreases monotonously, Bollobas <ref> [Bol68] </ref> proved that both the perimeter and the area of the disk union decrease. We present an easy proof of the perimeter claim. The proof for the area follows easily from the result for the perimeter [Bol68]. For any radius 0 r 1, call A r be the set of disks of radius r having the same centers as A. In particular, A = A 1 .
