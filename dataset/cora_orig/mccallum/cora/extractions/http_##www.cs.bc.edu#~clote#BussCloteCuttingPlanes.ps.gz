Title: Cutting planes, connectivity, and threshold logic  
Author: Samuel R. Buss Peter Clote 
Date: October 19, 1995  
Abstract: Originating from work in operations research the cutting plane refutation system CP is an extension of resolution, where unsatisfiable propositional logic formulas in conjunctive normal form are recognized by showing the non-existence of boolean solutions to associated families of linear inequalities. Polynomial size CP proofs are given for the undirected s-t connectivity principle. The subsystems CP q of CP , for q 2, are shown to be polynomially equivalent to CP , thus answering problem 19 from the list of open problems of [8]. We present a normal form theorem for CP 2 -proofs and thereby for arbitrary CP -proofs. As a corollary, we show that the coefficients and constant terms in arbitrary cutting plane proofs may be exponentially bounded by the number of steps in the proof, at the cost of an at most polynomial increase in the number of steps in the proof. The extension CP LE + , introduced in [9] and there shown to p-simulate Frege systems, is proved to be polynomially equivalent to Frege systems. Lastly, since linear inequalities are related to threshold gates, we introduce a new threshold logic and prove a completeness theorem. Mathematics Subject Classification: 03B05, 03F07, 03F20, 90C10.

Reference-contexts: This proof of Theorem 7 is in the appendix. 9 5 Undirected and directed s-t connectivity It is well-known that there is sometimes a difference in the computational complexity (or definability) of undirected versus directed graph properties. In particular, Ajtai and Fagin <ref> [2] </ref> proved that connectivity for undirected graphs is not definable in monadic second order logic, whereas connectivity for directed graphs is so definable. In this section, we investigate the proof theoretic strength of the undirected and directed forms of s-t connectivity.
