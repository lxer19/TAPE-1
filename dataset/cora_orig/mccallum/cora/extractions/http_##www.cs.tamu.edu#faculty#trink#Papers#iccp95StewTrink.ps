Title: DYNAMICS, FRICTION, AND COMPLEMENTARITY PROBLEMS  
Author: D.E. STEWART ; AND J.C. TRINKLE ; 
Keyword: Key Words. friction, differential inclusions, rigid body dynamics, complementarity problem  
Abstract: An overview is presented here of recent work and approaches to solving dynamic problems in rigid body mechanics with friction. It begins with the differential inclusion approach to Coulomb friction where the normal contact force is known. Numerical methods for these differential inclusions commonly lead to linear or nonlinear complementarity problems. Then the measure differential inclusion formulation of rigid body dynamics due to Moreau and others is presented. A novel algorithm for time-stepping for rigid body dynamics is given which avoids the "non-existence" issues that arise in many other formulations. The time-stepping algorithm requires the solution of an NCP at each step. Results on the convergence of the numerical solutions to solutions in the sense of measure differential inclusions are given, and numerical results for an implementation of the method are shown. 1. Introduction. This paper presents an overview of some recent progress in

Reference-contexts: Inclined plane problem with friction The resolution of this difficulty is to extend the notion of differential equation to differential inclusion: m dt where Sgn v = &lt; f+1g v &gt; 0 <ref> [1; +1] </ref> v = 0: This approach is implicitly used in most introductory treatments of friction. <p> These problems are known to be equivalent to linear complementarity problems [9], and furthermore, the methods used to solve such problems by continuation or homotopy methods <ref> [1] </ref> are exactly analogous to the pivoting algorithms of Lemke and Howson [18], Cottle and Dantzig [3], and others. 1.3.

Reference-contexts: Because of the discontinuity in the friction force term, (1) can no longer be guaranteed to have solutions once v (t) = 0. (Even Caratheodory's existence theorem <ref> [2] </ref> fails to apply.) Yet, in physically reasonable situations, v may be zero. In the context of figure 1, if the slope is small enough, and the external forces F ext (t) are also small enough, v will reach zero in finite time.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction. This paper presents an overview of some recent progress in dealing with rigid body dynamics incorporating collisions, shocks and Coulomb friction, with special emphasis on the difficulties due to friction. Circa 1781 Coulomb introduced a model of the frictional forces at the contact between solid bodies <ref> [8, pp. 319-322] </ref>. This model stated that the frictional forces between two such bodies is (the coefficient of friction) times the magnitude of the normal contact force in magnitude, and directed opposite to the direction of relative motion.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, by using a piecewise linear approximation to F (), the problem can be "reduced" to that of solving a piecewise linear system of equations. These problems are known to be equivalent to linear complementarity problems <ref> [9] </ref>, and furthermore, the methods used to solve such problems by continuation or homotopy methods [1] are exactly analogous to the pivoting algorithms of Lemke and Howson [18], Cottle and Dantzig [3], and others. 1.3.

Reference-contexts: The existence of solutions to the nonlinear version can be shown using Brouwer's fixed point theorem. (For a description of Brouwer's fixed point theorem and related results, such as the Kakutani fixed point theorem, see <ref> [13] </ref>.) These nonlinear versions can be solved quickly and accurately in practice by a simple iteration, where q l+1 is approximated by bq l+1 = q l + hv l , and the LCP (3) solved with M , n and ff 0 evaluated at bq l+1 .

Reference-contexts: For anisotropic contacts (such as occurs in ice-skating), a better model would be to choose the friction vector in the friction cone in the direction that maximizes the rate of energy loss (see, for example, Goyal <ref> [14] </ref>). In general we will assume that the friction law satisfies the the maximum work inequality, which is valid for both isotropic and anisotropic Coulomb friction.

Reference-contexts: In more intuitive language, F (x) is the convex hull of values of f () nearby, ignoring the behavior on null sets. (Related versions of the Filippov regularization were developed by Krasovskij, Hermes and others. A suitable review paper for this area is Hajek <ref> [15] </ref>.)

Reference-contexts: Approximation to circular friction cone This representation gives a great deal of flexibility; isotropic or anisotropic friction for contact in two or three dimensions, or even for soft finger models in which the frictional contact can support a frictional torque about the normal direction <ref> [16] </ref>, can be represented. In generalized coordinates, the d i (q) vectors may incorporate torques, as well as as ordinary forces. The friction direction vectors for an octagonal approximation to a circular friction cone are shown in Figure 3. Note that the frictional torques are not shown for clarity. 3.2.

Inelastic collisions are formulated by Moreau [22] and Monteiro-Marques <ref> [20] </ref> in terms of a maximal dissipation principle, where the choice of vector in the friction cone is made to maximize the rate of loss of energy (or amount of energy if there is an impulsive contact force). 3.
