Abstract: An automated design methodology incorporating industry-standard Navier-Stokes codes and a gradient-based optimizer has been developed. This system is used to redesign the well-known NASA P2 and P8 hypersonic inlets. First, the Navier-Stokes simulations of the original P2 and P8 inlet designs are validated using numerical convergence studies and comparison with wind-tunnel experimental data for the original inlets published by NASA in the early 1970s. Second, the P2 and P8 inlets are redesigned with the objective of canceling the cowl shock (and, in the case of the P8 inlet, the additional cowl-generated compression) at the centerbody by appropriate contouring of the centerbody boundary. The original inlets were intended to achieve these same objectives, but detailed experimental measurements indicated that a substantial reflected shock system was present. The choice of the objective function, which is used to drive the optimization, has a significant impact on the final design. Several different formulations for the objective function have been employed, and improvements of 60% to 90% in the objective function have been achieved. This automated design system represents one of the first successful combinations of numerical optimization methods with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes fluid dynamics simulation for high speed inlets, and demonstrates a new area in which High Performance Computing may have considerable impact on problems of military and industrial significance.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Recently there has been work on integrating design and computational fluid dynamics. Compared to wind-tunnel testing of designs, this process is lower cost and can be completed in a relatively short period of time. For example, experimentally validated Navier-Stokes codes have been developed and used for turbomachinery design <ref> [1] </ref>. Typically, these codes are used by expert designers, who guide the selection of designs and shape modifications. Improvements are achieved by a manual, labor intensive process. The complex flows in aerodynamic applications make it unlikely to attain optimum designs manually.

Reference-contexts: Recently there has been work to automate the design process. This involves description of the shape by a set of parameters and an objective function that describes the desired design goal. Aerodynamic shape optimization of inlets has been performed to minimize the peak inlet Mach number <ref> [2] </ref>. Nonlinear optimization has also been used in inlet design by coupling optimization with an inviscid flow solver to minimize total pressure loss [3].

Reference-contexts: We have developed a prototype software system that combines Navier-Stokes simulations and numerical optimization methods. This system has been tested by redesigning the P2 and P8 inlets. The P2 and P8 inlets <ref> [9] </ref> were designed in the 1970s for a proposed hypersonic cruise vehicle for Mach 10 to 12. Models were built at approximately 1/3 scale and tested in the NASA Ames 3.5 foot hypersonic wind tunnel. <p> To meet this objective, it was deemed essential to cancel the incident shock (and additional compression system in the case of the P8 inlet) through surface turning at the point of impingement of the shock on the centerbody <ref> [9] </ref>. The necessary surface turning was computed using the method of characteristics in conjunction with a boundary layer model. The experimental results, however, showed that the cowl shock was not cancelled by the centerbody contour for either inlet. <p> The cowl surface is unchanged, thereby yielding the same incident wave system as the original inlets. The achievement of our objective would imply an approximately uniform static pressure at the inlet throat, which is a condition generally considered desirable at the combustor entrance <ref> [9] </ref>. 3 2 Validation of CFD Codes It is essential to confirm that the flows in the P2 and P8 inlets, which are characterized by high Mach number, high gradient of flow variables near shocks and shock boundary layer interactions, are accurately predicted by the CFD codes. <p> Tables 1 and 2 show properties of each grid. In constructing the grids, the shape of the inlet is determined using spline interpolation through the (x; y) points specified in Table 1 of Gnos et al. <ref> [9] </ref>. However, the leading edge of the cowl is extended 2.79 cm upstream in order to correctly position the shock wave generated by the cowl. <p> Our grids use equal spacing in the x direction and exponential spacing in the y direction (near both the cowl and centerbody) with an upper limit on cell growth. The experimental data <ref> [9] </ref> indicate an incoming centerbody boundary layer thickness (ffi 0 ) of 1.1 cm, and Tables 1 and 2 show that the number of points our grids have in this centerbody boundary layer compares favorably with the 30 points suggested by the traditional rule of thumb. <p> During computations of the inlets the L2 residual drops by four orders of magnitude [18, 19]. Our flow simulations for the P2 and P8 inlets are in good agreement with experiments of Gnos et al. <ref> [9] </ref>, thereby justifying the use of GASP/NPARC in optimization. The results of this simulation are of similar accuracy to those obtained by other authors [10, 11, 12].
