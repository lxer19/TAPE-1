Abstract: Many complex biological systems are characterized both by incomplete models and limited empirical data. Accurate prediction of the behavior of such systems requires exploitation of multiple, individually incomplete, knowledge sources. Model-based adaptation is a technique for integrating case-based reasoning with model-based reasoning to predict the behavior of biological systems. This approach is implemented in CARMA, a system for rangeland grasshopper management advising that implements a process model derived from protocol analysis of human expert problem-solving episodes. CARMA's ability to predict the forage consumption judgments of expert pest managers was empirically compared to that of case-based and model-based reasoning techniques in isolation. This evaluation provided initial confirmation for the hypothesis that an

Reference-contexts: Moreover, while historical data often exist for such systems, they are often insufficient for accurate prediction using empirical methods. As illustrated in between highly analytic domains, such as celestial mechanics and the prediction of artifact behavior, and highly empirical domains, such as sociology <ref> [AH92] </ref>. In such biological systems, both models and empirical data exist, but neither is per se sufficient for accurate prediction. <p> While model-based reasoning can play a role in grasshopper management, there is a general recognition that the interactions affecting grasshopper population dynamics are too poorly understood and too complex to permit precise prediction through numerical simulation <ref> [LL91, Pim91, AH92] </ref>. However, entomologists and pest managers appear able to provide useful recommendations to ranchers. This indicates that other sources of knowledge can compensate for the absence of a complete model of rangeland ecosystems.

Reference-contexts: Various approaches to behavioral prediction are possible. In systems for which a precise model exists and accurate values of state variables can be determined, simulation can be used to predict the system's behavior. Alternatively, if there are sufficient historical data, empirical methods such as case-based reasoning (CBR) <ref> [AP94] </ref>, decision-tree induction [Qui93], or statistical techniques can be lead to accurate prediction. Precise models exist for the behavior of many simple physical systems.

Reference-contexts: Goel's use of device models to adapt design cases also presupposed that the device models are complete and correct [Goe91]. Similarly, Rajamoney and Lee's prototype-based reasoning [RL91] presupposed a complete and correct (though not necessarily tractable) causal model. Feret and Glascow <ref> [FG93] </ref> described an alterative approach under which model-based reasoning is used for "structural isolation" (i.e., identification of the structural components of a device that probably give rise to the symptoms of a fault). Cases are indexed by these tentative diagnoses, which are then refined using case-based reasoning.

Reference-contexts: Each of these management tasks requires evaluating alternative actions by predicting their potential consequences. The particular rangeland management task of interest to us is pest management. On average, grasshoppers annually consume 21-23% of rangeland forage in the west 3 ern United States, at an estimated loss of $400 million <ref> [HO83] </ref>. Rangeland grasshop-per infestations can be treated with chemical or biological insecticides, but in many situations the costs of insecticide application exceed the value of the forage saved.

Reference-contexts: However, these projects have generally assumed the existence of a correct and complete causal model. For example, CASEY <ref> [Kot88] </ref> performed diagnosis using model-based reasoning to assist both case matching and case adaptation. However, CASEY presupposed both the existence of a complete causal theory of heart disease and complete explanations of each case in terms of that theory.

Reference-contexts: 1 Prediction in Biological Systems Decision-support in agriculture and natural resources management often requires prediction of the behavior of biological systems. For example, providing advice about the optimal planting time for a crop may require predicting the emergence date of important pests of that crop <ref> [PS91] </ref>. Similarly, determining the most cost-effective response to a given pest infestation requires predicting crop or forage loss under each available option. Various approaches to behavioral prediction are possible.
