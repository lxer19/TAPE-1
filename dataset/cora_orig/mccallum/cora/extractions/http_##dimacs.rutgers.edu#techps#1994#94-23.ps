Reference-contexts: We call these varieties partition varieties. We interpret the rook length polynomials introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> as Poincare polynomials of partition varieties. The main theorem of this paper is Theorem 2.33. In [4], we introduced the idea of invisible permutations, the length function for rook placements on a Ferrers board, the partially ordered set of rook placements and rook length polynomials. <p> We call these varieties partition varieties. We interpret the rook length polynomials introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> as Poincare polynomials of partition varieties. The main theorem of this paper is Theorem 2.33. In [4], we introduced the idea of invisible permutations, the length function for rook placements on a Ferrers board, the partially ordered set of rook placements and rook length polynomials. <p> We proved a local formula for the length function of rook placements which evaluates the contribution of every rook to the length function individually. Then we gave a formula on the relationship between rook length polynomials and Garsia-Remmel polynomials. The major result in <ref> [4] </ref> is an explicit formula for rook length polynomials. As a consequence of this formula, we also obtained an explicit formula for Garsia-Remmel polynomials. In this paper, we study the geometric aspect of rook placements. <p> The cells of the CW-complex and their closures can be described combinatorially by means of sequences of Ferrers boards. This description leads to a combinatorial criterion for one cell being a subset of the closure of another cell. By using the idea of invisible permutations introduce in <ref> [4] </ref>, we prove that this inclusion relation can be characterized by the Bruhat order of certain symmetric group. <p> The main - 2 - result in this paper is that the Poincare polynomials for cohomology of partition varieties with coefficients in real field R are given by our rook length polynomials introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> with r = m. This paper serves as the transition from the combinatorics of rook placements in [4] to the geometry and topology in our study of partition varieties. <p> - 2 - result in this paper is that the Poincare polynomials for cohomology of partition varieties with coefficients in real field R are given by our rook length polynomials introduced in <ref> [4] </ref> with r = m. This paper serves as the transition from the combinatorics of rook placements in [4] to the geometry and topology in our study of partition varieties. To make this transition smooth for readers starting from both directions, we give basic definitions used in this paper in the next section. <p> Section 6 studies the cell structure of partition varieties. It is shown that partition varieties have CW-complex structure with the rook length polynomials obtained in <ref> [4] </ref> as their Poincare polynomials of cohomology. <p> For example, if = (3; 1), then F = fl fl fl ! Sometimes we write F = : - 3 - We assume, contrary to the usual convention, that F is right justified; the reason for this is explained in <ref> [4] </ref>. If r 1 let -r = i=1 where E i;j is the matrix with 1 at (i; j) and 0's elsewhere. <p> Then, l () = i=1 Definition 2.3 Let RL r (; q) = 2 R r q l () : We call this a rook length polynomial. In <ref> [4] </ref> we proved the following formula. <p> One of the main ideas in <ref> [4] </ref> is to extend a placement of r rooks on an m by n board to a placement P () of m + n r rooks on an m + n r by m + n r board. <p> In Example 2.5, since = E 14 + E 32 : we have c 1 = 1, c 2 = 3, b 1 = 4 and b 2 = 2. Thus fa 1 ; a 2 g = [n] fb 1 ; b 2 g = <ref> [4] </ref> f4; 2g = f1; 3g. So a 1 = 1 and a 2 = 3. <p> in the last 2 rows are a 12;12 = 0; a 12;13 = 0; a 12;14 = 0; a 12;23 = 1; a 12;24 = a 1;4 ; a 12;34 = a 2;4 a 1;4 a 2;3 : Clearly in the lexicographic order of the 2-subsets of column indices in <ref> [4] </ref>, a [2;2];J ( 1 ) = a 2;2 = 1 is the first nonzero 1 by 1 minor. Similarly in the lexicographic order of the 2-subsets of column indices in [4], a [1;2];J ( 2 ) = a 12;23 = 1 is the first nonzero 2 by 2 minor. <p> a 2;4 a 1;4 a 2;3 : Clearly in the lexicographic order of the 2-subsets of column indices in <ref> [4] </ref>, a [2;2];J ( 1 ) = a 2;2 = 1 is the first nonzero 1 by 1 minor. Similarly in the lexicographic order of the 2-subsets of column indices in [4], a [1;2];J ( 2 ) = a 12;23 = 1 is the first nonzero 2 by 2 minor. The next lemma shows that this is not a coincidence.
