Title: SOPHISTICATED VOTING RULES: THE CASE OF TWO TOURNAMENTS  
Author: SANJAY SRIVASTAVA AND MICHAEL A. TRICK 
Date: June, 1993  
Abstract: We characterize when a voting rule defined over two tournaments can be represented by sophisticated voting on a binary tree. This characterization has a particularly simple and intuitive specialization to the case that the two tournaments differ in exactly one place. These characterizations allow us to demonstrate the tree that implements a particular voting rule, and to show the minimality of an example of Moulin that shows that the Copeland rule cannot be implemented on a tree.

Reference-contexts: Miller [6] showed that a specific voting tree, called amendment voting leads to outcomes in the uncovered set 3 of every tournament. Banks <ref> [1] </ref> provided a finer characterization of amendment voting showing that the outcomes lie in a subset of the uncovered set now known as the Banks set. A summary of these and related papers can be found in Moulin [7].

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, we say that f is implemented by the tree. More generally, rule f is a sophisticated voting rule if there exists a voting tree whose outcome at P is f (P ) (see Farquharson <ref> [3] </ref>). Of course, different voting trees can, and will, implement different voting rules. What we seek to discover is the set of sophisticated voting rules. Several papers in the literature have studied properties of sophisticated voting rules.

Reference-contexts: Moulin [7] gives a further restriction on the voting rule, called adjacency, which holds for pairs of preference profiles, and shows that the Copeland winner is not implementable if there are at least eight candidates. Herrero and Srivastava <ref> [4] </ref> show that the top cycle condition is sufficient when the number of candidates is three or less. <p> There, we show how our results can be used to show that implementability across pairs of tournaments is not sufficient for implementation; this disproves a conjecture of Herrero and Srivastava <ref> [4] </ref>, though we are able to refine the conjecture in light of our results. 2. Main Result Let T and T 0 be tournaments defined on a ground set C. We are concerned with voting rules defined over (T; T 0 ). <p> By Theorem 1, this gives us that (x; z) 2 I (T 1 ; T 3 ). This theorem suggests that forcing the implementation of pairwise adjacent tournaments may force additional consistency. This is not true for tournaments that are not adjacent, as the following shows. Herrero and Srivastava <ref> [4] </ref> conjectured that pairwise compatibility is sufficient for 26 SANJAY SRIVASTAVA AND MICHAEL A. TRICK implementing voting rules defined on three or more tournaments provided choices were made from the top cycle. By better understanding the role of decomposability, we can show this conjecture to be false.

Our final application of Theorem 1 shows that Moulin's <ref> [7] </ref> example showing that Copeland's rule is not implementable is essentially minimal for pairwise implementability. In other words, for less than eight candidates, there exists a tiebreaking rule that always picks Copeland winners and which is pairwise implementable. <p> Our characterization is that the top cycle set of B at the two tournaments completely defines the set of non-constant implementable choice functions on T; T 0 . Moulin <ref> [7] </ref> defined a related property called adjacency. For any tournament T , B 16 SANJAY SRIVASTAVA AND MICHAEL A.
