Title: Interactors Reference Manual: Encapsulating Mouse and Keyboard Behaviors

Abstract: This document describes a set of objects which encapsulate mouse and keyboard behaviors. The motivation is to separate the complexities of input device handling from the other parts of the user interface. We have tried to identify some common mouse and keyboard behaviors and implement them in a separate place. There are only a small number of interactor types, but they are parameterized in a way that will support a wide range of different interaction techniques. These interactors form the basis for all interaction in the Garnet system. This research was sponsored by NCCOSC under Contract No. N66001-94-C-6037, Arpa Order No. B326. The views and conclusions contained in this document are those of the authors and should not be interpreted as representing the official policies, either expressed or implied, of NCCOSC or the U.S. Government.

Reference-contexts: You can usually ignore the advanced customization sections. Page 224 Interactors The Main Event Loop Chapter 2 2. The Main Event Loop CMU CommonLisp <ref> [McDonald 87] </ref> supports sending events to the appropriate windows internally. Therefore, under CMU CommonLisp, the interactors begin to run immediately when they are created, and run continuously until they are terminated. While they are running, you can still type commands to the Lisp listener (the read-eval-print loop).

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction This document is the reference manual for the Interactors system, which is part of the Garnet User Interface Development System <ref> [Myers 89a] </ref>. The Interactors module is responsible for handling all of the input from the user. Currently, this includes handling the mouse and keyboard.

Reference-contexts: Interactors are set up to work with the Opal graphics package and the KR object and constraint systems, which are all part of Garnet. The motivation and an overview of the Interactors system is described in more detail in conference papers <ref> [Myers 89b, Myers 90] </ref>. Often, interactors will be included in the definition of Aggregadgets. See the Aggregadgets manual for a description of how this works. 1.1. Advantages of Interactors The design for interactors makes creating graphical interfaces easier.
