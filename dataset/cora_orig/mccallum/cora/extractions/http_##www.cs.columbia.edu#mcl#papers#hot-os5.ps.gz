Title: Intelligent Communication Filtering for Limited Bandwidth Environments  
Author: Bruce Zenel and Dan Duchamp 
Affiliation: Computer Science Department Columbia University  
Abstract: We advocate a new architecture for distributed systems supporting mobility. In this architecture an intermediary is interposed between client and server. Its purpose is to filter or delay all but the most essential data that would travel over the slow link to the mobile host, as instructed by the client. The goal of our work is to provide a general framework to ease the installation and management of application specific filtering mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Our work is novel because of its generality and flexibility: it provides a single, centralized, mechanism for the definition and activation of application specific filters. 2 Design Our design is based on Mach 3.0 <ref> [1] </ref>. We chose Mach in part because we are familiar with it, and in part because it has unique features that are helpful. These features are network-transparent communication ports, an external memory management interface [15], efficient packet filtering [16], and a library implementation of the TCP/IP protocol stack [10].

Reference-contexts: When completed, the mechanism will permit the dynamic installation of "intelligent filters" at the intermediary, and the attachment of such filters to data streams to/from the mobile host. Such an "indirect" approach has been advocated before for dealing with resource-constrained mobile systems <ref> [2, 3, 9, 11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Examples include TCP variants described in <ref> [4, 14] </ref>, the Low Bandwidth X (LBX) protocol [5], and Oracle's planned "Oracle in Motion" product [13]. * Omitting data or reducing interactions. Examples are provided by various statistics gathering programs, such as the rstat protocol used by applications such as perfmeter. <p> The current implementation contains many inefficiencies, not the least of which is using Mach messages as the IPC mechanism between proxy and MH; we plan to replace this path with TCP/IP, which should give much better performance. Results of a more mature implementation of "indirect TCP" in <ref> [4] </ref> suggest that a proxy architecture | even one that passes all data through | does not necessarily introduce massive performance penalties.

Examples are provided by various statistics gathering programs, such as the rstat protocol used by applications such as perfmeter. <p> However, in general, we expect that the filters would embody a significant amount of application specific knowledge, and would have to accumulate state in order to make effective filtering decisions; examples of this type of highly application specific filtering already exist <ref> [5] </ref> or are in the works [13]. A number of advantages derive from filtering data at the intermediary. First, since the communication link between intermediary and mobile host may be slow, reducing the amount of traffic can improve performance. Second, even if data filtering reduces performance it may reduce cost.

When a Mobile Host discovers a Proxy Server, a virtual interface is created, ifconfig'ed to be the mobile host's default route, and the input/output routines of the VIF are associated with the Proxy Server process.

Reference-contexts: Such a host might have extra information about the characteristics of the wireless link. However, there is no constraint on where the Proxy Server may run. Mobile IP <ref> [7] </ref> is an important tool for our work. The mobile host is assigned two "mobile addresses." 1 The first address is a "secret" held between it and the Proxy Server. This address is used for ordinary Mobile IP communication between the Proxy Server and the moving host. <p> See [8] for details. The Proxy Server, in its capacity as an MSR, advertises itself as the reachability point for the 1 According to the address restrictions given in <ref> [7, 8] </ref>. mobile host's public IP address. In this fashion, all packets to the mobile host are routed through the Proxy Server. Note that the Proxy Server is a process; it is not in the operating system.

The next few sections explain the key parts of our mechanism: 1. How to interpose an intermediary between a mobile host and the other endpoint of a "conversation" in a fashion that requires no cooperation, or even awareness, by the other end point. 2. <p> The mobile host's interface to the Proxy Server resides in a library implementation of the TCP/IP stack written at CMU <ref> [10] </ref>. In this "socket library," the entire stack plus a Berkeley socket interface has been moved out of the Unix Server and into the address space of processes. The socket library handles protocol processing and data transfer, but uses the Unix Server to allocate and deallocate TCP/UDP ports.
