Abstract: Fair" Public Key Cryptosystems (FPKCs) have recently been proposed as a method for providing secure escrowing of keys without relying on special purpose hardware. In a fair public key cryptosystem, the cryptosystem users are allowed to choose their own public and private keys, but they must share their secret keys with a group of trustees (escrow agencies) in a manner that allows the trustees to reconstruct the secret key of any user in the event of a court order. The United States Government has recently acquired a license to Fair cryptosystem technology from Silvio Micali. The claimed advantage of the Micali FPKC over alternative approaches to key escrow is that the user in the Micali system is supposedly assured that his or her secret key will remain protected (unless the trustees collaborate to reconstruct the secret key), and the government is supposedly assured that criminals will not be able to abuse the escrow system in a manner that prevents government deciphering of wiretapped communications. In this paper, we expose a serious weakness in the Micali FPKC which allows criminals to abuse the system in precisely the manner

Reference-contexts: Even in Germany, where there is great sensitivity to government monitoring of individuals, the issue of government escrow of secret keys for the purposes of government wiretapping has been under discussion for many years <ref> [1] </ref>. The simplest method of key control is to have a trusted government agency (or agencies) simply escrow the secret key for each individual. Then, in the event of the proper authorization, the government can retrieve the secret key from storage and decipher the intercepted communications of a suspected criminal. <p> In such a system, the government would have the same power that it had before the advent of public key cryptography, and the citizens would have no less privacy than before. (This is essentially the proposal made by Beth <ref> [1] </ref> to the German Parliament in 1990.) As observed by Blakely [2], Shamir [16], and many others, however, it may be cheap to simply store copies of the secret keys, but such a solution can be corrupted.

Reference-contexts: Indeed, when the trustees reveal their shares under a court order (say), the shares may be found to be useless because the criminal user did not provide proper shares of his or her secret key. This 4 problem is partially resolved in <ref> [5] </ref>, where it is shown how shares of a secret can be provided in a way so that each trustee can be assured that he or she has received a valid share of the secret.

Reference-contexts: The method is based on the ability of the criminal to embed a "shadow" public key within the public key that is escrowed in the FPKC <ref> [7] </ref>. Criminals can then communicate using the shadow keys whenever they want to avoid detection by the government. The shadow cryptosystem can be created without any private communication among its users. Moreover, the government has no way of knowing which keys contain shadow keys. <p> The ability of the user to select his own keys allows for a number of simple attacks using subliminal channels. The use of subliminal channels in cryptographic protocols is a well-studied field see <ref> [17, 18, 19, 8, 7, 22] </ref>. We essentially observe that FPKCs fall prey to the same attacks, and give concrete examples of such attacks. <p> This is already enough to encode the public key to Rabin's public-key cryptosystem or to public-key cryptosystems based on discrete logarithms (such as the Diffie-Hellman scheme), using the same security parameter k. As observed by Desmedt <ref> [7] </ref>, an attacker can publish roughly k=2 additional bits in the escrow system by suitably choosing n. <p> If the user has many key pairs (as was discussed in Section 3.5), then there will be enough overall space to embed a secure shadow public key. 11 Several methods have been proposed in the literature for overcoming sub-liminal attacks. Desmedt <ref> [7] </ref>, in particular, has proposed a general method for defending against subliminal attacks in public-key cryptosystems, and our methods have a number of similarities to his approach.

Reference-contexts: be useful in the context of key escrow, it is necessary and sufficient that the pair (m; E (m)) form a (secret key, public key) pair of the public key cryptosystem that is being used. (This is because the secret being shared is the secret key of the user.) Feldman <ref> [9] </ref> and Pedersen [14] describe such VSS methods where E (m) = g m is based on the discrete-log problem. The Feldman and Pedersen VSS schemes can thus be used to share secret keys in the Diffie-Hellman, DSS, El Gamal, and elliptic curve cryptosystems.

Reference-contexts: The current draft of the paper represents the combination of the work of Joe Kilian (who discovered the flaw in the Micali FPKC that is described in Section 3) and Tom Leighton (who invented the Failsafe approach to key escrow that is described in Section 4 <ref> [11] </ref>). The Failsafe approach to key escrow is the subject of a patent filing. 2 Background In a Public Key Cryptosystem, each user is assigned or chooses a matching pair of keys (P; S), where P is the public key corresponding to the pair and S is the secret key.

Reference-contexts: The new method is substantially more secure than the Fair Public-Key Cryptosystem (FPKC) approach advocated by Micali <ref> [13] </ref>. This is because the FPKC approach does not satisfy Properties 2 and 5. <p> The Feldman and Pedersen VSS schemes can thus be used to share secret keys in the Diffie-Hellman, DSS, El Gamal, and elliptic curve cryptosystems. Micali provides some alternative VSS schemes based on discrete logarithms in <ref> [13] </ref>, but these methods are less efficient than the Pedersen scheme. Micali also provides a VSS scheme that can be used to share secret keys in the RSA system. In [13], Micali proposes the Fair Public-Key Cryptosystem approach to key escrow. <p> Micali provides some alternative VSS schemes based on discrete logarithms in <ref> [13] </ref>, but these methods are less efficient than the Pedersen scheme.

(The precise VSS scheme that is used depends on the degree to which the trustees can be trusted to behave properly and the degree to which the users distrust the trustees.) This requires X to send the shares of A to the trustees and it requires the trustees to verify
