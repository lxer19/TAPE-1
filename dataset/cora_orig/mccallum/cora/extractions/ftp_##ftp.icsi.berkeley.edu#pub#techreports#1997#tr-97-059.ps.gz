Abstract: We give the first polynomial time approximability characterization of dense weighted instances of MAX-CUT, and some other dense weighted N P-hard problems in terms of their empirical weight distributions. This gives also the first almost sharp characterization of inapproximability of unweighted 0,1 MAX-BISECTION instances in terms of their density parameter only.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Significant results concerning polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS's) for "dense" instances of several N P-hard problems such as MAX-CUT, MAX-k-SAT, BISECTION, DENSE-k-SUBGRAPH, and others have been obtained recently in Arora, Karger and Karpinski [AKK95], Fernandez de la Vega [FV96], Arora, Frieze and Kaplan <ref> [AFK96] </ref>, Frieze and Kannan [AK97]. Still more recently, the approximability of dense instances of N P-hard problems has been investigated from the point of view of the query complexity.

Still more recently, the approximability of dense instances of N P-hard problems has been investigated from the point of view of the query complexity. <p> In fact, for technical reasons, we start by considering MAX-BISECTION, which is MAX-CUT restricted to cuts with equal sides. (MAX-BISECTION is also called MAX-50/50-CUT or MAX-EQUI-CUT.) Our results extend easily to other MAX-SNP-hard problems such as MAX-2SAT or MAXIMUM ACYCLIC SUBGRAPH. We remark in passing that the methods of <ref> [AKK95] </ref> and [FV96] give a PTAS for MAX-BISECTION. We note that weight problems have been briefly considered in [GGR96] and [AK97]. <p> This concludes the proof of sufficiency of condition (i). The proof of the necessity of condition (ii) again mimics standard arguments. We omit it in this extended abstract. 2 6 5 A PTAS for Dense Weighted Instances of MAX- BISECTION and MAX-CUT In <ref> [AKK95] </ref> and [FV96] the following Theorem was proved. Theorem 2. 0,1 dense MAX-CUT does have a PTAS. The following more general result can be proved in a similar way. Theorem 3. <p> Theorem 3. Assume that the set of instances I has been standardized (i.e. the mean of the weights is 1) and moreover assume that the weights are bounded above by an absolute constant. Then MAX-CUT and MAX-BISECTION on I both have PTASs. The crux of the methods of <ref> [AKK95] </ref> and [FV96] relies on so-called sampling lemmas which work when the dispersion of the weights is of comparable magnitude to that of their means. This is guaranteed by the assumptions of Theorem 3. The following Theorem will be easily deduced from Theorem 3. Theorem 4. <p> This is our first question. A second question is: Does our density definition capture the approximability of all MAX-SNP-hard problems in the weighted case? We know by <ref> [AKK95] </ref> that all these problems are approximable in the dense unweighted case. Acknowledgement We thank Sanjeev Arora, Martin Dyer and Alan Frieze for helpful discussions.

Reference-contexts: The fact that condition (i) implies that the family F is dense, can be established easily by adapting the proof of the law of large numbers in order to get an effective bound on the 5 sample size. Actually, we will adapt a proof of Feller (see <ref> [Fe] </ref>) that he uses to show the convergence of the means of sums of independent r.v.'s to a not necessary constant specified function. The speed of convergence is governed by the function t .

Reference-contexts: Thus, from the fact that MAX-BISECTION (or MAX-CUT) is MAX-SNP hard on 0,1 instances with bounded degree (see Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref>), there is apparently nothing to prove to obtain Theorem 6 where it not because of the apparently innocuous fact that, for each involved d, we are not required to solve MAX-BISECTION on all possible instances of density d, but only for a set of sizes which may be quite thin. <p> MAX-BISECTION is MAX-SNP-hard on any set of graphs H = [ n2N G (n; d n ) where the d n 's satisfy d n 0 for each n 2 N. PROOF The result of Papadimitriou and Yannakakis <ref> [PY91] </ref> quoted in the previous section implies that MAX-BISECTION is MAX-SNP-hard on graphs whose average degree has a 10 fixed upper bound, say D. We shall define an L-reduction from these graphs to graphs in H for a fixed sequence (d n ).
