Reference-contexts: Specifically, the routing message digital signature and sequence numbers are providing authentication and integrity services of routing messages, which compose the first class of communication described above. If these services were available from network <ref> [1] </ref> or transport layer protocols, these mechanisms would no longer be needed in the routing protocols. 23 5.1.1 Routing message sequence number. A sequence number is included in each routing message.

Reference-contexts: In general, shortest path algorithms operate by computing the shortest path spanning tree of a network rooted at the source node. Distance-vector algorithms are based on the Distributed Bellman-Ford (DBF) algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>, in which a node knows the length of the shortest path from each neighbor node to every network destination and uses this information to implicitly compute the shortest-path spanning tree. <p> Each update message contains a vector of one or more entries, each of which specifies, as a minimum, the distance to a given destination. In contrast, link-state algorithms are based on Dijkstra's algorithm <ref> [2] </ref>, where a node must know the entire network topology to compute the shortest path spanning tree. Each node broadcasts update messages, containing the state of each of the node's adjacent links, to every other node in the network.

Reference-contexts: concerning links incident on the remote routers. * Each router is assigned a public-key pair for use in digitally signing routing messages. * Key distribution is based on domain names, and domain names can be efficiently and securely determined given an IP address of a host (for example, Secure DNS <ref> [3] </ref>). 5.1 Routing Message Protection Countermeasures The following countermeasures are effectively implementing security services not available from lower level transport or network protocols. Specifically, the routing message digital signature and sequence numbers are providing authentication and integrity services of routing messages, which compose the first class of communication described above.

Reference-contexts: The modification or fabrication of routing updates allows an intruder to reconfigure the logical routing structure of an internet, potentially resulting in the denial of network service, the disclosure of network traffic, and the inaccurate accounting of network resource usage <ref> [4] </ref>. The replay or deletion of routing updates blocks the evolution of subsets of the logical routing structure (in response to topological or link cost changes), or resets it to an arbitrary earlier configuration with potential results similar to above. <p> This is a reasonably common occurrence caused by mis-configured routers, but it can serve a useful purpose in a hostile attack. Finn describes a subtler version of the black-hole attack <ref> [4] </ref>. This attack is illustrated in Figure 4.1, where an internet with grid topology and unit link cost is shown with three nodes labeled a, c, and v. Each node is labeled with its distance to network v.

Reference-contexts: The sequence of predecessors encountered during such a trace is referred to as the implicit path, or the path extracted from the predecessor network information. The working of algorithms of this type is described by Murthy and Garcia-Luna-Aceves <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. To secure distance-vector protocols the predecessor information defined above is included in each update. <p> The frequency of such changes is dependent on network topology and link change events. However, as has been demonstrated by Garcia-Luna-Aceves and Murthy, efficient path traversal algorithms add minimal overhead <ref> [5] </ref>. Note that hash chain authentication [6] may be usable for the update digital signature, which would decrease the digital signature space cost to 16 octets, and the time cost to an MD5 calculation. Further research is needed into this option.

Reference-contexts: A subverted link is a channel controlled via access to the physical medium (e.g. network cable-plant, the "air-waves", or the electronics used to access them), or via compromise of the protocols underlying the routing protocol in a manner that allows control of the channel (e.g. the TCP session hijacking attack <ref> [7] </ref>). 17 4.2 Threats to Routing Information There are a number of vulnerabilities that allow a strategically placed intruder to fabricate, modify, replay, or delete routing traffic. With these capabilities an intruder can compromise the network in a number of ways.

Reference-contexts: Current distance-vector based routing protocols contain few, if any, mechanisms to provide for the security of their operation, and those that exist are often incomplete. For example, the security mechanisms currently defined for BGP [16] and RIPv2 <ref> [10] </ref> protect the transmission of routing messages across local networks; however, they do not provide integrity or authenticity of the routing information itself as it traverses an internet. These mechanisms require trust of neighbors regarding updates describing the full internet, and transitively, similar trust of all routers in an internet.

Reference-contexts: Interpreting this description for a routing environment, the following general classes of intruders are identified: Masquerading routers: A masquerading router is a node that successfully forges an authorized router's identity. This can be accomplished using the IP spoofing <ref> [11] </ref> or source routing attacks. Subverted routers: A subverted router is one that is caused to violate the routing protocols or to inappropriately claim authority for network resources.

Reference-contexts: These mechanisms require trust of neighbors regarding updates describing the full internet, and transitively, similar trust of all routers in an internet. Solutions to this problem have been proposed (for example, that of Murphy <ref> [12] </ref>) involving the inclusion of full path information 3 and a digital signature of the selected route in the updates. However, such solutions, requiring the validation of nested signatures, have extreme space and time costs that make them unusable in any practical sense. <p> However, such solutions, requiring the validation of nested signatures, have extreme space and time costs that make them unusable in any practical sense. Solutions for securing link-state protocols have been proposed that address both the security of routing message transmission and of the routing information itself <ref> [12, 15] </ref>. While this class of routing protocols has the advantage of a more straightforward means of securing routing information in a manner that effectively limits the scope of trust, it also involves considerable computation and space overhead that compromise its usability in large-scale internets. <p> This is important as routers are potentially vulnerable to attack from a number of sources, with potentially catastrophic results from success. 36 Murphy <ref> [12] </ref> outlines a solution for securing distance-vector protocols that involves including the information used to select a route, signed by the neighbor it received it from, in the routing update it then signs and transmits to its neighbors.

Reference-contexts: And, usurpation is an event that results in control of system services or functions by an unauthorized entity. 8 Security Service: Vulnerabilities and threats are minimized or eliminated through the provision of six security services <ref> [14] </ref>. Confidentiality is the protection of data so it is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. Integrity is the protection of data so that it is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.

Reference-contexts: Subtle manipulation of the routing topology 19 such as this can allow c to set itself up as a conduit for all traffic between v and a region of the internet. Rosen <ref> [17] </ref> documents another vulnerability where corrupted routing packets generated by a node with faulty memory caused the ARPAnet to cease functioning.

Reference-contexts: primary focus of security services in routing protocols is the protection of routing information from threats to the integrity (the intentional corruption of routing data), authenticity (the acceptance of routing information from an unauthorized entity by legitimate routers), and in some cases the confidentiality (of for example sensitive policy information) <ref> [19] </ref> of routing updates. <p> The proposed Internet Security Architecture (ISA) <ref> [19] </ref> provides an architecture for the inclusion of security facilities in the design of protocols to be used in the Internet. Fundamental to the ISA are four concepts: Vulnerability: A weakness in a system's security that may be exploited by an intruder. Threat: A potential violation of security.

Reference-contexts: The countermeasures presented here avoid these problems by signing only the component link information, in the form of predecessors, and performing a path traversal to validate full paths. This results in the use of constant space, and significantly reduced computation time. Smith and Garcia-Luna-Aceves <ref> [20] </ref> have analyzed the Border Gateway Routing Protocol (BGP) in a manner similar to the analysis presented here. BGP is a member of the path-vector class of routing protocols, which carry full path information in the routing updates to allow loop detection, and the use of non-uniform route selection metrics.
