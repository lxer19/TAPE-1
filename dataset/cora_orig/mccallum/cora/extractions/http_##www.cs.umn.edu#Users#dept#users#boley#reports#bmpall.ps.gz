Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel way of model reduction based on matrix pencil theory. Using only orthogonal transformations on state space models, we construct the smallest perturbation to the coefficients that yields a lower order system. We derive some bounds on the stability of the resulting lower order system. We illustrate our method with two examples arising from large flexible space structures.

In section 2, we review the background material on the computation of the nearest distance to a deficient pencil as espoused in [1]. In section 3, we discuss how the ideas in section 2 can be employed in a model reduction. In section 4 we present an algorithm for model reduction and make some remarks on how it can be modified to suit the particular needs of the designer. <p> In section 7, we present some numerical results. Finally, in section 8, we make some concluding remarks. 4 2. Computation of Deficient Pencil In this section we discuss two issues of importance to the reduction scheme as they were espoused in <ref> [1] </ref>. The first one concerns the problem of determining whether a given rectangular pencil is deficient or not. Specifically, given an n x p pencil P (l) = (A lB), with n &gt; p, determine whether or not (A lB) loses rank for any l, including possibly l infinite. <p> Call the corresponding annihilating value l 0 . Furthermore, we have the following: (c) If B has full column rank, then all the annihilating vectors v 0 and corresponding values l 0 are exactly the generalized eigenpairs for the regular part of the pencil. Proof: See <ref> [1] </ref>. The issue of choosing C and D has also been addressed in [1] where two choices were proposed for the selection of C and D. One of these choices is to select C and D as orthonormal basis of the space orthogonal to the columns of A and B. <p> Proof: See <ref> [1] </ref>. The issue of choosing C and D has also been addressed in [1] where two choices were proposed for the selection of C and D. One of these choices is to select C and D as orthonormal basis of the space orthogonal to the columns of A and B. <p> If we denote by s * and s * the minimum in (7) and value of s achieving that minimum, respectively, then E = s * . In <ref> [1] </ref>, it was shown that a simpler scheme which provides both a good estimate for E and for that value of s that yields the minimum in (7) involves solving the eigenvalue problem (5). Let be the generalized eigenvalues and eigenvectors for (5). <p> By taking norms of (10), the following bounds are obtained for the perturbations: E i E i (C l i D)y i / x i . We also have the following error bound from <ref> [1] </ref>. If E denotes that perturbation with the smallest norm yielding a deficient pencil, then E satisfies The importance of this error bound was noted and stated as the following proposition in [1]. (13) i i b 1 min E i min (C l i D)y i . <p> We also have the following error bound from <ref> [1] </ref>. If E denotes that perturbation with the smallest norm yielding a deficient pencil, then E satisfies The importance of this error bound was noted and stated as the following proposition in [1]. (13) i i b 1 min E i min (C l i D)y i . Proposition 2 [Boley]. Let (A lB) be an n x p pencil, with n &gt; p. Let C, D be two arbitrary full-rank n x (n p) matrices. <p> Then the smallest perturbation E such that A + E lB is a deficient pencil satisfies the bound (13), where l i , v i , i = 1, ,n are the eigenpairs of the generalized eigenproblem (5) and y i are defined by (8). Proof. See <ref> [1] </ref>. 7 3. Application to Model Reduction Our goal is to use the results of the previous section to implement a model reduction scheme. This is done by constructing a matrix pencil based on the PBH test for controllability or observability. <p> Suppose we define d i to be the distance to the imaginary axis of the i-th eigenvalue of F, and K i to be the smaller of K and the condition number of the i-th eigenvector of F <ref> [1] </ref>, i.e., If K is replaced by the individual K i and d by the individual d i , then stability of (F + E 1 ) is (51) K i min n with s i w i v i . guaranteed as long as This will yield a slightly tighter

Reference-contexts: In this case, we know that B has full rank. We would like to estimate the size of the perturbation E to the matrix A that is needed to obtain a deficient pencil (A + E lB). In <ref> [2] </ref>, it was shown that the smallest perturbation E can be obtained by solving the minimization problem where s min (M) denotes the smallest singular value of the matrix M, and s varies over the entire (7) min s min (A sB) , complex plane.

Reference-contexts: One can then proceed with the model order reduction of the stable part. We shall also assume that the state space realization described by (2) is minimal. According to the PBH rank test (see e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>), the dynamical system described by eqn. (2) is controllable if and only if the matrix pencil has full rank for any complex value l. <p> Proof: See <ref> [4] </ref> Let E i = e, where e is a finite nonzero value; this can be stated as Thus we must have r 1 / x i e and r 2 / x i e.
