Abstract: Usenet is an example of the potential and problems of the nascent National Information Infrastructure. While Usenet makes an enormous amount of useful information available to its users, the daily data overwhelms any user who tries to read more than a fraction of it. This paper presents a collaboration-oriented approach to knowledge management and evaluation for very large, dynamic database structures such as Usenet. Our approach is implemented in a system called URN, a multi-user, collaborative, hypertextual Usenet reader. Empirical evaluation of this system demonstrates that this collaborative method, coupled with an adaptive interface, improves the overall relevance level of information presented to a user. Finally, the design of this system provides important insights into general collaborative knowledge management mechanisms for very large, dynamically structured database systems such as Usenet and the upcoming Information Superhighway.

Reference-contexts: The global frequency of a keyword is the number of times it appeared in the whole database. By taking the product of the local frequency with the inverse of the global frequency, URN generates higher weights for rare words, and lower weights for more ubiquitous words <ref> [1] </ref>. For each keyword in the badlist, URN computes a weight using the following formula: W b = f l f g 8 where the variables are defined similarly to W g .

Reference-contexts: As of March 1993, an estimated 76,000 Usenet sites existed with a total of over 2.4 million Usenet users [10]. In the two week period from January 10, 1994 to January 24, 1994, users generated over a gigabyte of data, consisting of approximately 673,000 separate articles <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.2 Syntactic Structure of Usenet Usenet articles are categorized into thousands of `newsgroups' (almost 9000 newsgroups exist as of January 24, 1994 [2]). Newsgroup membership is the primary way to classify articles by subject area. Newsgroups are hierarchically named where `.' separates the levels of hierarchy. <p> In the two week period from January 10, 1994 to January 24, 1994, users generated over a gigabyte of data, consisting of approximately 673,000 separate articles <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.2 Syntactic Structure of Usenet Usenet articles are categorized into thousands of `newsgroups' (almost 9000 newsgroups exist as of January 24, 1994 [2]).

Reference-contexts: Because it derives all its information about articles through their header lines, it cannot determine that a thread's contents have changed from the actual Subject line which is a problem ubiquitous to Usenet. 5.4 Tapestry This collaborative document filtering tool <ref> [4] </ref> contains a complex query language (TQL) based on SQL which users can use to write their own queries. Filters written in TQL can access annotations or endorsements created by other users in order to filter a message. <p> Articles can be examined using a Tapestry browser or forwarded via email. As discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>, articles were sent via email and are only prioritized for display in the last step of the Tapestry process using a email client program that does not have access to the full TQL language. 6 Future directions This paper has presented our initial results in designing collaborative classification and evaluation

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Information is rapidly becoming the essential currency of the modern world. With the growth of global connectivity, there is a growing desire to not only receive information, but to distribute one's own information. In the United States, there are proposals for a National Information Infrastructure <ref> [5] </ref> to enable its citizens to participate in the information age. However, there already exists a tremendously successful network allowing millions of people to send and receive information on a global scale. This network is Usenet. Usenet is a global collaborative system par excellence.

Most importantly, Egret provides a dynamic type system that supports incremental creation and modification of the schema-level structure of its underlying database <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Articles are read into the URN database periodically by an agent process via the NNTP protocol <ref> [8] </ref>. As it reads in each article, keywords are extracted from the header of the article. The header fields Subject, Summary, Author, and Keywords from the original article are parsed into separate words.

Reference-contexts: Often when using the system, users wished that they could indicate a stronger preference than the 17 binary interesting or uninteresting provided. Research in psychology suggests that subjects can give meaningful feedback with up to a 7 point rating scale <ref> [9] </ref>, which could easily be implemented in a future version of URN. 5 Related Work Many different programs have been written to read Usenet.

Reference-contexts: Kill files only provide a structure for users to list patterns that exclude everything that they do not like, when it is easier for users to think about patterns that they do like. * Kill files are brittle. Finally, kill files are difficult to create and maintain <ref> [11] </ref>. It is difficult, for example, to know when to take a inappropriate pattern off the list, since the user will not see the interesting articles deleted by the kill file. A final method currently used for information management is the quotation-ratio restriction present in some newsreaders. <p> The author has suggested that users might share their scoring files through some mechanism, which would allow any number of users to moderate a newsgroup. 5.3 INFOSCOPE This newsreading tool allows the creation of virtual newsgroups via filtering <ref> [3, 11] </ref>. Virtual newsgroups are groups of articles selected from multiple newsgroups that match some series of patterns. The filters are generated by background agents that monitor users' activity and display their findings to the user as suggestions. Users can then choose to either accept or reject the filter suggestions.

Reference-contexts: However, even in small like-minded groups, users may have widely varying representations about the structure of a textual artifact <ref> [12] </ref>. In this usage we did not encounter any serious problems, but it must be considered in any longer term experiment. Users expressed a desire to be able to give URN a wider range of feedback on an article.
