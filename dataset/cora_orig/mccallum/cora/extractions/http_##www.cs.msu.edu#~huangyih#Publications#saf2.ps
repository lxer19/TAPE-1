Abstract: In this paper, we continue our previous work on Switch-Aided Flooding (SAF) for use in ATM networks. SAF-based protocols take advantage of hardware-supported cell relay and cell duplication in order to reduce the time needed to disseminate changes in network topology and resource availability. SAF protocols use a spanning multipoint connection (SMC), which is a hardware-switched network spanning tree, but revert to conventional link-by-link flooding when the SMC is unavailable or under construction. The SAF protocol developed here further constructs a virtual ring topology to provide reliability more efficiently than our earlier protocols. The result is a robust flooding protocol that is guaranteed to deliver a broadcast message to all network switches reachable from the source node, and is (complexity-wise) as efficient as unreliable, hardware-based broadcast. The performance of the protocol in the presence of adverse network topology change events is studied via simulation. The results of the simulation reveal that the proposed flooding protocol delivers network updates several times faster than conventional approaches in normal situations, and is still, on average, twice as fast as conventional approaches in presence of component failures. Furthermore, the bandwidth consumed by a flooding operation is also significantly reduced.

The conventional flooding protocol, described in current ATM standards <ref> [1] </ref>, as well as in other LSR protocol standards, works as follows. The source switch sends the LSA to all its neighboring switches. When an LSA is received by another switch for the first time, it is forwarded on all incident links, except the one from which it arrived.

Reference-contexts: However, because cells transmitted on the SMC, as on any ATM connection, are subject to dropping by participating switches, the major challenge in this switch-aided flooding (SAF) approach is to guarantee reliability efficiently. (a) a spanning MC (b) cell forwarding at switch A In an earlier work <ref> [2] </ref>, we introduced two Switch-Aided Flooding (SAF) protocols for ATM networks. SAF-based protocols take advantage of hardware-supported cell relay and cell duplication, characteristic of such networks, in order to reduce the time needed to disseminate changes in network topology and resource availability. <p> Different approaches have been proposed to construct SMCs <ref> [2, 4, 5] </ref>. Further, general-purpose MC protocols could also be used [6]. Here we discuss an approach, called the SMC protocol, that we developed in our earlier work [2]. <p> Different approaches have been proposed to construct SMCs [2, 4, 5]. Further, general-purpose MC protocols could also be used [6]. Here we discuss an approach, called the SMC protocol, that we developed in our earlier work <ref> [2] </ref>. An SMC constructed using this method exhibits the property that, in presence of network component failures that damage the SMC, the SMC does not have to be torn down entirely prior to reconstruction. Rather, fragments of the SMC continue functioning individually, and eventually will merge with one another. <p> Due to space limitations, details of SMC construction, the handling of transient inconsistent core selections, and the detection and repair of broken SMCs, are omitted here. Interested readers may refer to <ref> [2, 8] </ref> for details. 2.3 The Basic SAF Protocol The basic SAF protocol [2] is an extension of the conventional flooding protocol. It works as follows. The source of an LSA broadcasts the LSA on the SMC, and subsequently sends the LSA via all its incident links. <p> Due to space limitations, details of SMC construction, the handling of transient inconsistent core selections, and the detection and repair of broken SMCs, are omitted here.

Several hardware-based implementations of this algorithm are described in [13]. These implementations require that every node maintains in hardware flooding algorithm states for all simultaneous flooding sources. Further, a broadcast message still has to traverse all the communication links.

Reference-contexts: As we will show in Section 5, even while the SMC is fragmented, the ER SAF protocol can still achieve significant performance gain over conventional flooding. The SMC protocol is a variation of the CBT protocol <ref> [7] </ref>, a general MC protocol in which the topology of the MC is the union of shortest paths from the members to a specific node, called the core.

Reference-contexts: O (jV j) acknowledgments will be produced; the total number of links traversed by r acks depends on the total length of ring VCs, denoted as jRj. Various existing heuristics for the traveling salesman problem produce cycles where jRj &lt; C fijV j and C is a constant <ref> [9] </ref>. Using such a heuristic in the construction of the ring, the bandwidth consumed by reliability activities is of complexity O (jV j) (our simulation results presented in Section 5 show that C is typically less than 1.5). <p> Third, every switch, if accepting the LSA, establishes a ring VC to its successor as defined by the LSA. If we define the criterion of the ordering computation to be the minimum total lengths of RVCs, then the switch ordering problem becomes the well-known traveling salesman problem <ref> [9] </ref>. Since the problem is NP-complete, we use the following heuristic [9]: the leader computes a depth-first search tree that spans all reachable switches in its local network image, and uses the ordering determined by the pre-order traversal of the tree. <p> If we define the criterion of the ordering computation to be the minimum total lengths of RVCs, then the switch ordering problem becomes the well-known traveling salesman problem <ref> [9] </ref>.

In the discussion, we assume that the network topol-ogy G = (V; E) is a connected graph, since our concern here is to efficiently flood LSAs to "reachable" nodes.

Reference-contexts: When a switch x receives a switch ordering LSA, it sets up a VC to the succeeding switch defined by the ordering, following the procedures described in ATM UNI 3.1 standard <ref> [11] </ref>. It also accepts a VC-setup request from switch y, where y is the predecessor of x in that ordering. The paths of the two ring VCs are recorded, so that, if subsequent link-down LSAs are received, switch x can detect damage to incident ring VCs.

Networks comprising up to 400 switches were simulated. Since each switch is likely to be attached to several hosts, such networks may include thousands of hosts.
