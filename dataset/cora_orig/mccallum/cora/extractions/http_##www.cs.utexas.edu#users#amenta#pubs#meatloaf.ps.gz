Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we reduce two geometric optimization problems to convex programming: finding the largest axis-aligned box in the intersection of a family of convex sets, and finding the translation and scaling that minimizes the Hausdorff distance between two polytopes. These reductions imply that important cases of these problems can be solved in expected linear time. In the second part of the paper, we use convex programming to give a new, short proof of an interesting Helly-type theorem, first conjectured by Grunbaum and Motzkin.

Reference-contexts: This is already interesting, as an example of a problem which is combinatorially similar to LP although geometri cally the intersection of the constraints fails not only to be convex, but even to be connected. Theorem 0.1 follows by applying an easy theorem from <ref> [A93] </ref>, that there is a Helly-type theorem about the constraint set of every GLP problem. 2 Setup In this section we give some background on convex programming, GLP, and the combinatorial LP algorithms. <p> Note that the Hausdorff distance used in this section can be derived from any metric on E d , not just L 2 . 5 A new proof of an interesting Helly-type theorem In this section we will use an easy but powerful theorem from <ref> [A93] </ref>, which gives us a simple technique for proving Helly-type theorems. Theorem 5.1 Let (H; w) be a GLP problem with combinatorial dimension d. The intersection of H is nonempty if and only if the intersection of every G H with jGj d + 1 is nonempty.

Reference-contexts: Every convex program meets Condition 1, since adding more constraints to a problem can only increase the minimum. It is also well-known that a d-dimensional convex program has combinatorial dimension d; there is a formal proof in <ref> [A93'] </ref>. But notice that it is not the case that every convex program is a GLP problem, since it may fail to satisfy Condition 2. Condition 2 is always satisfied, however, when the minimum of f over the intersection of every subfamily G H is achieved by exactly one point.

The algorithms implied by our reductions are also comparatively simple and implementable. We turn from these practical issues to a theoretical question from combinatorial geometry.

Reference-contexts: The case k = 3 was proved by Larman [L68]. Morris settled the conjecture in his thesis. His proof, however, is quite long (69 pages) and involved, and a better proof has been called for <ref> [E93] </ref>. Using convex programming, we give a short and insightful proof. Our approach is to introduce a function f , and then show that the problem of minimizing f over a family I k d belongs to the class GLP (for Generalized Linear Programming).

Reference-contexts: There are many results on minimizing the Haus-dorff distance between various objects under different groups of motions. Most of them solve more difficult problems and require more time. For planar point sets P; Q, an algorithm of <ref> [HKS91] </ref> finds the translation that minimizes H (P; Q) in O (mn (m + n) lg (mn)) time, where n = jP j; m = jQj.

Reference-contexts: We observe, however, that f is related to the linear function g * (x) = x 1 + *x 2 + * 2 x 3 + : : : + * d1 x d for infinitessimally small *. To make this relationship precise, we adopt the terminology of <ref> [M94] </ref>, and say that an objective function v is a refinement of a function w when, for F; G H, w (G) &gt; w (F ) implies v (G) &gt; v (F ). Let w and v * be the objective functions induced by f and g * , respectively.
