Abstract: We introduce a novel approach for sending messages simultaneously over high and low-speed networks. The new method, called Priority Encoding Transmission, allows a user to specify a different priority on each part the message to be transmitted over a lossy heterogeneous medium. Based on the priorities, the sender uses the system to encode the message into packets for transmission. The system ensures a smooth rate of recovery of the message (in order of priority) by receivers as a function of the received amount of the encoding transmitted. We define the rate of a set of priorities, which is a natural measure of how much information about the message the priorities dictate must be contained in each bit of the encoding. We develop systems for implementing any set of priorities with rate one. We also give an information-theoretic proof that there is no system that can implement a set of priorities with rate greater than one.

Reference-contexts: The probability is over the random choices of the bundles and field elements. Choosing for each code word a bundle and a field element uniformly at random requires a lot of truly random bits. Using the construction of (fl; k)-independent random variables given in <ref> [1, AGHP] </ref>, and using the analysis given in [5, EGLNV], the number of random bits required by the probabilistic erasure codes can be reduced significantly. The details of this method are described in the full paper.

Reference-contexts: Both the message and the code consists of words of 4 length w each. The code has the property that all b words of M can be recovered from any b words of E. Descriptions of erasure codes can be found, for example, in <ref> [3, Berlekamp] </ref> and [9, Rabin]. One implementation of erasure codes is the following. The b words of M are viewed as the coefficients of univariate polynomial of degree b 1 over GF [2 w ]. Call this polynomial G.

Reference-contexts: There are encoding systems which allow recovery of the message from only a subset of the encoding, e.g., forward error correction suggested by [8, McAuley] and empirically evaluated by <ref> [4, Biersack] </ref>. However, these systems allow only one priority level for the entire message. The systems we introduce in this paper can be thought of as extensions of such systems. In this paper, we describe the notion of a Priority Encoding Transmission (PET) system.

Consider ordering the information in the message so that the lowest frequency coefficients come first followed by successively higher frequency coefficients.

Reference-contexts: The encoding/decoding systems are designed to adhere to these priorities, i.e., the system guarantees that a part of the message can be reconstructed depending only on the quantity (determined by the priority of the part), and not the particular subset, of packets received. <ref> [10, Shacham] </ref> also suggests methods for sending prioritized messages over networks. However, those methods require computation of channel capacities from the sender to each receiver, which may be impractical for very large networks with capacities that vary quickly because of congestion. Furthermore, this work does not handle packet losses.
