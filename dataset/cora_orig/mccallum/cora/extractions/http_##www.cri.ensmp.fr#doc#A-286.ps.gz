Abstract: Proposing to the user a nice programming model based on the data-parallel paradigm is one thing. Running the resulting applications very fast is the next issue for a language aiming at high performance on massively parallel machines. This paper discusses the issues involved in HPF compilation and presents optimization techniques, targeting the message-passing SPMD programming model of distributed memory MIMD archi tectures.
