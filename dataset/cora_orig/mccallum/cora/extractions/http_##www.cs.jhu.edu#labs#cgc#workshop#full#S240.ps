Reference-contexts: The reuse of frequencies is possible only if the corresponding level of interference at the cochannel cells does not exceed a given threshold value, which is determined by the quality of signal associated with the employed digital transmission technology <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> . Cellular design involves the choice of locations for the base stations, the determination of the shape and dimensions of the coverage area associated with each base station, and the choice of the frequency to use for communication inside the cell. <p> For those systems, cellular design has been based on hexagonal cells (macrocells) and on simple isotropic propagation models <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> (ideally, the whole plane) is covered by a tessellation of identical cells, and analytical results that give useful insight into and guidelines for the system design can be obtained on the relationships between the required signal quality and the cell radius, reuse distance, number of frequency groups, and system capacity <ref> [1] </ref>. Some of the third generation systems [3] will operate, due to the need for high bandwidth and the saturation of lower-frequency bands, in the millimeterwave frequencies.

Reference-contexts: The choice of the minimum values of C/N and C/I is not unique, giving the designer one degree of freedom which is, to a rough extent, equivalent to a scale factor in the cell sizes and distance between cells <ref> [2] </ref>.

From this area are then removed the parts occupied by buildings. Finally, the points of the resulting area which are visible from the base station are determined (Figure 9). The algorithms for computing the difference of polygons and visibility chains are used.

Reference-contexts: Millimeterwave communication systems present, relative to the systems above, the fundamental difference of propagation occurring mostly in line-of-sight, with negligible diffraction effects and with most building materials being almost totally opaque <ref> [4] </ref>. These systems will make use of a large number of microcells where, in an outdoor environment, the base station transmitters and receivers will be placed at low height, e.g., in lamp posts. <p> Algorithms for other situations can be obtained as variations from the above. These algorithms are reasonably complex and will not be described here. Further details can be found in <ref> [4, 8, 9] </ref>. 4.2 Computation of the Base Station Coverage Area The computation of the area covered by a base station starts with the construction of the area covered as if there were no obstructions.

Symposium on Personal Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications , pp. </booktitle> <pages> 1031-1034, </pages> <address> Toronto, Canada, </address> <month> Sep. </month> <year> 1995. </year>
Reference-contexts: The processing performed by the tool consists of numerical processing, for the computation of propagation-related quantities (signal and interference power levels), and of geometrical operations, for the calculation of the area to be covered by a base station and the computation of interference between cells <ref> [5] </ref>. The latter are implemented by standard computational geometry algorithms for polygon intersection, difference, and visibility. The structure of the paper is as follows. The tool specifications, input and output data are presented in Section 2. In Section 3 the tool functionality and use are described. <p> The shape of this area is the same as the directivity diagram of the base station antenna, and its dimensions are determined by the desired carrier power at the cell boundary <ref> [2, 5] </ref>. From this area are then removed the parts occupied by buildings. Finally, the points of the resulting area which are visible from the base station are determined (Figure 9). The algorithms for computing the difference of polygons and visibility chains are used. <p> O ( n 1 2 3 ), where n 1 is the number of vertices of the polygon which defines the directivity pattern of the base station antenna, n 2 represents the number of vertices of each obstacle polygon, and n 3 the number of polygons considered as potential obstacles <ref> [5] </ref>. The organization of the map polygons in a quadtree allows a large number of polygons to be excluded at the outset from consideration as potential obstacles. <p> Because the quadtree is organized so that the dimensions of the minimum rectangular block, associated with leaf nodes of the lowest level, are of the order of magnitude of a typical urban block of buildings <ref> [5] </ref>, each such a block has a maximum number of 3 or 4 polygons associated, and thus the number of potential obstacles n 3 is bounded by a value four times the number of blocks associated with the directivity pattern of the antenna. F. <p> An area of approximately 2.54 km 2 was covered, of which about 16 %, or .406 km 2 , corresponds to "net" street area. Table 1 summarizes the main resulting parameters <ref> [5, 13] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Given the large number of polygons in a typical application, efficient algorithms and data structures have to be used for adding new polygons and accessing existing ones. Quadtrees are used for this purpose <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Environments " p. 8 The intersection/difference algorithm is standard, and is based on the determination of the points of intersection of the edges of the two polygons and on the classification of the vertices of each polygon with respect to belonging to the interior or exterior of the other one <ref> [7] </ref>. The computation of visibility chains uses as basis a visibility algorithm for the situation where the observation point is interior to the polygon, as in Figure 8 (a). Algorithms for other situations can be obtained as variations from the above.
