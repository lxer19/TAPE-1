Abstract: This is a report on the proceedings of the Distributed System Aspects of Sharing a Virtual Reality workshop at the 6 th WET-ICE Conference held June 18-20, 1997. The workshops discussions focused on the research issues in the field of networked virtual reality, as well as the current methods used to address those issues. In those areas where the state of the art was felt to be lacking, we additionally report on the most promising technologies that the near future holds.
