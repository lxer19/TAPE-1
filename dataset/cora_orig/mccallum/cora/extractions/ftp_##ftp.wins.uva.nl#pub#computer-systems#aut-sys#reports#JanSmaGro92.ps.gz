Reference-contexts: In the realm of pick-and-place problems, we aim at designing highly adaptive controllers which require minimum knowledge of the manipulator and its sensors. In this area, several models have proven successful in one area or another. The use of a single feed-forward network trained with conjugate gradient back-propagation <ref> [1] </ref> gives fast and highly adaptive approximation, but needs up to ten feedback steps to get high-precision results. Kohonen networks [2] give a precision up to 0.5cm. with only two steps, but need thousands of iterations to attain reasonable results. <p> Learning samples are generated by associating the change in camera domain with the change in joint domain. This method, called the input adjustment method <ref> [1] </ref> is reminiscent of a method described in [3]. fl Currently at: Dept. of Physics, The Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana/Champaign, 405 North Mathews, Urbana, Illinois 61801. (b) The reach space in which the robot is tested. (c) Example network for a two-dimensional input space. <p> After training, the summed squared error is chacked for all patterns. If, for some pattern, it exceeds a constant " in some subspace, then the network which represents this pattern is copied to the node for that subspace. The feed-forward networks are trained with conjugate gradient optimisation <ref> [1] </ref>. 3.1.3 Interpolation The now existing tree of nested networks can be used to interpolate for any pattern p hb 0 ;b 1 ;:::;b D1 i in subspace U hb 0 ;b 1 ;:::;b D1 i .
