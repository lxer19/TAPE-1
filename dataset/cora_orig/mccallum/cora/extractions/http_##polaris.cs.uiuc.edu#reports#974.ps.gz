Reference-contexts: We will now present some formal definitions of the commands. 3 The Commands We here present the syntax and semantics of the various simulation-control commands. The syntax is defined using the YACC notation <ref> [1] </ref>, while the semantics are explained in natural language. 3 definition: path syntax: path : identifier arrayrestr | path "." identifier arrayrestr ; arrayrestr : "(" integer ")" | "(" integer ":" integer ")" | empty ; semantics: A path specifies a set of elements from the described digital systems.
