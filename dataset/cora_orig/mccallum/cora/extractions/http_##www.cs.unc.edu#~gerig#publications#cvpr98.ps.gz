Abstract: This paper presents a new technique for the automatic model-based segmentation of 3-D objects from volumetric image data. The development closely follows the seminal work of Cootes et al. [5] but presents various new solutions to come up with a true 3-D technique rather than a slice-by-slice 2-D processing. The segmentation system includes both the building of statistical models and the automatic segmentation of new image data sets via a restricted elastic deformation of models. Geometric models are derived from a sample set of image data which have been segmented by experts. The surfaces of these binary objects are converted into a parametric surface net which is normalized to get an invariant object-centered coordinate system. Surface descriptions are expanded into series of spherical harmonics which provide parametric representations of object shapes. Gray-level information is represented by 1-D profiles normal to the surface. The alignment is based on the well-accepted stereotactic coordinate system since the driving application is the segmentation of brain objects. Shape statistics are calculated from the parametric shape representations rather than from the spatial coordinates of sets of points. After initializing the mean shape in a new data set on the basis of the alignment coordinates, the model elastically deforms in accordance to displacement forces across the surface but is restricted only by shape deformation constraints. The technique has been applied to segment left and right hippocampal structures from a large series of 3-D magnetic resonance scans taken from a schizophrenia study.

Reference-contexts: In this previous paper the feasibility of a 3-D extension of this method has already been investigated. We have demonstrated that based on a general surface parametrization scheme <ref> [2] </ref> the concept can be generalized for 3-D organ surfaces with spherical topology using spherical harmonics as shape descriptors. <p> This is done using a uniform parametrization of closed surfaces and by calculating an invariant object centered description (Brechbuhler et al. <ref> [1, 2] </ref>). The alignement of parametrized object surfaces approximates a correspondence of surface points. <p> Figure 1a illustrates the result of an expert segmentation of the left hippocampus. 3.2 Surface parametrization The surface of a closed voxel object is most often stored as a mesh based on vertices having three spatial coordinates, although presenting two degrees of freedom. Brechb uhler et al. <ref> [2] </ref> developed a surface parametrization of arbitrary simply connected objects based on those two parameters. The embedding of a convoluted object surface in the surface of the unit sphere of the parameter space was formulated as a constrained non-linear optimization problem. <p> Further, objects of similar shape produce very similar parameter nets (up to a rotation in parameter space; see below) due to the uniqueness of the solution and robustness of the iterative optimization <ref> [2] </ref>. 3.3 Spherical harmonic shape descriptors The parametization gives us three explicit functions defining the object surface as x (q; f) = (x (q; f); y (q; f); z (q; f)). This surface description is used to expand a 3-D shape into a complete set of spherical harmonics. <p> The series takes the form x (q; f) = l m=l l Y m The coefficients c m l are three-dimensional vectors with com ponents c x m m m l with degree l and order m. A detailed description can be found in Brechbuhler et al. <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The necessity of obtaining high reproducibility and the need to increase efficiency motivates the development of computer-assisted, automated procedures. Elastically deformable contour and surface models, so-called snakes [8], have been proposed as tools for supporting manual object delineation. While such procedures can be extended to 3-D <ref> [24, 3] </ref>, their initialization is a critical issue. Most often, the initial guess must be very close to the sought contour to guarantee a satisfying result [14]. An excellent overview of elastically deformable models can be found in [11].

Reference-contexts: Methods using modal analysis have been successfully applied to medical image analysis by Sclaroff and Pentland [17] and Nastar and Ay-ache [13], for example. Cootes et al. <ref> [5] </ref> combined the power of parametric de-formable shape descriptors with statistical modal analysis. They use active shape models, which restrict the possible deformations using the statistics of training samples. <p> The generation of the statistical model will be discussed in detail in the following section. The purely geometrical statistical model proposed in our earlier paper [21] has been extended by incorporating gray-valued profiles across the organ surface, implementing the concept proposed by Cootes and Taylor <ref> [5, 6] </ref> to the third dimension. The matching process is initialized using the average geometrical model resulting from this training phase. <p> Each data set is transformed into canonical coordinates by 3-D rotation and scaling. 3.5 Shape statistics After transformation to canonical coordinates, the object descriptors are related to the same reference system and can be directly compared. An established procedure for describing a class of objects follows <ref> [5] </ref>, where the calculation are used for object space normalization carried out in the domain of shape descriptors rather than the Cartesian coordinates of points in object space. <p> c j from the mean shape using weights in eigenvector space, and are given below (dotted line) and the components of one typical vector b j . ... and reconstructed from their descriptors. 3.6 Modeling the gray level environment of sur face models Following the work of Cootes et al. <ref> [5, 6] </ref> we augment the geometric shape models by incorporating information about the gray level environment of the model surface. We examine the statistics of the image intensity along 1-D profiles orthogonal to the object surface at a discrete set of sampling points. <p> This is an important advantage since 3-D snake and balloon techniques are known to be prone to elastically deform to any smooth object shape. Our approach has been significantly influenced by the research work of Cootes, Taylor et al. <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. <p> Small translations and rotations of objects with respect to this coordinate system are part of the statistical model. Therefore, we do not separate a similarity transform for alignment and an elastic transform for remaining shape deformations as in <ref> [5] </ref>. <p> Similar to the experience of Cootes et al. <ref> [5] </ref> we too found that the modelling of gray level information near the object boundaries provides valuable additional information for a model placement and improves the robustness and stability of the optimization scheme. An early version of our segmentation [21] used an energy minimization concept similar to standard snake techniques.
