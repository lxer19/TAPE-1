Abstract: We address the problem of determining the minimal resources necessary to satisfy a specified Quality of Service (QoS) measure using dynamic techniques. A key advantage of these techniques is that very little traffic characterization information is needed from the user. Specifically, we study the performance of a dynamic control algorithm which determines the minimum bandwidth needed to satisfy a specified average cell loss probability requirement for a given source. The emphasis of this study is to examine practical implementation issues for such techniques including transient behavior, dependence on system parameters such as buffer sizes and source burstiness as well as algorithm parameters such as measurement intervals.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Networks supporting multimedia traffic are expected to satisfy certain Quality-of-service (QoS) performance measures for each user. Additionally, efficient use of network resources is desired for providing a cost-effective service. Typical QoS measures include average cell loss probability (CLP) and cell transfer delay (CTD) <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]. Network resources of interest include bandwidth requirements at each physical link, as well as buffer space and processing capability at each switching node. A major issue for the network service provider is how to satisfy the specified QoS requirements using the network resources as efficiently as possible. <p> The conventional approach for dealing with this problem is to have each user declare in advance the characteristics of their traffic using a few traffic parameters <ref> [1] </ref>. The amount of resources to be reserved, to satisfy the desired QoS, is then calculated using these parameters.

The ser-vice rate over the nth update interval, denoted n , is assumed to be constant. All cells require the same processing time. <p> Figure 7 shows the behavior as a function of varying initial update interval.

The main contribution here is to examine the transient and dynamic behavior of one such technique for providing efficient resource allocation under QoS constraints, study its robustness under different conditions and quantify its convergence for multimedia traffic models. <p> Hsu and Walrand [7] independently investigated dynamic bandwidth allocation under similar assumptions to our work. However, no experimental study of the performance of the algorithm was conducted. Our emphasis on the other hand, has been on the practical aspects of such techniques <ref> [9] </ref>. 2 Description of the Algorithm 2.1 Queuing Model and Definitions The algorithm studied here, dynamically adjusts the instantaneous service rate (t) of a finite buffer queue in order to meet a specified QoS performance measure Q (In this paper this is the average cell loss probability, defined below. <p> Use of REQS for statistical delay type QoS was also examined <ref> [9] </ref>). Observations of the queuing behavior are used by a control algorithm to adjust the service rate of the queue. Let B be the (fixed) buffer size of the system. <p> This is formally proved in <ref> [9] </ref>. Based on this result, the algorithm for calculating the rate in the n + 1st interval is given in equation 1. n+1 = n + K n ln (P n =Q l ) (1) Here, ln () is the natural logarithm function. <p> Pseudo-code for the algorithm to vary the algorithm parameters is listed in Figure 1. Details on the motivation for the formulation in Eqn 1 and the algorithm in Figure 1 are presented in <ref> [9] </ref>. 3 Numerical Results Due to the intractability of analysis of transient behavior of queues with bursty traffic, we used simula tion to analyze the performance of REQS. 3.1 Simulation Model and Procedure A two-state Markov Modulated Bernoulli Process (MMBP) was used as the traffic source in most experiments. <p> The convergence time was defined to be the time required to arrive at and stay within 5% of the steady state rate. The method of batch means was used to determine convergence time. Additional details on the simulation procedure are in <ref> [9] </ref>. /* K 0 , K 1 , U 0 and Q l assumed to be given */ /* initial values: inc flag = TRUE, mode = 1 */ curr error log (P n =Q l ); prev error log (P n1 =Q l ); if (mode = 1) f U <p> This indicates the robustness of the algorithm to the choice of the measurement interval. Additional interesting simulation results on the relation between the update interval and the relaxation time of the queue and tradeoffs between short and long update intervals are reported in <ref> [9] </ref>. Figure 3 shows sample path results of the instantaneous rate for four values of U 0 (B = 80 only). Although we do not provide a formal proof of convergence, data like this strongly supports our assertion that the algorithm converges. <p> In general convergence time increased with increase in source burstiness, buffer size and queue utilization. Since these three factors are not independent, interesting non-monotonic behavior of the convergence time was observed when two parameters were varied simultaneously <ref> [9] </ref>. The results observed were consistent with the anlytical results on relaxation time of the M=M=1=K queue as predicted in [8]. 3.4 Variation of Convergence Time with CLP Requirement time with the QoS value itself. Clearly the convergence time rises sharply as the loss requirements become more stringent. <p> However, for sources with non-exponentially distributed states the formulas can become inaccurate. In <ref> [9] </ref>, we present cases in which these formulas overestimate the bandwidth requirements by as much as 75% over the true minimum requirement determined by REQS. 0 1 2 3 10 -5 10 -3 10 -1 Current CLP over time B 80, UI .5 Time (seconds) CLP x 10 4 10 -4 <p> In <ref> [9] </ref>, we demonstrate that such techniques are not feasible for controlling both the QoS obtained and the steady state rate as is achieved by the use of REQS. 5 Summary This paper has studied an algorithm for determining the minimum resource requirements needed to guarantee a specified Quality of Service measure.
