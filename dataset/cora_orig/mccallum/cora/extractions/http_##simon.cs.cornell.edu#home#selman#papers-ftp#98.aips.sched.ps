Abstract: We study the runtime profiles of complete backtrack-style search methods applied to hard scheduling problems. Such search methods often exhibit a large variability in performance due to the non-standard nature of their underlying cost distributions. The distributions generally exhibit very long tails or "heavy tails" and are best characterized by a general class of distributions that have no moments (i.e., an infinite mean, variance, etc.). We show how one can exploit the special nature of such distributions to significantly improve upon deterministic complete search procedures.

Reference-contexts: Our next goal is to further enhance the performance of our CSP based approach. To do so, we consider adding a stochastic element to our backtrack-style search. In previous work, in the context of a highly structured search domain based on algebraic structures <ref> (Gomes et al. 1997) </ref>, we found that randomized versions 1 Experiments ran on a Sun UltraSparc using CPLEX, a leading commercial integer programming package. 2 Experiments ran on a 200MHz SGI Challenge using ILOG SOLVER, a prominent constraint programming package.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that recently there has been a lot of interest in this sports timetabling problem (McAloon et al. 1997). Since the submission of this paper, a lot of progress has been made in terms of solving larger instances <ref> ( McAloon et al. 1998) </ref>. By using multiple threads on a 14 processor Sun system, 26 and 28 teams schedules were generated, which is the record as of this writing (Wetzel and Zabatta, in preparation). We believe these numbers can be improved upon with our randomization technique.
