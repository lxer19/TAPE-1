Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are applied to the problems of statistical modeling, database searching and multiple sequence alignment of protein families and protein domains. These methods are demonstrated on the globin family, the protein kinase catalytic domain, and the EF-hand calcium binding motif. In each case the parameters of an HMM are estimated from a training set of unaligned sequences. After the HMM is built, it is used to obtain a multiple alignment of all the training sequences. It is also used to search the SWISS-PROT 22 database for other sequences that are members of the given protein family, or contain the given domain. The HMM produces multiple alignments of good quality that agree closely with the alignments produced by programs that incorporate three-dimensional structural information. When employed in discrimination tests (by examining how closely the sequences in a database fit the globin, kinase and EF-hand HMMs), the HMM is able to distinguish members of these families from non-members with a high degree of accuracy. Both the HMM and PRO-FILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences) perform better in these tests than PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins). The HMM appears to have a slight advantage

Reference-contexts: It is basically a steepest-descent-type algorithm that climbs the nearest peak (local maximum) of the likelihood function (or the posterior probability in MAP estimation). Since finding the globally optimal model seems to be a difficult optimization problem in general <ref> (Abe & Warmuth, 1990) </ref>, we have experimented with various heuristic methods to improve the performance of the method. Probably the best method is to give the model a hint if something is already known about the sequences, which is often the case.

Reference-contexts: Since this normalizing constant is independent of the model, MAP estimation is equivalent to maximizing Prob (sequencesjmodel)Prob (model): (5) over all possible models. The MAP approach is closely related to minimum description length (Jurka & Milosavljevic, 1991) and minimum message length <ref> (Allison et al., 1992) </ref> methods. There is no known efficient way to directly calculate the best HMM model either in the ML or MAP sense.

Reference-contexts: We recently found that Asai, Hayamizu and Onizuka have applied HMMs to the problem of predicting the secondary structure of proteins, obtaining prediction rates that are competitive with previous methods in some cases <ref> (Asai, K. and Hayamizu, S. and Onizuka, K., 1993) </ref>. In addition, Tanaka, Ishikawa, Asai, and Konagaya also discuss the relationship between the HMM method for obtaining multiple alignments and previous methods (Tanaka et al., 1993).

Reference-contexts: Similarly, if an HMM is built for a protein domain or motif, then it can be used to search for occurrences of this domain or motif in the database, much like a PROSITE expression <ref> (Bairoch, 1992) </ref>, a commonly used method for searching for patterns found in protein sequences. <p> A list of potential protein kinases was created from the union of sequences designated as being kinases from four independent sources: our HMM, PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins <ref> (Bairoch, 1992) </ref>), PROFILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences (Gribskov et al., 1990)) and a keyword search. Two regions of the catalytic domain of eucaryotic protein kinases have been used to build PROSITE signature patterns.

Reference-contexts: In the case of globins, whose structure contains principally ff-helices, the 150 or so helical positions have been named A1, A2, ..., A16, B1, ... etc., where the letter denotes the ff-helix, and the number indicates the location within that ff-helix (see for example <ref> (Bashford et al., 1987) </ref>). <p> In contrast, generating multiple alignments with HMMs requires no prior knowledge of underlying structure.

Here we only give a brief description of our approach. <p> The mathematical details are described in <ref> (Brown et al., 1993) </ref>. <p> We are currently exploring the use of a prior on the probability distribution over the amino acids in a match state of the model consisting of a mixture of Dirichlet priors <ref> (Brown et al., 1993) </ref>. This prior is derived in a manner analogous to that described in Section 2.8. Using such a prior is like "soft-tying" the distributions in the states of the HMM.

Reference-contexts: We are not the first group to employ hidden Markov models in computational biology. Lander and Green (1987) used hidden Markov models in the construction of genetic linkage maps. Other work employed HMMs to distinguish coding from non-coding regions in DNA <ref> (Churchill, 1989) </ref>. Later, simple HMMs were used in conjunction with the EM algorithm to model certain protein-binding sites in DNA (Lawrence & Reilly, 1990; Cardon & Stormo, 1992) and, more recently, to model the N-caps and C-caps of alpha helices in proteins (D. Morris, unpublished).

Reference-contexts: The most common one is the Baum-Welch or forward-backward algorithm (Rabiner, 1989; Lawrence & Reilly, 1990), which is a version of the general EM method often used in statistics <ref> (Dempster et al., 1977) </ref>. The process of the EM algorithm can be viewed as an iterative adaptation of the model to fit the training sequences. The steps in this process can be summarized as follows. 1. <p> the quality of the current model (as measured by (3) or (5)) increases in each iteration, and no model is arbitrarily good, the process eventually terminates and produces a model that is, at least locally, the best model for the training sequences to within some specified precision of the parameters <ref> (Dempster et al., 1977) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: than correcting for the bias introduced by a limited training set. 3 Results 3.1 Globin experiments The modeling was first tested on the globins, a large family of heme-containing proteins involved in the storage and transport of oxygen that have different oligomeric states and overall architecture (for a review see <ref> (Dickerson & Geis, 1983) </ref>). Hemoglobins are tetramers composed of two ff chains and two other subunits (usually fi, fl, ffi or ). Myoglobin is a single chain, some insect globins are present as dimers and some intracellular invertebrate globins occur in large complexes of many subunits.

Reference-contexts: These guanylyl cyclases contain a single transmembrane domain, a cyclase catalytic domain and an intracellular protein kinase-like domain in which protein kinase activity has not been seen to date (reviewed in <ref> (Garbers, 1992) </ref>). Although these sequences are not kinases in terms of function, they possess all the conserved subdomains except for subdomain I (the nucleotide binding loop) and the majority of conserved residues present in "certain kinases" (see "Subdomain" of Figure 11A and positions indicated by "*"). <p> An invariant Asp in subdomain VIb (Asp 166 in (Knighton et al., 1991)) that is proposed to be the catalytic base is known to diverge in guanylyl cyclases (28-34, 36-37) even though the immediate region is highly conserved <ref> (Garbers, 1992) </ref>. Our results indicate that other invariant residues appear to be replaced as well.

Reference-contexts: If, for instance, an alignment of some of the sequences is available, it is straightforward to translate that into a model by simply calculating the relative frequency of the amino acids and the transition frequencies in each position, as in the profile method <ref> (Gribskov et al., 1990) </ref>. It is of course even more interesting if the model can be found from a tabula rasa, i.e., using no knowledge about the sequences. <p> A list of potential protein kinases was created from the union of sequences designated as being kinases from four independent sources: our HMM, PROSITE (a dictionary of sites and patterns in proteins (Bairoch, 1992)), PROFILESEARCH (a technique used to search for relationships between a protein sequence and multiply aligned sequences <ref> (Gribskov et al., 1990) </ref>) and a keyword search. Two regions of the catalytic domain of eucaryotic protein kinases have been used to build PROSITE signature patterns. The first pattern corresponds to an area believed to be involved in ATP binding (PROSITE entry PROTEIN KINASE ATP, sequence motif [LIV]G.G.[FYM][SG].V). <p> Since PROSITE expressions do not allow for flexible gapping or insertions, a profile of kinases was constructed from an alignment of seven kinases and employed for database discrimination tests (M. Gribskov, personal communication) using the program PROFILESEARCH <ref> (Gribskov et al., 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: to build a statistical model of a family of whole proteins like globins, but instead to build a model of a structural motif or domain that occurs as a subsequence in many different kinds of proteins, such as the EF-hand motif (Nakayama et al., 1992) or the kinase catalytic domain <ref> (Hanks & Quinn, 1991) </ref>. Here we expect our model to only match a relatively small subsequence of any given protein, with many other unmatched amino acids appearing before and after this subsequence.

Reference-contexts: The data was then filtered to remove all sequences with any unknown residues (353) and all sequences having length less than 200 (4230), since complete protein kinase catalytic domains range from 250 to 300 residues <ref> (Hanks et al., 1988) </ref>. This filtering removed a total of 4386 sequences. A scatter plot of NLL-score versus length for the SWISS-PROT sequences in given in Figure 9. A cutoff of 6.0 was chosen because there are no sequences with Z-scores between 4.935 and 6.773.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, to avoid having 20 additional free parameters for each insertion state, we simply set the amino acid distributions in the insert states to be uniform distributions, i.e., each amino acid has probability 1/20. In our previous work we have used the global frequencies of the amino acids <ref> (Haussler et al., 1993) </ref>. We have found that it usually makes little difference which one is used, but the uniform distributions tend to improve the performance of the models when searching databases. <p> This is because the EM procedure is not guaranteed to find the globally optimal model for a given training set. In other experiments, reported in <ref> (Haussler et al., 1993) </ref>, we trained an HMM for globins beginning with a model derived from the Bashford et al. alignment, and obtained a slightly lower NLL-score than any model from our experiments using EM on unaligned training sequences (208 compared to 210.3).

Reference-contexts: There are many kinds of interactions in proteins that are not easily modeled by HMMs, for example, pairwise correlations between amino acid distributions in positions that are widely separated in the primary sequence, but close in the three-dimensional structure (see e.g. <ref> (Klinger & Brutlag, 1993) </ref>). It would be very valuable to have more general models that incorporate such interactions while still remaining computationally tractable.

Reference-contexts: We consider the globins, whole proteins ranging in length from 130 to 170 residues (with few exceptions) and two domains, the protein kinase catalytic domain (250-300 residues) and the EF-hand calcium-binding motif (29 residues). The same approach can be used to model families of nucleic acid sequences as well <ref> (Krogh et al., 1993) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Only enzymes in the first two categories have been well characterized and recent developments indicate that some can phosphorylate both alcohol (serine/threonine) and phenol (tyrosine) groups, the so called dual-specificity protein kinases <ref> (Lindberg et al., 1992) </ref>. It is the region comprising the catalytic domain of these hydroxyamino acid phosphorylating enzymes that we model by an HMM and which we subsequently refer to as protein kinases or simply kinases.

Reference-contexts: There are many cases when one does not want to build a statistical model of a family of whole proteins like globins, but instead to build a model of a structural motif or domain that occurs as a subsequence in many different kinds of proteins, such as the EF-hand motif <ref> (Nakayama et al., 1992) </ref> or the kinase catalytic domain (Hanks & Quinn, 1991). Here we expect our model to only match a relatively small subsequence of any given protein, with many other unmatched amino acids appearing before and after this subsequence. <p> The functional and or structural consequences of these modifications on any kinase activity are not clear. 3.3 EF-hand experiments For these experiments we used the June 1992 database of EF-hand sequences maintained by Kretsinger and co-workers <ref> (Nakayama et al., 1992) </ref>. Sequences in this database are proteins containing two or more copies of the EF-hand motif, a 29-residue structure present in cytosolic calcium-modulated proteins (Nakayama et al., 1992; Persechini et al., 1989; Moncrief et al., 1990). <p> This problem arises partly because of the absence of a pronounced gap in the histogram of Z-scores and the resultant uncertainty in assigning an exact cutoff (cf Figures 10 and 12). The mnemonic developed to identify EF-hand homologues and distinguish them from analogues <ref> (Nakayama et al., 1992) </ref> (see Ca-binding in Figure 13A) is 26 known to generate errors and is unable to detect 8 of the 27 sequences known to be EF--hands (sequences 1-27 in Figure 13).

Reference-contexts: In this manner, the individual components evolve during training to represent clusters in the training sequences. This way of using EM is called mixture modeling in the statistics literature (Duda & Hart, 1973; Everitt & Hand, 1981), and is known as `(soft) competitive learning' in the neural network literature <ref> (Nowlan, 1990) </ref>. When the model is trained, the probability of a sequence given any of the submod-els can be calculated, i.e., the probability that the sequence belongs to the corresponding cluster/subclass. The negative logarithm of this probability corresponds to the NLL-score calculated for a simple HMM.

Reference-contexts: a combination of the idea of tying states, see e.g. (Rabiner, 1989), in which the number of free parameters is reduced by having groups of states all share the same distribution on the output alphabet (the 20 amino acids in this case), and the idea of soft weight sharing from <ref> (Nowlan & Hinton, 1992) </ref>, in which the regularizer (in this case the prior for the distribution of amino acids) is also adaptively modified during learning. We have shown that this method can be used to estimate good EF-hand models using substantially fewer training sequences.

Reference-contexts: The same approach can be used to model families of nucleic acid sequences as well (Krogh et al., 1993). A hidden Markov Model <ref> (Rabiner, 1989) </ref> describes a series of observations by a "hidden" stochastic process | a Markov process. In speech recognition, where HMMs have been used extensively, the observations are sounds forming a word, and a model is one that by its "hidden" random process generates these sounds with high probability. <p> The forward part of the forward-backward procedure can also be used to efficiently compute log Prob (sequencejmodel), the negative logarithm of the probability of a sequence given the model (as defined in (2)), without summing over all possible paths for the sequence <ref> (Rabiner, 1989) </ref>. We call this the negative log likelihood (NLL)-score of the sequence. The average NLL-score of a training sequence is inversely related to the likelihood of the model, given by (3), and hence serves as a numerical measure of progress for each iteration of the EM procedure. <p> In addition, with a simple extension to the algorithm, the most probable path itself can be found using the usual backtracking technique <ref> (Rabiner, 1989) </ref>. <p> This prior is derived in a manner analogous to that described in Section 2.8. Using such a prior is like "soft-tying" the distributions in the states of the HMM. By "soft-tying" we mean a combination of the idea of tying states, see e.g. <ref> (Rabiner, 1989) </ref>, in which the number of free parameters is reduced by having groups of states all share the same distribution on the output alphabet (the 20 amino acids in this case), and the idea of soft weight sharing from (Nowlan & Hinton, 1992), in which the regularizer (in this case

Reference-contexts: It would be very valuable to have more general models that incorporate such interactions while still remaining computationally tractable. We are currently exploring the potential of one model class of this type to capture the base-pairing in RNA families <ref> (Sakakibara et al., 1993) </ref>, and hope eventually to incorporate some of the features of these models into our protein models. Finally, we are encouraged by the quality of the multiple sequence alignments generated by the HMMs and the accuracy of the database searches.

Reference-contexts: We plan to explore these as well. It is interesting to note that we have obtained quite good results in multiple alignment and database searching without using any special weighting schemes to make up for the statistical bias in our training sets (see e.g. <ref> (Sibbald & Argos, 1990) </ref>), or employing Dayhoff's matrix or any of its analogs (see e.g. (Waterman, 1989)) to take explicit mutation probabilities between amino acids into account. It also remains to be seen whether or not incorporating any of these extensions into the HMM approach will yield even better results.

Reference-contexts: The 3 alignments produced by these methods often depend strongly on the particular values of the parameters required by the method, in particular the gap penalties <ref> (Vingron & Argos, 1991) </ref>. Furthermore, a given set of sequences is likely to possess both fairly conserved regions and highly variable regions, yet conventional global methods assign identical penalties for all regions of the sequences.

Reference-contexts: log Prob (s; pathjmodel)g = min paths N+1 X [ log T (q i jq i1 ) log P (x l (i) jq i )]: This distance from a sequence to a model is analogous to the standard "edit distance" from one sequence to another (with gap penalties), see e.g. <ref> (Waterman, 1989) </ref>, but is perhaps more related to the distance from a sequence to a profile. The term log P (x l (i) jq i ) represents a penalty for aligning the amino acid x l (i) to the position represented by state q i in the model. <p> One approach to this problem is to alter the dynamic programming method used to align a sequence to a model so that it tries all possible ways of aligning each subsequence of the sequence to a model <ref> (Waterman, 1989) </ref>. We use a simpler (but almost equivalent) method in which only the HMM model is altered, so that the same standard procedures (forward-backward and Viterbi) which we use for models of whole proteins can be used without modification for models of domains. <p> interesting to note that we have obtained quite good results in multiple alignment and database searching without using any special weighting schemes to make up for the statistical bias in our training sets (see e.g. (Sibbald & Argos, 1990)), or employing Dayhoff's matrix or any of its analogs (see e.g. <ref> (Waterman, 1989) </ref>) to take explicit mutation probabilities between amino acids into account.
