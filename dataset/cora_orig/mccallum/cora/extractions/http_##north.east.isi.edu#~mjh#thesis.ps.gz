Reference-contexts: AN ANALYSIS OF MBONE PERFORMANCE Layered encodings <ref> [1] </ref> have been suggested as one solution to this problem of heterogeneity, and indeed show great promise as a mechanism to allow different data rates to be delivered to different receivers depending on available resources.

Reference-contexts: A shortest path scheme delivers data from a sender to each receiver along the shortest path from the sender to that receiver 2 . If several sources send simultaneously, each of them may use a different tree as illustrated in figure 3.1. CBT <ref> [2] </ref> is an example of shared tree multicast routing scheme, as illustrated in figure 3.2. Shared tree algorithms build a single tree that is used by traffic from all senders 3 .

Reference-contexts: More applicable to synchronous conferencing systems are techniques from the area of operational transformation [21]<ref> [3] </ref>. In Grove [21] concurrency control is achieved by transforming operations that arrive out of date based on local context so that they can be executed without disrupting the session. In GroupDesign [3], a simpler model is used which is more similar to that used in NTE.

Reference-contexts: If this data is extrapolated, it shows that multicast applications that attempt to adjust so that no receiver is suffering significant loss will almost inevitably adjust so that they send no data (or whatever their minimum data rate is configured to). Thus adaptation schemes such as <ref> [4] </ref> are unlikely to be useful in the wide area Mbone as we see it today. 4.3.5 Consecutive Losses The graphs in figure 4.9 (A-C) show the frequency of RTP sequence number increments as observed at UCL on each of several days. <p> This process is illustrated in figure 5.3. 5.4. INCONSISTENCY AVOIDANCE MECHANISMS 79 This is loosely based on a scheme devised by Wakeman <ref> [4] </ref> for congestion control in multicast based adaptive video.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately this extra gain comes at the expense of extra delay in the case of this audio coding scheme so may or may not be worthwhile depending on the purpose of the stream itself. Whilst these results agree with the conclusions of Bolot <ref> [5] </ref>, the two-stage Gilbert model used only provides a first order approximation to these results. Figure 4.9b also shows output from a two-state Gilbert model (figure 4.10, p=0.083, q=0.823).

Reference-contexts: Two other studies <ref> [7] </ref>[74] of this area have been performed. The work of Bolot et al [7] studies temporally correlated loss in fixed bit-rate audio streams, and finds results which are in general agreement with this study. Yajnik et al [74] study both spatial and temporal loss correlation by using dedicated monitoring software at 17 sites.

Reference-contexts: However, in reviewing requirements for future networks, Clark and Tennenhouse <ref> [10] </ref> identified problems with such a layered approach for new classes of application including audio and video transmission. They argue that the traditional concept of presentation and transport layers which provide a reliable abstraction over an unreliable network is inappropriate for many of these new protocols.

Reference-contexts: With packet-switched networks themselves, IP multicast has been the most significant extension to the internet architecture. 1 The internet was not designed to handle real-time traffic, although the first experiments carrying audio were as early as 1973 <ref> [11] </ref>, and there have been several attempts to modify the architecture to better handle streaming data. The trend here has been away from complex 1 TCP Congestion Control is probably the most significant extension to internet protocols, but doesn't change the architecture itself. 23 24 CHAPTER 2.

Reference-contexts: Different tools choose not to satisfy one of these goals. * LBL's shared whiteboard, wb, is the only multicast based distributed data application in widescale use. It does not allow different users to be able to manipulate the same object. * Dissemination applications such as web page multicast <ref> [12] </ref> or Usenet news feeds [54] only have one data source per group, and so avoid this conflict. * Traditional distributed applications make use of locking, and suffer performance problems as a result.

Reference-contexts: Inconsistency Discovery Unlike the mechanisms used in SRM [24] and INRIA's whiteboard <ref> [13] </ref>, inconsistencies due to simple packet loss cannot be discovered simply from a gap in the packet sequence number space as we wish most such changes to be repaired by redundancy, and therefore do not need to see a copy of every packet at a receiver.

Reference-contexts: In particular it is impossible to configure overlapping scope regions as shown in figure 3.3, and there are a number of other problems with TTL scoping, and so more recently, administrative scoping has been added to the multicast forwarding code in mrouted <ref> [16] </ref> and in most router implementations. Administrative scoping allows the configuration of a boundary by specifying a range of multicast addresses that will not be forwarded across that boundary in either direction. 3.4.

Reference-contexts: monitor this information as current RTP based tools do not report jitter correctly. 4.2 Data Collection Three programs were written to collect data on which the following examination is based: * An RTP logger, which logs data packet arrivals at a receiver. 1 IGMP is the Internet Group Management Protocol <ref> [17] </ref>. Mwatch uses IGMP to obtain the set of multicast neighbours of an mrouter 4.2.

Reference-contexts: Multicast routing schemes can be loosely divided into those that provide shortest path trees and those that provide shared trees. 3.3. MULTICAST ROUTING 41 DVMRP [15],MOSPF [61] and Dense-mode PIM <ref> [19] </ref> are examples of shortest path multicast routing schemes. A shortest path scheme delivers data from a sender to each receiver along the shortest path from the sender to that receiver 2 .

Reference-contexts: This provides redundant backbone links which can be exploited to form source-based shortest path trees to simulate DVMRP and sparse and dense mode PIM. The resulting graph is very similar to those generated by Doar <ref> [20] </ref> and has a hierarchical structure, with a variable number of multiple paths that together make this class of simulations a reasonable model of the real internet.

Reference-contexts: More applicable to synchronous conferencing systems are techniques from the area of operational transformation <ref> [21] </ref>[3]. In Grove [21] concurrency control is achieved by transforming operations that arrive out of date based on local context so that they can be executed without disrupting the session. In GroupDesign [3], a simpler model is used which is more similar to that used in NTE.

Reference-contexts: Shared tree algorithms build a single tree that is used by traffic from all senders 3 . Typically this is done by using the shortest path tree to a single router (known as the Core or Rendezvous-Point) to build the tree. Sparse-mode PIM <ref> [22] </ref> is an example of a hybrid scheme.

Reference-contexts: Multicast routes and (multicast) link loss statistics can be collected with mtrace <ref> [23] </ref>, and with the wide-scale deployment of RTP based conferencing systems, the tools themselves report limited loss statistics using RTCP. Both mtrace and RTCP only provide loss averages, rather than information about individual packet losses.

Reference-contexts: Most current RMPs tend to rely on retransmission of missing packets, and the primary difference between such RMPs is in the mechanisms for scalably deciding who can report loss, and who can perform the retransmission. For example, SRM <ref> [24] </ref> is based around both timer and probabilistic delay of NACKs, then multicasting NACKS which serve to suppress duplicate retransmission requests. <p> In such situations the majority of packets will be NACKed and retransmitted at least once. In the vanilla SRM described in <ref> [24] </ref> all NACKs and retransmissions are sent to all receivers, and this may result in very significant retransmission overhead. In [25] the possibility of local recovery mechanisms is discussed. <p> Often sessions would be left active for days at a time, and the whiteboard would accumulate comments helping people catch up if they missed a particular discussion. Unfortunately the LBL whiteboard, wb <ref> [24] </ref>, was proving to be inadequate for the task for three reasons: * It did not cope well with the higher loss rates seen in Europe. * It was not possible for one participant to manipulate another's input, and so the chair could not correct or incorporate written contributions. * A <p> Inconsistency Discovery Unlike the mechanisms used in SRM <ref> [24] </ref> and INRIA's whiteboard [13], inconsistencies due to simple packet loss cannot be discovered simply from a gap in the packet sequence number space as we wish most such changes to be repaired by redundancy, and therefore do not need to see a copy of every packet at a receiver. <p> If this a message is a retransmission request, it should also be multicast, as then the reception of the request can be used at other sites to suppress their retransmission requests. SRM <ref> [24] </ref> uses a mechanism by which retransmission requests are delayed by a random period of time partially dependent on the round-trip time between the receiver and the original source. Requests are then multicast and serve to suppress further duplicate requests from other sites. <p> If no other site responds before this time interval elapses, then a site sends. To investigate how long this delay should be, we simulated such a generic multicast request-response protocol. Similar mechanisms are used in SRM <ref> [24] </ref> but in the address allocation case the group is likely to be larger, the delay matrix unknown, and even the size of the receivership unknown.

Reference-contexts: In such situations the majority of packets will be NACKed and retransmitted at least once. In the vanilla SRM described in [24] all NACKs and retransmissions are sent to all receivers, and this may result in very significant retransmission overhead. In <ref> [25] </ref> the possibility of local recovery mechanisms is discussed. These show promise to help this situation in the case of a small number of particularly congested links by dynamically discovering significant loss points and performing local retransmission across the lossy link to the downstream receivers.

Reference-contexts: Thus for such real-time adaptive streams, it appears that we need support from router forwarding engines such as would be provided by RED <ref> [26] </ref> and a fair queuing scheme [33][64] before we can design even receiver driven multicast congestion control mechanisms that will accurately sense appropriate network bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Such period loss patterns are likely to result from a periodic effect in the network itself. In the past, Van Jacobson has attributed similar effects to a bug in certain routers, where they invalidate their interface routing cache while processing routing updates, and to synchronisation of routing updates <ref> [27] </ref>. Although these seem likely there is not enough data in these RTP or RTCP figures to verify either hypothesis.

Reference-contexts: Dynamic prefix allocation (and especially garbage collection) is hard with contiguous masks, but is somewhat simpler with discontiguous masks, and so a Kampai <ref> [29] </ref> style scheme would be preferable. Such a hierarchical scheme would associate discontiguous prefixes with regions of the network, and this can also greatly help the scalability of multicast routing.

Reference-contexts: In general, the majority of CSCW work has centered around preventing inconsistencies from arising. We believe that allowing and accommodating temporary inconsistencies is required to achieve good performance. Some work does explicitly allow inconsistencies in the area of so-called asynchronous collaboration. Haake and Haake <ref> [34] </ref> use a versioning system to manage parallel versions, but do not concentrate on subsequent re-synchronisation.

Reference-contexts: The design of the CMMC is discussed in <ref> [35] </ref>, although the details are not relevant here. A subset of this functionality was later standardised in H.320/H.323 gateways. <p> In the case of a shared text editor, these network constraints may conflict with user requirements when assessing design goals. 5.0.4 Intended Usage Scenarios The requirement for a scalable shared text editor emerged in 1993 from the MICE project <ref> [35] </ref>. The twelve partner organisations were scattered throughout eight countries, and to manage the project we held weekly meetings using multicast based conferencing. Typically such a session would involve twenty to thirty participants using audio, video and a shared whiteboard.

Reference-contexts: There is no concept of shared tools, although a raw bit-pipe is available within the serial-line framing protocol.

CAR also used ISDN channels, but used one channel for audio/video data and the second ISDN channel for IP data.
