Abstract: A distinction between two forms of task knowledge transfer, representational and functional, is reviewed followed by a discussion of MTL, a modified version of the multiple task learning (MTL) neural network method of functional transfer. The MTL method employs a separate learning rate, k , for each task output node k. k varies as a function of a measure of relatedness, R k , between the kth task and the primary task of interest. An MTL network is applied to a diagnostic domain of four levels of coronary artery disease. Results of experiments demonstrate the ability of MTL to develop a predictive model for one level of disease which has superior diagnostic ability over models produced by either single task learning or standard multiple task learning.

We conclude with a discussion of the results and plans for future work. 2 2 Background 2.1 Representational vs. functional transfer In <ref> [31] </ref> the difference between two forms of task knowledge transfer is defined: representational and functional. The representational form of transfer involves the direct or indirect assignment of known task representation (weight values) to a new task. <p> Thus, the initial assumption under this version of MTL is that all parallel tasks are very closely related to the primary task. The method and the simulator have been previously applied to a controlled laboratory task domain <ref> [31] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: use of implicit pressures from supplemental training examples [1, 33], the parallel learning of related tasks constrained to use a common internal representation [6, 9], or the use of historical training information (most commonly the learning rate or gradient of the error surface) to augment the standard weight update equations <ref> [20, 23, 34] </ref>. These pressures serve to reduce the effective hypothesis space in which the learning system performs its search. This form of transfer has its greatest value from the perspective of increased generalization performance.

Reference-contexts: A survey of medical and bio-medical journals since 1989 produced over 700 articles on the application of neural networks in biomedical research and clinical diagnosis (for examples see <ref> [2, 3, 7, 10, 12, 24, 35] </ref>). Most closely related to the experimental data used in this paper are those articles which involved diagnostic medical images of the heart muscle [4, 5, 11, 16]. Medical diagnosis is particularly in need of inductive systems capable of domain knowledge consolidation and transfer.

Reference-contexts: We consider this to be an explicit form of knowledge transfer from a source task to a target task. Since 1990 numerous authors have discussed methods of representational transfer <ref> [15, 25, 26, 28, 29, 32, 36] </ref> which often results in substantially reduced training time with no loss in generalization performance. In contrast to representational transfer is a form we define as functional.

Reference-contexts: Medical diagnosis is particularly in need of inductive systems capable of domain knowledge consolidation and transfer. The complexity of disease diagnosis often prevents current computational theories of pure inductive learning from ensuring that the trained models can be relied upon. The Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) theory <ref> [37] </ref> dictates that a large number of training examples (ie. the sample complexity) is required by a learning system in order for it to develop a highly accurate model of a complex function.

It has been used for various purposes by other authors such as <ref> [18, 22, 38] </ref>. 5 should be based on some measure of the relatedness of each task to the primary task of interest.
