Abstract: This paper describes a method to automatically acquire the syntactic and semantic classifications of unknown words. Our method reduces the search space of the lexical acquisition problem by utilizing both the left and the right context of the unknown word. Link Grammar provides a convenient framework in which to implement our method.

Reference-contexts: While they have considerable success in specific domains it is difficult to port such systems to new domains without requiring extensive manual customization for the new domain. Explanation Based Learning has been applied to lexical acquisition <ref> (Asker et al. 1992) </ref>. A large corpus of text is divided into sentences with unknown words and those without. Those without are parsed and their parse trees form a knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: IRI-9212074. for expressing bidirectional constraints. Among the other frameworks we have investigated were Depen dency Grammar (Me lcuk 1988), Categorial Grammar (Oehrle et al. 1988), and Word Grammar <ref> (Hudson 1984) </ref> all of which are lexically-based. We selected Link Grammar due to its explicit use of right and left context and the availability of an implementation that includes a 24,000 word lexicon. However, our approach is applicable to any system that integrates bidirectional constraints explicitly in the lexicon.

Reference-contexts: Link Grammar is not the only way to process grammars bidirectionally. In fact, there is no reason why a more traditional context free grammar could not be processed bidirectionally <ref> (Satta and Stock 1994) </ref>. An implementation is under way to extend the parser of Link Grammar to automatically acquire the syntax and semantics of unknown words. It seems that the disjuncts of each word are a special kind of feature structure.

Reference-contexts: If all words are known in a sentence, it is valid only if the associated constraints have a solution. Otherwise, constraints are inferred for unknown words that will make the sentence valid.

We describe the process of acquiring the syntax of unknown words and outline the process of semantic acquisition. We close with a discussion of related work and our plans for the future. Link Grammar Link Grammar <ref> (Sleator and Temperley 1991) </ref> is a context-free linguistic framework that is lexically based. It differs from other context-free grammars in that there are no decomposable constituent structures and its grammar rules are implicit in the lexicon.
