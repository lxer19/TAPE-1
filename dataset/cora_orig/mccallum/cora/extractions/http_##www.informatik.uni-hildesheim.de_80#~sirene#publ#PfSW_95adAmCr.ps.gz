Title: How to Break Another Provably Secure Payment System presented a protocol for untraceable electronic cash
Author: Stefano DAmiano and Giovanni Di Crescenzo 
Note: At Eurocrypt 94,  
Abstract: We show that this protocol nevertheless does not provide any untraceability and has some further weaknesses. We also break another provably secure system proposed by Di Crescenzo at CIAC 94. This is the second case of problems with provably secure payment systems. Moreover, yet another system with this name tacitly solves a much weaker problem than the seminal paper by Chaum, Fiat, and Naor and most other practical papers in this field (de Santis and Persiano, STACS 92). We therefore identify some principal problems with definitions and proofs of such schemes, and sketch better ways to handle them.
