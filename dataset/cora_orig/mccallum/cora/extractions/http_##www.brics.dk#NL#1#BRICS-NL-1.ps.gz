Its purpose is to inform you of appointments, publications, courses and other activities within BRICS. Further details can be obtained by contacting the addresses below. First a word about the research centre BRICS: BRICS Activities  In particular, there will be a workshop in the 3rd week of August with a limited number of participants. As a lead-in to the workshop, it is planned in the previous week to have some introductory seminars aimed at PhD students and others who are not experts in complexity theory.  
Abstract: BRICS, a Centre for Basic Research in Computer Science, is funded by the Danish National Research Foundation for the period 19941998. Its aim is to establish in Denmark important areas of basic research in the mathematical foundations of Computer Science, notably Algorithmics and Mathematical Logic, alongside existing activities in Semantics of Computation. The Cen-tre is based at the Department of Computer Science, University of Aarhus, in association with the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Aalborg University. The research plan is based on a commitment to fulfil the aims, using a combination of long-term efforts and a number of short-term, intensive programmes, within carefully chosen scientific themes.
