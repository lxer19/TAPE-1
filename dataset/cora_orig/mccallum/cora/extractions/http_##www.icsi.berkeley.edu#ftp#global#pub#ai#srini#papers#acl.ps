Title: EXPLOITING CONDITIONAL INDEPENDENCE IN PROBABILISTIC MODELS OF LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING Summary  
Keyword: Subject Areas: sentence processing, psychological modeling, probabilistic models. Word Count: 3194  
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a method to build probabilistic models of language understanding by systematically exploring interdependencies between multiple linguistic features. Our method reifies conditional independence assertions implicit in sign-based linguistic theories and describes the joint distribution of interrelated features compactly without requiring additional assumptions about modularity. With this approach, we are able to model a wide array of psycholinguistic results on lexical access and the access of idioms, and to explain some processing difficulties in syntactic disambiguation.

Reference-contexts: We suggest that using conditional probabilities, rather than relative frequencies explains the similarity neighborhood effects found by <ref> (Luce et al. 1990) </ref> and others. Furthermore, we suggest that a probabilistic account may explain the often-noticed fact that top-down effects on access are very commonly found in psycholinguistic studies in phonology, but are much rarer in syntax. 1.1. <p> The discriminating power of the evidence is low for cases where highly probable words or constructions begin the idiom because they provide evidence for so many other constructions as well. This means few constructions will be pruned. Next, the probabilistic model explains the similarity neighborhood effects found by <ref> (Luce et al. 1990) </ref> and others. Luce et al. showed that words differ in their similarity neighborhoods, the set of words which resemble them phonetically.

Reference-contexts: Evidence can come from syntactic, semantic, and phonetic sources, both top-down and bottom-up. Words are accessed if they fall within a certain percentage of the most highly-ranked word. This threshold confidence ratio is a universal constant in the grammar. In concert with recent sign-based linguistic theories such as HPSG <ref> (Pollard and Sag 1994) </ref>, Construction Grammar (Fillmore 1988; Fillmore et al. 1988), Cognitive Grammar (Langacker 1987), and other unification-based theories (Sag et al. 1985), we assume that the accessed construction is the site for common correlations and constraints between conceptual and perceptual sources of linguistic knowledge.
