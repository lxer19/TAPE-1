Reference-contexts: Therefore, the area of clinical information systems has become one of our key applications. In October 1994, after several years of experience with a Common Lisp implementation of the K-Rep description logic system <ref> [ Mays et al., 1991 ] </ref> , we embarked upon a substantial redesign effort to accomplish the following objectives: Scalability: K-Rep must support extremely large knowledge bases, potentially beyond the limits of virtual storage.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents an overview of K-Rep's system architecture, which has been motivated in part by the needs of several applications in the area of clinical information systems <ref> [ Mays et al., 1996 ] </ref> . <p> concurrent, distributed development of terminologies include: * Conflict detection and resolution * Distribution of approved terms * Update of local versions Of course, subsumption and related inferences are extremely useful for conflict detection and reporting. 3 Conclusion Bringing K-Rep to the point of around-the-clock production use at Kaiser-Permanente in Colorado <ref> [ Mays et al., 1996 ] </ref> has been a non-trivial endeavor. Other projects are underway at the inter-regional level of Kaiser-Permanente, Barnes Jewish and Christian Hospital, Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, the Mayo Clinic, and Stanford University.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction K-Rep is an object-oriented knowledge representation system based on description logic <ref> [ Woods and Schmolze, 1992 ] </ref> . K-Rep provides a language to express descriptions (e.g., of medical concepts such as drugs, treatments, and diseases), inference mechanisms for reasoning about descriptions and their relationship to one another, and considerable supporting infrastructure.
