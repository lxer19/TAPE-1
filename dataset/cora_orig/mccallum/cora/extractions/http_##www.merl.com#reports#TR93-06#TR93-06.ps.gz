Abstract: It is well-known that the FDDI guarantees a bounded access delay and an average bandwidth for synchronous traffic. However, this fact alone cannot effectively support many real-time applications that require the timely delivery of each critical message. We solve this problem by developing a synchronous bandwidth allocation (SBA) scheme which calculates the synchronous bandwidth necessary for each application to satisfy its message-delivery delay requirement. The result obtained in this paper is complementary to the SBA protocol in the FDDI station management standard SMT 7.2, and is essential for effective use of the FDDI's capacity of supporting synchronous traffic.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a proposed ANSI standard for a 100 Mbps token ring network using a fiber-optic medium <ref> [1, 2, 3, 4] </ref>. Thanks to its high transmission speed, the FDDI alleviates the bandwidth saturation problem of the current 10 Mbps Ethernet and the 4 or 16 Mbps IEEE 802.5 Token Rings. <p> question: "if allocation of a synchronous bandwidth equal to the peak traffic rate still cannot satisfy the requested delay bound, how much of synchronous bandwidth should we allocate for a given application? " The station management standard 1 SMT 7.2 of the FDDI describes a synchronous bandwidth allocation (SBA) protocol <ref> [4] </ref>, which specifies how synchronous bandwidth is allocated to a node, but it does not indicate how much of synchronous bandwidth needs to be assigned for a specific application. Clearly, the FDDI's capacity of supporting synchronous traffic cannot be effectively used without a proper SBA scheme. <p> Violation of this constraint would make the ring unstable and oscillate between "claiming" and "operational" <ref> [4] </ref>. Under this protocol constraint, a well-known fact about the FDDI is that the worst-case token rotation time is bounded by 2 fi T T RT , and the average token rotation time is bounded by TTRT [8].

Reference-contexts: Clearly, the FDDI's capacity of supporting synchronous traffic cannot be effectively used without a proper SBA scheme. Agrawal et al. <ref> [5] </ref> proposed a normalized proportional SBA scheme which has the following features and/or problems. 1. The scheme can be used for applications where the requested message-delay bound d always equals the message generation period T . <p> Use of a global SBA scheme also complicates the SBA protocol, making it difficult to implement. As an improvement of the scheme in <ref> [5] </ref>, Chen et al. proposed an optimal SBA scheme in a recent paper [6]. However, it still suffers the limitation of d = T and is a global scheme. <p> A more general result was obtained by Agrawal et al. in a recent paper <ref> [5] </ref> as stated below. Lemma 2.1 . <p> The following lemma gives a lower bound of time that node i is allowed to transmit its synchronous packets during a time period t <ref> [5] </ref>. Lemma 2.2 . Under the protocol constraint (1) of the FDDI, node i has at least bt=T T RT 1c h i units of time to transmit its synchronous packets during a time period t. <p> We derive in this section the conditions for establishing real-time channels over an FDDI network. From these conditions, a new SBA scheme will be developed which has many advantages over the SBA schemes of <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. Let (t) denote the time that a node in the worst-case is allowed to transmit its synchronous packets during a time period t. Lemma 2.2 gives a lower bound of (t) for node i. We improve Lemma 2.2 by calculating the exact value of (t) as follows. <p> Users should try their best to avoid using small delay bounds. However, this is not always possible for interactive video applications and/or in cases where video frames have to traverse several LANs to reach their destinations. Compared with the SBA schemes of <ref> [5] </ref> and [6], Algorithm 3.1 has the following advantages. Generality: The SBA schemes of [5, 6] can establish real-time channels with d = T only, while Algorithm 3.1 can establish channels of arbitrary parameters, i.e., d T or d &gt; T . <p> However, this is not always possible for interactive video applications and/or in cases where video frames have to traverse several LANs to reach their destinations. Compared with the SBA schemes of [5] and [6], Algorithm 3.1 has the following advantages. Generality: The SBA schemes of <ref> [5, 6] </ref> can establish real-time channels with d = T only, while Algorithm 3.1 can establish channels of arbitrary parameters, i.e., d T or d &gt; T . <p> Real-time channels with d &gt; T are also useful for multimedia applications. Thus restricting d = T would greatly limit a network's ability and effectiveness of supporting real-time communications. 8 Optimality: The SBA scheme of <ref> [5] </ref> is not optimal, even under the restrictive assumption d = T . Thus a real-time channel establishment request may be rejected even if it can be established using another scheme. The SBA scheme of [6] is optimal under the restrictive assumption of d = T and requires complex computations. <p> The SBA scheme of [6] is optimal under the restrictive assumption of d = T and requires complex computations. By contrast, Algorithm 3.1 is optimal for d T + T T RT (which subsumes the special case d = T of <ref> [5, 6] </ref>) as well as for some other cases when the exact value of ff n can be calculated (see Algorithm 3.2), because it is based on the necessary and sufficient conditions of Theorem 3.1, and the computation of the optimal bandwidths is simple and straightforward. <p> Rejection of a channel establishment request by Algorithm 3.1 means the violation of the necessary conditions, implying that the channel cannot be established with any other scheme. Simplicity: The SBA schemes of <ref> [5, 6] </ref> are global schemes in the sense that the addition/removal of a channel or change of the parameters of a channel would require adjustment of the high-priority token holding times of all nodes in the network. This requires a complex SBA protocol. <p> This requires a complex SBA protocol. By contrast, Algorithm 3.1 needs only local parameter adjustment, thereby making it far easier to implement than those in <ref> [5, 6] </ref>. Algorithm 3.1 can also be used for real-time channels with a common source node. Specifically, if two channels t 1 and t 2 have the same source node s, and t 1 requires h s = t 1 and t 2 requires h s = t 2 . <p> In other words, no other SBA scheme can guarantee the establishment of a set of real-time channels with utilization &gt; U w = =3. Agrawal et al. <ref> [5] </ref> proved that their normalized proportional SBA scheme has a worst-case achievable utilization of 33% when d i = T i . Thus, their scheme, albeit not optimal, reaches the highest worst-case achievable utilization when d i = T i .

As an improvement of the scheme in [5], Chen et al. proposed an optimal SBA scheme in a recent paper <ref> [6] </ref>. However, it still suffers the limitation of d = T and is a global scheme. Besides, it uses an iterative algorithm for the calculation of the optimal bandwidths which may, in theory, need an infinite number of steps to converge. <p> We derive in this section the conditions for establishing real-time channels over an FDDI network.
