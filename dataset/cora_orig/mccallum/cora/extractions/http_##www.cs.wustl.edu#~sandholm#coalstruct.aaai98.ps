Abstract: Coalition formation is a key topic in multiagent systems. One would prefer a coalition structure that maximizes the sum of the values of the coalitions, but often the number of coalition structures is too large to allow exhaustive search for the optimal one. But then, can the coalition structure found via a partial search be guaranteed to be within a bound from optimum? We show that none of the previous coalition structure generation algorithms can establish any bound because they search fewer nodes than a threshold that we show necessary for establishing a bound. We present an algorithm that establishes a tight bound within this minimal amount of search, and show that any other algorithm would have to search strictly more. The fraction of nodes needed to be searched approaches zero as the number of agents grows. If additional time remains, our anytime algorithm searches further, and establishes a progressively lower tight bound. Surprisingly, just searching one more node drops the bound in half. As desired, our algorithm lowers the bound rapidly early on, and exhibits diminishing returns to computation. It also drastically outperforms its obvious contenders. Finally, we show how to distribute the desired search across self-interested manipulative agents.

Reference-contexts: This is because, according to those solution concepts, an agent can justifiably claim more than others receive from V (CS) by objecting to CS (both to the structure and to the payoff distribution). A justified objection (as defined classically e.g. in <ref> (Kahan & Rapoport 1984) </ref>) depends on all possible CSs. Thus it uses information beyond the region of the search space that any nonexhaustive algorithm should search. The protocol designer cannot prohibit access to information that may support such objection because the agents can locally decide what to search.

Reference-contexts: This section reviews some of the work that has. (Deb, Weber, & Winter 1996) bound the maximal number of payoff configurations that must be searched to guarantee stability. Unlike our work, they neither address a bound on solution quality nor provide methods for coalition structure generation. <ref> (Ketchpel 1994) </ref> presents a coalition formation method which addresses coalition structure generation as well as payoff distribution. These are handled simultaneously. His algorithm uses cubic time in the number of agents, but guarantees neither a bound from optimum nor stability of the coalition structure.

Reference-contexts: Then, they could repeatedly search more and more as time allows, again using the distributed method. 9 The randomization can be done without a trusted third party by using a distributed nonmanipulable protocol for randomly permuting agents (Zlotkin & Rosenschein 1994). Distributed randomization is also discussed in <ref> (Linial 1992) </ref>. 10 See (Mas-Colell, Whinston, & Green 1995) for a definition of Nash equilibrium. 11 Agent j will try to trade off the cost of search against the risk of getting caught, and could decide that the risk is worth taking.

Reference-contexts: Negative externalities can also be caused by conflicting goals. In satisfying their goals, nonmembers may actually move the world further from the coalition's goal state (s) <ref> (Rosenschein & Zlotkin 1994) </ref>. Positive externalities are often caused by partially overlapping goals. In satisfying their goals, non-members may actually move the world closer to the coalition's goal state (s). From there the coalition can reach its goals less expensively than it could have without the actions of nonmembers. <p> For example, the agents could first do step 1 of Algorithm 1.

There is no mechanism for motivating self-interested agents to follow his algorithm. <ref> (Shehory & Kraus 1996) </ref> analyze coalition formation among self-interested agents with perfect information in CFGs. Their protocol guarantees that if agents follow it (nothing necessarily motivates them to do so), a certain stability criterion (K-stability) is met.
