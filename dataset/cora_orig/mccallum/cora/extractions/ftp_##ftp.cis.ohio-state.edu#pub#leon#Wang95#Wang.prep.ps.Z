Abstract: Auditory scene analysis is critical for complex auditory processing. We study auditory segregation from the neural network perspective, and develop a framework for primitive auditory scene analysis. The architecture is a laterally coupled two-dimensional network of relaxation oscillators with a global inhibitor. One dimension represents time and another one represents frequency. We show that this architecture, plus systematic delay lines, can in real time group auditory features into a stream by phase synchrony and segregate different streams by desynchronization. The network demonstrates a set of psychological phenomena regarding primitive auditory scene analysis, including dependency on frequency proximity and the rate of presentation, sequential capturing, and competition among different perceptual organizations. We offer a neurocomputational theory - shifting synchronization theory for explaining how auditory segregation might be achieved in the brain, and the psychological phenomenon of stream segregation. Possible extensions of the model are discussed.

Reference-contexts: The simulation results in Figs. 12 and 13 resemble those of the corresponding psychological experiments (Bregman & Pinker, 1978; Bregman, 1990). Different from stream segregation, these simulations of sequential capturing used tones with time overlaps. As shown in the results, unlike other models of auditory segregation <ref> (e.g. Beauvois & Meddis, 1991) </ref>, our model handles simultaneous tones equally well as sequential tones.

Reference-contexts: The models by Neti and Young (1992) and by Zakarauskas and Cynader (1993) use such spectral cues to compute the spatial location of sound. All these models concern localizing only a single sound, though the auditory system can identify multiple locations simultaneously <ref> (Blauert, 1983) </ref>. It is not clear how the algorithms may be extended to deal with multiple simultaneous sounds, the very problem facing auditory segregation.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION A listener in a realistic auditory environment is always exposed to acoustic energy from many different sources. In order to recognize and understand the auditory environment, the listener must first disentangle the acoustic wave and capture each event. This process is referred to as auditory scene analysis <ref> (Bregman, 1990) </ref>, or auditory segregation. Its task is to separate the sensory features of an auditory scene into multiple coherent streams, each having a high likelihood of coming from the same source. A stream in the auditory domain roughly corresponds to an object in the visual domain. <p> Auditory segregation, which is potentially a parallel process, should be a precursor to successive separation. Auditory segregation can be divided into primitive auditory segregation and memory-based auditory segregation <ref> (Bregman, 1990) </ref>. Primitive auditory segregation is an innate process, relying on the similarities of local qualities within the input scene itself, such as frequency, timing, or amplitude. Memory-based auditory segregation is based on prior knowledge stored in memory to segregate the auditory input. <p> Auditory segregation could be obtained with as little as a 15% difference in frequency and could be obtained throughout the frequency range from about 150 Hz to 7000 Hz. Bregman and his collaborators have carried out a series of studies on this subject <ref> (see Bregman, 1990, for an extensive review) </ref>. In one of the early studies (Bregman & Campbell, 1971), subjects were asked to report the temporal order of six tones in a sequence. Three of them were in a high-frequency range, and the other three in a low-frequency range. <p> The following is a list of several important determinants of auditory scene analysis: Frequency (pitch) proximity. The closer the frequencies of two tones, the easier they are to be grouped into the same stream. Frequency proximity is considered the prime factor in auditory scene analysis <ref> (see Bregman, 1990) </ref>. Presentation rate. The faster the presentation rate, the easier it is for each of interleaving tone sequences to be grouped into the same stream, or the harder are successive tones to be grouped into the same stream, where tones in each sequence have similar frequencies. <p> These observations are also true for simultaneously presented melodies <ref> (see Chapter 5, Bregman, 1990) </ref>. Computational Studies The technology for auditory pattern recognition (sometimes called temporal pattern recognition, see Wang, 1995b; Covey, et al., in press), particularly speech recognition, has been rapidly advanced in recent years. <p> It is not clear how the algorithms may be extended to deal with multiple simultaneous sounds, the very problem facing auditory segregation. Furthermore, it is not even clear whether sound localization aids auditory segregation or auditory segregation aids sound localization <ref> (Bregman, 1990) </ref>, or both. 5 Perhaps the only neural network model that addresses the problem of auditory segregation was one proposed by von der Malsburg and Schneider (1986). <p> Jones has suggested that a rhythm in a tone sequence helps the 12 grouping of the sequence into a single stream (see the Introduction), but it is not a required condition for producing stream segregation <ref> (Bregman, 1990) </ref>. Fig. 9 shows the simulation results with the same presentation rate but small frequency separation. The stimulus condition is illustrated in Fig. 9A, where F a is separated from F b by 4 rows. <p> Thus the pair was segregated into two streams, each of which then grouped with one tone sequence of the first pair instead. 4. A NEUROCOMPUTATIONAL THEORY OF AUDITORY SEGREGATION Based on extensive empirical studies, Bregman put forward a theory to explain experimental phenomena of auditory scene analysis <ref> (Bregman, 1990) </ref>. Bregman's theory extends Gestalt principles of grouping which result from visual observations to the auditory domain. Time is viewed as a separate dimension, and the theory builds on a number of rules of perceptual organization, such as proximity, similarity, good continuation, common fate, etc. (Rock & Palmer, 1990). <p> Thus, the performance on recalling the ordering of tones should be between total confusion and full perception of the order. This effect of intermediate stream segregation seems to happen in the experiments <ref> (Bregman, 1990, pp. 143-165) </ref>. <p> Our discussion so far concerns with only primitive auditory segregation. A good deal of psychological evidence suggests that segregation is also influenced by prior knowledge possessed by a subject <ref> (Bregman, 1990) </ref>. Thus, knowledge effects must be considered too in future research. We previously proposed a model of oscillatory associative memory (Wang et al., 1990). This associative memory model can separate an input that is a mixture of multiple patterns, based on the patterns stored in the memory.

It was first reported by Bregman and Pinker <ref> (1978, see also Bregman, 1990) </ref> who tested a repeating sequence formed by a pure tone T 3 and a complex tone composed of two pure tone components T 1 and T 2 (Fig. 12A).

Three of them were in a high-frequency range, and the other three in a low-frequency range. This situation is depicted in Figure 1. <p> It is assumed that streaming occurs if the overall system consistently shows a higher response to one of the two alternating tones. This criterion of judging whether streaming occurs is somewhat arbitrary, and cannot explain the basic fact that the subject hears two streams when streaming occurs <ref> (Bregman & Campbell, 1971) </ref>. Also, the model cannot address auditory segregation of temporally overlapping streams. More recently, Brown and Cooke (1994) presented a multistage computational model for auditory scene analysis. Like Beauvois and Meddis (1991), their model starts with a bank of bandpass filters.

Reference-contexts: The inhibitory cells send inhibition to the excitatory cell group. It has been shown that such a network of excitatory and inhibitory binary neurons exhibits emergent neural oscillations (Sporns et al., 1989; Buhmann, 1989). There is ample evidence that suggests the existence of neural oscillations in the brain <ref> (Buzski, et al., 1994) </ref>. It was first observed that the central olfactory system, namely the olfactory bulb and the olfactory cortex, yields oscillatory activity in response to olfactory stimulation (for a review see Freeman, 1991).

These observations are also true for simultaneously presented melodies (see Chapter 5, Bregman, 1990).

Reference-contexts: If two melodies overlap in the pitch domain, they are no longer perceived as the same melodies by the listeners who are familiar with each of the melodies. In fact, composers of music have made purposeful use of pitch difference to permit the perception of interleaved melodies <ref> (Dowling, 1973) </ref>. On the other hand, if listeners know in advance what melody to listen for, they can attend to it even if it is intermixed with other notes by making use of attentional expectancy, a "cocktail party effect" (Cherry, 1953) in music perception.

Reference-contexts: The underlying structure of our theory is the oscillator network of Fig. 3. Relaxation oscillators, the building blocks of the network, exhibit nonstationary behavior. This limit-cycle dynamics differs fundamentally from the commonly used limit-point dynamics, which always approaches stationary behavior <ref> (Guckenheimer & Holmes, 1983) </ref>. Oscillators in the network are enabled by auditory stimuli. Because current auditory stimuli always change and the input end projects to the oscillator network through systematic delay lines, the ensemble of the oscillators thus stimulated shifts on the network constantly (see Fig. 3).

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the rhythmic attention theory asserts the existence of an internal biological mechanism that is also rhythmic. This internal rhythmic mechanism entrains itself with the rhythms in a sequence of input tones, and generates active anticipation <ref> (Jones, 1976) </ref>. Neither of the above theories, however, makes specific reference to the underlying neural mechanisms. Bregman's theory makes no attempts to link to biological principles. While Jones 15 makes an appeal to a possible biological mechanism, her theory does not offer a plausible neural model. <p> The influence of such contexts is responsible for competition among different organizations (Figs. 14 and 15 for example). Because of this, the network also predicts an interaction between frequency proximity and presentation rate. Such "trading" between frequency and time seems to be present in human stream segregation <ref> (Jones, 1976) </ref>. Although structurally similar to the comparator model in Kammen et al. (1989), the global inhibitor of our model serves an entirely different role.

Reference-contexts: Optic fibers in turn innervate about 100 million neurons in each side of the visual cortex.

The connections from the auditory nerve to the auditory cortex are relayed by many auditory nuclei, each having an increased number of neurons so that there are about 100 million cells in each side of the auditory cortex (Handel, 1989; Kandel et al., 1991).

Reference-contexts: Grouping of multiple frequency partials that form harmonics of a fundamental frequency may be incorporated based on two cues. The first is onset/offset synchrony among these partials. The second is spectral relations among the partials. There are many models for pitch perception on the basis of harmonic relations <ref> (Moore, 1989) </ref>. Most of them are not built on neurobiology. It is a topic of future research how to combine the detection of harmonic relations with the present model of auditory segregation. Our discussion so far concerns with only primitive auditory segregation.

Reference-contexts: However, the form of nonlinearity plus the parameter g provides a dimension of flexibility that is missing from the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations. Thus, (1) can be interpreted biologically as a model of action potential generation of a single neuron <ref> (see also Morris & Lecar, 1981) </ref>. The oscillator model may also be interpreted as a mean field approximation to an interacting network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Sporns et al., 1989; Buhmann, 1989).

Reference-contexts: Latencies of neuronal responses to auditory stimuli have been found at various levels of the auditory pathway, and the range of delays increases greatly in higher auditory structures <ref> (Popper & Fay, 1992) </ref>. For instance, electrophysiological recordings in the cat auditory cortex identify up to 1.6 second delays in response to a tone sequence (Hocherman & Gilat, 1981; McKenna et al., 1989). <p> Other structural characteristics of the neural architecture of Fig. 3 include tonotopic organization and lateral connections (see Fig. 4). Tonotopic organization is a characteristic structural principle of the auditory system, including the auditory cortex <ref> (Popper & Fay, 1992) </ref>. Lateral connections within the auditory cortex have been observed (for a review see Winer, 1992), and the local projections of cortical cells can span up to 3 mm in the auditory cortex.

Reference-contexts: Bregman's theory extends Gestalt principles of grouping which result from visual observations to the auditory domain. Time is viewed as a separate dimension, and the theory builds on a number of rules of perceptual organization, such as proximity, similarity, good continuation, common fate, etc. <ref> (Rock & Palmer, 1990) </ref>. Bregman's theory can explain a variety of experimental data in terms of these rules. As for primitive auditory scene analysis, his theory claims that it is a bottom-up, data-driven process, and that it is immediate and innate.

Reference-contexts: The formation of synchrony is produced by lateral excitatory connections between relaxation oscillators, and the formation of desynchrony is produced by a global inhibitory mechanism. This mechanism of segregation is called oscillatory correlation <ref> (Terman & Wang, 1995) </ref>. Both the building block - the single oscillator model - and the mechanism of reaching synchrony and desynchrony differ fundamentally from those used by von der Malsburg and Schneider (more comparisons are given in the Discussion section). <p> The system of (1)-(6) in a slightly simplified version has recently been analyzed in general contexts by Terman and Wang (1995; for a much abbreviated version see Wang & Terman, 1995). The analysis concerns the properties of synchronization and desynchronization of Locally Excitatory Globally Inhibitory Oscillator Networks <ref> (LEGION, see Wang & Terman, 1995) </ref>. Since their studies lay down the computational foundation of the present investigation, let us briefly summarize the main results. <p> Note that the global inhibitor in Fig. 3 is used here for producing desynchrony, and that rapid synchrony occurs regardless of the global inhibitor <ref> (Terman & Wang, 1995) </ref>. From the perspective of scene analysis, this is significant since global mechanisms of synchronization would lead to indiscriminate synchrony. For example, the task of segmenting the three objects in Fig. 5A could not be performed by an oscillator network that relies on global mechanisms. <p> If a dynamic connection can be formed, its strength will be proportional to the strength of the corresponding permanent connection. The previous results <ref> (Terman & Wang, 1995) </ref> also suggest that synchronization is transitive: if separately oscillator i can synchronize with oscillator j and oscillator j can synchronize with oscillator k, then all three are synchronized.

The x-nullcline (namely dx/dt = 0 = f (x, y) + I) of (1) is a cubic curve, while the y-nullcline (dy/dt = 0 = g (x, y)) is a sigmoid function with the parameter b.

Reference-contexts: A good deal of psychological evidence suggests that segregation is also influenced by prior knowledge possessed by a subject (Bregman, 1990). Thus, knowledge effects must be considered too in future research. We previously proposed a model of oscillatory associative memory <ref> (Wang et al., 1990) </ref>. This associative memory model can separate an input that is a mixture of multiple patterns, based on the patterns stored in the memory. In the future, these two types of segregation must be integrated into a coherent model.
