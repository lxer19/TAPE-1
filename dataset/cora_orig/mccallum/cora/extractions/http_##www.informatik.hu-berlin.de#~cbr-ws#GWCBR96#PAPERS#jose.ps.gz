Abstract: Image understanding/interpretation is one of the areas where a case based reasoning system can be effectively used. The problem domain is highly amorphous and one cannot represent all the knowledge contained in a remotely sensed image with a collection of rules alone. One of the central issues in a case based reasoning system is the choice of an indexing mechanism for the retrieval of cases from the case library. In this paper, we propose an indexing mechanism that can be used for retrieving appropriate cases from a case library containing images and the corresponding interpretation. The shape vector of objects in the image is used as index followed by certain keywords(text) present in the description of the image, for retrieving cases. Keywords: Case-based reasoning, artificial neural networks, fuzzy based classification, fourier descriptors, object-relational database management system, vector-based indexing, text-based indexing, shape retrieval.

Reference-contexts: This in turn depends on the method used for the storage of cases in the case library and the indexing mechanism used. To retrieve appropriate cases from the case library cases must be indexed properly <ref> [1] </ref>. When the image database is in the order of tens of thousands of images, suitable indexing mechanisms and access structures become critical for efficient retrieval of similar cases from the case library and thus affect the speed and accuracy of interpretation [5].

Reference-contexts: Rules are formulated in such a way that they apply to a wide range of situations, thus generalising the situation. General knowledge covers the normal, but fails to provide solution to anomalous situations <ref> [3] </ref>. Construction of rules to represent knowledge is a difficult and time consuming task. As each rule depends on previous rules, addition of any extra knowledge becomes a complex process. The problem with remotely sensed data is its diversity and complexity. The problem domain is highly amorphous. <p> Cases store experiental knowledge, knowledge at an operational level. It says how a piece of knowledge was applied or how a task was carried out <ref> [3] </ref>. Case based reasoning systems store experience as such without constructing any knowledge representation schemes from them such as rules. Hence the same cases stored in the case base can be used for different applications. <p> Hence the same cases stored in the case base can be used for different applications. There are mainly two stages involved in the use of a case based reasoning system for solving problems; case retrieval and case adaptation <ref> [3] </ref>. Case retrieval is the problem of retrieving appropriate cases from the case library. The efficiency in retrieving similar cases from the case library greatly affects the correct interpretation of new images.

Reference-contexts: As mentioned earlier, in this system we are dealing with remotely sensed data containing manmade macro objects. Generally man-made objects can be identified by its outline/contour. Hence, we are using the shape vector of objects in the image as the main indexing mechanism for our system <ref> [4] </ref>. The shape vectors of prominent objects in remotely sensed data can be seperated out semi-automatically with the help of advanced image processing algorithms. These shape vectors are submitted as part of query to the database for retrieving similar shapes from the case library.

Reference-contexts: When the image database is in the order of tens of thousands of images, suitable indexing mechanisms and access structures become critical for efficient retrieval of similar cases from the case library and thus affect the speed and accuracy of interpretation <ref> [5] </ref>. The index must be selected in such a way that they represent the main features of the case, for which it is stored. In the case of remotely sensed data, there are many features on which cases can be indexed [2]. <p> When the number of images in the case base becomes very large, use of shape vector alone for indexing of cases may not be sufficient. A text-based indexing mechanism can also be used for retrieval of appropriate cases from the case library <ref> [5] </ref>. A brief description about each image is stored in the case base and certain keywords are identified in the description. When a new image is to be interpreted, certain keywords are identified from the description of this new image and is used for retrieval of appropriate cases. <p> A lower value is given to the shape vectors of those objects which frequently appear in the image, but without their presence also, the image can be interpreted correctly. Similarly, values are assigned to each vector/node in the network. A thumbnail representation <ref> [5] </ref> of each image and its textual interpretation represent the next level of abstraction. A uniform size of say 64 fi 64 pixels is used to represent these thumbnails. Since these icons/thumbnails are smaller in size, user can easily browse through them without much overhead to the system. <p> It can then be retrieval from the tape and can be displayed on the screen. 5 The Database An obect-relational database management system, Illustra is used for constructing the image database, as it helps in exploiting both relational as well as object-oriented capabilities of the database management system <ref> [5] </ref>. The relational model helps in the tabular representation of cases. It also provide database consistency and controls redundancy, thus saving storage space.

Reference-contexts: The knowledge necessary for case modification is often same as that needed in conventional rule based reasoning approach and thus the very purpose of using a case-based reasoning system is lost <ref> [6] </ref>. However, in reality, a collection of similar cases together contribute to the interpretation of a new case.
