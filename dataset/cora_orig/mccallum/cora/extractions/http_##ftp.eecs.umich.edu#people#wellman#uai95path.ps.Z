Abstract: Standard algorithms for finding the shortest path in a graph require that the cost of a path be additive in edge costs, and typically assume that costs are deterministic. We consider the problem of uncertain edge costs, with potential probabilistic dependencies among the costs. Although these dependencies violate the standard dynamic-programming decomposition, we identify a weaker stochastic consistency condition that justifies a generalized dynamic-programming approach based on stochastic dominance. We present a revised path-planning algorithm and prove that it produces optimal paths under time-dependent uncertain costs. We test the algorithm by applying it to a model of stochastic bus networks, and present empirical performance results comparing it to some alternatives. Finally, we consider extensions of these concepts to a more general class of problems of heuristic search under uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: Eiger, et al. (1985) show how utility functions that are linear or exponential in edge costs validate the optimality principle, and thus Dijkstra's algorithm. The approach taken here is a version of generalized dynamic programming <ref> (Carraway, Morin, & Moskowitz 1990) </ref>, which is essentially dynamic programming with a totally ordered criterion replaced with a partial order. We have cast generalized DP as PFS with dominance-pruning, which leads to a concise algorithm description. The partial-order concept has been most often been applied to multicriterial optimization.

Reference-contexts: This is true especially in the case of problems with multiple objectives (e.g., travel time, safety, expense, route familiarity), which have rarely been analyzed under stochastic assumptions (see <ref> (List et al. 1991) </ref> for the few exceptions). Polychronopoulos (1992) presents a taxonomy of stochastic shortest-path problems, in which the main distinction is what the uncertainty is about: 1. which edges are available to traverse, 2. which vertex results from traversing an edge, or 3. the edge costs.

Reference-contexts: We have cast generalized DP as PFS with dominance-pruning, which leads to a concise algorithm description. The partial-order concept has been most often been applied to multicriterial optimization. Stewart and White extend this to include a heuristic estimate of distance to a goal, in their multiobjective version of A* <ref> (Stewart & White 1991) </ref>. Likewise, Loui (1983) uses dominance to solve multi-attribute, deterministic shortest path problems. Mir-chandani and Soroush (1985) use mean/variance dominance to solve the problem when the cost distribution of arcs can be uniquely described by the mean and variance (this possibility had also been noted by Loui). <p> In ongoing work, we intend to extend these concepts to other search frameworks. For example, with a heuristic estimate of remaining distance, the PFS-Dominance algorithm becomes a stochastic version of A* (analogous to multiobjective A* <ref> (Stewart & White 1991) </ref>). Indeed, we have implemented such an algorithm, and have tested it on a stochastic version of the 8-puzzle, where the costs of moving tiles is uncertain and the utility function nonlinear. Results from this work will be reported at a later date.

Reference-contexts: Recall that dominance holds iff the cumulative probability of arrival by t (equation (4)) for A is at least as great as for B, for all t. It is easy to show that A dominates B iff M A M B and A B (see <ref> (Stoyan 1983) </ref>). The former condition is perhaps obviously necessary; the earliest arrival time must be earlier for the dominating bus.

Reference-contexts: Given all this prior work, the specific contribution of this paper is a formulation of the stochastic consistency condition, and identiying stochastic dominance as the appropriate pruning criterion to apply in the PFS-Dominance algorithm. The idea of stochastic consistency is related to our previous work on qualitative probabilistic influences <ref> (Wellman 1990) </ref>; the condition can be interpreted as saying that taking any edge is a positive influence on arrival time. The idea of imposing a consistency condition was inspired by the work of Kaufman and Smith (1993) (noted above) in the deterministic context.
