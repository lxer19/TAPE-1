Abstract: the appropriate threshold. This causes AFTA to underesti-mate the end of the first transition. In computing the response to , AFTA ignores the effect of since it assumes transition on occurred sufficiently in the past to affect the output. This is so because AFTA enters a stable configuration (which resets ) before the transition on activates AFTA again. It thus assumes the output to be at 0V while computing the delay for the output to rise which is not the case. The output has not yet quite reached 0V before the transition on makes it rise again. Consequently, the true output finishes its transition sooner than predicted by AFTA. For a correct computation, effects of both and together should be considered. This example shows some of the difficulties in performing timing simulation with an AFTA like approach. We have presented a new automaton based delay model, called AFTA, that is intended for use in a functional timing analyzer. Unlike previous approaches in developing an abstract delay model, AFTA accounts for analog effects like signal slope and proximity, at the gate level. Lack of space prevents us from describing our recent extensions of AFTA to work with symbolic waveforms using both temporal and functional abstraction [14] which forms the basis for functional timing analysis.
