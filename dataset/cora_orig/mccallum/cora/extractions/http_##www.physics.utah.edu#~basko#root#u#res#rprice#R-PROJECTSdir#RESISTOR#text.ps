Abstract: A truncated cone, made of material of uniform resistivity, is given in many introductory physics texts as a nontrivial problem in the computation of resistance. The intented method and answer, however, are incorrect and the problem cannot be solved by elementary means. In this paper, we (i) discuss the physics of current flow in a nonconstant cross section conductor, (i) examine the flaws in the "standard" solution for the truncated cone, (iii) present a computed resistance found from a numerically generated solution for the electrical potential in the truncated conse, and (iv) consider whether any problem can be found to fit the standard solution. In introductory courses students are taught that a solid of electrical resistivity , length `, and constant cross-sectional area A, has a resistance R = `=A. Many (most?) texts[1] for calculus-based courses try to introduce an application of calculus by including a problem in which a resistor has a nonconstant cross-section. In these books (usually in chapter 262) the student is asked to find the resistance of a truncated cone. The method that is intended can be inferred from the answer. (In the text by Wolfson and Pasachoff the student is explicity shown the approach intended.) The student is meant to consider a differential slab of resistance (which could be called a piece de resistance). The slab at location x would have differential thickness dx, and would have a resistance dR = dx=A(x), where A(x) is the cross sectional area at x.
