Abstract: This report describes the implementation of an algorithm to calculate the psychoacoustic simultaneous masked threshold for a specific signal. The implementation is derived from the "Psychoacoustic Model One" as defined in MPEG Audio encoding method. In order to make this model more flexible, some changes and additions have been made, thereby defining a new "generalized implementation". The resulting module PsychoMpegOne (C language) can handle user-specified sampling frequencies and is able to use a spectral resolution different from the fixed spectral resolution used in MPEG. In addition, the resulting global masked threshold is mapped back to the linear frequency axis in a fine resolution and can directly be compared to the signal's power density spectrum.

The psychoacoustic models provided in the MPEG-Implementation are specifically designed for the MPEG algorithms requirements. The MPEG-Algorithm will be described briefly in section 2.1. In order to define a new, general-purpose and flexible implementation of the underlying psychoacoustic model, it is necessary to change and adapt the implementation.
