Abstract: We propose a new approach to the correspondence problem that makes use of non-parametric local transforms as the basis for correlation. Non-parametric local transforms rely on the relative ordering of local intensity values, and not on the intensity values themselves. Correlation using such transforms can tolerate a significant number of outliers. This can result in improved performance near object boundaries when compared with conventional methods such as normalized correlation. We introduce two non-parametric local transforms: the rank transform, which measures local intensity, and the census transform, which summarizes local image structure. We describe some properties of these transforms, and demonstrate their utility on both synthetic and real data.

Reference-contexts: In this respect, our work is similar to that of Nishihara [12] and Seitz <ref> [14, 1] </ref>. Nishihara's transform is the sign bit of the image after convolution with a Laplacian, while Seitz's transform is the direction of the intensity gradient. Most approaches to the correspondence problem have difficulty near discon-tinuities in disparity, which occur at the boundaries of objects. <p> The motivation for our approach was to obtain better results near the edges of objects. We have obtained comparative results on synthetic data which show that our methods can outperform normalized correlation. In <ref> [1] </ref>, Aschwanden and Guggenbuhl have described the performance of a number of area-based stereo algorithms under several different noise models. 3 For convenience, we are rounding the actual values stereo algorithms, namely normalized correlation and sum of squared differences (SSD) correlation. <p> Performance is measured as function of template radius, as described in <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This problem, which we will refer to as factionalism, is a major issue in computer vision, and has been addressed with a variety of methods, including robust statistics <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, Markov Random Fields [5] and regularization [13]. The fundamental idea behind our approach is to define a local image transform that tolerates factionalism.

However, such measures are very expensive to compute, and do not capture the spatial structure of images. Probably the most similar approach to ours is the work based on robust statistics <ref> [2, 11, 3] </ref>. Robust statistics differs from our approach in that they emphasize reducing the influence of outliers. Implicit in this work is the assumption that outliers are distributed randomly. However, at the edges of objects, factionalism produces outliers with consistent distributions.

Reference-contexts: If the two images are temporally consecutive, then computing correspondence determines motion. If the two images are spatially separated but simultaneous, then computing correspondence determines stereo depth. Area-based approaches to the correspondence problem <ref> [4] </ref> find a dense solution, usually by relying on some kind of statistical correlation between local intensity regions. In this paper we propose a new area-based approach to the correspondence problem, based on non-parametric local transforms followed by correlation.

Reference-contexts: Some of the pixels come from the object, and some from other parts of the scene. As a result, the local pixel distribution will in general be multimodal near a boundary. This poses a problem for many correspondence algorithms, such as normalized correlation <ref> [6] </ref>. Correspondence algorithms are usually based on standard statistical methods, which are best suited to a single population. Parametric measures, such as the mean or variance, do not behave well in the presence of distinct sub-populations, each with its own coherent parameters.

Reference-contexts: This distinguishes the rank transform from other attempts to use non-parametric measures such as median filters, mode filters or rank filters <ref> [7] </ref>. To compute correspondence, we have used L 1 correlation (minimizing the sum of absolute values of differences) on the rank-transformed images. The second non-parametric transform is named the census transform.

Reference-contexts: Ultimately, we would like to avoid the correlation phase altogether and simply match pixels according to a set of semi-independent measures, in a manner similar to that proposed by Kass <ref> [8] </ref>. Another limitation of our approach is that the local measures rely heavily upon the intensity of the center pixel. This has not been an issue in practice, but we propose to address it by doing comparisons from a local median intensity instead of I (P ).

Reference-contexts: Correspondence can be computed by transforming both images and then using correlation. For this approach to succeed, the transform must result in significant local variation within a given image; in addition, it must give similar results near corresponding points between the two images. (Marr and Nishihara <ref> [10] </ref> refer to these two properties as sensitivity and stability.) Finally, to handle stereo imagery, the transform should be invariant under changes in image gain and bias. Our approach relies on local transforms based on non-parametric measures that are designed to tolerate factionalism.

Reference-contexts: Finally, in section 5 we survey related work and discuss some planned extensions. 2 Non-parametric local transforms Our approach to the correspondence problem is first to apply a local transform to the image, and then to use correlation. In this respect, our work is similar to that of Nishihara <ref> [12] </ref> and Seitz [14, 1]. Nishihara's transform is the sign bit of the image after convolution with a Laplacian, while Seitz's transform is the direction of the intensity gradient. Most approaches to the correspondence problem have difficulty near discon-tinuities in disparity, which occur at the boundaries of objects.

Non-parametric statistics [9] is distinguished by the use of ordering information among data, rather than the data values themselves. Non-parametric local transforms, which we introduced in <ref> [15] </ref>, are local image transformations that rely on the relative ordering of intensities, and not on the intensity values themselves. 3 The rank transform and the census transform We next describe two non-parametric local transforms. The first, called the rank transform, is a non-parametric measure of local intensity. <p> We plan to explore using higher-order differences, as well as the information contained in the total ordering of the local pixel intensities. We are also interested in efficient algorithms for implementing such transforms. <ref> [15] </ref> describes a number of fast algorithms for computing the rank trans-4 The tree imagery appears courtesy of Harlyn Baker and Bob Bolles form based on dynamic programming.
