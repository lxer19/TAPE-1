Abstract: A rational and comprehensive approach for indicating when cesarean delivery (C/S) is necessary would result in a limitation in the overall maternal risks of childbirth as well as in the cost of health care. For this purpose, we are in the process of developing a set of computer aided design (CAD) models and a systematic and flexible simulation of the birth process. Different from the volume-based approach, our system provides three dimensional surface models of 1) the maternal bony pelvis obtained from digital radiographic images of computed tomographic (CT) pelvimetry and 2) fetal anatomy obtained from ultrasound images. Our modelling system and initial simulations bear many similarities to the results of assembly/disassembly planning research in robotics. Our initial result on generating the detailed CAD surface models is reported in this paper.

Reference-contexts: There is a vast amount of literature on three-dimensional computer modelling and computer graphics [3, 9, 14]. There is, however, little to be found on the computerized modelling of anatomy <ref> [1, 4, 5] </ref>. It has been re-recognized that one very important dimension of labor that has been neglected is the relation between the fetal and pelvic size and shape, which can be used as guidance in the deliveries.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we report our initial result on generating the precise CAD models from a sequence of 2D digital images, with which one can describe the surfaces of bones found in CT scans within a CAD product, the AutoCAD solid modelling system <ref> [2] </ref>. AutoCAD provides three types of 3D models: wireframe, surface and solid. Our experiments used mainly the surface models, which can be approximated by a polygon mesh for further control of the modeled surface.

Reference-contexts: We model polyhedral as well as non-polyhedral surfaces, which are most useful in the analysis of contact and relative motions among objects. This latter emphasis also has a theoretical basis developed in robotics research <ref> [6, 8] </ref>, where the mathematical tool for describing symmetries, group theory, is applied to the analysis of surface contact. 2 For a detailed, clear account of the terms used here and about childbirth in general, one can refer to [13]. 3 The maternal measurements are obtained using conventional X-ray pelvimetry techniques. <p> These symmetries form a group, known as the symmetry group of the surface. Relative motions between a pair of solids can be expressed precisely and completely by the symmetry groups of the contacting surfaces. A group theoretic formalization for describing surface contact between solids has been developed in <ref> [6, 8] </ref>, where it is shown that the exact relative motion (position) of solids under surface contacts, which is either rigid or articulated, can be computed using the symmetry groups of contacting surfaces. <p> A group theoretical analysis of joint movement (neck joint of the fetus) is to be applied to a simplified model of the atlas and axis of the fetal anatomy. Like the simulation of the disassembly process in robotic assembly planning <ref> [6] </ref>, the model of the fetus can be successively translated and rotated with respect to the model of the pelvis within the AutoCAD system. One can then check whether there exists any intersection between the trajectory volume swept by the fetus and the birth canal.

Reference-contexts: A geometric representation for symmetry groups and an efficient group intersection algorithm using characteristic invariants has also been implemented <ref> [7] </ref>. This offers a rapid determination of an object's position with respect to its specified surface contacts with its environment. One advantage of this formulation is its ability to express continuous motions between two surface-contacting solids in a computational manner, and to avoid combinatorics arising from multiple relationships.
