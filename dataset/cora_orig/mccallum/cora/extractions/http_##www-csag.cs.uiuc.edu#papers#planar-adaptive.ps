Abstract: Network throughput can be increased by allowing mul-tipath, adaptive routing. Adaptive routing allows more freedom in the paths taken by messages, spreading load over physical channels more evenly. The flexibility of adaptive routing introduces new possibilities of deadlock. Previous deadlock avoidance schemes in k-ary n-cubes require an exponential number of virtual channels [17]. We describe a family of deadlock-free routing algorithms, called planar-adaptive routing algorithms which require only a constant number of virtual channels, independent of network size and dimension. Planar-adaptive routing algorithms reduce the complexity of deadlock prevention by reducing the number of choices at each routing step. In the fault-free case, planar-adaptive networks are guaranteed to be deadlock-free. In the presence of network faults, the planar-adaptive router can be extended with misrouting to produce a working network which remains provably deadlock free and is provably livelock free. In addition, planar adaptive networks can simultaneously support both in-order and adaptive, out-of-order packet delivery.

Reference-contexts: Large-scale machines increase the effect of node latency, favoring networks with greater connectivity. Looser constraints on wiring bisection and pin-bounds also make higher-dimensional networks more attractive. Furthermove, recent results indicate that higher-dimensional networks may exhibit more robust performance over a range of communication locality <ref> [1] </ref>. Cost Metrics In routing networks, the most expensive part is the wires for the physical channels. Following that, the second most expensive elements are the buffers and switching hardware (crossbar or other). Only if routing algorithms become very complex is routing logic a significant contributor.

Reference-contexts: Not only does the lesser packet requirement reduce network loading, it also may improve a critical performance feature, memory operation latency, by eliminating waits for acknowledgements in the protocol. In a number of other shared-memory protocols, preserving message-transmission order may also simplify the protocol and/or improve its performance <ref> [2, 10] </ref>. Our minimal, adaptive routing algorithms support both in-order packet delivery and adaptive, unordered packet delivery simultaneously. All traffic must be specified as ordered or unordered.

Reference-contexts: In multiprocessor networks, routing decisions must be made in a single cycle, and thus cannot incorporate complex distributed deadlock prevention and detection algorithms. Consequently, we focus on deadlock prevention schemes based on restricting the routing algorithm <ref> [3] </ref>. Because the physical network has cycles naive routing schemes can produce deadlock, so we virtualize the network by introducing virtual channels (really only extra buffers) and define routing functions on the virtual networks. <p> Dally and Seitz use virtual channels and restrict routing to implement deadlock-free routing in k-ary n-cubes <ref> [3] </ref>. However, their scheme assumes a deterministic routing algorithm, dimension-order routing. A minimal adaptive routing scheme described by Lin-der and Harden [17] extends the techniques of Dally and Seitz to allow adaptive routing while preventing deadlock.

Reference-contexts: Restricting the adaptivity in this fashion reduces the coupling between network dimensions, reducing the possibilities for inter-dimensional resource cycles. Consequently fewer resources are needed to avoid deadlock. 5.1 Notation and Terminology We adopt notation similar to that in <ref> [4, 17] </ref>. We presume for the purposes of discussion, a physical topology of a k-ary n-cube with no wraparound paths.

Reference-contexts: However, the hardware cost of their approach is significant, requiring a large number of virtual channels per physical channel. Such hardware complexity typically reduces attainable network speed. Dally and Aoki have defined another adaptive routing algorithm based on the notion of "dimension-reversals" <ref> [5] </ref>. Each dimension reversal corresponds to a departure from dimension-order routing. One additional virtual channel is required for each dimension reversal. Consequently, their scheme supports only a fixed number of dimension reversals. <p> A primary concern in adaptive networks is how much it costs to prevent deadlock. To assure deadlock-free routing, the planar scheme requires only three virtual channels for k-ary n-cubes without wraparound channels. This is a dramatic improvement over previously published schemes <ref> [17, 5] </ref>. As shown in Figure 3, the Linder-Harden scheme deadlock prevention scheme requires 2 n1 virtual channels, a significant hardware overhead. Equally important, deadlock and livelock are avoided without any complex reversal counting [5] or aging schemes [18]. <p> This is a dramatic improvement over previously published schemes [17, 5].

This means that planar-adaptive routers will be very simple and can make routing decisions very rapidly. As a result, they may run faster than adaptive routers requiring complex techniques for deadlock and livelock prevention.

Reference-contexts: All traffic must be specified as ordered or unordered. Planar-adaptive routing guarantees in-order packet delivery for the ordered traffic both in the fault-free case, and in the presence of static faults 6 . For simplicity, we assume only one "virtual lane" <ref> [7] </ref> per virtual channel, so packets routed along a single path cannot pass each other. In a multi-lane virtual channel system, passing can be prevented by limiting the ordered traffic for each node to one lane. In any network that uses multipath routing, preserving packet transmission order is difficult. <p> Fewer virtual channels may allow the construction of faster routers (fewer buffer loads to drive), or the additional hardware available may be used to incorporate other performance enhancing features such as more "virtual lanes" <ref> [7] </ref>. Planar-adaptive routing is relatively low cost. Compared to Linder and Harden's scheme, planar-adaptive routing requires significantly fewer virtual channels. Planar-adaptive routing requires only three buffers per physical channel, allowing the construction of very small, fast routers.

Reference-contexts: However, one thing is certain; Dally and Aoki's scheme is not fault-tolerant. In addition, their scheme may require complex routing logic.

A table comparing the virtual channel hardware requirements of existing techniques and planar-adaptive routing is given in Figure 3 2 . We include only those techniques which are deadlock-free over a variety of k-ary n-cubes, particularly those with larger radixes (k &gt; 2).

Reference-contexts: Non-minimal or misrouting-based adaptive routing. Packets may temporarily move away from their destination (misrouting), but eventually arrive at their destination. Due to misrouting, the distance a packet travels may not be minimal. The network may do some unnecessary work. Significant work has explored non-minimal approaches <ref> [19, 15] </ref>. While such efforts have produced interesting routers which can outperform minimal adaptive routers in some cases, the use of misrouting makes prevention of livelock a difficult problem. <p> Complex schemes for packet priority and aging have been proposed, but they complicate the router logic required for routing and arbitration decisions. One interesting non-deterministic approach to livelock prevention is the Chaos router <ref> [15] </ref>, but its efficiency and cost are still under evaluation. The use of misrouting in non-minimal adaptive routing also makes it difficult to preserve packet transmission order. Order-preserving packet delivery can significantly reduce the number of packets required to implement serialization protocols [16].

Reference-contexts: The use of misrouting in non-minimal adaptive routing also makes it difficult to preserve packet transmission order. Order-preserving packet delivery can significantly reduce the number of packets required to implement serialization protocols <ref> [16] </ref>. Minimal routers are attractive because they do not waste any effort. Since packets are never transmitted away from their destination, it's possible to utilize the full wire capacity 1 of the network productively. Minimal routers can also support order-preserving routing efficiently. For these reasons, we focus on minimal routers. <p> Landin and Haridi showed that in-order packet delivery, or "race-free" networks can significantly reduce the number of packets required to implement serialization protocols for coherent shared memory <ref> [16] </ref>. Not only does the lesser packet requirement reduce network loading, it also may improve a critical performance feature, memory operation latency, by eliminating waits for acknowledgements in the protocol.
