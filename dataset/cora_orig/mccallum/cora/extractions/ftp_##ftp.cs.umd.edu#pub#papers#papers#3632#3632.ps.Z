Abstract: We propose a new bandwidth allocation scheme for VBR video traffic in ATM networks. The scheme is tailored to MPEG-coded video sources that require stringent and deterministic quality-of-service guarantees. By exploiting the temporal structure of MPEG sources, we show that our scheme results in an effective bandwidth which, in most cases, is less than the source peak rate. The reduction in the bandwidth requirement is achieved without sacrificing any perceived QoS. Efficient procedures are provided for the computation of the effective bandwidth under heterogeneous MPEG sources. The effective bandwidth strongly depends on the arrangement of the multiplexed streams which is a measure of the degree of synchronization between the GOP patterns of different streams. Assuming that all possible arrangements are equi-probable, we derive an expression for the asymptotic tail distribution of the effective bandwidth. From the tail distribution, we compute several performance measures for the call blocking probability when the allocation is made based on the effective bandwidth. In the case of homogeneous sources, we give a closed-form expression for the `best' arrangement that results in the `optimal' effective bandwidth. Numerical examples based on real MPEG traces are used to demonstrate the advantages of our scheme.

Reference-contexts: The concept of effective bandwidth (also known as equivalent capacity) was investigated in several previous studies within a stochastic framework (for example, see [4] and <ref> [1] </ref>). In this paper, the effective bandwidth is defined within a deterministic framework to guarantee zero cell loss rate and negligible queueing delays. The following simple example demonstrates the bandwidth gains that can be achieved by multiplexing MPEG streams while simultaneously supporting deterministic QoS guarantees.

Reference-contexts: A scene can be loosely defined as a segment of the movie with relatively consistent level of activity. Sizes of I frames (similarly, P and B frames) within a scene are close is value. Since on the average a scene lasts for several seconds <ref> [2] </ref>, changing the compression pattern (whose time scale is smaller than one second) will have little effect on the maximum sizes of I , P , and B frames within a scene.

Reference-contexts: Typically, a stream with deterministic QoS requirements (e.g., no cell losses) is not statistically multiplexed with other streams. Depending on its delay requirement, such a stream is either allocated its peak rate, or (if the some buffering delay can be tolerated) its peak rate over a finite interval <ref> [6] </ref>. In this paper, we investigate the bandwidth requirements of video streams that are generated by MPEG encoders. We only consider the video compression part of the MPEG standard. <p> For our purposes, we use a deterministic traffic model which is similar, to some extent 1 , to the D-BIND model that was suggested in <ref> [6] </ref>. In our model, an MPEG stream s i is represented by a traffic envelop, b i (t), that provides a time-varying upper bound on the actual bit rate of s i . <p> When N &gt; L, only the removal of certain streams preserves the optimality of the arrangement. 7 Numerical Results In this section, we use real MPEG traces to provide numerical examples of the analytical results presented in previous sections.
