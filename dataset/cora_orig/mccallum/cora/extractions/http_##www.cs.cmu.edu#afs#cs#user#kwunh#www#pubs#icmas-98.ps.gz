Abstract: Robotic soccer is a challenging research domain which involves multiple agents that need to collaborate in an adversarial environment to achieve specific objectives. In this paper, we describe CMUnited-97, the team of small robotic agents that we developed to enter the RoboCup-97 competition. We designed and built the robotic agents, devised the appropriate vision algorithm, and developed algorithms for strategic collaboration between the robots in an uncertain and dynamic environment. The robots can organize themselves in formations, hold specific roles, and pursue their goals. In game situations, they have demonstrated their collaborative behaviors on multiple occasions. The robots can also switch roles to maximize the overall performance of the team. We present our vision processing algorithm which successfully tracks multiple moving objects and predicts trajectories. The paper then focusses on the agent behaviors ranging from low-level individual behaviors to coordinated, strategic team behaviors. CMUnited won the RoboCup-97 small-robot competition at IJCAI-97 in Nagoya, Japan. fl This research is sponsored in part by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and Rome Laboratory, Air Force Materiel Command, USAF, under agreement number F30602-95-1-0018 and in part by the Department of the Navy, Office of Naval Research under contract number N00014-95-1-0591.

Reference-contexts: Systems with on-board and off-board types have appeared in recent years. All have found that the reactiveness of soccer robots requires a vision system with a high processing cycle time. However, due to the rich visual input, researchers have found that dedicated processors or even DSPs are often needed <ref> [1, 7] </ref>. Our current system uses a frame-grabber with frame-rate transfer from a 3CCD camera. A relatively slow processor (166MHz Pentium) was at the heart of the vision system, performing all vision computations.

Reference-contexts: All of these skills must be executed while avoiding obstacles such as the walls and other robots. The navigational movement control is done via closed-loop reactive control. The control strategy follows a modified version of a simple Braitenburg vehicle <ref> [2] </ref>. The Braitenburg love vehicle defines a reactive control mechanism that directs a differentially driven robot to a certain destination point (goal).

Reference-contexts: Like for real soccer players, it is often essential for robots to predict future locations of the ball (or even of the other players). We have used an Extended Kalman filter (EKF) for such a purpose <ref> [3] </ref>. The Kalman filter is very suitable for such a purpose since the detection of the ball's location is noisy. The EKF is a recursive estimator for a possibly non-linear system. The goal of the filter is to estimate the state of a system.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the system described here was designed specifically for RoboCup97 in which several robotic teams competed on an even playing field. <ref> [4] </ref>. The scientific opportunities involved in this effort are enormous. Our particular scientific focus is on multiagent systems coupled with collaborative and adversarial learning in an environment that requires real-time dynamic planning. This paper describes the overall architecture of our robotic soccer system.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction As robots become more adept at operating in the real world, the high-level issues of collaborative and adversarial planning and learning in real-time situations are becoming more important. An interesting emerging domain that is particularly appropriate for studying these issues is Robotic Soccer. Although realistic simulation environments exist <ref> [5, 6] </ref> and are useful, it is important to have some actual physical agents in order to address the full complexity of the task. Robotic soccer with real robots is an exciting domain for many reasons.

Reference-contexts: These high-level, multiagent behaviors were originally developed in simulation and then transferred over to the robot-control code. Only the run-time passing evaluation function was redefined. Further details, particularly about the flexible team structures, are available in <ref> [9] </ref>. 3.2.1 Positions, Formations, and Active Modes Positions are defined as flexible regions within which the player attempts to move towards the ball. <p> On the other hand, if winning, they might choose a defensive formation. The precise conditions for switching positions and formations are decided upon in advance, in what we call a locker-room agreement, <ref> [9] </ref> in order to eliminate the need for complex on-line negotiation protocols. Although the default action of each robot is to go to its position and face the ball, there are three active modes from which the robot must choose.
