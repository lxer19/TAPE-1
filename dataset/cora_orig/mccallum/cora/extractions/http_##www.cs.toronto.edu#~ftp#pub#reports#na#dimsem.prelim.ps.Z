Abstract: for the Numerical Solution of Stiff ODEs on Parallel Computers: A Preliminary Report Abstract We describe a new class of General Linear Methods (GLMs) with the following properties: the methods are strictly diagonally implicit, allowing efficient parallel implementation; the stability matrix has no spurious eigenvalues (i.e., only one eigenvalue of the stability matrix is non-zero); the methods have high stage order, allowing them to retain their order on problems for which order reduction might otherwise be a problem; the methods are L-stable, making them suitable for the solution of stiff problems. As well as presenting some order barriers, we derive and test methods of orders 2-6.

In the first and second rows, 1 ; 2 2 [0; 5], while in the third row (a magnified view of the second row), 1 ; 2 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. For this method, T 1 , T 2 , and T 3 (first row) show only small variation, which is fortunate because keeping maxcf reasonable while achieving L-stability is quite restrictive on 1 and 2 . <p> The value 2 = 0:29 was chosen as the line passing through the L-stable region as well as through an area of small maxcf. The plots in the last row have 1 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> on the horizontal axis, while 2 is fixed at 0:29. The T i 's are the essentially constant lines in the left plot. We then chose 1 = 0:37 for the smallest maxcf in the L-stable interval shown in the right plot. <p> It is y 0 = ! sin y; which for the initial condition y (x 0 ) = y 0 satisfies y (x) = 2 arctan y 0 This problem was integrated on both <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and [0; 100] with initial condition y (0) = 1 and ! = 1. The short interval was used to demonstrate correct order behaviour, while the long interval was used to verify stability on a stiff problem. The results for the DIMSEMs on [0; 1] are shown in Section <p> problem was integrated on both <ref> [0; 1] </ref> and [0; 100] with initial condition y (0) = 1 and ! = 1. The short interval was used to demonstrate correct order behaviour, while the long interval was used to verify stability on a stiff problem. The results for the DIMSEMs on [0; 1] are shown in Section 10.1.1. All the DIMSEM methods produce the expected local order on this problem. <p> The results for the DIMSEMs on [0; 100] are shown in Section 10.1.2. The results are similar to those for the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, except that the endpoint global order for the sixth order DIMSEM is rather erratic. The endpoint global errors remain extremely small for all the DIMSEMs. This demonstrates that the methods are stable, and the stepsize is not being significantly restricted by the stiffness of the problem. <p> The endpoint global errors remain extremely small for all the DIMSEMs. This demonstrates that the methods are stable, and the stepsize is not being significantly restricted by the stiffness of the problem. The results for the ADM methods on <ref> [0; 1] </ref> are shown in Section 10.2.1. Possibly due to their larger error coefficients, the ADM methods approach their expected local and global orders more clearly before the error becomes limited by roundoff. <p> Except for the endpoint global order of the fifth order ADM, all the observed orders are quite clear. 10.1 Test Results for the DIMSEMs 10.1.1 Problem 1 This subsection gives the test results for the problem y 0 = sin y; y (0) = 1; on the interval <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, for each of the DIMSEM methods.

Reference-contexts: If 1 = = s , the method is called singly diagonally implicit. Such methods have been investigated, for instance, by Burrage and Chipman <ref> [3] </ref> for use on sequential machines. <p> The first subclass of GLMs which we considered was Diagonally Implicit Multistep Runge Kutta methods (DIMRKs), which are MRKs with diagonal B 1 . Two classes of these methods, arising from modifications to the methods of Burrage and Chipman <ref> [3] </ref>, were investigated initially. The first satisfies B (r + s 1) and C (r 1), and hence has order at least r, with c 1 ; : : : ; c s and 1 ; : : : ; s as free parameters. <p> The A-stability of these candidate methods was then verified theoretically using a technique based on the Schur criterion and the maximum principle of complex analysis <ref> [3] </ref>. Although methods of orders 2 to 5 were found this way, this simple approach does not appear to be extensible to higher orders due to the rapidly increasing cost, as order increases, of solving the order conditions by brute force. <p> The error coefficients of the L-stable DIMSEMs were then compared with those of two other classes of A-stable methods, the MRKs of Burrage and Chipman <ref> [3] </ref> and the Gauss and Radau-IA IRKs (see, for example, [7]). The MRKs are implicit with a lower-triangular B 1 matrix, while the Gauss/Radau formulas are fully implicit Runge-Kutta methods. <p> This problem is used to investigate the phenomenon of order-reduction, which tends to make methods perform with less than their asymptotic order if 32 larger stepsizes are used. There is evidence that the observed order of a GLM can be expected to approximate its stage order <ref> [3] </ref>. The results for the DIMSEMs on this problem are shown in Section 10.1.3. Each DIMSEM shows the expected local order. The global order on this problem is one higher than expected in general, and equal to the local order.

Reference-contexts: The methods developed in this report make use of the A, B and C simplifying assumptions of Burrage and Moss <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> The importance of these simplifying assumptions is given by a theorem of Burrage and Moss <ref> [4] </ref>, which states that a GLM satisfying A (p), B (p), and C (p 1) has order at least p, provided the method is stable. <p> The solution of these simplified order conditions, while by no means trivial, is much easier than that of the raw order conditions described earlier.

Reference-contexts: Our eventual concentration on a new class of methods for which A-stability is much easier to analyse grew out of a seminar <ref> [5] </ref> given by Butcher, in which he introduced his work on DIMSIM methods. <p> They are included only to illustrate the parameter-selection process.

Reference-contexts: methods will therefore be suitable for machines with a few processors, such as shared-memory machines, rather than the hundreds or thousands of processors available with local-memory, message-passing architectures. 1.1 General Linear Methods The methods developed here are members of the class of general linear methods (GLMs) introduced by Butcher. (See <ref> [6] </ref> for a survey.) They are also known as multivalue methods (MVMs). <p> points determined by the internal abscissae c 1 ; : : : ; c s , A starting method is required to provide the initial approximation y 0 , and, if the solution itself is not a component of y n , a finishing method is needed to recover it <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. Two common types of GLM are Nordsieck methods, in which the external stages ap 1 proximate scaled derivatives of the solution of the ODE, and multistep Runge-Kutta (MRK) methods, in which they approximate the solution itself at various points. <p> Remark. The assumption q () 6= 0 is used to exclude methods for which ^y n = 0 for all n. This exclusion is not unreasonable, as such methods are likely to lack a suitable finishing method <ref> [6] </ref> for recovering the solution of the IVP. Proof. We apply the method to the linear test problem u 0 = u, u (0) = 1, for which u (x) = e x and where z = h.

Reference-contexts: Then for the ODE u 0 (x) = f (u (x)), D (t) is defined recursively by D ()(u) = u; and If K &gt; 1, the multiplication of vectors is done componentwise. More on Butcher series may be found in <ref> [2, 7, 15, 16, 17, 19] </ref>. As an example, if '(t) = c (t) , then B ('; u (x n )) is the Taylor series for u (x n + ch) expanded about the point x n . <p> The error coefficients of the L-stable DIMSEMs were then compared with those of two other classes of A-stable methods, the MRKs of Burrage and Chipman [3] and the Gauss and Radau-IA IRKs (see, for example, <ref> [7] </ref>). The MRKs are implicit with a lower-triangular B 1 matrix, while the Gauss/Radau formulas are fully implicit Runge-Kutta methods. In Burrage and Chipman's methods, the choices of the free parameters used were those given on page 410 of their paper, which were used in their numerical testing. <p> The contours in T 1 and T 2 show hills rising from a central valley. The line c 6 = 5:7 was chosen as passing near the minima of the T i 's and maxcf. The final plot has c 5 2 <ref> [7; 0] </ref> on the horizontal axis with c 6 = 5:7. The U-shaped function is maxcf/2 and the others are T 1 and T 2 . We chose c 5 = 5:67 to minimise (roughly) T 1 and T 2 in the plateau region of maxcf.

Although Butcher <ref> [9] </ref> mentions it as a useful property, Butcher's, and Butcher and Jackiewicz's, DIMSIMs, do not possess the single-eigenvalue property. We have found it useful however for the simplification it provides in the search for A-stable methods. <p> Aside from facilitating the search for A-stable methods, single-eigenvalue methods might have better numerical properties, as there are no spurious solutions arising from the non-principal eigenvalues which contribute to the solution until they die out.

Reference-contexts: A global error of order p usually corresponds to a local error of order p + 1, although it is possible in certain situations to have local and global errors of the same order <ref> [12, 22] </ref>. When classifying methods according to their accuracy, the order of the method is typically the most significant, while the size of the local error coefficients distinguishes between methods of the same order.

Using the theorem of Hairer and Wanner <ref> [16] </ref> on the composition of Butcher series, we can express e (t) recursively in terms of local error coefficients of trees of lower order, the true-value function q, and the coefficient matrices A 1 ; B 1 ; A 2 ; B 2 of the method.

Reference-contexts: The following three theorems and two corollaries apply to a larger class of methods than DIMSEMs, in that B 1 need not be diagonal. They extend to single-eigenvalue GLMs the corresponding result of Jackson and Ntrsett for Runge-Kutta methods <ref> [20, Theorem 2.1] </ref>. Theorem 1 Let e 1 (z); : : : ; e r (z) be the eigenvalues of the stability matrix M (z) of a GLM.

Reference-contexts: The endpoint global errors appear to be roundoff-limited, and so the corresponding orders are not meaningful. The small endpoint global errors however indicate the methods are stable. The second test problem is that of Prothero and Robinson <ref> [21] </ref>, y 0 = g 0 (x) + ! (y g (x)) ; where g is a given function. With the initial condition y (0) = g (0), it has the solution y (x) = g (x), but can be made arbitrarily stiff by choosing ! t 0.

Reference-contexts: A global error of order p usually corresponds to a local error of order p + 1, although it is possible in certain situations to have local and global errors of the same order <ref> [12, 22] </ref>. When classifying methods according to their accuracy, the order of the method is typically the most significant, while the size of the local error coefficients distinguishes between methods of the same order. <p> Then the order of the global error of the method is at most p. Proof. By Theorem 2, the order of the local error of the method is at most p + 1. By <ref> [22, Theorem 5.3] </ref> for example, it follows that the order of the global error is at most p + 1 also. We prove below by contradiction that the order of the global error is not p + 1, so it is at most p.

Reference-contexts: The second satisfies B (r) and C (r), also has order at least r, and has fl 1 ; : : : ; fl s1 (defined in (4)) as free parameters. The simplified order conditions were solved algebraically using Maple <ref> [23] </ref>, and the free parameter space was searched numerically for methods that appeared to be A-stable. The A-stability of these candidate methods was then verified theoretically using a technique based on the Schur criterion and the maximum principle of complex analysis [3].

Reference-contexts: From (26) and a result of Wilkinson <ref> [24, Chapter 2, Section 5] </ref>, it follows that M (z) has an eigenvalue e z + O (z q+1 ), which must be e 1 (z), the one nonzero eigenvalue of M (z).
