Reference-contexts: Living on Video Games Alone : : :[R]einforcement theory has been applied to the letter by video game designers. This leaves little doubt that individuals susceptible to such conditioning may be at risk : : : for developing an obsessive-compulsive attitude to the video games : : : <ref> (Braun and Giroux, 1989, p.101) </ref> Fearful of the potential for "addiction," many parents restrict their sons' use of video games. For example, eight-year-old Patrick is allowed to play only on the weekends, at night, or on a rainy day.

Reference-contexts: Reasons for incorporating cooperation and collaboration into game design include the appeal to girls of games that involve working with others or are otherwise based on relationships <ref> (Inkpen et al., 1993) </ref>. Will boys like games that girls like|ones in which the primary goal is not to "beat" the game or ones that do not pitch good against evil? Violence Indisputably, many of the most attractive, best-selling video games abound with violence and competition. <p> We readily conjecture that these at-risk boys generally like playing video games. We do not know, however, how important a violent or aggressive theme is to the attractiveness of a game, nor the effect of incorporating elements of cooperation and collaboration into game design <ref> (Inkpen et al., 1993) </ref>. Exploring these issues is particularly important, since most girls are interested in games that have little or no violence and include cooperation and collaboration. We believe that it is unlikely that a single type of game will appeal to most at-risk children.

Reference-contexts: past decade, continues with statistics about violence in popular video games: 6 Of the 47 top-rated video games made for Nintendo systems, only seven do not have violence as their major theme. (Provenzo, 1992, p.31). (For an indepth, critical study of Nintendo games as a social and cultural phenomenon, see <ref> (Provenzo, 1991) </ref>.) Many educators, researchers, and parents also are concerned with the negative elements that seem to pervade many electronic games. Studies conducted by Anderson and Ford (1986) indicate that playing aggressive video games can produce short-term higher levels of anxiety in the player.

Reference-contexts: Aggression, Violence, Competition, Fast-action, and Speed The world of video games has no conscientious objectors: : : One must shoot or be shot, consume or be consumed, fight or lose <ref> (Provenzo, 1992, p.31) </ref>. <p> <ref> (Provenzo, 1992, p.31) </ref>. Provenzo, who has studied how computers and other media influence children and education for the past decade, continues with statistics about violence in popular video games: 6 Of the 47 top-rated video games made for Nintendo systems, only seven do not have violence as their major theme. (Provenzo, 1992, p.31). (For an indepth, critical study of Nintendo games as a social and cultural phenomenon, see (Provenzo, 1991).) Many educators, researchers, and parents also are concerned with the negative elements that seem to pervade many electronic games. <p> 9 The Anti-social Player There are no team players [in the world of video games]; each man or woman is out for himself or herself. : : : Of the 40 [top-rated Nintendo] games that emphasize violence, nearly all are based on the principle of an autonomous individual acting alone. <ref> (Provenzo, 1992, p.31) </ref> As Provenzo notes, the subjects of many popular video games operate alone, in anonymity. He claims that playing such games allows children to act independently of social norms. Selnow (1984) suggests that frequent players of video games may be fulfilling their friendship needs with the games.
