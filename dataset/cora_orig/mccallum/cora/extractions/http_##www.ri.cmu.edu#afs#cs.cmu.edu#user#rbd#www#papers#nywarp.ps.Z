Title: Abstract Time Warping of Compound Events and Signals  
Author: Roger B. Dannenberg 
Address: Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA  
Affiliation: Carnegie Mellon University  
Abstract: Functions of time are often used to represent continuous parameters and the passage of musical time (tempo). A new approach generalizes previous work in three ways. First, common temporal operations of stretching and shifting are special cases of a new general time-warping operation. Second, these operations are ``abstract.'' Instead of operating directly on signals or events, they operate on abstract behaviors that interpret the operations at an appropriate structural level. Third, time warping can be applied to both discrete events and continuous signals.
