Abstract: As increasingly large volumes of sophisticated options are traded in world financial markets, determining a fair price for these options has become an important and difficult computational problem. Many valuation codes use the binomial pricing model, in which the stock price is driven by a random walk. In this model, the value of an n-period option on a stock is the expected time-discounted value of the future cash flow on an n-period stock price path. Path-dependent options are particularly difficult to value since the future cash flow depends on the entire stock price path rather than on just the final stock price. Currently such options are approximately priced by Monte Carlo methods with error bounds that hold only with high probability and which are reduced by increasing the number of simulation runs. In this article we show that pricing an arbitrary path-dependent option is #-P hard. We show that certain types of path-dependent options can be valued exactly in polynomial time. Asian options are path-dependent options that are particularly hard to price, and for these we design deterministic polynomial-time approximate algorithms. We show that the value of a perpetual American put option (which can be computed in constant time) is in many cases a good approximation to the value of an otherwise identical n-period American put option. In contrast to Monte Carlo methods, our algorithms have guaranteed error bounds that are polynomially small (and in some cases exponentially small) in the maturity n. For the error analysis we derive large-deviation results for random walks that may be of independent interest.

Reference-contexts: An option is priced, or valued, by assuming (a) some model of the price behavior of the underlying asset (e.g., a stock), and (b) a pricing theory. In a landmark article, Black and Scholes <ref> [2] </ref> introduced a continuous-time model for option valuation that underlies most pricing methods in use today. Their model is based on Arbitrage Pricing Theory [10, 17].

In this section we investigate the difference between an American put and an otherwise equivalent American perpetual put. Let T 0 be the set of stopping times t such that t 0 almost surely. <p> Now consider an American perpetual put. The payoff function in this case is given by g (S k ) = (L S k ) + , where L is the strike price. The following Lemma is known <ref> [10] </ref>. <p> k jg: Given an American put with strike price L, there exists an integer s 0 such that t s achieves the max in Eq.(8): = (L S 0 u s )E [(1 + r) t s ]: (9) The last expression in (9) can be computed in closed form <ref> [10] </ref>. In the following we as sume that s denotes the non-negative integer of Lemma 12.

The mathematical justification of this model is that the standard symmetric random walk, appropriately scaled, converges to Brownian motion. <p> We thus hope to demonstrate that the field of derivative securities is a rich source of opportunities for computer science research. For more details on option pricing and Arbitrage Pricing Theory, the interested reader is referred to Hull's <ref> [17] </ref> excellent introductory text. However the present article defines all the concepts needed, and will suffice to understand the computational problems involved. Section 1.1 describes the binomial model for stock prices. <p> At each time step, with probability 3 p the stock price goes up by a factor u, and with probability q = 1 p the price goes down by a factor 1=u. The parameters u; p; q; r satisfy (see <ref> [17] </ref>): u &gt; 1; 1=u &lt; 1 + r &lt; u; p = u 1=u ; or equivalently, pu + q=u = 1 + r: (2) We now formalize the model. <p> In the case of simple calls and puts, the payoff at any time depends only on the prevailing stock price, i.e., G k = g (S k ) for some function g. Such options are said to be Markovian, or path-independent. However there are many options that are path-dependent <ref> [14, 17, 19] </ref>. One class of such options we consider in this article are Asian options. <p> we have the following relation between the V 0 for an Asian call and an Asian put: E (A n L) = E (A n L) + E (L A n ) + : This relation is analogous to the put-call parity relation for simple calls and puts (see Hull <ref> [17] </ref>). <p> In this section we first show a general formula bounding the difference between a PMAO and an otherwise identical MAO, and then apply it to the case of American puts. It is not hard to show (see Hull <ref> [17] </ref>) that under the pricing model of this article, it is never optimal to exercise an American call before expiration. An American call is therefore equivalent to a European call and can be priced in O (n) time.

Reference-contexts: The mathematical justification of this model is that the standard symmetric random walk, appropriately scaled, converges to Brownian motion. As in the continuous models, the price of an n-period option is the time-discounted expected value of the future cash-flows over n periods. Even under this model, path-dependent options <ref> [19] </ref> such as Asians and Lookbacks are particularly difficult to value: for such options, the future cash flows depend on the entire stock price path rather than on just the final stock price, and there are 2 n possible paths. <p> In the case of simple calls and puts, the payoff at any time depends only on the prevailing stock price, i.e., G k = g (S k ) for some function g.

Finally, we mention that Arbitrage Pricing Theory depends on the ability to perfectly hedge the option being priced.

An intriguing problem is therefore to develop a satisfactory pricing theory in the presence of transaction costs.
