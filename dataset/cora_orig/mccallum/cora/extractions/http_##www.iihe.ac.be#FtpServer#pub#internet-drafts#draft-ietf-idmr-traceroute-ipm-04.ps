Abstract: This document is an Internet Draft and is in full conformance with all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026. Internet Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts. Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract This draft describes the IGMP multicast traceroute facility. As the deployment of IP multicast has spread, it has become clear that a method for tracing the route that a multicast IP packet takes from a source to a particular receiver is absolutely required. Unlike unicast traceroute, multicast traceroute requires a special packet type and implementation on the part of routers. This specification describes the required functionality.
