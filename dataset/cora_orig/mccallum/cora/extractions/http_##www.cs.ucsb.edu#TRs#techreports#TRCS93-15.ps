Abstract: An interdisciplinary team of computer scientists and EOS earth-science investigators is jointly investigating the concept of a modeling and database system (MDBS). MDBS is intended to support large-scale earth science investigations by complementing EOS-DIS in terms of support for high-level modeling and data management. In particular, MDBS is intended to facilitate the iterative development of scientific models in data-intensive and computationally intensive applications. It is based on a simple characterization of scientific activity and on an advanced data model that together capture the essence of scientific modeling and database activities in terms of large lattices of representational domains and associated transformations that are employed to organize scientific knowledge, data and algorithms. A high-level, declarative modeling and database language (MDBL) that is based on this data model and on four fundamental sets of scientific operations provides support for scientific modeling activities and for easy access to distributed databases of datasets and algorithms. It permits the efficient resuse of code for building new algorithms and supports key aspects of scientific modeling activities, such as lineage and error tracking in datasets, and for the concepts of model and project. We are applying a version of MDBS in order to solve several earth science research problems that have arisen in EOS investigations.

Reference-contexts: We have developed an approach, based on coding theoretic techniques, which provides an efficient and optimal solution for a coordinator-based model, in which a single site acts as the coordinator and identifies all corrupted pages in all the copies <ref> [1] </ref>. In particular, the solution is a decentralized solution with less communication overhead.

Reference-contexts: inconsistencies in the retrieval of data; 3. change propagation: the updating of derived data when the sources are replaced by newer versions; 4. version maintenance and storage optimization. 2.4.3 A Model of Collaboration and Cooperation We have also developed a more advanced model of collaboration and cooperation in scientific databases <ref> [2] </ref>. Several scientists may wish to collaborate together to correctly execute their algorithms concurrently. In particular, a scientist may start working on some raw data and then start using derived data that resulted from another scientist's computations.

Reference-contexts: Since a database can not be properly designed without a clear understanding of the data it will contain, a first goal in our project <ref> [3] </ref> was to formalize the contents and meaning of geographic data.

Reference-contexts: This is because, in general, a scientific database will be shared by a variety of scientists and each of them will have different needs resulting in conflicting requirements for name organization. Recently, such a naming scheme, which provides customization, has been developed for the Prospero project <ref> [4] </ref>. Although this scheme is designed for filesystems, it provides mechanisms to integrate attribute based naming scheme necessary for databases.

Reference-contexts: Although this scheme is designed for filesystems, it provides mechanisms to integrate attribute based naming scheme necessary for databases. In order to implement our ideas concerning database support, we are currently investigating the integration of several available database tools, including the declarative database language CORAL <ref> [5] </ref>, the data management system POSTGRES [6] and the virtual file system PROSPERO, as well as software packages that support scientific modeling and data processing operations.
