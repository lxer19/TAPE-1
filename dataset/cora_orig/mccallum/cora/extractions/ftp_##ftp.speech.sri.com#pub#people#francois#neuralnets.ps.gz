Abstract: This paper describes an application of layered neural networks to nonlinear power systems control. A single generator unit feeds a power line to various users whose power demand can vary over time. As a consequence of load variations, the frequency of the generator changes over time. A feedforward neural network is trained to control the steam admission valve of the turbine that drives the generator, thereby restoring the frequency to its nominal value. Frequency transients are minimized and zero steady-state error is obtained. The same technique is then applied to control a system composed of two single units tied together through a power line. Electric load variations can happen independently in both units. Both neural controllers are trained with the backpropagation-through-time algorithm. Use of a neural network to model the dynamic system is avoided by introducing the Jacobian matrices of the system in the backpropagation chain used in controller training.
