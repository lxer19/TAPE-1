Abstract: A wireless local area network (WLAN) or a cell with quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for various types of traffic is considered. A centralized (i.e., star) network topology is adopted as the topology of a cell which consists of a base station and a number of mobile clients. Dynamic Time Division Duplexed (TDD) transmission is used, and hence, the same frequency channel is time-shared for downlink and uplink transmissions under the dynamic control of the base station. We divide traffic into two classes: class I (real-time) and II (non-real-time). Whenever there is no eligible class-I traffic, class-II traffic is transmitted, while uplink transmissions are controlled with a reservation scheme. Class-I traffic is handled with the framing strategy [1] combined with the admission test for adding new class-I connections. Finally, we present the performance (average delay and throughput) evaluation of the reservation scheme for class-II traffic using both analytical calculations and simulations.

Reference-contexts: As the interest in broadband multimedia communications involving digital audio and video grows, a number of researchers have been looking into ways of providing QoS guarantees in wired point-to-point WANs <ref> [1, 4, 5] </ref> and LANs [6]. In this paper, we consider how to provide QoS guarantees for heterogeneous traffic on a WLAN. The following three types of QoS are considered: (1) maximum packet delivery delay; (2) transmission throughput; and (3) packet loss tolerance. <p> Basically, class-II traffic is transmitted when there is no class-I traffic to be transmitted since it has a lower priority than class I. The framing strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, which was originally proposed as a framework for congestion management in integrated service packet networks, is used with some modifications. The framing strategy is composed of a smoothness traffic model and stop-and-go queueing, and provides both packet-delay bound and guaranteed transmission throughput. <p> We first obtain the average number of the queued downlink messages or uplink requests in the base station service queue which is given by E <ref> [ ^ N 1j ^ N &gt; 1] </ref> = n n ; (26) because ^ N (t)1 corresponds to the number of downlink messages or queued requests in the base station service queue for [E k ; E k+1 ). <p> Now, the queueing delay is given using Little's theorem: D q = E <ref> [ ^ N 1j ^ N &gt; 1] </ref>=G 0 where G 0 new = total = d + R s u for the system to be stable.

But, dynamic TDD allows for more efficient link utilization in the case of unbalanced uplink and downlink traffic, e.g., non-interactive data transmissions, as shown in [9]. We assume all packets, like ATM cells, to be of the same fixed size. <p> Usually, a combined channel coding and diversity scheme <ref> [2] </ref> is used to meet this need. To handle various types of traffic in our system, we can apply error-handling schemes adaptively. We adopt an ARQ (Automatic Retransmission reQuest) scheme for class II to ensure virtually error-free transmission of data. <p> Control packets are used by the base station 1 A cell in this paper refers to a micro-cell, which has coverage of the order of a few hundred meters, or a pico-cell, which covers small indoor areas <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Although combined FEC and diversity seems to be the only way for error-protection of class I, it is extremely difficult to guarantee the virtually error-free transmission of packets of these classes over the wireless link due to the error-correcting capability limit of the underlying FEC scheme.

They are generally characterized as high-speed wireless systems which cover relatively small areas compared to other wireless systems such as cellular, PCS, and mobile data radio systems. <p> In this topology, the uplink (mobile-to-base) is not a broadcast channel while the downlink (base-to-mobile) is. Hence, mobile clients are not able to listen directly to other mobiles using the same frequency channel. This assumed situation can occur in real world due to the existence of hidden terminals <ref> [3] </ref>. The entire wireless network may consist of several cells, and mobile clients may move from one cell to another. However, we will in this paper focus on the communication within a single cell, hence the uplink and downlink transmissions only. <p> For dynamic TDD transmission, the base station needs to multiplex between downlink and uplink transmissions. The base station does not know if a mobile has a pending message without receiving a reservation request. Basically, a reservation slot is issued after 3 Due to the capture effects <ref> [3] </ref>, a reservation request can be transmitted successfully even in the presence of concurrent reservation requests from other mobiles. completing the transmission of a (downlink or uplink) class-II message as shown in Fig. 3, where only class-II traffic (without subclasses) exists.

Reference-contexts: The basic idea of the admission test is the total reserved throughput for class-I connections plus the redundancy of mini-slots should be less than, or equal to, one. The readers are referred to <ref> [10] </ref> for a formal proof. Note that in Example 1, the summation in Eq. (3) is exactly one, implying that all of the slots be reserved for the three class-I connections. It might sometimes be desirable to set aside a certain portion of throughput for class-II traffic (say S).
