It has been shown that static sensitization can underestimate [10] as well as overestimate [6,15]. We will also show now that this is true.

Reference-contexts: While more detailed waveform models capture the actual signal behavior more accurately, their algorithmic implementations are slower. Most existing methods assume a simple waveform model because the delay computation problem is hard even with simple models. Floating mode <ref> [4] </ref>, for example, is a waveform model where only the latest event on every circuit node, namely the node becoming stable, is considered. The value of the node until it stabilizes is assumed to be unknown. <p> Static sensitization [1] and the Brand-Iyengar condition [2] were the earliest PCs proposed in the literature. They were followed by many others including viability [10], oating mode sensitization <ref> [4] </ref>, and the loose criterion [4,5]. However, most studies of these PCs do not consider the underlying waveform model or the causality principle explicitly. The analysis tends to be ad hoc or algorithm driven, and does not reect how events actually propagate. <p> Complex delay models such as the min-max delay model further complicate the analysis. Several types of approximations can be used to simplify the timing analysis problem: Restricting the waveform model. A subset of all possible events is considered. For example, floating mode <ref> [4] </ref> considers only the last event on every circuit node. Restricting the delay model. For example, if a module has many input-output path delays, one can consider only the maximum delay. Simplifying the calculation of PCs. <p> The waveform model resulting from these simplifications is called the W2 model and is depicted in Fig. 4. It is known in the literature as oating mode, and was introduced by Chen and Du <ref> [4] </ref>. In this paper, we consider ignoring the initial values, and derive PCs accordingly. It can be easily shown that the other approximation method yields the same PCs and latest event time (delay). <p> This is shown in Fig. 5 (a). The new PC exactly matches the conditions for oating mode given in <ref> [4] </ref>, thus confirming our analysis. The same operation can also be applied to the lat est event time (delay) to derive , the latest event time for the W2 model. Figure 5 (b) shows the truth table for . <p> - W3 - X X x W 0 W 1 W 2 W 3 W 4 (topological) (static co-sensitization) (oating) X x X x (FALE model) P Qfi P Q Q P d d d d d 8 only consider here viability [10], static sensitization [1] and the loose criterion <ref> [4, 5] </ref>.

Further, as in the case of viability, the latest event time (delay) for the loose criterion is the same as that under the W2 model. We also note that the condition used by VIPER [3] is equivalent to the loose criterion.

Reference-contexts: Floating mode [4], for example, is a waveform model where only the latest event on every circuit node, namely the node becoming stable, is considered. The value of the node until it stabilizes is assumed to be unknown. Transition mode <ref> [6] </ref>, on the other hand, considers all possible events on internal nodes, while the primary inputs are restricted to a single event. Another important aspect of PCs is the role of causality.

Reference-contexts: It is interesting to note that the PC is not the usual static sensitization condition, which is based on the D-algorithm used in test generation It is known in the literature as static co-sensitization and was introduced by Deva das et al. <ref> [7] </ref>. Also shown in the figure are and the latest (abstract) event time derived using Equation (2). <p> The delay estimates of S1, S2 and safe static along with those of W4 (topological), W3 (static co-sensitization), W2 (oating), and static sensitization are shown in Table 1 for the ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits, carry-skip adders, and some examples from <ref> [7] </ref>. As mentioned before, the estimates of S1, S2 and safe static are between those of W2 and W3. For the ISCAS-85 benchmark circuits, S1 and S2 yield the same delay values as W2 except for c1908, where their estimate is equal to the longest topological delay.

Reference-contexts: Timing analysis using the W0 waveform model is complicated for various reasons. First, since arbitrary number of events can occur on circuit nodes, the storage of these events can be a problem. Devadas et al. <ref> [8] </ref> give an example where the number events in y xz y t x t x t x t y t y t z y xz t x t x t y ( ) t x t y ( ) 3 the circuit is exponential in the circuit size.
