Abstract: Discrete affine systems are obtained by applying dilations to a given shift-invariant system. The complicated structure of the affine system is due, first and foremost, to the fact that it is not invariant under shifts. Affine frames carry the additional difficulty that they are "global" in nature: it is the entire interaction between the various dilation levels that determines whether the system is a frame, and not the behaviour of the system within one dilation level. We completely unravel the structure of the affine system with the aid of two new notions: the affine product, and a quasi-affine system. This leads to a characterization of affine frames; the induced characterization of tight affine frames is in terms of exact orthogonality relations that the wavelets should satisfy on the Fourier domain. Several results, such as a general oversampling theorem follow from these characterizations. Most importantly, the affine product can be factored during a multiresolution analysis construction, and this leads to a complete characterization of all tight frames that can be constructed by such methods. Moreover, this characterization suggests very simple sufficient conditions for constructing tight frames from multiresolution. Of particular importance are the facts that the underlying scaling function does not need to satisfy any a priori conditions, and that the freedom offered by redundancy can be fully exploited in these constructions.

The function t is the refinement mask, and the other t 's are the wavelet masks.

Reference-contexts: We now turn our attention to orthonormal systems. First, it is easy to conclude (say, from the analysis of <ref> [BDR2] </ref>) that for X constructed from a PSI multiresolution to be orthonormal, it is necessary that we do not have more than j det sj 1 wavelets. Second, Corollary 5.8 characterizes all fundamental tight frames that are orthonormal.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the above-detailed construction of tight affine frames is of particular interest since it covers cases when is a "bad" generator of V 0 . In fact, affine frames constructed by MRA from a frame E () are already analysed in the present literature; cf. [LC] and <ref> [BL] </ref>. Theorem 1.7 does not characterize all tight frames constructed by multiresolution. However, such characterization is possible, and is given in Theorem 6.5. Finally, the following result (which is a special case of Corollary 6.9) concerns the construction of orthonormal systems: Corollary 1.8. Assume that is a square matrix.

More generally, let M be the left-hand-side of (4.18), and let be the determinant of (any basis for) M; also, let a := det s, l := det L 1 . <p> Oversampling, continued. We continue the analysis of the oversampling procedure that was outlined in x4.3. We now assume that the oversampling L is the inverse s 1 of the dilation matrix s. This, of course, violates condition (4.18). Indeed, as is pointed out in <ref> [CS3] </ref>, the oversampling of the univariate dyadic orthonormal Haar system by 2 does not yield a tight frame.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we conclude that T fl 0 vanishes on ran T 0 , and the result now easily follows. There are examples (some can be constructed based on the biorthogonal wavelets obtained in <ref> [CDF] </ref>) of an affine system X whose corresponding truncated system X 0 is a frame, for which, nonetheless, ran T is not the orthogonal sum n2ZZ ran T X n nX n1 .

Reference-contexts: In addition, several (seemingly unrelated and none related to MRA) observations now in the literature may be explained and thereby generalized, with the aid of the results here. To mention few examples, Daubechies-Tchamitchian's upper frame bound estimate, <ref> [D1] </ref>, is closely related to the bounding the ` 2 -norm of a self-adjoint matrix by its ` 1 -norm, while their lower frame bound estimate corresponds to inverse-norm estimates of a diagonally dominant matrix. <p> Note that the diagonal entries of the dual Gramian matrices have the form (1:6) [!; !] = 2 k=1 Thus, known estimates for the frames bounds in terms of this expression <ref> [D1] </ref>, [CS1], [CS2] and [CS3], can be accurately viewed as an estimation of the norm and the inverse norm of a non-negative definite matrix via the inspection of its diagonal entries.

Reference-contexts: constitutes a major breakthrough in the understanding of affine systems, and even more importantly, for the construction of such systems, some of which seem to be inaccessible without this machinery (with the primary example being the univariate construction of compactly supported orthonormal affine systems with arbitrary smoothness by Daubechies in <ref> [D2] </ref>). However, the current MRA theory suffers in several important aspects. Firstly, its main body consists of sufficient conditions for obtaining "good" systems, and not of characterizations of such systems. Furthermore, the typical assumptions begin with the imposition of stringent conditions on the refinable space.

Then, the tight frame constructed in Theorem 1.7 is orthonormal if and only if kk = 1. 6 The standard current argument for constructing an orthonormal affine system from multireso--lution, assumes that the shifts of the scaling function are orthonormal (cf. <ref> [D3] </ref>), which forces t to be CQF.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction 1.1. General The present paper is the last in a series of three, all devoted to the study of shift-invariant frames and shift-invariant stable (=Riesz) bases for L 2 (IR d ), d 1, or a subspace of it. In the first paper, <ref> [RS1] </ref>, we studied such bases under the mere assumption that the basis set can be written as a collection of shifts (namely, integer translates) of a set of generators . The second paper [RS2] analyses the Weyl-Heisenberg frames and Riesz bases. <p> The second paper [RS2] analyses the Weyl-Heisenberg frames and Riesz bases. In the present paper, we study applications of the results of <ref> [RS1] </ref> to wavelet (or affine) frames. Wavelet systems are not shift-invariant, hence the basic analysis of [RS1] cannot be directly applied to this case. Our original intent was to write a paper on affine Riesz bases and affine frames. The present paper, however, is devoted solely to fundamental affine frames. <p> The second paper [RS2] analyses the Weyl-Heisenberg frames and Riesz bases. In the present paper, we study applications of the results of <ref> [RS1] </ref> to wavelet (or affine) frames. Wavelet systems are not shift-invariant, hence the basic analysis of [RS1] cannot be directly applied to this case. Our original intent was to write a paper on affine Riesz bases and affine frames. The present paper, however, is devoted solely to fundamental affine frames. The primary reason is that the fiberization techniques of [RS1] allowed us to unravel completely the complicated <p> not shift-invariant, hence the basic analysis of <ref> [RS1] </ref> cannot be directly applied to this case. Our original intent was to write a paper on affine Riesz bases and affine frames. The present paper, however, is devoted solely to fundamental affine frames. The primary reason is that the fiberization techniques of [RS1] allowed us to unravel completely the complicated structure of the analysis operator (or more precisely, of the so-called "frame operator") of an affine system, with less success with respect to the relevant synthesis operator. <p> Finally, we set, for r 0, H r := ff 2 L 2 : j supp b f " [r; r]j = 0g: Since the system X is not shift-invariant, and since our fiberization techniques from <ref> [RS1] </ref> assume this shift-invariance at their outset, we analyse X by associating it with two different shift-invariant systems. The first, and simpler one, is the truncated affine system X 0 , obtained by simply removing from X the non-shift-invariant part, i.e., the part generated by negative dilations. <p> In particular, the affine system is tight if and only if the quasi-affine system is tight. We then analyse the affine system X via the so-called "dual Gramian" fibers, e G (!), ! 2 IR d (which may be only almost everywhere defined) of the shift-invariant X q , <ref> [RS1] </ref>. <p> It is understood that G fl (!) := 1 whenever e G (!) does not represent a bounded operator, and a similar remark applies to G fl (!). We then conclude from Theorem 1.1 and the results of <ref> [RS1] </ref> the following: Theorem 1.2. Let X be an affine system generated by . Let G fl and G fl be the dual Gramian norm functions defined as above. Then X is a fundamental frame if and only if G fl ; G fl 2 L 1 . <p> In fact, if, e.g., b vanishes on a null-set only (as is the case when is a compactly supported, or an exponentially decaying function), then E () cannot be a redundant frame (see <ref> [RS1] </ref>). It follows then, in case the CQF mask of the refinable is finite, E () is a frame only when it is orthonormal. Hence, the above-detailed construction of tight affine frames is of particular interest since it covers cases when is a "bad" generator of V 0 . <p> Layout of the paper The rest of the paper is laid out as follows. In x2 we briefly discuss frames and affine systems in L 2 , and in x3 present relevant material from <ref> [RS1] </ref>. In x4 we discuss the relations between an affine system and its truncated affine system. The core of our analysis is in x5, where quasi-affine systems are studied, and where the results of x4 are applied to yield Theorem 1.1 in its general form. <p> The default lattice is always ZZ d . In <ref> [RS1] </ref>, it was showed that the synthesis and analysis operators of any shift-invariant X can be decomposed, on the frequency domain, into a collection of constant coefficient (usually infinite-order) matrices, "fibers", termed there the pre-Gramian, Gramian, and dual Gramian. <p> Notations: bracket products. The following bracket product plays a key role in the theory of shift-invariant systems (cf. e.g., [JM], [BDR1,2], <ref> [RS1] </ref>): (2:6) [f; g] := j22ZZ d Among other things, we will require the following elementary fact that follows from Parseval's identity: (2:7) kT fl In this paper, we introduce another important bracket product: the affine (or dual) bracket product. <p> Preliminaries: dual Gramian fiberization of shift-invariant systems Given a shift-invariant system E (), L 2 , three matrices, the pre-Gramian, the Gramian and the dual Gramian appear in our fiberization approach in <ref> [RS1] </ref>. The most relevant to the present context is the dual Gramian, which is a decomposition, on the Fourier domain, of the operator T T fl , and is a collection e G (!), ! 2 IR d , of non-negative definite self-adjoint matrices. <p> Corollary 3.2.2, Theorem 3.3.5, and Theorem 3.4.1 of <ref> [RS1] </ref>). Theorem 3.1. Let X be a system that consists of the shifts of some L 2 , with a dual Gramian e G. <p> From the dual Gramian representation as detailed in <ref> [RS1] </ref>, we easily conclude that the assumption f 2 H r renders all ff-rows and ff-columns of the dual Gramian e G 0 (!) (viewed, say, as a quadratic form) inactive, in the case j! + ffj r. <p> This, however, cannot be carried over, and need not be carried over to the frame constructions. Cannot, since there are intrinsic limitations here. For example, <ref> [RS1] </ref> shows that the only way to obtain redundant frames of the form E (), finite and compactly supported, is by adding redundant generators to a shift-invariant Riesz basis E ( 0 ).

Reference-contexts: In the first paper, [RS1], we studied such bases under the mere assumption that the basis set can be written as a collection of shifts (namely, integer translates) of a set of generators . The second paper <ref> [RS2] </ref> analyses the Weyl-Heisenberg frames and Riesz bases. In the present paper, we study applications of the results of [RS1] to wavelet (or affine) frames. Wavelet systems are not shift-invariant, hence the basic analysis of [RS1] cannot be directly applied to this case.
