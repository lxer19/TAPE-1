Reference-contexts: Our study is an outgrowth of the quest for an efficient implementation of the 1-Steiner heuristic [13], which affords a particularly effective approximation to a rectilinear Steiner minimal tree (within 0:5% of optimal for typical input pointsets) [16], and where the central time-consuming loop depends on the maximum MST degree <ref> [1] </ref> [2]. Our results also have practical utility in new three-dimensional VLSI technologies [10]. The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 establishes the terminology and relates the MST degree to the Hadwiger and MST numbers (the central result is Theorem 4).

Reference-contexts: The Hadwiger number H (B) of an open convex set B is the maximum number of neighbors of B considered over all packings of translates of B. There is a vast literature on Hadwiger numbers (e.g., Fejes Toth [5], Croft et al. <ref> [3] </ref>). Most results address the plane, but there are several results for higher dimensions.

Reference-contexts: We show that the maximum degree of a maximum-degree MST under the L p metric is related to the so-called Hadwiger number of the corresponding L p unit ball. The relation between MST degree and the packing of convex sets has not been elucidated before, though Day and Edelsbrunner <ref> [4] </ref> studied the "attractive power" of a point, a topic closely related to the MST degree. For general dimension we give exponential lower bounds on the Hadwiger number and maximum MST degree.

Most results address the plane, but there are several results for higher dimensions. <p> In particular, if S is a convex set in &lt; k , the Hadwiger number H (S) satisfies k 2 + k H (S) 3 k 1: It is known that the regular k-simplex realizes the lower bound and the k-hypercube realizes the upper bound <ref> [5] </ref>. Tighter bounds are known for k-hyperspheres; Wyner [17] showed that the Hadwiger number for spheres is at least 2 0:207k (1+o (1)) , and Kabatjansky and Levenste in [12] showed that it is at most 2 0:401k (1+o (1)) .

Substituting for c gives the result. 4 Arbitrary L p Metrics In this section, we provide bounds on M (k; p) for general L p metrics. <p> The number of vertices chosen must exceed 2 k =d (J).

Note that ff = 1 2 p , so d (J) p Theorem 11 shows that for any fixed p &gt; 1, ^-(k; p) grows exponentially in the dimension.

Only four Hadwiger numbers for spheres are known exactly; these are the numbers in dimensions 2, 3, 8, and 24. The three-dimensional Hadwiger number has a history dating back to Newton and was only determined much later.

Reference-contexts: Finding a BDMST of maximum degree D = 2 is equivalent to solving the traveling salesman problem, which is known to be NP-hard [6]. Papadimitriou and Vazirani have shown that that the problem of finding a Euclidean BDMST with D = 3 is also NP-hard <ref> [14] </ref>. On the other hand, they also note that a BDMST with D = 5 in the Euclidean plane is actually a Euclidean MST and can therefore be found in polynomial time. The 1 complexity of the BDMST problem when D = 4 remained open. <p> It turns out 8 that the D = 3 question is also NP-complete, using a proof identical to the one appearing in Papadimitriou and Vazirani <ref> [14] </ref>. Their result is for the corresponding Euclidean problem, but they restrict all their points to being on a special type of grid graph, and the proof holds in the rectilinear metric as well.

Reference-contexts: We settle this issue under the rectilinear metric: we show that the rectilinear BDMST problem with D = 3 is NP-hard, but that the rectilinear D = 4 case is solvable in polynomial time. The rectilinear metric is common in VLSI applications <ref> [15] </ref>, and has thus been studied by, e.g., Ho, Vijayan, and Wong, who proved that an MST in the rectilinear plane must have maximum degree of D 8, and state (without proof) that the maximum degree bound may be improved to D 6 [11].
