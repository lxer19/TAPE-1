Title: A Reliable Multicast Framework for Light-weight Sessions and Application Level Framing  
Author: Sally Floyd, Van Jacobson, Ching-Gung Liu, Steven McCanne, and Lixia Zhang 
Date: December 1997  
Note: to appear in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,  
Abstract: This paper 1 describes SRM (Scalable Reliable Multicast), a reliable multicast framework for light-weight sessions and application level framing. The algorithms of this framework are efficient, robust, and scale well to both very large networks and very large sessions. The SRM framework has been prototyped in wb, a distributed whiteboard application, which has been used on a global scale with sessions ranging from a few to a few hundred participants. The paper describes the principles that have guided the SRM design, including the IP multicast group delivery model, an end-to-end, receiver-based model of reliability, and the application level framing protocol model. As with unicast communications, the performance of a reliable multicast delivery algorithm depends on the underlying topology and operational environment. We investigate that dependence via analysis and simulation, and demonstrate an adaptive algorithm that uses the results of previous loss recovery events to adapt the control parameters used for future loss recovery. With the adaptive algorithm, our reliable multicast delivery algorithm provides good performance over a wide range of underlying topologies.

Reference-contexts: Ordering is further complicated by disagreements about how the ordering itself should be defined: Cheriton and Skeen [5] have argued (and Birman <ref> [1] </ref> has rebutted) that for applications with ordering requirements, preserving the ordering of messages as they appear in the network can be an expensive and inadequate substitute for preserving the "semantic ordering" of the messages appropriate for the application.

Reference-contexts: There is also a growing literature on the analysis of reliable multicast schemes. As one example, Bhagwat, Mishra, and Tripathi <ref> [4] </ref> consider the performance of one-to-many reliable multicast with a block-based ACK scheme. The paper investigates the regime where transfer sizes are large, receivers have limited buffering, and all retransmissions come from the original sender. Pejhan, Schwartz, and Anastassiou [31] compare several retransmission schemes for multicast protocols for real-time media.

Reference-contexts: The weakness of "one size fits all" protocols has long been recognized. In 1990 Clark and Tennenhouse proposed a new protocol model called Application Level Framing (ALF) which explicitly includes an application's semantics in the design of that application's protocol <ref> [6] </ref>. ALF was later elaborated with a light-weight rendezvous mechanism based on the IP multicast distribution model, and with a notion of receiver-based adaptation for unreliable, real-time applications such as audio and video conferencing. <p> Thus the "naming in application data units (ADUs)" model works far better for multicast. Use of this model also has two beneficial side effects. As Clark and Tennenhouse <ref> [6] </ref> point out, a separate protocol namespace can impose delays and inefficiencies on an application, e.g., TCP will only deliver data in sequence even though a file transfer application might be perfectly happy to receive sectors in any order.

Reference-contexts: Because of the "fate-sharing" implicit in unicast communication, i.e., the data transmission fails if either of the two ends fails, either the sender or receiver can take on this role. In TCP, the sender times transmissions and keeps retransmitting until an acknowledgment is received. NETBLT <ref> [7] </ref> uses the opposite model and makes the receiver responsible for all loss detection and recovery. Both approaches have been shown to work well for unicast. However, if a TCP-style, sender-based approach is applied to multicast distribution, a number of problems occur.

Reference-contexts: SRM is also heavily based on the group delivery model that is the centerpiece of the IP multicast protocol <ref> [8] </ref>. In IP multicast, data sources simply send to the group's mul-ticast address (a normal IP address chosen from a reserved range of addresses) without needing any advance knowledge of the group membership.

Reference-contexts: Both approaches have been shown to work well for unicast. However, if a TCP-style, sender-based approach is applied to multicast distribution, a number of problems occur. First, because data packets trigger acknowledgments (positive or negative) from all the receivers, the sender is subject to the well-known ACK implosion effect <ref> [10] </ref>. Also, if the sender is responsible for reliable delivery, it must continuously track the changing set of active receivers and the reception state of each. <p> Section 5 explores in more detail the number of requests and repairs in different topologies. 3.1 Session messages In SRM, each member multicasts periodic session messages that report the sequence number state for active sources. Session messages for reliable multicast <ref> [10] </ref> have been previously proposed to enable receivers to detect the loss of the last packet in a burst, and to enable the sender to monitor the status of receivers. Members can also use session messages in SRM to determine the current participants of the session.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the larger the multicast group, the more likely it is that a packet will be dropped somewhere along the multicast tree, even in the absence of a particular persistent point of congestion. Forward Error Correction (FEC) [29] and Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <ref> [11] </ref> both have great potential for reducing the negative impacts of transient or mild congestion for reliable multicast applications. However, links with persistent congestion and persistent packet drops are likely to remain.

Reference-contexts: RMTP uses windowed flow control tuned to the requirements of the worst-case receiver. The problem of dynamically choosing DRs for a given multicast tree is left for continued research.

Reference-contexts: Several proposals for reliable multicast use secondary servers (also called Designated Routers or Group Controllers in different proposals), to handle retransmissions within a subgroup of the multicast group. One such protocol, Log-based Receiver-reliable Multicast (LBRM) <ref> [15] </ref>, was designed to support Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS). The receiver-based reliability is provided by primary and secondary logging servers. Receivers request retransmis-sions from the secondary logging servers, which requests retransmissions from the primary logging server. <p> In many topologies, the effectiveness of local recovery could be improved by adding members to the multicast group in strategic locations. For example, consider the known stable topologies discussed in <ref> [15] </ref>, where losses are expected to occur mainly on the tail circuits, rather than in the backbone or in the LANs, and the design priority is to keep unnecessary traffic off of the tail circuits.

Reference-contexts: This allows applications using the SRM framework to adapt to a wide range of group sizes, topologies and link bandwidths while maintaining robust and high performance. Wb, the distributed whiteboard tool designed and implemented by McCanne and Jacobson <ref> [17, 23] </ref>, is the first application based on the SRM framework.

Reference-contexts: These can be combined with normal Internet privacy mechanisms (e.g., symmetric-key encryption of all the wb data) to limit participation to a particular group and/or with normal authentication mechanisms (e.g., participants signing their drawing operations via public-key encryption of a cryptographic hash over the data) <ref> [24, 18] </ref>. Each member is identified by a globally unique identifier, the Source-ID, and each page is identified by a Page-ID consisting of the Source-ID of the initiator of the page and a page number locally unique to that initiator.

Reference-contexts: ALF was later elaborated with a light-weight rendezvous mechanism based on the IP multicast distribution model, and with a notion of receiver-based adaptation for unreliable, real-time applications such as audio and video conferencing. The result, known as Light-Weight Sessions (LWS) <ref> [19] </ref>, has been very successful in the design of wide-area, large-scale, conferencing applications.

Reference-contexts: The multicast group must include some member capable of sending repairs. This mechanism is appropriate when there is a stable loss neighborhood that results from a particular lossy link, or when an isolated member joins a group late and asks for past history. Kasera, Kurose, and Towsley <ref> [20] </ref> explore a somewhat-different use of multiple multicast groups for recovery aimed primarily at reducing the costs of processing unwanted packets at receivers. 7.2.3 TTL-based scoping A third possible mechanism for local recovery is for members to use time-to-live- or TTL-based scope to limit the reach of request and repair messages.

Reference-contexts: Like LBRM and SRM, the Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol (RMTP) <ref> [21] </ref> also includes among its goals scalability and receiver-based reliability. RMTP accomplishes this by using Designated Routers (DRs) in each region of the multicast group, where the DRs receive incoming ac-knowledgements and perform retransmissions as needed. RMTP uses windowed flow control tuned to the requirements of the worst-case receiver.

Reference-contexts: This is most likely to be of use for larger administratively-scoped neighborhoods. 7.2.2 Separate multicast groups Another potential mechanism under investigation is the use of separate multicast groups for local recovery <ref> [22] </ref>. In this scheme, the initial requestor creates a separate multicast group for local recovery and invites other nearby members to join that multicast group. The multicast group must include some member capable of sending repairs.

The paper investigates the regime where transfer sizes are large, receivers have limited buffering, and all retransmissions come from the original sender. Pejhan, Schwartz, and Anastassiou <ref> [31] </ref> compare several retransmission schemes for multicast protocols for real-time media. The retransmission schemes are intended for real-time media with playback times, so that packets received after the playback time are dropped. They assume that 17 receivers unicast NACKs to the sender, and retransmis--sions are done by the sender.

Reference-contexts: The average bandwidth consumed by session messages is limited to a small fraction (e.g., 5%) of the aggregate data bandwidth, whether pre-allocated by a reservation protocol or measured adaptively by a congestion control algorithm. SRM members use the algorithm developed for vat and described in <ref> [32] </ref> for dynamically adjusting the generation rate of session messages in proportion to the multicast group size. In a large, long-lived session, the state would become unmanageable if each receiver had to report the sequence numbers of everyone who had ever sent data to the group. <p> However, this limitation resulted from our lack of prior experience with ALF-based design and we argue now that an ALF protocol architecture does not necessarily preclude substantial code re-use. Based on our subsequent experience with another ALF architecture | the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) <ref> [32] </ref> that underlies the MBone tools vic and vat | we know that the core of an ALF based design can be easily tailored for a range of application types.

Reference-contexts: Since members of a multicast group have different communication paths and may come and go at any time, the "fate-shared" coupling of sender and receiver in unicast transmissions does not generalize to multicast. Thus it is clear that receiver-based reliability is a far better building block for reliable multicast <ref> [33] </ref>. Another unicast convention that migrates poorly to mul-ticast has to do with the vocabulary used by the sender and receiver (s) to describe the progress of their communication.

Reference-contexts: For larger groups, we are investigating a hierarchical approach for scalable session messages <ref> [35] </ref>, where members in a local area dynamically select one of the local members to be the representative, as far as session messages are concerned. The representatives would each send global session messages, and maintain an estimate of their distance in seconds from each of the other representatives.

In XTP receivers or routers can impose a maximum data rate and maximum burst size on the sender.

The next section considers large networks with nodes of degree four, where only a fraction of the nodes are members of the multicast group.

Reference-contexts: Scenarios that could benefit from local recovery include sessions with persistent losses to a small neighborhood of members and isolated late arrivals to a multicast session asking for back history. Studies of packet loss patterns in the current Mbone <ref> [39] </ref> suggest that packet loss in multi-cast traffic is most likely to occur not in the "backbone" but in the "edges" of the multicast network.
