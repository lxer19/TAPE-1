Abstract: ALLONS-D is a decentralized real-time traffic control scheme. A description of its basic architecture, system model, and optimization algorithm is given. Through simulations, the scheme is shown to be suitable for adaptive control of an isolated intersection. An efficient tree searching algorithm is used to find a traffic signal plan that minimizes delay. The search is constrained only by maximum and minimum green times per phase. This algorithm is free to consider cyclic and non-cyclic signal plans alike. The rolling horizon concept is used for the calculation and implementation of optimal signal plans. The ALLONS-D scheme has several key differences with other real-time traffic control schemes, such as OPAC. Extensive simulation experiments on a single intersection indicate the success of the ALLONS-D scheme versus any fixed-cycle plan. The tests included a full range of uniform and non-uniform demands from low levels of saturation to the over-saturated case. For arterial networks of intersections, the scheme is shown to be capable of inducing a level of coordination that results in progressive signal plans. In particular, the scheme can be used to coordinate travel times on transit routes. An extension of the scheme to provide network-wide optimization of traffic signals is explained in the form of a two-layer scheme. Some preliminary results using this approach are included. Simulation experiments are performed with a newly developed traffic simulator called STNS.

Reference-contexts: Active priority systems allow a bus driver (or other transit operator) to command a nearby traffic light directly. The use of active priority may induce additional traffic delay that outweighs any benefit achieved by prioritizing a high occupancy vehicle. Hence, these systems, although being implemented in several cities <ref> [Ins, 1994, Ame, 1994] </ref>, are considered controversial. Passive priority systems seek to weight the importance of a transit vehicle when considering possible signal plans. They are intelligent priority systems that consider the benefits and effects of giving a vehicle priority.

Reference-contexts: These constraints are in the interests of safety and fairness, respectively. ALLONS-D can consider additional priority for vehicles of different types or occupancy levels in the traffic stream. Rolling Horizon, as a strategy for on-line signal control, has been studied by several transportation researchers <ref> [Bell and Brookes, 1994] </ref>. It is a strategy utilized in other tested traffic control schemes such as OPAC [Gartner, 1983b, Gartner, 1983a], PRODYN [Henry et al., 1983], and UTOPIA [Mauro and DiTaranto, 1990, Mauro, 1991]. This paper discusses some of the distinguishing features of ALLONS-D relative to these other methods. <p> The difficulty in accurately forecasting vehicle arrivals for any lengthy segment (or horizon) of time influences the desire for a rolling horizon implementation of these schemes. Recent studies have shown that short roll periods are sufficient <ref> [Bell and Brookes, 1994] </ref>. How the horizon is chosen and set is a key distinguishing characteristic between various plans of this type. For example, the horizon could be a preset, fixed time period, or it could be variable in some way.

Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION There are various levels of sophistication in traffic signal control systems; quoting from <ref> [DOT, 1996] </ref>: "Current state-of-the-art traffic signal control systems have the capability to dynamically modify the signal timings in response to changing traffic demand and to coordinate operation between adjacent signals to maximize the roadway (network) throughput. . . .

Reference-contexts: Clearly, our problem is a shortest path problem in the decision network. Dynamic programming (DP) is an optimization procedure that would seem to be well suited to our application. DP, in general, is applicable to problems requiring a sequence of interrelated decisions <ref> [Dreyfus and Law, 1977] </ref>. Given a network, it is computationally much more efficient than a brute-force enumeration and comparison of all possible paths. Robertson and Bretherton [Robertson and Bretherton, 1974] describe a backwards DP formulation which determines the optimal signal plan using predictions of queue lengths for a fixed-horizon.

Reference-contexts: Essentially, the use of weights for certain phases at the intersections of a network is utilized as a tool. The purpose is to coordinate the control action of the individual controllers at the intersections in an effort to improve the network-wide performance. As described for a similar problem in <ref> [Fernandez and Friesz, 1983] </ref>, this coincides with a concept from welfare economics: decentralized control to optimize local objectives leads to optimization of global objectives if the externalities are internalized. Along these lines, the weights factor in the global effect of any local decision.

Reference-contexts: The length of the horizon in ALLONS affects the computational complexity and is determined by the geometry of the intersection and the arrivals into the intersections. A shorter horizon, with all other parameters fixed, reduces computational complexity. Thus, the work of Garcia and Smith <ref> [Garcia and Smith, 1997] </ref> is relevant; it addresses the issue of determining a minimal planning horizon to ensure that the first decision is optimal.

Reference-contexts: Rolling Horizon, as a strategy for on-line signal control, has been studied by several transportation researchers [Bell and Brookes, 1994]. It is a strategy utilized in other tested traffic control schemes such as OPAC <ref> [Gartner, 1983b, Gartner, 1983a] </ref>, PRODYN [Henry et al., 1983], and UTOPIA [Mauro and DiTaranto, 1990, Mauro, 1991]. This paper discusses some of the distinguishing features of ALLONS-D relative to these other methods. <p> Calculating delay is complex. In OPAC, the number of cars in a queue multiplied by the interval of time in which the cars were queued is considered the cost to be optimized <ref> [Gartner, 1983a] </ref>. In ALLONS-D, the sum of the weighted time delay for each vehicle is considered. This allows increased priority to vehicles of a certain type or occupancy by increasing the potential delay that these vehicles may contribute if slowed or stopped.

Reference-contexts: In the ALLONS-D scheme, the horizon is finite and tractable and thus the investigation of a stopping rule as suggested by Garcia and Smith is not considered here. DISCUSSION: COMPARISON TO A fl The A fl algorithm initially proposed in <ref> [Hart et al., 1975] </ref> can be used to solve the shortest path problem in a network. The algorithm relies on obtaining an estimate of the "cost-to-go" (h (n)), i.e., a cost to reach the end node from the current node n. The ALLONS algorithm computes the optimal policy.

This paper discusses some of the distinguishing features of ALLONS-D relative to these other methods.

Thus we are motivated to provide a comparison of the ALLONS-D optimal search procedure to a standard forward dynamic programming approach.

Reference-contexts: Public transportation is ideally a more efficient mode of transportation. It is rationalized that this fact makes busses worthy of priority at signal controlled junctions. This concept is referred to as bus priority or Transit Signal Priority (TSP) <ref> [Ins, 1994] </ref>. Bus priority systems allow an equipped bus to extend a green light or override a red light. Such rationalization may lead to a proliferation of traffic-transit control systems that allow overrides of a traffic signal. <p> Active priority systems allow a bus driver (or other transit operator) to command a nearby traffic light directly. The use of active priority may induce additional traffic delay that outweighs any benefit achieved by prioritizing a high occupancy vehicle. Hence, these systems, although being implemented in several cities <ref> [Ins, 1994, Ame, 1994] </ref>, are considered controversial. Passive priority systems seek to weight the importance of a transit vehicle when considering possible signal plans. They are intelligent priority systems that consider the benefits and effects of giving a vehicle priority.

Reference-contexts: The optimization algorithm of ALLONS, in combination with a rolling horizon implementation, suggests the relevance of the minimum first arc problem that is considered by Lark, White, and Syverson <ref> [Lark et al., 1995] </ref>. ALLONS is not limited to implementing only the first decision of an optimal policy before rolling. <p> The computational speed of the existing algorithm is sufficient. Hence, this approach was not pursued. However, to pursue the approach described in <ref> [Lark et al., 1995] </ref>, the appropriate heuristic function h (n) that would be required is not obvious for the signal control problem described in this paper .

Reference-contexts: Its objective is to minimize the total delay experienced by traffic at each intersection in a given network. The primary feature distinguishing ALLONS-D from schemes such as SCOOT [Robertson and Bretherton, 1991] and SCATS <ref> [Lowrie, 1992, Sims, 1979] </ref> is that it is not constrained to generate cyclic signal plans. Any arbitrary phase sequencing and phase splits are permitted subject only to constraints of a minimum green time and a maximum green time for each phase.

Reference-contexts: The queue lengths and arrival information required by the optimizer could be made available in one of several ways: by upstream detectors located on all approaches to the intersection, by a combination of upstream and downstream detectors, or via surveillance cameras like AUTOSCOPE <ref> [Michalopoulos, 1991] </ref>. The intersection controller requires knowledge of the exact time at which the vehicle arrives at the end of the link and the queue that the arrivals join upon reaching the intersection.

Reference-contexts: It is also impractical to compare different schemes in a real-world setting. Testing via simulation is used here as a practical, albeit less realistic, alternative. For the purposes of this research, we developed an open, uncomplicated and simple traffic network simulator that we call STNS <ref> [Murad and Lafortune, 1995] </ref>. STNS is a mesoscopic simulator; individual vehicles are accounted for but travel times for a link are determined by an impedance function that considers link occupancy. The impedance function used is similar to a dynamic BPR function. <p> These reflect the current state of ALLONS-D as summarized in [Porche et al., 1996]. Finally, we gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Yawar Murad towards the expansion of SITA into the network simulator STNS <ref> [Murad and Lafortune, 1995] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The SPOT controller utilizes the rolling horizon implementation strategy with a roll period of 120 seconds and implementing the first six seconds of calculated signal plans. The area level controller provides weights for the cost functions for each of the SPOT intersection controllers <ref> [Nelson et al., 1993] </ref>. Weights are selected based on macroscopic flow considerations, movement of transit vehicles, data gathered from local controllers, and other considerations. In general, the weights are used to establish preferred routes in the network. <p> Goals of such systems include allowing a bus that is perhaps behind schedule to save time, reducing overall delay along transit routes, and thus improving consistency on routes. For an overview of some existing systems, the reader is referred to <ref> [Nelson et al., 1993] </ref> and [Yagar, 1993]. Bus Priority Systems can be categorized into two types: active priority and passive priority. Active priority systems allow a bus driver (or other transit operator) to command a nearby traffic light directly.

Reference-contexts: Nonetheless, a modified reaching algorithm to solve a forward DP problem is considered. (It is similar to a forward DP strategy proposed by Park et. al. <ref> [Park et al., 1998] </ref>.) This modified algorithm, which incorporates the STLC concept and its pruning mechanism, is demonstrated to be less efficient in some examples than the ALLONS algorithm.

Reference-contexts: The search essentially uses a branch and bound technique and is done in two parts. The first part is a depth-first search to find an initial path in the tree. The second part is a backtracking <ref> [Pearl, 1984] </ref> procedure. Specifically, the tree is searched by continuously exploring nodes at increasing depths until an end node is reached. An end node is a state where the stopping criterion is met. This is equivalent to having all anticipated arriving vehicles on each link cleared from the intersection.

Reference-contexts: These initial concepts were extensively studied on a single intersection using a specially designed simulator called SITA (Single Intersection Test of ALLONS-D). The results from these tests, which were reported in <ref> [Porche and Lafortune, 1995] </ref>, led to a significant redesign of most of the major building blocks of ALLONS-D, including the search procedure, calculation of delay, decision tree state vector, and objective function (to support transit priorities and signal coordination); the main features of the new design were first reported in [Porche <p> <ref> [Porche and Lafortune, 1995] </ref>, led to a significant redesign of most of the major building blocks of ALLONS-D, including the search procedure, calculation of delay, decision tree state vector, and objective function (to support transit priorities and signal coordination); the main features of the new design were first reported in [Porche and Lafortune, 1995].

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, we explored the concept of providing network wide optimization for arterial networks using decentralized, adaptive controllers. Our recent work reported in <ref> [Porche and Lafortune, 1998] </ref> includes the development of general rules for inducing network wide optimal behavior from decentralized controllers on arterial networks. We emphasize that the search algorithm employed by ALLONS-D is guaranteed to return an optimal solution for the decision tree and objective function under consideration.

Reference-contexts: Finally, some general comments on ALLONS-D, including the issue of computational speed, conclude the paper. We note that a brief description of the main features of the ALLONS-D scheme was given in the conference publication <ref> [Porche et al., 1996] </ref>. DESCRIPTION OF ALLONS-D A description of the basic architecture of ALLONS-D is provided at the beginning of this section. We then describe the decision tree used for optimization and the states in the tree as part of a presentation of the system model. <p> These reflect the current state of ALLONS-D as summarized in <ref> [Porche et al., 1996] </ref>. Finally, we gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Yawar Murad towards the expansion of SITA into the network simulator STNS [Murad and Lafortune, 1995].

Reference-contexts: The concept is to use L i (t) to weight the objective function used by ALLONS-D. The process to develop these weights is not discussed here (see Chapter 3 of <ref> [Porche, 1998] </ref> for a detailed study of this problem). We show that for an arterial network, system performance is improved when compared to unbiased (i.e., with unity weights for all phases) decentralized controllers.

Given a network, it is computationally much more efficient than a brute-force enumeration and comparison of all possible paths. Robertson and Bretherton <ref> [Robertson and Bretherton, 1974] </ref> describe a backwards DP formulation which determines the optimal signal plan using predictions of queue lengths for a fixed-horizon. In comparison, ALLONS-D uses a depth first branch-and-bound (DFBB) algorithm with STLC branch ordering (which steps forward in time).

Reference-contexts: Its objective is to minimize the total delay experienced by traffic at each intersection in a given network. The primary feature distinguishing ALLONS-D from schemes such as SCOOT <ref> [Robertson and Bretherton, 1991] </ref> and SCATS [Lowrie, 1992, Sims, 1979] is that it is not constrained to generate cyclic signal plans. Any arbitrary phase sequencing and phase splits are permitted subject only to constraints of a minimum green time and a maximum green time for each phase.

Reference-contexts: The systems SCATS and SCOOT are prime examples. The SCOOT (Split, Cycle and Offset Optimizer) system attempts an incremental optimization of cycle time, phase split, and offset, and it is based on a platoon dispersion and queue profile traffic model similar to that of the off-line scheme TRANSYT <ref> [Robertson and Hunt, 1982] </ref>. SCATS (The Sydney Co-ordinated Adaptive Traffic System) optimizes cycle length, phase split, and offset so as to maintain the highest degree of saturation in the traffic network. Automatic coordination procedures are usually unique to each system.

Reference-contexts: For simplicity, we use ff = 1; fi = 2 or ff = 1; fi = 3 in many of our tests. Commercially available simulation programs were initially considered.

Reference-contexts: This is a sort of feed-forward control and it requires detectors upstream of the stop line (See Fig. 3). Coordination efforts may or may not be involved. Another proposed scheme similar to ALLONS-D is COP (Controlled Optimization of Phases) <ref> [Sen and Head, 1997] </ref>. It is a decentralized adaptive control scheme for an intersection that assumes that detectors will predict vehicle arrivals sufficiently so that a forward dynamic program can determine an optimal signal plan. <p> COMPARISON WITH DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING APPROACHES Other traffic control schemes like PRODYN [Henry et al., 1983] and COP <ref> [Sen and Head, 1997] </ref> rely on a forward dynamic programming approach to find a policy that minimizes an approximation of vehicle delay. Thus we are motivated to provide a comparison of the ALLONS-D optimal search procedure to a standard forward dynamic programming approach.

Reference-contexts: It is also a pleasure to acknowledge the important contributions of other researchers in the development of ALLONS-D scheme, most notably Meera Sampath and Raja Sengupta. The initial proposal of utilizing a decision tree for optimization purposes and the rolling horizon concept was reported in <ref> [Chen et al., 1995, Sengupta et al., 1995] </ref>. These initial concepts were extensively studied on a single intersection using a specially designed simulator called SITA (Single Intersection Test of ALLONS-D).

Reference-contexts: evidence of the example and Table 1, there would be a need to efficiently check for previously encountered states i.e., enable comparisons of newly expanded nodes to members of T . (States encountered could be stored in a hash table in order to check for repeated encounters in constant time <ref> [Wellman, 1998] </ref>.) Additional memory for the set T would need to be allocated. With the ALLONS algorithm, the expansion of nodes in the decisions tree requires no such considerations and incur no such burdens with ALLONS-D.

Reference-contexts: Automatic coordination procedures are usually unique to each system. Both adaptive cyclic schemes SCATS and SCOOT have coordination schemes that involve setting common cycle lengths and determining offsets. Adaptive-Noncyclic Systems like UTOPIA (SPOT) [Mauro and DiTaranto, 1990], OPAC [Gartner, 1990], PRODYN [Henry et al., 1983], and SPPORT <ref> [Yagar and Han, 1994] </ref> attempt to optimize traffic on-line without being confined to a cyclic signal plan | although a cyclic plan is not a prohibited result.

Reference-contexts: Goals of such systems include allowing a bus that is perhaps behind schedule to save time, reducing overall delay along transit routes, and thus improving consistency on routes. For an overview of some existing systems, the reader is referred to [Nelson et al., 1993] and <ref> [Yagar, 1993] </ref>. Bus Priority Systems can be categorized into two types: active priority and passive priority. Active priority systems allow a bus driver (or other transit operator) to command a nearby traffic light directly. <p> We examine the corresponding system performance as the relative priority of busses is increased in such a manner that active priority is approximated. The effect of loading and unloading of passengers (see <ref> [Yagar, 1993] </ref>) is not considered. A small portion of the Ann Arbor traffic network is used for this purpose; it is shown in Fig. 15.
