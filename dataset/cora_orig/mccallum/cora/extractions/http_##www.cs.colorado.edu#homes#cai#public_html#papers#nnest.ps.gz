Abstract: In this paper, we develop a new technique, and a corresponding theory, for Schwarz type overlapping domain decomposition methods for solving large sparse linear systems which arise from finite element discretization of elliptic partial differential equations. The theory provides an optimal convergence of an additive Schwarz algorithm that is constructed with a non-nested coarse space, and a not necessarily shape regular subdomain partitioning. The theory is also applicable to the graph partitioning algorithms recently developed, [5, 15], for problems defined on unstructured meshes.

Reference-contexts: The first quantity is independent of H. This allows us to use subdomains of arbitrary shape. As a consequence, our theory applies to the type of unstructured mesh problems decomposed by some graph-based partitioning techniques discussed by Cai and Saad in <ref> [5] </ref>. The second quantity reduces to that of Dryja and Widlund when H H c , and comes into play in the case of small overlap. <p> In practice, a graph based partitioning technique, such as those introduced in <ref> [5, 15] </ref>, can often be used to obtain i , especially if h is an unstructured grid.

This class of methods offers a great deal of parallelism and is very promising for modern parallel computers. <p> When solving a system of equations arising from the discretization of non-selfadjoint, or indefinite, or nonlinear elliptic problems by a Schwarz type algorithm, a fine enough coarse mesh space is usually used in order to make the convergence rate optimal, see e.g., <ref> [6, 7] </ref>. In such a case, using the Dryja-Widlund construction [13] would normally result in a large number of subdomains that have to be combined in order for the number of subproblems to fit the number of processors of a parallel computer.

This class of methods offers a great deal of parallelism and is very promising for modern parallel computers. <p> It has a convergence rate that is similar to that of the regular Dryja-Widlund type decomposition <ref> [13] </ref>, and does not require the coarse space to be a subspace of the original finite element space, in which the partial differential equation is discretized. Nor does it require that the collection of the un-extended subdomains forms a regular finite element subdivision. <p> In such a case, using the Dryja-Widlund construction <ref> [13] </ref> would normally result in a large number of subdomains that have to be combined in order for the number of subproblems to fit the number of processors of a parallel computer. With our new construction, the size of the coarse mesh is totally independent of the number of subdomains. <p> Let g = h g 0 + P N and g i = P i u fl h . Following the Schwarz theory of Dryja and Widlund <ref> [13] </ref>, it can be shown that, if the operator P is nonsingular, then the linear operator equation P u fl has the same solution as that of (1). We show in the next theorem that P is not only nonsingular but also uniformly bounded from both above and below. <p> We show in the next theorem that P is not only nonsingular but also uniformly bounded from both above and below.
