Abstract: A general methodology for effectively and accurately modeling air pollution phenomena in a natural way is proposed. A collaborative agent-based framework is presented and discuss. The development of a large advanced Long Range Transport of Air Pollution (LRTAP) model consisting of collaborating sub-models along this framework is demonstrated and its effectiveness is analyzed. The proposed scheme is easy to build, allows reuse of existing models and exhibits a high degree of inherent parallelism.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately there is a lot of inherent parallelism in the model which has been exploited in both early ([9], [7]) and recent ([4], <ref> [2] </ref>) studies. The advection and chemical sub-models are the most time consuming parts of the LRTAP problem. Loop based parallelism can be effectively used for the advection part. The chemical part is usually treated by either task based parallelism or 2 grid based domain decomposition. <p> Notice also that there is enough parallelism within each one of the sub-models so it can be exploited using conventional methods already in use. Load balancing this two level parallelization can be handled by either a dynamic scheme <ref> [2] </ref> or by an expert system. 4 A case study To demonstrate our domain splitting methodology we consider the area of the island of Crete depicted in Figure 2. Crete separates the Aegean from the Libyan Sea and marks the boundary between Europe and Africa.

Reference-contexts: The pattern of this coupling depends on modeling decisions but it is expected to be weak. We note that the CPU requirements for simulating an air quality episode for a period of several months using a typical global scale, third generation model <ref> [3] </ref> (1 ffi fi 1 ffi fi 20 grid resolution and up to S = 100 species) in a couple of days are in the range of teraFLOPS. <p> An additional feature of our framework is its capability of coupling the two different numerical approaches commonly used to solve the LRTAP model. Specifically a hybrid model combining both Lagrangian and Eulerian features did not seem to be either feasible nor useful so far <ref> [3] </ref>. Nevertheless the calculation of wind trajectories in the Lagrangian models can be used both to split the domain and to estimate concentrations along these trajectories and therefore serve as interface relaxation mechanisms. The new software required to build a collaborative LRTAP model is not substantial.

Reference-contexts: Step 2 Solve the sub-model in each subdomain and obtain a local solution. Step 3 Use the solution values to evaluate how well the interface conditions are satisfied. Use a relaxation formula ([5], <ref> [8] </ref>) to compute new values of the boundary conditions. Step 4 Iterate steps 2 and 3 until convergence. 3 Rather than provide further detailed descriptions of SciAgents and its un-derlying mathematical method, we outline how it would be applied to the LRTAP model in the next section. <p> Most of the chemistry sub-models defined this way can be significantly simpler then the universal model but obviously need to be coupled together by imposing certain conditions on the interface boundaries. Although the various schemes that are already in use <ref> [8] </ref> and which are solely based on the continuity (or discontinuity) of the concentration function and its flux can play the role of the interfacing, we strongly believe that more complicated conditions that naturally reflect the particular atmospheric and meteorological characteristics will be powerful tools in expert hands.
