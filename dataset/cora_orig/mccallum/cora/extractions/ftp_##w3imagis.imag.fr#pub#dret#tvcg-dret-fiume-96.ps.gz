Title: Structured Penumbral Irradiance Computation  
Author: George Drettakis, Eugene Fiume 
Abstract: A definitive understanding of irradiance behavior in penumbral regions has been hard to come by, mainly due to the computational expense of determining the visible parts of an area light source. Consequently, sampling strategies have been mostly ad hoc, and evaluation of the resulting approximations has been difficult. In this paper, the structure of penumbral irra-diance is investigated empirically and numerically. This study has been made feasible by the use of the discontinuity mesh and the backprojection, an efficient data structure representing visibility in regions of partial occlusion. Regions of penumbrae in which irradiance varies non-monotonically are characterized empirically, and numerical tests are performed to determine the frequency of their occurrence. This study inspired the development of two algorithms for the construction of interpolating approximations to irradiance: one algorithm reduces the number of edges in the mesh defining the interpolant domain, and the other algorithm chooses among linear, quadratic, and mixed interpolants based on irradiance monotonicity. Results from numerical tests and images are presented that demonstrate good performance of the new algorithms for various realistic test configurations.

Reference-contexts: In this fashion a continuous representation is constructed for the irradiance around a singularity. A special case occurs when the light source touches a different object. In this case we simply displace the vertex slightly so that we can apply the analytical point-to-area form-factor (e.g., <ref> [1] </ref>) to determine L max . D. Error Bounds for the Triangular Interpolants The theoretical error bounds for the linear and quadratic triangular interpolants have been given in Eqs. (2) and (4). <p> The value t tot is the total time spent to create the mesh, triangulate and construct the interpolants, t m is the mesh construction time, t bp is the backprojection calculation time, t ss is the cost of structured sampling (as in [11] but using irradiance gradients <ref> [1] </ref>), t 0:01 r is the cost of the edge removal algorithm for an area tolerance of 0.01 (1%) and t 0:09 r is the removal time for area tolerance of 0.09 (9%).

Reference-contexts: On these domains, constant basis functions are used with a value of zero. For this step, the computation of the complete mesh is a necessity, since boundaries of the umbra are often (EEE-induced) curved edges, which were not computed by previous discontinuity meshing algorithms (e.g., [22], <ref> [19] </ref>) although they have been treated for a different application in [30]. To achieve the construction of mixed linear/quadratic 10 interpolants, it is first necessary to characterize the edges of the mesh and the edges interior to the faces with a required degree of interpolation.

Reference-contexts: For triangles in which all three edges are linearly interpolated, the method of plates is used to construct a linear basis function over the triangle. For this interpolant the formal error bound is given by <ref> [25] </ref>: max j f (p) s N (p) j 4M 2 h 2 (4) where f is the irradiance function and s N is the interpolant, and h and M 2 are as in Eqs. (2) and (3). <p> For triangles on which all edges are of degree 2, a six-point interpolant is used <ref> [25] </ref>. The error bound for this interpolant was given in Eq. (1). Fig. 15.

As a consequence of degree selection, there are triangles for which some edges are linear and some are quadratic (see Fig. 16 (a) which follows the model of <ref> [25] </ref>). A special linear/quadratic basis function was designed to guarantee value continuity across such interpolants.

Reference-contexts: The value at the vertex is defined as a limit of the function as it approaches the singular point, and therefore it is multi-valued. To represent this using interpolants, as suggested by Tampieri <ref> [29] </ref>, we use degenerate tensor product interpolants. Nonetheless, the multiple values of irradiance at this vertex must be approximated. To achieve this, the total angle tot of the triangles neighboring the vertex is first computed. 11 Fig. 17.
