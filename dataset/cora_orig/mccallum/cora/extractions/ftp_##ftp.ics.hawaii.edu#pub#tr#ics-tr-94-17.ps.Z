Abstract: The MC (Maintenance Consultant) system helps users to maintain large software systems by providing access to a set of graphical models representing different aspects of the target software system. Users can combine natural language requests with pointing and MC responds either graphically, textually (tables and natural language), or in combination. Users can also ask about how to use various maintenance tools or invoke the tools. These multi-media capabilities depend on a number of user models that track static user information such as the user's job type, programming expertise, and security access level; the user's knowledge of different tools and products based on observing the amount and frequency of usage; the user's current task based on a process model for software maintenance; and the shared conversational and visual context.

Reference-contexts: One list represents the linguistic context (LC) and the other list represents the visual context (VC). Both lists consist of entries representing semantic objects (not only physical objects, but also actions, events, etc.) or collections of objects. The LC list is built up using standard linguistic techniques <ref> (c.f. Allen 1987 for an introduction) </ref>. The VC list consists of all visible objects within the meraTalk window. Both history lists are ordered by salience.

Reference-contexts: MC also handles static descriptions, but does not handle trajectories. Also, MC does not worry about points of view since the point of view is always that of the user. However, MC has a more sophisticated context tracking mechanism. The Integrated Interfaces project <ref> (Arens, Miller, & Sondheimer 1991) </ref>, the COMET system (Feiner & McK-eown 1990), the WIP system (Wahlster et al. 1993), the SAGE system (Roth, Mattis, & Mesnard 1991), and the CUBRICON system (Neil & Shapiro 1991) all combined natural language with graphical output.

Reference-contexts: Also, MC provides direct access to information stored in SMA's object base, whereas UC did not have access to UNIX. Both system's user models employ double-stereotypes (one range for the user, another range for difficulty of the information). UC's user modeling component, KNOME <ref> (Chin 1989) </ref>, estimated the user's level of expertise by making inferences based on the user's queries. MC directly observes the user's interaction with SMA and estimates the user's knowledge of specific tools and products based on amount and frequency of usage. Other systems have combined pointing with natural language input.

Reference-contexts: To make this process easier, SMA provides a set of fifteen graphical models that describe different aspects of the target software such as the data structures, functions, control flow, user interface, database schema, etc. These models are represented in the MERA language <ref> (Takeda, Chin, & Miyamoto 1992) </ref> and displayed/edited using the mer-aTalk graphical editor. Many of the models can be automatically derived directly from COBOL and JCL source code. Other models require user assistance to create. <p> How do I run it? In this example, the pronoun it refers to the KBVV model checker, which is the linguistic focus. The visual focus is established by the user highlighting the particular file icon. acquisition & maintenance Whenever MC's parser, PAU <ref> (Chin 1992) </ref>, understands a phrasal unit (noun-phrase, verb-phrase, prepositional-phrase or sentence), the phrase and its meaning is passed to the Context component. Indefinite noun-phrases, verb-phrases, prepositional-phrases, and sentences are added to the LC list. <p> An essential technological point that has greatly simplified implementation of MC and integration of MC with SMA is the shared usage of the MERA <ref> (Takeda, Chin, & Miyamoto 1992) </ref> language for representing both software models and MC knowledge throughout all SMA tools and products.

Reference-contexts: The LC list is built up using standard linguistic techniques (c.f. Allen 1987 for an introduction). The VC list consists of all visible objects within the meraTalk window. Both history lists are ordered by salience. In the LC list, salience is equivalent to linguistic focus <ref> (Grosz 1977) </ref>; in the VC list, the set of salient objects is the set of selected objects in the meraTalk editor. The contents of the VC list are always included within the LC list. This is because the user can always refer to any visible objects.

Reference-contexts: The higher the user's skill level, the more likely the user knows the tool/product. The user's skill level and security level is used by MC to understand certain indirect speech acts <ref> (Searle 1975) </ref>. Following the lead of (Allen 1979; Allen & Perrault 1980), the indirect speech act is analyzed based on the user's plans and goals.

Reference-contexts: Characteristics such as gender and number that usually associated with words are encoded in the meaning as attribute (similar to a slot in a frame) values. Comparison with Previous Research The most similar system to MC is the UC (UNIX Consultant) system <ref> (Wilensky et al. 1988) </ref>. Both MC and UC model the user's knowledge and provide help in using the underlying system (SMA for MC and UNIX for UC). However, MC has multi-media capabilities, combining text and graphics for output and text and pointing for input.
