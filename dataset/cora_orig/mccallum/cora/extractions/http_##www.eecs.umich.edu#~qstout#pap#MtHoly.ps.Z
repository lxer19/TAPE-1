Abstract: We show how to compute optimal designs and exact analyses of allocation rules for various sequential allocation problems. The problems we have solved include parameter estimation in an industrial scenario, and testing in a clinical trial. Our computational approach incorporates backward induction, dynamic programming, and a new technique of forward induction. By utilizing efficient algorithms and careful implementation, we are able to determine exact solutions to practical problems previously approached only through simulation or approximation.

Reference-contexts: For clinical trials, criteria of interest include * number of failures * number of expected successes lost <ref> [1] </ref> * number of patients assigned to the inferior treatment * sample size * cost * probability of correct selection, P (CS) * robustness. These criteria have multiple variants.

Reference-contexts: A third possibility, often encountered in the ranking and selection literature <ref> [2] </ref>, is to consider a minimax-like definition where there is an indifference region jp 2 p 1 j &lt; , and one is concerned with the smallest value of P (CSjp 1 ; p 2 ) outside this region.

Reference-contexts: The notion of a `state' becomes more complicated since it must now include an indication of the most recent treatment and the number of consecutive times it has been used. A different form of constraint was considered in <ref> [3, 10] </ref>, where a class of optimal equal allocation rules were considered. For a fixed sample size, one can show that the P (CS) is maximized by allocating equally to the two treatments.

Reference-contexts: For example, for quite some time it has been known that dynamic programming can be used to solve the finite 4 horizon uniform bandit problem, which is the problem of maximizing the expected number of successes <ref> [4] </ref>. In practice, however, dynamic programming and backward induction are often viewed as being too computationally slow or memory intensive, so they are often dismissed as being infeasible for interesting problems.

Reference-contexts: While the notion of using backward induction for arbitrary evaluation of allocation rules is not new, nor profound, it has rarely been used. Two of the few works with which we are familiar that apply this to sequential allocation are <ref> [5, 13] </ref>. 2.2 Wavefront Ordering Equations 1 and 2 show that C fl (s 1 ; f 1 ; s 2 ; f 2 ) can be evaluated once C fl (s 1 +1; f 1 ; s 2 ; f 2 ), C fl (s 1 ; f 1 +1; <p> Several researchers, including Berry <ref> [5, 6] </ref>, have noted that space can be reduced in the fixed horizon, nonstopping rule problem by utilizing the constraint that s 1 + f 1 + s 2 + f 2 n. This implies that only about 1/6 of the entries in the array are accessed. <p> This computational approach was used to help determine the parameters of the allocation rules presented in [7]. The advantages of this approach, and various implementation details of forward induction, are discussed in [11]. 11 5 Extensions and Conclusions This work, and that of others such as in <ref> [5, 13] </ref>, shows that exact computational design and analysis is possible for some practical sequential allocation problems. This ability allows one to create better, more flexible designs, optimized and analyzed for specific situations.

Reference-contexts: Our interests include both estimation and testing problems, and we have examined allocation rules for selected applications in medicine and industry. In the former, we study the design and evaluation of optimal allocation rules for clinical trials with ethical costs <ref> [7, 8, 10] </ref>. In the latter, we consider the problem of estimating the failure probability of a product composed of two subparts [9]. Generally speaking, our goal is to show that, rather than relying on asymptotic approximations or simulations as complete solutions to such problems, one can analyze them exactly. <p> Beyond this we know of no feasible procedure for producing other points along the curve, although certain ad hoc allocation rules, such as those described in <ref> [7] </ref>, give extremely good tradeoffs, nearly equal to fl EAF in probability of correct selection and nearly equal to fl F in expected failures. 9 4 Forward Induction Often it is useful to evaluate an allocation rule and criterion for multiple (p 1 ; p 2 ) pairs. <p> If the allocation rule is independent of the horizon, then calculations of P fl for small horizons can be continued for larger horizons, so one need not start over for each new horizon. This computational approach was used to help determine the parameters of the allocation rules presented in <ref> [7] </ref>. The advantages of this approach, and various implementation details of forward induction, are discussed in [11]. 11 5 Extensions and Conclusions This work, and that of others such as in [5, 13], shows that exact computational design and analysis is possible for some practical sequential allocation problems. <p> Since sequential designs often offer significant cost or ethical advantages over their nonadaptive counterparts, but are often perceived as being too complex and difficult to design, making them computationally tractable is an important step towards their more widespread adoption. This approach is also pursued in <ref> [7] </ref>, where the results were obtained using the computational techniques described in this paper. The work described here has concentrated on an important, but relatively simple, scenario in which response is dichotomous and immediate, and only two treatments are being evaluated.

Still, even a proof that there are fi (n 4 ) reachable states does not demonstrate that fi (n 4 ) time is needed to determine the minimum possible expected number of failures.

For example, in the fault tolerance problem studied in <ref> [9, 14, 16] </ref>, the goal was to minimize the mean squared error of the estimate of the fault tolerance. <p> Backward induction, however, has no such restriction, and thus can be used to evaluate rules on arbitrary criteria. For example, in <ref> [9] </ref>, dynamic programming was used to find optimal allocation rules for the product of means problem mentioned in the introduction. Given a prior distribution on the reliability parameters of the individual parts, dynamic programming was used to create an optimal rule fl .

Reference-contexts: This has apparently been noted by several researchers, and follows from a more general result in <ref> [12] </ref>. One can use dynamic programming to determine the optimum n-horizon equal allocation rule for criteria such as earliest expected curtailment (smallest expected sample size), fewest expected losses, least cost, etc.

Reference-contexts: In this case, each term on the right-hand side of equation 3 is multiplied by the probability that fl, being in the indicated state, would choose the relevant treatment. One example of such an allocation rule is randomized play the winner (RPW), introduced in <ref> [17] </ref>. 4.2 Time/Space Analysis Equation 3 shows that P fl obeys wavefront dependencies which are the reverse of the ones observed for backward induction.
