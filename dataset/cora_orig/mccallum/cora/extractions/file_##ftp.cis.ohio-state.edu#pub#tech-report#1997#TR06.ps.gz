Abstract: Real-time transport protocols rely on IP to disseminate audio/video packets from a sender to one or more receivers. In IP over ATM broadband networks, studies have shown that the effective bandwidth is reduced by at least 10% and that larger protocol payload sizes yield higher throughput. However, a dropped cell corrupts the IP packet it belongs to and reduces the rate successfully-received data, or goodput. This results in quality of service degradation to multimedia traffic, particularly for intra-frame encoded video raffic that is sensitive to a packet loss. A key observation for multimedia applications is that achieving maximum throughput versus reaching optimum goodput is determined by the end-to-end quality of service requirements. In this report, we derive analytic expressions for the maximum throughput and packet-loss probability which provides us with a better understanding of the goodput of real-time transport protocols. We also derive an analytic expression for optimum PDU that maximizes the goodput with respect to cell-loss probability and number of ATM switches. We show that optimum PDUs yield higher goodput than the default MTU for IP over ATM, particularly as the cell-loss probability and/or the number of ATM switches increase. For reliable multicast, We also derive analytic expressions to the expected total number of transmissions per packet and to the goodput of reliable multicast.

Reference-contexts: UDP header is 8 bytes and IP header is 20 bytes. The constructed IP datagram is referred to as ATM AAL5 payload. Although AAL5 can accept payloads up to 64K bytes, the maximum transmission unit, MTU, of IP over AAL5 is set to 9,180 bytes <ref> [Atk94] </ref>. AAL5 adds an 8-byte trailer that occupy the last 8 bytes of the last cell. If LLC/SNAP is used, 8 bytes are added as a header. 3 Optimum PDU for Maximum Unreliable Goodput In this section, we derive analytic expressions to maximum throughput, , and packet loss probability, p.

Reference-contexts: The ATM layer reduces the available bandwidth to the higher protocol layer by at least 10% due to ATM cell header overhead. Cavanaugh <ref> [Cav94] </ref> evaluated the available bandwidth to an application using Internet protocols and ATM over a variety of physical layers. Other studies evaluated the performance of Internet protocols over ATM [RF94, LO95, LFEN96]. The real-time transport protocol, RTP, provides end-to-end network transport services. It supports both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint transport.

Reference-contexts: Multimedia applications over the Internet disseminate audio/video traffic in real-time and are sensitive to network delays. However, they have various degrees of tolerance to packet loss. For example, the ITU recommendation H.261 <ref> [IT93] </ref> that uses the temporal redundancy of video to perform compression, is sensitive to packet loss. Thus, in specifying the RTP payload format for H.261 video, Turletti and Muitema [TH96] defined negative acknowledgement control packets to request packet retransmission. This approach mimics reliable transport protocols.

Reference-contexts: Hence, the goodput of reliable multicast protocols can be expressed as ff = 53 (c + 1)E [M ] Using Equation (1), we rewrite ff 0 ff = =E [M]: (9) The only unknown in Equation 8 is E [M ]. Using the result obtained in <ref> [PTK94] </ref>, we have: E [M ] = i=1 R ! (1 p i ) Thus, we can rewrite Equation (8) as ff = 53 (c + 1) i=1 R ! (1p i ) The expression for ff 0 is much more complex than that of ff in Equation (3).
