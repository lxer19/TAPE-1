Abstract: The one particle sector of the simplest one dimensional quantum lattice gas automaton has been observed to simulate both the (relativistic) Dirac and (nonrelativistic) Schrodinger equations, in different continuum limits. By analyzing the discrete analogues of plane waves in this sector we find conserved quantities corresponding to energy and momentum. We show that the Klein paradox obtains so that in some regimes the model must be considered to be relativistic and the negative energy modes interpreted as positive energy modes of antiparticles. With a formally similar approach|the Bethe ansatz |we find the evolution eigenfunctions in the two particle sector of the quantum lattice gas automaton and conclude by discussing consequences of these calculations and their extension to more particles, additional velocities, and higher dimensions.

Reference-contexts: Quantum computers are (as yet hypothetical) physical systems designed and programmed to take advantage of the quantum mechanical phenomena of superposition and interference in order to perform calculations more efficiently than is possible with a classical computer <ref> [1] </ref>. As the size of semiconductor devices decreases, useful quantum coherence first seems possible at the nanoscale [2] where the most plausible computer architecture is that of a cellular automaton [3]. Thus it is natural to consider quantum computation with lattice gas automata (LGA).

Reference-contexts: Thus it is natural to consider quantum computation with lattice gas automata (LGA). Just as classical LGA are more efficiently deployed to simulate physical processes like diffusion and fluid flow than for universal computation <ref> [4] </ref>, it seems likely that, as anticipated already by Feynman [5], the first useful quantum computation will be a QLGA simulation of some quantum mechanical process. Thus it is important to understand the physics of QLGA: their symmetries, their conserved quantities, and their macroscopic/continuum limits.

Reference-contexts: Although perhaps surprising at first, this is not inconsistent as the Dirac equation is well known to have a nonrelativistic limit [11] and, as Benzi and Succi have emphasized, numerical evolution of parabolic equations can be stabilized and localized by the use of artificially hyperbolic equations <ref> [6] </ref>. In Section 3 we use the physical interpretation of the conserved quantities in the model to distinguish relativistic and nonrelativistic regimes of the QLGA.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, Boghosian and Taylor have simulated the evolution of one particle plane waves in a two dimensional QLGA <ref> [7] </ref>. One would like to extend the Bethe ansatz to find multiparticle eigenfunctions in such a higher dimensional model, but should expect it to be even more difficult|there are very few higher dimensional lattice models known to be exactly solvable [13,23].

Reference-contexts: Meyer S may be parameterized by a = cos , b = i sin . The model is then equivalent to Feynman's path integral for a Dirac particle of mass <ref> [8] </ref>, but one might ask for the origin of the evolution rule (2.2) and (2.3)|from what does the particle scatter? One answer to this question will emerge at the end of the next section. H 1 . Each box represents one dimension of the Hilbert space. <p> Furthermore, they label a complete set of conserved quantities in terms of which the evolution can be exactly computed: Let X (k;*) (0)e ikx jxi denote the plane wave state vectors in H 1 . Then (dealing with normalization in the usual way <ref> [8] </ref>) the set fjk; *ig is an orthonormal basis for H 1 [16].

Reference-contexts: We showed in <ref> [10] </ref> that the most general unitary evolution for a one dimensional QLGA with parity invariance* and particle speed 1 is described in the one particle sector by a unitary scattering matrix S := b a * I.e., invariance under x ! x; also called reflection invariance. 3 QLGA and their invariants <p> We do so, completing the definition of the QLGA, in the next section. 4. The two particle sector In Section 2 we defined only the one particle sector of the model; in <ref> [10] </ref> we showed that the most general parity invariant local evolution rule which preserves particle number and has an exclusion principle is defined by the unitary scattering matrix R = B @ d a b 1 C where the central block is the scattering matrix S (2.3) and unitarity requires dd <p> The most general, no less local, QLGA in one dimension includes particles with `velocity' 0 <ref> [10] </ref>. We have determined the one particle plane waves for this model in [16] and it is natural to ask if the Bethe ansatz also solves this model exactly.

Reference-contexts: This model has been observed to simulate both the (nonrelativistic) Schrodinger equation [6,7] and the (relativistic) Dirac equation [8,9,10]. Although perhaps surprising at first, this is not inconsistent as the Dirac equation is well known to have a nonrelativistic limit <ref> [11] </ref> and, as Benzi and Succi have emphasized, numerical evolution of parabolic equations can be stabilized and localized by the use of artificially hyperbolic equations [6]. In Section 3 we use the physical interpretation of the conserved quantities in the model to distinguish relativistic and nonrelativistic regimes of the QLGA.

Reference-contexts: In Section 3 we use the physical interpretation of the conserved quantities in the model to distinguish relativistic and nonrelativistic regimes of the QLGA. Specifically, we show that the Klein paradox obtains <ref> [12] </ref>: a sufficiently discontinuous geometry/potential precludes interpretation of the QLGA as simulating a single nonrelativistic particle, compelling recognition of antiparticles in the model as well. In Section 4 we extend the one particle model to a multiparticle QLGA.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4 we extend the one particle model to a multiparticle QLGA. Introduction of all the two particle and antiparticle scattering amplitudes makes the QLGA formally (almost) equivalent to the six vertex model <ref> [13] </ref>. The exact solvability of the six vertex model leads us to expect a computable complete set of invariants for the multiparticle QLGA. Concentrating on the two particle sector of the model, we find these invariants explicitly and explain their physical meaning. <p> Figure 10 shows all the scattering rules implied by R; as in Figure 1 time runs upward so we indicate the presence of antiparticles by downward pointing arrows. This notation displays the (formal) equivalence of our one dimensional QLGA with two copies of the six vertex model <ref> [13] </ref>. The fact that two copies of the six vertex model are required stems from the usual Z 2 symmetry in one dimensional LGA: particles an even distance apart initially cannot interact on the integer lattice [18,19]. 10 QLGA and their invariants David A.

Reference-contexts: To make this precise we must first identify the Hilbert space of the theory. An orthonormal basis for the one particle sector H 1 of the Hilbert space H of the one dimensional QLGA is given by fjx; ffig (in the standard Dirac notation <ref> [14] </ref>), where x 2 L denotes position and ff 2 f1g denotes `velocity'.

Reference-contexts: In each case we proceed the same way, by making an appropriate ansatz for the form of a solution and then constraining the parameters in the ansatz by imposing additional (matching) conditions. As we explain in some detail in <ref> [16] </ref> for a QLGA which generalizes the one defined by (2.2) and (2.3), the appropriate ansatz for (2.6) is (k) ff (x ff) = e iffk (k) ff (x); (2:7) just as we would expect for a plane wave. <p> This wave has a higher frequency. 5 QLGA and their invariants David A. Meyer Just as in the continuum situation, therefore, ! and k bear interpretation as being proportional to energy and momentum, respectively <ref> [16] </ref>.
