Title: Approximate Propositional Deduction  
Author: Mukesh Dalal 
Keyword: REFERENCES  
Abstract: Since exact propositional deduction is CoNP-Hard, we are interested in tractable approximations that can be computed in PTIME. In this talk, we will survey several approaches for approximate deduction that are being currently investigated by the author. Some of these approximate methods guarantee either soundness or completeness of deduction. We will start by reviewing clausal boolean constraint propagation (BCP) [12], an incomplete but sound and linear-time method for deduction from clausal propositional theories. We will develop a model-theoretic semantics for BCP [8], and study fact propagation (FP) that extends BCP to non-clausal theories [2, 5]. FP will be specified using a confluent rewriting systems, for which we will present an algorithm that has quadratic-time complexity in general, but is still linear-time for clausal theories. FP performs strictly more inferences than CNF-BCP, a previously-proposed extension of BCP to non-clausal theories [11]. We will also present restricted fact propagation (RFP), a quadratic-time method that infers exactly the same literals as CNF-BCP, for which we also have a model-theoretic semantics. BCP, FP, and RFP are all incomplete reasoners. We will present a technique that extends them to families of increasingly-complete, sound, and tractable reasoners [4, 3, 6]. Our technique for generating these anytime families is based on restricting the length of the clauses used in chaining (Modus Ponens). We will also provide model-theoretic semantics for the reasoners in the anytime family based on BCP [7]. We will present results of some preliminary experiments in using these reasoners for determining consistency of temporal networks based on Allen's interval algebra [1, 10]. We will also present a compilation approach that approximates formulae of an expressive knowledge base by automatically mapping them to some restricted language [9]. We will discuss several mappings and their properties, and some anytime algorithms for computing these approximations. [1] J.F.
