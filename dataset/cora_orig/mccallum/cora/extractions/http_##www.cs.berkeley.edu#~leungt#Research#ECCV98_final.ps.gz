Abstract: Region-based image segmentation techniques make use of similarity in intensity, color and texture to determine the partitioning of an image. The powerful cue of contour continuity is not exploited at all. In this paper, we provide a way of incorporating curvilinear grouping into region-based image segmentation. Soft contour information is obtained through orientation energy. Weak contrast gaps and subjective contours are completed by contour propagation. The normalized cut approach proposed by Shi and Malik is used for the segmentation. Results on a large variety of images are shown.

Reference-contexts: Note that in this paper, we have only considered gray-level and color images. However, real images will also have texture. The normalized cuts framework can incorporate texture information very naturally. Techniques for doing texture segmentation in the normalized cuts framework are studied in <ref> [1, 26] </ref>. However, the effect of contour continuation in textured regions may have to be treated in a more subtle fashion, depending on the class of texture [3]. We are exploring this in ongoing work.

Reference-contexts: Most techniques employ some form of edge detection followed by a linking process.

In general, these methods can bridge small gaps along an edge to produce an extended contour. Another direction of work is the computation of subjective contours. Most methods involve first the computation of key-points, such as junctions, corners and line ends.

Our algorithm can be easily extended to take this into account. Together with orientation energy, we can compute end-stop energy.

Reference-contexts: Thus, any algorithm exploiting curvilinear continuity should be able to deal with subjective contours naturally. With the distance function defined, the normalized cut procedure proposed by Shi and Malik in <ref> [25] </ref> is employed to produce the segmentation. The outline of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, previous work in curvilinear grouping will be reviewed. How we exploit curvilinear continuity in defining pixel similarity is described in Section 3. The overall image segmentation algorithm is presented in Section 4. <p> One can think of the ff's as prior knowledge relating to the relative importance of the different factors. In this paper, we provide a way of adjusting these parameters for each image. This will be discussed in section 4.2. First, we will review the normalized cuts algorithm <ref> [25] </ref> which we used to segment the image based on the similarity measure in Equation 6. 4.1 Image Segmentation using Normalized Cuts Let W 2 R NfiN be the association matrix, i.e. W ij is the weight between pixels i and j (Equation 6). <p> For discussions on this criterion, please refer to <ref> [25] </ref>. One key advantage of using the normalized cut is that a good approximation to the optimal partition can be computed very efficiently. 2 Let W be the association matrix, i.e. W ij is the weight between nodes i and j in the graph. <p> If we relax y to take on real values (instead of two discrete values), we can optimize Equation 8 by solving a generalized eigenvalue system. Efficient algorithms with polynomial running time are well-known for solving such problems. For details of the derivation of Equation 8, please refer to <ref> [25] </ref>.
