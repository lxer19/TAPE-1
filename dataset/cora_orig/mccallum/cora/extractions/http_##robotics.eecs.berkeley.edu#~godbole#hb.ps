Abstract: This paper compares safety of automated and manual highway systems with respect to resulting rear-end collision frequency and severity. The results show that automated driving is safer than the most alert manual drivers, at similar speeds and capacities. We also present a detailed safety-capacity tradeoff study for four different Automated Highway System concepts that differ in their information structure and separation policy.

This gives us low and high braking capability values that are consistent with data estimated in [6]. Since all the analyses in the literature <ref> [3, 2, 1] </ref> make assumptions on vehicle braking capabilities, better data on brake wear and tear is extremely desirable. This data yields the histogram shown in Figure 2 1 . A truncated Gaussian distribution is fitted to this data as shown in the figure.

Reference-contexts: Such communication delivery times are used for automated vehicle experiments as described in <ref> [10] </ref>. t com;lo 50 ms This delay is the communication and computation time needed to discern that the lead vehicle is applying emergency braking, assuming that the lead vehicle communicates its onset of emergency braking over a channel without delivery time guarantees. <p> The lead vehicle does not communicate an emergency message during hard braking. Thus hard braking detection is by range and range-rate sensors. The value of 200 ms allows estimation of the acceleration of the lead vehicle using 10 sensor readings at the 20 ms loop time reported in <ref> [10] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An estimate of the distribution of driver reaction times for highway driving was obtained by fitting a lognormal distribution to reaction time data collected by Michael Sivak as detailed in <ref> [12] </ref>. The data was collected by measuring brake reaction times of unalerted drivers at highway speeds up to about 20 m=s. The lognormal distribution is fixed with median = 1:07 s, mean = 1:21 s, standard deviation = 0:63 s, and dispersion parameter = 0:49. <p> The two collision velocity distributions shown for manual driving reflect two possible assumptions about the driver reaction delay. The curve representing an `alert' driver was derived assuming a reaction time of 0.5 s, which is near the minimum delay reported in <ref> [12] </ref>. The other curve is derived using the full reaction delay distribution described above for unalerted highway drivers. Thus, these two distributions form a reasonable range for the safety of manual driving under the hard braking scenario.

Reference-contexts: We expect the same in AHS, with hard braking emergencies arising only in response to rare malfunctions. For automated driving, REC frequency and severity estimates are computed for different AHS speeds and capacities. For manual driving, the estimates are computed using data from <ref> [13] </ref>, collected on a limited access freeway operating at approximately 65 mph and servicing 1600 vphpl. These AHS and manual driving estimates are compared with each other. <p> This data was collected on a 55 mile sequence of highways in Ann Arbor and the Metropolitan Detroit area <ref> [13] </ref>. We used a probability distribution of the correlated range and range-rate from this data as shown in Figure 4. Note that this range and range rate data is collected using a separate experiment from the one that is used to get reaction times. <p> In order to estimate the collision velocity distribution under hard braking for manual driving, we assumed that the velocity of the follower vehicle was the mean of the velocity distribution in <ref> [13] </ref>. The mean of the velocity distribution is v mean = 29:3 m=s. 4 Results First, we compare the safety of automated and manual driving in the hard braking scenario. <p> The spacing of the autonomous vehicles is chosen to correspond to an AHS capacity of 2500 vphpl. The manual driving data from <ref> [13] </ref> was collected under non rush hour conditions along a route whose average volume was less than 1600 vphpl.

Reference-contexts: The amplification factor A represents the maximum increase in vehicle braking effort that occurs as vehicles brake successively in a platoon. In <ref> [15] </ref>, it is shown that in order to achieve string stability (attenuation of spacing errors in a string of vehicles) during constant space following, the following vehicles should apply higher actuation force than the platoon leader. We set A = 1:2 as determined in [15]. <p> In <ref> [15] </ref>, it is shown that in order to achieve string stability (attenuation of spacing errors in a string of vehicles) during constant space following, the following vehicles should apply higher actuation force than the platoon leader. We set A = 1:2 as determined in [15]. This value ensures that the follower platoon stops without any intra-platoon collisions. All collisions occur in the lead platoon of the hard braking scenario. This stringent inter-platoon spacing design criterion is imposed to make the probability of platoon-platoon collisions in the hard braking scenario negligible 2 . <p> With regard to the latter, we assume that the stable operation of au-tomated vehicle strings is an AHS design requirement. For the technological feasibility of designing vehicle following systems that attenuate longitudinal disturbances as they propagate through a vehicle string (i.e., string stability) refer to <ref> [15] </ref>. For these reasons, it is assumed that LVD's caused by string instabilities are negligible on the automated highway. Thus H of represents the set of LVD causing hazard occurrences on the automated highway.

This study considers intra-platoon spacings between 1 and 10 m. 3.2 Parameter Values for Manual Driving Model Just as an AHS was decomposed into a vehicle and an AHS system, a manual highway system can be decomposed into a vehicle and the driver behavior.

Reference-contexts: The commands are shifted in time by the communication or sensing delay. The response of the brake actuator is a dead time in series with a first order lag response <ref> [17] </ref>. The lead and follower vehicle responses are shown as "Front car response (actual)" and "Back car response (actual)." Some typical dead times and lags are described in table 1. <p> Although current production vehicles can not achieve this value, it is consistent with brake actuator tests, on prototype automated vehicles as reported in <ref> [17] </ref>. t com;hi 20 ms This delay is the communication and computation time needed to discern that the vehicle ahead is applying emergency braking, assuming that the lead vehicle communicates its onset of emergency braking on a guaranteed delivery time channel, i.e., there is high cooperation between individual vehicles.

Reference-contexts: We restrict attention to REC's caused by LVD. This is a significant class of crashes. For example, 18 % of all 1994 crashes belong to this category <ref> [23] </ref>. The probability of a REC in a LVD situation is related to the magnitude of the lead vehicle deceleration. The higher the deceleration and the longer it lasts the greater the probability of a REC. <p> Such an estimate may be quantified in financial terms by multiplying it by the cost per crash. For example, we know from <ref> [23] </ref> that there were 1.66 million rear-end crashes in the year 1994 that cost a total of 35.4 billion dollars. We also know from [29] that these 1.66 million rear-end crashes corresponds to 2; 347; 295; 000; 000 vehicle miles travelled. <p> This argument is similar to that used in <ref> [22, 23] </ref> for estimating the crash mitigation properties of adaptive cruise control and longitudinal crash warning systems.

Reference-contexts: We show how the safety and capacity of an AHS are inversely related, i.e., increases in capacity are accompanied by decreases in safety. Four AHS concepts <ref> [28] </ref> are analyzed, namely Autonomous Individual Vehicles, Low Cooperative Individual Vehicles, High Cooperative Individual Vehicles, and Cooperative Platooned Vehicles. The high and low cooperative concepts are assumed to transmit emergency warnings from leader to follower vehicles in the hard braking emergency. Thus they presuppose some kind of communication capability.

Reference-contexts: The safety impacts of secondary crashes in a string of vehicles is not analyzed. The safety analyses are conducted in the hard braking scenario. We believe that most LVD disturbances on current highways are not so severe. More data on such disturbances is gradually becoming available <ref> [30] </ref>. We hope this will lead to more accurate safety estimates in the future. There is also scope for improvement in the capacity estimation. Pipeline capacity is clearly an upper bound on the AHS lane flow.
