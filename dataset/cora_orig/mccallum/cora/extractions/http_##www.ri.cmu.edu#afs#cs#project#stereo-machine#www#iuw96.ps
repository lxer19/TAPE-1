Title: Abstract  
Abstract: The CMU RSTA Project has been developing a video-rate stereo machine that has the capability of generating a dense depth map at the video rate. The performance bench marks of the CMU video-rate stereo machine are: 1) multi image input of up to 6 cameras; 2) throughput of 30 million point disparity range per second; 3) frame rate of 30 frame/ sec; 4) a dense depth map of up to 256 240 pixels; 5) disparity search range of up to 60 pixels; 6) high precision of depth output up to 8 bits (with interpolation). The capability of passively producing such a dense depth map (3D representation) of a scene at the video rate can open up a new class of applications of 3D vision: merging real and virtual worlds in real time.

Reference-contexts: Currently disparity measurement with interpolation operates at 15 frames per second with the frame size of 200200 image size. 3.4. Camera Head A new stereo head with 5 CCD cameras has been built (see Figure 1 (b)). Unlikely the other older camera head (reported in the 94 PI report <ref> [Kanade, 1994] </ref>) where six cameras are arranged in an inverse L shape, the new head uses five cameras in an X shape configuration. The camera at the middle of the camera head is the base camera f 0 , with which the other cameras make four stereo pairs.

Reference-contexts: New Applications of the Stereo Machine Besides robotic applications, such as autonomous vehicles, the capability of producing a dense 3D representation at video rate opens up a new class of applications for 3D vision. We report two such new applications: virtualized reality <ref> [Kanade et al., 1995a] </ref> and z keying [Kanade et al., 1995c]. 4.1. Z Keying In visual media communication and display, it is often necessary to merge a video signal from a real camera and a synthetic video signal from computer graphics.

Reference-contexts: Figure 12 shows an example of a synthesized image sequence of a virtualized baseball scene. A scene of a person swinging a bat is captured, and the balls eye view is hit by the bat, and soars high and away into the sky <ref> [Kanade et al., 1995b] </ref>. Due to the limitations in image input and computation, this example was created off-line.

Chroma keying is a standard technique for such a purpose, as used in TV weather reports.
