Title: An Adaptive Approach to Query Mediation across Heterogeneous Information Sources

Abstract: We propose a query mediation framework to support customizable information gathering across heterogeneous and autonomous information sources. Instead of an integrated (and static) global schema, we propose an adaptive approach to interoperability which allows information consumers to represent their queries based on the customized personal view rather than a system-defined integrated view. The query mediation framework consists of five steps: query routing, query decomposition, parallel access plan generation, subquery translation and execution, and query result assembly. Concrete examples illustrate the challenges arising from heterogeneity in these five steps and how the framework scales up as the number of information sources grow and evolve.

Although the enforcement of a single global schema through data integration yields full transparency for uniform access, component databases have much restricted autonomy, scalability and their evolution becomes difficult.

Reference-contexts: The relations or classes are described as boxes and the links indicate the primary key and foreign key relationships or object reference relationships. The arrow links are depicted as superclass and subclass relationships. Fragments of the export schemas of these information sources are given in <ref> [13] </ref>. Obviously, some of these information sources have similar data contents, but their representations are different. This is generally true for most of the information sources that are created and managed by separate organizations (information producers) with different business objectives or using different types of data repository managers. <p> Since this paper's focus is on query processing in a large heterogeneous environment, we only outline the relevant metadata management services here. Details may refer to our technical report <ref> [13] </ref>. For this paper, we assume that the distributed metadata management system in DIOM is capable of representing and maintaining a mediator's knowledge. <p> The basic construct in DIOM-IQL is a SQL-like SELECT-FROM-WHERE expression. The syntax is: [TARGET &lt;Source-expressions&gt;] SELECT &lt;Fetch-expressions&gt; FROM &lt;Fetch-target-list&gt; [WHERE &lt;Fetch-conditions&gt;] [GROUP BY &lt;Fetch-expression&gt;] [ORDER BY &lt;Fetch-expression&gt; ] The detailed syntax description of an IQL expression is provided in <ref> [13] </ref>. The IQL design follows a number of assumptions: First, IQL by itself is not computationally complete. However, queries can invoke methods. Second, IQL is truly declarative. It does not require the users to specify the navigational access paths or the join conditions. <p> We summarize these catalog mapping operators in Figure 4. These mapping functions utilize the metadata information main-tained in the information source catalog and the interface repository (for an example see <ref> [13] </ref>). In the design of the query routing Algorithm, the application of operators A-map, G-map, or S-map is recursive. The recursion ends when all the compound interface types defined in terms of interface generalization/specialization and interface aggregation are replaced by the corresponding base interface types. <p> Then the operator D-map is used to find the correspond information source name. Due to the space limitation, the algorithm for selecting candidate information sources is omitted here. We will illustrate the flavor of our algorithm by examples. Readers may refer to <ref> [13] </ref> for detail. Consider the query Q 1 given in Figure 3. The interface types involved in the query Q are Book and Supplier. The query routing algorithm discover the relevant sources by applying the catalog mapping operators to these interfaces. <p> It is only used as an internal representation. Users will have no knowledge of it. Also, the algorithm for candidate information source filtering is omitted here due to the space limitation. Readers may refer to <ref> [13] </ref> for detail. An information consumer may also specify the target information sources of interest explicitly in an IQL query using the TARGET clause. <p> This is done in three steps: (1)Attribute conversion and type replacement. (2)Completion of the subquery expression. (3)Sub-query refinement. Due to the space limitation, an example is used to illustrate these steps. For detail see <ref> [13] </ref>. Consider the book sale scenario. Recall Section 4.3, the query Q 1 was decomposed into two subqueries SubQ1 and SubQ2. The procedure of subquery translation proceeds as follows: * (1) Attribute conversion and type replacement The procedure of subquery translation starts with attribute conversion and type replacement . <p> For instance, by using the metadata maintained in the implementation repository of DR2 <ref> [13] </ref>, we may find that the mediated attribute Book-&gt;price has the matching source attribute Order.price in the source DR2. Following a similar approach, all the mediated attributes are replaced by the corresponding source attributes.

We have proposed the Distributed Interoperable Object Model (DIOM) [14] in the context of the Diorama project as a concrete information mediation architecture to support the cooperation in a network of specialized mediators.

The distinctive features of the DIOM architecture include: the support for USECA properties in the development of distributed object query services [14], and the flexible cooperation of a network of mediators for transparent query processing. In contrast, much of previous work (summarized in Section 2) addresses only one or a subset of the USECA properties, and the combination of all USECA properties remains a challenge. <p> going into details of the query mediation steps, we first briefly describe the metadata model and the features of DIOM IDL and IQL. 3.3 The DIOM Metadata Model The DIOM metadata model is developed in the Diorama project for construction of a USECA view of data from disparate information sources <ref> [14] </ref>. It consists of an interface description language (IDL) and an interface query language (IQL). Rather than inventing yet another object-oriented data model, DIOM adopts the ODMG-IDL and ODMG-OQL object database standard [5, 10] as the base model with two major extensions: 1. <p> We use the term "mediated metadata" to distinguish the description of the metadata, defined by information consumers, at mul-tidatabase level from the metadata defined at information source level. A detailed discussion on DIOM interface description language (IDL) may refer to <ref> [14] </ref>. In the DIOM query mediation framework, an information consumer may build his/her special-purpose information mediator using either DIOM-IDL or DIOM-IQL and the associated query services.

However, the integration of component schemas at each multidatabase level is enforced by the system. The integrated schema is static. <p> The consumer's interface schema defined in DIOM-IDL is different from the conventional global schema approach to multidatabase integration in at least three ways: 1. Unlike in the tightly-coupling approach to schema integration <ref> [21] </ref> where equivalent attributes are merged into one attribute, the DIOM mediated attributes are only given in a logical form. That is, a mediated attribute is solely a semantic correspondence to, rather than an absolute integration/generalization of, the equivalent attributes in component information sources.
