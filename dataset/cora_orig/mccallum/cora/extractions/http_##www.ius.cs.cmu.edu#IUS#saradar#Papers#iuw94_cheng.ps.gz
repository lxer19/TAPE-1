Abstract: This paper presents two different algorithms for reconstructing 3D points from two sets of noisy 2D image points without knowing point correspondences given the corresponding poses from the two images. We first present a new way to form a 2D similarity function between two points from two images via 3D pseudo-intersection. Based on principles of proximity and exclusion, the first algorithm uses a new affinity measure between 2D image points from two different images and a competition scheme to establish image point correspondences and recover their corresponding 3D points simultaneously. Based on an optimal graph theoretic approach, the second algorithm uses the similarity function to construct a bipartite graph, builds a corresponding flow network, and finally finds a maximum network flow that determines the correspondences between two images. The two proposed algorithms have been applied to aerial images from the ARPA RADIUS project. Experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithms are robust.

Reference-contexts: Objects in the world can be nonrigid, and an object's appearance can deform as the viewing geometry changes. Consequently, much work has also been done that addresses the problem of correspondence and description by using deformable models [10-11,17-19]. Scott and Longuet-Higgins <ref> [10] </ref> developed an algorithm to determine the possible correspondences of 2D point features across a pair of images without any other information (in particular, they had no information about the poses of the cameras). <p> Then we present two different algorithms for reconstructing 3D points from noisy 2D image points without knowing the point correspondences. The first algorithm uses a new version of an affinity measure to extend the work in <ref> [10] </ref> via the principles of proximity and exclusion. Our second algorithm is based on an optimal graph theoretic approach using the similarity function to construct a bipartite graph, build a corresponding flow network, and finally find a maximum network flow that determines the correspondences between two images. <p> The next two sections present two algorithms for determining point correspondences using the similarity function sf (p l i ; p r 3 Algorithm based on principles of proximity and exclusion Following the basic idea in Scott and Longuet-Higgins' work <ref> [10] </ref>, we uses pose information to achieve a new powerful version of proximity matrix.

Then they used the eigenvectors of this matrix to determine correspondences between two sets of feature points. Shapiro and Brady <ref> [11] </ref> also proposed an eigenvector approach to determining point-feature correspondence based on a modal shape description. Recently, Sclaroff and Pentland [19] described a modal framework for correspondence and description. <p> For the first algorithm to work well, a sufficiently large must be chosen, yet it must not be too large since thsi would drive the smaller singular values towards zero. If this occurs, the association matrix becomes unstable. This conforms the conclusion reached in <ref> [11] </ref>. The second algorithm utilizes a threshold T d on the error function to build the initial bipartite graph. This threshold must be chosen empiri cally.

Reference-contexts: Then they used the eigenvectors of this matrix to determine correspondences between two sets of feature points. Shapiro and Brady [11] also proposed an eigenvector approach to determining point-feature correspondence based on a modal shape description. Recently, Sclaroff and Pentland <ref> [19] </ref> described a modal framework for correspondence and description. In this paper, we first investigate the problem of determining image point correspondences given the poses of two images while simultaneously computing the corresponding 3D points.

Reference-contexts: Our experiments have shown that the two algorithms can tolerate a difference in the number of image points from two images and are robust against a reasonable level of noise. The experimental results <ref> [20] </ref> also show that it is very difficult to choose an appropriate value for the parameter in the first algorithm and a that is too large can not be chosen.

Reference-contexts: The following theorem <ref> [21] </ref> shows that a matching in G corresponds directly to a flow in the corre sponding flow network G 0 . <p> If so, the correspondence problem is equivalent to finding the maximum flow in G 0 = (V 0 ; E 0 ), and we can compute a maximum matching in G by finding a maximum flow in G 0 . It has been shown <ref> [21] </ref> that if we use the Ford-Fulkerson method, the maximum flow f computed by it can ensure that j f j is integer-valued, and the cardinality of a maximum matching in a bipartite graph G is the value of a maximum flow in its corresponding flow network G 0 . <p> The final step is to use the Ford-Fulkerson method to efficiently obtain a maximum matching M from the integer-valued maximum flow. A complete description of their algorithm can be found in <ref> [21] </ref> and will not be given here.
