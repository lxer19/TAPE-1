Reference-contexts: Since all datagrams destined to a roaming mobile ES must be routed via the home area 32 for both TUBA and CDPD, neither method appears to be ideal for supporting ES mobility. In conjunction with MITRE Corporation, the Federal Aviation Administration is creating the Aeronautical Telecommunication Network (ATN) <ref> [3] </ref>, in order to upgrade air-to-ground communications capabilities. The ATN project deals with flying ISs, rather than flying ESs. Each IS (one per plane) is tracked as a separate ISO OSI routing domain. <p> 4 4 2 0 6 6 6 6 - - 3 4 2 5 5 1 3 6 6 6 6 2 0 4 4 - - 3 4 2 5 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 0 - -; (* connect up the ISs *) <ref> [ 1 | 2, 3 ] </ref> := MsgItoI; [ 2 | 1, 4, 5 ] := MsgItoI; [ 3 | 1, 6, 7 ] := MsgItoI; [ 4 | 2, 8, 9 ] := MsgItoI; [ 5 | 2, 10, 11 ] := MsgItoI; [ 6 | 3, 12, 13 ]

Reference-contexts: The body of relevant literature is also growing. A recent paper by Molva, Samfat, and Tsudik [40] looks at authentication in environments with mobile users, and another paper by Aziz and Diffie <ref> [4] </ref> describes a protocol to provide privacy and authentication for wireless LANs. 140 8.2.3 Mobile Subnetworks The mobility design that we have presented tracks individual mobile ESs as they move around an internetwork.

Reference-contexts: All datagram-based internetworks have security and authentication problems. ES mobility introduces surprisingly few new problems. We distinguish between the presumed and actual threats, and discuss possible approaches to the latter category. Bellovin <ref> [5] </ref> provides an overview of the many security problems on the TCP/IP Internet. One of the more obvious-seeming problems with mobility over wireless links is vulnerability to eavesdropping. In fact, some wired Local Area Network (LAN) technologies are equally or more vulnerable to eavesdropping. <p> - - 3 4 2 5 5 1 3 6 6 6 6 2 0 4 4 - - 3 4 2 5 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 0 - -; (* connect up the ISs *) [ 1 | 2, 3 ] := MsgItoI; <ref> [ 2 | 1, 4, 5 ] </ref> := MsgItoI; [ 3 | 1, 6, 7 ] := MsgItoI; [ 4 | 2, 8, 9 ] := MsgItoI; [ 5 | 2, 10, 11 ] := MsgItoI; [ 6 | 3, 12, 13 ] := MsgItoI; [ 7 | 3, 14, 15

Reference-contexts: One could imagine making a similar translation for a personal telephone number, yielding the telephone number of the individual's current physical location. In fact, Bellcore has developed a high-performance database architecture, called Datacycle <ref> [6] </ref>, that would be capable of providing real-time name service for a network of 280 million users. Such a database might, for example, make it possible to assign a personal telephone number to each telephone subscriber in the United States. <p> 6 6 6 6 2 0 4 4 - - 3 4 2 5 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 0 - -; (* connect up the ISs *) [ 1 | 2, 3 ] := MsgItoI; [ 2 | 1, 4, 5 ] := MsgItoI; <ref> [ 3 | 1, 6, 7 ] </ref> := MsgItoI; [ 4 | 2, 8, 9 ] := MsgItoI; [ 5 | 2, 10, 11 ] := MsgItoI; [ 6 | 3, 12, 13 ] := MsgItoI; [ 7 | 3, 14, 15 ] := MsgItoI; [ 8 | 4 ] :=

Reference-contexts: C-shell scripts were written to automate the production of a set of simulation control files, by feeding appropriate inputs to the mobility scenario generator and to the topology and routing generator. The scripts are also able to produce a Condor <ref> [7] </ref> control file, so that the set of simulation jobs can be submitted to the Condor batch job control system. 6.5 Graphing The volume of statistical data generated can be overwhelming, especially when comparing a number of simulation runs. <p> 6 6 6 6 2 0 4 4 - - 3 4 2 5 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 0 - -; (* connect up the ISs *) [ 1 | 2, 3 ] := MsgItoI; [ 2 | 1, 4, 5 ] := MsgItoI; <ref> [ 3 | 1, 6, 7 ] </ref> := MsgItoI; [ 4 | 2, 8, 9 ] := MsgItoI; [ 5 | 2, 10, 11 ] := MsgItoI; [ 6 | 3, 12, 13 ] := MsgItoI; [ 7 | 3, 14, 15 ] := MsgItoI; [ 8 | 4 ] :=

Reference-contexts: Finally, certain of the L2 ISs are also Border Intermediate Systems (BISs); BISs exchange information about 28 the reachability of other domains. In Carlberg's <ref> [8] </ref> proposal, each mobile ES is assigned a logical address; such an address is apparently distinct from any physical address, and is retained as the mobile ES relocates. <p> - 3 4 2 5 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 0 - -; (* connect up the ISs *) [ 1 | 2, 3 ] := MsgItoI; [ 2 | 1, 4, 5 ] := MsgItoI; [ 3 | 1, 6, 7 ] := MsgItoI; <ref> [ 4 | 2, 8, 9 ] </ref> := MsgItoI; [ 5 | 2, 10, 11 ] := MsgItoI; [ 6 | 3, 12, 13 ] := MsgItoI; [ 7 | 3, 14, 15 ] := MsgItoI; [ 8 | 4 ] := MsgItoI; [ 9 | 4 ] := MsgItoI; [

Reference-contexts: Communication patterns among ESs result from virtual communities of interest, and members of those communities may be geographically separated. Thus, ESs communicating with a mobile ES may be quite far away. We assume that ESs relocate frequently enough that a global dynamic database such as the X.500 Directory Service <ref> [9] </ref> is unsuitable for tracking an ES's current location. However, given a reasonable locality of movement, such a database can be used to point to an ES's "neighborhood." Fine location tracking should be done at the network layer. <p> The locality of movement of mobile ESs is exploited by using a two part strategy for tracking the location of a mobile ES. The home address of a mobile ES, which changes slowly, is stored in a global database such as the X.500 Directory Service <ref> [9] </ref>, while the current address is cached at the home location. A mobile ES is responsible for sending a Reconnect message to its home IS after the ES relocates. <p> One possibility would be to store this information in a global dynamic database such as the X.500 Directory Service <ref> [9] </ref>, and to update the ES!NSAP address binding each time that a mobile ES relocates to another area. <p> - 3 4 2 5 5 3 1 6 6 6 6 4 4 2 0 - -; (* connect up the ISs *) [ 1 | 2, 3 ] := MsgItoI; [ 2 | 1, 4, 5 ] := MsgItoI; [ 3 | 1, 6, 7 ] := MsgItoI; <ref> [ 4 | 2, 8, 9 ] </ref> := MsgItoI; [ 5 | 2, 10, 11 ] := MsgItoI; [ 6 | 3, 12, 13 ] := MsgItoI; [ 7 | 3, 14, 15 ] := MsgItoI; [ 8 | 4 ] := MsgItoI; [ 9 | 4 ] := MsgItoI; [

Reference-contexts: The design is nearly identical to that proposed by the IETF Mobile IP working group; in fact, the draft specification [50] acknowledges that it was copied almost verbatim from the IETF's text. The Cellular Digital Packet Data CDPD <ref> [10] </ref> network uses idle transmission capacity in the North American analog cellular telephony network to transmit IP and CLNP datagrams. CDPD follows the ISO OSI connectionless routing architecture, and support for mobility is similar to that proposed for TUBA. <p> ES moves.

Reference-contexts: In fact, developers are specifically discouraged <ref> [11] </ref> from making engineering decisions that rely on the ID being globally unique; from the perspective of providing mobility, having a nonunique ID is certainly a bad idea!

Reference-contexts: For the duration of the call, traffic is routed via the home area. To handle a subscriber who roams to one or more new areas during a conversation, it appears that the cellular providers plan to "cheat." Instead of making use of the long distance networks, preliminary information <ref> [12] </ref> indicates that providers are going to install direct links between cooperating mobile systems. In fact, the EIA Interim Standards on Intersystem Handoff [17] and Automatic Roaming [18] assume the presence of direct links. <p> (* connect up the ISs *) [ 1 | 2, 3 ] := MsgItoI; [ 2 | 1, 4, 5 ] := MsgItoI; [ 3 | 1, 6, 7 ] := MsgItoI; [ 4 | 2, 8, 9 ] := MsgItoI; [ 5 | 2, 10, 11 ] := MsgItoI; <ref> [ 6 | 3, 12, 13 ] </ref> := MsgItoI; [ 7 | 3, 14, 15 ] := MsgItoI; [ 8 | 4 ] := MsgItoI; [ 9 | 4 ] := MsgItoI; [ 10 | 5 ] := MsgItoI; [ 11 | 5 ] := MsgItoI; [ 12 | 6 ]

Reference-contexts: While this approach may be suitable for the specific case of flying ISs, and makes efficient use of the limited bandwidth air-to-ground interface, the approach is not practical for the general case of ES mobility. 2.3 Flat Address 2.3.1 Xerox Network System As described by Dalal and Printis <ref> [13] </ref>, the Xerox Network System uses a 48-bit flat internet address to identify an ES; however, along with an internet address, the clearinghouse (a directory agent) returns a network number for use as a "very strong routing hint." The 48-bit internet address is a globally unique ID, and is also used <p> Fowler [22] extended the DEMOS/MP format to include a timestamp. In both DEMOS/MP and Fowler's work, message delivery is guaranteed as long as the process or object still exists; if necessary, a message will be forwarded one or more times. The Xerox Network System <ref> [13] </ref> uses a 48-bit flat internet address, along with a network number that is used as a routing hint; the network number, however, is not considered to be part of the internet address. <p> (* connect up the ISs *) [ 1 | 2, 3 ] := MsgItoI; [ 2 | 1, 4, 5 ] := MsgItoI; [ 3 | 1, 6, 7 ] := MsgItoI; [ 4 | 2, 8, 9 ] := MsgItoI; [ 5 | 2, 10, 11 ] := MsgItoI; <ref> [ 6 | 3, 12, 13 ] </ref> := MsgItoI; [ 7 | 3, 14, 15 ] := MsgItoI; [ 8 | 4 ] := MsgItoI; [ 9 | 4 ] := MsgItoI; [ 10 | 5 ] := MsgItoI; [ 11 | 5 ] := MsgItoI; [ 12 | 6 ]

Reference-contexts: The virtual network proposal allows an ES to retain the same network address as it relocates, but the proposal has a serious deficiency in that it requires the presence of a dynamic global database to identify an appropriate forwarder. Deering <ref> [14] </ref> proposed a scheme known as logical subnets. A logical subnet is treated as a single unit for Internet routing purposes, but it can span multiple physical subnetworks. A mobile ES is assigned an address on one of the logical subnets. <p> hierarchical, there are two possibilities: (a) The hierarchical address identifies the ES's current location, and changes every time that the ES moves. (b) The hierarchical address identifies the ES's home location; if necessary, the home address is translated to the hierarchical address of the ES's current location (cellular telephony, Deering <ref> [14] </ref>, Ioannidis, 44 Duchamp, and Maguire [27, 28], IETF [54], Wada, Yozawa, Ohnishi, and Tanaka [64], TUBA [21], and CDPD [10]). <p> 2, 3 ] := MsgItoI; [ 2 | 1, 4, 5 ] := MsgItoI; [ 3 | 1, 6, 7 ] := MsgItoI; [ 4 | 2, 8, 9 ] := MsgItoI; [ 5 | 2, 10, 11 ] := MsgItoI; [ 6 | 3, 12, 13 ] := MsgItoI; <ref> [ 7 | 3, 14, 15 ] </ref> := MsgItoI; [ 8 | 4 ] := MsgItoI; [ 9 | 4 ] := MsgItoI; [ 10 | 5 ] := MsgItoI; [ 11 | 5 ] := MsgItoI; [ 12 | 6 ] := MsgItoI; [ 13 | 6 ] := MsgItoI;

Reference-contexts: As in Sincoskie and Cotton [55], the forwarding pointer could be deleted after an idle timeout (during which no traffic had been for warded to the mobile ES). The entire cache of forwarding pointers at previous areas could be flushed periodically; this observation is due to Elliott <ref> [19] </ref>. Even if a forwarding pointer for a mobile ES remains at a previous area after the mobile ES's LSN has wrapped halfway around, it will not interfere with correct operation of the mobility algorithm.

Reference-contexts: It appears more likely that the network layer protocol eventually will be replaced with a "next generation" IP. One of the candidates for a "next generation" IP is the TUBA (TCP and UDP with Bigger Addresses) <ref> [21] </ref> proposal, which would replace the current IP with CLNP, the network layer protocol in the ISO OSI connectionless stack. Regardless of the fate of ISO OSI, we believe that this research, and the results obtained, will be useful to designers of future network protocols. <p> We believe that the method proposed by Tanaka and Tsukamoto is a promising technique for handling mobility within a single area. One of the candidates for a next generation IP is the TUBA <ref> [21, 50] </ref> proposal, which would replace IP with CLNP. TUBA includes enhancements to CLNP that would allow datagrams to be routed to mobile ESs. <p> time that the ES moves.

Reference-contexts: A message is sent back to the source process, so that the source can update its record of the destination's process address. In developing a generalized forwarding address, Fowler <ref> [22] </ref> extended the DEMOS/MP format to include a timestamp, which could be as simple as a count of the number of times that an object had relocated. <p> Figure 3.1 illustrates the basic hybrid address. A limited form of the hybrid address appeared in DEMOS/MP [48], in the context of process migration; a process address contained a unique ID and an identification of the last known machine that hosted the process. Fowler <ref> [22] </ref> extended the DEMOS/MP format to include a timestamp. In both DEMOS/MP and Fowler's work, message delivery is guaranteed as long as the process or object still exists; if necessary, a message will be forwarded one or more times.

Reference-contexts: The international telephone numbering plan is a successful example of wide-area hierarchical addressing and routing. A similar scheme was adopted for the AT&T Datakit <ref> [23] </ref>, except that address components are text strings separated by "/" characters. Unfortunately, having a topology-dependent address does introduce one significant limitation: if an ES relocates, its address must change.

Reference-contexts: Another problem is that many IS implementations process the LSRR option quite inefficiently, leading to significant overhead. A rather different approach to Internet mobility was taken by the designers of the Network Reconstitution Protocol <ref> [26] </ref>. Internet addresses used with the Network Reconstitution Protocol are redefined to contain a unique IS ID, and a unique ES ID; the protocol assumes IS-centric rather than network-centric routing. Datagrams are forwarded by the various ISs at which a mobile ES 26 has previously been located, but not indefinitely. <p> The Xerox Network System [13] uses a 48-bit flat internet address, along with a network number that is used as a routing hint; the network number, however, is not considered to be part of the internet address. Finally, 49 Internet addresses used with the Network Reconstitution Protocol <ref> [26] </ref> contain a unique IS ID, and a unique ES ID; only the IS ID changes as an ES relocates. Unlike the case of a strictly hierarchical address, if a datagram containing a hybrid address ends up at the wrong place, there are two possibilities: 1.

Reference-contexts: Although this allows for straightforward Internet routing, routing within the logical subnet will often be suboptimal. This is especially the case with "roaming" ESs, since datagrams must flow via the logical subnet's entry point, regardless of the ES's current location. The solution proposed by Ioannidis, Duchamp, and Maguire <ref> [27, 28] </ref> is essentially a hybrid of the Sunshine and Postel, and Deering schemes.

Although ESs on a PRNET often run the 36 Internet protocol suite, packet radio technology implements a general communication facility.

Reference-contexts: Also, having just a two-level routing hierarchy (subnetwork and ES) may ultimately limit internetwork size. Nevertheless, the Xerox approach to internetwork addressing appears to provide a reasonable base for support of ES mobility. 2.3.2 Sincoskie and Cotton Sincoskie and Cotton <ref> [55] </ref> outlined a network design that would route directly on link layer flat addresses. The network would be composed of a set of broadcast-capable subnetworks that are interconnected with link layer, self-learning bridges. <p> Alternatively, the internetwork may route directly on the flat address (Sincoskie and Cotton <ref> [55] </ref>). From the perspective of minimizing ES complexity, flat addresses are good in that the network address associated with a mobile ES never changes; that address can be recorded, and used whenever communication with the mobile ES is desired. <p> The mobile ES could be required to periodically send a Hello PDU to the previous area. After an interval of non-communication, the previous area could delete the forwarding pointer. As in Sincoskie and Cotton <ref> [55] </ref>, the forwarding pointer could be deleted after an idle timeout (during which no traffic had been for warded to the mobile ES). The entire cache of forwarding pointers at previous areas could be flushed periodically; this observation is due to Elliott [19]. <p> Note that even if the Rewrite message had not been received by ES1, ES1 would have learned ES2's current NSAP address upon receiving the Connection Confirm. 4.7 Comparison with Sincoskie and Cotton To some extent, one could view our mobility proposal as an extension of Sin-coskie and Cotton's <ref> [55] </ref> design. Relevant features of Sincoskie and Cotton's 74 design are summarized here, followed by a comparison with our proposal. In Sincoskie and Cotton, an address contains a unique ID only; there is no information that would partially identify the destination. <p> As long as all nodes along the way cache forwarding pointers to the new location, routing will be optimal. This observation is due to Sincoskie and Cotton <ref> [55] </ref>. The second parameter is that the source ES should be informed of the correct destination NSAP address in a timely manner. Here the principle is simple: the closer a forwarding pointer is to the source, in terms of routing hops, the faster the source will be informed.

Reference-contexts: The transport layer relies on the Internet address for ES identification; hence, the addresses of a pair of communicating ESs must remain constant for the lifetime of a transport connection. Sunshine and Postel <ref> [56] </ref> proposed a scheme known as virtual networks, where one Internet network number would be assigned to each mobile "community of interest." A mobile ES would be assigned an Internet address on the virtual network corresponding to the ES's community of interest, and would retain that address as it relocated.

Reference-contexts: Several aspects of Carlberg's proposal require a high degree of overhead. Two routing update messages will be sent each time that a mobile ES relocates to a different subnetwork within an area <ref> [57] </ref>. At the second level of the routing hierarchy, L2 ISs must directly track the location of each mobile IS that is present within the routing domain. <p> Finally, BISs must track the location of any mobile ESs that have correspondents in the local domain; this requires interactions with a global database. Tanaka and Tsukamoto <ref> [57] </ref> studied mobility only within a single ISO area, and developed a method using forwarding to more effectively support mobile ESs. Within an area, ES addresses are unique, and ES locations are tracked directly. <p> The frequency of such routing updates will eventually become burdensome as the number of mobile ESs in an area increases. A solution proposed by Tanaka and Tsukamoto <ref> [57] </ref> provides an approach to the problem, though one that only handles intra-area moves. The first L1 IS in an area to see a mobile ES declares itself to be the default neighbor IS of the ES, and advertises this information in an L1 routing update. <p> Second, the mobile ES needs to be able to contact an alternate L1 136 IS, in order to inform the home area of future ES relocations. We propose an extension to the Tanaka and Tsukamoto <ref> [57] </ref> solution that could handle the first sub-problem. In addition to advertising default neighbor designations, an L1 IS could advertise the current NSAP address associated with each ES for which it is acting as the default neighbor.

Reference-contexts: The hierarchical level is passed along unchanged; the real work is done on an IS's node number and neighbor list. The tool parses the input file, generates a connectivity matrix and verifies that all inter-node links are bidirectional. Then, the tool performs a SPF routing calculation (Dijkstra <ref> [58] </ref>), and verifies that the topology is not partitioned. Path length is calculated based solely on the number of routing hops.

Reference-contexts: As with the Deering proposal, the MSS uses tunneling to forward datagrams to and from the remote ES. The Ioanni-dis, Duchamp, and Maguire mobility approach is designed primarily to support mobility within one campus; roaming ESs are treated as a special case. Teraoka <ref> [59, 60, 61, 62] </ref> proposed a mobility scheme known as Virtual Internet Protocol, or VIP. In addition to carrying the home address of a mobile ES, a datagram header can include the current address of the ES. <p> Two variations are Teraoka <ref> [59, 60, 61, 62] </ref>, where a datagram header can optionally carry the hierarchical address of an ES's current location in addition to the address of the home location, and Perkins [43], where a datagram header can optionally specify a loose source route to the destination ES. 2. <p> Also, as mentioned in the previous section, examining and processing the source NSAP address of every datagram by a transit IS is too expensive, and must be eliminated from consideration. Note that the Teraoka <ref> [59, 60, 61, 62] </ref> proposal does require that transit ISs examine the source and destination NSAP address of every datagram. We have studied the remaining caching options; these are as follows.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the recovery procedure that Teraoka proposes is not entirely effective. An enhanced version of VIP by Uehara, Teraoka, Sunahara and Murai <ref> [63] </ref> attempts to circumvent some of the limitations of the original proposal. The enhanced VIP header has various control flags. In particular, it is possible to inhibit the updating of a datagram's destination address at ISs other than the destination ES's home IS. <p> SRC updates its cache entry for DEST and clears the "do not rewrite" bit upon receiving a datagram from DEST, or upon receiving a Rewrite message marked "original was rewrite by destination only." In their enhancements to VIP, Uehara and colleagues <ref> [63] </ref> independently proposed a control bit with similar semantics to our "rewrite by destination only" flag. The "rewrite by destination only" bit allows SRC to recover from the out-of-date cache entry stored at IS, but the mechanism does not necessarily cause that entry to be expunged permanently.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the mobile ES would need to tunnel datagrams back to its Home Agent. The proposal by Wada, Yozawa, Ohnishi, and Tanaka <ref> [64] </ref> contains elements of the IETF's proposal and also bears some similarity to Teraoka's VIP. The proposal describes two modes: forwarding and autonomous. Forwarding mode operates nearly identically to the version of the IETF's mechanism where datagrams are tunneled directly to a mobile ES's care-of-address. <p> changes every time that the ES moves. (b) The hierarchical address identifies the ES's home location; if necessary, the home address is translated to the hierarchical address of the ES's current location (cellular telephony, Deering [14], Ioannidis, 44 Duchamp, and Maguire [27, 28], IETF [54], Wada, Yozawa, Ohnishi, and Tanaka <ref> [64] </ref>, TUBA [21], and CDPD [10]).

Reference-contexts: Also, it is not certain whether it would be practical to update the database frequently enough to track the movement of a mobile ES. 2.6.3 ARDIS and RAM Mobile Data ARDIS <ref> [1, 2, 65] </ref> is a wireless data network in the United States that is owned and operated by Motorola. ARDIS is designed for the transmission of short, 40 bursty, interactive traffic. Message delivery is guaranteed, and occurs approximately 4 to 10 seconds after transmission. <p> A message can be sent between two subscriber units, or between a subscriber unit and a customer-owned computer. Full-duplex bandwidth over the wireless links is currently 4800 bits per second. Selected geographic regions are being upgraded to 19,200 bits per second, in order to increase channel capacity <ref> [65] </ref>. The ARDIS network is hierarchically organized and centrally routed. There are approximately 35,000 subscribers, 1350 base stations, 30 network control processors, and 2 message switches (the second message switch is for redundancy).
