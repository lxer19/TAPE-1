Title: Supporting Information Retrieval via Matchmaking

Abstract: The massive increase in information available via electronic networks is placing severe burdens on traditional methods of information sharing and retrieval. Matchmaking proposes an intelligent facilitation agent that accepts machine-readable requests and advertisements from information consumers and providers, and determines potential information sharing paths. Matchmaking permits large numbers of dynamic consumers and providers, operating on rapidly-changing data, to locate and share information effectively. This paper introduces matchmaking, as enabled by knowledge sharing standards like KQML, and gives a brief description of the the SHADE and COINS matchmakers. In addition, several applications are described to illustrate the utility of matchmaking for information retrieval.

Reference-contexts: The SHADE and COINS Matchmakers To evaluate and test the matchmaking approach, we have built two prototype matchmakers, the SHADE and COINS matchmakers, implemented as KQML-speaking agents. KQML, the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language <ref> (Finin et al. 1993) </ref>, is an emerging standard that defines a number of perfor-matives (message types) for information exchange, such as tell, broker, and subscribe. The term agent is used to refer to a semi-autonomous tool or program, possibly under the guidance of a human, that interacts with other agents.

Reference-contexts: Requests are sent using the recommend, recruit, and broker per-formatives. The matchmaker also supports content-based routing, where tells from providers are forwarded according to subscribes sent by consumers. As it's content language, the SHADE matchmaker supports two logic-based representations: a subset of KIF <ref> (Genesereth & Fikes 1992) </ref> and a structured logic representation called MAX (Kuokka 1990) augmented to support string patterns as terms. KIF is supported since it provides an expressive, standardized shared language with well-defined semantics.

Reference-contexts: These participants use a variety of tools that consume and produce complex engineering information, such as the SDRC I-DEAS solid modeler, Mat-lab, Mathematica, and the Lockheed Parameter Manager <ref> (Kuokka & Livezey 1994) </ref> and Project Coordination Assistant (PCA) (Kuokka 1994). <p> These participants use a variety of tools that consume and produce complex engineering information, such as the SDRC I-DEAS solid modeler, Mat-lab, Mathematica, and the Lockheed Parameter Manager (Kuokka & Livezey 1994) and Project Coordination Assistant (PCA) <ref> (Kuokka 1994) </ref>. Rather than attempting to hardwire into these tools all the potential transfer paths for information (which would be impossible in general due to the dynamic nature of engineering teams), these tools use the SHADE matchmaker to advertise and subscribe their information capabilities and needs.

Reference-contexts: Thus, highly relevant information, which might otherwise never have been discovered, would be brought to the attention of the Systems Engineer. The matchmaker has been used by several other engineering-related projects as well. The Cosmos project <ref> (Mark & Dukes-Schlossberg 1994) </ref>, which is creating a knowledge-based commitment reasoner to determine impacts of engineering changes, uses the matchmaker to provide indirection between a set of dynamic clients and the server.

Reference-contexts: Clearinghouses, such as Commercenet and MCC's EINet Galaxy, are central servers at which individual information providers can register. Since there are relatively few clearinghouses, and they are organized in some fashion (and are usually searchable), consumers are able to effectively locate desired information. Exploration services, such as Ly-cos <ref> (Mauldin & Leavitt 1994) </ref> and the World Wide Web Worm (McBryan 1994), "crawl" the network compiling a master index. The index can then be used as the basis for keyword searches much like a manually-created clearinghouse.

These approaches provide very useful solutions to the overflow of information, but several problems remain.

Reference-contexts: However, the content language is unconstrained free-text (or optionally, preprocessed concept vectors to reduce the message size). To determine if a request matches an advertisement, the content of each message is converted into a con cept vector (a weighed list of stemmed words in the document) using the SMART <ref> (Salton 1989) </ref> information retrieval system. The SMART matching algorithm is then used to determine the degree of match. Finally, an adjustable cutoff measure is used to make the match binary. Thus, other than supporting a different content language, the COINS matchmaker works much like the SHADE matchmaker.

Reference-contexts: The term agent is used to refer to a semi-autonomous tool or program, possibly under the guidance of a human, that interacts with other agents. Other researchers are also working on communicating agents that perform many matchmaking services, such as the ABSI facilitator <ref> (Singh 1993) </ref>. The SHADE matchmaker was designed and pro totyped as part of the SHADE system (Kuokka et al. 1994; McGuire et al. 1993), an effort to define a knowledge-level communication infrastructure for engineering. The SHADE matchmaker handles a variety of KQML performatives. Advertisements are sent using the advertise performative.
