Abstract: We develop an algorithm for solving a diophantine equation with lower and upper bounds on the variables. The algorithm is based on lattice basis reduction, and first finds short vectors satisfying the diophantine equation. The next step is to branch on linear combinations of these vectors, which either yields a vector that satisfies the bound constraints or provides a proof that no such vector exists. The research was motivated by the need for solving constrained diophantine equations as subproblems when designing integrated circuits for video signal processing. Our algorithm is tested with good result on real-life data.

Reference-contexts: One such example is the Frobenius problem that was recently considered by Cornuejols, Urbaniak, Weismantel and Wolsey <ref> [3] </ref>. The instances related to video signal processing were difficult to tackle by linear programming (LP) based branch-and-bound due to the characteristics of the input. In order to explain the structure of these fl aardal@cs.ruu.nl. Department of Computer Science, Utrecht University. <p> The number a 0 is called the Frobenius number. The instances considered by Cornuejols et al. <ref> [3] </ref> were also hard to solve using LP-based branch-and-bound. They developed a test set approach that was successful on their instances. When solving a feasibility problem such as (1) by LP-based branch-and-bound, two difficulties may arise. <p> Eight of the instances were feasible and five infeasible. The instances starting with "P" in Table 1 were obtained from Philips Research Labs. The instances starting with "F" are the Frobenius instances of Cornuejols et al. <ref> [3] </ref>. Here we used the Frobenius number as right-hand side a 0 . The two other instances, starting with "E", were derived from F3 and F4. The information in Table 1 is interpreted as follows.

Reference-contexts: It is obviously a serious drawback that the algorithm terminates with an infeasible solution. To overcome the mentioned deficiencies we have developed an algorithm based on the L 3 basis reduction algorithm as developed by Lenstra, Lenstra and Lovasz <ref> [9] </ref>. The motivation behind choosing basis reduction as a core of our algorithm is twofold. First, basis reduction allows us to work directly with integers, which avoids the round-off problems. Second, basis reduction finds short, nearly orthogonal vectors belonging to the lattice described by the basis. <p> The vectors b fl j ; 1 j n and the real numbers jk ; 1 k &lt; j n are defined inductively by: b fl j1 X jk b fl jk = (b j ) T b fl k ) T b fl Lenstra, Lenstra and Lovasz <ref> [9] </ref> used the following definition of a reduced basis: Definition 2 A basis b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b n is reduced if j jk j 2 and j + j;j1 b fl 3 jjb fl The vector b fl j is the projection of b <p> The constant 3 4 in inequality (6) is arbitrarily chosen and can be replaced by any fixed real number 1 4 &lt; y &lt; 1. Lenstra et al. <ref> [9] </ref> developed a polynomial time algorithm for obtaining a reduced basis for a lattice given an initial basis. The algorithm consists of a sequence of size reductions and interchanges as described below.

The algorithm consists of a sequence of size reductions and interchanges as described below. For the precise algorithm we refer to [9]. Size reduction: If for any pair of indices i; j : 1 k &lt; j n condition (5) is violated, then replace b j by b j d jk cb k , where d jk c is the integer nearest to jk . <p> Lovasz and Scarf's definition of a reduced basis is a generalization of the definition given by Lenstra et al <ref> [9] </ref>.

Lemma 1 (Lenstra, Lenstra, Lovasz <ref> [9] </ref>) Let fl R n be a lattice with reduced basis b 1 ; b 2 ; : : : ; b n 2 R n . Let y 1 ; y 2 ; : : : ; y t 2 fl be linearly independent.

Reference-contexts: Interchange: If condition (6) is violated for an index j; 1 &lt; j n, then inter change vectors b j1 and b j . Basis reduction was introduced in integer programming by H.W. Lenstra, Jr. <ref> [10] </ref>, who showed that the problem of determining if there exists a vector x 2 Z n such that Ax d can be solved in polynomial time when n is fixed. Before this result was published, only the cases n = 1; 2 were known to be polynomially solvable.

Reference-contexts: This implies that vectors formed by the columns of E 0 2 all belong to N (A). We can check, in polynomial time, whether the system Ax = d has a feasible solution by deriving the Hermite normal form of A, see for instance Schrijver <ref> [16] </ref>, Chapter 5.3. Once we have obtained the vector x d as described in Theorem 4, we can check if it satisfies the bound constraints.
