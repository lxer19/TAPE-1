Abstract: Multicast transport protocols have been an area of active research for the past couple of years. This document tries to summarize the activities in this work-in-progress area by surveying several multicast transport protocols. The paper also presents a taxonomy to classify the surveyed protocols according to several distinct features, discusses the rationale behind the protocol's design decisions, and presents some current research issues in multicast protocol design.

Reference-contexts: XTP offers both window- and rate-based flow control. XTP's rate-based flow control allows a receiver to dynamically pace a transmitter using a rate and burst control parameters, which together establish the inter-packet gap. Uniform Reliable Group Communication Protocol The Uniform Reliable Group Communication (URGC) protocol <ref> [1] </ref> provides reliable and ordered communication among the members of a group. To achieve ordering and decide when to purge old messages, URGC uses centralized control, which rotates among all members of the group.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the current token site can purge all messages whose timestamps are earlier than the last time this site had the token. Multicast Transport Protocol Influenced by RBP, the Multicast Transport Protocol (MTP) <ref> [2] </ref> provides reliable and globally ordered delivery of client data among a group of communicating processes. MTP is built on top of IP multicasting, and provides strong consistency by multicasting messages under centralized control. One of the participating processes is assigned to be the group master.

Reference-contexts: As a real-time data distribution protocol, RTP tries to avoid packet loss, since once a packet in a real-time data stream is lost, there is not much use in retransmitting it. The control mechanism for real-time transmission proposed in <ref> [3] </ref> has been implemented as part of the IVS videoconferencing system [36]. It uses the RTP and RTCP suite to carry QoS information. Using the proposed control mechanism, video sources perform probabilistic polling to select a set of receivers that should provide feedback.

Reference-contexts: They also differ in how they define their data and control packet formats. 4 3.2 Support for Multipoint Interactive Applications Multicast Transport Protocol-2 After their experience implementing and using MTP to support the X window sharing tool Xy, C. Bormann et. al. designed MTP-2 <ref> [4] </ref>, a variant of the original MTP. Their goal was to address the requirements of tools to support remote collaboration, such as teleconferencing services.

Reference-contexts: Logging servers decide whether they should multicast or unicast a lost packet based on the number of ACKs they get. Reliable Adaptive Multicast Protocol The Reliable Adaptive Multicast Protocol (RAMP)'s original design <ref> [5] </ref> has been extended to operate in an all-optical, circuit-switched, gigabit network environment [20]. RAMP is layered on top of a network-layer multicast protocol, such as IP multicast, and provides NACK-based reliable delivery. A RAMP sender starts by sending a connect message to an IP multicast address.

Reference-contexts: TRM also uses probabilistic suppression to limit the amount of retransmissions. 1 A RAMP receiver may choose to operate in unreliable mode, in which they ignore message loss. 6 3.3 Support for Data Dissemination Services Muse Muse [22] was developed to multicast news articles on the MBONE <ref> [6] </ref>. The Muse transmitter accepts a news article through a standard NNTP [18] interaction. Thus for other news feeds, an Muse feed looks just like an NNTP feed.

Reference-contexts: RBP, MTP, RMP, and URGC are all message-oriented protocols but were not designed for a specific application. Reliable Broadcast Protocol The Reliable Broadcast Protocol (RBP) <ref> [7] </ref> provides multipoint communication between sites connected by a local-area broadcast network. RBP combines negative and positive acknowledgments to achieve reliability, ordering, and fault tolerance. Messages are multicast to the group through the token site. In other words, the token site multicasts an ACK for each message it receives.

Tennenhouse. </author> <title> Architectural considerations for a new generation of protocols. </title> <booktitle> Proc. of the Conference on Communications Architectures, Protocols, and Applications, ACM SIGCOMM 1990, </booktitle> <month> September </month> <year> 1990. </year>
Reference-contexts: Therefore a TCP-like solution for the multicast case is not possible: a single, generic protocol simply cannot meet the requirements of all types of multicast applications. This protocol design model was first referred to as Application Layer Framing <ref> [8] </ref>. We observe that most of the more recently proposed multicast transport mechanisms have been designed with a specific application in mind. For instance, several existing multicast transport protocols address the requirements of delay-sensitive, real-time services, such as multimedia conferencing tools.
Reference: [9] <author> GlobalCast Communications. </author> <title> Globalcast communications reliable multicast protocols. </title> <address> http://www.gcast.com/reliablemulticast.html. </address>
Reference-contexts: When a sender receives a NACK, it treats it just like an expired timer and backs off exponentially. RMP is one of the reliable multicast protocols developed and being commercialized by GlobalCast Communications <ref> [9] </ref>. GlobalCast also developed SRM and RMTP, and provides a common API that interfaces to this family of reliable multicast products.

Reference-contexts: In the closed and limited open group cases, group membership is known by the source. This is not the case in the unlimited open group model. MFTP is a product developed by StarBurst Communications <ref> [10] </ref> and supports StarBurst's family of multipoint file transfer software. 3.4 Interactivity versus Reliability Interactive and dissemination services differ in their delivery delay (or delay variance) and reliability requirements.

Reference-contexts: Joining sites announce their presence by multicasting a join packet to the group. Currently, MDP does not have any mechanism to prevent late comers from requesting retransmission of old packets. Adaptive File Distribution Protocol Like MDP, the Adaptive File Distribution Protocol (AFDP) <ref> [11] </ref> provides a reliable file distribution service on top of UDP. AFDP senders, or publishers send data to AFDP subscribers. A special subscriber in a group, or the group's secretary, is responsible for managing group membership, authorizing publishers, and determining the appropriate transmission mode to be used.

Reference-contexts: This taxonomy is based on how the data buffering mechanism at the source interacts with the error and congestion control mechanisms. Reference lists of multicast protocol related publications can be found in [27, 19]. Reliable multicast frameworks listing important features in reliable multicast protocol design are presented in <ref> [12, 38] </ref>. 2 Taxonomy We classify multicast transport protocols according to the following features. * Data Propagation: mechanism used to propagate data (not control information) among participating sites. * Reliability Mechanism: how the protocol recovers from data loss. * Repair Request: how the protocol requests retransmission of lost data. * Feedback <p> The idea is that instead of a specific protocol targeted at a specific class of reliable multicast applications, a framework for reliable multicast can be used to develop a variety of multicast protocols for applications with different requirements. Both RMF <ref> [12] </ref> and RMFP [38] define frameworks for implementing reliable multicast protocols. While RMF introduces the notion of a universal receiver which is able to operate with any sender using self-identifying packets, RMFP is based on RTP-style profiles.

Reference-contexts: Each layer is sent to a different multicast address. Receivers choose their receiving rate by joining/leaving the appropriate multicast groups. The more layers receivers subscribe, the faster they receive the data. Our representative-based congestion control mechanism <ref> [13] </ref> uses a small, dynamic set of group members, or representatives, to provide timely feedback on behalf of congested subtrees of a multicast distribution tree.

Reference-contexts: If the size of the group is under a pre-defined threshold, receivers NACK when they detect packet loss. The sender encodes the blocks contained in the lost packet, and sends them to the group. Scalable Reliable Multicast Wb, the distributed whiteboard tool presented in <ref> [14] </ref>, uses the Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) transport protocol to reliably distribute data among all participating sites. Participants multicast NACKs to request retransmission of lost data, which can be answered by any member that has the information.

Reference-contexts: To avoid feedback implosion, multicast protocols should provide some form of feedback control, i.e., a mechanism that restricts the amount of feedback generated by the multicast group. In <ref> [15] </ref>, solutions to the feedback implosion problem are classified as structure-based or timer-based. Another classification based on how to limit the amount of feedback generated by group members is proposed in [21].

Reference-contexts: Session messages are also used to measure RTT between members, which are used to set the suppression timers. 5 Log-Based Receiver-Reliable Multicast The Log-Based Receiver-Reliable Multicast protocol (LBRM) <ref> [16] </ref> uses a logging server to log all packets transmitted by the source and to retransmit lost packets. The source keeps data that has already been sent until it gets an ACK from the logging server.

Reference-contexts: RMP's name service uses the RMP protocol to manage its distributed database. RMP's group membership protocol allows sites to join or leave a group and updates the members' group membership view accordingly. 3 RMP's flow and congestion control mechanism uses the algorithms Van Jacobson developed for TCP <ref> [17] </ref>. Each sender in a group keeps a sliding window regulated by retransmission timers, NACKs from receivers, and positive acknowledgments ACKs from the token site. A sender uses slow-start to increase its window size by 1 packet every time an ACK is received.

Reference-contexts: Other Sources A survey and taxonomy that focus on reliable multicast transport protocols can be found in [34]. In <ref> [21] </ref>, five different classes of multicast protocols are identified, namely: sender-initiated, receiver-initiated, receiver-initiated with NACK avoidance, tree-based, and ring-based protocols.

Another classification based on how to limit the amount of feedback generated by group members is proposed in <ref> [21] </ref>. In the first classification, structure-based approaches rely on a designated site (either a dedicated server in the case of the LBRM Protocol or a pre-assigned group member) to process and filter feedback information. The second classification provides a more general definition of structure-based feedback control.

Reference-contexts: Any group member, including the source, can retransmit the missing data. TRM also uses probabilistic suppression to limit the amount of retransmissions. 1 A RAMP receiver may choose to operate in unreliable mode, in which they ignore message loss. 6 3.3 Support for Data Dissemination Services Muse Muse <ref> [22] </ref> was developed to multicast news articles on the MBONE [6].

Reference-contexts: A session directory service provides primitives for creating, deleting, joining, and leaving a multicast group. However, knowledge of group membership is not assumed. Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol The Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol (RMTP) <ref> [23] </ref> supports reliable 1-to-many bulk data delivery. Like TMTP, RMTP addresses feedback implosion by organizing group members into a control tree, which governs feedback propagation and processing.

Reference-contexts: Muse control messages include a keep-alive message that is multicast to the group if no articles have been sent during a pre-specified period. Muse relies on NNTP or any reliable news propagation protocol for out-of-band recovery of lost articles. Multicast Dissemination Protocol The Multicast Dissemination Protocol (MDP) <ref> [24] </ref> provides a reliable multicast framework for file distribution. MDP evolved from IMM, the image multicaster, used in disseminating satellite image files over the MBone.

Reference-contexts: Since providing congestion control mechanisms is critical in enabling reliable multicast transport protocols to be deployed on the Internet, it has been considered a priority area by the IRTF Reliable Multicast working group. Only a few few existing multicast transport protocols implement explicit congestion control. Layered Multicast <ref> [25] </ref> addresses the congestion problem in the context of video stream multicast transmission, an example application that can tolerate data loss. Streams are decomposed into several layers. Encoding is done such that the composition of layers leads to higher quality video.

Reference-contexts: Lucent Technologies' e-cast [35] reliable multicast product family is based on RMTP. The Multicast File Transfer Protocol StarBurst's Multicast File Transfer Protocol (MFTP) <ref> [26] </ref> is another multicast protocol that supports reliable 1-to-many data transmission. The MFTP source may operate in unicast, multicast or broadcast mode depending on what kind of information is being sent and what transmission modes are supported by the network. The MFTP client is able to handle any transmission mode.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, there is a tradeoff between the overhead in processing (both at the sender and at the receiver) and transmitting redundant data and the ability to recover from losses without having to request retransmissions and retransmit lost packets.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, in the receiver-initiated approach to reliability, receivers detect packet losses and request its retrans mission by generating a negative acknowledgment (NACK). Placing the responsibility of recovering from packet losses on the receiver helps alleviate the ACK implosion problem. The performance comparison study presented in <ref> [29] </ref> confirms that receiver-initiated multicast transport protocols deliver better performance than their sender-initiated counterparts. Most reliable multipoint transport protocols are either pure receiver-initiated or use a hybrid approach by com bining receiver- and sender-initiated reliability. Except for RTP, all surveyed protocols offered reliable delivery.

Reference-contexts: As congestion is detected at the receiver via packet loss, the receiver unsubscribes to higher bandwidth groups. Periodically, receivers that are not experiencing congestion, join higher bandwidth groups to take advantage of available network bandwidth. The congestion control mechanism for bulk-data transfer applications presented in <ref> [37] </ref> uses forward error correction (FEC) techniques to stripe the data into multiple, cumulative, redundant layers. Each layer is sent to a different multicast address. Receivers choose their receiving rate by joining/leaving the appropriate multicast groups. The more layers receivers subscribe, the faster they receive the data.

While RMF introduces the notion of a universal receiver which is able to operate with any sender using self-identifying packets, RMFP is based on RTP-style profiles.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the more retransmissions, the less new packets are injected into the group. Reliable Multicast Protocol The Reliable Multicast Protocol (RMP) <ref> [39] </ref> provides a totally ordered, reliable multipoint transport protocol on top of an unreliable multicast service. Like MTP, RMP evolved from RBP. Besides using multicast where available, RMP extended RBP with a name service that advertises the existence of multicast groups, and a flow and congestion control mechanism.

Reference-contexts: For instance, in IETF broadcasts, there are usually many more passive participants than active ones. Passive receivers would rather have high playback quality which can be achieved by delayed playback combined with retransmissions. Structure-Oriented Resilient Multicast Like TMTP and RMTP, the Structured-Oriented Resilient Multicast (STORM) <ref> [40] </ref> protocol performs error recovery by organizing group members into a dynamic distribution graph (not necessarily a tree). A group member keeps a list of parent nodes and as soon as it notices a packet loss, it unicasts a NACK to each parent at a time.

Reference-contexts: AFDP allows sites to join and leave a distribution group by contacting the group's secretary, but does not provide a recovery mode to handle site failures or network partitions. 7 Tree-Based Multicast Transport Protocol The goal of the Tree-Based Multicast Protocol (TMTP) <ref> [41] </ref> is to provide reliable multicast communication support for 1-to-many bulk data dissemination applications 2 . For error and flow control, TMTP organizes group members into a control tree. Each subtree, or domain is represented by its root, or the domain manager. Domains typically correspond to subnets. <p> Using the data transmission protocol, the MFTP sender announces a file transfer session periodically during the announcement phase. In response to announcements, clients register to receive the file MFTP sends data in passes: in the first pass, it sends the entire 2 In <ref> [41] </ref>, the authors refer to dissemination services in the context of interactive applications. 8 file at a pre-defined transmission rate. In subsequent passes, the server retransmits lost packets.
