Reference: 1. <editor> The exception bound to the outer exn is distinct from that bound to the inner exn thus the exception raised by f(200), </editor> <title> 94 PPEN I . NS E S with excepted value 200, could only be handled by a handler within the scope of the inner exception declaration it will not be handled by the handler in the program, which expects a boolean value. So this exception will be reported at top level. This would apply even if the outer exception declaration were also of type int the two exceptions bound to exn would still be distinct. </title>

Joachim Parrow, Don Sannella, and David Walker made many helpful suggestions. vii te nt o tion These notes are an introduction to the Standard ML programming language. Here are some of the highlights of Standard ML: * ML is a functional programming language.
