Abstract: The multihop approach to lightwave networks makes it possible to create networks that offer hundreds of thousands of gigabits-per-second total capacity, shared among many users, with each user limited to a peak rate that can be supported by electronic interfaces. The optical passive star has emerged as the physical medium of choice for supporting various virtual topologies. The Shu*e-net is a well known virtual topology, involving wrapped around connections between the last and first stages of the network, that can be supported on an optical passive star. In this paper, we introduce the idea of providing reverse channels in such networks with minimal hardware costs, to reduce the network diameter, improve average delay and provide other advantages. The reverse channel idea can be applied to any multistage network with wrapped around connections, e.g., the MIN or the Butterfly networks. We demonstrate the advantages of reverse channels by providing a simple reverse connection between adjacent stages of the Shu*e-net. Time and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (TWDM) is then used to provide the media access protocol for the nodes in the network. The benefits of using reverse channels in Shu*e-net are shown via simulation and bounds on network performance metrics are derived analytically. We show how a TWDM protocol for the Shu*e-net can be easily adapted for the Reverse Channel Augmented Shu*e-net (RC-Shu*e-net). The addition of a reverse channel is shown to be beneficial in a large network with significant propagation delays, such as a MAN. We highlight several issues for further research using this idea. fl Supported by a Graduate Fellowship from the International Business Machines Corp.

Reference-contexts: This will require routing through intermediate nodes, each repeating the packet on a new wavelength, until the packet is finally transmitted on a wavelength that can be received by the ultimate destination. We call such networks mul-tihop networks <ref> [1] </ref>. The assignment of transmit and receive wavelengths to each node's transmitter and receiver results in a virtual topology on top of the physical topology. In the past, several virtual topologies have been proposed for multihop networks for optical stars and busses [19, 7, 10].

Reference-contexts: In our case, each transmitter has exactly one chance to transmit during a cycle. We presently ignore the effects of synchronization of the time slots with respect to the star center. Synchronization problems with TWDM protocols are highlighted in <ref> [3] </ref>. Variations in the distances of the nodes from the star center have no effect on the operation of the protocol. We present several methods of adapting a TWDM protocol for the Shu*e-net to the proposed topology.

Reference-contexts: Technological constraints however limit the number of available wavelengths to a modest number even though theoretically there can be a large number of wavelengths. For tunable receivers and transmitters, this range is further restricted <ref> [4] </ref>. The tunable range of a transmitter or receiver is inversely related to its tuning speed. Thus pure WDM offers only limited multiplexing capabilities. The number of stations attached to an optical passive star will usually far exceed the number of wavelength channels. <p> This will constrain the protocol severely. Also, rapidly tunable devices add to the hardware cost significantly not to mention that the range of tunability is limited by the tuning speed. <ref> [4] </ref>. Method 4 : Use of a tunable transmitter and a fixed receiver at each node In this method, a transmitter will first transmit on its allocated wavelength in the forward direction and later transmit on another wavelength in the reverse direction.

Reference-contexts: The light signals entering the star are evenly divided among all the outgoing fibers such that a transmission from any node is receivable by all the nodes in the network. Passive stars present the advantage of smaller power losses as compared to linear optical busses <ref> [5] </ref>. This leads to greater network sizes. Moreover, the operation of the network is completely passive which provides greater reliability. The broadcast nature of the optical star can be exploited to build virtual topologies with smaller average delays [21].

Reference-contexts: The time slots are arranged into repeating cycles. In each cycle, a node gets to transmit a fixed number of times (usually once) on a a preassigned wavelength and time slot.

Shu*e-net and other regular virtual topologies have the benefits of simplistic routing and scalability and are well studied under the class of interconnection networks for multiprocessor architectures [11]. <p> Thus the entire network can be thought of as being wrapped around a cylinder. This is not necessarily so with multiprocessor interconnection networks. The Shu*e-net <ref> [10] </ref> topology has been proposed for interconnecting nodes in a high-speed local or metropolitan area network. In the Shu*e-net N = kp k nodes are arranged in k columns 3 of p k nodes each. <p> Obviously, not all k p k nodes of the Shu*e-net can be reached via this spanning tree. Hence a second pass is required. The need for the second pass results in a diameter of (2k 1) for the Shu*e-net <ref> [10] </ref>. 5 In this paper we attempt to reduce the diameter of a Shu*e-net with the introduction of reverse channels, represented by directed arcs connecting a node to another in the adjacent column to its left. <p> Routing Algorithm : Routing in the RC-Shu*e-net is described in terms of three algorithms. The algorithm Shu*e-Forward determines whether or not to forward a packet given the destination address, by the regular Shu*e route, as described in <ref> [10] </ref>. Algorithm Is-Reverse-Needed, given a source-destination pair, determines whether or not the use of a reverse channel is required. In this subroutine, we first calculate the number of hops required to route the packet from the source to destination using regular Shu*e routing. <p> The ideal diameter is obtained from a p-ary ((p + 1)-ary) spanning tree for the Shu*e-net (proposed topology). This metric has been used previously <ref> [10, 19] </ref> for comparing different topologies. <p> The ideal diameter is obtained from a p-ary ((p + 1)-ary) spanning tree for the Shu*e-net (proposed topology). This metric has been used previously [10, 19] for comparing different topologies. The ideal diameter (hops), H, of an N node network determined by a p-ary spanning tree <ref> [10] </ref> is : H = dlog p (1 + N (p 1))e 1, p 2 We denote the ideal diameter of a (p + 1)-ary N node network by H fl which can be evaluated by substituting (p+1) for p in the above equation. <p> It is the easiest to adapt and incurs minimal hardware increments. With Method 1, the Shu*e-net transmission schedule can be used with absolutely no modification save for the need for assigning a receive wavelength to the second receiver. All the other methods are more complicated. In <ref> [10] </ref> it is shown that a TWDM protocol with multiple transmitters and receivers per node can be supported. Given a Shu*e-net transmission schedule for a TWDM protocol using m transmitters and n receivers, a TWDM protocol for the RC-Shu*e-net can be supported with m transmitters and n + 1 receivers.

Shu*e-net and other regular virtual topologies have the benefits of simplistic routing and scalability and are well studied under the class of interconnection networks for multiprocessor architectures <ref> [11] </ref>. In addition, regular topologies like the hypercube [18], and the perfect-shu*e [20] can embed other well known topologies such as linear arrays, unidirectional and bi-directional rings meshes and trees. <p> This design is similar to that of a multistage interconnection network commonly employed in multiprocessor architectures <ref> [11] </ref> with two differences : 1) In a n log p n interconnection network for multiprocessors, n nodes are interconnected via a switching fabric made of log p n stages of n=p (p fi p) switching elements. Most commonly p = 2. <p> In the Shu*e-net N = kp k nodes are arranged in k columns 3 of p k nodes each. Each column is connected to the next one by p k+1 directed arcs in a fixed p-shu*e pattern <ref> [20, 11] </ref> with the last column connected to the first one in a wrapped around fashion.

However this is an ideal situation and is far from reality <ref> [13] </ref>. Thus, the addition of the reverse channel results in a significant reduction in mean packet delay, an important parameter of network performance.

Reference-contexts: Such topologies can be easily supported as virtual topologies on an optical passive star. The assignment of wavelengths to the nodes' transmitters and receivers defines the virtual topology. In this section we demonstrate how a TWDM media access protocol for the Shu*e-net <ref> [17] </ref> can be easily adapted for the RC-Shu*e-net, in several ways. We discuss the tradeoffs therein. TWDM media access schemes use wavelength division multiplexing and then time division multiplexing within each wavelength channel. Our goal is to design a protocol with minimal hardware requirements at each node. <p> In a related work <ref> [17] </ref>, we have developed a methodology to support TWDM media access protocols for k fi p k lightwave network topologies. In [17], we present a set of formal properties and constraints for 17 such access schemes and develop algorithms for wavelength and slot assignment for the transceivers. <p> In a related work <ref> [17] </ref>, we have developed a methodology to support TWDM media access protocols for k fi p k lightwave network topologies. In [17], we present a set of formal properties and constraints for 17 such access schemes and develop algorithms for wavelength and slot assignment for the transceivers. Here, however, we restrict our attention to the adaptation of a Shu*e-net transmission schedule for the RC-Shu*e-net. <p> Since the receivers stay fixed, with two transmissions now needed per node, the cycle time will have to be doubled. This is applicable only if the propagation delays are so high as to 6 This and several other observations can be found in <ref> [17] </ref> 19 offset this increase in cycle time. Again, tunable transmitters will bring forth problems of tunability range and tuning speeds. Clearly, Method 1 is preferable over the other three. It is the easiest to adapt and incurs minimal hardware increments. <p> We derive the channel efficiency through simulation and plot the capacity curves for networks of 24 (k = 3), 64 (k = 4) and 160 (k = 5) nodes keeping p constant (= 2). In <ref> [17] </ref> we have shown that the number of wavelengths, W , that can be employed in a k fi p k network such as a Shu*e-net is given by a fi b where a is a factor of p k and 1 a &lt; a and b is a factor of
