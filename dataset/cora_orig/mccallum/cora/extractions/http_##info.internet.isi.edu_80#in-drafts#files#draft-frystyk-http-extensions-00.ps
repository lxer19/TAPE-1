Abstract: This document is an Internet-Draft. Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts. Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress". Abstract HTTP is used increasingly in applications that need more facilities than the standard version of the protocol provides, ranging from distributed authoring, collaboration, and printing, to various remote procedure call mechanisms. This document proposes the use of a mandatory extension mechanism designed to address the tension between private agreement and public specification and to accommodate extension of applications such as HTTP clients, servers, and proxies. The proposal associates each extension with a URI[2], and use a few new RFC 822[1] style header fields to carry the extension identifier and related information between the parties involved in an extended transaction.

Reference-contexts: INTERNET-DRAFT Mandatory Friday, August 07, 1998 Frystyk, et al [Page 3] This proposal does not rely on particular features defined in URLs [3] that cannot potentially be expressed using URNs (see section 9). Therefore, the more generic term URI <ref> [2] </ref> is used throughout the specification. 3. Extension Declarations An extension declaration can be used to indicate that an extension has been applied to a message and possibly to reserve a part of the header namespace identified by a header field prefix (see 3.1).

Reference-contexts: Extension identifier URIs can be either relative or absolute. Relative extension identifiers MUST specify header-fields defined in an IETF RFC (see RFC 1808 <ref> [4] </ref>). Examples of extension declarations are "Content-FooBar" "New-Registered-Header" "http://www.temporary.com/extension"; ns=33 An extension declaration can be extended through the use of one or more ext-extension parameters.

Reference-contexts: This opens the host party to a variety of "Trojan horse" attacks by the provider, or a malicious third party that forges implementations under a provider's name. See, for example RFC2046 <ref> [6] </ref>, section 4.5.2 for a discussion of these risks.

Reference-contexts: Notational Conventions This specification uses the same notational conventions and basic parsing constructs as RFC 2068 <ref> [7] </ref>. In particular the BNF constructs "token", "quoted-string", "field-name", and "URI" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2068 [7]. <p> Notational Conventions This specification uses the same notational conventions and basic parsing constructs as RFC 2068 <ref> [7] </ref>. In particular the BNF constructs "token", "quoted-string", "field-name", and "URI" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2068 [7]. The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [9]. <p> That is, the header fields are to be included as Connection header directives (see section <ref> [7] </ref>, section 14.10). An agent MUST NOT send the C-Man or the C-Opt header field to an HTTP/1.0 proxy as it does not obey the HTTP/1.1 rules for parsing the Connection header field (see [7]). 5. <p> That is, the header fields are to be included as Connection header directives (see section <ref> [7] </ref>, section 14.10). An agent MUST NOT send the C-Man or the C-Opt header field to an HTTP/1.0 proxy as it does not obey the HTTP/1.1 rules for parsing the Connection header field (see [7]). 5. Mandatory HTTP Requests An HTTP request is called a mandatory request if it includes at least one mandatory extension declaration (using the Man or the C-Man header fields). The method name of a mandatory request MUST be prefixed by "M-". <p> An HTTP server MUST NOT return a 2xx status-code without understanding and obeying all mandatory extension declaration (s) in a mandatory request. A mandatory HTTP request invalidates cached entries as described in <ref> [7] </ref>, section 13.10. The ultimate recipient of a mandatory HTTP request with the "M-" prefix on the method name MUST process the request by performing the following actions in the order they are listed below: 1. <p> If the evaluation in 3) is successful (not resulting in a 510 (Not Extended) status code) then strip the "M-" prefix from the method name and process the reminder of the request according to the semantics of the existing HTTP/1.1 method name as defined in <ref> [7] </ref>. 5. If one or more mandatory extension declarations were present in the original request and the evaluation in 3) was successful then the server MUST reply by sending a 102 (Extended) followed by a HTTP/1.1 response containing the appropriate HTTP header fields .
Reference: [8] <author> E. Levinson, </author> <title> "Content-ID and Message-ID Uniform Resource Locators ", RFC 2111, </title> <month> March </month> <year> 1997 </year>
Reference-contexts: The only absolute requirement is that extension identifiers MUST be globally unique identifiers and that distinct names be used for distinct semantics. For example, one way to achieve this is to use a mid, cid <ref> [8] </ref>, or uuid [12] URI. Likewise, applications are not required to attempt resolving extension identifiers included in extension declarations.
