Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract The RIPE database specifications [2] and RPSL language [1] define languages used as the basis for representing information in a routing policy system. A repository for routing policy system information is known as a routing registry. A routing registry provides a means of exchanging information needed to address many issues on importance to the operation of the Internet. The implementation and deployment of a routing policy system must maintain some degree of integrity to be of any operational use. This document addresses the need to assure integrity of the data by providing an authentication and authorization model.

Reference-contexts: Failing to do so places no assurance of integrity of global routing information and leaves an opportunity for a very effective form of denial of service attack. The Routing Policy System Language (RPSL) <ref> [1, 13] </ref> was a fairly substantial evolutionary step in the data representation which was largely targeted at addressing the second group of needs. <p> However, even when no authentication mechanism is used, all involved parties can be notified about the changes that occurred through use of the existing "notify" attribute. 4 Organization of this Document Familiarity with RIPE-181 [2] and RPSL <ref> [1] </ref> is assumed throughout this document. Goals are described in Section 5. Section 6 through Section 8 provide descriptions of the changes and discussion. Section 9 provides a concise summary of data formats and semantics. Appendix A through Appendix C provide additional technical discussion, examples, and deployment considerations. <p> Whether authorization allows the recovery of address space must be selectable on a per object basis and may differ in parts of the database. This issue is discussed further in Appendix A. 6 Data Representation RPSL provides a complete description of the contents of a routing repository <ref> [1] </ref>. Many RPSL data objects remain unchanged from the RIPE and RPSL references the RIPE-181 specification as recorded in RFC-1786 [2]. RPSL provides external data representation. Data may be stored differently internal to a routing registry. <p> A deletion is considered a special case of the modify operation. The deleted object may remain in the database with a "deleted" attribute in which case the mnt-by can still be consulted to remove the "deleted" attribute. 9 Data Format Summaries RIPE-181 [2] and RPSL <ref> [1] </ref> data is represented externally as ASCII text. Objects consist of a set of attributes. Attributes are name value pairs. A single attribute is represented as a single line with the name followed by a colon followed by whitespace characters (space, tab, or line continuation) and followed by the value.

Reference-contexts: Renumbering is viewed as a practical means to maintain a strict numeric hierarchy [19]. It is also acknowledged that renumbering IPv4 networks can be difficult <ref> [19, 3, 20] </ref>. We examine first the simple case where hierarchy still exists. We then examine the operational cases where either initial topology is not tree structured or cases where topology changes. B.1 simple hierarchical address allocation and route allocation This is the simplest case.

Reference-contexts: The RIPE database formats as described in [2] were the basis of the original IRR. Routing protocols themselves provide no assurance that the origination of a route is legitimate and can actually reach the stated destination. The nature of CIDR allows more specific prefixes to override less specific prefixes <ref> [9, 18, 8] </ref>. Even with signed route origination, there is no way to determine if a more specific prefix is legitimate and should override a less specific route announcement without a means of determining who is authorized to announce specific prefixes. <p> The dial account need not be with the same provider used by the major institution. The potential for error is increased by the CIDR preference for more specific routes <ref> [8] </ref>. If an institution advertises a single route of a given length and a distant router advertises a more specific router covering critical hosts, the more specific route, if accepted at all, is preferred regardless of administrative weighting or any routing protocol attributes.

Reference-contexts: These registries in turn assign smaller ranges for direct use or to topologically large entities where allocations according to topology can reduce the amount of routing information needed (promote better route aggregation). AS objects are allocated as topology dictates the need for additional AS <ref> [10] </ref>. Route objects can be registered by those with authorization given by the AS and by the address owner. This is never an issue where the maintainer of the AS and the inetnum are the same.

Reference-contexts: Villamizar, et. al. Expires August 23, 1999 [Page 5] INTERNET-DRAFT Routing Policy System Security February 23, 1999 Address allocation and name allocation is already delegated. Since delegation can be to outside registries it is at least somewhat distributed <ref> [11] </ref>. Autonomous System (AS) numbers are allocated by the same authorities. It makes sense to delegate the routing number space in a manner similar to the address allocation and AS number allocation. <p> There is no standardization of address allocation policies though guidelines do exist <ref> [11, 19] </ref>. Whether authorization allows the recovery of address space must be selectable on a per object basis and may differ in parts of the database.

Reference-contexts: The Routing Policy System Language (RPSL) [1, 13] was a fairly substantial evolutionary step in the data representation which was largely targeted at addressing the second group of needs. The PRDB accommodated CIDR in 1993 <ref> [12] </ref> and the RIPE database accommodated the entry of CIDR prefixes from inception, but RPSL provides many needed improvements including explicit support for aggregation. This document addresses the third group of needs identified above.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, more active security mechanism need to be developed to prevent such problems before they happen. A separate document addresses the fourth group of needs <ref> [14] </ref>. 3 Implicit Policy Assumptions The authorization model encodes certain policies for allocation of address numbers, AS numbers, and for the announcement of routes. Implicit to the authorization model are a very limited number of policy assumptions. 1. Address numbers are allocated hierarchically. <p> The encapsulation of registry transaction submissions, registry queries and registry responses and exchanges between registries is outside the scope of this document. The encapsulation of registry transaction submissions and exchanges between registries is covered in <ref> [14] </ref>. 7 Authentication Model The maintainer objects serve as a container to hold authentication filters. A reference to a maintainer within another object defines authorization to perform operations on the object or on a set of related objects. The maintainer is typically referenced by name in mnt-by attributes of objects. <p> This is needed for authorization and it is needed to avoid having to make an exhaustive search of all repositories to find a specific AS. This search would not be a problem now but would be if a more distributed routing repository is used <ref> [14] </ref>. The "as-block" object also makes it possible to separate AS number allocation from registration of AS routing policy. as-block: AS1321 - AS1335 ... The "aut-num" describes the routing policy for an AS and is critical for router configuration of that AS and for analysis performed by another AS. <p> Expires August 23, 1999 [Page 12] INTERNET-DRAFT Routing Policy System Security February 23, 1999 from each repository that contains a less specific overlap. 8.9 Adding to the Database The root repository <ref> [14] </ref> must be initially populated at some epoch with a few entries. An initial maintainer is needed to add more maintainers. The referral-by attribute can be set to refer to itself in this special case (Section 9 describes the referral-by).
