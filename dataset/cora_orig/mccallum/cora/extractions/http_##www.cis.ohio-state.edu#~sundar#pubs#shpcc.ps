Abstract: We propose a new algorithm called Cyclic Exchange for all-to-all personalized exchange in a 2D mesh. This algorithm fully interleaves communication in both dimensions of a mesh. We have compared by simulation the performance of this algorithm with that of the Quadrant Exchange method previously proposed in the literature [2]. The results show that the new algorithm is faster for a range of machine size, problem size and startup/transmission ratio.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5, we present the results of the simulation study comparing Cyclic Exchange with Quadrant Exchange. Finally, Section 6 concludes by pointing out potential directions for further research. 2 Performance evaluation and system details It has been shown by studies <ref> [1] </ref> that edge contention is an important factor that degrades latency of communication in meshes. So past attempts at designing complete exchange algorithms have focussed on eliminating edge contention by scheduling a set of processors to exchange data among each other while other processors idle.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents a new algorithm to achieve this exchange for a wormhole-routed 2D mesh. The Complete Exchange has been investigated for 2D meshes by Scott [5] and Bokhari and Berryman <ref> [2] </ref> under the assumption that communications between processors occur in lockstep. This assumption allows one to conceive the exchange as happening in steps in which one or more processors send and receive data simultaneously. <p> It uses combining similar to Quadrant Exchange but unlike Direct Exchange. It uses fewer startups than Quadrant Exchange, which, in turn, is known to employ fewer startups than Direct Exchange. The algorithm performs significantly better than Quadrant Exchange <ref> [2] </ref> for a range of machine size, problem size and startup ratio, as shown by a performance study using a MIMD simulator. A fully interleaved algorithm called Interleaved Binary Exchange for complete exchange on a 2D mesh has been concurrently and independently developed by Gupta et al. [3]. <p> spent per word in reordering blocks. *: time to move a word from one section of memory to another. m: number of bytes in each block. p: there are 2 p processors on each side of the mesh. 3 Quadrant exchange algorithm Quadrant Exchange is a divide-and-conquer algorithm outlined in <ref> [2] </ref>. It organizes communications in a sequence of phases such that data blocks from each processor reach the same 2 i fi 2 i submesh as their destination node after phase i (i = p 1; : : : ; 0). <p> It organizes communications in a sequence of phases such that data blocks from each processor reach the same 2 i fi 2 i submesh as their destination node after phase i (i = p 1; : : : ; 0). In each phase, there are a series of steps <ref> [2, Figure 5,pp.304] </ref>, each of which have sets of 4 processors exchanging data directly among themselves. The completion time under the lockstep model is derived below.

Reference-contexts: times of different processors get overlapped, the total startup time during the algorithm execution would be 2pt s , which is two-thirds that for Quadrant Exchange. 5 Results of the simulation study The performances of Cyclic Exchange and Quadrant Exchange algorithms were studied using an event-driven simulator written in CSIM <ref> [4] </ref> which simulated the message transmission on the mesh at flit level. Following simulation parameters were used: t p : 0.10 microsecond. T node :0.02 microsecond. T inj ; T cons :0.10 microsecond. ; *: 0.05 microsecond.
