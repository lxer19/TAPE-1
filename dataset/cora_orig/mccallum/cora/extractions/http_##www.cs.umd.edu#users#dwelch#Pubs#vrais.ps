Reference-contexts: The type of message (light-weight object, network pointer, heavy-weight or real-time stream) as well as the recipients of the message (multi-casting) must be accessible to the programmer as a simple abstraction. <ref> [BMZ95] </ref> [MZP + 95] If VEs are only to receive pertinent messages, the run-time environment must have the logic to decide which entities get which messages.

Reference-contexts: The event interaction between the modules is described in the IL. The software engineer then uses the event mapping tool to create coercion modules that combined with the software bus and VE code make up the execution environment. <ref> [CP95] </ref> For example, the change location event in the Apache simulation will map to the BIFV update display event.

Reference-contexts: There has been little research on how to retrofit legacy systems into distributed VEs.<ref> [DPCS96] </ref> REQUIREMENTS FOR VE INTEGRATION In this section we lay out the functional requirements for SEVE. The non-functional requirements have been discussed elsewhere [DPCS96] and are beyond the scope of this paper. We use a running example to illustrate the requirements for a SEVE environment.

Reference-contexts: Most of the research on building distributed multi-user VEs concentrates on designing the distributed VEs from scratch. The EM toolkit and DIVE environment are two of the best known systems. They provide an environment for building the entire VE to include interconnection.[WGS95] <ref> [Gre94] </ref> Virtual Design is another complete VE software engineering environment that also focuses on using a wide array of input data and hardware.[AFM93] DoD's Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) defines a standard for how VEs interact, but not how to meet that standard.
