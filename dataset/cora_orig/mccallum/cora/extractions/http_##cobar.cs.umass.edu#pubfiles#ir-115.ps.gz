Abstract: The retrieval of OCR degraded text using n-gram formulations within a probabilistic retrieval system is examined in this paper. Direct retrieval of documents using n-gram databases of 2 and 3-grams or 2, 3, 4 and 5-grams resulted in improved retrieval performance over standard (word based) queries on the same data when a level of 10 percent degradation or worse was achieved. A second method of using n-grams to identify appropriate matching and near matching terms for query expansion which also performed better than using standard queries is also described. This method was less effective than direct n-gram query formulations but can likely be improved with alternative query component weighting schemes and measures of term similarity. Finally, a web based retrieval application using n-gram retrieval of OCR text and display, with query term highlighting, of the source document image is described.

Reference-contexts: We have incorporated this research in retrieval and highlighting of image query text using an Intelligent Document Understanding System (IDUS) developed at Lockheed-Martin Corporation [8] and INQUERY, a full text probabilistic retrieval system developed at the University of Massachusetts [9], <ref> [1] </ref>. The system allows retrieval of text images based on automatic OCR and logical text analysis of image content [11]. In this paper, we describe our efforts in using n-grams in query formulations and expansions with the goal of obtaining enhanced retrieval performance on OCR data. <p> Thus the word "Mexican" would be indexed to an INQUERY database as shown in Table 1. The n-grams are then combined to capture word representation using various INQUERY proximity operators <ref> [1] </ref>. The key indexing requirement for effective use of these structure operators is forcing all n-grams contained within a word token to have the same document word position as its encompassing word.

Reference-contexts: Although OCR errors have little effect on retrieval with good quality input, effectiveness can be significantly reduced in short texts with poor image or scanning quality <ref> [7, 4] </ref>. In an effort to reduce these losses, we have incorporated the use of n-grams for the representation of document words and user query terms using a probabilistic retrieval system with no modification to the evaluation process. <p> Precise error rates for the databases is unknown and is measured only by how much worse (percentage) standard query sets performed on the degraded database versus the non-degraded data. Test collections with small individual document sizes are more easily degraded than collections with larger sized documents <ref> [4] </ref> since large documents are more likely to have other words representing the search concept that have not been corrupted. The larger document length collections had to be degraded over several iterations before performance differences were measurable. Test collection characteristics are summarized in Table 3.

Reference-contexts: These experiments were performed using four different databases that were randomly degraded using data developed by the University of Nevada at Los Vegas (UNLV) <ref> [6] </ref>. Higher word error rates were used to further degrade the database when more severe corruption was to be tested. Words were corrupted using character recognition confusions typical of OCR systems, including the inclusion or deletion of spaces in words.
