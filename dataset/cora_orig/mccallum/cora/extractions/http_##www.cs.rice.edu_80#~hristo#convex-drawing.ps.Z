Abstract: Let G be a planar graph and H be a subgraph of G. Given any convex drawing of H, we investigate the problem of how to extend the drawing of H to a convex drawing of G. We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence and a linear algorithm for the construction of such an extension. Our results and their corollaries generalize previous theoretical and algorithmic results of Tutte, Thomassen, Chiba, Yamanouchi, and Nishizeki.

Reference-contexts: The reader is referred to [1] for annotated bibliography on graph drawings. The first linear-time algorithm for testing a graph for planarity was constructed by Hopcroft and Tarjan [9]. A different linear time algorithm was developed by Booth and Lueker <ref> [3] </ref>, who made use of P Q-trees and a previous algorithm of Lempel et al. [11]. Using the information obtained during the planarity testing, one can find in linear time a planar representation of the graph, if it is planar. Such an algorithm based on [3] has been described by Chiba <p> developed by Booth and Lueker <ref> [3] </ref>, who made use of P Q-trees and a previous algorithm of Lempel et al. [11]. Using the information obtained during the planarity testing, one can find in linear time a planar representation of the graph, if it is planar. Such an algorithm based on [3] has been described by Chiba et al. [4]. A classical result established by Wagner states that every planar graph has a planar straight-line drawing [18]. <p> This ordering of the edges corresponds to the order in which the edges are embedded around each vertex clockwise. The planarity testing algorithms from [9] and <ref> [3] </ref> produce only combinatorial embeddings. To each combinatorial embedding of G an infinite number of topological embeddings of G correspond. In the context of this paper we will call any topological embedding of G a drawing of G.

Reference-contexts: Based on the Thomassen's proof, ? This work is partially supported by National Scientific Foundation grant CCR-9409191. Fig. 1. A convex and a non-convex planar drawing. Chiba et al. <ref> [5] </ref> give a linear-time algorithm to construct such an extension if one exists. The choice of the outer face can, however, be crucial for the existence of a planar drawing. <p> For example, the graph on Figure 1 has a convex drawing in the plane if the face 1-2-3-4-5-1 is chosen to be the outer face, but has no convex drawing with outer face 1-2-3-4-1. Chiba et al. <ref> [5] </ref> reduce the problem of finding a suitable outer face (if one exists) to a planarity testing of a graph defined by the set of separation pairs of G. This paper contains some new theoretical and algorithmic results associated with the problem of drawing a planar graph convexly. <p> Call recursively EXTEND (G; H + p 0 ; (H + p 0 )). The correctness of this algorithm follows from the proof of Theorem 1. The algorithm can be easily implemented in linear time and space as in <ref> [5, 12] </ref>. ut If we can determine a cycle c of G that can be an outer facial cycle of a convex drawing of G, then we can draw c as a strictly convex polygon and then use Algorithm EXTEND described above to extend the drawing of c to a convex <p> However, a planar graph G can have an exponential number of cycles that can be faces of some drawing of G and we have no obvious way of finding an extendible one. Chiba et al. <ref> [5] </ref> construct a linear algorithm that finds an extendible outer facial cycle of G by applying the algorithms for finding the triconnected components of G [8] and for planarity testing [9] on a graph that contains structural information about G provided by the triconnectivity algorithm.
