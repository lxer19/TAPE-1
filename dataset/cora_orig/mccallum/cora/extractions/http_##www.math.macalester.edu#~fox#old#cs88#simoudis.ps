Abstract: We combine simple retrieval with domain-specific validation of retrieved cases to produce a useful practical tool for case-based reasoning. Based on 200 real-world cases, we retrieve between three and six cases over a wide range of new problems. This represents a selectivity ranging from 1.5% to 3%, compared to an average selectivity of only 11% from simple retrieval alone.

Reference-contexts: Existing systems ([1], <ref> [2] </ref>, [3], [4], [9] and [10]) make two assumptions about the initial retrieval of cases from the case base: 1. Very few cases will be retrieved from the case library. 2. The retrieved cases are relevant to the problem being solved. <p> As a result, our systems devote attention to minimizing the number of tests that are performed. We not only perform tests incrementally and cache the results, but also employ knowledge about the tests themselves to reduce the number of tests performed. The CBR system chef <ref> [2] </ref>, whose domain is Chinese cooking, also has a justification component. In order to justify each retrieved case, chef uses backward chaining rules. While our validation model is not appropriate to this domain, we have examined and rejected the use of rules for our validation models.

Reference-contexts: These models are captured by a semantic network that represents groups of tests and information about the relationships between the groups. Furthermore, as with casey, chef does not use the results of comparisons with earlier cases to prune its search for relevant cases. The swale <ref> [6] </ref> system concentrates primarily on modifying the explanation (contained in an explanation packet or XP) of a retrieved case to match a new problem. Nonetheless, it has a subcomponent, xp accepter, that justifies the application of a retrieved XP to a current situation.

Reference-contexts: Since the case base is large, and we have been interested primarily in sequential implementations, it is important that the case base be organized in a way that permits efficient search based on surface similarities. For this reason, we organize the cases into a generalization hierarchy (using unimem <ref> [7] </ref>). The retrieval phase consists of traversing the generalization hierarchy to find a close match to the new problem.

Reference-contexts: Validated retrieval relies on domain-specific knowledge about tests used to compare cases retrieved from the case base with newly presented problem cases. Knowledge about the relationships among the various tests is captured in a validation model which we implement as a se 2 2 RETRIEVAL IN CBR mantic network <ref> [8] </ref>. In order to build our validation model we are faced with a classic knowledge acquisition task.
