Abstract: In a previous paper [Berger et al., PNAS 91 7732, 1994], a theory of virus shell formation was proposed in which shell assembly is directed by local interactions of the coat and scaffolding subunits. This theory requires that the same chemical subunits assume different, stable conformations depending on their position in the shell. During assembly, the conformation of a protein subunit dictates the conformations of its neighboring subunits. It was shown that these local interactions could be designed so as to generate shells that have the same geometric structure as virus capsids. Different sets of local interactions, or local rules, were designed to produce different final shell geometries. In this paper, local rules are given that assemble a T = 7 shell such that a small change in these rules produces a T = 4 shell. This is intriguing since evidence has been accumulating that some T = 7 shells are closely related to T = 4 shells. These local rules also predict that hexamers in the assembled procapsid would have approximate two-fold rotational symmetry. This symmetry is exemplified by the elongation of hexamers observed in many T = 7 viruses. These rules also provide a possible explanation for spiraling and tubular malformations.

Reference-contexts: When the bacteria is coinfected with P4, P4 capsids are also formed which have T = 4 icosahedral structure but also use the P2 coat protein gpN. The P4 protein that influences size was determined to be gpSid <ref> [28, 1] </ref>. Since gpSid is present in immature P4 particles, but not in the mature virus, it is believed to act as a scaffolding protein [2, 12]. Similarly, a P2 protein gpO is believed to act as a scaffolding protein [18, 8, 6].

Reference-contexts: as a set of local rules for T = 4: By consistently choosing the disallowed configuration in Figure 3 (which is what prevents this set of rules from forming T = 4 shells), the set of rules is restricted to those for a T = 4 shell with four conformations <ref> [4] </ref> (i.e., Figures 1 (a), 1 (b), 1 (e), and 1 (f )). In the set of T = 7 rules, the hexamers are symmetric under rotations of 180 ffi . This symmetry is used in reducing the number of conformations in the rules from seven to four.

Reference-contexts: In icosahedral viruses this has been particularly difficult to explain because very often the same coat protein occurs in non-symmetric positions [26]. In Berger et al. <ref> [5] </ref>, a hypothesis for icosahedral viral shell assembly mechanisms was introduced. This hypothesis, the local rule theory of virus shell assembly, proposes that the assembly of virus shells is directed by the local interactions of its coat and scaffolding protein subunits. <p> For every T number, it is possible to find a set of local rules producing that T number and using a number of protein conformations that is equal to the T number <ref> [5] </ref>. It is sometimes also possible to find a different set of local rules resulting in the same shell geometry with fewer conformations by using rules that assign the same conformation to non-equivalent positions. <p> The local rules provide a possible explanation for the standard spiral structure <ref> [5] </ref>; in particular, if a hexamer occurs at a 5-fold axis of symmetry, spiraling occurs in computer simulations (Figure 6). <p> Consistently choosing the disallowed configuration will restrict the rules chosen to precisely those rules for a T = 7 capsid with seven conformations (i.e., Figures 7 (a), 7 (b), 7 (d), 7 (f), 7 (h), 7 (i), and 7 (k)) <ref> [5] </ref>. It would be interesting to know whether there is any biological evidence for the relation between T = 13 and T = 7 shells.

That scaffolding proteins are indeed associated with the pentamers in P22 is indicated by evidence that scaffolding is involved in initiation of shells in vitro [25] and in vivo [3].

Reference-contexts: Similarly, these rules give constraints on the placement of the scaffolding molecules in these viruses. The local rules given here also account for the elongation of hexamers observed in phage P22 procapsids [22]. 2 Theory 2.1 Basic model and assumptions The theory of quasi-equivalence <ref> [9] </ref> observed that the same protein subunits are not quite equivalent due to differences in the global symmetry, but still it was assumed they really have almost equivalent conformations and nearly identical chemical properties. Since then, evidence has been accumulating that the subunit conformations can be much more flexible [13].

Reference-contexts: Since then, evidence has been accumulating that the subunit conformations can be much more flexible <ref> [13] </ref>. A local rule theory postulates that the coat and scaffolding proteins can assume a number of distinct conformations, and thus it is not bound by the notion that these proteins have identical properties. <p> However, this is quite reasonable for real viral coat proteins (at least for P22) since by Galisteo et al.'s results <ref> [13] </ref>, these proteins are quite flexible in solution. The local rule theory is described in terms of conformationally flexible monomers binding to a growing shell. Whereas certain bacteriophages such as P22 and are known to form from monomers, the theory need not be so restrictive.

Reference-contexts: This may also be the reason for the substantial changes that other bacteriophages undergo between their precursor and mature forms <ref> [15] </ref>. Whereas in P4 and P2, scaffolding proteins appear responsible for the switch between T = 4 or T = 7 shells, in , several mutations of the coat protein produce T = 4 shells [16].

Reference-contexts: Another indication that T = 4 and T = 7 shells are related is that in bacteriophage , which also has a T = 7 capsid, mutations of the coat protein exist that form functional T = 4 shells <ref> [16] </ref>. A third indication of this relationship is that one of the common mistakes observed in the assembly of the phage P22 in the absence of scaffolding proteins is the formation of a T = 4 shell instead of a T = 7 structure [10]. <p> Whereas in P4 and P2, scaffolding proteins appear responsible for the switch between T = 4 or T = 7 shells, in , several mutations of the coat protein produce T = 4 shells <ref> [16] </ref>. This may indicate that the role of scaffolding in the local rules differs in these viruses. Whereas in P22 and P2 the choice of hexamer as in Figure 3 is enforced by the scaffolding, in it may be enforced through interactions between coat proteins.

If these icosahedral capsids indeed form by following a set of local rules, then this set of local rules should have the property that a relatively small perturbation of the rules directing a T = 7 shell should produce a T = 4 shell.

Reference-contexts: We thus believe that it is likely that the gpO and gpSid particles in P2 and P4 form a connected inner scaffold. After the above paragraph was written, we learned that Lindqvist et al. had found that the gpSid molecules in P4 form a connected outer scaffold <ref> [20] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For some time, evidence has been accumulating that T = 7 and T = 4 shells are in some cases closely related. The most recent indications that this is true arise in experiments with bacteriophage P2 and its satellite phage P4 <ref> [21] </ref>. The capsid of bacteriophage P2 is a T = 7 icosahedral structure formed from a phage protein gpN. When the bacteria is coinfected with P4, P4 capsids are also formed which have T = 4 icosahedral structure but also use the P2 coat protein gpN. <p> Since gpSid is present in immature P4 particles, but not in the mature virus, it is believed to act as a scaffolding protein [2, 12]. Similarly, a P2 protein gpO is believed to act as a scaffolding protein [18, 8, 6]. Marvik et al. <ref> [21] </ref> showed that the capsid size is indeed determined by these auxiliary proteins gpO and gpSid. <p> In fact, the structures resulting from assembly of pure P22 coat protein are quite similar to those resulting from pure P2 coat protein <ref> [10, 22, 21] </ref>, possibly indicating that these 2 two viruses have similar assembly mechanisms, even though the sequences of these two proteins do not appear very similar [19]. <p> It would be interesting to know whether there is any biological evidence for the relation between T = 13 and T = 7 shells. Similar relationships between other pairs of T-numbers would also be interesting. 3 Discussion Experimentally <ref> [21] </ref>, the P2 coat protein assembles into fewer malformations in the presence of both scaffolding proteins than it does in the presence of either alone. This seems counter-intuitive, 8 because it might be the case that these scaffolding molecules interfere with each other by both bonding to the same shell.

The local rules given here also account for the elongation of hexamers observed in phage P22 procapsids <ref> [22] </ref>. 2 Theory 2.1 Basic model and assumptions The theory of quasi-equivalence [9] observed that the same protein subunits are not quite equivalent due to differences in the global symmetry, but still it was assumed they really have almost equivalent conformations and nearly identical chemical properties. <p> There could also be fewer, since the distinctness of conformations during assembly need not be maintained in the final shell. In phage P22, for example, the conformations of coat proteins in the final capsid appear more similar then the conformations in the procapsid <ref> [22] </ref>. One of these four conformations will be considered first. Figure 1 (a) gives the rule for how one of the four conformations, the type 1 conformation, chemically binds in three dimensions. <p> These rules also make use of 2-fold symmetry in the hexamers to direct assembly. The requirement in the rules for two-fold rotational symmetry of hexamers is intriguing because the micrographs of P22 show near-symmetry of the hexamers under 180 ffi rotations <ref> [22] </ref>. This is seen in the elongation of the hexamers of P22 precursor virus along the axis connecting the two type 3 conformations. Our estimates for numbers of scaffolding proteins are consistent with experimental data. <p> These results show that at low concentrations, scaffolding proteins are monomers in solution, and with increasing concentration they first form dimers and then tetramers. For P22, the differences between the protein conformations in non-equivalent positions are noticeably less in the mature form than in the precursor form <ref> [22] </ref>. Perhaps functionally different protein conformations are required for assembly, while in the mature form all the proteins assume the same functionality and need only be different enough to hold the shell together stably.

Reference-contexts: These 120 sites with tightly bound scaffolding protein would likely be the important sites for control of virus assembly. Further evidence for 120 important sites for virus assembly comes from work of Prevelige et al. <ref> [23] </ref>, which shows that the minimum number of scaffolding molecules required for assembly approaches the value of 130 or so, in good agreement with 120 tightly-bound sites which are necessary for control of assembly.

Reference-contexts: Recall that we needed the initiation complex to be a pentamer. This assumption seems realistic since for several bacteriophages, an initiation complex located at one of the pentamers is required to guarantee formation of the desired structure in vivo [29]. Further evidence in support of this assumption appears in <ref> [25] </ref>, which gives evidence that in vitro initiation of P22 capsids occurs at a pentamer. Conformational flexibility is required for the sets of rules given here, since proteins do not assume their final conformation until after having first bound and also waited for a neighboring protein to attach. <p> That scaffolding proteins are indeed associated with the pentamers in P22 is indicated by evidence that scaffolding is involved in initiation of shells in vitro <ref> [25] </ref> and in vivo [3].

Reference-contexts: At first glance, the assembly of the shells seems easy to understand, because the structure is so regular. In fact, it has been difficult to determine the actual pathway through which the subunits interact to form a closed shell composed of hundreds of subunits <ref> [26] </ref>. In icosahedral viruses this has been particularly difficult to explain because very often the same coat protein occurs in non-symmetric positions [26]. In Berger et al. [5], a hypothesis for icosahedral viral shell assembly mechanisms was introduced. <p> In fact, it has been difficult to determine the actual pathway through which the subunits interact to form a closed shell composed of hundreds of subunits <ref> [26] </ref>.

This assumption seems realistic since for several bacteriophages, an initiation complex located at one of the pentamers is required to guarantee formation of the desired structure in vivo <ref> [29] </ref>. Further evidence in support of this assumption appears in [25], which gives evidence that in vitro initiation of P22 capsids occurs at a pentamer.
