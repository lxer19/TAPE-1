Abstract: This paper discusses a generalization of the function transformation scheme for global energy minimization applied to the molecular conformation problem. A mathematical theory for the method as a special continuation approach to global optimization is established. We show that the method can transform a nonlinear objective function into a class of gradually deformed, but "smoother" or "easier" functions. An optimization procedure can then be applied to the new functions successively, to trace their solutions back to the original function. Two types of transformation are defined: isotropic and anisotropic. We show that both transformations can be applied to a large class of nonlinear partially separable functions including energy functions for molecular conformation. Methods to compute the transformation for these functions are given.

Reference-contexts: The third method provides a more accurate and reliable way to trace the solution curves. As we have shown in this paper, the curves are solutions to well defined initial value problems. So standard numerical IVP-methods can be used (e.g., predictor-corrector methods) <ref> [1] </ref>. The implementation of all three tracing procedures and the numerical comparison among them will be of great interest for the further development of the algorithms. We are especially interested in applying these methods to the global energy minimization problems for molecular conformation, especially protein folding.

Reference-contexts: used pairwise energy function is the Van der Waals energy function, h ij (kr ij k) = * ij ( kr ij k oe ij ) 6 + *kr ij k where * ij , oe ij , *, q i , and q j are all physical constants (see <ref> [2] </ref>). Problem (1) is very difficult to solve in general. The reasons are as fol lows: First, in theory even simple versions of the problem have been proved 2 to be N P-complete [9]. <p> Most popularly used energy functions for molecular conformation and protein folding can be expressed as pairwise forms, for example, the Lennard-Jones potential, the electrostatic potential, the interaction potential for bonded atoms, etc. <ref> [2, 16] </ref>. However, some energy functions do contain terms that are not pairwise distance functions; for instance, the torsional potential usually is given as a function of the dihedral angle.

Reference-contexts: In recent efforts smoothing techniques are specifically designed for molecular conformation via global minimization.

In this paper, we discuss an important generalization of the effective energy transformation scheme introduced in <ref> [4, 5, 17, 18] </ref>.

Second, in practice the objective function often con-tains exponentially many local minimizers; therefore, search for the global minimizer can be computationally intractable. Third, the protein molecules tend to be very large, typically containing O (10,000) atoms.
