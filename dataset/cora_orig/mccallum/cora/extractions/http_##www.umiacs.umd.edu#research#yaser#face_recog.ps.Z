Abstract: This paper describes work in progress that evaluates the performance of alternative approaches for face recognition when applied to static and dynamic imagery of people expressing emotion. The work is carried out on a database of 130 people that includes over 125,000 frames.

Reference-contexts: We chose to ignore gross head motions since these may be compensated by a face tracking module such as the one proposed by Black and Yacoob <ref> [BLA94] </ref>. To address these goals we created a large database of active face images.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Face recognition continues to be a challenging problem in computer vision despite the variety of approaches proposed in recent years [BRU93,MAN91,PEN94] (for a comprehensive review of the literature see <ref> [CHE94] </ref>). Most research has focused on static imagery, often assuming frontal view and a neutral facial expression. Some approaches are biased towards recognizing males over females, or particular race and skin color.

Reference-contexts: Our current research on face recognition is focused on the following goals: * To carry out extensive comparative empirical studies of both template based and feature-based approaches. The eigenface approach proposed in [TUR91] and the feature-graph based approach <ref> [MAN91] </ref> have been selected as representatives. These two approaches have been extensively tested although never under similar conditions.

Reference-contexts: The eigenface approach is a global operator. Generally, it is expected to be robust to local changes (a fact that can play against it if the similarity between the faces is high). The most extensive testing of this approach was reported by Pentland et. al <ref> [PEN94] </ref>. The database included 7562 images of about 3000 people. The reported performance was around 90% correct classification on people in the database. The feature-graph based approach proceeds in three stages. The first selects feature points using a Gabor wavelet transform that identifies points with high curvature changes. <p> This is an inherent difficulty with the eigenface approach. Overall, these results are consistent with the conjecture that the eigenface approach is only slightly sensitive to local variations from the database <ref> [PEN94] </ref>. 5 Results of feature-graph based approach The feature-graph approach consists of two levels of processing that make the approach more sensitive to facial expressions. The selection of the feature points can be altered by the expressions due to changing the topography of the surface of the intensity image.

Reference-contexts: If the experiments were run on static images of neutral faces, most of the scores would be well below 1000 on the scale shown. The results in Figure 1 show segmentation of the input sequence into parts where facial expressions occur (see <ref> [YAC94] </ref> for a psychological review and further information on an automatic approach for face expression recognition). These graphs show a consistent degradation in the distance results in the presence of facial expressions.
