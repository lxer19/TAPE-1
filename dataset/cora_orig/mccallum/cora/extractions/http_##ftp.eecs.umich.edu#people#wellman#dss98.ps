Abstract: We consider a general family of auction mechanisms that admit multiple buyers and sellers, and determine market-clearing prices. We analyze the economic incentives facing participants in such auctions, demonstrating that, under some conditions, it is possible to induce truthful revelation of values by buyers or sellers, but not both, and for single- but not multi-unit bids. We also perform a computational analysis of the auctioneer's task, exhibiting efficient algorithms for processing bids and calculating allocations.

Reference-contexts: Notice that this definition generalizes the common notion of bid-ask spread, since it applies even if the buy and sell bids overlap. In fact, the M th- and (M + 1)st-price rules belong to a more general class of mechanisms called k-double auctions [17]. The parameter k 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> specifies the fraction between the (M + 1)st and M th prices at which the clearing price is set. The algorithm we present in Section 5 applies to the entire class of k-double auctions. <p> Rothkopf et al. [16] study restrictions in allowable multicommodity bundles that enable tractable solution of the auction's optimization problem. Even when each auction faces a tractable problem, we might obtain significant computational savings by careful management of the communication and clearing operations. Andersson and Ygge <ref> [1] </ref> apply hierarchical market structures for distributing the calculation of market-clearing prices and allocations. Their CoTree algorithm allows designers to make tradeoffs between the number of messages, and the dimensionality of local excess demand calculations.

Reference-contexts: The size of this heap is O (M ). Recall that a heap data structure is a complete binary tree, with the property that each node has a priority not exceeding its parent's <ref> [3] </ref>. Inserting a new node into the heap (put), or removing the top node (get) each take O (lg K) time, where K is the size of the heap. The 4-Heap algorithm ensures several constraints among the heaps.

Reference-contexts: Potential buyers and sellers must first find one another, then negotiate the terms 1 of the exchange, and finally, execute the transaction. Electronic commerce promises to automate part, or all, of each of these steps. Resource finding is facilitated by search engines and shopping agents <ref> [4] </ref>, and electronic payment mechanisms [9] execute part of the exchange. Infrastructure for automated negotiation has not received as much attention, although the proliferation of online auctions on the World-Wide Web 1 is evidence that explicit price formation mechanisms will play an important role in electronic commerce.

The GVA calculates an efficient allocation of the goods, and net payments for each agent. <p> Assume that marginal utility is nonincreasing with j. Let r i be the bid reported by agent i, and p (r 1 ; r 2 ) the price determined by the auction as a function of the bids. By the revelation principle <ref> [6] </ref>, we can restrict our attention to a mechanism in which the buyers report their marginal valuations for each unit of the good.

Reference-contexts: We also perform a computational analysis of the auctioneer's task, exhibiting efficient algorithms for processing bids and calculating allocations. 2 Auction Design Most of the classic auctions examined in introductory surveys of auction theory <ref> [10, 14] </ref> are one-sided, in that a single seller (or buyer) accepts bids from multiple buyers (or sellers). Two-sided, or double auctions [5], in contrast, permit multiple buyers and sellers to bid to exchange a designated commodity. <p> The highest, or first, price expressly offered is used by the classic English, Dutch, and first-price sealed-bid auctions <ref> [10, 14] </ref>. <p> In the following theoretical analysis, we assume that agents have independent private values for the goods, which means that each agent knows its own valuation, which is unaffected by the value other agents place on the good <ref> [10] </ref>. An auction is incentive compatible if the agents optimize their expected utilities by bidding their true valuations for the good. This is a desirable feature because an agent's decision depends only on its local information, and it gains no advantage by expending effort to model other agents.

Reference-contexts: Two-sided, or double auctions [5], in contrast, permit multiple buyers and sellers to bid to exchange a designated commodity. The continuous double auction (CDA), matches buyers and sellers immediately on detection of compatible bids. A periodic version of the double auction (sometimes termed a call market <ref> [11] </ref> or clearinghouse) instead collects bids over a specified interval of time, then clears the market at the expiration of the bidding interval. 2 Most types of auctions can be characterized in terms of how they manage three core activities: 1. Process Bid. <p> The second-price rule was proposed and analyzed by Vickrey in his seminal work establishing the field of auction theory [19]. 3 When M &gt; 1, the M th-and (M + 1)st-price auctions correspond to the multi-unit generalizations of Dutch and English auctions studied by McCabe et al. <ref> [11] </ref>. 4 Incentive Compatibility Analysis The M th- and (M + 1)st-price rules are symmetric with respect to their treatment of buyers and sellers.

Reference-contexts: If the agents have uncertain correlated values, then, in any of the auctions considered here, an agent should generally bid below its estimated valuation in order to avoid the "winner's curse" <ref> [13] </ref>. An auction is individually rational if its allocations do not make any agent worse off than had the agent not participated. An allocation is efficient if there are no further gains from trade possible. This implies that the goods are allocated to the agents who value them most highly.

Reference-contexts: The only way to get incentive compatibility for both is if some party is willing to subsidize the auction. Myerson and Satterthwaite <ref> [15] </ref> show that there does not exist any bargaining mechanism that is individually rational, efficient, and Bayesian incentive compatible for both buyers and sellers, that does not require outside subsidies. We next consider another relaxation of the theorems' conditions, specifically the restriction to single-unit bids.

Reference-contexts: This is especially relevant to auctions covering multiple commodities, in which clearing prices are often determined by combinatorial optimization.

As noted above, for M = 1 the (M + 1)st-price auction is the well-studied second-price mechanism. Vickrey <ref> [19] </ref> showed that the sealed-bid version of this mechanism is incentive compatible for the buyers. The intuition behind 8 this result is as follows.

As a result, it is suboptimal for the buyer to place truthful multi-unit bids. We now show that this result generalizes to a broad class of uniform-price auctions.
