Abstract: Default model theory is a nonmonotonic formalism for representing and reasoning about commonsense knowledge. Although this theory is motivated by ideas in Reiter's work on default logic, it is a very different, in some sense dual framework. We make Reiter's default extension operator into a constructive method of building models, not theories. Domain theory, which is a well established tool for partial information in the semantics of programming languages, is adopted as the basis for constructing partial models. One of the direct advantages of default model theory is that nonmonotonic reasoning can be conducted with monotonic logics, by using the method of model checking, instead of theorem proving. This paper reconsiders some of the laws of nonmonotonic consequence, due to Gabbay and to Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, in the light of default model theory. We remark that in general, Gabbay's law of cautious monotony is open to question. We consider an axiomatization of the nonmonotonic consequence relation omitting this law. We prove a representation theorem showing that such relations are in one to one correspondence with the consequence relations determined by extensions in Scott domains augmented with default sets. This means that defaults are very expressive: they can, in a sense, represent any reasonable nonmonotonic entailment. Results about what kind of defaults determine cautious monotony are also discussed. In particular, we show that the property of unique extension guarantees cautious monotony, and we characterize default structures which determine unique extensions.

Since Gabbay <ref> [6] </ref>, a considerable amount of work has been done on axiomatizations of nonmonotonic consequence relations, here denoted by j. Before we get into the more technical details of our framework, we give an intuitive description of our interpretation of j. Let ' and be certain formulas, propositional or otherwise.

Reference-contexts: Our modal logic is decidable, with validity being co-NP-complete. What is it that makes it possible to do nonmonotonic reasoning using a monotonic logic? The fact that extensions in default model theory are partial models makes it possible to reason by model checking, as advocated by Halpern and Vardi <ref> [10] </ref>. Nonmonotonic reasoning can be reduced to, for example, checking if x j= B' holds, instead of whether or not ' follows from x by applying certain extended deduction rules for first order logic. <p> Computational cost. Default model theory is intuitively computationally less complex than the highly undecidable default logic. This is partly because model checking is generally easier than theorem proving <ref> [10] </ref>, and partly because situations are typically made of only atomic, propositional statements (considered as databases), not arbitrary first order formulas.

Reference-contexts: For us, minimizing information is done by minimizing models. Then we use default systems to recreate belief spaces from minimal information.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction: Default models versus theories The purpose of this paper is to explore just one of the directions suggested by making default systems, as in Reiter's work <ref> [19] </ref>, into constructions for building partial models for various kinds of logic. <p> In that construction, elementary `tokens' are added to a partial model according to a monotonic rule system. We augment Scott's monotonic rules with default rules to obtain a class of default information systems. For these systems, we construct extensions of a given world, as in Reiter's work <ref> [19] </ref>, but these extensions are models, not theories. We suggest that Reiter's default systems should be regarded as semantic, not syntactic notions. This is a radical reconstruction of default reasoning. We call our thesis, together with its supporting evidence, default model theory.

Therefore, we suggest the reader not to try to fit this paper into the realm of default logic.

One can imagine having two defaults X : ; ; :a which are fundamentally incoherent, with the `justification' parts unrelated to the applicability of the defaults. <p> However, it is important to point out that properties of derived nonmonotonic entailment not only depend on the kind of defaults used, but also depend on the procedure for building the extended partial world. Although extension is one of the key model building method, there are other possibilities. In <ref> [21] </ref>, we introduce a construction called a dilation, motivated from the need to ensure the existence of extended partial world for all reasonable defaults. Dilations are a robust generalization of extensions, and exist for all semi-normal default structures.

Reference-contexts: For this reason, our basic approach to default reasoning uses the theory of domains. We view Reiter's default rule systems as nondeterministic `algorithms' for populating a (partial) model with elementary facts about particular situations. This is in exact analogy with (in fact a generalization of) Scott's concrete characterization <ref> [23] </ref> of consistently complete !- algebraic partial orders (Scott domains) using the technique of information systems.
