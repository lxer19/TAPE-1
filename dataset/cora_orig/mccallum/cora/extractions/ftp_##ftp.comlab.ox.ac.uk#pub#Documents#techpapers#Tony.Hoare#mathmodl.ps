Title: Mathematical Models for  C.A.R. Hoare  
Date: August 1994  
Pubnum: Computing Science  
Abstract: Mathematical equations and other predicates are used in the physical sciences to formalise, describe, and predict the observable behaviour of some isolatable fragment of the real world. Phenomena of interest in computing science can with advantage be formalised as mathematical predicates in the same scientific way. As a result, concurrency can often be modelled by conjunction [5], non-determinism by disjunction, locality by existential quantification, and correctness by logical implication [7]. This thesis is illustrated by application at a variety of levels of granularity, scale and abstraction: in hardware, by switching, combinational and sequential circuitry [9, 6]; and in programming [4] by the procedural [2], parallel [1], and logical [8] paradigms. The major achievement of modern science is to demonstrate the links between phenomena at different levels of abstraction and generality, from quarks, particles, atoms and molecules right through to stars, galaxies, and (more conjecturally) the entire universe. On a less grand scale, the computer scientist has to establish such links in every implementation of higher level concepts in terms of lower [10, 11]. Such links are also formalised as equations or more general predicates, describing the relationships between observations made at different levels of abstraction [3]. Their clarification assists in understanding the structure of an entire scientific discipline.
