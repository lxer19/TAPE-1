Title: A Note on the Convexity of the Probability of a Full Buffer in the M=M=1=K
Author: Ramesh Nagarajan and Don Towsley 
Keyword: M=M=1=K QUEUE; CONVEXITY OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES; LOSS SYSTEM.  
Abstract: The loss probability in queueing systems is a very useful metric in the design and analysis of high-speed communication networks. In this paper, we investigate the convexity properties of this metric for the finite-buffer, single server M=M=1=K queue. We demonstrate that the loss probability in the M=M=1=K queue is convex with respect to the traffic intensity (arrival rate) for values of the traffic intensity below a certain value fl (K) and is concave for values of the traffic intensity larger than fl (K). We establish several useful properties of fl (K). Second, we show that the loss probability is convex with respect to the service rate. Last, we show that the throughput is jointly concave in the arrival and service rates while the loss rate is jointly convex with respect to the same.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Convexity properties of performance measures of queueing systems are useful in solving optimization problems in stochastic systems. The loss probability in queueing systems has acquired significance, recently, in the design and analysis of high-speed communication networks <ref> [12, 4, 1, 19] </ref>. Consequently, we are witnessing an increasing study of optimization problems involving loss performance measures in queueing networks [14, 17, 11]. <p> We demonstrated as to how fl (K) can be determined numerically and illustrated the computation for some sample buffer sizes. Further, we investigated properties of fl (K). Of most interest, we have shown that the loss probability in the M=M=1=K queue is convex for 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; K 4, which is a regime of considerable practical interest in communication system analysis. We also showed that for h (K) &gt; 1:0, where h (K) is presented in closed-form, the function is entirely concave.

Reference-contexts: We, now, restate a theorem from <ref> [2, Theorem. 94] </ref> which states an important property of convex functions: Theorem 1 Suppose that f (x) possesses a second derivative f 00 (x) in the open interval (x 1 ; x 2 ). <p> Then a necessary and sufficient condition that f (x) should be convex in the interval is f (x) 0. However, in certain cases we will be interested in proving convexity over a closed interval rather than the open interval. A footnote in <ref> [2, pp. 76] </ref> states that the above theorem extends to the closed interval, [x 1 ; x 2 ], provided the value of the function at the end-points is 2 not less than the limiting value of the function at that end.
