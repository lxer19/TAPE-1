Abstract: In this note we consider the fluid queue driven by an M=M=1 queue as analysed by Virtamo and Norros [5]. We show that the stationary buffer content in this model can be easily analysed by looking at embedded time points. This approach gives the stationary buffer content distribution in terms of the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order one. By using a suitable integral representation for this Bessel function we show that our results coincide with the ones of [5].

Reference-contexts: If we introduce the random variable T as the stationary buffer content at an arbitrary point in time, then standard renewal theory arguments show that (see also Kella and Whitt <ref> [3] </ref>) T = Z + ~ X; w:p: EX=(EX + EY ); (2) where all random variables involved are independent and ~ X (resp. ~ Y ) denotes the residual life time of the random variable X (resp. Y ).

Reference-contexts: So, f X () = F 0 X () is the density of the busy period in an M=M=1 queue with arrival intensity and service intensity , i.e. (see eq. (5.145) of <ref> [4] </ref>), f X (x) = x ae p where ae := = and I 1 () denotes the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order one. The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of this busy period is given by (see eq. (5.144) of [4]) + + s [( + + s) 2 <p> service intensity , i.e. (see eq. (5.145) of <ref> [4] </ref>), f X (x) = x ae p where ae := = and I 1 () denotes the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order one. The Laplace-Stieltjes transform of this busy period is given by (see eq. (5.144) of [4]) + + s [( + + s) 2 4] 1=2 :(4) Since the idle period in the M=M=1, and thus Y , is exponentially distributed with parameter , the transform T fl () satisfies eq. (3).
