Title: Abstract  
Abstract: We study an application of image registration in the medical domain. Based on a 3-D hierarchical deformable registration algorithm, we have developed a prototype system which automatically aligns a standard atlas to a subjects data to create a customized atlas. Combined with domain knowledge, the registration algorithm can also detect asymmetries and abnormal variations in the subjects data that indicate the existence and location of pathologies. We have conducted tests on 106 MRI scans of normal brains, 3 MRI and 1 CT scan of brains with pathologies, with results qualitatively comparable to manual segmentation.

Reference-contexts: Ba-jcsy et al. elastically deform a 3D atlas to match anatomical brain images. The method requires user interaction and is computationally expensive [6],[7]. Christensen et al. used a fluid dynamic deformable model <ref> [1] </ref>, [2]. It takes 1.8 hours and the same cross-section overlaid with deformation vectors (right). The magnitude and direction of the deformation vectors indicate the possible existence and location of the pathologies.
