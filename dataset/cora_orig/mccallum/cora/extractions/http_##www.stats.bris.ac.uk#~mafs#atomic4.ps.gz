Abstract: We consider random functions defined by atomic decompositions in a wavelet dictionary. The scale and dilation of the wavelet atoms are not dyadic constraints, but the function is modelled as a sum of wavelet functions at arbitrary positions and scales. The locations of the wavelet atoms and the magnitudes of their coefficients are chosen with respect to a certain marked Poisson process model, allowing intuitive notions about the functions genuinely to be modelled. We explore the properties of realizations from the proposed models by investigating the relationships between the parameters of the models and the Besov spaces within which realizations fall. Such relations may be seen as giving insight into the meaning of the Besov space parameters themselves. Moreover, although we do not elaborate on this, the established relations make it possible in principle to incorporate prior knowledge about the function's regularity into statistical applications of the proposed models.

Reference-contexts: This localization allows parsimonious representation for a wide range of different functions in wavelet series. We shall assume that the the scaling function and the mother wavelet have compact support and correspond to an r-regular multiresolution analysis, for some integer r &gt; 0 <ref> (e.g. Daubechies, 1992) </ref>. This will imply that and are members of the Holder space C r , and that has vanishing moments up to order r. For examples of mother wavelets with compact support, and with various regularity properties, see Daubechies (1992). <p> Anderson et al. (1993) and Cohen, Daubechies & Vial (1993), amongst others, obtained necessary boundary corrections to retain orthonormality. Another possibility is to confine attention to periodic functions on R with unit period and work in effect with periodic wavelets <ref> (e.g. Daubechies, 1992, Section 9.3) </ref>. The equivalences we set out below are valid whichever boundary correction is used, and as Johnstone (1994) points out, any boundary modifications affect only a fixed number of wavelet coefficients at each resolution level j.

Reference-contexts: The Besov space B s p;q on [0; 1] is the class of functions g : [0; 1] ! R for which g 2 L p [0; 1] and the seminorm jgj B s p;q <ref> (as defined, for example, in Donoho et al., 1995) </ref> is finite. <p> The latter functions are of statistical interest in providing particular models of spatial inhomogeneity <ref> (e.g. Donoho et al., 1995) </ref>. Choose now a collection of scaling functions f j 0 k g and wavelets f jk ; j j 0 g that correspond to an r-regular multiresolution analysis as noted in Section 2.1.

Reference-contexts: For any positive and c, Markov's inequality implies that P (jw jk j c) 2e c E (e w jk ): (29) To evaluate the expectation, we use the standard expression for the moment generating function of a normal distribution and Campbell's theorem <ref> (see, for example, Kingman, 1993, p. 28) </ref> applied to the random sum (21) to obtain log E (e w jk ) = log EfE (e w jk jS)g = log E expf 1 2 2 2 (S)g Z jk [expf 1 2 2 K (; jk ) 2 a ffi g <p> Then: EjY " j l = " c l + o (") as " ! 0: (33) Proof. Appealing to Campbell's Theorem <ref> (e.g. Kingman, 1993, p. 28) </ref>, condition (30) shows that the random variable defined by (31) is well defined with probability one, in the sense that the right hand side of (31) is absolutely convergent with probability one. <p> Then: EjY " j l = " u l + o (") as " ! 0: Proof. Define a measure on R by g (A) = (g 1 (A)) and let Z = g (X). Then, appealing to the Mapping theorem for Poisson processes <ref> (e.g. Kingman, 1993, p. 18) </ref>, Z is a Poisson process on R with intensity measure " g and Y " = P X2S " Z. The proof of the corollary is completed by applying Lemma 1 to Z and g .

Reference-contexts: This localization allows parsimonious wavelet expansions for a wide set of functions with various degrees and kinds of smoothness. However, being a basis, orthonormal wavelet dictionaries are essentially minimal wavelet dictionaries, and this causes poor adaptivity <ref> (Mallat & Zhang, 1993) </ref>. Overcomplete wavelet dictionaries are obtained by sampling indices more finely. This increases the adaptivity of the dictionary, because one can choose the most suitable representation among many available. An important example of over-complete wavelet dictionaries is the stationary wavelet dictionary (e.g.
