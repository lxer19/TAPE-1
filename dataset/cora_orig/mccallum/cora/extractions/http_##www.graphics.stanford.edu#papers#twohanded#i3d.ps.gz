Abstract: We have built a system that allows users to naturally manipulate virtual 3D models with both hands on the Responsive Workbench, a tabletop VR device. Our design is largely based upon Guiard's observations of how humans distribute work between the two hands in the real world. We show how to apply these principles for the workbench environment and describe many issues encountered during the design. We first develop a framework for two-handed interaction and then explore a variety of two-handed 3D tools and interactive techniques. Related issues include how constraints are implemented and controlled by the two hands and how transitions between one-handedand two-handed tasks occur seemlessly. Informal observations of the system in practice show that users can perform navigation and manipulation tasks easily and with little training using the two-handed environment. One of our interesting findings was that users often performed two-handed manipulations by combining two otherwise independent one-handed tools in a synergistic fashion. In these cases, we did not program two-handed behaviors explicitly into the system; instead they emerged naturally.

Reference-contexts: We implemented both bimanual symmetric and bimanual asymmetric tools for the Workbench. Coordinated Symmetric Interaction We present five different types of two-handed symmetric tools: symmetric scale, slide-and-turn, turntable, grab-and-carry, and grab-and-twirl. The scaling tool shrinks or enlarges objects by moving both hands together or apart, similar to <ref> [3, 12, 14] </ref>. The slide-and-turn (Figure 5) allows the user to perform a steering-wheel motion on the table top. This tool exploits the fact supports multiple toolboxes which group similar tasks together. The tools are displayed as 3D icons that visually represent their functionality.

Reference-contexts: This paper describes two-handed interaction techniques that have been developed for the Responsive Workbench, a tabletop stereo display based on a workbench metaphor [9, 10]. It differs from most classical VR-systems, like head mounted displays (HMDs) and the CAVE <ref> [4] </ref>, that try to immerse users completely in a virtual space. In contrast, the Responsive Workbench allows applications to set virtual objects on top of a real table which is integrated into the user's natural working environment.

Reference-contexts: We also describe many issues in the design, such as how to specify constraints and how to transition between different tasks in a natural way. Finally, we present results and observations of the system in practice. 2 RELATED WORK Guiard <ref> [5] </ref> has studied everyday activities to understand how humans distribute work between their right and left hands. He classifies manual activities into three categories. Certain tasks are inherently unimanual such as throwing darts or brushing one's teeth.

Reference-contexts: Recently work on CHIMP has focused on more asymmetric two-handed manipulation [13]. Hauptmann has studied how users specify graphical object manipulations with a mixture of conversation and hand gestures <ref> [6] </ref>. Many subjects expressed rotations by giving a steering wheel turn or a paddle wheel motion, and most specified scaling by moving the hands apart or together. These experiments suggest that meaning is often naturally conveyed via bimanual symmetric hand motions.

Reference-contexts: Design principles for such environments are largely unknown and certainly not in the same state of development as the modern desktop graphical user interface. This paper describes two-handed interaction techniques that have been developed for the Responsive Workbench, a tabletop stereo display based on a workbench metaphor <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. It differs from most classical VR-systems, like head mounted displays (HMDs) and the CAVE [4], that try to immerse users completely in a virtual space. <p> The advantage of props is that they give the user kinesthetic and tactile feedback which aids in manipulation, and their physical shape provides a crucial affordance as to their appropriate use in the system. 3 THE RESPONSIVE WORKBENCH The Responsive Workbench <ref> [9, 10] </ref> is a virtual environment based on a high resolution tabletop display system. Users interact directly with three dimensional virtual objects, which are projected as stereoscopic images onto the surface of a table (Figure 2). <p> The stylus is a one button device, while PINCH gloves detect different pinches between fingers. The original system as described in <ref> [9, 10] </ref> used a Virtual Technologies CyberGlove, which also provides joint angle information for gesture recognition, but requires more extensive calibration than the PINCH gloves. Navigation in traditional immersive VR systems using HMDs entails flying, walking, or driving around.

Reference-contexts: Kabbash et al.[8] followed Guiard's framework in creating bimanual asymmetric techniques for a drawing/coloring task based on the Toolglass. They showed that two-handed techniques reduce the number of operations, minimize the cognitive load, and enhance performance. This evidence was supported by a follow-up study <ref> [11] </ref> with the Toolglass on two-handed techniques for 2D drawing tasks. All these studies suggest that Guiard's framework is useful in the design of two-handed computer interfaces. In the past few years, several VR systems have been built that enable the use of both hands.
