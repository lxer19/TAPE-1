Earlier, non-layered models had shown tremendous performance improvement [10]. Similar results were expected in the layered model, but early experiments failed to yield the expected performance.

Reference-contexts: It is well known that the performance of conservative algorithms is determined significantly by the lookahead properties of the model <ref> [6] </ref>. Informally, lookahead refers to the ability of a component in a simulation model to compute a tight lower bound on the timestamps of future messages that it will generate. <p> This is a sufficient condition for the entity to ensure that it will not subsequently receive a message with an earlier timestamp. Each entity uses null-messages to send its eot to each of the entities in its destinationset. Simulation proceeds much faster if all simulation objects have large lookahead <ref> [6] </ref>. Lookahead is a promise by a simulation object not to send any messages for a certain period of simulation time. Generally, the lookahead of an entity is the difference between its eit and its eot.

Reference-contexts: Traffic rates, MAC layer protocols, the number of mobiles, and the number of processors were varied to measure various things. The MAC protocols used were CSMA and MACA (multiple access collision avoidance) <ref> [9] </ref>, which requires more computation than CSMA. 4.1 Null Message Production Our first hope in designing this protocol is to reduce the overhead of the null message protocol by reducing the number of null messages produced by the system.

Reference-contexts: Conversely, the destinationset contains all the entities to which the entity might send a message. The earliest output time (eot) of an entity is defined to be the earliest simulation time at which an entity may send a message, regardless of its destination <ref> [13] </ref>. Similarly, the earliest input time (eit) for an entity is defined to be the earliest time at which it may receive a message from any source, and is calculated as follows: eit i = min (eot j ), "j in the sourceset of i. <p> Figure 1 shows the lookahead on each link in the simulation model. By precomputing the arrival times, these large lookaheads can be provided to the rest of the model <ref> [13] </ref>. All real messages in the system follow from those created by the traffic generator, so we expect its good lookahead to propagate to the rest of the system. However, consider the MAC and Radio entities shown in Figure 2. Each starts at time 0.

Reference-contexts: The modular implementation provides the ability to consistently compare multiple protocols designed for a given layer of the protocol stack. A preliminary report on the performance of these implementations as a function of various partitioning algorithms and network characteristics was completed <ref> [15] </ref>. It showed significant improvement in performance with parallel execution, but also showed that there is considerably more potential for performance enhancements than is implied by the speedup achieved in the study.
