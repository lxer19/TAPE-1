Abstract: A frequently encountered problem in urban life is navigation. In order to get to some place we use private means or public transportation, and if we lack clear directions we tend to ask for help. We will deal in this paper with the descriptions of subway routes and their automatic generation. In particular, we will try to show how the relative importance of a given piece of information can effect not only the message but also the form.

Reference-contexts: Concerning the prominence status (i.e. relative importance of a piece of information), semi-oticians and text linguists have reached a similar conclusion by distinguishing between the "foreground/background" or "primary/secondary level" of a text <ref> [Bar66, vD77, AP89, Com92] </ref>. According to Combettes [Com92], the "primary level" deals with the core meaning, i.e. events and facts that make the text progress, while the "secondary level" deals with descriptions, evaluations, comments, and reformulations.

Nevertheless, certain markers do hold 1 In this respect we deviate from most current generation systems. regardless of the text type.

Reference-contexts: This enables us to generate route descriptions which are in line with the ones produced by people. While our work is not the only one dealing with route descriptions (see, for example, <ref> [Kle82, WR82, May90, Maa93, GL95] </ref>), it is original in that it is, according to our knowledge, the only attempt to show how the notion of "relative importance" of route information maps onto linguistic form. The results obtained so far are encouraging.

Reference-contexts: The discourse module is divided into two components. The first one divides the route given by the referential module into conceptual clusters, whereas the second one plans the textual structure of the description. The conceptual structuring consists in dividing a route into segments and landmarks <ref> [Maa93] </ref>. Landmarks are defined in terms of attribute-value pairs of relevant "places" and "paths" which, in our application, correspond respectively to "stops" (stations) and to "portions of subway lines in a given direction". <p> This enables us to generate route descriptions which are in line with the ones produced by people.
