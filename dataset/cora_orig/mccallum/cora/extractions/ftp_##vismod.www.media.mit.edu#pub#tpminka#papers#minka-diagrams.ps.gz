Title: Independence Diagrams  
Author: Thomas P. Minka 
Abstract: Independence diagrams are a graphical way of expressing the conditional independence relationships among a set of random variables. They cannot encode every possible form of conditional independence but they go a long way toward this end. They are also called "Bayesian networks," which unfortunately suggests inappropriate comparisons to neural networks. This paper discusses how to read and write independence diagrams. The pre sentation is based on Pearl (1988).
