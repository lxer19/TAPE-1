Abstract: Timeinvariant nonlinear one-step-ahead prediction models were developed by genetic programming. As a test case benchmark sunspot series was used. Functional form and numerical parameters of the models were optimized. The generalisation ability, i.e. final suitability, of the predictors was assessed through crossvalidation. The results were compared to those of threshold autoregression and neural network -based predictors of the sunspot benchmarks found in literature. Standard GP-approach is shown not to be sufficient to solve this prediction problem as well as the methods in comparison do. We develop timeinvariant nonlinear one-step-ahead prediction models with genetic programming. The time series to predict is the sunspot benchmark series of years 1700-1979. The series is a scaled record of the yearly average sunspot activity. The series is divided into three sets: years 1700-1920 D 0 for developing the prediction model, years 1921-1955 D gen1 and 1956-1979 D gen2 as two
