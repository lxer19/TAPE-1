Abstract: Accurate and numerically efficient models for the complex dielectric function versus wavelength and material characteristics are essential for the use of nondestructive optical techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry or reflectometry. These optical techniques are commonly used for real-time and run-to-run monitoring and control of growth and etch processes to determine a material's composition and thickness. In this work, we discuss an improved composition-dependent model for the complex dielectric function for lattice-matched In 1x Ga x As y P 1y /InP systems valid over the entire composition range 0 y 1. We describe our model, which is an extension of the critical point parabolic band method and is based on the model proposed by Charles Kim et. al. for the Al x Ga 1x As/GaAs system. We demonstrate the quality of the model in fitting optical data for individual compositions, and compare our results to other established models including the harmonic oscillator approximation and the model of Adachi. Using results obtained from the individual fits, we generate a composition-dependent model that is valid for the entire range of lattice-matched compositions. Also, we show how this model can be used to accurately determine the composition ( 0.01) of an unknown material whose dielectric response has been obtained using spectroscopic ellipsometry or a similar technique.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Optical reflection measurement techniques such as spectroscopic ellipsometry [1-3] and reflectom-etry <ref> [4] </ref> are powerful methods for accurately determining the thicknesses of optically thin films. In most cases these methods are completely nondestructive and are, therefore, very useful for both in-situ and ex-situ monitoring for run-to-run control (process optimization), statistical quality control, and real-time control.

Reference-contexts: According to single electron theory, direct interband transitions around high-symmetry regions in the band structure (critical points) dominate the basic structure of the optical dielectric response for most semiconductor materials <ref> [5] </ref>. This theoretical approach neglects the effects of collective (many-body) interactions such as excitons, and ab initio calculations based on single electron theory will not accurately reproduce the dielectric function of a material (see for example [6]).

Reference-contexts: This theoretical approach neglects the effects of collective (many-body) interactions such as excitons, and ab initio calculations based on single electron theory will not accurately reproduce the dielectric function of a material (see for example <ref> [6] </ref>). On the other hand, an accurate first-principles model incorporating all many-body effects would be extremely impractical (if not impossible) to implement, and we expect that including a limited number of such many-body effects would result in modifications of the dielectric response near the critical points.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, a phenomenological model which makes use of single electron theory around 1 critical points but which employs empirically adjustable parameters to incorporate the effects of collective interactions is attractive for optical reflection measurement applications. Also, since critical point energies are a strong function of a material's composition <ref> [7, 8, and references therein] </ref>, this approach is favored over an empirical model such as the harmonic oscillator approximation which has no direct relation to the band structure.

From Vegard's law this composition x = :1896y :4176:0125y <ref> [8] </ref>. In this work, we discuss our model and the theory behind it, using the same notation as in Kim's work for consistency. To create the composition-dependent model, we begin by individually fitting a number of compositions to published data. <p> After generating the individual fits, we use the critical point energies and linewidths from those fits to compute best-fit polynomial composition-dependent equations. Various authors <ref> [8, 18] </ref> have obtained good results using a quadratic fit to the critical point energies, so we also use a quadratic polynomial for our energies. Once those polynomials are calculated, we perform a simultaneous fit to all of our individual data sets to obtain composition-dependent amplitude parameters and baseline parameters. <p> When we first performed this fitting, we found differences between our critical-point energies and those reported in published data <ref> [8, 19] </ref>. Most authors have found E 0 to be between 0.71 and 0.75 eV, and E 0 + 0 to be between 1.04 and 1.10 eV. In our initial fit, we found E 0 = 0.65 eV and E 0 + 0 = 0.99 eV. <p> We are reminded that the quality of any fit hinges directly on the accuracy and quality of the data being fit. Of the other work modeling the dielectric function of In 0:53 Ga 0:47 As, the work by Sadao Adachi <ref> [8, 19, 21] </ref> is generally considered to be the most complete and most accurate. His model also starts out as a summation of critical point effects, but he accounts for the broadening terms differently, by calculating the integral without broadening and later adding a broadening term back into the equation. <p> In addition to the high quality of fit to the spectral data, the values we obtain for the critical point energies also agree well with numbers presented previously in the literature <ref> [8, pages 77, 81, and 83] </ref>. Our fit determined E 0 to be 1.33 0.01 eV. This is in line with values found between 1.337 and 1.35 eV by various authors. <p> Table 3 shows all of the energies obtained by the model described in this paper. In Figure 8 we show how our quadratic fit for E 0 compares to the findings of others <ref> [8, table 6.3, and references therein] </ref>, showing that we do indeed obtain reasonable values for the critical point energies. 13 We then generate composition-dependent amplitude parameters as cubic polynomials by per-forming a simultaneous fit to all of the individual compositions, holding the energies and linewidth polynomial terms fixed.

Still, Adachi's published results for In 0:53 Ga 0:47 As are less accurate than our results for the individual fit (see Figure 3).
