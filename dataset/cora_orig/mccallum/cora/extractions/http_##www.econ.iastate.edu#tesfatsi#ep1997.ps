Abstract: This paper describes an agent-based computational model for studying the formation and evolution of trade networks in decentralized market economies. A virtual economic world is constructed, populated by heterogeneous endogenously interacting traders with internalized data and modes of behavior. This virtual world can be used to study the formation and evolution of trade networks under alternatively specified market structures at three different levels of analysis: individual trade behavior; trade interaction patterns; and social welfare.

Reference-contexts: These parameter settings were chosen to match as closely as possible the "standard scenario" used as a benchmark case by Ashlock et al. <ref> [1, Table 3] </ref> for an IPD game with choice and refusal of partners. The latter authors found that rapid convergence to mutual cooperation took place for this benchmark case, and the TNG results qualitatively replicate this finding.

Reference-contexts: The recent development of agent-based frameworks such as the TNG platform raise new questions concerning the appropriate bounds of economic analysis, for these frameworks can potentially model social activity from a much more inclusive perspective. Indeed, as stressed in Epstein and Axtell <ref> [2] </ref>, such frameworks may at last provide a common paradigm for social science as a whole.

Reference-contexts: Specifically, successful trade strategies are mimicked and unsuccessful trade strategies are replaced by variants of more successful strategies. 3 TNG Implementation The TNG is implemented with support of SimBioSys, a general C++ class framework for evolutionary simulations developed by McFadzean <ref> [3] </ref>. This section briefly outlines this implementation, hereafter referred to as the TNG platform.

The trade strategies associated with the remaining tradebots are then replaced by variants of more successful trade strategies. As detailed in <ref> [4] </ref>, the latter evolutionary process is currently implemented by means of a standardly specified genetic algorithm employing both mutation and two-point crossover operations. The tradebots then enter into a new generation cycle and the entire process repeats. <p> The tradebots then enter into a new generation cycle and the entire process repeats. A more detailed discussion of the implementation of these cycle and step activities is given in <ref> [4] </ref>. 4 Experimental Study of the TNG The TNG platform detailed in the previous section permits the experimental study of TNG outcomes at three different levels of analysis. First, individual tradebot attributes can be directly sampled to assess the evolution of trader types.

Reference-contexts: The determination of trade partners in the TNG is currently implemented using a modified version of the well-known Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance mechanism (see <ref> [5] </ref>). This modified mechanism, hereafter referred to as the de 3 ferred choice and refusal (DCR) mechanism, presumes that each buyer and seller currently associates an expected payoff with each potential trade partner.

Reference-contexts: The present paper discusses the C++ implementation of a particular ACE model developed by Tesfatsion [7] to study the endogenous formation and evolution of trade networks. This model, referred to as the trade network game (TNG), extends to an economic setting an earlier model ([1]), <ref> [6] </ref>) combining evolutionary game play with endogenous partner selection. In the TNG, successive generations of resource-constrained traders choose and refuse trade partners on the basis of continuously updated expected payoffs, engage in risky trades modelled as two-person games, and evolve their trade behavior over time.
