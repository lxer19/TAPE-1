Abstract: Video-on-Demand applications emerge on campus-wide networks. Compressed video streams pass switches which do not have any bandwidth reservation mechanism, nor any other mechanism against congestion. The switches, shared among video servers, WWW servers and clients, get easily congested in critical situations, hence the switches drop packets and the quality of end-to-end delivery service degrades. To provide soft bandwidth (QoS) guarantees for video, we designed and tested through simulation a dynamic end-to-end multi-path protocol for video traffic. We compared our dynamic multi-path protocol performance with a dynamic single-path protocol and the experiments show significant advantages of the dynamic multi-path communication with respect to provision of soft bandwidth guarantees for video traffic. A disadvantage of our approach is the reordering overhead. However, the use of the higher level frame information helps to simplify reordering and the overhead is acceptable.

Reference-contexts: during periods of congestion. * Single-Path Protocol with Dynamic Multi-Path Routing Another possibility to work around the congestion problems (no reservation mechanism exists), and provide the network bandwidth availability in a protocol is to apply a dynamic multi-path routing algorithm during the connection setup phase when choosing the proper path <ref> [1] </ref>. Routing decisions can significantly affect network congestion and load balance. The dynamic multi-path algorithm considers several potential paths for the selection and classifies each of the candidates according to their utilization or load. The path selection is based on a combined heuristics of the shortest path and path utilization. <p> The dynamic multi-path algorithm considers several potential paths for the selection and classifies each of the candidates according to their utilization or load.

The first one is the load distribution among multiple paths to avoid network congestion.

Reference-contexts: Given that the network resources are shared, congestion in the network will occur and they can cause unacceptable performance degradation for the VOD applications due to unavailability of bandwidth. The current solutions use either a connection flow control and feedback mechanism (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>), or a reservation mechanism for a connection (e.g., RSVP, Tenet RCAP, ST-II [8]). <p> This generally results in an underutilization of the re sources <ref> [4] </ref>. * Most of reservation protocols require fixed-routing (e.g., ST-II). The route is decided at its reservation phase and it cannot be changed. However, the network traffic is dynamic and it may change to a state where this fixed path can cause resource fragmentation and poor network load balance. <p> Summary in Section 6 concludes our paper. 2 Related Work The network availability and application flexibility problems due to network congestion and dynamic requirements are addressed in several protocols as follows: * Single-Path Protocol with Network Feedback In the adaptive real-time video transport protocol <ref> [4] </ref> (no reservation exists), the congestion is resolved by sending feedback information from the congested switch to the source and the source reacts to the feedback by decreasing its sending rate. <p> The QoS monitor receives this information and reacts adequately. Our protocol uses two adaptive mechanisms to 2 We are not interested in using receiver feedback to resolve short term network congestion. As pointed out in <ref> [4] </ref> the receiver feedback is not useful for short term congestion. By the time a receiver feedback arrives, the congestion might have been resolved, i.e., the feedback information at that point is obsolete.

Reference-contexts: The route is decided at its reservation phase and it cannot be changed. However, the network traffic is dynamic and it may change to a state where this fixed path can cause resource fragmentation and poor network load balance. This is called the network availability problem described in <ref> [6] </ref>. An example in Figure 1 illustrates this problem. The available bandwidth is fragmented into 50 Mbps on the upper path and 25 Mbps on the lower path. <p> Therefore, the remaining available bandwidth is 50 Mbps on the upper path and 25 Mbps on the lower path. phase and it must behave according to its flow specification during the transmission phase. This is the application flexibility problem described in <ref> [6] </ref>. The VOD application may want to provide support for the users to adjust their desirable QoS (e.g. frame rate and resolution) interactively or according to the current network traffic. The same example in Figure 1 can illustrate this problem. <p> The Tenet RCAP protocol carries this idea on their real time channels <ref> [6] </ref> with the Dynamic Connection Management (DCM). The DCM decides if a real-time channel should be rerouted to an alternative route, called the shadow channel. Recall the example in Figure 1. <p> The type 2 request contains the sender/receiver pairs and its additional bandwidth QoS. This algorithm is applied in a similar fashion as for a type 1 request. Similar algorithms are described in <ref> [6] </ref>. lines are the paths computed. The values on the links are the available bandwidth, the values in parenthesizes are the bandwidth for the path computed. The computed paths and their available bandwidth are returned to the requesting connection for initialization or update of its path table.

Reference-contexts: Note that our simple algorithm is not the focus of this paper. Its design may not be optimal or competitive in many aspects <ref> [7] </ref>. As mentioned above, the routing server accepts 2 types of routing request. The type 1 request contains the sender/receiver pairs, its bandwidth QoS (req bandwidth), and an initial degree of multi-path (init deg). Our algorithm finds a minimum of init deg number of paths for this new connection.

Reference-contexts: The current solutions use either a connection flow control and feedback mechanism (e.g., [4]), or a reservation mechanism for a connection (e.g., RSVP, Tenet RCAP, ST-II <ref> [8] </ref>). The former approach uses a flow control mechanism at the source to regulate sending video data over the network via a single path, and if congestion still occurs in the network, feedback is sent to decrease the sending rate at the source.
