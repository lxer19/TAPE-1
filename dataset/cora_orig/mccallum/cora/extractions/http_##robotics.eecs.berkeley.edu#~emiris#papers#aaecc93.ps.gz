Abstract: AN EFFICIENT ALGORITHM FOR THE SPARSE RESULTANT Abstract. We propose a compact formula for the sparse resultant of an arbitrary system of n+1 Laurent polynomials in n variables. This resultant generalizes the classical one and has significantly lower degree for polynomials that are sparse in the sense that their Mixed Volume is lower than the Bezout bound. Our algorithm constructs a matrix whose determinant is a nonzero multiple of the resultant so that the latter can be obtained as the GCD of n + 1 such determinants. An improved variant yields typically smaller matrices with the same properties. For any specialization of the coefficients there are two methods which use one extra perturbation variable and return the sparse resultant. Our algorithm is the first to present a determinantal formula for arbitrary systems and its complexity, for unmixed systems, is polynomial in the resultant degree and simply exponential in n. Empirical results suggest that the asymptotic complexity is the same for most mixed systems encountered in practice. The algorithm is illustrated for a bivariate example. We conjecture its extension to producing an exact rational expression for the sparse resultant. Key words.

Reference-contexts: Emiris and Rege offer a simpler proof based on the present sparse resultant algorithm and show how root-finding reduces to an eigenproblem [14]. This result extends older work in <ref> [1] </ref>. An important observation here is that it is usually not necessary to find the exact sparse resultant; instead, one of the determinants obtained, which is a nontrivial multiple, suffices for recovering the system's roots. A related problem of independent significance is the computation of Mixed Volumes.

Reference-contexts: Most polynomial systems which arise in a variety of areas including robot kinematics, vision, mechanism design, graphics and geometric modeling are sparse in this sense. In general, the sparse resultant has smaller degree than its classical counterpart because its degree depends on the Bernstein bound <ref> [3] </ref> on the number of affine roots for a square polynomial system. Bernstein's bound is at most equal to Bezout's and for sparse systems it is substantially smaller and often exact. <p> The Bezout bound is 2 n+1 , though the number of solutions is only 2n, two opposite eigenvectors per eigenvalue.

Reference-contexts: For mixed systems, this is the first algorithm that produces a determinantal formula; it first appeared in preliminary form in <ref> [5] </ref>. Empirical results and a heuristic analysis imply that, for most mixed systems in practice, the same complexity bounds hold. Our approach consists of expressing a non-trivial multiple of the sparse resultant as a matrix determinant in the given coefficients. For two univariate polynomials our algorithm yields the Sylvester matrix.

Reference-contexts: The algorithm generalizes Sylvester's algorithm for two univariate polynomials, since it produces Sylvester's resultant matrix in this case. For an arbitrary number of dense polynomials, the algorithm produces the classical resultant. The application of the sparse resultant to solving polynomial systems is described in <ref> [14] </ref>, where it is used to solve an important problem in vision, namely to compute the motion of a camera between two positions from 5 point matches [15]. <p> Emiris and Rege offer a simpler proof based on the present sparse resultant algorithm and show how root-finding reduces to an eigenproblem <ref> [14] </ref>. This result extends older work in [1].

In settling the complexity issue for mixed systems, the main open question concerns the relationship between the Mixed Volume of n polytopes and the volume of their Minkowski Sum. Characterizing the systems for which an optimal determinantal formula does not exist is an active area of research.

Reference-contexts: Further, for certain classes of systems such as the multigraded ones, the randomized step can be avoided and an optimal Sylvester-type formula is constructed. For solving square systems of polynomial equations, certain properties of the sparse resultant must be established. This was essentially accomplished in <ref> [33] </ref>, where it was shown that certain monomials defined during the computation of mixed subdivisions constitute a basis of the coordinate ring associated to the variety of the given polynomials.

Reference-contexts: The resultant of two homogeneous polynomials was first studied by Euler and Bezout, though its optimal formulation is named after Sylvester. He expressed it as the determinant of a matrix whose entries are either zero or some polynomial coefficient <ref> [34] </ref>. In this case, and whenever the resultant is expressible as the determinant of a single matrix, we have a Sylvester-type formula. This is generally possible for n = 3 thanks to Dixon's matrix which provides an optimal expression [10]. For higher n, Sylvester-type formulae do not exist in general.

Reference-contexts: Thus we have an almost guaranteed method of constructing the resultant at the cost of adding the single variable u. More precisely, to bound the probability of failure by 1=c for some arbitrary c &gt; 1 it suffices <ref> [36, Lemma 1] </ref>, to pick the coefficients of 14 each h i uniformly distributed and independently, each with c log jEj bits. It is possible to detect failure deterministically, in which case new randomized variables must be chosen. <p> GCD Method. This method requires that the coefficients of the given specialized system g 1 ; : : : ; g n+1 be nonzero and chosen from some polynomial ring over Q. Again we choose polynomials h i with random coefficients, whose size is given by Schwartz's lemma <ref> [36, Lemma 1] </ref>, and specialize (f 1 ; : : : ; f n+1 ) 7! (g 1 + uh 1 ; : : : ; g n+1 + uh n+1 ): By Hilbert's irreducibility theorem, R will remain irreducible over Q [u] after almost all such specializations.

The number of integer lattice points in a half-open integral paral-lelotope equals its volume. Proof. It follows from <ref> [37, Remark, p.335] </ref> that the number of these lattice points is n!Vol (S) where S is the simplex Conv (0; e 1 ; : : : ; e n ). The volume of the parallelotope HO is known to be n!Vol (S). Corollary 6.2.

Reference-contexts: However this construction has no practical significance. The first constructive methods for computing and evaluating the sparse resultant were proposed by Sturmfels in <ref> [38] </ref>, the most efficient 5 having complexity super-polynomial in the degree of the resultant and exponential in n with a quadratic exponent. For multigraded systems an optimal formula of Sylvester type is given in [40].

Reference-contexts: This lattice is identified with ZZ n possibly after a change of variables, which can be implemented by applying Smith's Normal form <ref> [39] </ref>. <p> Computationally it is preferable to obtain the resultant via a series of n alternating divisions of determinants, similarly to Cayley's method. Certain assumptions made by the algorithm have been removed by Sturmfels <ref> [39] </ref>. A different algorithm has been proposed by Emiris and Canny in order to construct matrices of optimal or near-optimal size [12]. Using a randomized step, the new algorithm comes close to this goal in most cases, while its asymptotic complexity is similarly reduced. <p> This is clearly a many-to-one mapping. We wish, for each q 2 Q, to define a unique inverse (p 1 ; : : : ; p n+1 ) under (2) in Q 1 fi fiQ n+1 . To this end a method from <ref> [39] </ref> is employed: Choose n + 1 sufficiently generic linear lifting forms l 1 ; : : : ; l n+1 2 ZZ [x 1 ; : : : ; x n ]; we shall formalize below the genericity requirement on l i . <p> By the mul-tilinearity of Mixed Volume it can be shown that the total volume of these cells equals MV (Q 2 ; : : : ; Q n+1 ) <ref> [39] </ref>. So the number of rows containing coefficients of f 1 is precisely MV (Q 2 ; : : : ; Q n+1 ).

Reference-contexts: For multigraded systems an optimal formula of Sylvester type is given in <ref> [40] </ref>. These are unmixed multihomogeneous systems where every polynomial is homogeneous of degree d j in each group of variables x j , x j has l j + 1 variables and for each j, l j = 1 or d j = 1.

Reference-contexts: Hurwitz [19] introduced inertia forms, which are matrix determinants that express nontrivial multiples of the resultant, such that their GCD equals the resultant. Probably the best exposition of most of this material is found in <ref> [41] </ref>, where the U -resultant is suggested as a tool for solving algebraic systems. Macaulay [28] gave the most compact expression of the classical resultant as the quotient of a determinant divided by one of its minors; notice that the numerator determinant is an inertia form. <p> For deterministic choices of the lifing forms, the row content function and the perturbation vector, the above algorithm yields exactly Macaulay's matrices whose determinants are the inertia forms of Hurwitz; the respective algorithms are presented in [22] and <ref> [41, Sect. 81] </ref>. Specifically, let ffi = (1; : : : ; 1); l n+1 = Lx 1 + + Lx n ; where L 2 ZZ &gt;0 is sufficiently large so that it exceeds any sum of n + 1 coordinates of Newton polytope vertices.

Reference-contexts: A related problem of independent significance is the computation of Mixed Volumes. Different algorithms and implementations have been suggested for the general as well as special cases <ref> [18, 12, 42, 13] </ref>; the most efficient method for the general case is the last one. Sparse homotopies have been proposed in order to decrease the number of paths followed, by relating their cardinality to Bernstein's bound rather than Bezout's [18, 42]. <p> Sparse homotopies have been proposed in order to decrease the number of paths followed, by relating their cardinality to Bernstein's bound rather than Bezout's <ref> [18, 42] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Characterizing the systems for which an optimal determinantal formula does not exist is an active area of research.
