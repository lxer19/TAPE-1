Abstract: To develop an initial understanding of complex data, one often begins with exploration. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) provides a set of statistical tools through which patterns in data may be extracted and examined in detail. The search space of EDA operations is enormous, too large to be explored directly in a data-driven manner. More abstract EDA procedures can be captured, however, by representations commonly used in AI planning systems. We describe an implemented planning representation for Aide, an automated EDA assistant, with a focus on control issues.

Reference-contexts: In the case of regression, one explores to see whether there are nonlinear relationships between a regression variable and a regressor, or whether there are patterns in residuals [Daniel80]. In cluster analysis one searches for functional relationships that may distort cluster shapes <ref> [Chen74] </ref>. In causal modeling one searches for patterns that influence conditional independence [StAmant94b]. Modeling constrains the application of EDA operations and supplies context for interpretation of their results. 3 A Brief Example Much of our research deals with the behavior of AI planners in demanding simulation environments.

Reference-contexts: ?histogram) :vars (variable directives (histogram :output)) :features ((:content-type :categorical)) :bindings ((histogram (partitions index count))) :grammar (:SEQUENCE (script-partition variable 'identity :output histogram :names '(partition index)) (script-transform histogram #'(lambda (partition) (script-reduce partition 'count)) :key (attributes partitions) :name count))) The scripting language is based on work in control planning for knowledge-based signal processing <ref> [Carver93] </ref>. In its simplest form, a script has a goal form with input and output variables, a set of bindings, and a grammar of actions to execute. Grammar constructs allow sequencing, iteration, 5 mapping, and conditionalizing of actions. <p> This representation restructures the search space of exploration into a more appropriate form. Unfortunately, the problem of choosing an appropriate search operation still applies, even at this higher level. The space remains too large to be searched with only data-driven operations. Control planning addresses the problem <ref> [Carver93] </ref>. Control plans are a simple extension of data manipulation scripts. A control plan grammar contains subgoals rather than actions, and can implement more general procedures than those provided by scripts. Control plans guide the activation of data manipulation scripts and other control plans.

Reference-contexts: Exploration is a kind of detective work: to make a formal presentation of a case, the researcher must follow subtle and potentially conflicting clues to a set of possible conclusions. Exploratory results give rise to confirmatory studies in a cycle of successively more refined exploration and confirmation <ref> [Cohen95, Hand86] </ref>. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) offers a wide range of statistical tools for the early stages of analysis [Tukey77].

Reference-contexts: Modeling procedures serve to focus exploration. Such procedures include regression analysis, discriminant analysis, clustering, and causal modeling. In the case of regression, one explores to see whether there are nonlinear relationships between a regression variable and a regressor, or whether there are patterns in residuals <ref> [Daniel80] </ref>. In cluster analysis one searches for functional relationships that may distort cluster shapes [Chen74]. In causal modeling one searches for patterns that influence conditional independence [StAmant94b].

Reference-contexts: A data decomposition breaks a dataset into smaller parts; dataset-level attribute transformations compute a set of features of the reduced data; these features are explored both individually and in aggregate.

Reference-contexts: In this case, N explains the clustering of resource costs. This description, though brief, should give the flavor of the analysis. To summarize, we begin with initial descriptions of the data, such as the observation of gaps between adjacent values. From these we generate indications <ref> [Mosteller77] </ref>, or suggestive characteristics: the data fall into clusters. 3 Based on these indications we apply specific EDA procedures: we break the data down and analyze the clusters individually. These procedures may involve iterative refinement, as with the alternative descriptions of clusters in S.

One such system is TransSim, a transportation planner/simulator <ref> [Oates94] </ref>. In TransSim, ships travel between ports carrying cargo along assigned routes. Bottlenecks and other occurrences change the environment in unexpected ways. The planner must react dynamically to these changes by rescheduling dock and ship assignments and rerouting cargo through different intermediate ports.

In Aide, data-directed mechanisms extract simple observations and suggestive indications from the data.

Control plans guide the EDA operations, relying on intermediate results for their decisions.

Reference-contexts: Exploratory results give rise to confirmatory studies in a cycle of successively more refined exploration and confirmation [Cohen95, Hand86]. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) offers a wide range of statistical tools for the early stages of analysis <ref> [Tukey77] </ref>. Simple exploratory procedures generate histograms of discrete and continuous variables, scatter plots and box plots for bivariate relationships, partitions of relationships that distinguish different modes of behavior, simplified functional relationships, and two-way tables such as contingency tables. <p> Aide is currently a prototype under development. Though capable of the analysis we present here, Aide has not yet been extensively tested. 2 The Problem In Exploratory Data Analysis <ref> [Tukey77, p.v] </ref>, John Tukey describes EDA in this way: A basic problem about any body of data is to make it more easily and effectively handleable by minds|our minds, her mind, his mind.
