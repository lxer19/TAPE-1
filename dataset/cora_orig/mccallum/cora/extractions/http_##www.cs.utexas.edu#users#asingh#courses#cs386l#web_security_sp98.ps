Title: Issues Contemporary Approaches In Mobile Code Security  
Author: Amit Singh 
Note: in partial fulfilment of the course CS386l: Advanced Programming Languages Guide: Dr.Calvin Lin  
Abstract: The World Wide Web has seen an exponential growth in the last five years. There has been a concomitant increase in the strength of the Internet programming community, mobile code technologies and related tools. "E-Commerce", which is yet to come out of its shell, is expected to add its share to the proliferation. Consequently, issues of security, safety and performance have become increasingly conspicuous, and indeed deserve special attention. This paper dwells with the problems arising out of mobile code, the coeval approaches to a "secure Internet", and illustrates through examples, some of the flagrant abuse of mobile code technology. I dichotomize the discussion into hardware and software approaches to security, and the corresponding pros and cons. At the end, I conclude with the harsh realization that despite the multitude of security measures and the range of powerful features, there is no one best policy that one could qualify as the policy. We are far from the desideratum of a safe Internet.

Reference-contexts: The hardware based method needs to access page tables and system calls but such facilities are not available universally across the platforms making this method less portable in comparison to Software based protection. Further, it has been shown <ref> [1] </ref> that the hardware protection slows the execution of the programs by about 7 to 9 times where as the software protection affects the speed by about 0.5only. * Capabilities- A push method of giving resources to an Applet. A Capability is an unforgeable pointer to controlled system resources.

Reference-contexts: At this stage, the only silver lining in the cloud seems to be the fact that: "The Internet at this stage is not that insecure as we think it to be. Records show that more than 80% of the exposure comes from within the organization <ref> [8] </ref> than from alien hackers. Good sense seems to prevail".
