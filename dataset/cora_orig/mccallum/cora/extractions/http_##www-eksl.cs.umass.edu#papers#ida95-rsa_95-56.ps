Abstract: To develop an initial understanding of complex data, one often begins with exploration. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) provides a set of statistical tools through which patterns in data may be extracted and examined in detail. We briefly describe an implemented planning representation for Aide, an automated EDA assistant. We discuss the analysis of a small dataset, in which exploration is driven by a set of variable selection algorithms. Our results, derived through a semi-autonomous process in which the user oversees the decisions Aide makes, are comparable with those produced by earlier researchers.
