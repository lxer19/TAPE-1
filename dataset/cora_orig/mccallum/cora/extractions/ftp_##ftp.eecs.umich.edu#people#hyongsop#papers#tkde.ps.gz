Reference-contexts: Entirely delegating the June 19, 1997 DRAFT 18 responsibility of generating the awareness information to collaborators tends to make it unlikely that collaborators will generate/use the information and render awareness features counter-productive. To this end, Dourish and Bellotti <ref> [4] </ref> argue for the shared feedback approach.

Reference-contexts: A multi-user scrollbar also identifies users' locations in a shared workspace. Instead of using a miniaturized shared workspace, however, the multi-user scrollbar is directly incorporated into the shared window that displays the shared workspace. The study <ref> [9] </ref> conducted by the Groupkit designers indicates that users heavily rely on the awareness information provided by awareness widgets, especially the radar view, to coordinate their work with the others.

Reference-contexts: The list may also include contact information from their business cards, which, for instance, could be used to send electronic mail to individual participants. The shared workspace may also serve as a source of awareness <ref> [21] </ref>. For example, in group editing, the knowledge about the part of a shared paper each author is viewing may provide clues as to what each author is currently working on. Awareness information should be seamlessly incorporated into users' work environments and be easily accessible. <p> A. Awareness Widgets Groupkit <ref> [21] </ref> is a toolkit for building a general class of collaborative applications and includes a number of awareness widgets for use in GroupKit-based applications. An awareness widget is a user interface object, such as windows and scrollbars, that is specifically designed to provide awareness information.

Reference-contexts: Moving an object is similar to copying an object except that the object is removed from the room from which it is moved. TeamWave <ref> [22] </ref> is another system that uses the room metaphor for representing a shared workspace. In TeamWave, a group of users is given a shared window manager in which the windows of individual collaboration tools used for their group work are displayed.
