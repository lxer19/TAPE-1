Title: Fundamental Design Issues for the Future Internet

Abstract: The Internet has been a startling and dramatic success. However, multimedia applications, with their novel traffic characteristics and service requirements, pose an interesting challenge to the technical foundations of the Internet. In this paper we address some of the fundamental architectural design issues facing the future Internet. In particular, we discuss whether the Internet should adopt a new service model, how this service model should be invoked, and whether this service model should include admission control. These architectural issues are discussed in a nonrigorous manner, through the use of a utility function formulation and some simple models. While we do advocate some design choices over others, the main purpose here is to provide a framework for discussing the various architectural alternatives.

Reference-contexts: not done in the application itself but rather in the transport protocol TCP. 6 We discuss these characteristics at much greater length in [36]. 7 We won't describe implementation issues at all in this paper, except to say that traditional implementations of real-time applications involve either fixed play-back points (see <ref> [3, 36] </ref>) or, even worse, immediate play-back of incoming data. <p> Most of these papers implicitly assume that such modifications are necessary and hence give little justification for the basic approach (this author also pleads guilty to this crime; see <ref> [3] </ref>); instead the focus in these papers is on the details of the design and comparison with other similar architectures. The purpose of this paper is to articulate some of the basic issues in what has been an underarticulated disagreement about basic architectural assumptions. <p> This service model could be as simple as two priority levels, or as complicated as the multiple delay-bounded service classes described in <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As discussed in <ref> [4, 35] </ref>, pricing can be used to spread the benefits of increasing V to all applications; for some applications, the reduction in the quality of service is compensated by the reduction in price, and for others the increase in price is compensated by the increase in the quality of service. <p> Clearly, these incentive issues are extremely important and many issues remain unresolved.

Reference-contexts: Or a university may want to make sure that bandwidth on the access line to the Internet is evenly split between various departments. One can use packet scheduling algorithms to accomplish this form of link-sharing; see <ref> [5, 13, 36, 39] </ref> for examples.

Reference-contexts: automatic browsers (agents automatically browsing the Internet and retrieving anything that looks interesting) are widely deployed, the Internet will suffer. 21 Even in the absence of multiple qualities of service, we need some incentive system to discourage or at least prioritize use; MacKie-Mason and Varian have explored this issue in <ref> [29] </ref>. Thus, while usage-based pricing may be a terrible thing, we need to confront its existence regardless of our decisions about extending the service model. <p> Clearly, these incentive issues are extremely important and many issues remain unresolved.

Reference-contexts: The functions U i are then functions of a single variable and can be more easily analyzed. Our question is: what do typical utility functions look like? Since we care only about the qualitative properties of these functions, and there is little hard evidence for their shape (see <ref> [42] </ref>), we will make only guesses about their qualitative properties. Traditional data applications like file transfer, electronic mail, and remote terminal are rather tolerant of delays. <p> Certainly at high bandwidths the marginal utility of additional bandwidth is very slight because the signal quality is much better than humans need. It also appears that at very small bandwidths, the marginal utility is very slight because the signal quality is unbearably low (see <ref> [42] </ref> for some human factors studies).
