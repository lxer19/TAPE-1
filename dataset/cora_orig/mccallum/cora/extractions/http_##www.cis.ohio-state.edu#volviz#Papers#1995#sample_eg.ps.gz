Abstract: Reconstruction is imperative whenever an image or a volume needs to be resampled as a result of an af fine or perspective transformation, texture mapping, or volume rendering. We present a new method for the characterization and measurement of reconstruction error. Our method, based on spatial domain error analysis, uses approximation theory to develop error bounds. We provide, for the first time, an efficient way to guarantee an error bound at every point by varying the filter size. We go further to support position-adaptive and data-adaptive reconstruction which adjust filter size to the location of reconstruction and the data in its vicinity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with suitable

Reference-contexts: In Section 3 we describe our approach and finally in Section 4 we present our results. 2. Background Much has been written about the reconstruction of sampled datasets in signal processing (1D data) [12] or image processing applications (2D data) [4][19] and computer graphics <ref> [2] </ref>. Another body of work on the same problem is available in the applied mathematics literature [15][22]. Although the terminology in the following discussion is pertinent to 1D signals, it is also applicable to 2D and 3D signals. <p> However, none of the proposed measures are well suited for determining the accuracy of an interpolation or filtering scheme on a sampled dataset. Carlbom on the other hand takes into consideration the error incurred by an interpolation filter while designing optimal filters <ref> [2] </ref>. However, this error is defined in the frequency domain and only measures the deviation of the frequency spectrum from the ideal spectrum. Also, this metric is global in nature and does not provide error control on a point-wise basis.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, reconstruction is needed when a 3D volume is sliced [14] or rendered <ref> [5] </ref> [6] [18] [20]. Either the voxel intensity, or the opacity, or color needs to be determined at intermediate points inside the volume. Interpolation is the reconstruction method of choice in all the aforementioned algorithms [5][6][20].

Thus the saving in computational time can be considerable. This savings is especially useful in volume ray-casting <ref> [6] </ref>. To obtain accuracy it is common to step along the ray using small increments and thus increase the number of resampling points. A data-adaptive scheme similar to the one presented here would be very useful to guide the reconstruction process.

Reference-contexts: This gives us an efficient yet accurate resampling method. In the following section we provide the necessary theory and develop adaptive, spatial-domain methods. 3. Reconstruction Error Estimates In this section we provide estimates of truncation error and the non-Sinc error. A more comprehensive treatment is available in <ref> [8] </ref>. We do not attempt to provide any new estimates for overshoot error here. 3.1 Truncation Error Estimates Let the resampling point R at x lie in cell n, i.e., between data points f s (nh)and f s ((n+1)h). <p> For multiple dimensions one can use a product of two or three 1-D window functions. (18) In this section we described the errors that arise from filtering operations. Detailed explanations and derivations were not provided here can be found in <ref> [8] </ref>. In the Section 4 we use these measures to predict reconstruction errors that arise from representative resampling operations and then show how they can be used to perform adaptive reconstruction. 4. Results In this section we first test the validity of the bounds on 1-D signals.

Reference-contexts: The resulting error from ringing cannot be described by the Cardinal series expansion of Equation 1 and must be considered separately. Marschner and Lobb characterize this undesirable effect as the overshoot error and provide a way to measure it <ref> [9] </ref>. The error is obtained by convolving a step function with the reconstruction filter and then measuring the maximum deviation of reconstructed function from the original function. We denote this error as e o . <p> In [13] Parker et al. compare the ef fectiveness of some resampling filters. However, they propose no metrics which can be used to judge the goodness of a resampling filter. Mitchell and Netravalli [10] first introduced the reconstruction metrics pre-aliasing and postaliasing. Marschner and Lobb <ref> [9] </ref> further characterize postaliasing artifacts; the proposed metrics, smoothing, postaliasing, and overshoot, can help design a suitable f ilter. However, none of the proposed measures are well suited for determining the accuracy of an interpolation or filtering scheme on a sampled dataset. <p> Once again we are determining the difference in the areas of the two filter functions. (17) The function NS can be any realizable filter. We however use windowed Sinc filters given their ability to lend themselves to adaptive use. Also, in <ref> [9] </ref> it was shown that windowed Sinc f ilters compare favorably with other filters in terms of the smoothing and post-aliasing metrics defined therein.

Reference-contexts: Although separable f ilters are fast and easily implemented, separability introduces anisotropic effects since the 2D or 3D separable filter is aligned with the principal axes <ref> [10] </ref>. Anisotropic effects are always present unless a radially symmetric filter is employed. <p> In practice, the function is never reconstructed with a truncated Sinc. Truncation is tantamount to multiplying the infinite filter by a spatially limited rectangular window causing aliasing in the frequency spectrum, thereby altering the filters frequency characteristics. A commonly used interpolation filter is cubic convolution <ref> [10] </ref>, which possesses a reasonably good frequency response. If computational cost is a concern trilinear interpolation (a cone filter) is used. Yet another way to design filters is to use a window function besides a rectangle [4][9][12]. <p> In [13] Parker et al. compare the ef fectiveness of some resampling filters. However, they propose no metrics which can be used to judge the goodness of a resampling filter.

Ringing occurs when one approximates a function with a sharp discontinuity . All filters suffer from this effect; however it is more pronounced in the case of truncated Sinc functions. <p> s Max px sin rp cos e f x n h M, , , , E M ( ) 2p 2 M e f x n h M, , , , Max M ( ) S t h,( ) NS t h,( ) td Mh 6 tion schemes (Equation 18) <ref> [12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, none of the above characterizations is conducive to the idea of adapting the f ilter size to the resampling location and to local data characteristics. Adaptive f iltering methods have been reported [1 1], <ref> [16] </ref>. However, these methods derive their adaptivity in the frequency domain and hence are cumbersome to use. Also, these methods are not driven by any user defined error threshold. Our method, on the other hand, operates in the spatial domain. <p> The advantage of this slicing implementation over others is in its ability to control the resampling scheme. A further optimization is obtained if the zero-phase property of Equation 4 is not used <ref> [16] </ref>. We use a neighborhood of size 2M along each dimension instead in a fashion similar to what is done with cubic convolution filters. Figure 3a and Figure 3b show two different slices of a 256 3 volume MRI head dataset.

However, both forms of reconstruction are equivalent and in this paper we shall examine reconstruction in terms of function interpolation.

Reference-contexts: However, in the presence of a large number of sampled data points, the computation can be prohibitively expensive. We now list some tractable error bounds that can be used in practice. The error bound for this infinite sum can be found by resorting to complex analysis <ref> [21] </ref>. However, before we state the relevant results we discuss an important idea of frequency guards. A frequency guard of width r, 0&lt;r<1 implies that there exists no frequency in the signal beyond rw c , where w c is the cutoff frequency. <p> The frequency guard band can be found by determining the ratio of the maximum significant frequency of the spectrum and the cutoff frequency. However, for most graphics applications it is sufficient to use very crude estimates. The methodology used in <ref> [21] </ref> can be applied to determining the error of any polynomial approximation scheme. The error bound can be obtained in terms of either the maximum of the function value Max f , or the spectral energy of the function, E f .
