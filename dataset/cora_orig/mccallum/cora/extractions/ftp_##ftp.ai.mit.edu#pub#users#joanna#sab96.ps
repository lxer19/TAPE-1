Abstract: Much of the success of behavior based robotics can be attributed to the minimal representation approach proposed by Brooks in the mid-eighties(Brooks 1991). However, this has lead to a general "fear of state" which in turn leads to a neglect of the role of state in intelligent control. This paper discusses the need for propagating decision points in action selection in order to coordinate complex behavior. It also proposes a mechanism for doing this while maintaining reactive responsiveness to the real world. This mechanism involves the use of fixed action patterns and specialized behavior prioritization. The result is to focus control attention without prescribing a fixed course of action.

Reference-contexts: In fact, all behaviors are operating continuously and in parallel. Their outputs, which are the actions of the robot, vary appropriately with the state of the world. 3 A consequence of this form of action selection is what Agre and Chapman call "reactive planning." <ref> (Agre & Chapman 1988) </ref> Agre and Chapman (and Brooks) deny the utility of an extended sequence of actions based on formal reasoning from a static model of the world.

Parallels between Shakey's architecture and that of reactive systems have been drawn before in an effort to belittle the more recent accomplishments. <p> Every "higher" function then had the responsibility of checking the model at every step to ascertain whether the previous action was successful. To this extent, Shakey used its model to simplify its control. 2.3 What Genghis Does Instead Genghis <ref> (Brooks 1989) </ref> (and the other subsumption-architecture robots built before and after it) performed most of these same functions without any internal representation. The "most" is telling, but the functions it did perform, it largely performed better and faster.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the key components of the successes of the "new AI" approach to autonomous agents has been the abandonment of the practice of constructing and reasoning from explicit, internal models of the environment. In "Intelligence Without Representation" <ref> (Brooks 1991) </ref> Brooks documents a methodological approach, subsumption architecture, that led to the first generation of robots able to autonomously and robustly negotiate their worlds at animal-like speeds. The heart of this advance is the decomposition of intelligent control into units of behavior.

Reference-contexts: As can be seen from this code, Whitehead's thesis was concerned mostly with the perceptual task. The perceptual operations and state variables 7 derive from David Chapman's implementation of Shimon Ullman's "Visual Routines Theory" of the visual system <ref> (Chapman 1990) </ref>. Obviously, in a real robot, grasping and placing would also have to be competences.

Reference-contexts: Clearly the model needs to be refined, but it serves as a demonstration of the main argument of the paper. It should also be acknowledged that, as an architecture, it is not particularly unique. It resembles the architectures presented in <ref> (Correia & ao 1995) </ref>, which is also FAP inspired, and the competences resemble TR (Nilsson 1994). Both these architectures have been successfully implemented in mobile robots. But both projects have substantially different conceptualizations of their underlying model from the one presented here.

Reference-contexts: It turns out to be better to use the world as its own model. H | Representation is the wrong unit of abstraction in building the bulkiest parts of intelligent systems. [(Brooks 1991) p.140] This representational minimalist approach has proven useful not only for fairly complex robots like Polly <ref> (Horswill 1993) </ref> and Genghis (Brooks 1989), but for telephone network balancing (Appleby & Steward 1994) and laser head control (Pebody 1995). Unfortunately, this work has been misconstrued as an extremist position that intelligent control should require no state, and the misconception that a reactive architecture is a stateless one. <p> This robot could take multiple goals | it could be asked to navigate to any of the locations it had learned. 2 This is essentially the obstacle avoidance algorithm for Polly <ref> (Horswill 1993) </ref>, though the sensors are three subdivisions of the visual scene returned by a single camera. 4 during this avoidance, the robot is not getting any signal from its sensors.

Reference-contexts: Another motive for this choice of domain was that we have a functional visual routine processor of the type postulated in Whitehead's work (see <ref> (Horswill 1995) </ref>), and so have hope of implementing the system on a real robot.

Reference-contexts: In this case, the robot needs to back up and turn away from the obstacle to avoid it. Notice that 1 Flexible state in a top level goal was introduced for a subsumption-architecture robot named Toto <ref> (Mataric 1990) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Possibly an appropriate representation of motor control is an integral part of an appropriate representation of memory for motor tasks. The idea of associating goal tasks with motor memories comes close to the model of mouse navigation researched by McNaughton <ref> (McNaughton et al. 1996) </ref>. They have a body of experimental evidence indicating that mouse spatial representation consists of matrices of ideothetic information combined with loose associations to goals and landmarks. These landmarks serve both to index and to recalibrate the ideothetic information.

Reference-contexts: However, partly because of our 5 interest in developing a learning system, we chose to use the action primitives, sensing capabilities, domain and tasks described in Steve Whitehead's well-known, blocks-world based learning thesis, "Reinforcement Learning for the Adaptive Control of Perception and Action" <ref> (Whitehead 1992) </ref>. Another motive for this choice of domain was that we have a functional visual routine processor of the type postulated in Whitehead's work (see (Horswill 1995)), and so have hope of implementing the system on a real robot.

Reference-contexts: This marker has considerably less operations than "action" or "attention"; it is more like the location "hand" in Whitehead's thesis than a true marker. I also implemented a trivial version of "the copy demo," <ref> (Winston 1972) </ref> a block stacking task where the goal (another location) is another stack of blocks, also viewed. With the goal thus externalized I was able to simplify the structural competence, although I found it necessary to create a specialized perceptual competence for comparing the piles.
