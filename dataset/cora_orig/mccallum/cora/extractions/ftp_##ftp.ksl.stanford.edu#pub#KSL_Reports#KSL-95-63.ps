Title: Collaborative Ontology Construction for Information Integration  
Author: Adam Farquhar, Richard Fikes, Wanda Pratt, James Rice 
Keyword: Ontology, worldwide web interfaces, interoperation, knowledge reuse  
Abstract: Information integration is enabled by having a precisely defined common terminology. We call this combination of terminology and definitions an ontology . We have developed a set of tools and services to support the process of achieving consensus on such a common shared ontologies by geographically distributed groups. These tools make use of the worldwide web to enable wide access and provide users with the ability to publish, browse, create, and edit ontologies stored on an ontology server . Users can quickly assemble a new ontology from a library of modules. We discuss how our system was constructed, how it exploits existing protocols and browsing tools, and our experience supporting hundreds of users. We describe applications using our tools to achieve consensus on ontologies and to integrate information. The ontology server may be accessed through the URL http://www-ksl-svc.stanford.edu:5915/

Reference-contexts: We have been working to develop and disseminate effective easy-to-use tools for creating, evaluating, accessing, using, and maintaining reusable ontologies <ref> (Fikes, Cutkosky, Gruber, & van Baalen, 1991) </ref>. We have developed a set of tools and services to support not only the development of ontologies by individuals, but also the process of achieving consensus on common ontologies by distributed groups.

Reference-contexts: Facilities for translating ontologies from repositories into typical application environments. We have developed translators from ontologies into a number of representations including CORBAs IDL (Mowbray & Zahavi, 1995), Prolog, CLIPS, LOOM (MacGregor, 1990) , Epikit <ref> (Genesereth, 1990) </ref>, KIF (Genesereth & Fikes, 1992). Facilities for programmatic access to ontologies so that remote applications have reliable access to up-to-date term definitions.

Reference-contexts: We use an extended version of the Ontolingua language (Gruber, 1992) which provides a frame-like syntax in addition to full first order logic as specified in the Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) <ref> (Genesereth, 1991) </ref> . The language supports semiformal definitions through the use of documentation strings and notes in addition to the formal specifications. Browsing and retrieval of ontologies from repositories. Browsing requires presentation of formal descriptions in an easily understood format.

Reference-contexts: In order to determine if patients are eligible to participate in clinical trials, it uses an ontology of drug types and specific drugs. It queries the Ontology Server to help determine if drug-related eligibility criteria are met <ref> (Gennari, Oliver, Pratt, Rice, & Musen, 1995) </ref>. The SHADE project is addressing many information system interoperability issues. The Ontology Server has been used to define several large ontologies for satellite image metadata (e.g., for the Federal Geospatial Metadata Standard, the Terramar satellite image database).

Reference-contexts: The network interface supports queries (e.g., is zidovudine an antiretroviral-drug) as well as updates (e.g., create a subclass of vector-quantity called 3d-vector-quantity). Third, a user can translate an ontology into a format used by a specific application <ref> (Gruber, 1993) </ref> . The resulting translation can be used in a number of ways. For example, a CLIPS translation produces a set of class definitions and inference rules that can run directly in a CLIPS-based application.

Reference-contexts: The editor provides a number of features to support collaborative work (e.g., notifications, comparison, shared change logs). Second, remote applications may query and modify ontologies stored at the server over the Internet. These programmatic interactions use a network API that extends the Generic Frame Protocol <ref> (Karp, Myers, & Gruber, 1995) </ref> with a network interface. The network interface supports queries (e.g., is zidovudine an antiretroviral-drug) as well as updates (e.g., create a subclass of vector-quantity called 3d-vector-quantity). Third, a user can translate an ontology into a format used by a specific application (Gruber, 1993) .

Reference-contexts: The easiest and simplest approach is to provide no explicit support for modularizing represented knowledge let the author beware. For instance, the THEO system <ref> (Mitchell et al., 1989) </ref> uses a single knowledge base and a single set of axioms. In some sense, this enables Examples 1-3 to be represented, but it has two key drawbacks: First, it is impossible to restrict definitions (Example 4).
