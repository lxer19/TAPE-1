Title: Generalizing Halfspaces A closed set with nonempty interior and convex boundary is a halfspace The
Author: Eugene Fink Derick Wood 
Note: Every halfspace is convex  
Abstract: Restricted-orientation convexity is the study of geometric objects whose intersection with lines from some fixed set is empty or connected. We have studied the properties of restricted-orientation convex sets and demonstrated that this notion is a generalization of standard convexity. We now describe a restricted-orientation generalization of halfspaces and explore properties of these generalized halfspaces. In particular, we establish analogs of the following properties of standard halfspaces: * The intersection of a halfspace with every line is empty, a ray, or a line

Rawlins introduced the notion of restricted-orientation convexity, also called O-convexity, in his doctoral thesis, as a generalization of standard convexity [9].

Reference-contexts: We should give a word of warning. The results are not completely unexpected, yet their proofs are often surprisingly hard [3]; intuition serves us badly. We present the proofs in the full paper <ref> [2] </ref>. 2 Planar O-convexity and O-halfplanes We begin by reviewing the notion of O-convexity in two dimensions [9] and defining an O-convexity analog of halfplanes. <p> We show examples of O-halfplanes in Figures 1 (e)(g). Note that the empty set and the whole plane are considered O-halfplanes. This convention simplifies some of the results. We now give basic properties of O-halfplanes, which readily follow from the definition <ref> [2] </ref>: 1. Every translation of an O-halfplane is an O-halfplane. 2. Every standard halfplane is an O-halfplane. 3. (Convexity) Every O-halfplane is O-convex. 4. If an orientation set O contains two lines, then an O-halfplane is either connected or consists of two connected components. 5. <p> We assume that no plane contains all elements of O; that is, the elements of O are not coplanar. This assumption is essential for most of the results <ref> [3, 2] </ref>. Definition 2 (Orientation set and O-lines) An orientation set O in three dimensions is a nonempty set of lines through a fixed point o such that no plane contains all these lines. <p> The work we have presented here extends our previous study of O-convex sets [3]. In the full paper <ref> [2] </ref>, we demonstrate that the results hold not only in three dimensions but also in higher dimensions. The work leaves some open research problems, which we are currently trying to address. For example, we have not established the contractability of O-halfspaces. We conjecture that every connected O-halfspace is contractable.

Reference-contexts: Research on nontraditional convexities has so far been limited to two dimensions. The purpose of our work is to study nontraditional convexities in three dimensions. We demonstrated that restricted-orientation convexity can be extended to three dimensions and described major properties of this extension <ref> [3] </ref>. We now present a restricted-orientation generalization of halfspaces, explore properties of these generalized halfspaces, and describe their relation to O-convex sets. <p> We conjecture that most of the results also hold for nonclosed sets; however, some of our proofs work only for closed sets.
