Reference-contexts: Another goal of measuring plasma electrical parameters is to reconstruct the physical plasma quantities from these electrical measurements. Many researchers <ref> [1, 7-13] </ref> have proposed models relating the plasma physics to observed impedance. Although varying in the specifics, most agree that the plasma sheath can be represented by a capacitor, and the rate of dissociation of electrons from atoms as a resistor.

Reference-contexts: It is clear that whatever challenge exists in measuring the plasma electrical state at 13:56MHz , it is exacerbated at higher harmonics of this frequency. Numerous efforts to measure plasma electrical parameters have been published <ref> [3, 12, 15-20] </ref> but for the most part they leave the reader with many unanswered questions. <p> We can correct the problem by creating a model of the network between the load reference plane and the probe's measurement point. This makes use of the relatively common de-embedding process described in <ref> [3, 13, 17, 19] </ref>. The approach is described in Section 3.5.3.

Reference-contexts: Changes in variables independant from power such as raising or lowering processing pressure affect the power delivered to the plasma. Clearly this motivates using the delivered power and not the generator power as the control input in plasma processing. This was done with good results by <ref> [5, 6] </ref>, both using commercially available RF probes. Clearly, controlling the delivered power (as opposed to power output by the generator) requires determining delivered power with enough accuracy such that using measured delivered power as a feedback variable actually improves per 2 formance. <p> Most unnerving, a close reading of published data suggests disturbingly inconsistent results. Here at the University, we tried to reproduce the results in [20] with little or no success, despite using equipment identical to the published results. Zau <ref> [5] </ref> shows a plot of the same power measured by two different probes, one commercial, the other custom built. As noted by Zau, the results show absolutely no correlation. Shan [13] presents an equivalent circuit of the network between the probe and plasma.

Shan <ref> [13] </ref> presents an equivalent circuit of the network between the probe and plasma.

Reference-contexts: It has long been known that the plasma acts as a non linear load, rectifying the input frequency and resulting in a DC offset and harmonics of the fundamental frequency. Recently, Klick <ref> [14] </ref> has proposed a model for interpreting these higher harmonics as additional indicators of the plasma's physical state. It is clear that whatever challenge exists in measuring the plasma electrical state at 13:56MHz , it is exacerbated at higher harmonics of this frequency. <p> Preliminary research indicates that several commercial RF sensors do not offer sufficient accuracy for our purposes. Our long term goal is to develop a non intrusive plasma parameter estimator similar to that proposed by Michael Klick of the Adolf Slaby Institute (ASI) <ref> [14] </ref>. The 'Hercules' sensor developed by ASI claims to measure ion energy, ion flux and electron concentration by means of a wall mounted sensor. These are extremely important quantities for plasma processing and to date have only been obtainable in non processing conditions.
