Abstract: In the past few years, there has been significant progress in our understanding of the extent to which near-optimal solutions can be efficiently computed for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. This paper surveys these recent developments, while concentrating on the advances made in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms, and in particular, on those results that rely on linear programming and its generalizations. In the past few years, there have been major advances in our understanding of performance guarantees for approximation algorithms for NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Most notably, after twenty-five years of essentially no progress, a new technique has been developed for proving that certain approximation algorithms are unlikely to exist. Partially in response to this development, there have also been significant recent advances in the design and analysis of approximation algorithms. In this survey, we will outline a few of the areas in which progress has been made, and suggest directions in which there is still interesting work to be done. The central definition of this survey is that of a -approximation algorithm for an optimization problem: a polynomial-time algorithm that delivers a feasible solution of objective function value within a factor of of optimal. The study of approximation algorithms predates the theory of NP-completeness. Some early results, such as the proof due to Vizing (1964) that a graph always has

Prior to the work of Goemans & Williamson <ref> (1994) </ref>, no approximation algorithm with a performance guarantee superior to that for the general case was known.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the theorem of Arora, Lund, Motwani, Sudan, & Szegedy can be stated: NP=PCP (log n; 1). Due to its special properties, such a proof that x 2 L has sometimes been called a holographic proof. Feige, Goldwasser, Lovasz, Safra, & Szegedy <ref> (1991) </ref> observed an interesting connection between complexity class characterizations of this sort and approximation algorithms. <p> Although the result of Arora et al. for the Max 3-Sat problem is of great importance in and of itself, the consequences of this work are greatly magnified in conjunction with earlier work of Papadimitriou & Yannakakis <ref> (1991) </ref>. <p> In the remainder of this section, we briefly sketch the main components of the framework proposed by Papadimitriou & Yannakakis <ref> (1991) </ref>. The first element is the notion of reducibility from problem 1 to 2 ; here we wish to define a notion 6 DAVID B. SHMOYS that allows us to conclude that if 1 does not have a polynomial approximation scheme, then neither does 2 . <p> Finally, a problem is MAXSNP-complete if it is in MAXSNP and it is MAXSNP-hard. COMPUTING NEAR-OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS 7 It is not hard to show that the Max 3-Sat problem is in MAXSNP 0 , and hence in MAXSNP. Papadimitriou & Yannakakis <ref> (1991) </ref> showed that it is also complete. There is now a respectably long list of problems known to be MAXSNP-hard. <p> Papadimitriou & Yannakakis <ref> (1991) </ref> showed that the vertex cover problem is MAXSNP-hard, even if each weight is 1 and the degree of each vertex is bounded by a constant k. <p> Du & Hwang (1990) recently proved this conjecture. Hwang (1976) showed that for rectilinear distances in the plane, this ratio is always at most 3/2. When analyzed in these restricted metrics, Zelikovsky's algorithm can be shown to improve on known results in both cases. Du, Zhang, & Feng <ref> (1991) </ref> showed that this algorithm is a -approximation algorithm with &lt; 2= p 3 for Euclidean case, but did not give an explicit value for . Zelikovsky and Berman & Ramaiyer (1992) independently showed that it is an 11=8-approximation algorithm for the rectilinear case. <p> Now we wish to decide if there is an assignment of length T and total cost C. Similar rounding procedures for this problem were given independently by Trick <ref> (1991) </ref> and Lin & Vitter (1992). <p> The idea of using a primal-dual approach in this context was introduced by Agrawal, Klein, and Ravi <ref> (1991) </ref>, who gave a 2 log r max -approximation algorithm for the same problem, but where the connectivity requirements need not be of the restricted form. The algorithm uses scaling techniques to satisfy one bit of the connectivity requirements at a time. <p> Yue <ref> (1991) </ref> has subsequently claimed that F F D (I) (11=9)OP T BP (I) + 1, which, incidentally, implies that it is a 3/2-approximation algorithm. Thus, significantly stronger results can be obtained by relaxing the notion of the performance guarantee to allow for small additive terms. <p> By repeatedly applying this technique, we get the claimed result. This was the state of the art prior to the work of Feige, Goldwasser, Lovasz, Safra, & Szegedy <ref> (1991) </ref>, who scaled down the characterization of NEXP of Babai, Fortnow, & Lund (1991) to show that the maximum clique problem does not have a 2-approximation algorithm (and hence a polynomial approximation scheme) unless NPDTIME (n O (log log n) ). <p> By repeatedly applying this technique, we get the claimed result. This was the state of the art prior to the work of Feige, Goldwasser, Lovasz, Safra, & Szegedy <ref> (1991) </ref>, who scaled down the characterization of NEXP of Babai, Fortnow, & Lund (1991) to show that the maximum clique problem does not have a 2-approximation algorithm (and hence a polynomial approximation scheme) unless NPDTIME (n O (log log n) ). Arora & Safra (1992) strengthened this theorem to rely on the assumption P6=NP. <p> There has been little subsequent improvement: after considerable effort, the best performance guarantee currently known is only O (n (log log n) 2 =(log n) 3 ) (Halldorsson, 1993). For 3-colorable graphs, Blum <ref> (1991) </ref> improved Wigderson's algorithm, and gave a quite complicated algorithm that uses "only" O (n 3=8 polylogn) colors.
