Reference: [1] <author> Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman. </author> <title> Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. </title> <publisher> The MIT Press, </publisher> <address> Cambridge, Mass., </address> <year> 1985. </year>
Reference-contexts: This context helps students to see what computers are good for, and to see more of what being a computing professional is like. Abelson and Sussman's classic book is a good example of such an approach <ref> [1] </ref>. Properly done, a survey course or a first programming course will motivate and interest students, and give them the background they need for further study. <p> The readings are divided by topic. In addition to the literature discussed below, I also recommend books about the specific programming language used in class, which is Scheme <ref> [7, 1, 5, 2, 6] </ref>. These books also contain many interesting programming ideas. I also recommend books about the operating system and editor that the students use, although there is little need to discuss those books here.

Reference-contexts: do much reading outside class; nevertheless, they may turn to it in the summer or in later years. (Thus it is important that remarks about the list be included with the list itself.) However, for a few students, even this approach will be very helpful; these students are global learners <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, who have difficulty learning a subject if they do not see its context and motivation. By passing out a list of introductory readings, one gives global learners some of the tools they need to succeed.

Reference-contexts: One way to guide students to the intellectual heart of computing, and thus indirectly guide their reading, is to survey computing as a whole in the first class in the curriculum [9] <ref> [8] </ref> [10]. However, there are many, myself included, who do not favor such an approach. So for various reasons, many schools will still be teaching a first course in computing which is largely a programming course.

Finally, if the course is not a survey of computing, it is good to recommend such a book, for example <ref> [10] </ref>. If nothing else, such a book will be an aid to global learners. I also recommend that students may want to read books about science or some other science in general to get more perspective.
