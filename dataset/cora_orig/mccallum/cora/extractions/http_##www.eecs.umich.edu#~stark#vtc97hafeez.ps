Abstract: In this paper, we consider several multiuser demodulation schemes for a direct-sequence code-division multiple access (DS-CDMA) system that provide soft-outputs to enhance single-user soft-decision decoders. First, we derive an optimum soft-output multiuser estimation (OSOME) algorithm for asynchronous CDMA channels with white Gaussian noise (WGN). The algorithm generates a posteriori probabilities (APP) for coded bits given the received signal. This forward-recursive algorithm requires complexity and storage exponential in the number of users K and linear in the decision lag L. Second, we outline a reduced-computation suboptimal version of this algorithm (SSOME) which compares favorably in complexity and storage with multiuser soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA). Furthermore, we note that the Bayesian conditional decision feedback estimation (BCDFE) algorithm [3] provides symbol APP estimates that can be considerably improved upon by a slight modification. We derive the modified BCDFE algorithm for whitened multiuser channels. Finally, we present simulation results of a 4-user, convolutionally coded, asynchronous CDMA system. The results indicate that the SSOME algorithm with L = K 1 achieves a 0:4 0:5 dB gain over SOVA with much greater lag (and complexity) and keeps within 0:25 dB of the OSOME algorithm. Moreover, the modified BCDFE algorithm provides a good performance/complexity tradeoff.

The recursion in the OSOME algorithm can be reduced to add-compare-select operations only. The resulting suboptimal version called SSOME has a recursion similar to the sub-optimum soft-output algorithm (SSA) of <ref> [1] </ref> but differs in the way symbol APP's are generated. Bayesian Conditional Decision Feedback Estimation (BCDFE) proposed in [3] for ISI channels is a reduced-complexity symbol-by-symbol estimation scheme that employs an efficient method of trellis truncation. <p> : : ; u M g, approximate symbol APP's as: p (b nL = bjr n (t)) = n exp [m L ( n ; b; y n )] n ;b exp [m L ( n ; b; y n )] The above recursion is similar to that of SSA <ref> [1] </ref>, except the latter estimates symbol APP's by: p (b nL = bjr n (t)) = n ; b; y n )] b exp [m L ( fl where fl n = argmax m ( n ;y n ) .
