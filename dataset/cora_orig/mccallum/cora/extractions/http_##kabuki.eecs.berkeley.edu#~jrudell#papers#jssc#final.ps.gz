Abstract: A new architecture for digital implementation of the adapti ve equalizer in Class IV P artial Response Maximum Likelihood (PRML) channels employing parallelism and pipelining is described. The architecture was used in a prototype inte grated circuit in a 1.2 mm CMOS technology to implement an 8-tap adaptive equalizer and Viterbi sequence detector which consumes a total of 70 mW from a 3.3 V supply operating at an input sampling rate of 50 MHz.

Reference-contexts: For example, the power dissipation of the CMOS logic alone in a recently reported BiC- MOS 65 Mbits/sec read channel IC implementing digital equalization, sequence detection, and other associated functions was 1 W <ref> [3] </ref>. Powerful battery operated portable personal computers are becoming increasingly prevalent and the performance requirements of the storage de vices in these systems continually increases.

Reference-contexts: the current practice was made possible through the use of an optimum mixture of parallelism and pipelining, which in turn allowed the use of a 3.3 V supply while meeting the throughput requirements. 2.0 Low Power Adaptive Equalizer Architecture and Design As has been recently demonstrated in other w ork <ref> [4] </ref>, major reductions in po wer dissipation in such digital functions are possible through the use of lo wer power supply voltages, since the power consumed by a CMOS digital circuit is proportional to CV 2 f.

Reference-contexts: This small word width has major implications for the minimization of power through the use of parallelism, since multipliers for this width are relati vely compact. Extensive simulations were performed to explore various permutations of parallelism and pipelining in the implementation of a conventional multiplier <ref> [5] </ref> for filter sampling rates above 50 MHz and a power supply of 3.3 V. <p> Further optimization can occur with appropriate design choices at the circuit level. The multipliers were constructed using the Baugh-Wooley twos compliment parallel array algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>. The benefits of two logic styles, complimentary pass logic and static CMOS, were combined to implement the full adders as sho wn in Figure 4.
