Abstract: Mobile workers need seamless access to communication and information services on portable devices. However current solutions overwhelm users with intrusive and ambiguous notifications. In this paper, we describe scaleable auditory techniques and a contextual notification model for providing timely information, while minimizing interruptions. Users actions influence local adaptation in the model. These techniques are demonstrated in Nomadic Radio, an audio-only wearable computing platform.

Reference-contexts: As messages arrive the system plots the notification level on graphs depicting priority vs. usage level and priority vs. conversation level. The graph is similar to the dynamic Starfield displays used in interactive visual querying applications <ref> [1] </ref>. When no messages are shown, the graph display predicts notification levels as slopes based on the two graph axis. The messages on the top are higher priority, whereas ones on the lowest slope indicate lower priority group messages.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we will consider techniques for scaleable auditory presentation and an appropriate parameterized approach towards contextual notification . Several recent projects have utilized speech and audio I/O on wearable devices to present information. A prototype augmented audio tour guide <ref> [2] </ref> presented digital audio recordings indexed by the spatial location of visitors in a museum. SpeechWear [12] enabled users to perform data entry and retrieval using speech recognition and synthesis.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the probabilities are weighted, such that most recent time periods in the window are considered more relevant for computing the overall Speech Level. The techniques for feature extraction and classification of the auditory scene using HMMs (Hidden Markov Models) are described in a recent workshop paper <ref> [3] </ref>. The classifiers performance is currently being refined and we are integrating this module in Nomadic Radio. Notification Level A weighted average for all three contextual cues provides an overall notification level (Notify Level ).

Reference-contexts: The various auditory cues (as many as 12 sounds play simultaneously) merged as an auditory texture allowed people to hear the plant as a complex integrated process. Background sounds were also explored in ShareMon <ref> [4] </ref>, a prototype application that notified users of file sharing activity. Cohen found that pink noise used to indicate %CPU time was considered obnoxious, even though users understood the pitch correlation. However, preliminary reactions to wave sounds were 4 considered positive and even soothing.

Reference-contexts: New users choose not to adopt such technologies, having observed the obvious problems encountered with their usage. In addition, current users tend to turn off the devices in many situations, inhibiting the optimal operation of such personal devices. Nature of Interruptions in the Workplace A recent observational study <ref> [5] </ref> evaluated the effect of interruptions on the activity of mobile professionals in their workplace. An interruption, defined as asynchronous and unscheduled interactions, not initiated by the user, results in the recipient discontinuing the current activity. The results revealed several key issues.

Reference-contexts: Such peripheral awareness minimizes cognitive overhead of monitoring incoming messages relative to notifications played as distinct auditory cues which incur a somewhat higher cost of attention on part of the listener. Related Work in Auditory Awareness In ARKola <ref> [6] </ref>, an audio/visual simulation of a bottling factory, repetitive streams of sounds allowed people to keep track of activity, rate, and functioning of running machines. Without sounds people often overlooked problems; with auditory cues, problems were indicated by the machine's sound ceasing (often ineffective) or via distinct alert sounds.

Reference-contexts: A linear and scaleable auditory notification model is utilized, based on the notion of estimating costs of interruption and the value of information to be delivered to the user. This approach is similar to recent work <ref> [7] </ref> on using perceptual costs and a focus of attention model for scaleable graphics rendering. Message Priority The priority of incoming messages is explicitly determined via content-based email filtering using CLUES [10], a filtering and prioritization system.

Reference-contexts: Mode transitions - switching categories, going to non-speech or ambient mode. 3. Exceptional conditions - message not found, lost connection with servers, and errors. Priority Cues for Notification In a related project, "email glances" <ref> [8] </ref> were formulated as a stream of short sounds indicating category, sender and content flags (from keywords in the message). In Nomadic Radio, message priority inferred from email content filtering provides distinct auditory cues (assigned by the user) for group, personal, timely, and important messages.

Reference-contexts: Currently the users actions primarily adjust weights for subsequent messages, however effective reinforcement learning requires a model that generalizes a notification policy that maximizes some long-term measure of reinforcement <ref> [9] </ref>; this will be the focus of our future work. Tuning Notifications via Interactive Visualization As we have shown, the success of the notification strategy relies on the initial weights selected for the contextual cues. Varying sets of weighting schemes can be used to provide low, medium or high interruption.

Reference-contexts: This approach is similar to recent work [7] on using perceptual costs and a focus of attention model for scaleable graphics rendering. Message Priority The priority of incoming messages is explicitly determined via content-based email filtering using CLUES <ref> [10] </ref>, a filtering and prioritization system. CLUES has been integrated in Nomadic Radio to determine the timely nature of messages by finding correlation between a user's calendar, rolodex, to-do list, as well as a record of outgoing messages and phone calls.

In a recent paper [14], researchers suggest the use of sensors and user modeling to allow wearables to infer when users should be interrupted by incoming messages. <p> Cohen found that pink noise used to indicate %CPU time was considered obnoxious, even though users understood the pitch correlation. However, preliminary reactions to wave sounds were 4 considered positive and even soothing. In Audio Aura <ref> [11] </ref>, alarm sounds were eliminated and a number of harmonically coherent sonic ecologies" were explored, mapping events to auditory, musical or voice-based feedback. Such techniques were used to passively convey the number of email messages received, identity of senders, and abstract representations of group activity.
