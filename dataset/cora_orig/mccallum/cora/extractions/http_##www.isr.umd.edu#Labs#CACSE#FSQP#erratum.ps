Abstract: An error is pointed out in the local convergence proof in the quoted paper [SIAM J. Optimization 6(1996), 461]. A correct proof is given. The proof of Lemma 3.14 in [2] is incorrect. Namely, proving the claim in the second sentence of the proof does not "complete the proof" as stated. To see this, note that the mathematical induction argument hinted at in that sentence merely proves that, for the infinite index set K whose existence is established by Lemma 3.12, given any integer i, there exists k i such that max (x fl ) b Nevertheless, the convergence results claimed in that section of [2] do hold true. A correct proof is obtained if Lemmas 3.13, 3.14, and 3.15 in [2] are replaced with Lemmas 3.13', 3.14', and 3.15' given below. (The statements of Lemmas 3.14' and 3.15' are identical to those of Lemmas 3.14 and 3.15, respectively, but the proofs are different.) The implicit assumptions required for the original Lemmas 3.13-3.15 are still assumed to hold.

Proof. Given x with kx x fl k &lt; ffi, H 2 H, and ^ with max (x fl ) ^ , let d(x; H; ^ ) be the unique KKT point of QP (x; H; ^ ). Then Lemma 3.2 implies that d(x fl ; H; ^ ) = 0 for all H 2 H. Since H is compact, in view of Assumptions 4 and 5, it follows from a classical result of Robinson's [1, Theorem 2.1] that, given
