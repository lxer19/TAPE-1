Abstract: The Human-Computer Interaction Lab worked with a team for the Library of Congress (LC) to develop and test interface designs for LCs National Digital Library Program. Three iterations are described and illustrate the progression of the project toward a compact design that minimizes scrolling and jumping and anchors users in a screen space that tightly couples search and results. Issues and resolutions are discussed for each iteration and reflect the challenges of incomplete metadata, data visualization, and the rapidly changing web environment.

Reference-contexts: The needs assessment report presents a user typology with nine type/task components and identifies a series of interface challenges broken into content and user strategies categories <ref> [1] </ref>. During the January-August, 1996 period, a prototype interface evolved over several iterations. The evolution of this prototype is the subject of this design briefing.

Reference-contexts: HCIL has collaborated successfully with LC in the past, most recently on the LC ACCESS interface-a graphical, touch-panel design that is used in the Librarys Main Reading Room <ref> [2] </ref>. The current project goal was to foster a user-centered design team similar to the ACCESS team.

Reference-contexts: The current project goal was to foster a user-centered design team similar to the ACCESS team. HCIL has focused considerable effort on interfaces that allow users to browse and search collections of information and has been developing interface techniques such as dynamic queries <ref> [3] </ref>, visual information seeking [4] and query previews [5-6]. Dynamic query interfaces extend direct manipulation to search tasks by closely coupling search specification with the display of results.

Reference-contexts: JavaScript and dynamic GIFs were not yet available. The only clientside technologies that were sufficiently mature and available were Java and Shockwave/Director. HCIL chose Java because we had already started to work on a similar dynamic query interface for our NASA's EOSDIS project <ref> [5] </ref>. Graphic overview Previously, starfield displays had been used to display "point" data, where database objects assume discrete values on each axis of the scatterplot. But few of the collection attributes could be represented as a single discrete value.
