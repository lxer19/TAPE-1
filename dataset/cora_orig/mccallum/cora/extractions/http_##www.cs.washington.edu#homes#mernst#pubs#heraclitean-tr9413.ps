Reference-contexts: To keep the example small, we will use only five bits of information from the user name. For user "U", this information is the binary number 10101, as U is the 21st letter. To error-correcting code 10101, we use the standard Hamming code <ref> [Ham50; VvO89, pp. 65-69] </ref> for 5 "beef" bits; there are 4 check bits. The matrix is 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 where the columns containing a single "1" are the check bits.

Reference-contexts: It can be used whenever the rightful recipients of broadcasted encrypted information have less incentive to keep it secret than the sender but do not want to be seen to be publicly distributing the information. Her-aclitean encryption can also be used to trace unintentional leaks. The Greek philosopher Heraclitus <ref> [Her] </ref> noted that, because a river constantly changes, no one can step into the same river twice: You could not step twice into the same rivers; For other waters are ever flowing onto you.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the elliptic curve method <ref> [KMOV91] </ref> can be substituted for RSA. Its chief advantage over RSA is that elliptic curve systems are more secure for the same key length, or just as secure with shorter, easier-to-communicate keys [Men93].

Reference-contexts: Revealing xy also permits a to be determined from E (a), so x should be uniquely determinable from xy, not just for the issuer of x and y, but for anyone. 3 We accomplish this by encoding the identifying information id in x using a Godel encoding <ref> [LP81] </ref> followed by an error-correcting coding (ECC). Our Godel numbering associates with each string a number in Z (n) with no large factors.

Heraclitean encryption does not address tracing leaked information; it is a feature of Heraclitean encryption that each decryption produces the same result from a particular codetext, even though the decryption keys differ.

Reference-contexts: We call our scheme Heraclitean because its goal is to prevent any two distinct decryption keys from sharing any information. 2 Tying keys to users For concreteness, our examples use the RSA cryptosystem <ref> [RSA78] </ref>. Let n = pq, where p and q are prime, and choose e and d such that ed mod (n) = 1, where is Euler's totient function. In this case, (n) = (p 1)(q 1).
