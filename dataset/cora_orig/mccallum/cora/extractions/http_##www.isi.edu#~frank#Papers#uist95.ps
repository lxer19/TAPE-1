Abstract: Grizzly Bear is a new demonstrational tool for specifying user interface behavior. It can handle multiple application windows, dynamic object instantiation and deletion, changes to any object attribute, and operations on sets of objects. It enables designers to experiment with rubber banding, deletion by dragging to a trashcan and many other interactive techniques. To the author s best knowledge it is currently the most complete demonstrational user interface design tool that does not base its inferencing on rule-based guessing. There are inherent limitations to the range of user interfaces that can ever be built by demonstration alone. Grizzly Bear is therefore designed to work hand-in-hand with a user interface specification language called the Elements, Events & Transitions model. As designers demonstrate behavior , they can watch Grizzly Bear incrementally build the corresponding textual specification, letting them learn the language on the fly. They can then apply their knowledge by modifying Grizzly Bears textual inferences, which reduces the need for repetitive demonstrations and provides an escape mechanism for behavior that cannot be demonstrated.

Reference-contexts: The use of Grizzly Bear is best explained by examples. The rest of this paper shows how to build a small file manager application which lets users create and delete documents and folders. Figure 2 shows its user interface, which is laid out using a conventional user interface builder <ref> [3] </ref>. The behavior to be demonstrated is that new folders and documents can be created on the main canvas by dragging from their prototypes. They can then be moved around, and they can be deleted by dragging them to the trashcan. We will discuss creation by dragging in detail.
