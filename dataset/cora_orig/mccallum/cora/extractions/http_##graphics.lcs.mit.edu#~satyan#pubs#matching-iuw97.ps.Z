Abstract: This paper describes novel algorithms that use absolute camera pose information to identify correspondence among point features in hundreds or thousands of images. Our incidence counting algorithm is a geometric approach to matching; it matches features by extruding them into an absolute 3-D coordinate system, then searching 3-D space for regions into which many features project. The absolute pose estimates reported by our instrumentation are accurate, but not perfect. Thus, we also consider the problem of refining these pose estimates, given feature matches from a set of images. We describe a pose refinement algorithm which decouples translation (position) estimates from rotation (attitude) estimates, and can incorporate matches from many hundreds or thousands of images.

While these techniques work well for images taken from nearby camera positions, they are less effective for disparate images taken from cameras that are far from each other.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we design a matching algorithm that uses camera pose estimates (provided by physical instrumentation) to over-constrain the matching problem, identifying matches by applying geometric constraints imposed by the camera positions. In some ways, our algorithm is similar to use of the epipolar constraint in stereo vision <ref> [ Faugeras, 1993 ] </ref> , but generalizes that method in its incorporation of many cameras and images.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many 3-D reconstruction algorithms rely on a matching or correspondence step to identify constraints corresponding to the scene geometry; these constraints are used to guide the 3-D reconstruction process. Typically, matching is performed using some image attribute (e.g., pixel luminance <ref> [ Gennery, 1977 ] </ref> ) or some geometric attribute (e.g., length and orientation of fl Funding for this research was provided in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of the Defense under Office of Naval Research contract N00014-92-J-1310. edges [ Ayache, 1991 ] ).

Reference-contexts: A variety of representations are in use: orthonormal matrices, quater-nions, Euler angles, etc. [ Foley et al., 1990 ] . Each of these representations has its own advantages and disadvantages; the most appropriate representation depends on the application (e.g., quaternions provide closed form solutions for absolute orientation <ref> [ Horn, 1987 ] </ref> ). 3 The solution is valid only up to a rigid (rotation, translation, uniform scaling) transformation. The "correct" transformation can be obtained by fixing the values of some three points in absolute coordinates.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, rays constructed by extrusion exhibit the clustering property: while there are regions of high density (e.g., near features), there are large regions containing very few rays. We exploit this property by constructing an octree <ref> [ Samet, 1990 ] </ref> to store the rays.

Reference-contexts: This has the advantage that no additional constraints are needed to ensure rotational properties, in contrast to the orthonormality constraint for 3 fi 3 matrices or the unit length constraint for quaternions.
