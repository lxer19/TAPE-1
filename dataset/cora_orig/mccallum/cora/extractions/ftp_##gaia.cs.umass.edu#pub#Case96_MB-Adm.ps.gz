Abstract: The purpose of call admission control in Integrated Services Networks is to offer a guarantee that Quality of Service (QoS) bounds are not violated due to the admission of new calls into the network. This is typically accomplished using the declared worst-case traffic descriptors for incoming calls, a solution which results in poor bandwidth utilization. A measurement-based admission scheme is an appealing alternative: not only does it offer adaptivity to changing traffic conditions, it also allows statistical multiplexing gains to be exploited. In this paper, we examine the problem of determining which traffic characterization a measurement-based admission control algorithm should require of sources requesting access. Building on the work of [1], we also propose an adaptive measurement-based admission control algorithm that simplifies the estimation process. We test the new algorithm under different traffic scenarios and show that it can achieve a high level of utilization without violating its delay-based QoS guarantees. We also compare the performance of our adaptive-window algorithm with the fixed-window algorithm described in [1].

With predictive service (as well as with other service classes, such as the so-called controlled-load service class [22]), measurements of ongoing admitted calls are used together with the declared traffic parameters of a call seeking admission to the network in making the call acceptance/rejection decision. <p> In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new measurement-based admission control algorithm. Our work extends existing work on measurement-based admission control <ref> [2, 1] </ref> in three important directions: * We examine the question of how best (from an admission control standpoint) to characterize a source among several equivalent leaky bucket source characterizations. <p> Our study is chiefly conducted through simulation. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we provide a brief overview of past work in the area of measurement-based admission control, and summarize the specific algorithm proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>, tailoring the description to the simple network setting we consider. Section 3 addresses the issues of source 2 characterization and suggests that measuring sources' rates, rather than their packet delays, may be a better choice for a measurement-based admission control process. <p> Measurement-based admission control for predictive service in Integrated Services Packet Networks was first introduced in [2] and then further developed in <ref> [1] </ref>, where a delay and rate measurement scheme for predictive service was proposed. As our work builds on [1], we next describe the admission scheme proposed in that paper.

The interested reader is referred to [1] for further details. Since our extensions will be considered in the context of a simpler network model than the one considered in [1], we first describe our network model. 2.1 Network Model We consider the network scenario shown in Fig. 1, consisting of a link of capacity connecting two switches. Each switch is assumed to have an infinite buffer, so that packet loss probability is not a factor in our study. <p> We note that with the choice of the parameters above, a network without any admission control mechanism would achieve a near 100 % utilization. 2.3 The Admission Algorithm We now describe the measurement-based admission algorithm proposed in <ref> [1] </ref>, in the context of the simple network scenario described above. The key to the admission process is that the new call (or flow of data) should be accepted only if: * the current traffic conditions at the switch can `guarantee' that the call receives the QoS it requests. <p> As we will see, as a result of the measurement process, at any given time the call admission algorithm will have an estimate of these two quantities, D and -. Given these estimates, an arriving call is granted admission if the following two conditions hold <ref> [1] </ref>: 1. Given a current delay estimate, D; a new delay estimate, D; 0 is formed such that D 0 = D + : Note that is the amount of time to transmit a full token bucket's worth of data from the new call. <p> In the simplest case, at the end of a measurement window, an estimate is updated to be the highest observed value of that measure during the measurement window. In certain cases, however, the measurement window will be terminated prematurely and the estimates updated in a different manner. Specifically <ref> [1] </ref>: * When a new call is admitted, the delay and rate estimates are updated using equations (1) and (2). <p> The factor allows us to be more conservative by overestimating the quantity, resulting in more conservative admission control when the measure is close to the bound. In <ref> [1] </ref> it is suggested that = 2 be used for delay and = 1 for rate estimates. We will use these values. In our fluid-flow simulation model, a single, `instantaneous' delay measurement is computed by dividing the switch queue length at that time by the queue's service rate . <p> Since there is no such thing as an `instantaneous' rate measure, a small interval S is specified and a rate measurement is taken as the number of bits transmitted on the link during this interval. <ref> [1] </ref> suggests using S = 500 ms. It should be pointed out that the quality of the call admission scheme [1] is highly dependent on the values of the so-called 'performance tuning knobs' (target utilization, , length of the measurement window). <p> thing as an `instantaneous' rate measure, a small interval S is specified and a rate measurement is taken as the number of bits transmitted on the link during this interval. <ref> [1] </ref> suggests using S = 500 ms. It should be pointed out that the quality of the call admission scheme [1] is highly dependent on the values of the so-called 'performance tuning knobs' (target utilization, , length of the measurement window). Selection of these values is an open problem which goes beyond the simple task of fine tuning the behavior of the admission scheme. <p> Arguably, the most challenging issue is finding the `right' length of the measurement window, since the performance of the admission scheme heavily relies on it. As noted in <ref> [1] </ref>, too short a window lowers the admission threshold as soon as the traffic thins out, leaving the network dangerously exposed to bursts. <p> By virtue of this choice, we are not committed to any packet size. However, tokens are representative of whole data units like cells and packets. We assume that a token is equivalent to a 1 kb data unit (as in <ref> [1] </ref>). Following [20], we consider bufferless leaky-bucket-constrained Markov-modulated On/Off fluid sources with parameters (; ): But what values of (; ) should be chosen? In [1], it is suggested that (; ) pairs be chosen empirically as the smallest and that result in the desired loss rate at the token bucket. <p> We assume that a token is equivalent to a 1 kb data unit (as in <ref> [1] </ref>).

In [1], it is suggested that (; ) pairs be chosen empirically as the smallest and that result in the desired loss rate at the token bucket. Of course, such strategy cannot be employed if the traffic characteristics of the ON/OFF sources have not been evaluated in advance. <p> The idea behind the first-level algorithm is quite simple. The algorithm continually shrinks the length of the measurement window (resulting in admission control decisions that work towards increasing link utilizations; 10 see Tables 1 and 2, and the discussion in <ref> [1] </ref>) until the amount of traffic generated by accepted calls reaches a trigger value.

We note that this also fits well with the IETF specification of the Controlled Load Service <ref> [22] </ref>, in that it does not make use of target values for such direct performance measures (e.g., delay or loss) but rather ensures that adequate bandwidth is available to handle the declared traffic rate. 4 A new measurement-based admission algorithm In the previous sections we have discussed several aspects of measurement-based <p> trigger value is actually a rate value, smaller than the output link capacity, providing an early warning that the system is about to reach a load level where it may be requested that some form of control be implemented (this does not necessarily mean that we are approaching overload, see <ref> [22] </ref>). The first-level algorithm then reacts by enlarging the measurement window until the measured rate drops below the trigger, at which point the window can be shrunk again.

Reference-contexts: The Hurst parameter (H ) is useful to determine the long-range dependence of a trace: values of H close to 1 indicate a high degree of LRD, whereas the absence of LRD is denoted by H = 0:5 (see <ref> [23] </ref>). Further details on the MPEG sequences used in this paper can be obtained from [24]. Since it would be unrealistic to transmit video traces over a 10 M b=s link, is increased to 155 M b=s, thus allowing a higher degree of statistical multiplexing.
