Modigliani. </author> <title> A Criterion to Decide the Semantic Matching Problem. </title> <booktitle> In Proceedings of the International Conference on Logic and Algebra (in memory of Prof. </booktitle> <address> Magari), Italy, </address> <year> 1995. </year>
Reference-contexts: Unlike our previous work on semantic matching [Dershowitz et al., 1992], here we use a purely syntactic property of depth. Those results were extended in <ref> [Aguzzi and Modigliani, 1994] </ref> to incorporate positional information. In [Christian, 1992] it is shown that narrowing (hence, inversion) terminates for terminating systems with all left-side variables at depth 2. Perhaps the algorithm given here can be extended in that direction.
