Title: A New Change of Variables for EYcient BRDF Representation

Abstract: We describe an idea for making decomposition of Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions into basis functions more eYcient, by performing a change-of-variables transformation on the BRDFs. In particular, we propose a reparameterization of the BRDF as a function of the halfangle (i.e. the angle halfway between the directions of incidence and reflection) and a diVerence angle instead of the usual parameterization in terms of angles of incidence and reflection. Because features in common BRDFs, including specular and retroreflective peaks, are aligned with the transformed coordinate axes, the change of basis reduces storage requirements for a large class of BRDFs. We present results derived from analytic BRDFs and measured data.

Reference-contexts: An ideal specular peak is represented as a delta function of h , and is completely independent of the other three variables. Similarly, a simple BRDF such as Blinn's variation <ref> [Blinn 77] </ref> on Phong's model [Phong 75] is also a function of only h . In general, any BRDF that depends only on (~n ~ h) is independent of three of the four variables in the transformed space.

Reference-contexts: Many of these formulas are the result of modeling the properties of a real surface and mathematically computing the amount of light that would be reflected by a surface with those properties. For example, physically-based BRDFs have been derived for primarily specular surfaces (e.g. the Cook-Torrance-Sparrow model <ref> [Cook 81] </ref>), for rough diVuse surfaces (the Oren-Nayar model [Oren 94]), and for dusty surfaces (the Hapke/Lommel-Seeliger model, developed to model lunar reflectance [Hapke 63]).

Reference-contexts: Lafortune's generalized cosine lobes [Lafortune 97] can represent a wide range of phenomena, including oV-specular reflection and retroreflection. As with all phenomenological models, however, there exist behaviors that Lafortune's functions cannot represent (including most commonly-seen kinds of anisotropy). Shade trees <ref> [Cook 84] </ref> and shading languages such as RenderMan [Hanrahan 90] attempt to generalize phenomenological models even further, by allowing simpler models to be combined in flexible ways. As we have seen, both physically-based and phenomenological models can only represent certain limited classes of surfaces.

Reference-contexts: For example, physically-based BRDFs have been derived for primarily specular surfaces (e.g. the Cook-Torrance-Sparrow model [Cook 81]), for rough diVuse surfaces (the Oren-Nayar model [Oren 94]), and for dusty surfaces (the Hapke/Lommel-Seeliger model, developed to model lunar reflectance <ref> [Hapke 63] </ref>). They range in complexity from simple formulas that ignore many real-world eVects to complex models that attempt to account for most actually-observed surface phenomena (e.g. the He-Torrance-Sillion-Greenberg model [He 91]).

Reference-contexts: They range in complexity from simple formulas that ignore many real-world eVects to complex models that attempt to account for most actually-observed surface phenomena (e.g. the He-Torrance-Sillion-Greenberg model <ref> [He 91] </ref>). Because they are derived from physical principles, these models, to a large degree, satisfy the criteria of physical plausibility, such as energy conservation and Helmholtz reciprocity.

Reference-contexts: Koenderink et al. explore this possibility, looking at representing BRDFs in terms of the Zernike polynomials, which form an orthonormal basis of functions on the unit disk <ref> [Koenderink 96] </ref>. The authors use an equal-area mapping from the disk onto the hemisphere, and enforce reciprocity by taking particular linear combinations of the functions. Thus, the paper develops a representation very similar to that used by Westin et al., but optimized for the hemisphere rather than the sphere.

Reference-contexts: Phenomenological models have been used successfully to widen the range of representable BRDFs. For example, the Minnaert BRDF [Minnaert 41] was an early empirical formula developed to characterize the reflectance of the moon before more physically-correct models were derived. Lafortune's generalized cosine lobes <ref> [Lafortune 97] </ref> can represent a wide range of phenomena, including oV-specular reflection and retroreflection. As with all phenomenological models, however, there exist behaviors that Lafortune's functions cannot represent (including most commonly-seen kinds of anisotropy).

Reference-contexts: Lalonde and Fournier describe a complete implementation, using wavelets on the Nusselt embedding of the hemisphere <ref> [Lalonde 97] </ref> and a tree-based encoding of the coeYcients. Their experience shows that, as expected, using wavelets results in significant BRDF compression. 3 Change of Variables Decomposition into basis functions is certainly a suitable technique when it is necessary to have the ability to represent arbitrary BRDFs.

Reference-contexts: As a result, even the most elaborate theoretical models cannot predict reflectance from surfaces with complex microstructure or mesostruc-ture (e.g. cloth, metallic paint, fur). Phenomenological models have been used successfully to widen the range of representable BRDFs. For example, the Minnaert BRDF <ref> [Minnaert 41] </ref> was an early empirical formula developed to characterize the reflectance of the moon before more physically-correct models were derived.

Reference-contexts: For example, physically-based BRDFs have been derived for primarily specular surfaces (e.g. the Cook-Torrance-Sparrow model [Cook 81]), for rough diVuse surfaces (the Oren-Nayar model <ref> [Oren 94] </ref>), and for dusty surfaces (the Hapke/Lommel-Seeliger model, developed to model lunar reflectance [Hapke 63]).

Reference-contexts: An ideal specular peak is represented as a delta function of h , and is completely independent of the other three variables. Similarly, a simple BRDF such as Blinn's variation [Blinn 77] on Phong's model <ref> [Phong 75] </ref> is also a function of only h . In general, any BRDF that depends only on (~n ~ h) is independent of three of the four variables in the transformed space.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the spatially-localized wavelets can represent the large spikes (e.g. the specular peak) of many common BRDFs more eYciently than spherical harmonics or Zernike polynomials. Schrder and Sweldens have proposed a basis of wavelets optimized for representing functions on a sphere <ref> [Schrder 95] </ref>, although they did not actually describe an implementation of storing complete BRDFs using these spherical wavelets. Lalonde and Fournier describe a complete implementation, using wavelets on the Nusselt embedding of the hemisphere [Lalonde 97] and a tree-based encoding of the coeYcients.

Reference-contexts: For example, Figure 4 shows the primarily retroreflective Hapke/Lommel-Seeliger BRDF. Finally, let us consider one particular kind of anisotropy, namely the anisotropy associated with BRDFs that have elliptical specular peaks. These are the kinds of BRDFs predicted by, for example, Ward's elliptical Gaussian BRDF <ref> [Ward 92] </ref>, and are commonly seen on surfaces such as brushed metals.

Reference-contexts: As we have seen, both physically-based and phenomenological models can only represent certain limited classes of surfaces. Given an arbitrary BRDF, whether it was measured directly or obtained through simulation (as in <ref> [Westin 92] </ref>), there is no guarantee that any analytic model can represent it. This often does not meet the requirements of computer graphics, since in general one would like to produce realistic renderings of arbitrary surfaces. <p> Westin et al. present an implementation of using spherical harmonics to represent BRDFs, taking advantage of symmetry and reciprocity in the BRDF to reduce storage requirements <ref> [Westin 92] </ref>. Full BRDF High-frequency components removed (Torrance-Sparrow) (Spherical harmonics through order 8 retained) The directions of incident light and ideal specular reflection are also shown.
