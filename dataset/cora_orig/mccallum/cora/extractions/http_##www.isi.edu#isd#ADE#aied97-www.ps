Abstract: A computer-based distance learning system should interact with students, adapt to the needs of individual students, support interaction with teachers and other students, and be easy to author. The Advanced Distance Education (ADE) project is developing specialized applications of World Wide Web technology in order to meet these objectives. ADE combines Web browsers and servers with intelligent course manage - ment software running on the students' computers. A major innovation of our approach is the use of pedagogical agents to monitor student interactions and provide guidance and advice. Pedagogical agents may offer advantages over conventional intelligent learning environments because they enable closer and more natural interactions between students and intelligent courseware. Such interaction is in sharp contrast with the static documents that one often finds in Web-based course materials. In addition, we are developing tools and methodologies that make it possible to create interactive agent-based courseware without specialized knowledge of artificial intelligence or Web programming.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The World Wide Web has attracted a great deal of attention as a vehicle for delivering distance courseware. Institutions with longstanding involvement in distance education, such as the Open University [Open University 1996] and Athabasca University <ref> [Athabasca University 1996] </ref> are incorporating Web-based elements. Other examples of Web-based courses include [ Bigelow 1996], [De Bra 1996], and [ Rakel 1997].

Reference-contexts: The oncology course is one of many courses on specialized topics that will be developed for general practice physicians. We are developing both problem-based learning (PBL) courses and traditional case-based courses. The problem-based learning model <ref> [Barrows 1997] </ref> has its roots in the apprenticeship, or learning-by-doing, method. It emphasizes a real-world approach to learning: a student-centered process that is both constructive and collaborative. In practice, PBL is difficult to implement, with or without computer-based support.

Reference-contexts: Brusilovsky and Weber's InterBook [Brusilovsky et al. 1996] supports adaptivity and authoring, but all adaptation and page generation takes place at the central server, risking access delays. QuestWriter <ref> [Bogley et al. 1996] </ref> supports authoring, and has built-in clientside and server side interactivity, but does not adapt presentations to individual students. The Advanced Distance Education project is developing tools to address each of the above concerns. Interactive courseware interacts with students in a timely fashion, avoiding unnecessary networking delays.

Reference-contexts: WebWhacker [ ForeFront] addresses the problem of slow access to course materials, by copying Web pages to the client machine, but interactive pages that invoke scripts on the Web server do not always function properly when copied.

Reference-contexts: These changes will be specified using simple if-then rules similar to those in RIDES [Munro et al 1993]. When dynamic patient state changes are required, we will probably adopt a dynamic state transition model similar to the one used by Eliot and Woolf in the Cardiac Tutor <ref> [Eliot and Woolf 1995] </ref>. The Adele agent is a simplified subset of the Steve agent architecture.

Reference-contexts: The task model is a partial order plan describing the actions that the student might perform, what the actions can be expected to achieve, and what other actions they enable. Following the approach used in our earlier REACT system <ref> [Hill and Johnson 1995] </ref>, subtasks can also be annotated with goals that the subtask should achieve if it is performed correctly. The model permits Adele to interpret the students actions by comparing them against the actions in Adeles plan.

Reference-contexts: The agent realization is the graphical appearance of the agent that the student sees. The agent appearance controller is patterned partly on Microsoft Agent <ref> [Microsoft 1997] </ref>. Adele appears as a cartoon-like character, which consults with videos of real physicians in order to provide medical instruction when necessary. Authoring an ADE simulation differs from authoring a conventional course.

Reference-contexts: For such cases student actions can lead to changes in body position parameters but not in vital sign or pathological state parameters. These changes will be specified using simple if-then rules similar to those in RIDES <ref> [Munro et al 1993] </ref>. When dynamic patient state changes are required, we will probably adopt a dynamic state transition model similar to the one used by Eliot and Woolf in the Cardiac Tutor [Eliot and Woolf 1995].
