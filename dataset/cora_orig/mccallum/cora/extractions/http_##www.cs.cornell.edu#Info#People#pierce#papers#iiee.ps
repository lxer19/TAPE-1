Title: An Interactive Information Extraction Environment  
Author: David Pierce

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Cornell University  
Abstract: Building information extraction systems is costly for users who lack annotated training corpora or knowledge engineering expertise. This paper proposes a framework for an interactive information extraction environment in which the user trains the system by example and by feedback about performance. If successful, this will be the first system that allows end-users to create information extraction systems without the aid of computational linguists and NLP system designers.
