Abstract: Many recent research efforts in computer security focus on constructing provably secure authentication protocols. Although many of the resulting protocols rely on the a priori secure distribution of secret keys, no provably secure key distribution protocols have yet been demonstrated. In this paper, we use an existing secure two-party authentication protocol as a stepping stone for constructing a series of simple and secure key distribution protocols. The protocols are shown to satisfy desired security requirements, using the security properties of the underlying authentication protocol.

Reference-contexts: Although popular and fairly widespread, Kerberos has been subject to considerable criticism both for the protocols it is based on as well as for their implementation (see, for example, <ref> [1] </ref>.) More recently, research efforts began to develop (or to provide tools needed for developing) authentication protocols with some formal assurance of security. Most notably, formal tools for testing authentication protocols were developed, e.g., BAN logic [4] and its successor, GNY logic [8].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Research in authentication protocols has been fairly active since the publication in the late 1970s of the Need-ham and Schroeder landmark paper <ref> [11] </ref>. In it, they proposed a family of protocols for two- and three-party authentication and key distribution. The distinguishing feature of these protocols was the use of encryption for authentication. The protocols were subsequently shown to contain some subtle weaknesses (e.g., [5]).

Reference-contexts: However, it is still quite inefficient. Furthermore its use sometimes presents a problem because of the associated patent issues. Finally, most public key methods impose a fairly large basic encryption block size (e.g., a 512 bits is a recommended minimum for RSA <ref> [14] </ref>.) In light of these concerns we proceed with conventional encryption in mind. Nonetheless, for the sake of generality, the resulting protocols must not have any features that rule out the use of public key cryptography. * No decryption A typical cryptosystem has two components: encryption and decryption.

Reference-contexts: First, decryption makes the implementation more complex. Second, it rules out the use of strong one-way hash functions in place of traditional encryption techniques (and where only encryption is needed, strong one-way hash functions can be used instead at much lower cost; see, for example, <ref> [17] </ref>.) Finally, protocols using only encryption (but no decryption) avoid the entire issue of exportability which is relevant at least in the United States. * Minimal overhead The key distribution protocol we intend to construct should impose minimal additional overhead on the existing authentication protocol it is based on.
