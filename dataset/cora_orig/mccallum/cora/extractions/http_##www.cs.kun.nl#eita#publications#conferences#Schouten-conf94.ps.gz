Abstract: Segmentation methods for images often have cost functions which evaluate the (dis)similarity between pixels or segments. Thresholds on cost values are then used to decide whether or not to grow, join or split segments. The results for a given image critically depend on the selection of the threshold values. In remote sensing, a too low threshold will split up regions of constant ground cover and a too high threshold will join adjacent regions of different ground cover. Optimal thresholds can be determined using different classes of methods: * comparing a "true" segmentation with the results of segmentation using a range of thresholds. Several methods for threshold determination are described for a hybrid segmentation method developed by us. Measures are described for comparison of two segmentations. Results are evaluated using several real and artificially generated images.

Although quality measures to evaluate segmentation results are sometimes used [2, 3, 4, 5], there is no generally accepted standard. Liu and Yang <ref> [4] </ref> use the following evaluation function to measure the badness of a segmentation: F = R fi i=1 i p with: * R the number of regions in the segmented image * e i the intensity error of region i: the sum of the Euclidean distance of the intensity vectors between <p> Using one of the quality measures taking segmentations with a very high threshold as the "true" segmentation, gives indications of thresholds where over-growing is already a problem thus where the thresholds are already too high. The evaluation function F as used by Liu and Yang <ref> [4] </ref> was shown not to produce an useful indication of a threshold value. Further research will be directed towards incorporating mixed pixels into the quality measures. For real images human expert segmentation will be obtained assigning pixels either to a field or to a mixed pixel category. <p> More realistic artificial images with small field separating objects will be generated where the true segmentation is known to sub-pixel level [11].
