Abstract: Define the MOD m -degree of a boolean function F to be the smallest degree of any polynomial P , over the ring of integers modulo m, such that for all 0-1 assignments ~x, F (~x) = 0 iff P (~x) = 0. By exploring the periodic property of the binomial coefficients modulo m, two new lower bounds on the M OD m -degree of the M OD l and :M OD m functions are proved, where m is any composite integer and l has a prime factor not dividing m. Both bounds improve from sub-linear to (n). With the periodic property, a simple proof of a lower bound on the MOD m -degree with symmetric multilinear polynomial of the OR function is given. It is also proved that the majority function has a lower bound n

Reference-contexts: These bounds substantially improve previous results <ref> [1] </ref>, use elementary methods, and, we hope shed some more light on the power of the M OD m function for composite m. Recall that the Smolensky-Razborov technique seems not applicable in this situation, and Szegedy's dissertation [12] also shows that such gates are surprisingly powerful. <p> Paturi [9] studied the degree of real polynomials that approximate symmetric boolean functions. In [13, 14] Tarui proved some results on the degree complexity of boolean functions over rings and he applied these results to prove the separations of certain relativized classes. In <ref> [1] </ref> Barrington, Beigel and Rudich studied representing boolean functions as polynomials modulo m. Our work is an extension of the results in [1]. <p> In <ref> [1] </ref> Barrington, Beigel and Rudich studied representing boolean functions as polynomials modulo m. Our work is an extension of the results in [1]. <p> cannot compute the M OD q function (the boolean function M OD m (x 1 ; :::; x n ) is defined to be 0 if P n i=0 x i is a multiple of m and 1 otherwise) when p and q are distinct primes, suggest the following definition <ref> [1] </ref>. A polynomial P over Z m represents a boolean function F if for all 0-1 valued assignments ~x, F (~x) = 0 iff P (~x) = 0. <p> These results depends crucially on the fact that Z p is a finite field. For composite moduli, when Z m is a ring, and not a field, many of the lemmas simply fall apart. Barrington, Beigel and Rudich <ref> [1] </ref> proved the first few lower bounds for the OR and MOD functions for composite m. They proved that if the representing polynomial is symmetric ffi (OR; m) = fi ( r p n), where r is the number of distinct prime factors of m. <p> These improve the bounds in <ref> [1] </ref> for the case m is not square-free. Our proofs rely on a periodic property of the binomial coefficients. They are simpler and more straightforward than the previous proofs of weaker statements. 2 Notations As a convention, [n] denotes the set f1; 2; ; ng. <p> ffi (M OD l ; m) = ffi (M OD (l;1) ; m) + c, where c is a constant. 8 From the above fact and following the lines in the proof of Theorem 8, we have the following theorem, which not only improves a previous sub-linear lower bound in <ref> [1] </ref> but also extends it to any composite integer m. Theorem 10 Let m be a positive composite integer and q be a prime number which is not a factor of m, then ffi (M OD q ; m) = (n). Proof.

Reference-contexts: This is an interesting complexity measure on its own, and, in the case of prime moduli, yields lower bounds for circuit size. For moduli m that are prime, or a prime power, the situation is well understood <ref> [11, 2] </ref>. It is known that for the OR function of n variables ffi (OR; p) = d n p1 e [11, 15]. It is also known that ffi (M OD l ; p) = (n) when l is not a power of p.

Reference-contexts: While the problem of proving nonlinear size lower bounds for general boolean functions is still not in sight, very powerful results are available for restricted classes, such as monotone circuits, or circuits of unbounded fan-in gates with small depth <ref> [4, 16] </ref>. One of the major tools in obtaining these lower bounds, was the use of algebraic techniques [10, 11, 12]. As a result, several researchers started the study of polynomials that in some sense represent boolean functions.
