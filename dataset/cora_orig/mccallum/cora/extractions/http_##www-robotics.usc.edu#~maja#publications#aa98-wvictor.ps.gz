Abstract: We describe and compare two implemented controllers for Adonis, a physically simulated humanoid torso, one based on joint-space torques and the other on convergent force-fields applied to the hands. The two come from different application domains: the former is a common approach in manipulator robotics and graphics, while the latter is inspired by biological limb control. Both avoid explicit inverse kinematic calculations found in standard Cartesian control, trading generality of motion for programming efficiency. The two approaches are compared on a common sequential task, the familiar dance "Macarena" and evaluated based on ease of generating new behaviors, flexibility, and naturalness of movement; we also compare them against human performance on the same task. Finally, we discuss the tradeoffs and present a more general framework for addressing complex motor control of simulated agents.

Reference-contexts: Various neural network approaches to learning IK for simple manipulators have been explored and more sophisticated learning methods for dynamic tasks and higher DOF systems are being developed <ref> (Atkeson 1989, Schaal & Atkeson 1994) </ref>. The work most similar to the force-field approach we describe was performed by Williamson (1996), who presented a controller for a 6-DOF robot arm, based on the same biological evidence we describe next.

Reference-contexts: The magnitude of c determines the speed of the complete movement. For well-chosen values of c, this model makes the hand position converge to the EP, following a roughly bell-shaped velocity profile, consistent with human data on regular-speed reaching motions <ref> (Flash & Hogan 1985) </ref>. Linear combinations of the force-fields can produce new fields with convergence points in the convex hull of the EPs of the bases. Bases can be combined using vector summation, as in our approach, or using a winner-take-all framework, as used by Williamson (1996) for robot reaching.

Reference-contexts: The idea of supplying an agent with a collection of basis behaviors or primitives representing force-fields, and combining those into a general repertoire for complex motion, is very appealing. Our previous work <ref> (Mataric 1995, Mataric 1997) </ref>, inspired by the same biological results, has already successfully applied the idea of basis behaviors to control of planar mobile agents/robots. This paper extends the notion to agents with more DOFs. Another inspiration comes from psychophysical data describing what people fixate on when observing human movement.

Reference-contexts: In robotics, standard methods have been developed for simpler manipulators and have been gradually scaled up to more complex arms <ref> (Paul 1981, Brady, Hollerbach, Johnson, Lozano-Perez & Mason 1982) </ref> and recently to physical human-like arms (Schaal 1997, Williamson 1996). <p> In robotics, manipulator control has been largely addressed for point-to-point reaching, typically by specifying Cartesian 3D goals and explicitly solving the IK for the manipulator's joint angles <ref> (Paul 1981, Brady et al. 1982) </ref>. Various neural network approaches to learning IK for simple manipulators have been explored and more sophisticated learning methods for dynamic tasks and higher DOF systems are being developed (Atkeson 1989, Schaal & Atkeson 1994). <p> For example, placing hands behind the head is best represented by a Cartesian constraint while turning the hand is better treated as a joint constraint. The issue of coordinate and representation transformation has been addressed extensively in manipulator robotics <ref> (Paul 1981, Brady et al. 1982) </ref>. The two controllers implemented favor very different representations and thus the evaluation of their ability to satisfy all of the various subgoals serves as an effective performance metric. The force-field controller employs a 3D equilibrium point as a control handle.
