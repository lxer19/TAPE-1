Abstract: Let S be a set of n moving points in the plane. We give new efficient and compact kinetic data structures for maintaining the diameter, width, and smallest area or perimeter bounding rectangle of the points. When the points in S move with pseudo-algebraic motions, these structures process O(n 2+* ) events. We also give constructions showing that (n 2 ) combinatorial changes are possible in these extent functions even when the points move on straight lines with constant velocities. We give a similar construction and upper bound for the convex hull, improving known results.

Reference-contexts: When we add time as a third dimension, we see that the total number of antipodal pairs created is equal to the number of envelope surface patches whose projections into the xt-plane overlap. This quantity is bounded by O (n 2+* ) <ref> [1] </ref>. The separation of each antipodal pair is a pseudo-algebraic function of time, and hence the upper envelope of these functions has O (n 2+* ) complexity; the kinetic tournament computes this upper envelope (the diameter) within essentially the same time bound. <p> (ff) + t c (ff + ): Then the position of p (t) can be expressed in polar coordinates, p (t) = (r p (t); p (t)), in terms of (t) = tan 1 ((2t 1) tan 2 ), which varies in the range [=2; =2] as t varies in <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. r p (t) = 2 p (t) = ff + 2 by linear motion along equal-length chords Note that the initial position p (0) does not appear in the expression for r p (t). <p> linearly along chords of the unit circle: q j (t) = (1 t) c 7 + 8m 8 j : Theorem 4.1 The diameter of the set of n linearly moving points described above is defined by (n 2 ) different pairs of points during the time interval t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. Proof: As noted above, the points of Q lie on a common circle whose radius varies with time. The angular position of q j (t) is j (t) = + 8m j + (t), for 8 . <p> i , q j (t), and the origin are collinear iff j + (t); that is, iff (t) = 8m i j : Each (i; j) pair determines a unique value of (t) in the interval [ 8 ; 8 ], which corresponds to a unique value of t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; call this value t ij . Thus there are m 2 = fi (n 2 ) distinct values t ij 2 [0; 1] such that (p i ; q j (t ij )) is the unique diametral pair of the point set at time t ij . 4.2 Width <p> Each (i; j) pair determines a unique value of (t) in the interval [ 8 ; 8 ], which corresponds to a unique value of t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>; call this value t ij . Thus there are m 2 = fi (n 2 ) distinct values t ij 2 [0; 1] such that (p i ; q j (t ij )) is the unique diametral pair of the point set at time t ij . 4.2 Width lower bound con struction In this section we give an (n 2 ) lower bound on the number of distinct vertex triples that <p> Theorem 4.3 The width of the set of n linearly moving points described above is defined by (n 2 ) different triples of points during the time interval t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>. <p> In fact, we show in the full paper that all the points appear on the convex hull for all t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, in the same order. <p> The following arguments make this construction more precise. Lemma 4.4 Let p 1 ; : : : ; p n be points on a circle with radius r 1, centered at the origin. Assume that these points satisfy p i;x &gt; 0 and p i;y 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref> for all i, i.e., they lie on a short arc near the positive x-axis. Also let Q be the square whose vertices q 1 ; : : : ; q 4 are the points (1; 1). <p> Also let Q be the square whose vertices q 1 ; : : : ; q 4 are the points (1; 1). Then the minimum-area (or minimum-perimeter) bounding box that encloses the p i and Q is given by B = <ref> [1; x max ] </ref> fi [1; 1], where x max = max i p i;x . 8 The construction now proceeds as follows. <p> Also let Q be the square whose vertices q 1 ; : : : ; q 4 are the points (1; 1). Then the minimum-area (or minimum-perimeter) bounding box that encloses the p i and Q is given by B = [1; x max ] fi <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, where x max = max i p i;x . 8 The construction now proceeds as follows. <p> Let 4n 4 i q j (t) = (1 t) c + 8n 2 j + t c for i; j 2 f1; : : : ; ng.

Reference-contexts: Kinetic data structures by contrast gain their efficiency by exploiting the continuity or coherence in the way the system state changes. Secondly, unlike Atallah's dynamic computational geometry framework <ref> [2] </ref>, which was introduced to estimate the maximum number of combinatorial changes in a geometric configuration under predetermined motions in a certain class, the KDS framework is fully on-line and allows each object to change its motion at will, due to interactions with other moving objects, the environment, etc. <p> The upper envelope at any point in time is given by a 2-D slice through the 3-D upper envelope of surfaces. Because the convex hull of n points in pseudo-algebraic motion changes O (n 2+* ) times, for any * &gt; 0 <ref> [2] </ref>, the upper envelope of surfaces has the same complexity. At any instant in time, the antipodal pairs of the hull are determined by the overlay of two 2-D envelopes.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is to focus on these discrete changes or events and track through time the combinatorial description of the extent measure of interest. We do so within the framework of kinetic data structures (KDSs for short), as developed by Basch, Guibas, and Hershberger <ref> [3] </ref> and further elaborated in Section 2. There are two notable and novel aspects of that framework. Firstly, while extensive work has been done on dynamic data structures in computational geometry [4], this is all focused on handling insertions/deletions of objects and not continuous change. <p> Efficient, local, and compact kinetic data structures are known for maintaining the convex hull and closest pair of points moving in the plane, and for computing the maximum of points moving along a line <ref> [3] </ref>. The data structure for computing the maximum is known as a kinetic tournament. 3 Algorithms In this section we present kinetic data structures for maintaining three different versions of the extent of a planar point set: diameter, width, and minimum enclosing box. <p> Each of these data structures is based on the kinetic data structure of Basch, Guibas, and Hershberger for maintaining the convex hull of a point set in motion <ref> [3] </ref>. On top of that data structure we build a kinetization of the rotating calipers algorithm [5, 7], specialized to the desired version of the extent. 3.1 Diameter The diameter of a point set is the maximum pairwise separation of two points in the set.

A standard way to compute the diameter of a static point set is to compute the convex hull, find all pairs of antipodal vertices by a linear scan around the hull boundary, and then identify the pair with maximum separation <ref> [5] </ref>. In this section we show how to kinetize this algorithm. Before we proceed, let us dualize the problem, because the computation of antipodal points is easier to describe in the dual setting.

Reference-contexts: We also prove a tighter upper bound than was previously known for the number of combinatorial changes to the convex hull. This bound is O (n s (n)), where s (n) is the length of a Davenport-Schinzel sequence <ref> [6] </ref>, and the parameter s bounds the number of times three points can become collinear. <p> This improves the lower bound example given by Sharir and Agarwal <ref> [6] </ref>, which uses quadratic motions. 9 We define two convoys of oppositely moving points. The points always lie on a common circle (which varies in size), so all are on the convex hull, but their order along the circle changes. <p> The theorem below shows that in this case there are O (n 2k (n)) changes to the convex hull. This improves the bound of O (n 2k+2 (n)) given in <ref> [6] </ref>. In particular, it implies that for linear motion the number of changes is O (n 2 ), matching the lower bound of the preceding section.
