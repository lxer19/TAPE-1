Reference-contexts: The representation of such a structural information usually requires a particular semantics together with specialized inference, but rarely do current modeling formalisms and methodologies give it a specific, "first-class" dignity [ Si-mons, 1987; Guarino, 1994 ] .

Reference-contexts: Such features, characterizing the interdependence between the parts and wholes, can be expressed using qualified number restrictions on complex roles <ref> [ Sattler, 1995; Baader and Sattler, 1996 ] </ref> . For example, one could say that a given tank is used exclusively by the reactors of a given system in the following way: Tank v (= 1 (IS-D-COMP ffi IS-D-COMP) System) u 8IS-D-COMP. (:Reactor t 9IS-D-COMP. <p> is not known what it happens if a complex role like the composition of two direct part roles or the transitive "" role appears in the number restriction: these are languages including ALC + N (ffi) - recently argued to be undecidable and ALC + N (+) as defined in <ref> [ Baader and Sattler, 1996 ] </ref> . Another kind of dependency between parts known in the KR community as structural description - characterizes the integrity of the whole.

Reference-contexts: Tire) then, the fact that tires are also parts of cars semantically follows: Car v 9. Tire. The complexity of satisfiability and subsumption for ALC with a transitive closure operator has been shown to be EXPTIME-complete <ref> [ Baader, 1991 ] </ref> . Sometimes, one would like to define parts from wholes or conversely wholes from parts. Thus, the inverse role of the has-part role is needed: : = 1 .

Reference-contexts: Thus, a well-founded transitive relation is a good candidate for a proper part-whole relation: it is finite, antisymmetric, irreflexive and obviously transitive - i.e., a strict partial order with no infinite descending chain. <ref> [ Calvanese et al., 1995 ] </ref> introduce CVL, an EXPTIME-complete language extending CI and handling well-foundedness. Within this approaches, the basic primitive part role denotes a direct part relation. Therefore, it should verify the definition of immediate inferior, taken from lattice theory. <p> The same limit applies also for the structural descriptions (see next section), at least as it is seen in the current systems. On the other hand, approaches based on the modal interpretations of description logics <ref> [ Schild, 1991; Sattler, 1995; Calvanese et al., 1995 ] </ref> , do suffer of a dual limitation. Several properties which do hold at the TBox level, and which are correctly taken into account in the intensional reasoning process, do not hold any more at ABox level.

Reference-contexts: A possible limited way to express it using qualification is shown by the following example, where the Tank is an exclusive part of a given System: Tank v (= 1 System) u 8. (= 1 System) Having qualified number restrictions is an hard problem anyway. <ref> [ De Giacomo and Lenzerini, 1995 ] </ref> show the complexity of satisfiability for CIQ a language admitting qualified number restrictions only on boolean combination of primitive roles and inverses of them being in the EXPTIME class.

We speak of downward distributivity when there are properties which the parts inherit from the whole. For instance certain locative properties (e.g., "being in the car park") of the whole hold also for its parts: Car = 9 (&lt; LOCATION). Car-Park u 9.

This rules out simplifying approaches like the one pursued by <ref> [ Padgham and Lambrix, 1994; Lambrix, 1996 ] </ref> and [ Speel and Patel-Schneider, 1994 ] .

Reference-contexts: Thus, it is not possible for the primitive direct part relation to satisfy the immediate inferior property. In order to differentiate among various part relations, <ref> [ Sattler, 1995 ] </ref> introduces six primitive roles denoting direct parts: IS-D-COMP, IS-D-MEMBER, IS-D-SEGMENT, IS-D-QUANTITY, IS-D-INGREDIENT, IS-D-STUFF, where D stands for direct for example, IS-D-COMPONENT can be read as "is a direct component of ". <p> The same limit applies also for the structural descriptions (see next section), at least as it is seen in the current systems. On the other hand, approaches based on the modal interpretations of description logics <ref> [ Schild, 1991; Sattler, 1995; Calvanese et al., 1995 ] </ref> , do suffer of a dual limitation.

Reference-contexts: Another way to represent the part-whole relation, is to have a specific transitive role in the language, without having at the same time the primitive direct part relation. This extension has been analyzed in <ref> [ Sattler, 1996 ] </ref> ; it is in correspondence with the union of multimodal K and S4 - i.e. K4 n . Satisfiability and susbump-tion in ALC with transitive roles have been proved to be PSPACE-complete. This approach seems definitely to be more promising from a complexity point of view.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the inverse role of the has-part role is needed: : = 1 . This can be captured by the CI (in correspondence with converse-PDL, also known as T SL) concept language; satisfiabil-ity and subsumption for CI is again EXPTIME-complete <ref> [ Schild, 1991 ] </ref> . Another important property of part-whole relations is well-foundedness. A relation is well-founded if there is no infinite chain in it: this corresponds to an atomic mereology. <p> In order to express such interactions, complex roles are needed; the language CI is enough to express these requirements. However, in order to express also disjointness among different part-whole relations, conjunction of roles is needed: such language is at least as expressive as T SLR <ref> [ Schild, 1991 ] </ref> , which is still an open problem. More generally, it is useful to differentiate among several different part names: while modeling composite individuals it seems natural to give specific names to attributes denoting parts [ Artale et al., 1996 ] . <p> The same limit applies also for the structural descriptions (see next section), at least as it is seen in the current systems.

Reference-contexts: then we can derive that: FemurCondyle-Fracture v Femur-Fracture but not: Thoracic-Scoliosis v Spine-Scoliosis The decidability and the complexity of ALC with the transitive "" relation and the left and right plural quantifiers is still an open problem, mainly because distributive plural quantifiers recall role-value-maps even if in a simplified form <ref> [ Schmidt-Schau, 1989 ] </ref> . 6 Conclusions Part-whole relations have been extensively used in order to convey structural information. We have seen how their semantic peculiarities pose a number of modeling and reasoning problems, which require careful choices.
