Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This report describes the Soviet (now Russian) encryption algorithm. The details of the algorithm were published in 1990 as the Soviet Standard (GOST 28147-89) <ref> [1] </ref>. The algorithm can be implemented in both hardware and software. The level of security of encrypted information is flexible. The algorithm can be used to protect information in computer systems and computer networks. 2 The description of the algorithm The algorithm (also called cryptosystem) is summarized in Figure 1.
