Abstract: We describe the structure and development of WAXweb, a dynamic MOO-based hypermedia database which is being used as a VRML server. We also discuss the future of 3D MUD-like systems, describing the particular problems of highly-interactive, distributed 3D scenes. So that we can begin to experiment with these areas using commonly-available VRML browsers, this paper describes several extensions for VRML 1.x which will allow for simple dynamic multiuser interactions.

Reference-contexts: This could allow for dynamically changing geometries, interpolating camera positions, or entirely new scenes to be downloaded. Netscape 1.1 introduced two preliminary extensions to the HTTP protocol which would allow for such behavior <ref> [Com95] </ref>. In server push, the server sends a message of MIME type multipart/x-mixed-replace, which defines an incoming stream of messages, each of which will replace the previous one. The client holds the socket open and waits for new types of media, until the server or the user breaks the connection.

Reference-contexts: All the VRML scenes are generated dynamically, from the underlying object-oriented database. 2.1 Object model The underlying object model and programming language of the MOO server <ref> [Cur93] </ref> encourage rapid exploration. It uses a prototype-delegation object model with dynamic inheritance, which we believe to be almost a necessity for any highly-interactive, flexible environment. It incorporates a persistent object store, and new objects and methods can be added while the server is running.

Reference-contexts: We use the MOO to dynamically serve HTML documents from the underlying database, and deliver 3000 WWW pages, containing 7000 pictures, many interleaving layers of semantic indexing, 1 1/2 hours of MPEG video, and the entire audio of the film in English, French, German, and Japanese <ref> [MBH94] </ref>. 2 VRML Implementation The original film had roughly more than ten minutes of computer-generated imagery; we have taken 250 of the 3D models, originally developed on an Amiga, and imported them as VRML models, to serve as a spatial and contextual index to the multimedia data.
