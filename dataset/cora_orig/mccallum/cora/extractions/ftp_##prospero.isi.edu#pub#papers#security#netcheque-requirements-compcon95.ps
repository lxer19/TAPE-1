Abstract: Secure methods of payment are needed before we will see widespread commercial use of the Internet. Recently proposed and implemented payment methods follow one of three models: electronic currency, credit-debit, and secure credit card transactions. Such payment services have different strengths and weaknesses with respect to the requirements of of security, reliability, scalability, anonymity, acceptability, customer base, flexibility, convertibility, efficiency, ease of integration with applications, and ease of use. NetCheque is a payment system based on the credit-debit model. NetCheque is described and its strengths with respect to these requirements are discussed.

Reference-contexts: out of their way to do so. 3 Payment models Recently proposed, announced, and implemented Internet payment mechanisms can be grouped into three broad classes: electronic currency systems, credit-debit systems, and systems supporting secure presentation of credit card numbers. 3.1 Electronic currency With electronic currency systems like Chaum's Digi-Cash system <ref> [1] </ref>, currently being tested on the Internet, and USC-ISI's NetCash TM system [5], customers purchase electronic currency certificates from a currency server.

Reference-contexts: In some cases the payee's and payer's accounting servers can settle the check directly, bypassing higher levels of the hierarchy. This is possible when the cheque is drawn on an accounting server that is trusted to properly settle accounts. Such trust might be based on certificates of insurance <ref> [3] </ref> representing endorsement of the accounting server in much the same way that the FDIC insures banks in the United States.

Reference-contexts: This is extremely important for payments by businesses and, we assert, desired by individuals for a significant percentage of their transactions. This model does not typically provide anonymity, though it may be extended to do so <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. For credit-debit or electronic currency systems to move beyond trials with play money, a separate tie to the existing banking system is needed to convert account balances and electronic currency to and from real money in a customer or merchant's bank account.

Reference-contexts: Authorized signers write cheques against these accounts, while the organization maintains a single account with an outside bank, integrating its own internal accounting system with the external financial system. The NetCheque accounting system was designed originally <ref> [6] </ref> to maintain quotas for distributed system resources, resulting in frequent transactions for small amounts. Thus, itis well suited to support small payments needed for some kinds of electronic commerce. This requirement for handling micropayments requires high performance which is obtained through the use of conventional, instead of public-key, cryptography. <p> Proceedings of IEEE Compcon'95, San Francisco, March 1995. 4.1 Implementation overview The system is based on the Kerberos system [7], and the electronic signature used when writing or endorsing a cheque is a special kind of Kerberos ticket called a proxy <ref> [6] </ref>.
