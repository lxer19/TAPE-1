Abstract: The emergence of generalist and specialist behavior in populations of neural networks is studied. Energy extracting ability is included as a property of an organism. In artificial life simulations with organisms living in an environment, the fitness score can be interpreted as the combination of an organisms behavior and the ability of the organism to extract energy from potential food sources distributed in the environment. The energy extracting ability is viewed as an evolvable trait of organisms a particular organism's mechanisms for extracting energy from the environment and, therefore, it is not fixed and decided by the researcher. Simulations with fixed and evolvable energy extracting abilities show that the energy extracting mechanism, the sensory apparatus, and the behavior of organisms may co-evolve and be co-adapted. The results suggest that populations of organisms evolve to be generalists or specialists due to individual energy extracting abilities.

Reference-contexts: However, this is still looking at genetic algorithms from an engineering point of view, as tools for obtaining some desired result. If genetic algorithms are viewed as models of natural biological phenomena (both real and possible, according to the definition of artificial life <ref> (Langton, 1992) </ref>), then it is not clear that nature has some desired result to obtain - a particular behavior or the maximation of some function. In the biological world all is change and all components of an evolving system tend to co-evolve.

Reference-contexts: But if one adopts an artificial life framework and applies genetic algorithms to populations of ecological neural networks, i.e. networks which behave in and interact with an environment <ref> (Parisi et al., 1990) </ref>, things begin to look different. The goal of the genetic algorithm may cease to be that of maximizing a given fitness formula and may become that of developing systems that exhibit a certain type of behavior in a particular environment.
