Abstract: Wireless networks are being driven by the need for providing network access to mobile or nomadic computing devices. Although the need for wireless access to a network is evident, new problems are inherent in the wireless medium itself. Specif ically, the wireless medium introduces new opportunities for eavesdropping of wireless data communications. Anyone with the appropriate wireless receiver can eavesdrop and this kind of eavesdropping is virtually undetectable. Furthermore, since the wireless medium cannot be contained by the usual physical constraints of walls and doors, active intrusions through the wireless medium are also made easier. In order to prevent this opportunity for unauthorized access to the network we present the design of a secure communication protocol that provides for both privacy of the wireless data communications and authenticity of the communicating parties. W e show the placement of the protocol in the overall protocol stack and discuss issues relevant to wireless links and mobile computing devices. We also present a proof of the security of the protocol using the Logic of Authentication formalism developed by Burrows, Abadi and Needham. The design goals of the protocol presented here and its placement in the protocol stack are driven by a number of requirements. A major requirement driving the placement of the security function in the protocol stack is seamless integration into existing wired networks. A large number of network applications operating in the existing wired network assume some level of security arising from the physical security of network wiring. Unfortunately, since the wireless medium has no physical protection, introducing a wireless network makes this assumption false. In the interest of allowing the existing application base to function at least as securely as it did over a wired network, we secure the wireless link itself. Two other likely alternatives, end-to-end security at the application layer and end-to-end security at the transport layer, are considered inappropriate, given the requirement for seamless integration into the existing networks. An implication of seamless integration is that the very large number of existing nodes in the wired network should not be modif ied. Stipulating either of application or transport layer based end-to-end security would require modifying the software base of the entire fixed node network, should the portable need to have the same level of network access as any node on the wired network.

Reference-contexts: The Logic of Authentication formalism does not deal with issues such as forward-secrecy, but this is an additional goal of our protocol. Also, in our protocol we avoided the use of synchronized clocks. Requiring synchronized clocks has many problems associated with it <ref> [5] </ref>. Using a challengeresponse mechanism avoids these problems. Assumption i) makes explicit the fact that part of the session key (RN1) is being used for authentication purposes, another desirable attribute of an authentication protocol.

Reference-contexts: This is compatible in spirit with the SIGNED ASN.1 macro of X.509, except for the fact that the signature is not computed over fields that are entirely contained in the messages themselves. A set of standards from RSADSI, Inc., collectively known as Public Key Cryptography Standards Page 10 (PKCS) <ref> [8] </ref>, specify several digital signature and public key algorithms. Examples of these include MD2 with RSA encryption and the RSA public key cryptosystem. These may be employed for the certificate and protocol related digital signatures and public key encryptions.

Reference-contexts: These may be employed for the certificate and protocol related digital signatures and public key encryptions. Appendix We now prove the security of the protocol using the Logic of Authentication formalism developed by Burrows, Abadi and Needham <ref> [9] </ref>. This formalism has limitations in describing server less protocols, such as ours. The limitation has to do with accepting the validity of a public key certificate. All that can be logically derived from a certificate is that the CA once-said K a speaks for A.
