Abstract: 1.0 Abstract A fundamental axiom of computer system design holds that "any software design problem can be solved by adding an extra level of indirection." This paper expresses a variant of this axiom in pattern form as the "Identity Indirection" pattern. This pattern has been used for decades in many different types of systems in the software industry. It is so common that many developers hardly notice it anymore.

Reference-contexts: When combined with the Proxy and Factory patterns <ref> [GoF] </ref>, this identity indirection allows client wrappers to be written that have the same binding interface for all services, but different underlying interface implementations. This approach uses an indirect identity on top of the existing toolkit implementations without forcing a change in interface models.
