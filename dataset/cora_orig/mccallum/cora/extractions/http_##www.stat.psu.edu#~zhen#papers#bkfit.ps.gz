Title: Backfitting in Smoothing Spline ANOVA  
Author: By Zhen Luo 
Affiliation: Pennsylvania State University  
Abstract: A scheme to compute smoothing spline ANOVA estimates for large data sets with a (near) tensor-product structure is proposed. Such data sets are common in spatial-temporal analysis and image analysis. This scheme combines backfitting algorithm with iterative imputation algorithm in order to save both computational space and time. The convergence of this algorithm and various ways to further speed it up, such as collapsing component functions and successive over-relaxation, are discussed. Issues related to its application in spatial-temporal analysis are discussed too. An application to a global analysis of historical surface temperature data is described.

Reference-contexts: We first choose 1 = 10 0:1 and 2 = 10 4:5 which corresponds to the case in which little smoothing is done to g 1 and g 2 , then choose 3 and 4 by way of a crude grid search according to a randomized GCV criterion <ref> (see Girard, 1989) </ref>, which gives us a choice of 3 = 10 1:25 and 4 = 10 4:1 . The estimated g 2 and g ;2 are plotted in Figure 2 and Figure 3 respectively.

Reference-contexts: For the temporal component, besides the penalty defined by that the 2-nd (or m-th) order differences are independent and identically distributed normal variables, which represents a class of short-range memory dependence, long-range memory dependence modeled through fractional differencing <ref> (Hosking 1981, Haslett and Raftery 1989) </ref> may also be used in our model (see, Taam and Yandell, 1989). For the spatial component, the one we have used, (18), is in a family developed by Wahba (1981). Other families such as Matern's (1986) and Vecchia's (1985) may be used too.

Reference-contexts: We can see that the smoothing spline ANOVA approach can correct such biases without even using anomalies. data; squares with cross inside: yearly averages of anomaly; solid squares: based on the smoothing spline estimate defined by (14). The data set we used is so-called Jones-Wigley data set <ref> (see Jones, et al., 1991) </ref>. We obtained this data set from http://cdiac.ESD.ORNL.GOV/ftp/.

Reference-contexts: It is derived through a Bayesian interpretation of (14), but has some desirable frequentist properties. Computing such intervals faces similar difficulties as fitting the model does. Parallel to the computational procedure proposed in Section 1, a Monte Carlo method, the Gibbs sampler combined with data augmentation <ref> (Tanner and Wong, 1987) </ref> just like the backfitting combined with iterative imputation, may be used to sample from the posterior distribution, hence to get confidence intervals needed.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately our case falls into this category. Consider system (32), and denote: A := B B B I S 0 S 0 S 3 0 I C C C : Obviously A is consistently ordered <ref> (see Young 1971, pp. 144-145) </ref>. If we can show that all the eigenvalues of B := I (diag A) 1 A are real and have absolute values less than 1, then according to Theorem 2.2 on page 172 of Young (1971), SOR will converge for any ! in (0; 2). <p> Furthermore, according to Theorem 2.3 on the same page, the best choice of ! is ! b = 1 + 1 2 where is the spectral radius of B. It can be shown <ref> (Young 1971, Theorem 2.2, p. 142) </ref> that 2 is the spectral radius of the Gauss-Seidel iteration matrix which can be estimated by the power method after some Gauss-Seidel iteration steps are taken. See Young (1971, p. 206) for an explanation.
