Abstract: Training of feed-forward networks is sensitive for learning-parameters, network architecture, etc. So if a feed-forward network fails to solve a pattern classification problem one never knows if the cause of the failure is in the network or in the problem itself. Hence a well-founded indication of the problem's solvability is a helpful tool in engineering with feed-forward networks. We present a method to estimate the solvability of a pattern classification problem. The method is based on the estimation of the Bayes error-rate of the problem, and intergrates classical theories into a novel application. The proposed algorithm is tested on a number of benchmarks and proved to be reliable. We argue that the approach is feasible if many patterns are available and if the dimension of the patterns is relatively low.

Reference-contexts: Without knowledge of a well-founded estimate of a minimum error-rate, one hardly knows whether further fine-tuning of the algorithm would eventually yield better results. The theoretical bound on the error-rate of a pattern classification problem is called the Bayes error-rate <ref> (Duda and Hart 1973) </ref>. In this paper we propose a method to estimate the Bayes error-rate of a pattern classification problem; the method is straightforward and combines algorithms that have been known for decades to a novel application.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we propose a method to estimate the Bayes error-rate of a pattern classification problem; the method is straightforward and combines algorithms that have been known for decades to a novel application. First we use Parzen window estimation <ref> (Parzen 1962) </ref> to make estimates of the probability density functions that underly the data. To calculate the Bayes error-rate we need to integrate these functions; for that we apply Monte Carlo integration (Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, and Flannery 1988). The algorithm is very convenient and almost independent of parameters.

One inputs a pattern classification problem to the algorithm, and the algorithm outputs a reliable estimate of the smallest reachable error-rate of the problem.
