Abstract: Standard software engineering methodologies are typically prescriptions on how to develop some initial system. Here we formalise the process of using an existing, possibly poorly understood, system. Informal vague causal diagrams are a common technique for illustrating and sharing intuitions about such poorly understood systems. Normally, such diagrams are viewed as precursors to other modeling techniques. Here, we take another approach and explore what we can do with these vague diagrams without requiring precise analysis. Vague models can contain inaccuracies and must be tested. In vague domains, if we can't test it then we shouldn't model it. That is, the computational properties of the test engine con strains the modeling process

Reference-contexts: Here, we offer an approximate characterisation of abduction as the search for consistent subsets of some background theory that are relevant for achieving some goal. If multiple subsets can be extracted, then a preference operator (which we call BE ST and Bylander et. al. <ref> [2] </ref> call the plausibility operator pl) must be applied to select the preferred subset (s). Abduction is different to deduction. In deductive inference, all consequences of known literals must be found by the inference procedure. <p> In abduction, the inference engine can ignore parts of the background theory if they are not relevant for the current goal. Abduction is a very general process. Abductive frameworks for various KBS tasks have been defined by numerous researchers; e.g. frame-based reasoning [20], Bayesian reasoning <ref> [2] </ref>, diagnosis [6], explanation [13], and default reasoning [21]. We have also argued that abduction is also useful for planning, monitoring, verification, prediction, classification, qualitative reasoning [18], and validation [17].

Reference-contexts: The reason for this generality is that the processing of subset extraction is a synonym of known general frameworks for expert systems; i.e. Breuker's [1] components of solutions and Clancey's [4] situation-specific models [18]. For example, the formal difference between heuristic classification and heuristic construction <ref> [3] </ref> is the extraction of one subset or multiple conflicting subsets, respectively. 2.2.1 An Example In order to present a detailed example of abduction, we will run an example through our HT4 abductive inference engine [18]. A portion of Figure 1 is shown in Figure 5.

Reference-contexts: An extreme software maintenance problem occurs when handling legacy systems where the maintainer may not even have access to the source code. Vague models must be processed differently to standard software systems. The standard software design activity cycle shown in Figure 2 <ref> [11] </ref>. Logical design comprises a brainstorming elicitation stage followed by a representation stage that systematises the concepts found during elicitation. To make the representations exhibit behaviour, they must be transformed into a lower-level representation which can be operationalised. During this transformation stage, implementation-dependent details will contort the representation.

Reference-contexts: We will note below where the limits of the test device constrain the design process. 2 Background In order to explicate our argument, we begin with some background material about example vague domains (x2.1) and abduction (x2.2). 2.1 Example Vague Domains Elsewhere <ref> [15] </ref>, we have characterised vague domains as: (i) poorly measured, i.e. known data from that domain is insufficient to confirm or deny that some inferred state is valid; (ii) hypothetical, i.e. the domain lacks an authoritative oracle (e.g. a person or a large library of known behaviour) that can declare knowledge

Reference-contexts: If we take these into account, we get Figure 14. In Figure 14 we include for the first time the incompatible vertices (see the double-headed arrows marked with a cross). For more details on the neuroendocrinology model compiler, see <ref> [16] </ref>. 3.3.2 The Data Compiler The data compiler converts tables like Figure 11 into IN and OU T sets of vertices in the dependency graph. For example, in the scenario [] to [dex] in Figure 11, IN 1 = dex=arrived, coldSwim=absent and OU T 2 = nna=up, cortico=down, acth=down.

Reference-contexts: Vague modeling cannot produce correct models. Rather, it can only produce models that contain portions that are useful for known purposes. Our preferred test engine is the HT4 abductive validation engine (summar-ised in x2.2). Previously, we have discussed HT4 and its applications to KBS inference and verification <ref> [17, 18] </ref>.

In our mutation study, 257 theories were artificially generated by adding random vertices and edges to the and-or graph from a theory called Smythe '89 4 . These were run using 5970 experimental comparisons. <p> Six models were used of sizes jVj = f449; 480; 487; 494; 511; 535g. At low fanouts, many behaviours were inexplicable. However, after a fanout of 4.4, most behaviours were explicable. Further, after a fanout of 6.8, nearly all the behaviours were explicable <ref> [17] </ref>.

Further, when these errors were shown to the author of the theory, he found them novel and exciting; i.e. they were significant errors. Smythe '87 is a small theory.
