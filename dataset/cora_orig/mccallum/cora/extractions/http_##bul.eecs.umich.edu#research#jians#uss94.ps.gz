Abstract: We have recently proposed a new coded excitation ultrasound imaging system. The system is based on a discretized linear model of the received data from the region of interest (ROI). Thus the system can be characterized by a linear equation with operator G consisting of on-grid impulse responses. The image reconstruction is obtained by solving the equation with a pseudo-inverse image operator (P IO). Since the reconstruction quality of the system is determined by the P IO, an effective design method is necessary to find an optimal P IO (i.e., a P IO has small noise sensitivity and the degradation of its performance caused by off-grid scatterers is well below a pre-specified tolerable level). In this report, an optimal P IO design method is presented with the help of singular value decomposition (SVD) technique. Given specifications imposed on the P IO, the proposed design method provides effective procedures for searching a set of suitable system parameters (such as grid size, codes, transmit channels, etc). Then, the desirable P IO is evaluated by a method based on the SVD rank reduction technique. Simulation results are given to show the efficiency of the proposed P IO design method.

Reference-contexts: This result agrees with the conclusion obtained in conventional imaging systems. It does not mean, however, that Step 1 in the above design method can be omitted. The reason is that the choice of transmit aperture should also consider the feasibility of filter implementation of the P IO <ref> [3] </ref>. Typically, a larger transmit aperture causes a shorter range interval in which the time shift property of impulse responses along one direction holds.
