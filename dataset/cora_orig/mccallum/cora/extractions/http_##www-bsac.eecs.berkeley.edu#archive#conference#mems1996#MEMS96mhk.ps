Abstract: This paper describes the design and fabrication of micromachined resonant scanners that have large scan angles at fast scan speeds. Driven by an electrostatic comb motor, these 200 m m by 250 m m scanning-micromirrors can scan about 12 (optical) at the resonance frequency of 3 kHz with a sinusoidal voltage input of 20 V in amplitude. Fabricated with a four-poly-layer silicon-surface-micromachining process, these resonant scanners are compact, extremely light in weight, and potentially very low in cost. The power consumption is also minimal since the capacitive motor draws very little current. We have demonstrated the scanner as a laser-beam deflector in a barcode reader, a potentially important application that has a growing popularity in many industries.

Reference-contexts: Silicon-surface-micromachining technology has been used to fabricate micro-optical devices such as movable-micromirrors for building optical components and communication subsystems [1-5]. Motorized micromirrors with actuators integrated on the same chip (such as those in <ref> [1, 2] </ref>) are of particular interest because they make possible truly miniaturized systems. Several authors have proposed different microscanner schemes [6, 7] to be used for optical scanning.

Reference-contexts: Shown in Fig. 1 is a sketch of the barcode scanner built with an electrostatic comb-driven scanning micromirror on a silicon chip. In order to create high-aspect-ratio optical surfaces while taking advantage of integrated-circuit processing technology, polysilicon microhinges <ref> [8] </ref> are incorporated in the scanner structure. They allow the micromirrors to be lifted out of the plane of the substrate after planar processing is completed. RESONANT SCANNER DESIGN resonant scanning-micromirror system.

Reference-contexts: In other words, the maximum scan angle of this resonant scanner is ~15 (30 optical) if driven on resonance with a sufficiently large ac voltage. This scan angle compares well with typical performance characteristics obtained in bulk resonant scanners available at present <ref> [9] </ref>. FABRICATION use to fabricate the resonant microscanners. On top of the polysilicon ground plane which is common to the electrostatic comb drives, three layers of structural polysilicon (each 2 m m thick) are used to build the armature suspension for the scanning micromirrors.
