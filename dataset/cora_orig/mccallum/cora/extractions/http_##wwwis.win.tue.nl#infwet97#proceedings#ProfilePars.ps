Abstract: In this paper, a natural language approach to Information Retrieval (IR) and Information Filtering (IF) is described. Rather than keywords, noun-phrases are used for both document description and as query language, resulting in a marked improvement of retrieval precision. Recall then can be enhanced by applying normalization to the noun-phrases and some other constructions. This new approach is incorporated in the Information Filtering Project Profile 1 . The overall structure of the Profile project is described, focusing especially on the Parsing Engine involved in the natural language processing. Effectiveness and efficiency issues are elaborated concerning the Parsing Engine. The major contributions of this research include properties of grammars and parsers specialized in IR/IF (properties such as coverage, robustness, efficiency, ambiguity), normalization of noun-phrases, and similarity measures of noun-phrases.

Reference-contexts: The approach described in [SO95] also comprises a natural language processor. Our approach is based on the use of noun phrases (NPs) instead of keywords. For previous work related to the use of NPs in information retrieval, refer to e.g <ref> [AT96] </ref>, [ATK96]. The same linguistic techniques incorporated in Profile can easily be adapted to other information retrieval and filtering systems. In order to solve the problem of accessing natural media like audio or video, the presence of textual annotation of these media is assumed.

Noun phrases can be considered as a semantical unit that is better than text windows. The basic premise is that words found in the same noun phrase tend to share semantic relatedness.

Reference-contexts: Techniques which may be used are under-specification, wild-card and island parsing, latest closure, etc., and the impact of them on effectiveness has to be kept on low levels, minimizing the loss of semantic information. The AGFL 3 (Affix Grammars over a Finite Lattice; <ref> [Kos91] </ref>) system will be employed for the implementation of the parser and transducer. AGFL offers a small, flexible and simple formalism in which large context-free (CF) grammars can be described very efficiently. In AGFL, context-free grammars are augmented with features for expressing agreement between parts of speech.

Reference-contexts: They depend more on linguistic knowledge than stemming techniques. Semantical normalizations demand the use of sophisticated lexica which supply also synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms and other word relations. The WordNet database will be exploited in obtaining these word relations. For more information about WordNet refer to <ref> [MBF + 93] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: A framework for the text filtering problem can be found in <ref> [OM96] </ref>. The state-of-the-art text filtering/retrieval systems are mostly based on use of keywords, both in representing information objects and as a basis for the retrieval language (expressing the information need). The possibility for further improvement in precision and recall based on keywords is rather marginal.

Reference-contexts: The possibility for further improvement in precision and recall based on keywords is rather marginal. Besides, the use of keywords is inadequate for more inflected language than English. Citing C.J. van Rijsbergen <ref> [Rij79] </ref>: "A big question, that has not yet received much attention, concerns the extent to which retrieval effectiveness is limited by the type of document description used. The use of keywords to describe documents has affected the way in which the design of an automatic classification system has been approached.

Reference-contexts: In order to investigate the possibilities, further research must be conducted concerning natural language parsing in relation to normalizing techniques. 4.1 IR/IF Grammar Properties At the start of the project, relatively complete and well-validated grammars for English (ENP4IR, <ref> [Tib96] </ref>) and Dutch (AMAZON) are available. The main research questions are: * Coverage. The coverage of the grammar and lexica will be investigated, that is the ability of the grammar to describe the syntax of English language.
