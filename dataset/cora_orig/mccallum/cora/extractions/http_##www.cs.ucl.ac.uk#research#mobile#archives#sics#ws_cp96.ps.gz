Abstract: As is well known, the frequency allocation problem for mobile telephone networks can be approximated by a graph coloring problem where vertices model transmitters, colors model frequencies, and an edge corresponds to a pair of transmitters that must not use the same frequency. However, the graph coloring analogy doesn't suffice for modeling real world problems, which involve soft constraints and general distance constraints. Thus, general constraint satisfaction techniques are called for. In this paper, we model the frequency allocation problem as a partial constraint satisfaction problem, and give a branch & bound algorithm for solving it. We review a number of constraint solving techniques used in this problem and discuss their relevance to performance.

Reference-contexts: If = fi 1, set b 2b and goto step 2. Otherwise, set b ( + fi)=2c, and goto step 3. While solving the CSP, each constraint maintains arc-consistency over its variables. Both types of constraints (co-cell and inter-cell) are global <ref> [1] </ref> over the variables involved, have special-purpose algorithms for maintaining consistency of their domains, and are invoked whenever one of these domains is pruned.

Reference-contexts: However, the graph coloring analogy doesn't suffice for modeling the full problem, which involves soft constraints and more general distance constraints than disequations. Thus, general constraint satisfaction techniques are called for. An algorithm for automatic allocation of frequency groups was reported in <ref> [4] </ref>, and the effectiveness of constraint lifting and other techniques was evaluated. This algorithm has since been refined to reason about individual frequencies, extended with a number of new techniques not reported in [4], and packaged into a fielded application, Freplan. <p> An algorithm for automatic allocation of frequency groups was reported in <ref> [4] </ref>, and the effectiveness of constraint lifting and other techniques was evaluated.

Reference-contexts: Some frequencies may be preassigned to some cells; others may be forbidden. A minimal separation among frequencies within the same cell is prescribed. The problem is modeled as a partial constraint satisfaction problem (PCSP) <ref> [5] </ref> with variables: f ik , the frequencies to be assigned to each cell i with capacity c i , 1 k c i . domains: The set of available frequencies.

Reference-contexts: ) where s i is the size of the smallest domain of any unassigned variable of the cell i, and d i is the number of active inter-cell constraints attached to i. 4.2 Value choice heuristic When we have selected the next variable to assign, we use the min-conflict heuristic <ref> [6] </ref> to determine the order in which to try the alternative frequencies. The intuition is that the best choice has the smallest impact on the neighborhood.

Reference-contexts: This is a problem, especially as the domain size is fairly large initially. Thus, the first several assignments made are never reconsidered during the backtrack search, unless the backtrack limit is very high. To avoid this problem, we use iterative broadening <ref> [8] </ref>: for any variable, we only consider its w most promising alternative frequencies (as determined by the value choice heuristic), where w is a parameter of the search. This ensures that the search space is explored more fairly.

Reference-contexts: We use a variant of Matula's smallest-last ordering <ref> [10] </ref> for this purpose. Furthermore, during the search, we may detect that a cell i with a single unassigned variable is attached to another such cell via an inter-cell constraint, or to none at all.

This observation was first made by Pennotti <ref> [11] </ref> who introduced the concepts micrograph (constraints on frequency pairs) and macrograph (constraints on cell pairs). Typically, the soft constraints are derived from geographic data, electromagnetic propagation data (measured or simulated), heuristic rules, or a combination of these.

Reference-contexts: For each CSP, we examine the constraint graph and extract such cliques, replacing the binary constraints they subsume by single all_different constraints denoting pairwise disequations between all variables involved. We use Regin's complete algorithm <ref> [12] </ref> for maintaining consistency. This transformation has the advantages of 1. reducing the number of constraints engaged in propagation, and 2. increasing propagation power. The clique extraction is done using a greedy algorithm.
