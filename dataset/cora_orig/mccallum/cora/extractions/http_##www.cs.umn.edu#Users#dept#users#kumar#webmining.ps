Abstract: Web-based organizations often generate and collect large volumes of data in their daily operations. Analyzing such data can help these organizations to determine the life time value of clients, design cross marketing strategies across products and services, evaluate the effectiveness of promotional campaigns, and find the most effective logical structure for their Web space. This type of analysis involves the discovery of meaningful relationships from a large collection of primarily unstructured data, often stored in Web server access logs. We propose a framework for Web mining, the applications of data mining and knowledge discovery techniques to data collected in World Wide Web transactions. We present data and transaction models for various Web mining tasks such as the discovery of association rules and sequential patterns from the Web data. We also present a Web mining system, WEBMINER, which has been implemented based upon the proposed framework, and discuss our experimental results on real-world Web data using the WEBMINER.

Reference-contexts: There are a variety of data mining techniques that have been proposed, including, clustering [KR90, Fis95, NH94], classification [HKS + 96, MAR96, CS96, HCC93, WK91], discovery of association rules <ref> [AS94, HS95, SON95, SA95] </ref>, and discovery of sequential patterns [MTV95, SA96]. Recently, several researchers have proposed the application of data mining techniques to facilitate information discovery on global information systems such as the Internet [ZH95, KKS96]. <p> In the following, we briefly discuss each of these techniques and what they mean in the context of Web mining. 2.1 Discovering Association Rules The association rule discovery techniques <ref> [AS94, HS95, SON95, SA95] </ref> are generally applied to databases of transactions where each transaction consists of a set of items. <p> C k = apiori gen (L k1 ); // New Candidates 4. get count (C k ) 5. L k = fc 2 C k j c.count minsupg 6. end 7. Answer = S ation rules, henceforth referred to as the apriori algorithm was presented in <ref> [AS94] </ref>. We have used the same algorithm. Following the same notation, a large itemset refers to the itemsets satisfying the minimum support requirement. Figure 2 depicts the algorithm. <p> Then, we gather the itemsets which are above the minimum support. A hash tree has been used for implementing the get count function. For details of this algorithm , please refer to <ref> [AS94] </ref>. 4.1.2 Sequential Patterns In the implementation of WEBMINER, the time gap defining transactions for sequential patterns, defined in section 3.3, is taken to be zero. Thus, UT-sequences are made up of singleton sets of items and each item is a URL accessed by a client in a transaction. <p> For example, a transaction consisting of URLs ABCD in that order contains BC as an subsequence, but does not contain CB. So, all permutations have to be generated. This is even more computationally intensive than generating all combinations which has already been reported to be difficult <ref> [AS94] </ref>. For getting around this problem, we have changed the joining criteria itself. Instead of matching the first k-1 elements of two k-itemsets, we match the last k-1 elements of the first k-itemset with the first k-1 elements of the second k-itemset.

Reference-contexts: Data mining [FPSM91, MCPS93, FPSS96] is the process of extracting valid and interesting relationships from large collections of data using AI or statistical techniques. There are a variety of data mining techniques that have been proposed, including, clustering [KR90, Fis95, NH94], classification <ref> [HKS + 96, MAR96, CS96, HCC93, WK91] </ref>, discovery of association rules [AS94, HS95, SON95, SA95], and discovery of sequential patterns [MTV95, SA96]. Recently, several researchers have proposed the application of data mining techniques to facilitate information discovery on global information systems such as the Internet [ZH95, KKS96]. <p> access logs allows Web-based organizations to predict user visit patterns and helps in targeting advertising aimed at groups of users based on these patterns. 2.3 Classification and Clustering Another common data mining technique involves the discovery of hidden common patterns among data items and their classification according to these patterns <ref> [MAR96, CS96, HCC93, WK91] </ref>. Classification allows one to develop a profile for items belonging to a particular group according to their common attributes. This profile can then be used to classify new data items that are added - 5 - to the database.

Reference-contexts: The query based on these parameters can be expressed as follows: SELECT association-rules (A*B*C*) FROM log.data WHERE date 960101 AND domain = edu AND support = 1.0 AND confidence = 90.0 4.2.2 Query Optimization Issues Query Optimization <ref> [EN94] </ref> has been a traditional problem in all databases. A query typically has many execution strategies, and the problem is to choose a suitable one out of them. The use of query optimization can speedup the process of finding the patterns in many ways.

Reference-contexts: Relational databases owe much of their success to the existence of powerful query language. The emerging data mining tools and systems lead naturally to the demand for a powerful data mining query language, on top of which many interactive and flexible graphical user interfaces can be developed <ref> [HFW + 96] </ref>. Most of the conventional query languages are constrained by a schema, but in our case, the data model does not fall in this category.

Reference-contexts: Finally, for organizations that sell advertising on the World Wide Web, analyzing user access patterns helps in targeting ads to specific groups of users. Most of the existing Web analysis tools <ref> [Inc96, eSI95, net96] </ref> provide mechanisms for reporting user activity in the servers and various forms of data filtering. <p> This includes information available on the client side in the history files, cookie files, etc. Other methods used to obtain profile and demographic information on clients include user registration, online survey forms, and techniques such as "anonymous ticketing" <ref> [Inc96] </ref>. Furthermore, obtaining profile information on clients and discovering classifications of data items (server files), allows one to group together clients or data items that have similar characteristics. In data mining this kind of activity is referred to as clustering [KR90, Fis95, NH94]. <p> These additional attributes come from user registration, online survey forms, and techniques such as "anonymous ticketing" <ref> [Inc96] </ref>. The classes for the transactions are the clustering determined from the clustering task. 4 Implementation In this section we describe the implementation of WEBMINER, a Web mining system based on the framework presented in the previous sections.

Reference-contexts: Each user's transaction, defined in terms of sequential patterns, will be examined to see if it contains the rules. The clusters determined during this process can then be used as the basis for the discovery of classification rules using algorithms such as C4:5 <ref> [Qui93] </ref> on decision trees. The query mechanism in WEBMINER will also be extended to include clustering and classification constraints. One important area of future work involves the analysis of discovered rules to provide meaningful courses of action to users.

Reference-contexts: There are a variety of data mining techniques that have been proposed, including, clustering [KR90, Fis95, NH94], classification [HKS + 96, MAR96, CS96, HCC93, WK91], discovery of association rules <ref> [AS94, HS95, SON95, SA95] </ref>, and discovery of sequential patterns [MTV95, SA96]. Recently, several researchers have proposed the application of data mining techniques to facilitate information discovery on global information systems such as the Internet [ZH95, KKS96]. <p> In the following, we briefly discuss each of these techniques and what they mean in the context of Web mining. 2.1 Discovering Association Rules The association rule discovery techniques <ref> [AS94, HS95, SON95, SA95] </ref> are generally applied to databases of transactions where each transaction consists of a set of items.

Reference-contexts: Data mining [FPSM91, MCPS93, FPSS96] is the process of extracting valid and interesting relationships from large collections of data using AI or statistical techniques. There are a variety of data mining techniques that have been proposed, including, clustering [KR90, Fis95, NH94], classification <ref> [HKS + 96, MAR96, CS96, HCC93, WK91] </ref>, discovery of association rules [AS94, HS95, SON95, SA95], and discovery of sequential patterns [MTV95, SA96]. Recently, several researchers have proposed the application of data mining techniques to facilitate information discovery on global information systems such as the Internet [ZH95, KKS96]. <p> access logs allows Web-based organizations to predict user visit patterns and helps in targeting advertising aimed at groups of users based on these patterns. 2.3 Classification and Clustering Another common data mining technique involves the discovery of hidden common patterns among data items and their classification according to these patterns <ref> [MAR96, CS96, HCC93, WK91] </ref>. Classification allows one to develop a profile for items belonging to a particular group according to their common attributes. This profile can then be used to classify new data items that are added - 5 - to the database.
