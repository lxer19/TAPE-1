Abstract: This paper describes an experiment undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of inline substitution as a method of improving the running time of compiled code. Our particular interests are in the interaction between inline substitution and aggressive code optimization. To understand this relationship, we used commercially available FORTRAN optimizing compilers as the basis for our study. This paper reports on the effectiveness of the various compilers at optimizing the inlined code. We examine both the run-time performance of the resulting code and the compile-time performance of the compilers. This work can be viewed as a study of the effectiveness of inlining in modern optimizers; alternatively, it can be viewed as one data point on the overall effectiveness of modern optimizing compilers. We discovered that, with optimizing FORTRAN compilers, (1) object-code growth from inlining is substantially smaller than source-code growth, (2) compile-time growth from inlining is smaller than source-code growth, and (3) the compilers we tested were not able to capitalize consistently on the opportunities presented by inlining.
