Abstract: This report describes a corpus of task-oriented dialogues set in the Trains domain. A user collaborates with a planning assistant to accomplish some task involving manufacturing and shipping goods in a railroad freight system. We include a description of the task, collection situation, and transcriptions conventions. The audio files, along with time-aligned word and phoneme transcriptions are available on CD-ROM from the Linguistic Data Consortium. Altogether, there are 98 dialogs included, collected using 20 different tasks and 34 different speakers. This amounts to six and a half hours of speech, about 5900 speaker turns, and 55000 transcribed words.

Reference-contexts: Hence, our corpus allows researchers to examine language usage during collorative domain-planning|an area where human-computer dialogues will be very useful. 2 Overview of the Trains Project The Trains project is a long-term research project to develop an intelligent planning assistant that is conversationally proficient in natural language <ref> (Allen et al., 1995) </ref>. In particular, the Trains agent helps a person (the manager) construct and monitor plans about a railroad freight system. <p> These guidelines are taken from our technical note on dialogue transcription tools <ref> (Heeman and Allen, 1995) </ref>, in which we also give worked examples, and describe tools that assist in this process. For the first pass, we made use of an automatic tool that segmented by silences. <p> In the tools subdirectory on the CD-ROM is a toolkit for managing such a segmentation. This toolkit makes use of Waves, and is described in a technical note <ref> (Heeman and Allen, 1995) </ref> included in the docs subdirectory. The program expanddialog, which makes use of the toolkit, can be used to create the utterance segmentation from the CD-ROM dialogue.

Reference-contexts: Also, even for phenomena that do occur in single speaker utterances, such as speech repairs, our corpus allows the interactions with other dialogue phenomena to be examined. In comparison to the HCRC Map Task corpus <ref> (Anderson et al., 1991) </ref>, ours is also unique. The map task involves one agent trying to explain his route to another agent. Our domain involves two agents working together to construct a plan that solves some stated goal.

Reference-contexts: These dialogues have been extensively used in our work on plan-based dialogue models and speech acts (e.g., Traum and Hinkelman, 1992), on discourse models for handling co-reference and scoping <ref> (e.g., Poesio, 1992) </ref>, on detecting and correcting speech repairs (e.g., Heeman and Allen, 1994), and on other parts of the Trains project. Here are a few examples of how we have used, or are planning to use the data. * parsing spontaneous dialogue.
