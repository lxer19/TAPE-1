Title: Experience With a Learning Personal Assistant

Abstract: 2 Abstract Personal software assistants that help users with tasks like finding information, scheduling calendars, or managing work-flow will require significant customization to each individual user. For example, an assistant that helps schedule a particular user's calendar will have to know that user's scheduling preferences. This paper explores the potential of machine learning methods to automatically create and maintain such customized knowledge for personal software assistants. We describe the design of one particular learning assistant: a calendar manager, called CAP (Calendar APprentice), that learns user scheduling preferences from experience. Results are summarized from approximately five user-years of experience, during which CAP has learned an evolving set of several thousand rules that characterize the scheduling preferences of its users. Based on this experience, we suggest that machine learning methods may play an important role in future personal software assistants.
