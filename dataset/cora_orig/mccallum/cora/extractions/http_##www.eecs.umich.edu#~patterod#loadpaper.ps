Abstract: Real-time, in-situ control of reactive ion etching is shown to reduce loading disturbance in an Applied 8300 reactive ion etch system. The etch process vehicle is CF 4 etching of polysilicon. A real-time, multivariable feedback control strategy where key plasma parameters are fed back has been developed. This strategy is experimentally compared with standard industry practice and is shown to reduce the loading effect by 80%. This quantification of improvement is carried out in terms of a model from the literature which is reviewed and experimentally validated for the etch equipment and process used.

Reference-contexts: Reactive ion etching (RIE) is one of the key process steps that is repeated numerous times during the fabrication of a device. Our group at the University of Michigan is applying multivariable feedback control to the RIE process in order to reduce the variance in select etch characteristics <ref> [1] </ref>. Results from related efforts at other institutions on the control of semiconductor manufacturing can be found in the literature [2-7]. Important characteristics of the etch process include: etch depth, sidewall profile, surface roughness, selectivity, etch rate, and etch depth uniformity across the wafer surface. <p> An electrode may be constructed out of the material being etched. The load would then be relatively constant as wafers would only be a small proportion of the load. This solution would severely reduce the throughput of the system. 2 In an earlier work <ref> [1] </ref>, some data was presented which favorably compared multivariable feedback control to conventional control with respect to loading effect; however, since only four etches were conducted, the results are limited by measurement error. <p> The RIE process can be conceptually decomposed into two sub-processes, the Plasma Generation Process (PGP) and the Wafer Etch Process (WEP) as shown in Fig. 1 <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For instance, during fabrication of a transistor gate region, a polysilicon layer is etched down to a thin gate oxide. Selectivity to the oxide is of primary importance since only a small variation in the oxide layer is tolerable. The other key requirement is critical dimension control <ref> [8] </ref>. Design of experiments (DOE) can be used to locate an operating point which 1 offers good performance in the characteristics of most importance while maintain-ing adequate performance in the characteristics of secondary interest [9]. Models generated from the DOE data are used to achieve this goal.

The RIE system is susceptible to disturbances which increase the variance of the output characteristics regardless of the operating point selected.

Reference-contexts: Typically when the load is increased the etch rate decreases. This phenomenon is commonly known as the loading effect <ref> [10] </ref>. The loading effect is known to be significant in certain etch chemistries such as fluorine etching of silicon. An excellent physical model describing the loading effect exists which facilitates quantification of the reduction in loading effect [11]. <p> Consequently, the process yield may be reduced and costly trial runs are necessary to establish the proper etch time for new loads. A number of procedures are discussed by Wolf and Tauber <ref> [10] </ref> for reducing the loading effect. The chamber size or gas flow may be increased, although the increase would need to be quite dramatic to make much difference. An electrode may be constructed out of the material being etched. <p> Similar results are expected for fluorine etching of silicon dioxide (oxide), however for chlorine based chemistries, the loading effect is reported to be negligible <ref> [10] </ref> and multivariable feedback control would be used for other purposes. The benefits of multivariable feedback control are further reaching than demonstrated by the results in this paper. Though only reduction in the etch depth variance is discussed, similar benefits are anticipated for other etch characteristics.

Reference-contexts: This phenomenon is commonly known as the loading effect [10]. The loading effect is known to be significant in certain etch chemistries such as fluorine etching of silicon. An excellent physical model describing the loading effect exists which facilitates quantification of the reduction in loading effect <ref> [11] </ref>. Although multivariable feedback control reduces the loading effect, it is not a method for reducing the microloading effect, a related phenomenon where local variations in the pattern density cause local variations in the etch rate. <p> Results Loading Effect Model A simple physical model of the loading effect for a radial configuration reactor was developed by Mogab and Flamm <ref> [11, 18] </ref>. We will show that the experimental data from the Applied 8300 hexode reactor fits this model extremely well. The Mogab-Flamm model is based on a balance equation for the dominant etchant species which in this case is fluorine.

Reference-contexts: This is because available sensors and actuators address the bulk characteristics of the plasma and not local phenomena. Instead, the use of DOE is appropriate <ref> [12] </ref>. Loading effect is undesirable because it is a source of variance in the etch rate. Because of the variance in the etch rate, selection of the appropriate etch time is difficult.

Reference-contexts: The etch rate may be calculated from the HeNe reflectometer data using peak valley subtraction. The white light data, which includes the data for 50 different wavelengths, provides a more accurate estimate of etch rate though not in real-time and only with a great deal more computation <ref> [13] </ref>. Data from both the HeNe and white light reflectometers was collected for the experiments in this paper. Actinometry is used to sense [F] where 5% Argon is used as the tracer gas. <p> Note that the optical fiber is not pointed at a sample since the reflection of the changing sample would introduce a periodic error into the [F] measurement. Further details on this sensor can be found in <ref> [13] </ref>. Despite the natural robustness of actinometry, some drift in the sensor does occur over long periods due to variation in the position of the fluorine and argon lines and in the intensities of these lines for a standard plasma relative to each 5 other.

Reference-contexts: To compensate for this drift, a calibration routine was developed where the monochromators are compared at the fluorine and argon wavelengths and their relative strengths are recorded <ref> [16] </ref>. The ratio of these two intensities is termed the optical gain and is incorporated into the actinometry equation used to determine [F]. Although a thorough long term study has not been conducted, we believe this procedure will allow successful application of plasma system control to a production line.

Reference-contexts: The reason behind this is as follows: The etch rate under the conventional control mode of operation changes throughout the etch due to the water vapor disturbance as shown in Fig. 2 <ref> [17] </ref>. The impact of this disturbance is much less over the second half of the etch in comparison to the first half.
