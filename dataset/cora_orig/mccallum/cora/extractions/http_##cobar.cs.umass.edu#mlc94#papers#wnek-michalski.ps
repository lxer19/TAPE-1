Title: Discovering Representation Space Transformations for Learning Concept Descriptions Combining DNF and M-of-N Rules

Abstract: This paper addresses a class of learning problems that require a construction of descriptions that combine both M-of-N rules and traditional Disjunctive Normal form (DNF) rules. The presented method learns such descriptions, which we call conditional M-of-N rules, using the hypothesis-driven constructive induction approach. In this approach, the representation space is modified according to patterns discovered in the iteratively generated hypotheses. The need for the M-of-N rules is detected by observing "exclusive-or" or "equivalence" patterns in the hypotheses. These patterns indicate symmetry relations among pairs of attributes. Symmetrical attributes are combined into maximal symmetry classes. For each symmetry class, the method constructs a "counting attribute" that adds a new dimension to the representation space. The search for hypothesis in iteratively modified representation spaces is done by the standard AQ inductive rule learning algorithm. It is shown that the proposed method is capable of solving problems that would be very difficult to tackle by any of the traditional symbolic learning methods.

Reference-contexts: The idea of "counting attributes" and "counting arguments rule" is related to research on detecting symmetry in Boolean functions of many variables (Michalski, 1969; 1983), and implementation of SYM programs <ref> (Jensen, 1975) </ref>. More recently, Fawcett and Utgoff (1991) used counting attributes to expand representation space by summing up the number of distinct values of the set of variables that can satisfy a set of conditions. So modified representation allows expressing a "number of ways" in which conditions can be satisfied.

Reference-contexts: In such cases, data can be a source for finding these patterns. In the case of the AQ learning method that uses the VL1 representational formalism (a form of propositional calculus), class-patterns can be detected both in data and hypotheses. An initial examination of descriptions generated by FOIL <ref> (Quinlan, 1990) </ref> indicates that they also contain XOR-patterns.

Reference-contexts: The introduced "counting attribute" captures a conceptual transition from logic to arithmetic. This work was inspired by the failure of well-known symbolic learning systems in solving the M O N K 2 problem used in an international competition of learning programs <ref> (Thrun et al, 1991) </ref>. The MONK2 problem was to learn the concept, "exactly two of the six attributes have their first value," which is a special case of the M-of-N concept. There have been several efforts concerned with learning M-of-N concepts. <p> The data contains no noise. 3 . 1 LEARNING IN THE ORIGINAL REPRESENTATION SPACE MONK2 problem is hard for symbolic learning systems. In fact, none of the 18 symbolic learners taking part in the international competition learned the MONK2 concept <ref> (Thrun et al., 1991) </ref>. This problem is also hard for the AQ15 program.

Reference-contexts: Each instance in the new space represents from 1 to 24 instances that were mapped from the original space. The transformation does not cause ambiguity in the new representation space, i.e., each new instance represents instances of the same class, either positive or negative. For more details see <ref> (Wnek, 1993) </ref>. In this representation space, all possible positive examples are present, and only 13 negative examples are missing (in the original space only 64 positive examples out of 142 are present). It seems that learning should give better results.

Reference-contexts: A rule-pattern is a rule or a subset of rules. Detecting such patterns and using them for expanding the representation space has shown to be effective in improving performance accuracy in DNF-type problems <ref> (Wnek & Michalski, 1994b) </ref>. Following the scheme of different types of patterns, it was conjectured that there may exist class-patterns. Such patterns would represent relations that are common for subsets of learned classes (concepts). The XOR-patterns satisfy this definition.
