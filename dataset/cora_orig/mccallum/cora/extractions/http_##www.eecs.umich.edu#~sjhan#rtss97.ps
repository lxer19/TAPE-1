Title: Efficient Spare-Resource Allocation for Fast Restoration of Real-Time Channels from Network Component Failures

Abstract: Since real-time applications usually require not only timeliness but also fault-tolerance, it is essential to incorporate fault-tolerance into real-time communication services that are indispensable to distributed real-time applications. The techniques for failure recovery in datagram communication are not adequate for real-time communication, because they cannot provide recovery-delay guarantees. To ensure fast recovery of a real-time channel from network component failures, we need to reserve network resources (called "spare resources") along a backup route before failures actually occur. The focus of this paper is on minimizing the amount of spare resources while meeting the fault-tolerance requirement. Specifically, we present resource sharing mechanisms and backup-route selection algorithms, and evaluate their efficiency with extensive simulations.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we do not consider the forward-recovery approach, but focus on the alternative approach mentioned above. The simplest way of recovering from a disabled real-time channel is to establish a new real-time channel which does not use the failed components. This reactive method is studied in <ref> [4] </ref>. Despite its low overhead in the absence of failures, it does not guarantee successful recovery, because the channel re-establishment attempt can fail due to resource shortage at that time.

Reference-contexts: Even when there are sufficient resources, contention among simultaneous recovery attempts for different disabled channels may require several trials to succeed, thus delaying service resumption and increasing network traffic. To avoid/minimize resource shortage during failure recovery, one can reserve spare resources. The scheme proposed in <ref> [5] </ref> follows this concept; spare resources in the vicinity of the faulty components are utilized to reroute the disabled channels. Similar schemes [6-8] have been developed for reliable telecommunication service, which has resemblance to real-time communication in packet-switched networks such as dedicated resources and static routing.

Reference-contexts: End-to-end detouring solves this problem, which requires about 30% less spare resources than the local-detouring approach in mesh networks <ref> [9, 10] </ref>. In this approach, a backup channel is established between two end-points of each real-time channel (i.e., a primary channel ), and the backup channel takes over the primary channel's role in case of failure to the primary.

(See <ref> [14] </ref> for the derivation.) Based on this probability, the set of backups to be multiplexed together is determined for each backup on a link. B i and B j are multiplexed if S (B i ; B j ) is smaller than a certain threshold , called the multiplexing degree.

Reference-contexts: This type of backup multiplexing is possible only when resource reservation is completely interchangeable among channels. However, this condition does not hold for all real-time channel schemes, but in general it is valid only for `rate-based' schemes, not for `scheduler-based' schemes (we borrowed this classification from <ref> [15] </ref>). In the rate-based schemes [16, 17], QoS has a static relation with the traffic characteristics. For example, a higher message rate (hence, higher bandwidth) results in a smaller message delay.

Reference-contexts: For example, a higher message rate (hence, higher bandwidth) results in a smaller message delay. In these schemes, the admission test at a link simply examines whether the demanded resources exceed the available resources, since the amount of resources determines the QoS level. By contrast, in the scheduler-based schemes <ref> [18, 19] </ref>, the delay requirement of a channel can be specified independently of its traffic characteristics. In such schemes, the admission test checks for the schedulabil-ity of a channel by deriving a feasible priority assignment to meet its delay requirement while considering the worst-case contention with existing channels.

Reference-contexts: If network topology information is maintained at each node, a path can be found without broadcasting route-search messages. Recently, more elaborate routing algorithms have been developed, such as those in [20-22]. For instance, in [21], a smallest-delay path, instead of a minimum-hop path, is selected. In <ref> [20] </ref>, a smallest-delay path is selected among minimum-hop paths. Another popular metric of QoS routing is the residual bandwidth, so as to favor a path with larger available bandwidth. The algorithm presented in [22] uses a metric which aggregates multiple routing parameters such as throughput, delay, and error rate.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, there doesn't exist any efficient algorithm for `optimally' routing backup channels; the problem of finding a path set with multiple constraints is known to be NP-complete.

The backup route-selection problem is therefore NP-complete, even without considering backup multiplexing.
