Title: Description Logics with Transitive Roles  
Author: Ian Horrocks and Graham Gough 
Address: Manchester  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of  
Abstract: This paper describes the logic ALCH R + , which extends ALC R + with a primitive role hierarchy, and presents an appropriate extension to the ALC R + satisfiability testing algorithm. ALCH R + is of interest because it provides useful additional expressive power and, although its satisfiability problem is Exptime-complete, the algorithm is relatively simple and is amenable to optimisation.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The importance of transitively closed roles in Description Logics (DLs) has long been recognised [PL94], particularly in domains which are concerned with physically composed objects, for example in medicine [HRG96] and engineering [Sat95]. The logic ALC + <ref> [Baa90] </ref> supports complete reasoning about roles and their transitive closures by extending ALC [SSS91] with union, composition and transitive closure role forming operators but, unfortunately, has a satisfiability problem which is Ex-ptime-complete. <p> It can, for example, represent a role such as ancestor with the expression parent + , capturing the knowledge that ancestor is exactly equal to the transitive closure of parent. Unlike ALC , ALCH R + 's role hierarchy also enables internalisation <ref> [Baa90] </ref> to be used to test satisfiabil-ity w.r.t. a terminology T which contains a set of general concept inclusion axioms (GCIs). <p> The algorithm for ALCH R + on the other hand does not need to consider role expressions, and cycle detection is straightforward as all cycles lead to valid 1 A relatively efficient mechanism for dealing with this problem using finite state automata is suggested in <ref> [Baa90] </ref>. models.
