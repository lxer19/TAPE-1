Abstract: This is the second edition of the operating manual for gosset, a flexible and powerful computer program for constructing experimental designs. Many new features have been added. Variables may be discrete or continuous (or both), discrete variables may be numeric or symbolic (or both), and continuous variables may range over a cube or a ball (or both). The variables may be required to satisfy linear equalities or inequalities, and the model to be fitted may be any low degree polynomial (e.g. a quadratic). The number of observations is specified by the user. The design may be required to include a specified set of points (so a sequence of designs can be found, each of which is optimal given that the earlier measurements have been made). The region where the model is to be fitted need not be the same as the region where measurements are to be made (so the designs can be used for interpolation or extrapolation). The following types of designs can be requested: I-, A-, D- or E-optimal; the same but with protection against the loss of one run; or pack-ings (when no model is available). Block designs, and designs with correlated errors can also be constructed. The algorithm is powerful enough to routinely minimize functions of 1000 variables (e.g. can find optimal or nearly optimal designs for a quadratic model involving 12 variables). An extensive library of precomputed optimal designs is included for linear and quadratic designs in the cube, ball and simplex.
