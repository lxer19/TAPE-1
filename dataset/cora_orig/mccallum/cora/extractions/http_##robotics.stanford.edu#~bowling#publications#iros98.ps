Title: The Motion Isotropy Hypersurface: A Characterization of Acceleration Capability  
Author: Alan Bowling and Oussama Khatib 
Address: Stanford, CA, USA 94305  
Affiliation: Robotics Laboratory Computer Science Department Stanford University  
Abstract: The study of acceleration capability is concerned with the responsiveness of a manipulator to controller commands. In this paper we present a general model for the analysis of end-effector linear and angular accelerations that accounts for the velocity effects. The separate treatment of linear and angular motion directly addresses the inhomogeneities of end-effector motions, avoiding the use of indeterminate scaling factors. The velocity effects considered are the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, as well as the relationships associated with actuator's speed-torque performance curves. This study results in a characterization referred to as the "motion isotropy hypersurface" which describes the relationships between isotropic end-effector linear and angular velocities and accelerations. The utility of this surface and its associated information is demonstrated in a design application involving the PUMA 560 manipulator.

Reference-contexts: The kinematic studies focused on the analysis of the Ja-cobian matrix. Proposed kinematic measures include the Jacobian condition number [10, 16], manipulability measure [18, 20], and norm of the Jacobian rate of change [15]. In dynamic analyses, the proposed measures and characterizations include the generalized inertia ellipsoid <ref> [1] </ref>, the end-effector mass matrix [6], dynamic manipulability ellipsoid [19, 21], dynamic conditioning index [12], acceleration set theory [8, 9], isotropic acceleration radius [5], acceleration hy-perparallelipiped [7], and other measures discussed in [11, 13, 14, 22].

Reference-contexts: The utility of this analysis is demonstrated through a design application involving the PUMA 560 manipulator. 2 Model In this section the equations describing the motion isotropy hypersurface for a non-redundant manipulator are developed. A more extensive discussion is presented in <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> These measures also reduce the necessity for actually generating the hypersurface, by summarizing the features discussed above. However, due to space limitations, they will not be presented here. A complete description of them can be found in <ref> [2] </ref> and will be presented in a later article. 5 Conclusion The motion isotropy hypersurface presented in this paper provides a characterization of the end-effector isotropic acceleration capabilities at a given configuration. By addressing the inhomogeneity problem, this approach allows full analyses of linear and angular accelerations and velocities. <p> The motion isotropy hypersurface also provides a physically meaningful worst-case analysis of the end-effector motions. These models have been extended to redundant manipulators [4]. The analysis of end-effector force capability can also be included in these models <ref> [2] </ref>. 6 Acknowledgments The financial support of NASA/JPL, Boeing, Hi-tachi Construction Machinery, and NSF, grant IRI-9320017, are gratefully acknowledged.
