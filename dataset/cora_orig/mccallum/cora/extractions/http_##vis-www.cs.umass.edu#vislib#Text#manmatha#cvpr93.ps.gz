Abstract: Image deformations due to relative motion between an observer and an object may be used to infer 3-D structure. Up to first order these deformations can be written in terms of an affine transform. Here, a novel approach is adopted to measuring affine transforms which correctly handles the problem of corresponding deformed patches. The patches are filtered using gaussians and derivatives of gaussians and the filters deformed according to the affine transform. The problem of finding the affine transform is therefore reduced to that of finding the appropriate deformed filter to use. In the special case where the affine transform can be written as a scale change and an in-plane rotation, the gaussian and first derivative equations have been solved for the scale. This case arises frequently in robot navigation. The robustness of the method has been demonstrated experimentally.

Reference-contexts: Deformations can be used to infer local surface geometry and depth from motion. Since a repeating texture pattern can be thought of as a pattern in motion, shape from texture can also be derived from deformations <ref> [1] </ref>. Up to first order, there are four kinds of image deformations a scale change, rotation in the image plane and shear along the x and y axes. The position of the surface's projection in the image also changes with motion. <p> Thus the problem is more difficult than in standard correspondence problems e.g. the determination of optical flow. Existing methods usually ignore this problem. 1.1 Previous Work Affine transforms between image patches have been recovered in three different ways (for more details see <ref> [1] </ref>): 1. By linearizing the image intensities or the filter outputs with respect to the image coordinates. Linearization limits these algorithms to cases when the affine transforms are small. 2. Matching image intensities by searching through the space of all affine parameters. <p> However, it is limited to homogenous regions with closed boundaries. The rest of this paper assumes that the translation is already known or has been recovered (say using a traditional flow algorithm). For another approach to recovering translation, see <ref> [1] </ref>. 2 Deformation of Filters By applying deformed filters, the problem of corresponding deformed image patches is converted to the simpler problem of finding the appropriate deformed filter to use. <p> F 1 fl G (:; ) = F 2 fl G (:; s); (3) where G (:; ) denotes a gaussian with standard deviation , and * denotes a convolution at the origin (for a proof of this statement and a straightforward extension to arbitrary affine transforms see <ref> [1] </ref>). Intuitively, this equation implies that the gaussian-weighted brightnesses of the two patches must be equal. Note that in equation (3) only the scale s appears since the gaussian is rotationally invariant. <p> Equation (6) is not very stable if solved at a single scale. By using gaussians at several different scales i an overconstrained linear system is obtained which can be solved using singular value decomposition (for details see <ref> [1] </ref>). It should be emphasized that the equations at several scales are solved simultaneously rather than in a coarse to fine approach. The method differs from other linearization methods in that it linearizes with respect to rather than the image coordinates r. <p> The advantage of doing so is that the linearization point can be shifted (i.e the right-hand side of (6) can be linearized with respect to a different from the one on the left-hand side - see <ref> [1] </ref> for specifics). The correct linearization point is recovered by consistency checking. This allows affine deformations of arbitrary size to be dealt with. 3.1 Experiments In implementations, filters at 5 different scales were used. <p> The resulting equations are no longer linear in ff and are solved using the Gauss-Newton technique <ref> [1] </ref>. Having solved for scale, the rotation is then recovered. Again, the method gives good results.
