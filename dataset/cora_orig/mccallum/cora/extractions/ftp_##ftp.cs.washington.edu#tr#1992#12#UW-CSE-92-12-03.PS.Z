Reference-contexts: It is the cycle time for a theoretical router representing the fastest possible router based on the limitations induced by the synchronous controller. The cycle time is based primarily on pad, latch and interconnect delays. The latch delays are approximate, the pad delays come from the Seattle Silicon Databook <ref> [3] </ref>.
