Abstract: There is no theoretical roadblock obstructing the int e-gration of different media types into a single digital mediumafter all, bits are bits but there are several real problems hindering the socalled digital conve r-gence. The alpha problem is that between premultiplied and non-premultiplied alpha. The gamma problem co n-cerns the nonlinearity that many of to day's applications insist on burning into their image data. The delta pro b-lem is about the integration of the discrete and the co n-tinuouseg, samples (pixels) and geometry. The su b-tleties of these are explored eg, "square pixels" and non-rectangular imagesand a current example of how wrong things can get the US digital television trans Any creative person utilizing the various forms of digital media today knows the nightmare resulting from one or more applications per media type plus file co n-versions between them. For example, a project might require a 3D modeling program, a 2D paint program, a 3D rendering program, a 2D drawing program, a sound program, an editing program, etc. Since these have historically risen as separate applications, created by distinct companies, or distinct groups within a company, they do not naturally know about one another, neces i-tating file conversions and other energy losses to mere friction. the model possible. Alpha ( D D ) The concept of the integral alpha channeleg, a fourth channel integral to each image pixel in addition to its red, green, and blue color channels has been with the computer graphics community since 197 7 [4]. This simple idea was augmented by the notion of premulti-plied and non-premultiplied alph a in 1984 [ 2]. Neither it nor the notion of integral alpha were appreciated by their inventors for the ramifications implied.
