Abstract: The problem of feedback linearization of nonlinear systems in the presence of input saturation is considered in this paper. Although different approaches for stabilization of linear and nonlinear systems under bounded controls have been suggested in the literature, the need to perform output tracking for nonlinear systems dictates the choice of feedback linearization in our control design. This method results in linear error dynamics allowing the estimation of the convergence rate. Explicit characterization of the space of feasible trajectories that can be tracked using bounded inputs is provided followed by simulation results.

Reference-contexts: Thus actuator constraints must be taken into account while planning the reference trajectory. If the aircraft encounters severe disturbances, the actuators might saturate requiring an on-line replanning of the reference trajectory. All these are essential elements of the automated air traffic management system (ATMS) proposed by NASA <ref> [1] </ref>. Although the geometric theory of feedback linearization is fully developed, its applicability in the presence of control constraints has not received much attention. Input-output linearization is also closely related to tracking of reference trajectories by the outputs of a nonlinear system. <p> Increasing the amplitude of the desired sinusoid to A = 4 results in the desired trajectory crossing out of U x , as shown in Figure 4. Therefore, this sinusoid is not a feasible one. The initial condition <ref> [1; 2] </ref> T results in the state trajectory of Figure 4. Notice that initially, since the state lies in U x , then the actual trajectory actually converges to the desired one.

Reference-contexts: The dynamics have been made unobservable by the feedback law (5). The input v is then designed so as to achieve the goals of stabilization and reference trajectory tracking. An extensive treatment of feedback linearization may be found in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2.2 Stabilization under Input Constraints We are interested in stabilizing initial conditions x (0) 2 X to the origin of system (1), _x = f (x) + g (x)u where the control input u is constrained to lie in the following set, juj M; M &gt; 0 (7) 2.2.1 Without <p> Unfortunately, except in the very rare circumstances when the distribution (x) = span [g 1 ; ; g m ](x) is involutive (see <ref> [2] </ref>), the equation for the dynamics depends explicitly on the input u. _ = Q (z; ) + P (z; )u Looking at the analysis of the previous section, the explicit dependence of (t) on z and u will restrict the space of trajectories even further. <p> The parameter values chosen where M = 28, ! = 2, = 0:7, A = 1, c 1 = 3 ,c 2 = 2 and the initial condition was <ref> [2; 2] </ref> T . Figures 2 and 3 show the results of this simulation. The boundary of U x is shown by dashed-dotted lines in Figure 2. Notice that the initial condition as well as the reference trajectory (dashed circle) lie completely inside U x . <p> Increasing the amplitude of the desired sinusoid to A = 4 results in the desired trajectory crossing out of U x , as shown in Figure 4. Therefore, this sinusoid is not a feasible one. The initial condition <ref> [1; 2] </ref> T results in the state trajectory of Figure 4. Notice that initially, since the state lies in U x , then the actual trajectory actually converges to the desired one. <p> The objective is to achieve fast trajectory tracking in pitching and rolling. As these two directions are coupled, we need to decouple the above equations to obtain independent control over pitch and roll. It an be calculated that the vector relative degree for the above system is given by <ref> [2; 2; 2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 1 sinusoids with a finite spectrum, then one can use nonlinear regulator theory (see [2],[3]). However, if the class of desired trajectories is more general, for example, functions which are n times continuously differentiable but otherwise arbitrary, then according to <ref> [4] </ref>, the feedback linearizing controller forms an inner loop of the overall tracking controller. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the effect of input saturation on feedback linearization and in designing controllers for stabilization and tracking.

Reference-contexts: We calculate the regions of attraction of the controllers based on feedback linearization and characterize the space of feasible trajectories. The problem of stabilization in the presence of input constraints goes at least as far back as <ref> [5] </ref>. It is important to note that saturating inputs affect the classical controllability and stabilizability notions. <p> In this case one is interested in knowing what states are stabilizable. Explicit characterizations as well as computational methods to obtain the controllable sets for linear systems under input constraints can be found in [7, 8].

Reference-contexts: For example, for the scalar system, _x = x + u juj M it is clear that regardless of the control law, any initial condition jx (0)j &gt; M can not be stabilized to the origin. This fact is documented in <ref> [6] </ref>, where it is shown that linear systems with poles in the right half plane can not be globally stabilized using bounded controls. Therefore for systems with poles in the right half plane, stabilization results must be local. In this case one is interested in knowing what states are stabilizable.
