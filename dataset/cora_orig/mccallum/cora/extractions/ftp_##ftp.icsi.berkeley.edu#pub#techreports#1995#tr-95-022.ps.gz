Abstract: Scalability is a critical metric when evaluating the design of any distributed system. In this paper we examine Suite 2 of the Tenet Network Protocols, which supports real-time guarantees for multi-party communication over packet switched networks. In particular, we evaluate the scalability of both the system design and the prototype implementation of the signaling protocol, RCAP2. The scalability of the design is analyzed on several levels. It is analyzed with regard to its support for large internetworks, many multi-party connections, and a large number of receivers in a single connection. In addition, the prototype implementation is examined to see where decisions have been made that reduce the scalability of the initial system design. We propose implementation alternatives that are more scalable. Finally, we evaluate the scalability of system design in comparison to those of the ST-II signaling protocol (SCMP) and of RSVP.

Reference-contexts: The second phase of connection setup is establishment. Although establishment follows the single round trip approach developed in Suite 1 of the Tenet Protocols, we now must scale those techniques to service a (potentially large) number of heterogeneous receivers <ref> [BetFerGupHe95] </ref>. The multicast establishment process will be presented here as proceeding from the source to the destinations and back. The reader, however, should keep in mind that this process can be implemented in the reverse direction with very few modifications.

Reference-contexts: This information is used to compute a route from the source to the set of receivers. Routing can be accomplished either by a server that has some knowledge about the current network state [Widyono94], or it can be dynamically calculated <ref> [BierNonn95] </ref>. There are some obvious scaling issues associated with a centralized version of the first approach. These scaling problems can be alleviated by distributing the routing server and by using a routing algorithm based on successive refinements [Moran95]. We discuss this scaling issue in more depth in Section 5.1.1.

Reference-contexts: A dynamic filter is used if the receiver wishes to switch channels, thereby dynamically choosing which source can use the resources. The dynamic filter option is currently labeled experimental in the RSVP specification <ref> [BrZhEsHeJa95] </ref>. Given the basic MxN paradigm, there is some complexity involved in negotiating resources on common sub-paths for receivers using different packet filters.

Reference-contexts: The owspec as listed in the ST-II specification consists of a large set of parameters. This set includes such common indices as throughput and delay, as well as several less clearly defined parameters such as DutyFactor and Reliability <ref> [DelHerHofSch94] </ref>. Several implementors of ST-II have chosen to allow the use of only some subset of these parameters. All establishment events are sender-oriented. During establishment, a route is dynamically generated from the source to the set of receivers, and resources are allocated 7 on the way.

Reference-contexts: The use of hierarchical encoding has been suggested in [ZhaDeer93], but this approach implies that the data encoding format is visible to the filtering at the network layer. In addition, does the filtering code in the network recognize all encoding formats, or is this information somehow user-supplied <ref> [DelHerVogWol93] </ref>? In Suite 2, we avoid these issues by suggesting that separate channels be set up for each encoded layer. This technique makes the support for multiple data rates invisible to the network. Our approach does require the receiver to reassemble the data arriving on different channels.

Reference-contexts: The second extension, create path backwards, progresses from the target toward the source. The initial owspec must be provided out-of-band or chosen by the target. This latter approach can lead to a mismatch between resource allocations. The authors of <ref> [DelHerHofSch93] </ref> suggest that a small set of encoding and data format helps to solve the problem. However, it is difficult to restrict the number of encoding and data formats if we wish to support a wide variety of applications, which again touches on the problem of scalability.

Dynamic attachment is attempted to all channels currently established to the target set. Attachment follows a process similar to the one outlined in the previous section. In the first phase, a route is found from the receiver to the nearest attachment point on the multicast tree.

Reference-contexts: Recall that non-real-time traffic may still use the unused resources of any partition, while real-time channels may only use resources in their specified partition. 3.1.4 Advance Reservation Advance reservation allows channels to be set up for a fixed interval in the future <ref> [FerGupVen95] </ref>. This special case of establishment allows distributed applications to more easily coordinate a large complex communication structure by reserving the resources for it in advance of their use. This is analogous to booking hotel rooms in advance for a conference.

Reference-contexts: Several design decisions have been made with this in mind. Like Suite1, Suite 2 supports multiple scheduling algorithms. The design of RCAP2 allows us to plug in several different admission control tests depending on the scheduling algorithm being supported by the node. It has been noted <ref> [Ferrari92] </ref> that, as long as the scheduling algorithms used along the path of a connection are chosen from the very large class of service disciplines that can support real-time communication, then end-to-end guarantees can be met. <p> It has been proposed that tunneling (i.e. encapsulation) be used to cross sub-networks that do not support our protocols. If the end-to-end delay and jitter on the tunneled section of the path can be bounded then we can still support guaranteed service, otherwise we cannot <ref> [Ferrari92] </ref>. Finally the Tenet Protocols assume that routes be pre-computed prior to establishment. This requirement has obvious scaling limitations if one assumes that it requires centralized route calculation. Fortunately, this is not required.

The Tenet Groups work has been directed toward the issue of providing real-time guaranteed service over packet switched networks <ref> [FerVer90] </ref>. The Tenet Suite 1 project culminated in the design and implementation of a set of network protocols to provide connection-oriented service based on a simplex unicast real-time channel. In the Suite 2 project, we have extended this work to provide support for multi-party applications.

Reference-contexts: Through this technique, an application can specify usage patterns over a group of related channels, and the network can exploit this knowledge by optimizing resource allocation <ref> [GuHoMoNg95] </ref>. Related channels may share resources, and thus exploit statistical muliplexing gains. Although rate control is performed over the group of related channels, the network still guarantees that the requested performance bounds will be met over the individual channels.

Reference-contexts: This attachment process follows the description above, with the source specifying a owspec that may be modified as it progresses towards the target. The target may then accept or reject the connection. ST-IIs sender-oriented approach has been the center of much criticism <ref> [MiEsShZh94] </ref>, [DelHer-HofSch93]. By having all establishment attempts funneled through one point, the source becomes a bottleneck and a scaling limitation. The Heidelberg Transport Systems (HeiTS) implementation has addressed this problem by adding support for receiver-initiated attachment and providing it in two extensions.

Reference-contexts: There is no centralized or global decision making. Our connection-oriented approach, however, makes the Tenet Protocols vulnerable to node failure. Members of the Tenet group have addressed this concern in their work on fault handling <ref> [ParBan94] </ref>. Their approach to this problem uses rapid rerouting for fault recovery. Although their work was done in the context of Suite 1, there is no reason that these mechanisms cannot be extended to the multicast environment addressed by Suite 2.

Reference-contexts: By not fixing our approach to a single scheduling algorithm such as Weighted Fair Queueing <ref> [ParGal93] </ref>, which requires homogeneity among the nodes, we can support heterogeneous nodes and create real-time channels traversing many heterogeneous networks. RCAP2 chooses a scalable approach to admission control. Connection establishment decisions are distributed along the paths of the multicast tree.

Reference-contexts: For example, traditional CSMA/CD exponential backoff used in broadcast Ethernets results in non-deterministic behavior. Schemes modifying CSMA/CD by requiring reservation of transmission slots prior to transmission have been shown to support real-time guarantees over such types of LANs <ref> [YavPaiFin94] </ref>. Tenets connection-oriented approach requires that RTIP be present in all routers and switches on the path from source to destination (s). It has been proposed that tunneling (i.e. encapsulation) be used to cross sub-networks that do not support our protocols.

Reference-contexts: Unlike both ST-II and the Tenet Suite 2 Protocols, RSVP uses a MxN connection as its basic paradigm. This approach is supported by IP Multicast, which allows for several sources to send to a single multicast address. 28 RSVP uses a receiver-oriented reservation process <ref> [ZhaDeer93] </ref>. Receivers supply a owspec that contains both the requested data rate and the performance requirements for that receiver. Resources are negotiated for the receiver on the basis of this owspec. <p> RSVPs proposed receiver-oriented design leaves some open questions. For example, it is unclear how the data are to be formatted at the source in order to supply the varying rates specified by the collection of heterogeneous receivers. The use of hierarchical encoding has been suggested in <ref> [ZhaDeer93] </ref>, but this approach implies that the data encoding format is visible to the filtering at the network layer.

Reference-contexts: The second mechanism that supports higher network utilization is dynamic traffic management. Through DTM, the sources traffic can be accurately bounded over smaller intervals, thus allowing the peak and average rates to be closer to one another <ref> [ZhaKni95a] </ref>. As the peak and average rates merge, VBR traffic more closely resembles CBR traffic, and therefore, the utilization induced by a real-time channel increases. Finally, the protocols support not only deterministic but also statistical services.

Reference-contexts: When present, however, real-time traffic has priority over non-real-time traffic. Our protocols offer mathematically provable guarantees. These guarantees, however, do not restrict our approach to simply providing deterministic peak-rate allocation; as shown in <ref> [Zhang93] </ref>, we can provide deterministic guarantees while the sum of the peak rates of all accepted connections exceeds the speed of the link. The Tenet Protocol Suites also support a statistical service, which can co-exist with the more stringent deterministic service.
