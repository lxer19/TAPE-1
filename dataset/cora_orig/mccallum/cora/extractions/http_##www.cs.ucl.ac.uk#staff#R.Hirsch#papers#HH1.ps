Title: Step by Step Building Representations in Algebraic Logic important open problem from algebraic logic is
Author: Robin Hirsch Ian Hodkinson

Abstract: We consider the problem of finding and classifying representations in algebraic logic. This is approached by letting two players build a representation using a game. Homogeneous and universal representations are characterised according to the outcome of certain games. The Lyndon conditions defining representable relation algebras (for the finite case) and a similar schema for cylindric algebras are derived. Countable relation algebras with homogeneous representations are characterised by first order formulas. Equivalence games are defined, and are used to establish whether an algebra is !-categorical. We have a simple proof that the perfect extension of a representable relation algebra is completely representable.

Reference-contexts: A representation is called permutational if it is one-transitive. We can call the relation algebra n-transitive (permutational) if it has some n-transitive (respectively permutational) representation. In [McK70] it is shown that the subalgebras of group relation algebras are not finitely axiomatisable over the permutational relation algebras. Andreka et. al. <ref> [ADN92] </ref> go on to show that the permutational relation algebras are not finitely axiomatisable over the integral relation algebras. They do this by constructing an infinite set of integral non-permutational relation algebras but show that they have a permutational ultraproduct.

Reference-contexts: It is not hard to show <ref> [Hir94] </ref> that the atomic networks of the Allen interval algebra form an amalgamation class. The last part of theorem 5 now tells us that it has a countable, universal, homogeneous, square representation, and that any two such representations are base-isomorphic to each other. <p> If there are infinitely many clusters of size 7 and 11, but no other clusters, then the representation is neither universal nor homogeneous. Thus B has many non-base-isomorphic, countable, square representations. 12 See <ref> [Hir94] </ref> for a generalisation of Ladkin and Maddux's result to all interval algebras. <p> Question: can an integral relation algebra whose networks form an amalgamation class be extended to a group relation algebra? Does the converse hold? It is fairly easy to use these results to show that some of the best known relation algebras are !-categorical; see <ref> [Hir94] </ref> for more details. The point algebra and the Allen interval algebra can both be shown to be !-categorical (first proved in [VK86] and [vBC90]).

Maddux went on in <ref> [Mad82] </ref> to show that every weakly associative relation algebra can be represented as a subalgebra of a proper relation algebra relativized to a symmetric, reflexive relation. (See section 11 below.) A considerable generalisation of this work on relativized relation algebra, also based on the step by step method, can be found <p> We see that an important assumption has been made, namely that an atomic network is consistent. This assumption turns out to be valid only on a certain subclass of the class of all relation algebras | those where N et (A) forms a TAP-class (defined later). 6 In <ref> [Mad82] </ref> an atomic network is called an A-labelling of ff where ff is the size of the matrix or equivalently the number of nodes in the graph. 7 Network N is a tightening of network M if N and M have exactly the same nodes, and for all nodes i and <p> It is square by definition. Since any complete representation is a complete homomorphism, the converse follows from (1, a ) b). 2 8 In <ref> [Mad82] </ref> a network satisfying this property is called a complete A-labelling. 9 More directly, suppose for contradiction that there is an a 2 A with a 6= 0 but N fl (a) = 0. <p> to show that the other labels must be N 0 (a)(n 0 ; n 0 ) = Id ^ a; a ^ ; N 0 (a)(n 1 ; n 1 ) = Id ^ a ^ ; a; N 0 (a)(n 1 ; n 0 ) = a ^ (see <ref> [Mad82] </ref> lemma 5.12 (1)).

Reference-contexts: Later, we will approach this problem using games, which will give us a quite considerable simplification in the definition of the conditions as well as the proof of completeness. 3 McKenzie <ref> [McK70] </ref> page 286, provides the simplest example of a relation algebra, with just four atoms, which does not possess a representation. Monk [Mon64] proves that the class RRA cannot be finitely axiomatised at all. <p> A representation is n-transitive for all n &lt; ! if and only if it is homogeneous. A representation is called permutational if it is one-transitive. We can call the relation algebra n-transitive (permutational) if it has some n-transitive (respectively permutational) representation. In <ref> [McK70] </ref> it is shown that the subalgebras of group relation algebras are not finitely axiomatisable over the permutational relation algebras. Andreka et. al. [ADN92] go on to show that the permutational relation algebras are not finitely axiomatisable over the integral relation algebras. <p> PROBLEM 9 Can an infinite, atomic relation algebra be categorical in any uncountable cardinal (under the obvious definition)?

Reference-contexts: However, more careful examination of the proof shows that by moving to a two-dimensional framework the model is built step by step and only universal-existential conditions need be satisfied. Restrictions on space prevent us from giving more details here. The same step by step method is used in <ref> [Rey92] </ref> to extend this result to predicate temporal logic by showing the completeness of some axioms over the class of all linear flows with constant domains (in predicate temporal logic each moment in time is associated with a domain and there is quantification over that domain).
