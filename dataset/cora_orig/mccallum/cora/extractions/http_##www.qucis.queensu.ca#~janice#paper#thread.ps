Abstract: This paper presents a computational methodology for integrating techniques from protein image interpretation and protein sequence threading, applied to the problem of structure determination from experimental X-ray crystallographic electron density maps. In the proposed architecture, image interpretation of an electron density map produces candidate structural segments; threading is applied to evaluate these hypothesized segments and thus to constrain the set of possible image interpretations. We present the results of experiments designed to test the ability of the threading module to discriminate between correct and incorrect alignments of protein sequences onto structural fl The authors wish to thank Tony Chiverton, Peter Sibbald, Carroll Johnson, Laurence Leherte, Temple Smith, Jim White, Bob Rogers, Raman Nambudripad and Ljubomir Buturovic for their useful discussions and for their assistance in the development of the theory and practice of our algorithms.

Reference-contexts: The ability to evaluate the connectivity of the models was also tested. We assessed this discrimination capability by first deriving attribute profiles for a given training set of protein structures retrieved from the Protein Databank of Brookhaven (PDB) <ref> (Bernstein et al. 1977) </ref>. These profiles were then used in the objective function for the threading algorithm, which was tested on various proteins.

Reference-contexts: In particular, critical points corresponding to local maxima (peaks) and saddle points with (-,-,+) eigen--values (passes) are computed. The use of the critical point mapping as a method for analyzing protein electron density maps was first proposed by Johnson <ref> (Johnson 1977) </ref> for the analysis of medium to high resolution protein electron density maps. More recently, the topological approach has been extended and enhanced for the analysis of low to medium resolution maps of proteins (Leherte et al. 1994a; 1994b). <p> More recently, the topological approach has been extended and enhanced for the analysis of low to medium resolution maps of proteins (Leherte et al. 1994a; 1994b). The topological approach to the segmentation of proteins has been implemented in the computer program ORCRIT <ref> (Johnson 1977) </ref>. By first locating and then connecting the critical points, this program generates a representation that captures the skeleton and some volumetric features of a protein image. <p> Calculating density statistics A database of 27 non-homologous and structurally-diverse proteins was used, providing a total of 4594 residues.

ORCRIT <ref> (Johnson 1977) </ref> was run on each reconstructed map, producing a set of critical points for each protein. The score for a particular threading of sequence onto a model represents the compatibility of the particular amino acids in the sequence with a set of corresponding local residue environments in the model.

Reference-contexts: The main computational work of a threading procedure is therefore the constrained search for a sequence-structure alignment that optimizes the objective function. Our threading module incorporates a modified version of a gapped alignment threading algorithm developed by Lathrop and Smith <ref> (Lathrop & Smith 1996) </ref>. This algorithm is able to find the global minimum three-dimensional threading between a protein sequence and a core motif; the search method was designed to work with various scoring functions and threading methodologies. <p> They must be balanced to minimize the effect of residue frequency in the database. If c 2 is too low, common residues are "pushed" into the aligned sections, and rare residues are "pushed" into the gaps (non-aligned sections). We consider optimal threadings <ref> (Lathrop & Smith 1996) </ref>, which minimize the objective function, and native threadings, which define the mapping of the correct subsequence to the correct segment. We measure the success of a threading experiment in terms of several criteria: * The number of correctly aligned structural segments and critical points.

Reference-contexts: All plausible connections are given; these graphs should subsume the linear graph corresponding to the backbone. Applying ORCRIT to electron density maps generated at medium resolution provides for a detailed analysis of the protein structures <ref> (Leherte et al. 1994b) </ref>. As illustrated in Figure 2 (a), the topological approach produces a skeleton of a protein backbone as a sequence of alternating peaks (dark circles) and passes (light circles).

Reference-contexts: Future research includes considering various approaches from machine learning to determine possible structural motifs to be used for image interpretation and threading. For example, we can apply Unger's algorithm <ref> (Unger et al. 1989) </ref> to find patterns of hex-amers that can be used to "tile" the main chain of a protein image derived from a molecular scene analysis. As well, machine learning and discovery techniques will be studied and applied in order to relate structural motifs to amino acid sequences.

Reference-contexts: Such an approach would allow us to combine partial matches from multiple models. This will be addressed by extending the probabilistic framework of White et al. <ref> (White, Much-nik, & Smith 1994) </ref>.
