Title: Real-Time Communication in Packet-Switched Networks  
Author: ~Caglan M. Aras, James F. Kurose, Douglas S. Reeves and Henning Schulzrinne 
Abstract: The dramatically increased bandwidths and processing capabilities of future high-speed networks make possible many distributed real-time applications, such as sensor-based applications and multimedia services. Since these applications will have traffic characteristics and performance requirements that differ dramatically from those of current data-oriented applications, new communication network architectures and protocols will be required. In this paper we discuss the performance requirements and traffic characteristics of various real-time applications, survey recent developments in the areas of network architecture and protocols for supporting real-time services, and develop frameworks in which these, and future, research efforts can be considered.

Reference-contexts: For strictly synchronous connections that are continuously active, a simple elastic store or queue is sufficient. If the clock used to sample the source is not strictly synchronized with that used to consume the data at the receiver, measures such as adjustable clocks <ref> [1] </ref> and digital phase-locked-loops [31], speech time scaling [41, 88] or frame dropping/replication [26] must be used. When multiple traffic sources are present in an application, as would be the case in a multimedia application, the playout of these connections must be synchronized.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, it is important that LANs also provide real-time communication services. Recent research on LAN real-time services has concentrated on the Token Ring and FDDI. A real-time service called the timed token protocol <ref> [2] </ref> can be implemented in these networks. Unfortunately, this protocol can only support a restrictive set of delay bounds. Strosnider [115] and Lim et al. [74] applied the earliest deadline first scheduling technique to extend real-time support for arbitrary delay bounds.

Reference-contexts: The protocol itself does not specify or support packet scheduling. The SRP resource reservation protocol <ref> [3] </ref>, on the other hand, is an example of a split protocol. It uses a remote-procedure-call mechanism to reserve resources, but does not carry user data.

Reference-contexts: terms "due-date" and "deadline" are time instants, while the synonymous terms "maximum allowable latency" and "end-to-end deadline" are time intervals. 6 schedulers Earliest Due Date or EDD (also called Earliest Deadline First (EDF)) [77] are preferred in cases where individual link delays must be less than the packet interarrival time <ref> [5, 40, 63, 121] </ref>. In the EDD method, the packet with the earliest due date has the highest scheduling priority. To guarantee that user-specified end-to-end deadlines can be met, the schedulability of individual links must be checked. <p> Shin [133] propose but do not investigate a method based on link deadlines, suitable for deadline-based scheduling algorithms. 8 Scheduler-based methods The scheduler-based methods for hard real-time communication are: EDD-D: earliest due-date for delay [40] EDD-J: earliest due-date for jitter [121] SRT: smallest response time [63] PCT: preemptive cut through <ref> [5] </ref> An application specifies the end-to-end deadline, D i , for the packets in connection i. From this deadline for path i , the link deadline d j i for each link ` j 2 i must be determined during the first phase of admission control. <p> Dividing this slack among the links of the path allows the deadline requirements of future connections to be more easily satisfied. Ferrari [40] suggested evenly dividing the end-to-end slack among all of the links on the path. Aras <ref> [5] </ref> suggested an adaptive admission algorithm which allocates slack to the more heavily congested links. Simulation results indicated that this algorithm permits higher utilization with tighter end-to-end deadlines than Ferrari's approach. <p> Using long packets reduces scheduling overhead, while using shorter packets reduces or eliminates the possibility of preemptions. In addition, end-to-end latencies are increased by using longer packets. The preemptive cut-through (PCT) data transfer protocol <ref> [5] </ref> is a variation of EDD-J that offers much lower end-to-end delay. In PCT, the transmission of a packet is pipelined over multiple links along its path. <p> timestamp in each packet, which is updated at each node along the path. 14 Table 3: Hard Real-Time Communication Service Disciplines Method Type D min D max J EDD-Delay [4, 40, 63] Scheduler H t H T D H t EDD-Jitter [121] Scheduler H t H T T t PCT <ref> [5] </ref> Scheduler t HT T t RCSP-Rate [129] Rate Ht HT D Ht Stop-and-Go [43] Rate HT 2HT 2T HRR [62] Rate Ht 2HT 2HT Ht WFQ [25],PGPS [94] Rate HT + Ht max D Ht 3.6 Summary We have presented a variety of methods for hard real-time communication. <p> Note: The publications listed in Table 4 are available through anonymous ftp from sites on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: Since for 22 some real-time services, low delays are more important than low buffer overflow losses, it may be appropriate to give space priority to data traffic and time priority to real-time traffic. Awater and Schoute <ref> [6] </ref> investigate the optimal combination of low-delay or low-loss policies through dynamic programming. When the buffer fills, the oldest low-delay packet is replaced.

Reference-contexts: It may be preferable to either distinguish packets of different importance [30, 97, 98] or truncate packets under congestion, removing less-significant information first [41, 45, 54, 64, 112, 113]. An overview of other priority policies suitable for reducing delay losses is given in <ref> [7, p. 181] </ref>. 4.3.2 Laxity-based policies The asynchronous time sharing system (ATS) [59] also offers a traffic class suitable for soft real-time sources. In the MARS scheduling algorithms, the so-called class-II traffic gets the slots in a round-robin cycle not needed by the class I (delay bounded) traffic.

Reference-contexts: Packets at lower priority levels than k are transmitted after the first n k b k slots of the frame for level k; HRR is thus non-work-conserving. End-to-end delay and jitter are both less than or equal to 2HF T k for a connection assigned to level k. Banerjea <ref> [8] </ref> analyzed the queueing delays in some detail. In weighted head-of-the-line processor sharing, each connection has a separate queue, and the first packet of each queue gets a weighted fair share of the bandwidth. <p> The construction of bandwidth-efficient and scalable dynamic multicast topologies is a challenging problem.

Reference-contexts: It has been recognized [126], however, that these models may not accurately capture voice patterns 16 and in particular, the silence periods . A three-state model with long and short silence periods has been suggested [16]. Models for voice monologues, such as lectures, <ref> [9, 50, 114,122] </ref> depend strongly on the sensitivity of the silence detector. Recent research [108] indicates that not only are silent periods poorly modeled by exponential distributions, but also the delays predicted by that model significantly underestimate actual network delays, even when several sources are multiplexed.

Reference-contexts: A partial list includes: multimedia conferencing [42], shared workspaces, remote medical diagnosis, telephony, command and control systems <ref> [10] </ref>, distributed interactive simulation, audio and video broadcasts, and games. Many of the traffic sources for which real-time service is desirable share characteristics that set them apart from traditional data traffic.

Reference-contexts: The extent to which these interactions must be considered and the extent to which a reliable guarantee can be provided without taking such considerations into account remains an important question for future research. It has been observed <ref> [11, 92] </ref> that an estimate of the worst-case performance can be obtained by assuming that a connection's traffic maintains its input characteristics as it progresses through the network.

Reference-contexts: Generally, sources have to be more closely controlled for tighter quality of service commitments and more highly-utilized networks. Traffic can be shaped by passing it through a device that delays packets to ensure, for example, that the advertised peak rate is not exceeded <ref> [12, 47, 129] </ref>. The source itself may be able to adjust its transmission rate to changing network or receiver conditions, although the rate is fixed for many current audio and video codecs. The network may also need to protect itself from malfunctioning or malicious traffic sources.

Reference-contexts: The statistics of these silence and talkspurt periods have been studied for conversational voice [48, 60, 82, 91]. A number of Markovian models for voice packet generation have been proposed for interactive conversations, both for a system with two parties [14, 15] and for a single party <ref> [13, 82] </ref>. The most common model for a single party is that of a two-state (silence and talkspurt) Markov chain [15,60,82]. In this model, a speaker talks, generating packets periodically, for an exponentially distributed amount of time, and then becomes silent for another exponentially distributed amount of time.

Reference-contexts: Thus larger buffers are needed at nodes farther and farther "downstream." The regulator holds incoming packets in a buffer until their proper release time. This buffer can be implemented by a calendar queue <ref> [17] </ref> and a single reference clock. For queues serving packets with small delay bound variance, the average insertion time of the calendar queue is O (1).

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that soft real-time applications do not, by their nature, require that a QOS guarantee be provided. Indeed a number of recent experiments <ref> [18] </ref> have demonstrated the possibility of supporting soft real-time applications over networks such as the Internet which provide no QOS guarantees. <p> Parts of the current Internet are examples of such a system. A limited amount of real-time voice and video has been transmitted over the Internet with some success to several continents <ref> [18, 105] </ref>. 4.2.4 Synchronization of Soft Real-Time Traffic The audio and video applications previously discussed form an important sub-class of real-time applications.

Reference-contexts: The output queue for scheduler-based methods is implemented as a priority queue. Priority queues are somewhat expensive, both in hardware cost and processing time; see <ref> [21] </ref> for a discussion of different ways to implement priority queues. For the rate-based methods output queues can be implemented as FIFOs, which are simpler and faster. A queue demultiplexor can be implemented with simple combinational logic.

Reference-contexts: Characterization of video sources is even more problematic than voice, for one because the traffic characteristics depend strongly on the video coding algorithm employed. Statistical source descriptions have been attempted for quite some time <ref> [22, 51, 53, 75, 89, 93, 109] </ref>. Most descriptions focus on the luminance portion, since it dominates the bandwidth requirements and is considered to be representative of the whole video signal.

Reference-contexts: Kubota et al. [68] propose a pure space priority scheme that discards loss-tolerant audio cells first, then data traffic, and finally, loss-sensitive video traffic. Several different scheduling algorithms for providing varying degrees of priority to real-time traffic were examined in <ref> [23] </ref>. The issue of scheduling two classes of soft real-time traffic with correlated deadlines was considered in [99]. A local queue control policy is proposed in [106, 107] that discards on arrival to a queue those packets that are going to wait longer than a set time. <p> Note: The publications listed in Table 4 are available through anonymous ftp from sites on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: Strosnider [115] and Lim et al. [74] applied the earliest deadline first scheduling technique to extend real-time support for arbitrary delay bounds. However, the maximum network utilization in FDDI is limited to 33 percent, and protocol overheads are very high. Buffer insertion rings like ORBIT <ref> [24] </ref> allow scheduling of packets on each station. Zheng [132] proposed a method based on EDF scheduling; this method results in lower overheads and allows full network utilization.

Reference-contexts: High-bandwidth CBR connections with stringent performance requirements use their own queue with individual time slice assignments, while other connections may be combined into a single assignment. Connections are admitted if a model based on on/off sources approximated by the first two moments predicts sufficient QOS. Clark et al. <ref> [25] </ref> propose a three-level hierarchy: guaranteed, predicted, and best-effort service. Guaranteed service with deterministic delay bounds is provided by weighted fair queueing. A connection requests a particular clock rate based on worst-case queueing delay it can accept. <p> However, the connection must belong to one of a predefined set of classes, and its traffic must, presumably, correspond to the traffic characteristics of that class if the guarantees are to be reliable. In the on-line approach described in <ref> [25, 61] </ref>, the bandwidth requirements of already-admitted token bucket-controlled connections are determined from the current, measured behavior of these connections rather than the traffic parameters declared by these connections when they first arrived to the network. <p> This measured behavior, together with the declared parameters of an arriving connection, are then used in making the connection acceptance/rejection decision for the incoming connection. Note that with the observation-based approach of <ref> [25, 61] </ref> no firm QOS guarantees can be made; this is because the QOS "guarantee" is based on traffic loads measured at connection admission time, and these loads may change once the connection is admitted. <p> It may be advantageous to apply the philosophy of the MARS scheduler and MLT to schedule best-effort traffic if all real-time traffic has per-node deadlines sufficiently far into the future. Another approach that avoids the difficulty of using explicit deadlines was proposed by Clark et al. <ref> [25] </ref>. Their FIFO+ scheduling policy tracks the average queueing delay experienced by all packets at a particular node through a low-pass filter. On departure, the amount of time that a packet's individual delay differed from the average delay is added to a delay variance accumulator in the packet header.

Reference-contexts: If the clock used to sample the source is not strictly synchronized with that used to consume the data at the receiver, measures such as adjustable clocks [1] and digital phase-locked-loops [31], speech time scaling [41, 88] or frame dropping/replication <ref> [26] </ref> must be used. When multiple traffic sources are present in an application, as would be the case in a multimedia application, the playout of these connections must be synchronized.

Reference-contexts: It uses a remote-procedure-call mechanism to reserve resources, but does not carry user data.

In this model, in any time interval t the maximum number of arriving packets may not exceed i + (t=T i ).

In [71], performance bounds on the per-connection distribution of delay are computed for a sample 27-connection 13-node network, and are shown to be tight for some traffic parameter values but quite loose for others.

Reference-contexts: For traffic that can tolerate losses of a few percent, the combined loss from selective discarding and excessive end-to-end delay can be cut in half for a five-node network. It may be preferable to either distinguish packets of different importance <ref> [30, 97, 98] </ref> or truncate packets under congestion, removing less-significant information first [41, 45, 54, 64, 112, 113].

In this section, we briefly describe three different approaches to provide such statistical guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Simulation results indicated that this algorithm permits higher utilization with tighter end-to-end deadlines than Ferrari's approach.

Reference-contexts: An example is packetized voice. In the case of voice sources, the variation results primarily from the "on-off" characteristics of human speech. While a speaker is talking, packets are periodically generated. During periods of no speech, such as pauses between words and sentences, the packet generation rate may change <ref> [35] </ref>. The decision of whether or not to generate packets during periods of silence, and indeed the definition of silence periods themselves, is application-dependent. The statistics of these silence and talkspurt periods have been studied for conversational voice [48, 60, 82, 91].

Reference-contexts: During stream admission, these properties assist the network in determining the resources to be allocated to a particular real-time session. This characterization must be unambiguous, easy to specify, enforceable, and usable for reserving resources <ref> [36] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we briefly describe three different approaches to provide such statistical guarantees. These are the source-based, bounding, and observation-based approaches. Additional information about some of these techniques may be found in [70]. Source-based approach In the source-based approach to providing QOS guarantees <ref> [37, 40, 46, 124] </ref>, traffic sources at the network's edge and within the network are characterized by relatively "simple" models.

Reference-contexts: terms "due-date" and "deadline" are time instants, while the synonymous terms "maximum allowable latency" and "end-to-end deadline" are time intervals. 6 schedulers Earliest Due Date or EDD (also called Earliest Deadline First (EDF)) [77] are preferred in cases where individual link delays must be less than the packet interarrival time <ref> [5, 40, 63, 121] </ref>. In the EDD method, the packet with the earliest due date has the highest scheduling priority. To guarantee that user-specified end-to-end deadlines can be met, the schedulability of individual links must be checked. <p> In table 1, the notation used to describe the various methods is defined. 11 Zheng and Shin [133] propose but do not investigate a method based on link deadlines, suitable for deadline-based scheduling algorithms. 8 Scheduler-based methods The scheduler-based methods for hard real-time communication are: EDD-D: earliest due-date for delay <ref> [40] </ref> EDD-J: earliest due-date for jitter [121] SRT: smallest response time [63] PCT: preemptive cut through [5] An application specifies the end-to-end deadline, D i , for the packets in connection i. <p> From this deadline for path i , the link deadline d j i for each link ` j 2 i must be determined during the first phase of admission control. Ferrari and Verma <ref> [40] </ref> were the first to propose a method for computing the minimum acceptable link deadline. For each link the feasibility of scheduling the existing connections plus this new connection i must be checked. <p> For the scheduler-based methods, this works as follows. Let the end-to-end slack be equal to the difference between the offered and required end-to-end deadlines. Dividing this slack among the links of the path allows the deadline requirements of future connections to be more easily satisfied. Ferrari <ref> [40] </ref> suggested evenly dividing the end-to-end slack among all of the links on the path. Aras [5] suggested an adaptive admission algorithm which allocates slack to the more heavily congested links. Simulation results indicated that this algorithm permits higher utilization with tighter end-to-end deadlines than Ferrari's approach. <p> The jitter control algorithms (EDD-J, SRT, RCSP, and PCT) require a timestamp in each packet, which is updated at each node along the path. 14 Table 3: Hard Real-Time Communication Service Disciplines Method Type D min D max J EDD-Delay <ref> [4, 40, 63] </ref> Scheduler H t H T D H t EDD-Jitter [121] Scheduler H t H T T t PCT [5] Scheduler t HT T t RCSP-Rate [129] Rate Ht HT D Ht Stop-and-Go [43] Rate HT 2HT 2T HRR [62] Rate Ht 2HT 2HT Ht WFQ [25],PGPS [94] Rate <p> In this section, we briefly describe three different approaches to provide such statistical guarantees.

In [37,46], 19 the QOS measure of interest is packet loss; in <ref> [40] </ref> the measure of interest is maximum delay. One advantage of the source-based approach is its simplicity, which makes it well-suited for real-time, on-line implementation. <p> An example might be to have more congested nodes provide a poorer QOS guarantee, while less congested nodes provide a more stringent performance guarantee. Some early research addressing this issue are <ref> [40, 86] </ref>. Bounding approach The bounding approach explicitly considers the effects of multiplexing on a connection's traffic characteristics, and hence its performance, as the traffic passes through various multiplexers. We illustrate the statistical bounding approach by briefly considering the methodology described in [71].

Reference-contexts: For each arriving packet, one token is taken out of the bucket. When an arriving packet finds an empty bucket, it can be discarded or queued; in either case, it is not allowed to enter the network immediately upon its arrival. Golestani <ref> [43] </ref> characterizes a connection by its rate r i and its frame F , with interval T F . A traffic source is permitted to generate no more than r i T F bits during any interval of length T F . <p> Aras [5] suggested an adaptive admission algorithm which allocates slack to the more heavily congested links.

Implementation is more straightforward for the rate-based methods, although scheduler-based methods also appear to be practical. An important point to make about rate-based methods is the coupling between the service parameters. For instance, Golestani shows that for the Stop-and-Go method <ref> [43] </ref>, jitter, buffer space, and end-to-end delay are all linearly proportional to the frame size T F , and the increments of bandwidth allocation are inversely proportional to T F . A similar coupling exists in round-robin methods such as HRR.

Reference-contexts: Generally, sources have to be more closely controlled for tighter quality of service commitments and more highly-utilized networks. Traffic can be shaped by passing it through a device that delays packets to ensure, for example, that the advertised peak rate is not exceeded <ref> [12, 47, 129] </ref>. The source itself may be able to adjust its transmission rate to changing network or receiver conditions, although the rate is fixed for many current audio and video codecs. The network may also need to protect itself from malfunctioning or malicious traffic sources.

Reference-contexts: Our focus is on wide-area networks, although many of the ideas discussed are equally applicable to local area networks. Occassionally, special mention is made to ATM <ref> [49] </ref>, as it is the likely technology for carrying real-time packetized traffic. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we look at the characteristics of some of the applications that require real-time network services. <p> However, it appears that the ITU-TS is moving towards a network architecture that can provide strict quality of service guarantees for voice and video in ATM networks <ref> [49, p. 31] </ref>. 14 In section 4.2.2 we discuss recent research addressing the connection-acceptance and QOS issues. First, however, we consider the fact that an integrated network architecture must support not only soft real-time applications, but potentially hard real-time applications and best-effort applications as well.

Reference-contexts: It has been recognized [126], however, that these models may not accurately capture voice patterns 16 and in particular, the silence periods . A three-state model with long and short silence periods has been suggested [16]. Models for voice monologues, such as lectures, <ref> [9, 50, 114,122] </ref> depend strongly on the sensitivity of the silence detector. Recent research [108] indicates that not only are silent periods poorly modeled by exponential distributions, but also the delays predicted by that model significantly underestimate actual network delays, even when several sources are multiplexed.

For example, in current equipment for sharing leased lines, real-time voice packets receive service priority [87].

Reference-contexts: Priorities also simplify the decision of whether to accept a new connection. This is because the admission procedure for higher-priority traffic can ignore lower-priority traffic, provided enough aggregate bandwidth is left so that the QOS guaranteed to lower-priority traffic can be met. ATS <ref> [58] </ref> offers guarantees to classes of traffic, rather than individual connections. That is, all connections within a class get the same QOS. Class I traffic experiences bounded delay and is given priority over all other classes by being able to claim all available bandwidth within a scheduling cycle.

Reference-contexts: However, the connection must belong to one of a predefined set of classes, and its traffic must, presumably, correspond to the traffic characteristics of that class if the guarantees are to be reliable. In the on-line approach described in <ref> [25, 61] </ref>, the bandwidth requirements of already-admitted token bucket-controlled connections are determined from the current, measured behavior of these connections rather than the traffic parameters declared by these connections when they first arrived to the network. <p> This measured behavior, together with the declared parameters of an arriving connection, are then used in making the connection acceptance/rejection decision for the incoming connection. Note that with the observation-based approach of <ref> [25, 61] </ref> no firm QOS guarantees can be made; this is because the QOS "guarantee" is based on traffic loads measured at connection admission time, and these loads may change once the connection is admitted. <p> For this reason, connections receiving guarantees based on observation are referred to as receiving "predicted service." A potential advantage of offering predicted rather than guaranteed service is that the network may be more fully utilized. A quantitative discussion of this issue can be found in [70]. In <ref> [61] </ref>, a simulation study of a two-hop network with predictive service also indicates that the approach may indeed provide relatively reliable guarantees.

Reference-contexts: terms "due-date" and "deadline" are time instants, while the synonymous terms "maximum allowable latency" and "end-to-end deadline" are time intervals. 6 schedulers Earliest Due Date or EDD (also called Earliest Deadline First (EDF)) [77] are preferred in cases where individual link delays must be less than the packet interarrival time <ref> [5, 40, 63, 121] </ref>. In the EDD method, the packet with the earliest due date has the highest scheduling priority. To guarantee that user-specified end-to-end deadlines can be met, the schedulability of individual links must be checked. <p> is defined. 11 Zheng and Shin [133] propose but do not investigate a method based on link deadlines, suitable for deadline-based scheduling algorithms. 8 Scheduler-based methods The scheduler-based methods for hard real-time communication are: EDD-D: earliest due-date for delay [40] EDD-J: earliest due-date for jitter [121] SRT: smallest response time <ref> [63] </ref> PCT: preemptive cut through [5] An application specifies the end-to-end deadline, D i , for the packets in connection i. <p> For each link the feasibility of scheduling the existing connections plus this new connection i must be checked. Their method is only valid under the assumption that the sum of all packet transmission times is less than the shortest period of any connection using the link. Kandlur <ref> [63] </ref> removed this restriction with an algorithm that assigns static priorities to existing connections based on their link deadlines. The static priority assignment results in non-minimal deadline assignments in certain circumstances. <p> In PCT, the transmission of a packet is pipelined over multiple links along its path. PCT can achieve an end-to-end delay close to that of circuit-switching if link deadlines are set to their minimum possible values Kandlur <ref> [63] </ref> has proposed another method of splitting long packets in order to pipeline their transmission. 3.5.2 Rate-Based Methods The rate-based methods exhibit a greater variety of mechanisms than is the case for the scheduler-based methods; therefore, we discuss packet multiplexing for each method individually. <p> The jitter control algorithms (EDD-J, SRT, RCSP, and PCT) require a timestamp in each packet, which is updated at each node along the path. 14 Table 3: Hard Real-Time Communication Service Disciplines Method Type D min D max J EDD-Delay <ref> [4, 40, 63] </ref> Scheduler H t H T D H t EDD-Jitter [121] Scheduler H t H T T t PCT [5] Scheduler t HT T t RCSP-Rate [129] Rate Ht HT D Ht Stop-and-Go [43] Rate HT 2HT 2T HRR [62] Rate Ht 2HT 2HT Ht WFQ [25],PGPS [94] Rate

Reference-contexts: Tolerable losses for video are generally much lower, but depending on the coding algorithms used and the effort expended on reconstructing lost video cells at the receiver, packet losses of as much as one percent can be sustained <ref> [65] </ref>.

In this section, we discuss network architecture and protocol mechanisms designed specifically for handling such loss-tolerant soft real-time traffic.

Reference-contexts: In the case of soft real-time communication, the QOS requirement will be the delay and jitter bounds, and the application's maximum tolerable packet loss due to either buffer overflow or exceeding the delay bound <ref> [70] </ref>. To determine the QOS which can be offered to an application, the network must first characterize the application's traffic characteristics. The two dominant classes of soft real-time traffic which we discuss are audio and video. The traffic characteristics of soft real-time applications can vary over time. <p> In this section, we briefly describe three different approaches to provide such statistical guarantees. These are the source-based, bounding, and observation-based approaches. Additional information about some of these techniques may be found in <ref> [70] </ref>. Source-based approach In the source-based approach to providing QOS guarantees [37, 40, 46, 124], traffic sources at the network's edge and within the network are characterized by relatively "simple" models. An example of such a source model is the on/off voice source [46,85,124] described in section 4.1. <p> For this reason, connections receiving guarantees based on observation are referred to as receiving "predicted service." A potential advantage of offering predicted rather than guaranteed service is that the network may be more fully utilized. A quantitative discussion of this issue can be found in <ref> [70] </ref>. In [61], a simulation study of a two-hop network with predictive service also indicates that the approach may indeed provide relatively reliable guarantees. <p> Note: The publications listed in Table 4 are available through anonymous ftp from sites on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: Some early research addressing this issue are [40, 86]. Bounding approach The bounding approach explicitly considers the effects of multiplexing on a connection's traffic characteristics, and hence its performance, as the traffic passes through various multiplexers. We illustrate the statistical bounding approach by briefly considering the methodology described in <ref> [71] </ref>. In that work, no assumptions are made about the actual cell interarrival times, as is done in traditional queueing theory. <p> In the first step, all connection flows are characterized at each multiplexer; in the second step performance bounds are computed. The two-step procedure is similar in spirit to [28, 29], although quite different in what is actually computed during each step. In <ref> [71] </ref>, performance bounds on the per-connection distribution of delay are computed for a sample 27-connection 13-node network, and are shown to be tight for some traffic parameter values but quite loose for others. <p> An important outstanding research issue for the statistical bounding approach is the extent to which traffic can be characterized by, or policed to conform to, the form of the distributional bounds required by <ref> [19, 20, 71, 125] </ref>. Perhaps the most important outstanding research issue for the statistical bounding approach is its reliance on the ability to bound the maximum length of each queue's busy period for a given set of traffic specifications. <p> Note: The publications listed in Table 4 are available through anonymous ftp from sites on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: A traffic source is permitted to generate no more than r i T F bits during any interval of length T F .

Reference-contexts: Recent research on LAN real-time services has concentrated on the Token Ring and FDDI. A real-time service called the timed token protocol [2] can be implemented in these networks. Unfortunately, this protocol can only support a restrictive set of delay bounds. Strosnider [115] and Lim et al. <ref> [74] </ref> applied the earliest deadline first scheduling technique to extend real-time support for arbitrary delay bounds. However, the maximum network utilization in FDDI is limited to 33 percent, and protocol overheads are very high. Buffer insertion rings like ORBIT [24] allow scheduling of packets on each station.

Reference-contexts: Characterization of video sources is even more problematic than voice, for one because the traffic characteristics depend strongly on the video coding algorithm employed. Statistical source descriptions have been attempted for quite some time <ref> [22, 51, 53, 75, 89, 93, 109] </ref>. Most descriptions focus on the luminance portion, since it dominates the bandwidth requirements and is considered to be representative of the whole video signal.

The exponential decay of the autocorrelation function implied by autoregressive models may depend on the source material [55]; for example, the rhythmic head movements of singers are clearly reflected in a periodic autocorrelation function.

Reference-contexts: Beyond the source correlation, the queueing delay is also affected by rapid changes in bit rate during scene changes. Models combining several autoregressive processes try to capture this effect [100, 101, 127]. A somewhat more general random process known as TES has also been used <ref> [73, 81] </ref>. The influence of the codec and source material on a range of statistical measures, in particular entropy-related ones, is shown in [103].

Reference-contexts: Some real-time sources have inherent characteristics that distinguish them from typical data sources. For example, voice packets tend to be small to minimize packetization delays [83] and to limit the effect of packet losses <ref> [82] </ref>. The 48-byte cell size for ATM [116], for example, was chosen primarily for the benefit of voice applications in particular, to avoid the use of echo cancellation equipment on continental connections. Also, small packets limit the amount of time a single packet can occupy the channel. <p> Packet loss can result either from buffer overflow at the destination or within the network, or from late packet arrivals at the destination. For short audio segments, tolerable loss values as high as 50 percent have been cited <ref> [82] </ref>, while high-quality audio has been shown in subjective tests to tolerate loss rates of five percent for speech and ten percent for music [84]. <p> The decision of whether or not to generate packets during periods of silence, and indeed the definition of silence periods themselves, is application-dependent. The statistics of these silence and talkspurt periods have been studied for conversational voice <ref> [48, 60, 82, 91] </ref>. A number of Markovian models for voice packet generation have been proposed for interactive conversations, both for a system with two parties [14, 15] and for a single party [13, 82]. <p> The statistics of these silence and talkspurt periods have been studied for conversational voice [48, 60, 82, 91]. A number of Markovian models for voice packet generation have been proposed for interactive conversations, both for a system with two parties [14, 15] and for a single party <ref> [13, 82] </ref>. The most common model for a single party is that of a two-state (silence and talkspurt) Markov chain [15,60,82]. In this model, a speaker talks, generating packets periodically, for an exponentially distributed amount of time, and then becomes silent for another exponentially distributed amount of time.

Reference-contexts: A more fundamental concern is that the traffic models employed, whether at the source or deep within the network, require some form of Markovian assumptions. While traffic at the edge of the network may be reasonably well-approximated by such models <ref> [85] </ref>, it is still unknown whether this is also true for a connection's traffic when it is "deep" within the network, where the traffic characteristics have potentially been altered as a result of the traffic having passed through several multiplexers. <p> Note: The publications listed in Table 4 are available through anonymous ftp from sites on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: An example might be to have more congested nodes provide a poorer QOS guarantee, while less congested nodes provide a more stringent performance guarantee. Some early research addressing this issue are <ref> [40, 86] </ref>. Bounding approach The bounding approach explicitly considers the effects of multiplexing on a connection's traffic characteristics, and hence its performance, as the traffic passes through various multiplexers. We illustrate the statistical bounding approach by briefly considering the methodology described in [71]. <p> Note: The publications listed in Table 4 are available through anonymous ftp from sites on the Internet.

Reference-contexts: For example, in current equipment for sharing leased lines, real-time voice packets receive service priority <ref> [87] </ref>. Since for 22 some real-time services, low delays are more important than low buffer overflow losses, it may be appropriate to give space priority to data traffic and time priority to real-time traffic. Awater and Schoute [6] investigate the optimal combination of low-delay or low-loss policies through dynamic programming.

Reference-contexts: If the clock used to sample the source is not strictly synchronized with that used to consume the data at the receiver, measures such as adjustable clocks [1] and digital phase-locked-loops [31], speech time scaling <ref> [41, 88] </ref> or frame dropping/replication [26] must be used.

Reference-contexts: Characterization of video sources is even more problematic than voice, for one because the traffic characteristics depend strongly on the video coding algorithm employed. Statistical source descriptions have been attempted for quite some time <ref> [22, 51, 53, 75, 89, 93, 109] </ref>. Most descriptions focus on the luminance portion, since it dominates the bandwidth requirements and is considered to be representative of the whole video signal. <p> Two potential uses for model-based video source descriptions are for the generation of simulation sequences and for use in analytical performance models. For the former, autoregressive models of differing complexity have been widely used. First order models <ref> [79, 89, 120, 128] </ref> and second-order models [53] can capture the autocorrelation structure of video sources. The exponential decay of the autocorrelation function implied by autoregressive models may depend on the source material [55]; for example, the rhythmic head movements of singers are clearly reflected in a periodic autocorrelation function.

Reference-contexts: Simulation results indicated that this algorithm permits higher utilization with tighter end-to-end deadlines than Ferrari's approach.

Reference-contexts: that the statistics of the traffic entering the network depend on the nature of the source material, the encoding method used, and the timing of packets by the encoder (a large packet every video frame, smaller packets equally spaced over the frame duration, or smaller packets transmitted at peak rate <ref> [102] </ref>). Thus, models for differing timescales may be needed [56, 90]. The description of sources is made easier by the fact that in many real-time applications, the source of the data is a sensor which samples a physical quantity to produce a digital signal.

In this section, we briefly describe three different approaches to provide such statistical guarantees.

Reference-contexts: Several different scheduling algorithms for providing varying degrees of priority to real-time traffic were examined in [23].

A local queue control policy is proposed in <ref> [106, 107] </ref> that discards on arrival to a queue those packets that are going to wait longer than a set time. This policy is based on the observation that during temporary overload resources are wasted in carrying packets that would likely miss their end-to-end deadline. <p> Deadline-based policies such as these divide the end-to-end deadline into per-node deadlines. In many real networks, however, only a subset of nodes are congested and have trouble meeting packet deadlines. Thus, to increase node utilization and to reduce the delay variance, it has been suggested <ref> [106, 108] </ref> to use the laxity divided by the number of hops left to travel as the scheduling criterion. This metric also has the advantage that it readily gives the same delay performance to connections with large and small numbers of hops.

Reference-contexts: A three-state model with long and short silence periods has been suggested [16]. Models for voice monologues, such as lectures, [9, 50, 114,122] depend strongly on the sensitivity of the silence detector. Recent research <ref> [108] </ref> indicates that not only are silent periods poorly modeled by exponential distributions, but also the delays predicted by that model significantly underestimate actual network delays, even when several sources are multiplexed. <p> Deadline-based policies such as these divide the end-to-end deadline into per-node deadlines. In many real networks, however, only a subset of nodes are congested and have trouble meeting packet deadlines. Thus, to increase node utilization and to reduce the delay variance, it has been suggested <ref> [106, 108] </ref> to use the laxity divided by the number of hops left to travel as the scheduling criterion. This metric also has the advantage that it readily gives the same delay performance to connections with large and small numbers of hops.

Reference-contexts: Characterization of video sources is even more problematic than voice, for one because the traffic characteristics depend strongly on the video coding algorithm employed. Statistical source descriptions have been attempted for quite some time <ref> [22, 51, 53, 75, 89, 93, 109] </ref>. Most descriptions focus on the luminance portion, since it dominates the bandwidth requirements and is considered to be representative of the whole video signal.

Reference-contexts: Recent research on LAN real-time services has concentrated on the Token Ring and FDDI. A real-time service called the timed token protocol [2] can be implemented in these networks. Unfortunately, this protocol can only support a restrictive set of delay bounds. Strosnider <ref> [115] </ref> and Lim et al. [74] applied the earliest deadline first scheduling technique to extend real-time support for arbitrary delay bounds. However, the maximum network utilization in FDDI is limited to 33 percent, and protocol overheads are very high.

Reference-contexts: Some real-time sources have inherent characteristics that distinguish them from typical data sources. For example, voice packets tend to be small to minimize packetization delays [83] and to limit the effect of packet losses [82]. The 48-byte cell size for ATM <ref> [116] </ref>, for example, was chosen primarily for the benefit of voice applications in particular, to avoid the use of echo cancellation equipment on continental connections. Also, small packets limit the amount of time a single packet can occupy the channel.

Reference-contexts: Two potential uses for model-based video source descriptions are for the generation of simulation sequences and for use in analytical performance models. For the former, autoregressive models of differing complexity have been widely used. First order models <ref> [79, 89, 120, 128] </ref> and second-order models [53] can capture the autocorrelation structure of video sources. The exponential decay of the autocorrelation function implied by autoregressive models may depend on the source material [55]; for example, the rhythmic head movements of singers are clearly reflected in a periodic autocorrelation function.

Reference-contexts: terms "due-date" and "deadline" are time instants, while the synonymous terms "maximum allowable latency" and "end-to-end deadline" are time intervals. 6 schedulers Earliest Due Date or EDD (also called Earliest Deadline First (EDF)) [77] are preferred in cases where individual link delays must be less than the packet interarrival time <ref> [5, 40, 63, 121] </ref>. In the EDD method, the packet with the earliest due date has the highest scheduling priority. To guarantee that user-specified end-to-end deadlines can be met, the schedulability of individual links must be checked. <p> to describe the various methods is defined. 11 Zheng and Shin [133] propose but do not investigate a method based on link deadlines, suitable for deadline-based scheduling algorithms. 8 Scheduler-based methods The scheduler-based methods for hard real-time communication are: EDD-D: earliest due-date for delay [40] EDD-J: earliest due-date for jitter <ref> [121] </ref> SRT: smallest response time [63] PCT: preemptive cut through [5] An application specifies the end-to-end deadline, D i , for the packets in connection i. <p> control algorithms (EDD-J, SRT, RCSP, and PCT) require a timestamp in each packet, which is updated at each node along the path. 14 Table 3: Hard Real-Time Communication Service Disciplines Method Type D min D max J EDD-Delay [4, 40, 63] Scheduler H t H T D H t EDD-Jitter <ref> [121] </ref> Scheduler H t H T T t PCT [5] Scheduler t HT T t RCSP-Rate [129] Rate Ht HT D Ht Stop-and-Go [43] Rate HT 2HT 2T HRR [62] Rate Ht 2HT 2HT Ht WFQ [25],PGPS [94] Rate HT + Ht max D Ht 3.6 Summary We have presented a <p> D min and D max denote the minimum and maximum value of the delay bound that could be requested from the method.

Implementation is more straightforward for the rate-based methods, although scheduler-based methods also appear to be practical. An important point to make about rate-based methods is the coupling between the service parameters. <p> The construction of bandwidth-efficient and scalable dynamic multicast topologies is a challenging problem.

Reference-contexts: As long as packets within the network can be reordered or experience variable delays, isochronous applications require an end-to-end mechanism to reconstruct the source timing relationships between packets. Protocols for voice transport [27] and more general real-time transport protocols <ref> [32, 104, 123] </ref> address this need. 4.2.2 Providing Statistical Guarantees on Delay and Loss A number of researchers have advocated providing soft real-time applications with connection-level statistical guarantees on packet loss. In this section, we briefly describe three different approaches to provide such statistical guarantees.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we briefly describe three different approaches to provide such statistical guarantees. These are the source-based, bounding, and observation-based approaches. Additional information about some of these techniques may be found in [70]. Source-based approach In the source-based approach to providing QOS guarantees <ref> [37, 40, 46, 124] </ref>, traffic sources at the network's edge and within the network are characterized by relatively "simple" models. An example of such a source model is the on/off voice source [46,85,124] described in section 4.1.

Reference-contexts: An important outstanding research issue for the statistical bounding approach is the extent to which traffic can be characterized by, or policed to conform to, the form of the distributional bounds required by <ref> [19, 20, 71, 125] </ref>. Perhaps the most important outstanding research issue for the statistical bounding approach is its reliance on the ability to bound the maximum length of each queue's busy period for a given set of traffic specifications.

Reference-contexts: In this model, a speaker talks, generating packets periodically, for an exponentially distributed amount of time, and then becomes silent for another exponentially distributed amount of time. Successive talkspurt and silence periods lengths are assumed to be statistically independent. It has been recognized <ref> [126] </ref>, however, that these models may not accurately capture voice patterns 16 and in particular, the silence periods . A three-state model with long and short silence periods has been suggested [16].

Reference-contexts: For example, it was found that either a gamma [53,109] or a normal distribution [79] describes the bit generation process. A normal distribution may also be an appropriate model for the aggregate bit rate of ten or more sources <ref> [127] </ref>. Two potential uses for model-based video source descriptions are for the generation of simulation sequences and for use in analytical performance models. For the former, autoregressive models of differing complexity have been widely used. <p> Beyond the source correlation, the queueing delay is also affected by rapid changes in bit rate during scene changes. Models combining several autoregressive processes try to capture this effect <ref> [100, 101, 127] </ref>. A somewhat more general random process known as TES has also been used [73, 81]. The influence of the codec and source material on a range of statistical measures, in particular entropy-related ones, is shown in [103].

Traffic can be shaped by passing it through a device that delays packets to ensure, for example, that the advertised peak rate is not exceeded <ref> [12, 47, 129] </ref>. The source itself may be able to adjust its transmission rate to changing network or receiver conditions, although the rate is fixed for many current audio and video codecs.
