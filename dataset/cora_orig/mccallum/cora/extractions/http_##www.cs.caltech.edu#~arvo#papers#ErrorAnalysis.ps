Abstract: In this paper we identify sources of error in global illumination algorithms and derive bounds for each distinct category. Errors arise from three sources: inaccuracies in the boundary data, discretiza-tion, and computation. Boundary data consist of surface geometry, reflectance functions, and emission functions, all of which may be perturbed by errors in measurement or simulation, or by simplifications made for computational efficiency. Discretization error is introduced by replacing the continuous radiative transfer equation with a finite-dimensional linear system, usually by means of boundary elements and a corresponding projection method. Finally, computational errors perturb the finite-dimensional linear system through imprecise form factors, inner products, visibility, etc., as well as by halting iterative solvers after a finite number of steps. Using the error taxonomy introduced in the paper we examine existing global illumination algorithms and suggest new avenues of research.

Reference-contexts: Sillion et al. [35] used a truncated series of spherical harmonics to capture directional dependence and a quadrilateral mesh of surface elements for the spatial dependence. As a third contrasting approach, Aup-perle et al. <ref> [3] </ref> used piecewise-constant functions defined over pairs of patches to account for both directional and spatial variations. The accuracy of the approximation is limited by the space of basis functions; in general, the exact solution cannot be formed by a finite linear combination of polynomials or other basis functions.

Reference-contexts: We now look at examples of each of these. 4.3.1 Perturbation of the Linear System The most computationally expensive operation of global illumination is the evaluation of the matrix elements in equation (17); this is true even of algorithms that do not store an explicit matrix <ref> [7] </ref>. Furthermore, only in very special cases can the matrix elements be formed exactly, as they entail visibility calculations coupled with multiple integration. Consequently, the computed matrix is nearly always perturbed by computational errors. A common example of an error in this category is imprecise form factors. <p> This has been done in a number of ways, including Gaussian elimination [10], Gauss-Seidel [8], Southwell relaxation (shooting) <ref> [7, 11] </ref>, and Jacobi iteration [13].

Other approaches, such as progressive radiosity <ref> [7] </ref>, construct matrix elements on the fly and then discard them. The cost of computing these elements generally precludes complete convergence, making this source of error significant. 5 Quantifying Error Thus far the discussion has focused on the sources of error without attempting to quantify them.

Reference-contexts: In the case of constant basis functions over planar boundary elements, the resulting matrix has a unit diagonal with point-to-area form factors off the diagonal, which is a widely used radiosity formulation <ref> [8] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For instance, this holds whenever there is exactly one collocation point within the support of each basis function, or when orthogonal polynomials are used in a Galerkin based approach.

Reference-contexts: For global illumination the space X n may consist of n boundary elements over which the radiance function is con stant. Alternatively, it may consist of fewer boundary elements, but with internal degrees of freedom, such as tensor product polynomials [41], spherical harmonics [35], or wavelets <ref> [12] </ref>. In any case, each element of the function space X n is a linear combination of a finite number of basis functions, u 1 , . . . , u n . <p> Often a smoothing step is applied to piecewise-constant approximations for display purposes, although this does not necessarily improve the accuracy of the approximation. When non-constant elements are employed, such as tensor product polynomials [41, 37] or wavelets <ref> [12] </ref>, the degrees of freedom of the elements add to the dimension of the approximating subspace.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we attempt to establish a framework for error analysis within a well-defined class of global illumination problems. Specifically, we address the problem of approximating solutions to a form of the rendering equation <ref> [18] </ref> given imprecise data for geometry, reflectance functions, and emission functions. We further assume that the approximation is to be assessed quantitatively by its distance from the theoretical solution. By employing radiometric quantities and physically-motivated measures of error we temporarily sidestep the difficult issues of display and perception. <p> See Figure 1. Equation (1) is expressed in radiometric variables but otherwise embodies the same physical principles as the rendering equation introduced by Kajiya <ref> [18] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The operation is local in that the transformation occurs at each surface point in isolation. In equation (5) we have adopted the notation of Lebesgue integration <ref> [32] </ref> to introduce a measure that incorporates the cosine weighting. <p> The subject of normed linear spaces is extremely rich, and we shall only touch upon it here. For a more complete discussion see the classic texts by Rudin <ref> [32] </ref> or Kantorovich [19]. 5.1 Function Norms Infinitely many norms can be defined on the space of radiance functions, each conveying a different notion of size, distance, and convergence.

Reference-contexts: Such an approach may be useful for analyzing schemes in which geometry is simplified to improve the efficiency of global ilumination <ref> [33] </ref>. However, relating changes in geometry to bounds on the perturbation of G is an open problem. 6.2 Discretization Error In this section we study discretization errors introduced by projection methods.

Reference-contexts: Errors are also introduced when form factors are approximated through ray tracing [38] or by using simpler geometries [13]. These errors can be mitigated to some extent by the use of analytic form factors <ref> [5, 34] </ref>, yet there remain many cases for which no analytic expression is known, particularly in the presence of occluders. For non-constant basis functions the form factor computations are replaced by more general inner products, which require different approximations.

Reference-contexts: For global illumination the space X n may consist of n boundary elements over which the radiance function is con stant. Alternatively, it may consist of fewer boundary elements, but with internal degrees of freedom, such as tensor product polynomials [41], spherical harmonics <ref> [35] </ref>, or wavelets [12]. In any case, each element of the function space X n is a linear combination of a finite number of basis functions, u 1 , . . . , u n . <p> For non-diffuse environments the finite-dimensional space must also account for the directional dependence of surface radiance functions; several avenues have been explored for doing this. Immel et al. [17] used subdivided cubes centered at a finite number of surface points to simultaneously discretize directions and positions. Sillion et al. <ref> [35] </ref> used a truncated series of spherical harmonics to capture directional dependence and a quadrilateral mesh of surface elements for the spatial dependence. As a third contrasting approach, Aup-perle et al. [3] used piecewise-constant functions defined over pairs of patches to account for both directional and spatial variations. <p> For instance, the matrix elements in the Galerkin approach of Zatz [41] required four-fold integrals, which were approximated using Gaussian quadrature. Non-diffuse environments pose a similar difficulty in that the matrix elements entail integration with reflectance functions <ref> [35] </ref>. Another form of matrix perturbation arises from simplifications made for the sake of efficiency.

Reference-contexts: As a rule, we settle for solving near by problems for several reasons. First, the data used as input may only be approximate. For instance, reflectance and emission functions obtained through simulation [40] or empirically through measurement of actual materials or light sources <ref> [36, 39] </ref> are inherently contaminated by error. A second reason that boundary data may be perturbed is that use of the exact data may be prohibitively expensive or even impossible.

Reference-contexts: Often a smoothing step is applied to piecewise-constant approximations for display purposes, although this does not necessarily improve the accuracy of the approximation. When non-constant elements are employed, such as tensor product polynomials <ref> [41, 37] </ref> or wavelets [12], the degrees of freedom of the elements add to the dimension of the approximating subspace.

For diffuse environments with constant elements, the second inner product in equation (21) reduces to an area-to-area form factor. There are other possibilities for the linear functionals 1 , . . . , n .
