Abstract: With the vast number of information resources available today, a critical problem is how to locate, retrieve and process information. It would be impractical to build a single unified system that combines all of these information resources. A more promising approach is to build specialized information retrieval agents that provide access to a subset of the information resources and can send requests to other information retrieval agents when appropriate. In this paper we present the architecture of the individual information retrieval agents and describe how this architecture supports a network of cooperating information agents. We describe how these information agents represent their knowledge, communicate with other agents, dynamically construct information retrieval plans, and learn about other agents to improve efficiency. We have already built a small network of agents that have these capabilities and provide access to information for transportation planning.

Reference-contexts: This makes it possible to scale the architecture to large numbers of information sources. To build a network of specialized information agents, we need an architecture for a single agent that can be instantiated to provide multiple agents. In previous work we developed an information server, called SIMS <ref> [ Arens et al., 1993 ] </ref> , which provides access to heterogeneous data and knowledge bases. In addition, Pastor et al. [ 1992 ] developed a system called the Loom Interface Manager (LIM), which we use to build agents for accessing individual relational databases.

Reference-contexts: Each of these operations manipulates one or more sets of data, where the data is specified in the same terms that are used for communicating with SIMS. This simplifies the input/output since there is no conversion between languages. The planner is implemented in a version of UCPOP <ref> [ Barrett et al., 1993 ] </ref> that has been modified to generate parallel execution plans [ Knoblock, 1994 ] . The system searches through the space of possible plans using a best-first search until a complete plan is found.

Reference-contexts: Related Work A great deal of work has been done on building agents for various kinds of tasks. This work is quite diverse and has focused on a variety of issues. First, there has been work on multi-agent planning and distributed problem solving, which is described in <ref> [ Bond and Gasser, 1988 ] </ref> . The body of this work deals with the issues of coordination, synchronization, and control of multiple autonomous agents.

Reference-contexts: Both the domain and information source models are expressed in the Loom knowledge representation language [ Mac-Gregor, 1990 ] . Loom is an AI knowledge representation system based on KL-ONE <ref> [ Brachman and Schmolze, 1985 ] </ref> . Loom provides a language for representing hierarchies of classes and relations, as well as efficient mechanisms for classifying instances of classes and reasoning about descriptions of object classes.

Reference-contexts: However, this approach is unlikely to scale to the large number of evolving information sources (e.g., the Internet) since building an integrated schema is labor intensive and difficult to maintain, modify, and extend. The Carnot project <ref> [ Collet et al., 1991 ] </ref> also integrates heterogeneous databases using a knowledge representation system. Carnot uses a knowledge base to build a set of articulation axioms that describe how to map between SQL queries and domain concepts.

Reference-contexts: Communication between information agents is done using the Knowledge Query Manipulation Language (KQML) <ref> [ Finin et al., 1992 ] </ref> . KQML is an agent communication language that handles the interface protocols for transmitting queries, returning the appropriate information, and building the appropriate internal structures.

Reference-contexts: The reformulation from one query to another is done through logical inference using information-source abstractions, the abstracted knowledge of the contents of relevant information sources. See <ref> [ Hsu and Knoblock, 1993a ] </ref> for an explanation of how rules like these are automatically learned. The information-source abstractions describe the information in terms of a set of closed formulas of first-order logic. <p> This means that when it is not processing queries, it gathers information to aid in future retrieval requests. The information agents improve performance by learning about the contents of the information sources <ref> [ Hsu and Knoblock, 1993a ] </ref> . The learning is triggered when an agent detects an excessively expensive query. In this way, the agent will incrementally gather a set of rules to reformulate expensive queries.

Reference-contexts: The system will then select a subset of constraints in the inferred set to complete the reformulation. The selection is based on two criteria: reducing the total evaluation cost, and retaining the semantic equivalence. Detailed description of the algorithm is in <ref> [ Hsu and Knoblock, 1993b ] </ref> .

The approach taken in these systems is to first define a global schema, which integrates the information available in the different information sources.

A promising approach to this problem is to provide access to the large number of information sources by organizing them into a network of information agents <ref> [ Papazoglou et al., 1992 ] </ref> . The goal of each agent is to provide information and expertise on a specific topic by drawing on relevant information from other information agents.

Reference-contexts: KQML is an agent communication language that handles the interface protocols for transmitting queries, returning the appropriate information, and building the appropriate internal structures. We currently use this language to send queries between a SIMS agent and the LIM agents, which provide access to relational databases <ref> [ Pastor et al., 1992 ] </ref> . Processing an Information Request The core contribution of an information agent is the ability to intelligently retrieve and process data. Information sources are constantly changing; new information becomes available, old information may be eliminated or temporarily unavailable, and so on.

Third, there is more closely related work on developing agents for information gathering.
