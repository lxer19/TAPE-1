Abstract: Designing a web site is a complex problem. Logs of user accesses to a site provide an opportunity to observe users interacting with that site and make improvements to the site's structure and presentation. We propose adaptive sites: web sites that improve themselves by learning from user access patterns. Adaptive webs can make popular pages more accessible, highlight interesting links, connect related pages, and cluster similar documents together. An adaptive web can perform these self-improvements autonomously or advise a site's webmaster, summarizing access information and making suggestions. In this paper we define adaptive web sites, explain and formalize several kinds of improvements that an adaptive site can make, and give examples of applying these improvements to existing sites.
