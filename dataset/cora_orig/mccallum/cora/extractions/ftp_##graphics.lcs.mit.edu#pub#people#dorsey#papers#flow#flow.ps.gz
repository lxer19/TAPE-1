Abstract: An important, largely unexplored area of computer image generation is the simulation of weathering and its effects on appearance. Weathering results from the interaction of the environment with the materials in the world. The flow of water is one of the most pervasive and important natural forces involved in the weathering of materials, producing a distinctive set of patterns of washes and stains. This paper presents an intuitive phenomenological model for the flow of water over surfaces that is capable of generating such changes in appearance. We model the flow as a particle system, each particle representing a drop of water. The motion of the water particles is controlled by parameters such as gravity, friction, wind, roughness, and constraints that force the particles to maintain contact with the surface. The chemical interaction of the water with the surface materials is governed by a set of coupled differential equations describing both the rate of absorption of water by the surface and the rate of solubility and sedimentation of deposits on the surface. To illustrate the power of this simple model, we show examples of flows over complex geometries made from different materials; the resulting patterns are striking and very difficult to achieve using traditional texturing techniques.

Reference-contexts: Exactly how water travels over surfaces is very complicated and is dependent on a large number of variables. Unfortunately, the workings of complex flows are still not fully understood based on first principles <ref> [1] </ref>. However, for the purposes of this study, we are concerned with the patterns created by the flow of water on surfaces, not the detailed appearance of the flow itself. <p> of specific representative effects that are associated with this process. 2.1 Exposure and Runoff The basic factors affecting the rate of flow over a surface are the quantities of incident water, the height, inclination and geometry of the surface, and the absorption of water by the material comprising the surface <ref> [1, 4] </ref>. One of the major features of the pattern of flows on a building is the arrangement of water sources. From these sources, water flows downward under the influence of gravity. This is often termed primary flow.

Reference-contexts: Runoff occurs when the surface is fully saturated (i.e. has no more capacity to absorb water) or non-absorbent (i.e. has a low absorptivity). Figure 2 shows the relationship between incident rain, runoff, and absorption for several materials <ref> [2] </ref>. Curve A represents a spongy material with high absorptivity and absorption. This material has the capacity to absorb all the incident water over time, hence there is no runoff. Curve B describes a moderately absorbent concrete with high absorptivity but a limited absorption capacity. <p> A snapshot of particles flowing over a complex surface is shown in Figure 4. 3.2 Absorption Model The absorption of water by a surface depends largely on the properties of void space, or pores, in the material. However, for practical purposes the following model is often adopted <ref> [2] </ref>: Three parameters control the absorption: absorption, absorptivity, and saturation. Absorption is the maximum amount of water that the surface may hold, whereas absorptivity is the rate that the surface absorbs water. Saturation is the ratio of the actual water absorbed to the capacity of the surface.

Reference-contexts: A common example, known as the spilt-milk effect, can be readily observed in places where runoff from concrete leads to white streaking on brickwork below. Other examples include green stains generated by runoff from copper <ref> [3] </ref> or rust stains from other corroded metals such as iron. If there are several materials present, even more complex patterns of stains may occur depending on the relative solubilities of the different materials. Figures 1c and 1d depict examples of differential flow. <p> There is also staining due to partial flows on the sign below the lamp, in this case simulating a rust stain where the lamp meets the building. Similar staining and accumulation of a patina <ref> [3] </ref> are shown on the copper rain pipe on the left side of the building. Finally, on the sides of the upper window there is a pattern due to the differential flow of the copper patina.

Reference-contexts: In the production of Pixar's recent computer-generated film Toy Story, for example, weathering effects such as scuffs and dirt were added to the surfaces by painting textures and compositing them within a programmable shader <ref> [6] </ref>. However, this process is very time consuming. Current tools for texturing geometric models made from many surfaces are primitive; for example, it is very difficult to match textures across surface boundaries or account properly for area distortions caused by the parameterization.

Reference-contexts: The gutters and drainage system on the cathedral were carefully designed to be similar to those on actual cathedrals: water flows down the upper roof to a gutter below the railing which directs the water down the main columns, and down along the top of the flying buttresses <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This basic mechanism is illustrated in Figure 3. An interesting effect occurs at the locus of points on the surface where the runoff stops; this interface is critical with respect to staining, since this is where any dirt picked up by the runoff water is redeposited <ref> [10] </ref>. A very similar stain occurs when water evaporates, leaving behind any soluble material. Another interesting effect occurs when a non-absorbent surface is adjacent to a porous surface. In this case, the staining is limited to the porous material.
