Title: On Goal-Directed Provability in Classical Logic

Abstract: One of the key features of logic programming is the notion of goal-directed prov-ability. In intuitionistic logic, the notion of uniform proof has been used as a proof-theoretic characterization of this property. Whilst the connections between intuition-istic logic and computation are well known, there is no reason per se why a similar notion cannot be given in classical logic. In this paper we show that there are two notions of goal-directed proof in classical logic, both of which are suitably weaker than that for intuitionistic logic. We show the completeness of this class of proofs for certain fragments, which thus form logic programming languages. As there more possible variations on the notion of goal-directed provability in classical logic, there is a greater diversity of classical logic programming languages than intuitionistic ones. In particular, we show how logic programs may contain disjunctions in this setting. This provides a proof-theoretic basis for disjunctive logic programs, as well as charac-terising the "disjunctive" nature of answer substitutions for such programs in terms of the provability properties of the classical connectives 9 and _.

However, given a complete set of reduction properties, it is possible to use the unprovability of the reduced sequents as evidence of the unprovability of the original ones.

Now in order to study goal-directed provability in classical logic, it is necessary to determine a similar notion of goal-directedness for classical proofs. As classical sequents may contain an arbitrary number of formulae in a succedent, there seem to be two possible approaches.

We will refer to this proof system as LK. We write sequents as ! , where both and may contain an arbitrary number of formulae. In a sequent ! , is known as the antecedent, and as the succedent. A sequent ! is initial if " 6= ;.

In <ref> [10] </ref> the notion of a simple proof is introduced, which, essentially, makes -L work as a unary rule.

Reference-contexts: Hence, for either conception of goal-directed provability, there seems to be no inherent reason why programs cannot contain clauses of the form p _ q. Thus we will show how disjunctive logic programs <ref> [12] </ref> may be given a proof-theoretic basis. We show how both notions of goal-directed provability may be used to determine classes of formulae for which these notions are complete. <p> As noted above, the "disjunctive" nature of the reduction property for existential quantifiers is necessary. A similar notion may be found in the disjunctive logic programs of <ref> [12] </ref>, in that in such a system, a clause may have the form A 1 _ : : : _ A n B 1 ^ : : : ^ B m where n 1, m 0.

Reference-contexts: We discuss some possibilities of the application of these results in this direction, similar to those of <ref> [14] </ref>. This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we briefly review the classical sequent calculus and discuss some technical preliminaries. <p> Such a proof system would means that all the connectives had similar reduction properties. A further observation that may be made is that the completeness of the reduction properties may be used to derive sound rules for an "unprovability" calculus in the manner of <ref> [14] </ref>.
