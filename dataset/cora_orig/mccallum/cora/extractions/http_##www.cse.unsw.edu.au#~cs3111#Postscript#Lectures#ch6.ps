Reference-contexts: To overcome this problem, process descriptions are used to provide more details about the inner workings of all the processes depicted in the DFD. Typically, each process has its own process description (or minispecs as Tom De-marco <ref> [Demarco-78] </ref> calls it), which is akin to a policy statement that defines the function or purpose of the process.
