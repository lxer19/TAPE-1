Abstract: In this note, we consider the problem of interpolating a sparse function from the values of its multiple derivatives at some given point. We give efficient algorithms for reconstructing sparse Fourier series and sparse polynomials over Sturm-Liouville bases. In both cases, the number of evaluations is linear in the sparsity.

Reference-contexts: PROOF. The algorithm suggested in Theorem 3 is invoked twice. Step 1 and 2 can be performed in O (t 2 ) field operations using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm <ref> [2] </ref> for Toeplitz matrices. By using Zippel's algorithm [16] for the inversion of Vandermonde matrices, Step 4 also takes O (t 2 ) steps.

Reference-contexts: For the case of the power basis our algorithm coincides with the algorithm given by Lakshman and Saunders, however, we show that their intermediate restriction on the minimal degree of the occurring monomials is not necessary. The notion of a Sturm-Liouville basis was introduced by Bochner in <ref> [3] </ref>. Let K denote the field of complex or real numbers and let P = fP n g n2N 0 be a sequence of univariate polynomials over K in which the degree of P n is exactly n for n 2 N 0 .

In this section, we consider the corresponding interpolation problem for finite univariate Fourier series over the real numbers. In this case, the corresponding R-modules F n are not cyclic, nor does a generic point a 2 R exit.

Hence, for any point a 2 K and f 2 K [x], supp (f) = supp (f; a) [ supp (f 0 ; a) with respect to a classical orthogonal basis.
