Abstract: In the Proceedings of the Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelli- gence (UAI-94), Seattle, WA, 46-54, July 29-31, 1994. Technical Report R-213-B April, 1994 Abstract Evaluation of counterfactual queries (e.g., "If A were true, would C have been true?") is important to fault diagnosis, planning, and determination of liability. In this paper we present methods for computing the probabilities of such queries using the formulation proposed in [Balke and Pearl, 1994], where the antecedent of the query is interpreted as an external action that forces the proposition A to be true. When a prior probability is available on the causal mechanisms governing the domain, counterfactual probabilities can be evaluated precisely. However, when causal knowledge is specified as conditional probabilities on the observables, only bounds can computed. This paper develops techniques for evaluating these bounds, and demonstrates their use in two applications: (1) the determination of treatment efficacy from studies in which subjects may choose their own treatment, and (2) the determination of liability in product-safety litigation.

Reference-contexts: We will refer to this domain-minimal variable as a response-function variable. r b is closely related to the potential response variables in Rubin's model of counterfactuals [Rubin, 1974], which was introduced to facilitate causal inference in statis tical analysis <ref> [Balke and Pearl, 1993] </ref>. <p> This is accomplished by tracking the conditions that lead to the various decisions in the Simplex Tableau algorithm. This procedure generates a decision tree where each leaf node contains a symbolic solution <ref> [Balke and Pearl, 1993] </ref>. 4 APPLICATION TO CLINICAL TRIALS WITH IMPERFECT COMPLIANCE Consider an experimental study where random assignment has taken place but compliance is not perfect (i.e., the treatment received differs from that assigned). <p> In addition, one can prove that these are the tightest possible assumption-free bounds. Examples and additional results regarding bounds on treatment effects in partial compliance studies are presented in <ref> [Balke and Pearl, 1993] </ref>. 5 APPLICATIONS TO LIABILITY JUDGMENT Evaluation of counterfactual probabilities could be enlightening in some legal cases in which a plaintiff claims that a defendant's actions were responsible for the plaintiff's misfortune. Improper rulings can easily be issued without an adequate treatment of counterfactu-als.

In this section we briefly describe the form of the functional model using response-function variables and how the solution is evaluated uniquely. <p> The connection between the factual and counterfactual worlds is discussed in <ref> [Balke and Pearl, 1994] </ref> where it is argued that the response-function variables should assume the same values in both worlds.

Reference-contexts: This leads naturally to the use of probabilistic causal networks, since these networks combine causal and probabilistic knowledge and permit reasoning from causes to effects as well as, conversely, from effects to causes. To emphasize the causal character of counterfactuals, we adopt the interpretation in <ref> [Pearl, 1993b] </ref>, according to which a counterfactual sentence "If it were A, then B would have been" states that B would prevail if A were forced to be true by some unspecified action that is exogenous to the other relationships considered in the analysis.

Reference-contexts: Every Bayes network can be represented by several functional specifications, each yielding different evaluations of a counterfactual. The problem is that, deciding what factual information deserves undoing (by the antecedent of the query) requires a model of temporal persistence, and, as noted in <ref> [Pearl, 1993c] </ref>, such a model is not part of static Bayesian networks. Functional specifications, however, implicitly contain the needed temporal persistence information.

Reference-contexts: Given the entire set of linear constraints and the objective function from Eq. (2), the bounds may be evaluated using techniques for optimizing non-linear objective functions under linear constraints <ref> [Scales, 1985] </ref>. In general, the optimization procedure may converge to a local minima/maxima which would produce false bounds. If the objective is to prove that the counter-factual probability falls within a certain range, care must be taken to ensure that global optima are found.
