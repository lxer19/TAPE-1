Abstract: With the growing demands from disciplinary and interdisciplinary fields of science and engineering for the numerical solution of the nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem, competitive new techniques have been developed for solving the problem. In this paper, we examine the start-of-the-art of the algorithmic techniques and the software scene for the problem. Some current developments are also outlined.

Reference-contexts: possible divergence of the iteration and identification problem, which means that we need to know if two iterations converge to the same root, is it multiple or have we missed a root? Theoretical aspects of such divide and conquer method have been discussed in recent papers by Adams and Arbenz <ref> [1] </ref>, Jessup [28]. A new divide and conquer method to find the Schur decomposition by using tools such as matrix sign function or beta function is under investigation by several groups [31, 3, 5].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Over several years working on the LAPACK project <ref> [2] </ref>, and on algorithm and software development of the nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem and communication with a variety of users who work in diverse fields involving scientific computing, the author have seen a growing demand for the numerical solution of the nonsymmetric eigenvalue problems. <p> Section 5 describes algorithms and software scene for the sparse nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem. 2 Section 6 discusses some contributions in the last decade which have become more widely appreciated. Sections 7 and 8 describe some work in progress and conclusions. 2 The nonsymmetric eigenproblem in LAPACK The LAPACK <ref> [2] </ref> is a transportable public domain library of Fortran 77 subroutines for solving the most common matrix computation problems, such as solving linear systems, least squares problems, eigenproblems and so on. The library was mainly supported by NSF beginning in 1987.

Reference-contexts: The interesting eigenvalues are the ones with small negative real parts, or the dominant ones. In [22], an eigenproblem problem solver is required to the numerical detection of Hopf bifurcation of parameter dependent nonlinear system modeling a tubular reactor. Chatelin et al <ref> [10] </ref> shows an eigenproblem from aeronautical industries. The interesting eigenvalues are those whose imaginary part lies in a frequence range chosen by the engineer. The matrix is sparse with a block structure and has order 10 3 to 10 4 . <p> It uses several shifts at a time to build a rational Krylov subspace. The work is at its early stage. A recent report by Chatelin and Godet-Thobie <ref> [10] </ref> is focused on the influence of the departure from normality of the matrix on the stability of the Arnoldi algorithm. <p> We terminate this section with an interesting practical higher order -matrix eigenvalue problems of the form ( 5 A 0 + 4 A 1 + 3 A 2 + 2 A 3 + A 4 + A 5 )x = 0: The problem is from structural mechanics combined with aerodynamics <ref> [10] </ref>. Beside to cast such eigenvalue problem to the standard eigenvalues problem, no much progress has been seen how to solve such -matrix eigenvalue problem directly and efficiently. 8 Conclusions The nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem is an inherently much harder problem than the symmetric eigenvalue problem.

There are two entries based on the nonsymmetric Lanczos method: 10 1. NSLEVAL by Cullum and Willoughby <ref> [12] </ref> is a Lanczos procedure with no reorthogo--nalization and no handling of possible breakdown. The procedure produces a complex symmetric tridiagonal matrix, whose eigenvalue problem is solved by a modified QL algorithm. 2. <p> The "good" eigenvalue repeat in these calculation for different m, whereas the "spurious" eigenvalues do not repeat <ref> [12] </ref>. 5.4 Simultaneous iteration versus Arnoldi versus Lanczos So far, we have not seen a published comprehensive comparative study of the three methods. We have seen that many factors from implementation and application problems could affect such a comparison. <p> This is the best we can expect. Such backward error analysis has served as the stopping criterion of the iteration methods. The numerical practices of this bound are reported by Cullum and Willoughby in 1986 <ref> [12] </ref>. 7 Work in progress The nonsymmetric eigenproblem, whether small or large, dense or sparse, is one of the hardest linear algebra problems to solve effectively and accurately. For the dense eigenvalue problem, the recent years research are mostly concentrated on the parallel algorithm development.

The so-called algorithm independency: It means that an algorithm refers the matrix in question only through an external user supplied subroutines to form the matrix-vector multiplications Av and/or A T v (or f (A)v and/or f (A T )v, where f (x) is a spectral transformation function).

Reference-contexts: of the iteration and identification problem, which means that we need to know if two iterations converge to the same root, is it multiple or have we missed a root? Theoretical aspects of such divide and conquer method have been discussed in recent papers by Adams and Arbenz [1], Jessup <ref> [28] </ref>. A new divide and conquer method to find the Schur decomposition by using tools such as matrix sign function or beta function is under investigation by several groups [31, 3, 5]. There is no identification problem for the methods and is built on the highly block matrix operations.

Reference-contexts: For nonsymmetric matrices, the norms of the residuals of approximate eigenpairs does not provide sufficient information to bound the error in the approximate eigenvalue. Parlett-Kahan-Jiang's theorem <ref> [29] </ref> developed in 1982 first gives a bound on the distance to the nearest matrix for which the given approximations are exact. This is the best we can expect. Such backward error analysis has served as the stopping criterion of the iteration methods.

Reference-contexts: Recently, [8, 9] have reported the stability analysis of 3-dimensional patterned states in the normal field instability of ferrofluids. The size of the related eigenvalue problem, when all possible patterns are "allowed" (by the boundary conditions) to compete, is of the order of 100,000!

The matrices involved in such problems are very large (up to 24; 000 fi 24; 000), real, banded sparse and unsymmetric. The interesting eigenvalues are the ones with small negative real parts, or the dominant ones.

Reference-contexts: Meanwhile, in numerical analysis community, since Parlett's exploratory review paper entitled "The Software Scene in the Extraction of Eigenvalues from Sparse Matrices" <ref> [34] </ref> nearly one decade ago, and with the successful development of the symmetric eigenvalue problem, many new numerical methods and analysis have been developed for the nonsymmetric eigenproblem. <p> A new book by Saad [44] is an elegant source for studying the start-of-the-art in large eigenproblem techniques. This review will only focus on the nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem in the aspects of its origins, algorithmic techniques, software scene and work in progress. As defined by Parlett <ref> [34] </ref> one decade ago, there are two different user groups for the eigenproblem. <p> A matrix is considered to be sparse if only a small percentage of its entries are nonzero. However, concerning the tradeoff between the sparsity and algorithm complexity and performance, we do not necessarily exploit the zeros. Following Parlett's suggestion in his 1984 paper <ref> [34] </ref>, "it is vital to science that one not be more precise than is necessary for the purpose in hand", we will leave user to decide whether his or her problem is small or large, dense or sparse. <p> However, for the large problem, it is still a research subject, and is the frontier of our expertise. Therefore, before we consider an algorithm for the problem, it does help to know where the problem comes from and what the users really want. In <ref> [34] </ref>, Parlett discusses eigenproblems from structural engineering, quantum chemistry, and plasma physics. Most of them are the symmetric eigenproblems. <p> Without doubt, the three methods will still continue compete each other in the coming years. With the growing number of applications and improvement of software environment, the picture will be more clear. 6 What have we learned since 1982 Since the publication of Parlett's essay <ref> [34] </ref> (which was from a talk given at a Sparse matrix Symposium held in Fairfield Glade, Tennessee in 1982), over the past decades, we have still been seeking a better way for an old task.

In <ref> [35] </ref>, an interesting eigenproblem of a transfer matrix from the Ising model, used in chemistry and biology, is discussed. The matrix is nonsymmetric, very sparse (only have two entries at each column and row) and huge (at order of 2 n ).

Reference-contexts: The author apologizes for the ignorance of some important contributions to the problem that are not mentioned here. A new book by Saad <ref> [44] </ref> is an elegant source for studying the start-of-the-art in large eigenproblem techniques. This review will only focus on the nonsymmetric eigenvalue problem in the aspects of its origins, algorithmic techniques, software scene and work in progress. <p> There is an extensive literature on these methods, too many to list in this essay. The reader is referred to <ref> [24, 44] </ref>. Simultaneous iteration method, whose prototype is Bauer's Treppeniteration, are the extension of the power method. It is still one of the most popular methods used for computing the dominant eigenvalues of large matrices, in particular, in the structure engineering. <p> Such advantage of the Lanczos and Arnoldi methods has been illustrated in many numerical experiments. However, a firm convergence theory has been established for simultaneous iteration [49], but there are still many qusetions for the Arnoldi and Lanc-zos algorithms <ref> [44] </ref>. The loss of (bi)-orthogonality among the computed basis (bases) of the Krylov subspaces in Arnoldi and Lanczos and its effects are not well-understood in contrast with the symmetric eigenproblem. Arnoldi method could also suffer from the unbounded growth in the core-storage. <p> Acceleration techniques: The idea of the acceleration techniques is to update the initial vector (s) in the restarted simultaneous iteration and Krylov subspaces methods, and to force the convergence of the residual vector (s) to zero faster. These techniques have been used in simultaneous iteration and Arnoldi method <ref> [44, 47] </ref>. 5. Deflation technique: As a common phenomenon in all algorithms, some of the eigen-values (and eigenvectors or Schur vectors) converge faster than the others. Therefore deflation procedures for those convergent eigenvalues (and eigenvectors or Schur vectors) can be quite effective in terms of execution time in practice.

Reference-contexts: The work is at its early stage. A recent report by Chatelin and Godet-Thobie [10] is focused on the influence of the departure from normality of the matrix on the stability of the Arnoldi algorithm. The research being undertaken by Bai [4], Days [14] and Strakos <ref> [52] </ref> is aiming at the error analysis of the Krylov subspaces method in the presence of the floating point arithmetic and the effect of the loss of the (bi-)orthogonality in the practical computation.

Reference-contexts: Van Dooren [53] proposed a prototype of block QR algorithm, but it is unclear the applicability of this idea. The convergence analysis of the general QR algorithm is carried out in <ref> [54] </ref>. The great success of the divide and conquer idea for the symmetric tridiagonal eigenprob-lem has led several researchers to extend it to the nonsymmetric Hessenberg eigenproblem.
