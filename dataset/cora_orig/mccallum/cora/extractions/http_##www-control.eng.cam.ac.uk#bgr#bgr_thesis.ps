Reference-contexts: Realistic problems will likely be a hybrid. Additionally, the B 1 ,D 1 terms have been added to allow the analysis of certain problems of interest (the Parallel Projection Operator (Section 8.3), and the PI anti-windup scheme in <ref> [1] </ref>). 3.3.7 Plant Output Saturation Configuration i - - - G (s) u w z The plant output saturation configuration is that which arises when the saturation element follows the plant (as shown in Figure 3.7). <p> Ax (t) + B 1 w (t) + B 2 (Kx (t)); z (t) = Cx (t); with A 2 R nfin , B 1 ; B 2 2 R nfi1 , K 2 R 1fin , C 2 R pfin , and with () each lying in the sector <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, i.e.,for all x 2 R, We use dissipation functions of the form: V (~) = ~ 0 P ~ + 2 0 (a form of function proposed by Lur'e and Postnikov). <p> There then exists an F 2 R mfin and an * &gt; 0 such that the operator mapping (u; v) to x generated by: x (0) = 0; is L p+ stable for all p 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. Proof: See [33]. 2 Additionally, for p = 1; 2, [33] gives comparison results which bound the induced norm in terms of the closed loop linear system. <p> However, if the sum of the "worst case" disturbance and the control input lies outside the linear region, the best choice is to take the appropriate end point of the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. One can easily derive this from noting that the optimisation with respect to ! is a quadratic function. Additionally, one can then see that if jK~j 1, A (~) 0 =) ~ B (~) 0. <p> The first step is to realise that we can express the function 0 as 0 (x) = 2 with (x) given by: (x) := 1 sign (x) 1 2 x jxj &gt; 1: The importance of this is that 1 2 x is the centre of the sector <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, and has the minimal norm to cover the sector. Now examine Figure 8.2. For ease of notation, let the linear operator with transfer function 1 s+a be denoted as G, and let H = G I+ 1 2 G . <p> In that paper, they prove the following Proposition. 99 Proposition 8.4.1: Consider the system operator generated by: _x 1 (t) = x 2 ; x (0) = 0; with a; b &gt; 0. Then the mapping w 7! x is not L p+ stable for all p 2 <ref> [1; 1] </ref>. Proof: This requires a fairly detailed analysis of test signals, and is done in [33, Section 8]. 2 As pointed out in [33], the system in the proposition is globally state space stable. <p> function generated by the heuristic is given by: V (~) = ~ 2 j~j 1; 6 j~j &gt; 1: The function ~ 2 is the solution to the corresponding (discrete) algebraic Riccati equation, and so for test values of the Hamiltonian which correspond to differences between two points lying in <ref> [1; 1] </ref>, the test holds with a test value of 1. 100 If we examine some ~ such that j~j 1, but jf (~; !)j &gt; 1, we first note that for all values of ! in the test interval, f (~; !) = !. <p> If we write ! = ~ + , we have that: H (~; !) = ~ + (~ + + 1)(2~ + + 1) 6 2 (~ + ) 2 + ~ 2 ; 1 The maximising choice of over the interval <ref> [1; 1] </ref> is = 1, and then we see that H (~; !) = 2j~j 1: If one verifies the algebra without setting fl = p 2, one will see that the choice of fl = p the minimal one such that the leading coefficient in the H (~; !) expression

Reference-contexts: Analytic solutions to the inequalities generally do not exist, but numerical schemes to find feasible solutions (if any exist) have been developed, and are the subject of current research. A useful recent reference which is an introduction to the theory is that by Boyd, El Ghaoui, Feron and Balakrishnan <ref> [4] </ref>. The authors in [4] stress that as long as analytic solutions are not demanded, reduction of an analysis problem to a linear matrix inequality is sufficient in some sense to have "solved" the problem. <p> A useful recent reference which is an introduction to the theory is that by Boyd, El Ghaoui, Feron and Balakrishnan <ref> [4] </ref>. The authors in [4] stress that as long as analytic solutions are not demanded, reduction of an analysis problem to a linear matrix inequality is sufficient in some sense to have "solved" the problem. <p> However, in Appendix B, a somewhat unusual construction is made which gives an interesting systems insight into the interpretation of the non-existence of the solution to a coupled pair of inequalities. We will now give some preliminary definitions taken from <ref> [4] </ref>. A linear matrix inequality is of the form: F (x) = F 0 + i=1 with F i 2 R nfin , and x 2 R m the variable. Once again, the inequality in (2.10) is interpreted as requiring that F (x) be positive definite. <p> The simplest in principle is the ellipsoid algorithm, which has some use in proofs. Since the late 1980's, interior point methods have been developed which are much more efficient. Their development has motivated the interest in this field. The reader is once again referred to <ref> [4] </ref>, and references therein. 12 Chapter 3 Fundamentals of the Theory of Linear Systems With Saturation 3.1 Introduction In this chapter, we will examine the basic systems properties of the class of systems to be studied in this dissertation, being linear systems with saturation. <p> We will now state a fairly generic result used to bound reachable sets, which is based on the use of a linear matrix inequality. This was taken from <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> t 2 R + , where = f~: ~ T P ~ 1g if there exists a symmetric, positive definite matrix P and positive scalar ff, which solve the linear matrix inequality problem: " B T P ffI 0; (3.11) Proof: The proof for this statement may be found in <ref> [4, Section 6.1.3] </ref>. 2. Remark 3.5.15: Characterising the inequality (3.11) as an LMI is not purely correct, as the product of ffP appears. Rather, one must determine for which (preferably small) ff a solution exists. <p> As our focus is on the operator gain computation 46 problem, and we are more interested in the plant input saturation configuration, we will only cite an example of recent linear matrix inequality based methods. The following results are quoted from the text <ref> [4] </ref>; an interested reader can consult further references therein for more detail. <p> Theorem 4.8.1: The function V defined in (4.7) is a valid Lyapunov function over R n if the linear matrix inequality in the variables P &gt; 0, 0, t 0, " B 0 2 K 0 2t &lt; 0 has a solution. Proof: This is taken from <ref> [4, Section 8.1.1] </ref>. 2 Remark 4.8.2: The variable t is a scaling factor. <p> Proof: This is taken from <ref> [4, Section 8.1.4] </ref>. 2 47 Chapter 5 Induced Norm Computation for Continuous Time Systems 5.1 Introduction In this chapter, we will examine the induced norm computation problem for the plant input saturation configuration in continuous time. The corresponding problem in discrete time will be considered in Chapter 6.

Reference-contexts: B. Lee. The necessity conditions for the continuous time case are ussually credited as first appearing in the text by E.B. Lee and L. Markus ([29]), although it was only proved in its full generality in the single input case. The papers of Brammer <ref> [5] </ref>, and Schmitendorf and Barmish [42] removed the assumptions, and the paper by Sontag [44] gave an algebraic approach for both continuous time and discrete time systems. <p> An important component of these works is the extension to more general constraint sets; such a level of generality is not of concern to the problems studied in this dissertation, however. In the paper by Brammer <ref> [5] </ref>, which extends the preliminary results of Saperstone and Yorke [41], reachability is characterised by using the convexity of the reachable set. 24 Theorem 3.5.11: A continuous time system generated by the equation (3.9) with zero initial conditions is globally reachable if and only if [A; B] is controllable and A <p> Proof: See <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 Remark 3.5.12: The result can be seen to follow from Theorem 3.5.8 if we examine the negative time version of the system - i.e., replace A; B with A; B. <p> This result also indicates that the only linear systems with saturation which are globally completely controllable are those with eigenvalues lying solely on the imaginary axis. Additionally, the paper <ref> [5] </ref> extends to general constraint sets the readily apparent fact that if the local linearisation is locally controllable, the system is locally completely controllable. <p> We take as our candidate dissipation function (with r = p V (~) = ~ 2 if j~j 4 r 3r 2 j~j &gt; 4 The functions A ; B (defined in Theorem 5.4.1) are plotted versus j~j over the interval <ref> [0; 5] </ref> in Figure 8.6, where it is seen that they are bounded above by 0 . Verification of the analytic form of the functions is omitted due to the tedious nature of the algebra necessary to do so.

Reference-contexts: The criterion is usually credited to Kalman, and can be found in most basic texts discussing the state space theory of linear systems; for example, see <ref> [8] </ref>, [45]. It is an interesting and useful fact that the criterion for controllability is the same for both the continuous and discrete time case. <p> Theorem 3.5.5: A (finite dimensional, shift invariant) linear system whose state dynamic equation is x = Ax + Bu, is globally completely controllable if and only if rank n o Proof: See <ref> [8] </ref>, [45]. 2 23 Remark 3.5.6: We can bend our terminology slightly, and say that if the rank condition in equation (3.8) holds, the matrices A; B form a controllable pair, or that [A; B] is controllable. 3.5.2 Open Loop Controllability We will now survey the controllability results for linear systems <p> Proof: This is a standard result of linear theory; for a proof, see <ref> [8, Theorem 8-20] </ref>. 2 4.3 State Space Stabilisation of Linear Systems with Saturation Having addressed the main method of determining the stability of nonlinear systems, we will now briefly examine the state space stabilisation problem for linear systems with saturation.

Reference-contexts: In Section 7.2, what are believed to be the first main results on the the continuity properties of linear systems with saturation are surveyed, taken from the paper by Chitour, Liu, and Sontag <ref> [9] </ref>. These results are given for a more specific class of plants, but the analysis gives a good characterisation of how the continuity of generic saturation functions affects the continuity of the closed loop. <p> Some examination is made of generalisations of the idea of incremental gain in order to make the analysis somewhat less conservative. The remainder of the chapter consists of new results which accentuate the negative findings of the paper <ref> [9] </ref>. The nonlinearity has been restricted to be the standard saturation, and for simplicity, the feedback loop has been forced to consist of unity negative feedback. In this case, it has been found that it is possible to bound the incremental gain using a conceptually simple linear matrix inequality problem. <p> Also, the construction used would indicate that such drastic loss of continuity would be exhibited by less conservative generalisations of the incremental 77 gain. 7.2 Results on the Continuity and Incremental Gain Properties of a Class of Linear Systems with Sat uration In the paper by Chitour, Liu and Sontag <ref> [9] </ref>, the continuity and incremental gain properties for continuous time neutrally stable systems are investigated. Some of the results are constructive, others rely on using counter-examples to show that postulated properties do not hold in general. The results will now be surveyed, after some preliminary definitions are given. <p> If each component of is non-decreasing, and n = 1, is globally Lipschitz with respect to L 1+ . 3. If 2 C 1;+ , is SLP p , Proof: See <ref> [9] </ref>. 2 The authors also deal with differentiability issues, the results on which are now given. Theorem 7.2.7: Take the operator as in Theorem 7.2.6. Then, 1. If 2 C 1;+ , is Frechet-differentiable with respect to L 1+ . 2. <p> Theorem 7.2.7: Take the operator as in Theorem 7.2.6. Then, 1. If 2 C 1;+ , is Frechet-differentiable with respect to L 1+ . 2. If 1 p &lt; 1, 2 C 1 and globally Lipschitz, is G^ateaux-differentiable with respect to L p+ . Proof: See <ref> [9] </ref>. 2 7.3 Bounding the Incremental Gain with the Stan dard Saturation By fixing the saturation function to be the standard saturation, it develops that one can bound the incremental gain by the use of the solution of a linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. <p> 7.4.4, and the definition of S M;p , we then have that: kP n+M (I P n1 )Ck p = ffS M;p : By the use of (7.7) (resp. (7.8)), k ~w wk p ff kuk p This contradiction proves Theorem 7.4.1.2 Remark 7.4.5: A similar construction is made in <ref> [9, Example 5] </ref> for a first order continuous time system, but the test signals can have an arbitrarily large L 1+ norm. 84 Remark 7.4.6: We have not specifically dealt with the case where p = 1, and (A) = 1.

Reference-contexts: However, there is a lack of uniqueness to the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equations unless added conditions are added on how the function behaves where it is non-differentiable. This problem was dealt with by the introduction of the notion of viscosity solutions by M.G. Crandall and P.-J. Lions in <ref> [11] </ref>. In this work, and that which has flowed from it, non-smooth analysis is used, using a generalisation of the derivative. Such lack of differentiability is a feature of the solutions to the computational method given in Chapter 5; this is due to the non-differentiability of the standard saturation function.

See also [55] and [61]. 2 In Section 8.2.2, a bound for the incremental gain of a specific system is derived from the use of the Small Gain Theorem.

Reference-contexts: And in fact, one can specialise further and examine n-th order integrators, as the problems arise from the order of the poles, rather than their location upon the imaginary axis. In his 1969 paper <ref> [16] </ref>, A.T. Fuller examined the stabilisation problem for integrator chains of various orders. He demonstrated that for first and second order integrators, there are linear state feedback controllers which globally stabilise the plant; however, third order and higher integrators are not globally stabilisable by purely linear state feedbacks.

Reference-contexts: The state space stability version of this problem has received extensive attention; the induced norm computation much less so. The work closest in spirit to that found herein is that in the paper <ref> [22] </ref> by J.W. Helton and W. Zhan. In that paper, the main study is of piecewise linear dynamics equations with one "break" in the function definition. The extension to having two "breaks" (such as occurs in the standard saturation) is obviously straightforward.

In that paper, the main study is of piecewise linear dynamics equations with one "break" in the function definition. The extension to having two "breaks" (such as occurs in the standard saturation) is obviously straightforward. The analysis in [22] is quite heavily tied to the viscosity solution dissipation theory, although the attempt is made to move away from numerical schemes relying upon discreti-sations over the state space. It is recognised that the solutions are close to being piecewise quadratic in nature. <p> It is recognised that the solutions are close to being piecewise quadratic in nature. The analysis is quite complicated, due to the necessity of piecing together the quadratic solutions along the boundary between the different operating regions. The results in <ref> [22] </ref> are explicitly described as being preliminary in nature. Gaining a better understanding of the computational problem is an ongoing research problem. For example, although a viscosity solution is known to exist from general principles, no guarantee is made that it will fit the class of piecewise quadratic functions given. <p> Although the author has not fully examined the problem, it is conjectured that the generic existence theorem equivalent to Theorem 5.6.8 could be easily extended for the class of systems studied in <ref> [22] </ref>. (Of course, this would again only be a sub-optimal characterisation.) In order to adapt the technique, the role of the function would be to attempt to force the solution to appear like the quadratic functions which are the result of the solution of the two appropriate Riccati equations.

Reference-contexts: Linear systems are the exception to this rule, and the computation is well adapted to solution on digital computers as will be discussed in Section 4.2.2. From an input/output based approach, the characterisation of the converse theorems found in the papers by Willems [55], and Hill and Moylan <ref> [23] </ref> are of interest to the present work. <p> J.C. Willems is generally credited with the introduction of dissipation functions in the control literature in [56, 57]. Additionally, he addressed the related topic of the generation of Lyapunov functions for input/output stable systems in [58]. Additional background work in this area appeared in the papers [36], <ref> [23] </ref>, [24], by D.J. Hill and P.J. Moylan. There has been a good deal of recent work on the problem of the computation of dissipation functions for the class of nonlinear affine systems (systems of the form _x (t) = f (x) + g (x)u). <p> These functions, and their theoretical importance was noted in [58], and <ref> [23] </ref>. The use of viscosity solutions has allowed numerical computation of these functions by the use of finite difference methods. Recent publications on this topic include the paper by M.R. James [27], and the text by W.H. Fleming and H.M.

Reference-contexts: The concern here is to give some form of state space convergence with inputs of non-compact support. One may also note the development of work similar to Willems in the paper by Hill and Moylan <ref> [24] </ref>. That paper is a study of the input/output problem when there may be multiple equilibria, a possibility which is not addressed here. Remark 3.6.3: We will now give an example as to why the L p -detectability definition is better suited than the uniform observability definitions used in [58],[24] for <p> J.C. Willems is generally credited with the introduction of dissipation functions in the control literature in [56, 57]. Additionally, he addressed the related topic of the generation of Lyapunov functions for input/output stable systems in [58]. Additional background work in this area appeared in the papers [36], [23], <ref> [24] </ref>, by D.J. Hill and P.J. Moylan. There has been a good deal of recent work on the problem of the computation of dissipation functions for the class of nonlinear affine systems (systems of the form _x (t) = f (x) + g (x)u). <p> The computation is reminiscent of the inverse Lyapunov theorems developed in the papers by Willems [57], and by Hill and Moylan <ref> [24] </ref>. In fact, the present treatment captures the Lyapunov results by letting fl tend to infinity (or setting (~) 0), just as the Riccati equation tends to the Lyapunov equation in linear system theory.

Reference-contexts: There are many differences from the corresponding linear computation problem, especially when unstable plants are allowed. In Section 5.2, results for neutrally stable plants will be reviewed, taken from the paper by Liu, Chitour and Sontag <ref> [33] </ref>. The results surveyed appear to be the first which directly addresses the norm computation problem for the plant input saturation configuration. The analysis takes in all L p+ norms, and with generic saturation nonlinearities, but at the cost of restriction of the plant and controller class. <p> This problem has been the subject of study of other researchers, and their (preliminary) results are noted. 5.2 Induced Norm Computation For Neutrally Stable Plants The recent paper by Liu, Chitour and Sontag <ref> [33] </ref> is one of the first to treat the norm computation problem of linear systems with saturation without using a small gain argument or relying on sector estimates. <p> It was the first set of results that allowed definite conclusions to be drawn with regards to the input/output stability of linear systems with poles on the imaginary axis which are stabilised by state feedback, the case where the Circle Criterion makes no prediction. In <ref> [33] </ref>, induced norm bounds are given for all L p+ norms (continuous time only is addressed). These bounds hold for all saturation functions. Also, the results hold for multiple input plants, a case which is not addressed in the new results detailed here. <p> These bounds hold for all saturation functions. Also, the results hold for multiple input plants, a case which is not addressed in the new results detailed here. However, in order to allow the level of generality in <ref> [33] </ref>, the analysis has been given in terms of a quite specific class of plants and controls, the plants being neutrally stable and a specific feedback controller fixed (a standard controller construction used in passivity arguments). <p> The main result of <ref> [33] </ref> will now be stated, with some simplifications (such as we assume here that the realisation is controllable as the preference here is to treat systems as arising from transfer functions). <p> There then exists an F 2 R mfin and an * &gt; 0 such that the operator mapping (u; v) to x generated by: x (0) = 0; is L p+ stable for all p 2 [1; 1].

In the paper by Liu, Chitour and Sontag <ref> [33] </ref>, the equivalence between state space and L p stability was derived from basic analysis of the signal sizes ([33, Section 6.1]). <p> Of course, the addition of extra states due to weighting functions will probably be quite unwelcome for any algorithms developed in the near future. 8.4 The Double Integrator We will now briefly comment on a result given the paper by Liu, Chitour and Sontag <ref> [33] </ref>. In that paper, they prove the following Proposition. 99 Proposition 8.4.1: Consider the system operator generated by: _x 1 (t) = x 2 ; x (0) = 0; with a; b &gt; 0. <p> Then the mapping w 7! x is not L p+ stable for all p 2 [1; 1]. Proof: This requires a fairly detailed analysis of test signals, and is done in <ref> [33, Section 8] </ref>. 2 As pointed out in [33], the system in the proposition is globally state space stable. This system provides a very good understanding as to the differences between linear and nonlinear systems when it comes to global properties. <p> Then the mapping w 7! x is not L p+ stable for all p 2 [1; 1].

The bound given by their analysis is that kk i;2 2 (1 + 1) k L k 1 = 4.

Reference-contexts: Proof: This theorem is a specialisation of standard results, for example see <ref> [45, Proposition C.3.8] </ref>. 2 Although local integrability implies that the signal is only (locally) in L 1 , this is sufficient for our purposes for all signals which are locally in L p+ , for p 1. <p> The criterion is usually credited to Kalman, and can be found in most basic texts discussing the state space theory of linear systems; for example, see [8], <ref> [45] </ref>.

It should perhaps also be noted that the text by Lyapunov is now available in an English translation [35]. <p> Then if x; y are trajectories with initial conditions x (0) = x 0 , y (0) = y 0 , then kx (t) y (t)k e t kx 0 y 0 k : Proof: This estimation result follows from the Bellman-Gronwall Inequality; see <ref> [45, Lemma C.3.1, Theorem 37] </ref>. 2 Lemma 5.6.6: If x (t; ~) 2 L 2+ for all x 2 , there then exists a finite constant T such that T = max ~2 T (~), with T : 7!

(In such a case, V is termed a valid Lyapunov function.) Proof: Found in <ref> [45, Chapter 4] </ref> (amongst others). 2 6.2.1 Linear Systems and the Algebraic Lyapunov Equation When the system of interest is linear, by assuming a quadratic form for the Lyapunov function, it is possible to give a necessary and sufficient test for uniform asymptotic stability in terms of a matrix algebraic equation. <p> Fix a realisation of P (s) = " C D , and then note that if the state trajectory is denoted x, then y (t) = Cx (t) + Du (t) over [0; T ]. However, one can then note the standard results on linear differential equations (as in <ref> [45, Section C.5] </ref>) give that x (t) is globally defined (as u is essentially bounded), and there exists a time dependent bound (expressed in terms of e AT ) for the growth of x.

Reference-contexts: Hill and P.J. Moylan. There has been a good deal of recent work on the problem of the computation of dissipation functions for the class of nonlinear affine systems (systems of the form _x (t) = f (x) + g (x)u). The paper by A.J. van der Schaft <ref> [51] </ref> has provided the inspiration for the dissipation technique used in this work, although obviously it requires some adaptation as the main effect of the nonlinearity here is that the input is no longer affine. <p> This is a long established technique in linear system theory, and gives rise to the algebraic Riccati equation. For nonlinear affine systems, a recent usage of the technique appears in <ref> [51] </ref>. However, the result will be slightly recast in terms of its notation to make the result more useful for our purposes. <p> Then, H (~; !) = (fl 2 kDk ) k! K (~) (~)k + (~); and hence H (~; !) 0 if and only if (~) 0. Proof: (Although done in <ref> [51] </ref>, the algebra is reproduced here for convenience) H (~; !) (~) = 2 dx fi fi ~ 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 dV fi fi fi B + D 0 h (~) kDk K (~) A ! 1 2 fl fl fl dx fi fi ~ 2 fl <p> The first order integrator with input saturation will once again be examined, but we will now synthesize a general nonlinear (state) feedback, using two different approaches. The first technique uses partial differential inequalities, following the sort of technique developed by A.J. van der Schaft in <ref> [51] </ref>. The second technique is similar in principle to the most basic anti-windup schemes, as the controller is fixed to be piecewise linear, and then algebraic conditions solved to fix the value of free parameters. <p> We take the plant to be controlled as: _x (t) = 0 (K (x (t)) + w (t)); 8.6.1 Controller Synthesis Using Partial Differential Inequalities The analysis here follows closely that given in <ref> [51] </ref>, and is of a preliminary nature. It may be possible to solve the state feedback problem using dynamic programming methods, however the preference is once again is to see whether more class specific algorithms may be developed. <p> An interesting issue arises as a consequence of the behaviour of a with fl = 1. The synthesis does not take advantage of the fact that the A:2 (~) A:1 (~), and hence is a weaker condition. It that if we are extend the methods in <ref> [51] </ref>, this issue will have to be seriously examined if the controller performance is to be satisfactory. 8.6.2 Synthesis of a Piecewise Linear Controller The control synthesised by the straight use of partial differential inequalities may be unsatis factory, however. <p> The results can be summarised as saying that the induced 2-norm of linear systems with the standard saturation is bounded below by that for the local linearisation. Such a result is not surprising, and for nonlinear affine systems, it is shown in the paper by A.J. van der Schaft <ref> [51, Proposition 6] </ref>. However, there are technical differences present (i.e., we are precisely not affine in the input), and the given proofs here seem quite elegant from an operator theoretic point of view.

Reference-contexts: Linear systems are the exception to this rule, and the computation is well adapted to solution on digital computers as will be discussed in Section 4.2.2. From an input/output based approach, the characterisation of the converse theorems found in the papers by Willems <ref> [55] </ref>, and Hill and Moylan [23] are of interest to the present work. <p> Proof: Originally in [60] the full version of this statement was noted but the proof disregarded (presumably for presentation/space reasons), the following proof is given in the text by Willems <ref> [55] </ref> (which gives a fairly exhaustive treatment of the operator theoretic definition of stability). To prove the statement, we need to show that we can solve x = x + u for all u 2 M . <p> For more details, see <ref> [55] </ref>. 2 It will be seen in Chapter 7 that having a finite incremental gain is a strong property; in order for the analysis to be somewhat less conservative, the induced norm version of the Theorem needs to be used, and the existence/uniqueness/causality conditions established separately. 4.4.2 Closed Loop Stability and <p> Proof: This characterisation was largely taken from [52, Section 6.7]; the characterisation used here of the Nyquist Locus was taken from Frederick and Carlson [15, Section 11.2]. See also <ref> [55] </ref> and [61]. 2 In Section 8.2.2, a bound for the incremental gain of a specific system is derived from the use of the Small Gain Theorem. In order to derive the bound, the technique of loop shifting is used. <p> Small Gain Estimate The first basic approach is to use the estimate provided by the small gain theorem, equivalent to the Circle Criterion. The means by which the estimate is made is via the use of loop shifting, a tactic long used in this situation (for example, see <ref> [55, Section 6.2] </ref>). Loop transformations are the usual means of proving the Circle Criterion, and so the details are of enough interest to be given here.

The computation is reminiscent of the inverse Lyapunov theorems developed in the papers by Willems <ref> [57] </ref>, and by Hill and Moylan [24]. In fact, the present treatment captures the Lyapunov results by letting fl tend to infinity (or setting (~) 0), just as the Riccati equation tends to the Lyapunov equation in linear system theory.

Reference-contexts: It appears that this detectability condition is non-standard; as most approaches focus either solely on state space or operator stability. One of the closest definitions used is that by Willems in <ref> [58] </ref>, which he terms uniform observability. This amounts to a similar condition to that given here, but with no external input. His definition is aimed at the generation of Lyapunov functions which are used to show state space stability. <p> J.C.
