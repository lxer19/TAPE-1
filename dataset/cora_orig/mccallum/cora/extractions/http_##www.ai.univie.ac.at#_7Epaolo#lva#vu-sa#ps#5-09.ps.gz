Abstract: i+1 ; signs an annotation for the forwarding hop S i ! S i+1 : S i supplies the list of signed annotations for each hop in the agent's path to S i+1 : S i+1 authenticates the path of the agent by authenticating each signed hop annotation. As the path grows, the cost of authenticating the digital signatures becomes prohibitive, but each server is relieved of the need to trust the authentication procedures of its predecessors. Similar path analysis issues arise in the problem of policy routing in computer networks [ Breslau and Estrin 1991 ] . Policy routing differs, because it is possible to specify the route of a message in advance and the intermediate servers do not execute the message. Simplifying cases, in addition to two-hop boomerang agents, may exist for multi-hop agents. If there are practical situations where the execution servers can be completely trusted, the security analysis reduces to establishing trust for the agent. The appeal of this scenario has motivated much of the safe language work and the proxy server idea suggested by [ Berghoff et. al, 1996 ] and [ Lingnau and Drobnik, 1995 ] . In situations where the agent can be completely trusted, it may not matter where the agent has been. This occurs if the agent does not acquire state as it travels but delivers a self-contained service to each server it visits. The agent propagates through the network more efficiently by hopping from server to server, or by replicating itself at each server visited. The agent can carry a digital signature to indicate that it is being delivered unaltered to the server. There may even be beneficial environments where neither the agent nor the server need to be trusted, i.e. beneficial trustless environments. For example, traveling games and other forms of entertainment can be executed from volatile memory on servers with user interfaces, e.g. TV monitors, but no other resources or assets. Misbehaving agents are simply erased from memory. Services provide agents for free, or require an inexpensive monthly fee and simple authentication of the user's subscription to the service. Users cancel the service if agents are generally unsatisfactory. Detailed work on these special cases will illu Drew Dean and Dan Wallach. Security Flaws in the HotJava Browser.
