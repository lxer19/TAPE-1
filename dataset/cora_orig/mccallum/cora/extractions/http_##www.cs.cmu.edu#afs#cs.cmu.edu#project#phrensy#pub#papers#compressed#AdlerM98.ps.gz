Abstract: In this paper we examine the problem of sending an n-bit data item from a client to a server across an asymmetric communication channel. We demonstrate that there are scenarios in which a high-speed link from the server to the client can be used to greatly reduce the number of bits sent from the client to the server across a slower link. In particular, we assume that the data item is drawn from a probability distribution D that is known to the server but not to the client. We present several protocols in which the expected number of bits transmitted by the server and client are O(n) and O(H(D) + 1), respectively, where H(D) is the binary entropy of D (and can range from 0 to n). These protocols are within a small constant factor of optimal in terms of the number of bits sent by the client. The expected number of rounds of communication between the server and client in the simplest of our protocols is O(H(D)). We also give a protocol for which the expected number of rounds is only O(1), but which requires more computational effort on the part of the server. A third technique provides a tradeoff between the computational effort and the number of rounds. These protocols are complemented by several lower bounds and impossibility results. We demonstrate that all of our protocols are existentially optimal in terms of the number of bits sent by the server, i.e., there are distributions for which the total number of bits exchanged has to be at least n. In addition, we show that there is no protocol that is optimal for every distribution (as opposed to just existentially optimal) in terms of bits sent by the server. We demonstrate this by proving that it is undecidable to compute (even approximately), for an arbitrary distribution D, how many expected bits need to be exchanged by the server and client on the distribution D.

Here, a and b are integers chosen uniformly and independently at random from the range [0 : : :2 n 1], and thus the total number of bits required to describe any F 2 F n is 2n.

Reference-contexts: The protocol we use proceeds in phases. During phase i, we check to see if the string is in the set X i . We can compare the partition of the strings into the sets X i with the construction of a Fano code [4] (see also <ref> [3] </ref>). To construct a Fano code, the strings are likewise sorted in order of probability, and then divided into as close to two equally probable sets as possible.

Let E (t) be the expected codeword length using the code t on a string x i drawn from the distribution D. Using an argument similar to the proof of Theorem 1, we show that E (t ) = O (H (D) + 1).

Reference-contexts: sent by the client across the low-speed uplink to significantly less than n. 1.1 Reducing the number of bits sent by the client Classical coding techniques for reducing the expected number of bits sent across a communication channel include source codes such as Shannon codes [21] and static Huffman codes <ref> [5] </ref>. These codes can be used when the string x to be sent is drawn randomly from a probability distribution D known to both the client and the server. <p> If the server starts by transmitting the entire distribution to the client, then by using a static Huffman coding scheme <ref> [5] </ref>, the string can be transferred in one round with at most H (D) + 1 expected bits sent by the client. However, such a scheme can be completely impractical since the number of bits the server has to send to the client can be exponential in n.

Reference-contexts: After the server has collected a sample of the data items, it is able to make an approximation to the distribution D of future data items to be sent, (see <ref> [6] </ref> for a good survey on techniques for this) but the clients do not gain any such information. This paper addresses the situation where the server has information about the string being sent that is not known to the client.

Reference-contexts: There is a wealth of literature on two-party communication complexity. Most of this work, however, examines symmetric communication channels, and analyzes the total number of bits transmitted by the two parties, and sometimes the number of rounds. A good reference is the recent book by Kushilevitz and Nisan <ref> [9] </ref>. There is relatively little work on asymmetric communication complexity. One notable exception is a body of work connecting asymmetric communication complexity to lower bounds on the time to perform operations on various data structures [13, 14]. The paper [14] is most closely related to this one.

Reference-contexts: In many cases, the server sends the client a message of length k, where the client does not know the value of k. In scenarios where k needs to be explicitly specified, we use self-delimiting strings <ref> [10] </ref>. A message of length k is sent using k + O (log k) bits. The effect of these additional bits on the analysis is negligible, and is ignored. <p> We show that OP T desc (D), or even any approximation to OP T desc (D), is not a recursive function. For such a proof, we use Kolmogorov complexity: the following proof is an extension of Kolmogorov's proof (see for example <ref> [10] </ref>) that the Kolmogorov complexity of a string is not a recursive function. Recall that the Kolmogorov complexity of a string x, which we here denote K (x), is the minimum description length of the string x.

Reference-contexts: Also, note that with this construction, for any k &lt; n, the first k bits of F (x) also forms a pairwise independent hash function (see for example <ref> [11] </ref>). Within our protocol, the client computes the value of F (x), for some F chosen randomly by the server. Within phase i of the protocol, the client and the 10 server check to see if x 2 X i .

In our framework, this would require that in the distribution D, all inputs x that are possible occur with the same probability.
