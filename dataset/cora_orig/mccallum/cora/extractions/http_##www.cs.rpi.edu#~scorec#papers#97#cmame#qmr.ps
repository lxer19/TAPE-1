Abstract: We present a variant of the Quasi-Minimal Residual (QMR) algorithm of Freund and Nachtigal with a preconditioner based on the Algebraic Multilevel (AMLI) algorithm of Axelsson and Vassil-evski. This combination provides an effective solution method for indefinite algebraic systems and is tested by application to finite element discretizations of the Helmholtz equation. The implementation is applicable with both hand p- refinements, and easily extends to a parallel environment.

Reference-contexts: Additionally, algebraic coarsening is used to define spatially hierarchical domains from irregular meshes of tetrahedral elements and static condensation <ref> [5] </ref> is used to remove the interior modes of high-degree (p &gt; 3) basis functions from the iterative portion of the solution procedure. Both additions improve efficiency for high levels of p-refinement, decreasing both the number of iterations and the per iteration cost of the algorithm. <p> The simplest form of (10) occurs for = 1 when ~ A (k+1) = M (k) ; however, Axelsson and Vassilevski [6,7] suggest selections with &gt; (1 fl 2 ) 1 6 The parameter fl is described by Axelsson and Barker <ref> [5] </ref> and will be discussed in Section 4. While the software can handle various B 11 (k+1) approximations to A 11 (k+1) , the examples of Section 4 all used the Gauss-Seidel method. This algorithm meets our criteria for parallel efficiency and is simple to implement in a serial code. <p> 18 30 5 3 h 56 60 4.1 Determination of Axelsson and Vassilevski [6,7] show that selecting according to (12) minimizes the number of iterations to convergence (subject to their assumptions), 12 where fl represents the orthogonality of the basis functions added during en-richment level k with those added previously <ref> [5] </ref>. We conducted several tests to measure the sensitivity of (12) under our modifications and for hand p-refinement. Considering Test Case 4 (with k = 1), Figure 5a shows the number of QMR iterations to convergence versus p for various . The figures indicate little benefit in selecting &gt; 2.

Reference-contexts: Part of this undesired increase can be attributed to the change in the growth rate of the number of iterations to convergence. However, looking closely at the cost C k of an iteration at level k we find <ref> [6] </ref> C k = O (C A (k) ) + O ( k1 C 1 ) (27) with C A (k) representing the cost of a multiplication with matrix A (k) and C 1 representing the cost of the coarsest level solution.

Reference-contexts: When B 11 (k+1) is sufficiently close to A 11 (k+1) , (k+1) B 11 (k+1) can be set to zero in (7) and (8) without a significant impact on the convergence rate of the iterative method <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: There is other potentially useful information embedded within the geometry of the mesh. Bank and Xu <ref> [8] </ref> provide an algorithm for coarsening a two-dimensional mesh based on finding logical parents for each finer point. <p> This algorithm limits the number of coarse nodes used to interpolate each fine node to two, while our algorithm allows this number to grow with the number of nonzero entries in each row of a given level A (k) . An adaptation of Bank and Xu's <ref> [8] </ref> algorithm to a parallel, three-dimensional mesh could further improve our h-refinement results. (v) Our algorithm was designed with a parallel implementation in mind and we believe performance on a parallel computer will be quite good; however, this must be verfied.

Reference-contexts: Entities do not overlap and the union of all regions define the discretized domain . This organization has advantages for local mesh operations including hand p- refinement and parallel mesh distribution. 3 Algorithm The solution strategy is based on the QMR algorithm of Freund and Nachti-gal <ref> [14] </ref> with preconditioning based on the Algebraic Multilevel Preconditioner (AMLI) of Axelsson and Vassilevski [6,7].

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, these results do not hold in three dimensions. With H 4 a measure of subdomain size, Ainsworth [2,3] and Guo and Cao <ref> [16] </ref> show that the condition number of systems arising from two-dimensional elliptic problems can be bounded by a polynomial function in log (H=h) for h-refinement and in log (p) for p-refinement using a domain decomposition type precondi-tioner.

Reference-contexts: The resulting system is symmetric, but indefinite. With a piecewise linear basis (p = 1), the domain should be discretized to approximately 10 elements per solution wavelength for acceptable accuracy <ref> [17] </ref>. Increasing p improves this lower bound, but the initial mesh spacing h 0 must satisfy kh 0 &lt; 1 [1,17,18]. These restrictions imply a need for a large initial spatial mesh and a quickly growing problem size during three-dimensional hand p- refinement.

Reference-contexts: This problem illustrates the behavior of our procedure without numerical difficulties arising from curvilinear domain geometry or numerical dispersion error arising from high wave numbers <ref> [18] </ref>. A representative spatial discretization of the region is given in Figure 4a. This problem could be attacked more efficiently by using an iterative method tailored to symmetric, positive definite systems. Example 2.

Reference-contexts: Pavarino and Widlund <ref> [21] </ref> show similar polylogarithmic bounds for domain decomposition methods in three dimensions using spectral element formulations. These domain decomposition methods employ a coarse problem based on the subdomain discretization to effectively transmit error information across the disjoint spatial domains.

Reference-contexts: The underlying data of this suite combines a geometric model of the physical domain obtained from CAD systems with a hierarchical mesh database <ref> [23] </ref>. 2 This arrangement makes geometric data available during the computation without requiring complete integration of the discrete and physical models. The mesh is a hierarchical structure of region, face, edge and vertex entities [10,23]. Each entity is associated with one or more of its components. <p> Each test uses an spatial mesh created by our mesh generator and the meshes for test cases 2, 4 and 6 satisfy kh 0 &lt; 1. The applicable form of the equations have been discretized on these meshes using hierarchical polynomial shape functions <ref> [23] </ref> and integrated using mapped Gaussian quadrature [12]. Spatial refinement is accomplished using linear polynomials (p = 1) across several uniformly refined meshes. All results were obtained by converging the iterative solution to a relative tolerance of 10 08 . (a) (b) Fig. 4. <p> Uniform refinement of the Level 3 mesh for Test Case 3 resulted in a mesh that was too large for our facilities. The growth in unknowns with p-refinement is, as expected, O (p 3 ) since the internal shape-function modes dominate as p ! 1 <ref> [23] </ref>. Ideally, the solution cost should increase slowly with the number of unknowns. The cost of an iterative method is the product of the per iteration cost and the number of iterations to convergence.

Reference-contexts: The underlying mesh is unstructured and finer elements are not nested within coarser ones. Although the results presented herein have been obtained by serial computation, the ease and efficiency of a parallel implementation is an important issue. Direct methods are not competitive under these constraints <ref> [25] </ref>, and we choose to solve (1) using an iterative method. These methods are efficient for parallel implementation, requiring only distributed matrix-vector and vector products and avoiding the fill in associated with factorization methods [26]. <p> This compares favorably to the O (n 3 ) time of direct methods for full matrices when m is significantly less than n, and remains competitive with sparse direct procedures requiring O (n 3 ) factorization time <ref> [25] </ref>. After briefly describing the adaptive and parallel computational framework (Section 2), we describe the implementation of the iterative quasi-minimal residual (QMR) solution procedure and the adaptive multilevel (AMLI) preconditioning in Section 3. The description includes modifications making the AMLI algorithm appropriate for unstructured hand p-refinement strategies.

These methods are efficient for parallel implementation, requiring only distributed matrix-vector and vector products and avoiding the fill in associated with factorization methods <ref> [26] </ref>. They can provide an approximate solution having a time complexity of O (n i m), where n is the rank of A, 1 i 2 correctly models the asymptotic cost of a sparse matrix-vector multiply, and m is the number of iterations performed.
