Title: Fractal Estimation using Models on Multiscale Trees  
Author: Paul W. Fieguth Alan S. Willsky 
Abstract: In this paper we estimate the Hurst parameter H of fractional Brownian motion (or, by extension, the fractal exponent ' of stochastic processes having 1=f ' -like spectra) by applying a recently-introduced multiresolution framework. This framework admits an efficient likelihood function evaluation, allowing us to compute the maximum likelihood estimate of this fractal parameter with relative ease. In addition to yielding results that compare well to other proposed methods, and in contrast to other approaches, our method is directly applicable, with at most very simple modification, in a variety of other contexts including fractal estimation given irregularly sampled data or nonstationary measurement noise and the estimation of fractal parameters for 2-D random fields.

Reference-contexts: In addition, by using a quadtree rather than a dyadic tree we can also apply these techniques in 2-D.

Reference-contexts: Previous estimators have been developed addressing this problem, notably those of Wornell and Oppenheim [11], Kaplan and Kuo [4], Tewfik and Deriche [10], and Flandrin <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Our approach and that of [11] fall into the former category, while the methods in <ref> [3, 4, 9] </ref> fall into the latter. In particular the approach in [11] is based on a 1=f -like process constructed using wavelets in which the wavelet coefficients are independent, with variances that vary geometrically with scale with exponent H. <p> The elements which remain to be determined in the above multiscale model are the g (s; H): the variance of the detail wavelet coefficient at each node s. Expressions for the statistics of the wavelet decomposition of fBm have been determined by others <ref> [3, 9] </ref>, however the self-statistics for the special case of the Haar wavelet are easily computed as follows: * Let B o [k] = B [k] which is the fBm process of interest. * Define B m [k] as the process obtained by coarsening B [k] m times, B m [k] <p> c j c i+j = g 2 where F is the covariance function of F [k]: F [i] = 2 ji + 1j 2H + ji 1j 2H 2jij 2H (t) 2H (14) It should be noted that the result in (13) is equal to the variance (50),(51) derived in <ref> [3] </ref>. By way of comparison, in [11] an exponential variation with scale for g m was proposed for estimating the fractal exponent ' of 1=f ' processes. <p> The bias in the estimator of [11] for low H, as was argued earlier based on Table 1, is evident. Also recall that the multiscale model of (6),(7) assumed the wavelet detail coefficients to be uncorrelated; this assumption becomes progressively poorer as H increases <ref> [3] </ref>, leading to an increase in the error variance for our estimator at large H. Nevertheless, our method still performs reasonably well over quite a wide range of values of H.

Moreover, using the techniques developed in <ref> [5] </ref>, we can construct higher-order multiscale models which account for most of the residual correlation in the wavelet coefficients. However since fBm itself is an idealization, the benefit in practice of such higher-order models over that based on the low-order model (6),(7) depends upon the application.
