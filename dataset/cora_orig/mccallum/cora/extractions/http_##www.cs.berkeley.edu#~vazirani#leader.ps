Abstract: In this paper, we study the leader election problem in the full information model. We show two results in this context. First, we exhibit a constructive O(log N) round protocol that is resilient against linear size coalitions. That is, our protocol is resilient against any coalition of size less then fiN for some constant (but small) value of fi. Second, we provide an easy, non-constructive probabilistic argument that shows the existence of O(log N ) round protocol in which fi can be made as large as 1 2 * for any positive *. Our

This model is characterized by the following two "worst case" assumptions. First, that all communication is public and mad via broadcast channels. That is, no two players share a private communication channel.

Reference-contexts: This stipulation rules out the use of cryptographic assumptions. 3 The constructive protocol The protocol first constructs a collection C of committees. The committees are constructed by choosing an explicit constant degree d expander graph on N + o (N ) vertices (for example, see <ref> [GG-79] </ref>). Each player is represented by some vertex in the expander graph. Each committee is composed of the players represented by different vertices in a k log N long walk on the expander graph where k is a fixed constant.

A widely known result due to Kahn, Kalai and Linial <ref> [KKL-88] </ref>, implies that if each player were restricted to providing one random bit, then 1= log N is the largest possible 2 value of fi for any one round protocol. Since then, protocols were designed that were resilient against larger and larger coalitions [S-89, AL-89, AN-90, BN1-93, BN2-93].

Reference-contexts: We note that Gillman's bound is somewhat weaker than the standard Chernoff bound in the sense that should ideally be close to 1=2.
