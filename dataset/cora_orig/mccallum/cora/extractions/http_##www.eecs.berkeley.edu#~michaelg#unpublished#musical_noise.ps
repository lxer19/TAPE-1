Abstract: This research proposal deals with the analysis and synthesis of musical stochastic processes such as the breath noise of a flute or the bow noise of a violin. Music synthesized without the appropriate noise tends to sound artificial; a stochastic component is necessary to give realism to electronic music synthesis. The proposal is organized as follows. First, a frequency-domain analysis-synthesis system is discussed. At the analysis stage in this system, the noise is extracted from a musical sound according to a stochastic-deterministic signal model; it is then parameterized in the frequency domain according to the energy in each of the auditory critical bands. At the synthesis stage, the noise is reconstructed spectrally and merged with a spectral version of the deterministic signal; then, the output is derived by an inverse FFT followed by an overlap-add process. Simulations have verified that the critical band energies provide an efficient and perceptually viable representation of broadband noise; this method is inadequate for narrowband noise, however. A harmonic filter-bank approach for the analysis and synthesis of nar-rowband noise is proposed; an alternative synthesis based on envelope and phase modulation functions is also presented. This narrowband noise method can be efficiently incorporated into the frequency-domain system independent of the critical band approach. The resultant broadband/narrowband noise decomposition is a starting point for the development of other algorithms for stochastic process analysis and synthesis.

Reference-contexts: 1. SIGNAL MODEL A common model for musical signals consists of a deterministic component and a stochastic component <ref> [1] </ref>: The deterministic component d (t) consists of a sum of sinusoids referred to as partials: d (t) = q=1 where Q is the number of partials, and where A q (t), ! q (t), and q (t) are the amplitude, frequency, and phase of the q-th partial at time t.

Reference-contexts: An equivalent synthesis can be achieved in the frequency domain <ref> [8] </ref>. 2. FREQUENCY-DOMAIN ADDITIVE SYNTHESIS Analysis-synthesis systems for musical applications are generally designed to allow modification of the analysis parameters to yield a desired effect, for instance a pitch shift or a time scaling. <p> Along with a computational advantage, additive synthesis in the frequency domain provides modification capabilities beyond those of the time-domain oscillator approach <ref> [8, 9] </ref>; in other words, the spectral representation derived from the analysis parameter tracks is a more flexible representation than the tracks themselves. 1 The frequency-domain synthesis relies on the equivalence of time domain multiplication and frequency domain convolution.

Reference-contexts: weighted version of B (!) centered around ! q is accumulated into the spectrum for each partial; the computation is reduced by exploiting the conjugate symmetry of the spectrum and by choosing b [n] such that B (!) can be well-represented by only the bins in its main spectral lobe <ref> [10, 11] </ref>. Then, the spectrum undergoes an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) to yield the signal b [n]d [n], from which the frame of d [n] can be extracted by dividing out the window b [n].

Reference-contexts: Frequency matching of adjacent frames can be achieved by synthesizing chirps (sinusoids with linearly increasing or decreasing frequency) in each frame instead of constant frequency sinusoids; here, the spectrum is constructed by accumulating components that represent windowed chirps instead of windowed sinusoids <ref> [12] </ref>. 3. THE STOCHASTIC COMPONENT Using the analysis-synthesis described, the deterministic signal component d (t) can be parameterized and synthesized. It tends to sound artificial, however, because the sinusoidal parameters do not adequately describe the entire musical sound; it fails to characterize noiselike features such as breathiness.

Reference-contexts: In this signal model, all of the time-varying sinusoidal components are considered part of the deterministic signal. In a later section, this model will be drawn into question in light of the fact that nar-rowband noise can be expressed as a sinusoid with slowly varying amplitude and phase <ref> [13] </ref>. The distinction between narrowband and broadband noise will be examined there. At this point, it suffices to simply consider the residual a broadband process. The following sections present an analysis-synthesis technique intended specifically for broadband noise. 4. <p> ENVELOPE-PHASE NOISE SYNTHESIS Another approach to narrowband noise synthesis arises from a consideration of classical representations of noise. It can be shown that any random process can be expressed in quadrature form as <ref> [13] </ref> s [n] = s c [n] cos [w 0 n + fl] s s [n] sin [w 0 n + fl] (37) where fl is an arbitrary phase angle, or equivalently as where R [n] = s c [n] 2 + s s [n] 2 (39) fi [n] = arctan <p> phase angle, or equivalently as where R [n] = s c [n] 2 + s s [n] 2 (39) fi [n] = arctan s s [n] (40) If s [n] is a narrowband noise, R [n] and fi [n] can be interpreted as a slowly varying envelope and phase, respectively <ref> [13] </ref>. Consider s q [n] to be a noise process with a nar-rowband psd S q (!) centered at ! q ; since the Q bands of the processes considered in section 8 are independent, the following approach can be applied individu ally to each of the Q bands.

Reference-contexts: energies of all the bands across the spectrum is precisely the signal energy of Parseval's Theorem: X E c = M a k=0 N a 1 X x [n] 2 (4) It should be noted here that the critical bands used are not precisely those detailed in the psychoa-coustics literature <ref> [14] </ref>. Rather, the bands are constructed according to four parameters: f low , the frequency below which C low bands are equally spaced; f high , the frequency above which there is only one band; and C, the total number of bands to be used.

Reference-contexts: A typical set of parameters for the noise analysis is f low = 400Hz, C low = 2, f high = 15000Hz, and C = 12. In the literature, a breakdown of 24 critical bands is indicated <ref> [15] </ref>. Listening experiments using this noise analysis-synthesis system indicate that for even coarser band configurations (such as C = 12), the ear is still primarily sensitive to the amount of energy in each band and not to the specific distribution of the energy within the bands.
