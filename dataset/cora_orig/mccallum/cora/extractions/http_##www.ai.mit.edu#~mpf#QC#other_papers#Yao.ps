Abstract: We study a complexity model of quantum circuits analogous to the standard (acyclic) Boolean circuit model. It is shown that any function computable in polynomial time by a quantum Turing machine has a polynomial-size quantum circuit. This result also enables us to construct a universal quantum computer which can simulate, with a polynomial factor slowdown, a broader class of quantum machines than that considered by Bernstein and Vazirani [BV93], thus answering an open question raised in [BV93]. We also develop a theory of quantum communication complexity, and use it as a tool to prove that the majority function does not have a linear-size quantum formula.

In this section, we answer an open question about simulating quantum machines raised by Berstein and Vazirani [BV93].

Reference-contexts: His discussions, however, centered mostly on the computability issue without regard to the complexity (i.e. cost) issue. A significant step towards better understanding the complexity issue in the quantum Turing model was taken by Bernstein and Vazirani <ref> [BV93] </ref>, who constructed an efficient universal quantum computer which can simulate a large class of quantum Turing machines with only a polynomial factor slowdown. In classical computation, Boolean circuit complexity has provided an important alternative framework than Turing complexity. <p> This result, somewhat unexpectedly, also allows us to construct a universal quantum computer which can simulate, with a polynomial factor slowdown, a broader class of quantum machines than that considered by Bernstein and Vazirani <ref> [BV93] </ref>, thus answering an open question raised in [BV93].

In this section, we answer an open question about simulating quantum machines raised by Berstein and Vazirani [BV93].

In this extended abstract, by quantum Turing machines we mean one-tape machines with its head allowed to move in each quantum step either to the right, or to the left, or stay in the same place. (For a formal specification, see <ref> [BV93] </ref>.) Theorems 1 and 2 can be extended to the standard variations of this model. (This will be discussed in the complete paper.) Theorem 3 There exists a universal quantum Turing machine that can simulate any given quantum Turing machine with only a polynomial slow-down. <p> One complication is that since a universal machine has only a finite set of transitions, one needs to perform approximate computations in the same way as was done in <ref> [BV93] </ref>. We omit the details in this extended abstract. 5 Quantum Communication Complexity Interacting quantum machines can be defined in several ways. We will only introduce a special model here which can be used to prove lower bounds on circuit complexity. <p> As is in the notation of <ref> [BV93] </ref>, ffi is the amplitude of M to change state to q 0 , print a 0 and move according to t , if the machine is currently in state q and reading tape symbol a. We construct a quantum circuit which is the concatenation of T identical subcircuits.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction One of the most intriguing questions in computation theroy (see e.g. Feynman [Fe82]) is whether computing devices based on quantum theory can perform computations faster than the standard Turing machines. Deutsch proposed a Turing-like model <ref> [De85] </ref> for quantum computations, and constructed a universal quantum computer that can simulate any given quantum machine (but with a possible exponential slowdown). He subsequently considered a network-like model, called quantum computational networks, and established some of their basic properties [De89].

A natural place to start is the framework of quantum computational networks as discussed in <ref> [De89] </ref>; these networks may be viewed as the quantum analog of conventional logical circuits (with feedback). In this paper, we single out the subclass of acyclic networks, and develop a complexity theory of quantum circuits analogous to the standard (acyclic) Boolean circuit model. <p> For work in quantum systems from the perspective of information theory, see for example, Kholevo [Kh73] and Schumacher [Schu90]. 2 2 Quantum Boolean Circuits In Deutsch <ref> [De89] </ref>, a quantum computation model different from that of quantum Turing machines was introduced. This is the quantum analog to the classical sequential logical circuits. <p> In essence, some set of elementary gates is chosen as a basis, where each elementary gate is some `-input `-output device specified by a 2 ` fi 2 ` unitary matrix U . The function of the gate needs to be understood in the context of quantum computation (see <ref> [De89] </ref>). We summarize it briefly. Let C d denote the vector space of d-tuples of complex numbers, equipped with an inner product &lt; u; v &gt;= P i v i for u; v 2 C d . <p> Let m denote the set of all m-input m-output quantum gates. Deutsch showed <ref> [De89] </ref> that, for n 3, any unitary transformation in C 2 n (as induced by n Boolean variables) can be computed by a computational network using 3 as a basis, and with only n wires (initially each wire contains one distinct input variable). <p> ij = 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise, h cc 0 = cos (=2) if c + c 0 is even and i sin (=2) if c + c 0 is odd. (See Figure 2 for the matrix explicitly exihibited.) This family of gates was introduced by Deutsch <ref> [De89] </ref> as an extension of the Toffoli gates (Toffoli [To81]) 4 for classical Boolean circuits. <p> For additional interesting members of 3 , see Deutsch <ref> [De89] </ref>. 3 Relationships with Turing Machines A quantum Boolean circuit K with n input variables is said to (n; t)-simulate a quantum Turing machine M , if the family of probability distributions p ~x , ~x 2 f0; 1g n generated by K is identical to the distribution of the configuration

Reference-contexts: We show that M AJ n have no linear-size quantum formula. Theorem 5 F Q (M AJ n )=n ! 1. To prove Theorem 5, we reduce the problem to one of communication complexity (using a Ramsey-type argument similar to those used by Hodes and Specker <ref> [HS68] </ref>), and then apply Theorem 4.
