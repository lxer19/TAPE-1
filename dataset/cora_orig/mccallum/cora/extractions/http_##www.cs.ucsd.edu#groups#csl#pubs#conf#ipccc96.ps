Abstract: Hierarchical coding of images and continuous media can be used to effectively control congestion in high-speed networks supporting interactive multimedia communications. However, the tradeoffs of the use of hierarchical coding have not yet been adequately investigated. We have undertaken an empirical study to investigate the effectiveness of hierarchical coding through the hierarchical mode of JPEG from a network perspective. A static analysis of hierarchical JPEG images in comparison to baseline JPEG images in terms of QoS management by packet discarding is provided in this paper. We also share our experiences in the implementation of hierarchical JPEG.

Reference-contexts: These compression ratios may vary slightly across HJPEG implementations (influenced by different upsamplers and downsamplers). These figures show far better performance than expected, considering the initial results 2 reported in <ref> [5] </ref>. 2 In [5], comparison was made between a 3-layer HJPEG image (downsampled by 2 in each direction for each frame) and the progressive mode of JPEG. The HJPEG image has about 33% overhead over the image coded with the progressive mode. <p> These compression ratios may vary slightly across HJPEG implementations (influenced by different upsamplers and downsamplers).

The RST (restart) marker, a synchronization flag, in the JPEG standard can be used to separate the entropy-coded segments for each interval and allow each segment to be decoded independently of other intervals in the scan <ref> [5] </ref>. This provision (the actual procedures are not defined by JPEG) can be utilized to resynchronize damaged blocks from packet loss as both encoders and decoders are reini-tialized at each interval. Thus, spatial error propagation in DC coefficients (which are differentially coded to reduce bit rate) is limited.
