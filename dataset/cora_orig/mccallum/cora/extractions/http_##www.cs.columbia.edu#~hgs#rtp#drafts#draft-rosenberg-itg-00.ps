Abstract: This memorandum discusses the issues and options involved in the design of a new transport protocol for multiplexed voice within a single packet. The intended application is the interconnection of devices which provide trunking or long distance telephone service over the Internet. Such devices have many voice connections simultaneously between them. Multiplexing them into the same connection improves on the efficiency, enables the use of low bitrate voice codecs, and improves scalability. Options and issues concerning timestamping, payload type identification, length indication, and channel identification are discussed. Several possible header formats are identified, and their efficiencies are compared.

Reference-contexts: This means that packets continually arrive, and that delay estimates obtained from those packets can be continuously generated. Algorithms for dynamically adapting the playout buffer at the receiver are based on these delay estimates <ref> [ 1] </ref>, and can now be reworked to utilize the continuous stream of delays, as opposed to relying on the delays received during talkspurts only. The result is likely to be an improvement in both end to end delay and loss performance.

Reference-contexts: This protocol must provide for the transport of multiple real time streams within a single IP packet. Since the intended application is real-time, the requirements for timing recovery, sequencing, and payload identification are nearly identical to normal single user voice. Since RTP was designed to meet these requirements <ref> [ 2] </ref>, it makes sense to build this new multiplexing protocol on top of RTP. In fact, RTP allows for different profiles to be defined for a particular application. The goal of this document is to define a variety of options for that new profile, and to compare them.

Reference-contexts: In fact, RTP allows for different profiles to be defined for a particular application. The goal of this document is to define a variety of options for that new profile, and to compare them. It is important to note that this application is similar in its requirements to <ref> [ 3] </ref>, which seeks to multiplex multiple encodings for a particular user into the same IP packet.

Reference-contexts: Rosenberg, H. Schulzrinne Expires: May 26, 1997 [Page 12] information at all. Even for non-frame based codecs, such as PCM, default data sizes can be set in the standard (as in RFC 1890 <ref> [4] </ref>). An extension bit can be used to indicate a nonstandard length, so that when set, a length field follows.
