Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The study of reductions of complexity classes to sparse sets has a long and rich history in complexity theory. The starting point of this research was provided by Berman and Hartmanis <ref> [BH77] </ref>, when, as a consequence of the famous isomorphism conjecture, they conjectured that NP-complete sets cannot be sparse. As a culmination of considerable previous work [Ber77, For79], Mahaney [Mah82] proved that if there exists a many-one hard sparse set for NP, then P = NP.

Reference-contexts: It is well-known that the class of all languages with (non-uniform) polynomial size circuits is precisely the class of languages that are polynomial-time Turing reducible to sparse sets.

The ultimate objective, going beyond this paper, is to understand the relationship between P and non-uniform NC 1 .

Reference-contexts: The next significant breakthrough was obtained by Ogihara [Ogi95], who showed that if there exists a sparse set that is hard for P under logspace many-one reductions, then P DSPACE [log 2 n]. Finally Cai and Sivakumar <ref> [CS95] </ref> settled Hartmanis' conjecture by showing that there are no sparse hard sets for P under logspace many-one reductions, unless P = LOGSPACE. Although the isomorphism conjecture was really about many-one completeness, there is an equally compelling reason to study weaker reducibilities. <p> The proof of this result relies on solving a system of equations where a fraction of the equations could be erroneous. We then 1 derandomize this algorithm, taking advantage of certain error-correcting capabilities of the "small-bias sample space" construction used in <ref> [CS95] </ref>. The generalization is not straightforward, however. It is an indication of the effectiveness of algebraic and derandomization techniques that the proof in [CS95] can be generalized to account for the case of bounded truth-table reductions. <p> We then 1 derandomize this algorithm, taking advantage of certain error-correcting capabilities of the "small-bias sample space" construction used in <ref> [CS95] </ref>. The generalization is not straightforward, however. It is an indication of the effectiveness of algebraic and derandomization techniques that the proof in [CS95] can be generalized to account for the case of bounded truth-table reductions. We note that in the NP case it took the research community 10 years to generalize Mahaney's result for many-one reducibility to Ogihara-Watanabe's theorem for bounded truth-table reducibility [OW91]. <p> Corollary 2 If there exists a sparse set that is hard for P under bounded truth-table reductions, then P RNC 2 . To prove Theorem 1 we need to prove an extended version of a probabilistic lemma of Cai and Sivakumar in <ref> [CS95] </ref>. Given a circuit C with n gates, and an input x, let g 1 ; : : : ; g n be the values output by the gates 1; 2; : : : ; n. Let B n denote the n-dimensional binary hypercube. <p> We will use a polynomial-sized set D of vectors I 2 B n . The set D will be the same as the one used in <ref> [CS95] </ref> for derandomizing the algorithm for the many-one case. This construction is formally identical to an error-correcting code [vL91] that is obtained by concatenating a certain Reed-Solomon code with a Hadamard code. We will use the error-correcting capabilities of this construction in a crucial way. <p> Thus, if dim L n O (log n), we would succeed since by sampling exhaustively in D, we would have obtained a system of linear equations of rank n O (log n), which can be solved in NC 2 (cf. <ref> [CS95] </ref>). Let k = 5 + log n + log p (n) = O (log n). We now consider two cases. Case 1. dim L n k. Then we can solve the problem, as illustrated in [CS95]. Case 2. dim L &lt; n k. <p> of rank n O (log n), which can be solved in NC 2 (cf. <ref> [CS95] </ref>). Let k = 5 + log n + log p (n) = O (log n). We now consider two cases. Case 1. dim L n k. Then we can solve the problem, as illustrated in [CS95]. Case 2. dim L &lt; n k. <p> If the first set of equations has sufficiently high rank n O (log n), then it will succeed. Otherwise the second set of equations will succeed. 4 Randomized many-one reductions We apply the techniques of Cai and Sivakumar <ref> [CS95] </ref> to the case of many-one reductions with one-sided error.

Reference-contexts: For definiteness, suppose m = n log n . Mulmuley's algorithm [Mul87] can be adapted to compute the rank of the above matrix, but we get a circuit of depth O (log 4 n). An earlier algorithm due to Chistov <ref> [Chi85] </ref> gives a nonuniform circuit of depth O (log 2 n log log n). We build upon these two algorithms and obtain a uniform circuit of depth O (log 2 n log log n) to compute the rank of the above matrix.

Reference-contexts: This is the parallel version of Turing reducibility. Indeed they are the most general kind of reductions computable by NC circuits as defined in <ref> [Coo85] </ref> (in contrast to the adaptive Turing reductions computable by Turing Machines). Under the assumption that P has a sparse hard set under logspace-computable bounded truth-table reductions, we first show that P RNC 2 . <p> The circuit value problem (CVP) is defined as follows: Given a boolean circuit C with m inputs and a binary string x of length m, compute the output of C with input x. Ladner [Lad75] showed that CVP is P-complete under logspace many-one reductions; Cook <ref> [Coo85] </ref> noted that if CVP is in NC 1 , then P = NC 1 . 3 Truth-table reductions We start by describing our results about sparse sets that are hard under truth-table reductions.
