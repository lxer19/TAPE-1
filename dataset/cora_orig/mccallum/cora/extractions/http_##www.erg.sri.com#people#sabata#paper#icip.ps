Abstract: A distributed system that supports applications with varying quality of service (QoS) requirements must use many adaptive mechanisms to guarantee performance to the applications. This paper presents the use of the mechanism of graceful adaptation for applications with multiple levels of performance. The different levels of performance use different amounts of resources. Our ERDoS architecture supports such mechanisms in order to provide end-to-end service guarantees to applications. The mechanism we present is based on the market control paradigm in which trade-offs are made between the different QoS dimensions of an application so as to satisfy the application's QoS needs under resource constraints.

Reference-contexts: For example, methods of hierarchically encoding images and video have been developed <ref> [11, 1, 9] </ref> that transmit a few layers of the hierarchy in order to reduce the total resource usage at the cost of reduced quality.

Reference-contexts: Amir, McCanne, and Katz <ref> [2] </ref> address this issue for a multi-cast conferencing application. They develop a model that assigns weight to the streams based on receiver interest in the multicast group. For any data stream, degradation can be done in many different ways.

Reference-contexts: The system-wide resource manager understands the structure of the system (using the system model) and the resource capabilities (using the individual resource models). The key element of the application model <ref> [3] </ref> is the logical application stream model (LASM), which describes the application structure in an application-independent manner. The specific invocation of an application instance, along with a user-specific benefit function, is captured in the application invocation model. <p> For example, streaming video application. The boxes correspond to the services that are the application components and the arrows correspond to the data and control flow of the application (see Chatterjee et al. <ref> [3] </ref> for details of the application model). The end-to-end QoS requirement of an application is represented via the benefit function. For example, in the case of the video application the benefit to the user of different frame sizes and different image compression qualities is shown in Figure 4 (a).

Reference-contexts: Such optimization problems arising from the distributed allocation of more than one resource are NP-complete. We can obtain only approximate solutions of this optimization problem. The mechanism we employ is based on modeling the system as a free market economy <ref> [4] </ref>. If the resources are commodities that are traded by the different applications to optimize the global benefit value, then local market based interactions can lead 1 to a stable solution. <p> The dual of the constrained optimization problem derived by using the method of Lagrange multipliers can be used to compute the solution. The free-market-based auction methods solve the dual problem, and the Lagrange multiplier is the price of the resource fixed by the auction <ref> [4] </ref>. 5 Market-Based Adaptation Our solution methodology for deciding between the different degradation strategies is modeled on a market-based economic protocol. Market-based economic protocols use the free market as a model to determine a solution to the optimization problem of Equation 1. <p> The optimization process is distributed and is guaranteed to converge to a global minimum if the problem satisfies certain convexity criteria. In the past, this procedure has been used by researchers for resource allocation, factory scheduling, and task allocation <ref> [4] </ref>. We have adapted the procedure to determine the QoS parameter setting of the application data. We use interactions between competing agents to model the market. An agent corresponds to an application. Each agent derives a benefit (and therefore generates value for the system) by consuming resources.

Reference-contexts: Data-compression-based techniques to reduce the volume of multimedia data transmitted over communication networks have been implemented in many systems including those described Hoffman and Speer [7]. In addition, mechanisms such as transcoding, filtering, and distillation <ref> [6, 12] </ref> manipulate data compression parameters and the amount of data that is transmitted in a content independent manner so as to reduce resource usage. In this paper we present representations that simplify the process of degradation.

Reference-contexts: A generalization of this formulation to multiple resources is presented in Sabata, Chatterjee and Sydir <ref> [8] </ref>. In the video transmission application, the the image compression quality QoS dimensions of each video stream that we consider are the size and the image quality of each frame. In general, each video stream has QoS parameters relating to frame size, frame rate, frame quality, color levels, and jitter.

Reference-contexts: We believe that a proactive system-wide entity, the resource manager, must implement a system's policies, coordinating application-, resource-, and system-level resource management decisions. In addition to the resource manager, ERDoS <ref> [10] </ref> has three key components: the application model, the system model, and the resource model (shown in Figure 1). The system-wide resource manager understands the structure of the system (using the system model) and the resource capabilities (using the individual resource models).
