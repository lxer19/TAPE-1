Abstract: Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are evolving towards a more cooperative relationship between the system and the student. More and more, learning is considered as a constructive process rather than a simple transfer of knowledge. This trend has brought to light new cooperative tutoring strategies. One of these tutoring strategies, the learning companion, designed to overcome some of the limitations of the classical tutoring model, involves a student and two simulated participants: a tutor and another student. More recently a new strategy, learning by disturbing, has been proposed. In this strategy, the simulated student is a troublemaker whose role is to deliberately disturb the human student. This article describes the learning by disturbing strategy by contrasting it with the learning companion strategy. In addition, some links are drawn between this new strategy and the psychology of learning, in particular the cognitive dissonance theory.

Reference-contexts: This prescriptive approach has evolved and is being replaced by a more constructive approach. It is therefore not surprising that in the late 80s ITS begin to model relationships other than the tutorstudent team. The first such approach was the co-learner strategy <ref> [1] </ref> which allows the student to work with a co-learner simulated by the system. Since there is no tutor, this strategy is most useful for discovery learning. In a second approach, initially proposed by Chan and Baskin [2], a tutor supervises the human student and a simulated companion.

Reference-contexts: The first such approach was the co-learner strategy [1] which allows the student to work with a co-learner simulated by the system. Since there is no tutor, this strategy is most useful for discovery learning. In a second approach, initially proposed by Chan and Baskin <ref> [2] </ref>, a tutor supervises the human student and a simulated companion. Initially, this companion was to act as a student with strengths and weaknesses comparable to the learner. In this respect, the companion has no pedagogical expertise. <p> Multiple agents that are either computer simulated or real human beings can work on the same computer or share a computer network. Chan and Baskin proposed a three-agent learning situation <ref> [2] </ref> which consists in a cooperation between a human learner and a simulated learning companion. They learn together under the guidance of the tutor. The companion and the learner perform the same task and exchange ideas on the problem.

Reference-contexts: Initially, this companion was to act as a student with strengths and weaknesses comparable to the learner. In this respect, the companion has no pedagogical expertise. The next step in this approach is to replace the companion with a troublemaker <ref> [3] </ref> who is no longer a simple simulation of a student but who has the pedagogical expertise necessary to maximise the impact of its interventions. In particular, the troublemaker can propose erroneous solutions to the learner so as to systematically test the students level of self-confidence. <p> The learner and the co-learner (the companion) work together and ask the tutor for help only if they cannot find a solution. The role of the tutor is to alternate between a presentation of problems and a critique of the learner's solution. The learning by disturbing strategy <ref> [3] </ref> suggests that the computer can simulate two agents: a tutor and a troublemaker. The level of competence of the troublemaker is superior that of the learner in order to provide reasonable competition. In adition it has some pedagogical knowledge which can help it to efficiently plan its interactions. <p> THE LEARNING BY DISTURBING STRATEGY In this section we describe the learning by disturbing strategy by : describing the participants and their roles, comparing the strategy with that of the learning companion, and finally, presenting the links with cognitive dissonance theory. 3.1 Description The troublemaker strategy implicates three participants <ref> [3] </ref> [6] : The tutor presents to the team of students both the lessons and the exercises to be solved. It is the tutor who controls both the content and the length of the session. <p> The troublemaker appears to be a simulation of a student working with the learner. In fact the troublemaker possesses both pedagogical expertise and a level of knowledge of the domain comparable to that of the tutor <ref> [3] </ref>. The troublemaker uses this pedagogical expertise to maximise the impact of its interventions. The role of the troublemaker is to unsettle the student by proposing solutions which are sometimes truthful but other times erroneous. This tests the students self-confidence and obliges him to defend his point of view. <p> Those who are accustomed to the learning companion strategy may well ask themselves : why do we need the learning by disturbing strategy? One justification is given in <ref> [3] </ref>: However, there is a need to test the self-confidence of the learner, to introduce a new form of motivation, to increase the degree of stimulation and to anchor the knowledge of the learner. However, each method presents benefits and weaknesses.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the troublemaker can propose erroneous solutions to the learner so as to systematically test the students level of self-confidence. In a sense the troublemaker can zero-in on the learners weaknesses and force the student to confront and overcome them. According to Festinger <ref> [4] </ref>, cognitive dissonance is an important factor in motivating a student. In perceiving a difference between his knowledge and that which the troublemaker suggests, the learner experiences cognitive dissonance. This psychological discomfort leads the student to either revise or defend his position and motivates him to learn. <p> Organisms are seen as needing to encounter stimulus events that are moderately discrepant from their accustomed stimulation. That is, an organism is intrinsically motivated by a need to encounter a moderate difference between his experience and his environment." Cognitive dissonance theory <ref> [4] </ref> develops this observation further. His definition of cognitive dissonance is the perception, by a subject, of a difference, of variable intensity, between that which has been previously perceived and learned and new information. This process is illustrated by figure 1. 1. Perception of information 2. <p> cognitive dissonance and internal motivation: "The existence of dissonance, being psychologically uncomfortable, will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve consonance. (...) In short, I am proposing that dissonance, that is the existence of non-fitting relations among cognitions, is a motivating factor in its own right." <ref> [4] </ref> A key feature of Festinger's theory is the expectations that the subject has.

Reference-contexts: Directive learning 3 This approach (also called one-on-one strategy) <ref> [5] </ref> preceded the cooperative systems and consists in having the computer simulate an intelligent tutor who can understand the learner and provide adaptive tutoring. The learner receives knowledge directly from the tutor who communicates and acts according to a prescriptive behaviour. 2.2.

Reference-contexts: This experiment, necessary to understand the impact of the troublemaker on different learners, is but a first step towards a true implementation of the strategy. A more recent version of the troublemaker which includes more interaction between the learner and the troublemaker is described in <ref> [7] </ref>. The different experiments mentioned here were conducted under the SAFARI project [8] 3.2 Qualitative comparison between the learning companion strategy and learning by disturbing The learning by disturbing strategy is relatively new and is still under development.

Reference-contexts: External motivation, which we do not focus on in this work, depends upon factors which are outside the student: performance, social acceptance, etc. Internal motivation is defined by Tardif <ref> [9] </ref> is a motivation 6 which comes from within an individual and accordingly the actions which this person undertakes correspond to needs, likes, or preferences which are specific to that person. In his description of the WEST system, Chan [10], highlights the two most significant factors in internal motivation.

Reference-contexts: Since a person does not have complete and perfect control over the information that reaches him and over events that can happen in his environment, such dissonance may easily arise." <ref> [11] </ref> An individual experiencing cognitive dissonance may lead to negative consequences: the individual may incorporate inconsistent and contradictory knowledge into his cognitive schemas and then use them in a dysfunctional manner. <p> Therefore all individuals will experience cognitive dissonance while interacting with their environment. A very common source is the interaction individuals have with other people: "When a person is confronted with an opinion contrary to its own which is held by people like himself, he experiences dissonance" <ref> [11] </ref>.
