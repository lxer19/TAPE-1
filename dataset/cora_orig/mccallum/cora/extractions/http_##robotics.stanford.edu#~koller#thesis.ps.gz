Reference-contexts: Using a higher fixed threshold in a straightforward way does not help. More successfully, Adams <ref> [Ada75] </ref>, and later Geffner and Pearl [GP90], suggested an interpretation of defaults based on "almost all". In their framework, this is done using extreme probabilities | conditional probabilities that are arbitrarily close to 1: i.e., within 1 * for some *, and considering the limit as * ! 0.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, Rational Monotonicity does not suffice even in this less controversial case. Indeed, there are well-known systems that satisfy Rational Monotonicity but cannot conclude that Tweety, the yellow penguin, is easy to see [LM92, Pea90]. This problem has been called the drowning problem <ref> [Ash93, BCD + 93] </ref>. Theories of default reasoning have had considerable difficulty in capturing an ability to inherit from superclasses that can deal properly with all of these different cases. In particular, the problem of inheritance to exceptional subclasses has been the most difficult.

Reference-contexts: As we suggested above, we want to deal with rich knowledge bases that allow not only first-order information, but statistical information and default information. To do this, we use a variant of the language introduced by Bacchus <ref> [Bac90] </ref>. Bacchus's language augments first-order logic by allowing statements of kHep (x)jJaun (x)k x = 0:8, which says that 80% of patients with jaundice have hepatitis. Notice 4 CHAPTER 1. <p> Chapter 3 The formalism 3.1 The language We are interested in a formal logical language that allows us to express both statistical information and first-order information. We therefore define a statistical language L , which is a variant of a language designed by Bacchus <ref> [Bac90] </ref>. For the remainder of the thesis, let be a finite first-order vocabulary, consisting of predicate and constant symbols, and let X be a set of variables. 1 Our statistical language augments standard first-order logic with a form of statistical quantifier. <p> Finally, any rational number is also considered to be a proportion expression, and the set of proportion expressions is closed under addition and multiplication. One important difference between our syntax and that of <ref> [Bac90] </ref> is the use of approximate equality to compare proportion expressions. As we argued in the introduction, exact comparisons are sometimes inappropriate. <p> Notice that this definition allows arbitrary nesting of quantifiers and proportion expressions. In Section 3.3 we demonstrate the expressive power of the language. As observed in <ref> [Bac90] </ref>, the subscript x in a proportion expressions binds the variable x in the expression; indeed, we can view jjjj x as a new type of quantification. We now need to define the semantics of the logic. As we shall see below, most of the definitions are fairly straightforward.

Reference-contexts: The proof of (ii), and hence the theorem, now follows. It now remains to prove Lemma D.2.3. As we hinted earlier, this requires tools from algebraic geometry. We base our definitions on the presentation in <ref> [BCR87] </ref>. A subset A of IR ` is said to be semi-algebraic if it is definable in the language of real-closed fields. <p> The main tool we use is the following Curve Selection Lemma (see <ref> [BCR87, p. 34] </ref>): Lemma D.2.4: Suppose that A is a semi-algebraic set in IR ` and ~u 2 A. Then there exists a continuous, semi-algebraic function f : [0; 1] ! IR ` such that f (0) = ~u and f (t) 2 A for all t 2 (0; 1]. <p> To prove the reverse inclusion, it is simpler to consider each disjunct of the canonical form of KB separately (recall that d KB is a disjunction of conjunctions). 2 In <ref> [BCR87] </ref>, a set is taken to be semi-algebraic if it is definable by a quantifier-free formula in the language of real closed fields. However, as observed in [BCR87], since the theory of real closed fields admits elimination of quantifiers [Tar51], the two definitions are equivalent. 3 We are very grateful to <p> simpler to consider each disjunct of the canonical form of KB separately (recall that d KB is a disjunction of conjunctions). 2 In <ref> [BCR87] </ref>, a set is taken to be semi-algebraic if it is definable by a quantifier-free formula in the language of real closed fields.
