Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient multilayer general area router, named V4, for MCM and dense PCB designs. The unique feature of the V4 router is that it uses no more than four vias to route every net and yet produces high quality routing solutions. A number of combinatorial optimization techniques are used in the V4 router to produce high quality routing solutions in polynomial time. As a result, the V4 router is independent of net ordering, runs much faster, and has far less memory requirement compared to other multilayer general area routers. We tested our router on several examples, including two industrial MCM designs from MCC. Compared with the 3D maze router, on average the V4 router uses 2% less wirelength, 31% fewer vias, and runs 26 times faster. Compared with the SLICE router, on average the V4 router uses 4% less wirelength and runs 4.6 times faster.

Reference-contexts: For high-performance MCMs, vias not only increase the manufacture cost but also degrade the system performance since they form impedance discontinuities and cause reflections when the interconnections have to be modeled as transmission lines <ref> [Ba90] </ref>. 2. Problem Formulation The MCM routing problem consists of a set of modules, a set of nets, and a multilayer routing substrate. Modules (dies) are mounted on the top of the substrate by wire bonding, tape-automated bonding (TAB), or flip-chip bonding with solder bump connections.

Reference-contexts: Nets are first assigned to x-y layer pairs and then two-layer routing is carried out for each x-y layer pair (the x-layer runs horizontal wires and the y-layer runs vertical wires) <ref> [HoSV90] </ref>. Although this approach is efficient in general, it faces a few problems. First we have to predetermine the number of the routing layers before we can carry out layer assignment, but there is no accurate estimation for the number of routing layers required.

Reference-contexts: Moreover, detailed routing information, such as constraints on via and segment locations, are not considered during the layer assignment stage, which may lead to poor detailed routing results. Recently, a multilayer MCM router named SLICE was developed by Khoo and Cong <ref> [KhCo92] </ref>. It computes a routing solution on a layer-by-layer basis and carries out planar routing in each layer. On average it uses 31% fewer vias and runs four times faster than the 3D maze router. <p> Based on these results and the efficient solution to the generalized maximum weighted non-crossing matching problem by Khoo and Cong in <ref> [KhCo92] </ref>, we have concluded that the horizontal track assignment of the left terminals in column c can be carried out optimally in O (h c logh c ) time. 3.3. <p> Currently, we are working on such an enhancement. Table 4 shows the comparison of the V4 router with a general 3D maze router and the SLICE router for multilayer MCM designs <ref> [KhCo92] </ref>. The 3D maze router failed to produce a routing solution for mcc2 due to its high memory requirement for large examples. Compared with the 3D maze router, on average the V4 router used 2% less wirelength, 31% fewer vias, and ran 26 times faster.

Reference-contexts: A k-terminal net can be decomposed into k - 1 two-terminal nets so that it can be routed using at most 4 (k - 1) vias by the V4 router. makes an interesting contrast with the theoretical result by Marek-Sadowska <ref> [Ma84] </ref> which shows that each two-terminal net can be routed using at most one via in a two-layer topological routing solution. Although the result in [Ma84] is very interesting in theory, the resulting topological routing solution usually uses long wires and introduces congestion when mapped to a physical routing solution. <p> can be routed using at most 4 (k - 1) vias by the V4 router. makes an interesting contrast with the theoretical result by Marek-Sadowska <ref> [Ma84] </ref> which shows that each two-terminal net can be routed using at most one via in a two-layer topological routing solution.

To our knowledge, the V4 router is the first practical multilayer general area router which guarantees to use a small number of vias for every net yet produces high quality physical routing solutions.
