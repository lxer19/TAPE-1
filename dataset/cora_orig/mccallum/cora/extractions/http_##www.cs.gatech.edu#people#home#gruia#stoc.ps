Title: An Improved Approximation Algorithm for Multiway Cut  
Author: Gruia Calinescu Howard Karloff Yuval Rabani 
Keyword: k  
Note: 3  
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new linear programming relaxation for Multiway Cut and a new approximation algorithm based on it. The algorithm breaks the threshold of 2 for approximating Multiway Cut, achieving a performance ratio of at most 1:5 1 k . This improves the previous result for every value of k. In particular, for k = 3 we get a ratio of 7

Reference-contexts: Therefore, unless P=NP, there is no polynomial-time approximation scheme for Multiway Cut [3]. For k = 2, the problem is identical to the undirected version of the extensively studied s-t min-cut problem of Ford and Fulkerson [11], and thus has polynomial-time algorithms (see, e.g., <ref> [21, 1] </ref>). Prior to this paper, the best (and essentially the only) approximation algorithm for k 3 was due to the above-mentioned paper of Dahlhaus et al. They give a very simple combinatorial isolation heuristic that achieves an approximation ratio of 2 1 1 .
