Abstract: The very-High-Speed Backbone Network Service (vBNS) is a high-performance network service sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) through a cooperative agreement with MCI Telecommunications. This service, which is implemented by means of a nationwide OC-12 IP-over-ATM backbone, provides highspeed data connectivity among research and education institutions and gives remote users access to supercomputer centers. In this paper, we report on performance measurement and analysis that we perform routinely on the vBNS. We run TCP and UDP-based throughput benchmarking tools on ATM-attached hosts to demonstrate the performance of the vBNS backbone. We compare the performance achieved over pure ATM-switched paths to that of routed paths. We use a TCP benchmarking tool to show the importance of proper buffersize tuning in a high bandwidth-delay product environment, including a cross-country connection between OC-12 connected hosts.

Reference-contexts: selected OC-3 rate paths. 5.1 mping Tests In this section, we provide a brief description of the mping tool, explain how we use mping on the vBNS, and present a set of representative mping results. 5.1.1 What is mping? mping is a network benchmarking tool developed at Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center <ref> [Mathis94] </ref>. It is a Unix application program that executes on the testing host and operates by sending either UDP or ICMP datagrams and receiving ICMP replies. mping is flexible and can operate in a number of modes.
