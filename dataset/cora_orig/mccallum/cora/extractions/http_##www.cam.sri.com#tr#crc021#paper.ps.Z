Abstract: The paper describes work on applying a general purpose natural language processing system to transfer-based interactive translation. Transfer takes place at the level of Quasi Logical Form (QLF), a contextually sensitive logical form representation which is deep enough for dealing with cross-linguistic differences. Theoretical arguments and experimental results are presented to support the claim that this framework has good properties in terms of modularity, compositionality, re-versibility and monotonicity.

Reference-contexts: Since vocabulary has primarily been selected with regard to utility (we have, for example, made considerable use of frequency dictionaries <ref> (Allen 1970) </ref>), we think it reasonable to claim that QLF-based transfer is simplifying the construction of transfer rules in a substantial proportion of the commonly encountered cases.

Reference-contexts: The LF language is based on first order predicate logic extended with generalized quantifiers and some other higher order constructs <ref> (Alshawi and van Eijck, 1989) </ref>. For example, in a context where she can refer to Mary Smith, and one to "a car", a possible LF for She hired one is: quant (exists,C,[car1,C], quant (exists,E,[event,E], [past,[hire1,E,mary_smith,C]])).

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION In this paper we describe a translation project whose aim is to build an experimental Bilingual Conversation Interpreter (BCI) which will allow communication through typed text between two monolingual humans using different languages <ref> (cf Miike et al, 1988) </ref>. The choice of languages for the prototype system is English and Swedish.

Reference-contexts: The QLF is thus the level of representation encoding the results of compositional linguistic analysis independently of contextually sensitive aspects of understanding. These aspects are addressed by the contextual interpretation phase which has the following subphases: quantifier scoping <ref> (Moran 1988) </ref>, reference resolution (Alshawi 1990), and plausibility judgement. The QLF language is a superset of the LF language containing additional expressions corresponding, for example, to unresolved anaphors.

Reference-contexts: Since the rules used during the analysis phase are declarative and bidirectional, these are also used for generation. To achieve computationally efficient analysis and generation, the rules are pre-compiled in different ways for application in the two directions. Generation uses the semantic-head driven algorithm <ref> (Shieber et al, 1990) </ref>. 2.2 The QLF Language The QLF representations produced for a sentence are neutral with respect to the choice of referents for pronouns and definite descriptions, and relations implied by compound nouns and ellipsis.
