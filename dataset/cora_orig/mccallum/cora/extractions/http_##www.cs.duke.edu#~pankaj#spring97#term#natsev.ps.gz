Title: Multiresolution Wavelet Representations for Arbitrary Meshes

Affiliation: Department of Computer Science Duke University  
Abstract: Wavelets and multiresolution analysis are instrumental for developing efficient methods for representing, storing and manipulating functions at various levels of detail. Although alternative methods such as hierarchical quadtrees or pyramidal models have been used to that effect as well, wavelets have picked up increasing popularity in recent years due to their energy compactness, efficiency, and speed. Wavelet representations have achieved a great success in a wide variety of applications, including graphics, data compression, signal processing, physical simulation, hierarchical optimization, and numerical analysis, among others. This paper gives an overview of wavelets and their construction, as well as some applications to graphics and 3-D mesh processing at multiple levels of detail. The emphasis is on meshes of arbitrary topology and their multiresolution analysis by means of subdivision wavelets and their generalizations. In particular, both the traditional (first generation) wavelets and the more recent second generation wavelets are considered, together with the lifting scheme for their construction. Examples of such wavelets and their use for representation of arbitrary meshes are given, along with a survey of applications of wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to graphics problems.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wavelets have enjoyed a considerable attention in the past few years among the computer graphics community because of their success in solving various problems, such as global illumination and radiosity computation <ref> [GSCH93, CSSD96] </ref>, volume 1 rendering [Mur92], curve and surface modeling [GC95], animation [LGC94], and mor-phing [HWK94]. In addition, wavelets have proved themselves useful for image processing [Mal89b], image enhancement, noise removal, and feature detection [Mal92].

Reference-contexts: Two-dimensional wavelets are central to a variety of problems, such as image compression, and are typically constructed as tensor products of one-dimensional wavelets <ref> [Dau92] </ref>. Unfortunately, the tensor-product formulation requires the target functions to be defined on R 2 or a periodic version of it, such as the cylinder or torus. <p> Unfortunately, the tensor-product formulation requires the target functions to be defined on R 2 or a periodic version of it, such as the cylinder or torus. Some alternative constructions <ref> [Dau92, JM91] </ref> of wavelets on R 2 do not use tensor products but are still not applicable to functions defined on general surfaces (e.g., the sphere). <p> the coefficient is set to zero; 3. analysis and synthesis filter banks have time complexity that is linear in the number of data points. 2.1 Definition and basic properties The basic theory of wavelets and wavelet transforms was developed in the eighties by Yves Meyer, Ingrid Daubechies, and Stephane Mallat <ref> [Mey90, Dau92, Mal89a] </ref>. A vague definition of wavelets, borrowed from [Swe95], states: "Wavelets are building blocks that can quickly decorrelate data." The emphasized words point out three of the main characteristics of wavelets: mathematical basis, data decorrelation, and speed of implementation.

Reference-contexts: By manipulating the threshold (also called quantization parameter), one can achieve multiresolution representations and varying level of detail. This scheme was used in <ref> [DJL92] </ref>, where the authors report excellent lossy compression rates. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the necessary background, including the first and the second generation wavelets, as well as the so called lifting scheme for constructing them. <p> A survey of these, based mainly on [Lou94], include, but is not necessarily limited to, the following: Compression.

Reference-contexts: In the case of second generation wavelets, though, the Forier transform can no longer be used as a construction tool. An alternative construction method, called the lifting scheme was introduced by Sweldens [Swe, Swe95]. The method was inspired by the work of Donoho <ref> [Don92] </ref> and Lounsbery et al.

Reference-contexts: Wavelets defined on arbitrary meshes were pioneered by Lounsbery et al. [LDW94, Lou94], and were extended to represent functions defined on arbitrary surfaces (rather than representing the surfaces themselves) by Sweldens et al. <ref> [Swe, DS96, SS95b, SS95a] </ref>. <p> This illustrates one of the nice properties of the lift scheme|no complicated Forier analysis is needed in order to obtain the inverse of the transform. In <ref> [DS96] </ref> Daubechies and Sweldens show that every wavelet or subband transform with finite filters can be obtained with a finite number of lifting steps. By manipulating the three steps in the scheme|splitting (or subdivision), prediction, and update|one can use the lifting scheme to construct both first and second generation wavelets. <p> The tools for constructing such multires-olution representations are based on wavelets that are defined over meshes of arbitrary topological type, and were pioneered by Lounsbery et al. [LDW94, Lou94] through his subdivision wavelets, later generalized to second generation wavelets by Sweldens and others <ref> [Swe, Swe95, DS96, SS95b, SS95a] </ref>, who also provided the lifting scheme for their construction. Both methods, though, have a prerequisite that the input mesh have subdivision connectivity, or in other words, that the mesh can be obtained from a simple base mesh by recursive subdivision (typically, 4-to-1 triangle splitting).

Reference-contexts: The complex meshes obtained from automatic laser range scanning and digitizing, for example, certainly do not have the subdivision connectivity property, which is a serious limitation. Recently Eck et al. <ref> [EDD + 95] </ref> addressed this problem by use of harmonic mapping techniques that interpolate input meshes to genus-equivalent triangular meshes that possess the desired property. <p> The method is guaranteed to produce a mesh that differs from the original by no more than a specified remeshing tolerance. Combined with either Lounsbery's or Sweldens' method, the remeshing procedure of Eck et al. <ref> [EDD + 95] </ref> serves as a preprocessing step and forms a complete multiresolution analysis system for meshes of arbitrary topology.

Reference-contexts: Multiresolution editing. Hierarchical B-splines, as introduced by Forsey and Bartels <ref> [FB88] </ref>, provide a powerful mechanism for editing shapes at various levels of detail but can be applied to a restricted class of surface topologies. In contrast, the wavelet-based multiresolution analysis provides an alternative capable of handling meshes of arbitrary topological type.

Reference-contexts: The resulting technique runs in O (n log n) time, and produces results that are comparable to the standard O (n 2 log n) global optimization algorithm of Fuchs et al. <ref> [FKU77] </ref>. A similar speedup of one-dimensional optimiza 11 tions using wavelet-based multigrid techniques is reported by Gortler et al. [GSCH93]. The subdivision wavelets of Lounsbery et al. [LDW94, Lou94] can also be used to accelerate optimization over surfaces of arbitrary topology. Volume morphing.

Reference-contexts: In that respect, multiresolution analysis offers solutions to several problems in that area. Level of detail has been used in flight simulators for many years [NN84]. Funkhouser and Sequin <ref> [FS93] </ref> use it for real-time walkthroughs through architectural models. They use simplified models for distant objects and detailed models for close-up views. Their approach, however, does not generate the various levels from a single representation, and does not address the issue of varying the level of detail smoothly.

As a separate application, subdivision wavelets can be used to cluster groups of polygons into an appropriate approximation, as an alternative to the method of Smiths et al. [SAG94].

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Wavelets have enjoyed a considerable attention in the past few years among the computer graphics community because of their success in solving various problems, such as global illumination and radiosity computation [GSCH93, CSSD96], volume 1 rendering [Mur92], curve and surface modeling [GC95], animation [LGC94], and mor-phing <ref> [HWK94] </ref>. In addition, wavelets have proved themselves useful for image processing [Mal89b], image enhancement, noise removal, and feature detection [Mal92]. For an excellent survey of wavelet applications in computer graphics, see [SDS96]. In computer graphics and geometric modeling, objects are typically represented by triangular meshes of various shapes. <p> The same approach can be used in conjunction with multiresolution (rather than Forier) analysis in order to obtain similar wavelet-based morphing technique. In <ref> [HWK94] </ref> wavelets are used to decompose the volumetric datasets into a set of frequency band, followed by a smooth interpolation in each band and reconstruction to form the morphed model.

For comparison, non-wavelet polyhedral compression methods are surveyed by Heckbert and Garland [HG94], and also by Lounsbery <ref> [Lou94] </ref>, with the most notable solutions to the problem being the following: * Turk [Tur91, Tur92] develops an algorithm that places a user-specified number of vertices over the original polyhedral surface, and then uses repelling forces to spread them out. <p> They use simplified models for distant objects and detailed models for close-up views. Their approach, however, does not generate the various levels from a single representation, and does not address the issue of varying the level of detail smoothly. Lounsbery <ref> [Lou94] </ref> shows how multiresolution analysis can be used for animation previewing by providing low-cost rough model approximations, as well as for level-of-detail control. <p> A similar speedup of one-dimensional optimiza 11 tions using wavelet-based multigrid techniques is reported by Gortler et al.

For an excellent survey of wavelet applications in computer graphics, see <ref> [SDS96] </ref>. In computer graphics and geometric modeling, objects are typically represented by triangular meshes of various shapes. Applications like special effects and animation often warrant the design and editing of complex geometric models of arbitrary topology.

Reference-contexts: A vague definition of wavelets, borrowed from <ref> [Swe95] </ref>, states: "Wavelets are building blocks that can quickly decorrelate data."

Reference-contexts: The paper also presents an additional method for blending between levels of detail. However, is does not adapt well to curvature changes and tends to blur finer detail. * Schroeder et al. <ref> [SZL92] </ref> provide an iterative mechanism, which they call decimation, for reducing mesh complexity by repeatedly passing over the mesh looking for areas that can be simplified.

Reference-contexts: Their techniques were further modified for surfaces of arbitrary topological type by Hoppe et al. [Hop94, HDH + 94] and adapted for editing polyhedra, smooth subdivision surfaces, surfaces with boundaries, and smooth subdivision surfaces with corners and "darts." Zorin, Schroder and Sweldens <ref> [ZSS97] </ref> describe another approach for multiresolution mesh editing. They develop a scalable interactive multiresolution editing system for meshes of arbitrary topology that allows for both global (e.g., shape) changes as well as local modifications preserving the overall topological structure.
