Abstract: A growing set of applications require digital audio and video data, commonly referred to as continuous media (CM). These applications require continuous real-time data flow during playback and recording. Scheduling strategies to service accesses by multiple concurrent applications at CM data servers (CMS) must provide timely access to storage devices. Besides real-time access, such data is characterized by its large size and high transmission bandwidth and must be compressed to elimiate temporal and spatial redundancy. However, by compressing data, data rate variability is introduced which creates problems to the scheduling strategy like low resource and bandwidth utilization. In this paper we present a scheduling strategy at the CMS for compressed streams called QBSCAN which exploits clients' concessions in playback quality to achieve higher utilization of the CMS. By stating the needed Quality of Service (QoS), clients declare their level of acceptance of tardiness and smoothness during playback. QBSCAN uses clients' QoS specifications to allocate I/O bandwidth and consequently increases the resource utilization. Simultaneously, the total capacity (the number of concurrent streams supported) of the CMS is enhanced. The efficacy of QBSCAN is demonstrated via simulation studies.

Reference-contexts: The proof for this claim in given in <ref> [10] </ref>. The upper bound in Lemma 1 is weak, since the claim makes no assumption about the distribution of frame size (u i ). When information about the distribution is available tighter bounds can be derived ([10]). <p> Thus, E (D i j D i &gt; 0) = E (S k i i &gt; k i (u i )) k i (u i ) <ref> [10] </ref> shows how to compute E (D i j D i &gt; 0) when the p.d.f. of u i can be approximated. 4.3 The QBSCAN Algorithm We now propose the QBSCAN algorithm, a QoS based enhancement of BSCAN. Figure 6 sum marizes the design. <p> This is to prevent any cross-corelation effects that can creep into simulations 13 that pick random numbers from a single generator. MAGELLAN achieves this by seeding, and storing the states of multiple random number generators separately. The rules for data summarization and seeding are described in <ref> [10] </ref>. 5.3 Experiments We report results from the following experiments: * Experiment 1 Effect of reserving sub-worst case bandwidth: The aim of this experiment was to validate the claims that were made in Section 4.2. <p> As expected both P i and E (D i j D i &gt; 0) are inversely proportional to (u i ) under both load conditions. This was predicted by Lemma 1 and followed the analytical estimates derived in <ref> [10] </ref> for U (5:23; 13:71). The plot of MTBR in Figure 9 shows that MTBR is directly proportional to (u i ). This was the relationship predicted by Equation 3. <p> To compute the predicted values, QBSCAN computed the stream starvation probabilities and data shortages from analytical expressions derived in <ref> [10] </ref>. Thus, QBSCAN does maintain the QoS requirements of the client for different frame size statistic used. To prove that QBSCAN improves utilization decreases, the storage system utilization shows improvement.

Reference-contexts: In Section 5 we report results from simulation studies that supports the key claim that QBSCAN, by using clients' QoS requirements, increases utilization as well as capacity of the CMS. 2 Scheduling Strategy at CMS 2.1 The BSCAN Algorithm In <ref> [11] </ref> we described a scheduling approach called the BSCAN (Batched-SCAN) algorithm to service concurrent access by clients to the storage system at the CMS. BSCAN uses the SCAN [19] algorithm to service different streams and batches accesses to data of a single stream. <p> Thus, in the computed schedule it is neccessary to ensure that the entire frame is available in buffer at the time of decompression/rendition. The solution to the problem of computing feasible BSCAN schedules that satisfy these two constraints while guaranteeing smooth playback is discussed in <ref> [11] </ref>. We supply an outline of the solution here. <p> The proof for this claim is given in <ref> [11] </ref>. We sketch its outline here. The solution for Problem P is greater than (or equal to) dn fl e. P U STAR commences its search of the feasible subspace from this point in R s . Due to the additional constraints it examines only integer solutions for n.

More specifically, compression schemes for video streams like <ref> [14] </ref> and [22] introduce data rate variability because they 5 exploit temporal and spatial redundancy. Techniques like JPEG [22] involve intra-frame compression, i.e. individual frames are compressed independently while techniques like MPEG [14] involve inter-frame compression, i.e. redundancy across successive frames is removed. <p> More specifically, compression schemes for video streams like <ref> [14] </ref> and [22] introduce data rate variability because they 5 exploit temporal and spatial redundancy.

Thus, the source of data rate variability is differing sizes of the compressed frames generated.
