Abstract: A simple circuit is described that functions as an analog memory whose state and dynamics are directly controlled by pulsatile inputs. The circuit has been incorporated into a silicon neuron with a spatially extensive dendritic tree as a means of controlling the spike firing threshold of an integrate-and-fire soma. Spiking activity generated by the neuron itself and by other units in a network can thereby regulate the neuron's excitability over time periods ranging from milliseconds to many minutes. Experimental results are presented showing applications to temporal edge sharpening, bi-stable behavior, and a network that learns in the manner of classical conditioning.

Reference-contexts: To this end, we developed a simple four-transistor analog memory circuit which we call a ux capacitor. Flux Capacitor The ux capacitor is based on techniques used with CAPS-and-DAC analog memory and switched-capacitors <ref> (e.g., Allen and Sanchez-Sinencio, 1984) </ref>. It uses a conventional MOS capacitor to hold charge, but its state is set via two opposing local synapses: an upper that increases the capacitor voltage and a lower that decreases it. A diagram of the circuit is shown in Figure 2a.

Reference-contexts: The capacitor is also the gate of a MOSFET, and therefore, directly affects the transistors operation. The state of the capacitor can be set using Fowler-Nordheim tunneling (Lenzlinger and Snow, 1969), or, in some implementations, with both tunneling and hot electron injection <ref> (Diori et al., 1995) </ref>. Both methods require elevated voltages and a relatively long time to set the desired state compared to CAPS-and-DAC memory. In general, the charging rate of the capacitor (oating gate) is not well known. <p> In general, the charging rate of the capacitor (oating gate) is not well known. Therefore, the accuracy and precision to which the memory can be set is limited unless a feedback technique is used <ref> (e.g., Diori et al., 1995) </ref>. Floating gate memory devices were proposed for use in artificial neural networks by Alspector et al., (1987) and were integrated as a large array of over 10,000 memory elements by Holler et al., (1989).

Reference-contexts: Experiments were performed using multiple neuromorphs having 4- and 8-branched dendritic trees. The dendrite dynamics was set to give membrane time constants in the range of 10 msecs. The neuromorphs were embedded in the "virtual wire system" previously described <ref> (Elias, 1993) </ref>. This system allows spikes generated by thousands of neuromorphs to be distributed with programmable delays to arbitrary synapses throughout a network. A host computer generated the spatiotemporal patterns of spikes used as test stimuli for the network. It also recorded the FIGURE 4. <p> It also recorded the FIGURE 4. State trajectories measured from a flux capacitor using an on-chip source follower. The temporal patterns of synaptic activation that produced the trajectories were delivered to flux capacitor synapses by a network connection circuit called virtual wires <ref> (Elias, 1993) </ref>. a) sine. b) damped sine. c) sum of three sine waves. The same or arbitrary trajectories can be generated over widely different time intervals. <p> We envision that large numbers of ux capacitors, being compact, could be distributed throughout networks as short to intermediate term storage to control synaptic weights and other neuromorph parameters. The "Virtual wire" interconnection system <ref> (Elias, 1993) </ref> that made the tiny classical conditioning network possible, is designed to route spikes generated by thousands of sources, including neuromorphs and external sensors, to even larger numbers of synaptic destinations, many of which will be ux capacitor storage elements.

Reference-contexts: store synaptic weights (e.g., Shoemaker et al., 1988; Holler et al., 1989; Lee et al., 1991; Murray and Tarassenko, 1994; Hasler et al., 1995), to provide offset correction in silicon retinas (Mead, 1989), to represent calcium concentration in silicon neurons (Mahowald and Douglas, 1991), to hold state in artificial dendrites <ref> (Elias and Northmore, 1995) </ref>, and to set conductance parameters for voltage-sensitive channels (Douglas and Mahowald, 1995). Other applications of analog memory include setting the threshold and integration time constant in integrate-and-fire somata and the setting of dynamics and conductance parameters in silicon dendrites. <p> In the next section, we present several experiments that show interesting adaptation responses to specific network activity when the ux capacitor state is used as the spike firing threshold for silicon neurons. 10 Network Dependent Spike Threshold Hardware System Network dependency experiments were conducted using our silicon neuron or neuromorph <ref> (Elias and Northmore, 1995) </ref> having an integrated ux capacitor as a means of setting the spike firing threshold of its integrate-and-fire "soma" (Fig. 5).

Reference-contexts: This could potentially be done using a dedicated processor, but it would add considerably to system complexity. As a long-term adaptive memory element, devices based on oating gates are unequaled <ref> (e.g., Hasler et al. 1995) </ref>, but they require high voltages for programming and their dynamics depend significantly on these voltage levels. By dynamics, we mean the rate of change in the memory state. <p> Such state changes could play an important role in modifying and regulating behavior. In artificial nervous systems, network-dependent, short-term memories may be essential for similar purposes. Although oating gate devices have been proposed as the basis for an adaptive memory <ref> (e.g., Hasler et al., 1995) </ref> we believe that the ux capacitor offers more advantages for use in short-term, network-dependent memory applications.

McKenna, </editor> <publisher> J. </publisher>
Reference-contexts: This property allows the threshold to settle at various levels depending upon which spike source dominates the threshold-setting mechanism at any given time. The resulting bistable behavior is reminiscent of the two or more modes exhibited by neurons at various sites in the CNS, most notably the thalamus <ref> (McCormick, Huguenard, and Strowbridge, 1992) </ref> where input spikes are processed differently, according to the threshold state. In the neuromorphic circuit illustrated in Fig. 7, processing is approximately linear for small signals in the low threshold state, and non-linear in the high threshold state.

Reference-contexts: The voltage step depends on the current state, the supply potential, the synapse weight, and the charge injection factor. Henceforth, references to ux capacitor synaptic weights will include the contribution due to charge injection. As with real synapses <ref> (e.g., Shepherd and Koch, 1990) </ref> the change in membrane state due to synaptic activation is dependent on the instantaneous voltage of the local membrane and the synaptic conductance (weight).
