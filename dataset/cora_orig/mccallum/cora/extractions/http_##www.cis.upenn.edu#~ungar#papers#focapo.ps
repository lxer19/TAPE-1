Abstract: Model predictive control strategies generally focus on controlling plant outputs to setpoints; in industry, however, a more desirable goal is maximizing a plants profitability. In principle, this can be done by creating a plant model and maximizing profit with respect to the market prices of the plants inputs and outputs, but in practice, such centralized approaches often cannot effectively be applied at the operations time scale due to the size and complexity of the problem. One solution is to use decentralized optimization at the unit operations level by tearing process streams and coordinating the resulting pieces. Such optimization, however, requires that unit inputs and outputs be priced. We show that a traditional Lagrangean-based approach to this pricing fails for simple systems. Instead, we define slack resources over the torn process streams and price them using auctions. Unlike Lagrange multipliers, slack resource prices contain useful information and can be used to make decisions regarding capital improvements, thus providing a strong tie between the operations and management layers in chemical plants.

Reference-contexts: is a well-known market-based interpretation of the primal and dual problems in optimization: given a primal problem, the dual problem can be viewed as a malevolent market whose goal is to drive the net profit of the primal problem to as low a value as possible by manipulating resource prices <ref> (Bradley, 1977) </ref>. This malevolent market is assumed to be completecomposed of an infinite number of infinitely varied agents. Now consider the case where we have a plant which is decomposed into separate units. Although the slack resources are the same, this market consists only of the component subproblems.

Reference-contexts: The idea is this: augment the amount normally charged each unit, p|T -T |, with a small quadratic term, q (T A B ) 2 , where q is some small positive constant. The existence of an optimal resource price vector can be demonstrated <ref> (see Jose, 1997) </ref> by casting this augmented slack resource auction as a nonlinear complementarity problem: ( ) Find such that:p p q - D ; 0 , (9) where D (p;q) is the excess demand vector and p is the slack price vector.
