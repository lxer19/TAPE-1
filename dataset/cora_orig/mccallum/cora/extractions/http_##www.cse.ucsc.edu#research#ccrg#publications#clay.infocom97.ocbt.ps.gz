Title: The Ordered Core Based Tree Protocol

Abstract: This paper presents a new protocol, the Ordered Core Based Tree (OCBT) protocol, which remedies several shortcomings of the Core Based Tree (CBT) multicast protocol. We show that the CBT protocol can form loops during periods of routing instability, and that it can consistently fail to build a connected multicast tree, even when the underlying routing is stable. The OCBT protocol provably eliminates these deficiencies and reduces the latency of tree repair following a link or core failure. OCBT also improves scalability by allowing flexible placement of the cores that serve as points of connection to a multicast tree. Simulation results show that the amount of control traffic in OCBT is comparable to that in CBT.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Multicast routing protocols build routing trees for the dissemination of messages to a select group of other stations. In some protocols, such as the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP) <ref> [1] </ref> and the Protocol Independent Multicast-Dense Mode (PIM-DM) protocol [2] the receiving group is assumed to be fairly dense and the sender initiates the multicast assuming all routers in the network are interested in receiving the multicast.

For each run of the simulation, we chose a particular set of cores using what is probably the same trivial heuristic used by Bal-lardie <ref> [3] </ref>, that is, looking at a picture of the network we picked distributed nodes of relatively high degree to serve as cores. For OCBT, the cores were divided into two logical levels.

Reference-contexts: Section 3 describes and specifies the OCBT protocol. Section 4 provides an example of how OCBT handles link failures and is followed in Section 5 with simulation results showing the performance of OCBT and CBT, based on the CBT specifications of April 1996 <ref> [6] </ref>. We discuss some aspects of core placement in Section 6 before presenting our conclusions. 2 Looping in CBT CBT [3] [7] [8] [6] forms a backbone within a connected group of nodes called cores. <p> handles link failures and is followed in Section 5 with simulation results showing the performance of OCBT and CBT, based on the CBT specifications of April 1996 <ref> [6] </ref>. We discuss some aspects of core placement in Section 6 before presenting our conclusions. 2 Looping in CBT CBT [3] [7] [8] [6] forms a backbone within a connected group of nodes called cores. The backbone is formed by selecting one router, called the primary core, to serve as a connection point for the other cores, called secondary cores. <p> According to the CBT protocol specification of April 1996 <ref> [6] </ref>, the rejoining router simply sends a quit request to its parent to remove the loop. This correction mechanism can fail, however, as the rejoining router takes no action to destroy its sub-tree and instead attempts to rejoin again, possibly along the same path forming the same loop. <p> This results in less traffic following a link failure than in CBT, in which flush messages from near a core or rejoin messages originating far from the core have to travel relatively long distances. More recent specifications for CBT <ref> [6] </ref> have a single primary core that forms a point of connection for secondary cores that stay off-tree until required to join. This single primary core is a limiting factor to the scalability of CBT, as it must receive and respond to all passive join-requests from the entire multicast tree. <p> As each set of simulation runs included 138 runs of the CBT protocol, and an average of 15.6 disconnected sub-trees were formed during those runs, we found a disconnection rate of 11.3% under the current protocol specifications <ref> [6] </ref>. Clearly, a routing protocol that is unable to find a correct path when one exists one time out of nine is hardly suitable for use in a large Internet.

Reference-contexts: We discuss some aspects of core placement in Section 6 before presenting our conclusions. 2 Looping in CBT CBT [3] <ref> [7] </ref> [8] [6] forms a backbone within a connected group of nodes called cores. The backbone is formed by selecting one router, called the primary core, to serve as a connection point for the other cores, called secondary cores. <p> Another partial solution to congestion over fixed links is to allow children to quit from their parents and connect on a shorter path to the core if one becomes available. This in fact was first suggested by Ballardie for CBT <ref> [7] </ref>, but has not yet been included in our simulation. Another improvement to be investigated will be to make each source a local core so that near by nodes can join directly to it, reducing the delay to those nodes.

Reference-contexts: OCBT has been shown to be free of loops at every instant and to be safe and live <ref> [9] </ref>. OCBT also reduces control traffic following a link failure, allows for flexible core placement, and does this without increasing the complexity of the protocol. When a router has a member wishing to receive the multicast session, it locates the nearest core and sends a join-request towards that core. <p> The distribution of cores reduces the amount of repair traffic by limiting the distance over which repair messages have to travel to within the logical level. OCBT eliminates the loops and disconnected sub-trees that occur in the CBT protocol <ref> [9] </ref>; our simulation results corroborate our verification work. The cost of OCBT is a slight increase in the initial number of messages required to construct the multicast tree.

Reference-contexts: Each level of cores in the scoped area could have its own local multicast address. A scheme similar to this was proposed in HPIM <ref> [10] </ref>. The issue of core information distribution is an area of future work for OCBT and other protocols based on shared trees. <p> This is true in CBT and PIM-SM as well. While determining optimal core placement remains an open problem, there have been suggestions made as to methods of migrating cores to provide better service [11] <ref> [10] </ref>. We believe that core placement can be made a matter of policy rather than optimality if the scope of the multicast is limited at each level. The flexibility of adding additional cores in OCBT supports this approach.
