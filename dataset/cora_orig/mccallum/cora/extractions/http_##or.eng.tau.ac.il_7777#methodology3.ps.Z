Abstract: Research is a design activity whose decisions involve the ways in which research is carried out and its results interpret. These activities comprise what is referred to as research methodology. This paper brings the concepts of capturing design rationale and machine learning to bear on the design of research itself. Therefore, design decisions concerning research must be recorded to allow for understanding feedback and updating of research strategies. In addition, successes as well as failures of research decisions must be reported to facilitate learning about research. This requires a shift in the way research is carried out and reported. This paper illustrates this shift in the context of a specific project on machine learning in design.

Reference-contexts: This information may be used to select a learning program for performing a specific learning task. Similar information requirements emerge from Chandrasekaran's work on generic tasks as high level building blocks for expert systems design <ref> (Chandrasekaran, 1986) </ref>. The concept of generic learning tasks is the application of the generic task idea to ML except that now the task is learning a specific type of knowledge that will be used by some generic (problem-solving) task.

In arguing for adopting S 2 , I will apply terms borrowed from two topics in design research: the capture of design rationale (CDR) and machine learning (ML), to the research activities researchers pursue.

Reference-contexts: Assumption 1 restricts the scope of artifacts discussed, thereby allowing available learning techniques to be used for the knowledge generation. All these assumptions lead to the selection of Cobweb <ref> (Fisher, 1987) </ref> as a potential tool. Since Cobweb has several limitations in the context of design (Reich and Fenves, 1991), a new system was developed, called Ecobweb, that supports the five assumptions. 1 Note that a hierarchical classification tree is not a decision tree. <p> A statistical function, called category utility, approximates knowledge quality by evaluating a classification of a set of designs into mutually-exclusive classes. When a new design is introduced, Ecobweb tries to accommodate it into the existing classification hierarchy starting at the root by performing one of five operators (see <ref> (Fisher, 1987) </ref> for a detailed description of these operators) that maximizes the value of the category utility function. <p> In involved the exploration of a probabilistic representation of learned knowledge. The Cobweb algorithm <ref> (Fisher, 1987) </ref> supported this requirement, in addition to being incremental. While the latter was viewed initially just as a good feature it later became a fundamental requirement for supporting design. Another characteristic of Cobweb that initially did not seem necessary but proved useful was its ability to perform flexible prediction.

Failures are probably the best source of progress <ref> (Petroski, 1989) </ref>. Failures will be those that are acknowledged as such after researchers tried to salvage whatever "positive" results they could for their publications. Therefore, failures reported will be close to "near misses" which are excellent triggers of learning (Winston, 1975).

Reference-contexts: Reflections. There are additional avenues for conducting evaluations beside testing the performance of the computational model. In particular, the relevance of the work to the practice of engineering, a topic that is almost never assessed in design research, including the study reported in this paper (see <ref> (Piela et al, 1992) </ref> for a good positive example), can be assessed by deploying a program in a workplace and analyzing its usability.

In this sense, science does not contain failures such as fruitless research paths pursued by scientists, albeit some argue (e.g., Popper <ref> (Popper, 1965) </ref>) that science is all about conjectures and refutations. In the second sense, denoted by S 2 , science contains as many more details as possible about scientists' activities. In effect, science is a historical description of research.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, GDT is hardly ever referenced in the literature. From first glance it was clear that GDT and Cobweb had many similarities.

Reference-contexts: Such studies must be informed by methodologies developed in the human and social sciences to be considered adequate. 3 M LTD: The road from S 1 to S 2 The third product of this research is M 2 LTD, a method for selecting ML techniques to perform learning tasks <ref> (Reich, 1994) </ref>. M 2 LTD consists of knowledge describing the issues and tradeoffs that inform the selection and a sequence of 5 steps that uses this knowledge (see Figure 3). The evaluation of M 2 LTD is presently limited.

Reference-contexts: a hierarchical classification specifies how concepts are organized in a class/sub-class structure. 2 In this paper, we are using the terms design knowledge and its quality rather loosely; elsewhere, we try to address these issues in more detail while pointing at some of the difficulties in being precise about them <ref> (Reich, 1995) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: For example, mechanisms for abstractions or analogy that were developed, were incompatible and their use required changing the representation and problem structure to fit their design. Only recently, were several high level mechanisms such as data-chunking <ref> (Rosenbloom et al, 1987) </ref> made available for sharing among different Soar projects. 4.2 The goal of learning After the initial experiments with Soar, it was time to formulate an attainable goal for the learning project.

Reference-contexts: This comparison illuminated several aspects. (1) GDT assumes that knowledge about designs is represented by mathematical topology <ref> (Sutherland, 1975) </ref>, whereas Ecobweb represents it by a classification hierarchy, a very degenerate approximation of a topology. (2) Based on the structure of design knowledge, GDT guarantees perfect convergence to design solutions, whereas Ecobweb can never be perfect and performs depending on the examples it has learned and its synthesis mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: The study of the domain, including the search and construction of bridge data was time consuming. The study started with reviewing old texts on bridge design <ref> (Waddell, 1916) </ref> and ended with recent books and publications on the subject (Fox, 1979; Podolny and Scalzi, 1986; Spector and Gifford, 1986; Troitsky, 1988). The study revealed that the process of bridge design can be roughly decomposed into three phases: conceptual, preliminary, and detailed.

Reference-contexts: Failures are probably the best source of progress (Petroski, 1989). Failures will be those that are acknowledged as such after researchers tried to salvage whatever "positive" results they could for their publications. Therefore, failures reported will be close to "near misses" which are excellent triggers of learning <ref> (Winston, 1975) </ref>. Therefore, beyond subscribing to S 2 , the documentation of failures must be legitimized as a service critical for progress. 3. Mundane aspects of research.

Reference-contexts: The investment in this path and the interesting and promising results were too encouraging to risk them for the difficult path of using Soar. 4.6 General Design Theory During that time, I accidentally came across Yoshikawa's paper on General Design Theory (GDT) <ref> (Yoshikawa, 1981) </ref>. It was an accident, because although Yoshikawa's initial work and its later extensions (Tomiyama and Yoshikawa, 1986; Tomiyama et al, 1989) are insightful, its complex mathematical foundations prevented researchers in the West from paying any attention to its assumptions and their consequences for design.
