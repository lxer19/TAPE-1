Abstract: Several new technologies collectively referred to as solid freeform fabrication have been developed in the last decade for use in the rapid prototyping of solid three dimensional parts. These include stereolithography, photosolidification, solid ground curing, 3D printing, fused deposition modeling, ballistic particle manufacturing, selective laser sintering, laminated object manufacturing, and shape deposition manufacturing. The prototypes they produce serve as physical models during design review, allow engineers to perform functional testing of parts, and are often used as mold patterns or positives for secondary tooling to manufacture small batch sizes. This paper describes the technologies used by each of these processes, and compares their strengths and limitations.

Reference-contexts: In addition, support structures must be designed to connect the part to the support platform during all phases of building and to prevent cantilevered features from sagging downwards or curling upwards. Next the CAD file must be translated into a triangulated boundary representation format (known as .STL <ref> [1] </ref>) that the SLA machine understands and transferred to the SLA's computer. The SLA software then slices the .STL files for the part and its supports, generating cross sections describing the horizontal layers.

Reference-contexts: Stereolithography, the first commercially available rapid prototyping technology, uses an ultraviolet laser to cure an acrylate liquid photopolymer <ref> [2, 3, 4, 20, 22] </ref>. Subsequently, other companies developed laser modeling, photosolidification, and solid ground curing technologies for use with photocurable resins. 2 2.1 Stereolithography 3D Systems obtained the first U.S. patent for a rapid prototyping technology for their StereoLithography Apparatus (SLA) in 1985 [27]. <p> Unfortunately, the LCD materials currently available are quickly damaged by ultraviolet light. 2.4 Solid Ground Curing Solid ground curing (SGC) was developed by Cubital Ltd., a company based in Israel that produces a machine called the Solider (Figure 3) <ref> [3, 4, 5, 18, 20, 22, 32] </ref>. <p> can also be used as patterns for silicon rubber, epoxy, or spray metal tooling, and sand casting [10]. 3 Deposition Approaches 3.1 Fused Deposition Modeling In fused deposition modeling (FDM), developed by Stratasys Inc., the part is built up in layers formed by extruding melted wax or plastic (Figure 4) <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 20, 22] </ref>. The modeling material is supplied as a thin, .05 inch diameter filament that feeds off of a spool into the FDM head. <p> the top are poor candidates for FDM because there would be no way to remove the supports from the interior. 3.2 Ballistic Particle Manufacturing Ballistic particle manufacturing (BPM) is a technology that has been under development for several years at the small South Carolina firm of Perception Systems, Inc. 13 <ref> [3, 4, 22, 29, 36] </ref>. BPM uses drop-on-demand ink-jet printing technology modified to "print" with drops of molten wax. The fifty micron drops of wax are sprayed at a speed of 10,000 per second; thirty two such jets are used to increase the build rate. <p> In 3D printing, a powdered material is distributed a layer at a time and selectively hardened and joined together by depositing drops of binder from a mechanism similar to that used for ink-jet printing. The main materials used are 14 ceramics: alumina particles and colloidal silica binder <ref> [3, 4, 20, 22, 38, 37, 32] </ref>. For each layer, a powder hopper and roller system distribute a thin layer of powder over the top of the work tray. Adapted continuous-jet printing nozzles apply binder during a raster scan of the work area, selectively hardening the part's cross section. <p> Unfortunately, since the input is triangulated .STL files, the droplets are only being placed closer to a faceted approximation of the actual curved boundary. 4.2 Selective Laser Sintering Selective laser sintering (SLS) was developed at the University of Texas, Austin, and licensed to DTM Corporation <ref> [4, 3, 11, 20, 22, 29, 32] </ref>. In SLS, layers of powdered particles are selectively "sintered" together by scanning a CO 2 laser over the surface of a powder bed (Figure 6). Powdered materials that can be used include nylon, polycarbonate, investment casting wax, and a metal composite. <p> In subtractive SFF technologies, the layer is formed by removing the material that is the negative of each cross section. 5.1 Stack First Laminated object manufacturing (LOM), developed by Helisys, is the only fully automated subtractive SFF technology commercially available <ref> [4, 3, 5, 20, 16, 22, 25, 33] </ref>. Laminated parts are produced from paper, plastic, foil, or composite sheets, all coated with a thermally activated adhesive. <p> This effect won't be nearly as pronounced with 3D printing's DSPC process | another factor to take into account when comparing tolerance figures. 31 Technology Z Resolution XY Resolution XY Tolerance Stereolithography .0025-.03"[22] .004-.015"[20, 35] SLA-190/20 .004-.01" min [2] .008-.011"[2] SLA-500/30 .004" min [2] .008-.01"[2] Photosolidification LSI-0609 .001-.05 <ref> [3, 20] </ref> .00025-.0015"[3] as supplied [28] LSI-2224 .001-.05"[3, 20] Solider 5600 .004-.006"[10] .004"[10] .1% .02"[10] Solider 4600 .006"[10] .004"[10] .1% .02"[10] 3D Printing MIT prototype .068-.175 mm [37] .125-.175 mm [37] .02 mm std dev [37] (.003-.007") (.005-.007") DSPC (Soligen) .007"[20, 39] .005"[39] .05mm [20] FDM 3D Modeler .001-.05"[3, 20] .009-.025"[4] <p> The same is true for fused deposition manufacturing.

Reference-contexts: The East Bay prototyping companies Metalcast Engineering and Plynetics perceive that the smoothness and accuracy of SLA parts is the highest in the industry <ref> [14] </ref>. Cubital's Solider solid ground curing systems produce more accurate parts than SLA, but the huge size and expense of the system have doubtless worked against its widespread acceptance.

Reference-contexts: a final firing step burns out the sacrificial material and completely fuses the ceramics layers, so that the finished piece will exhibit isotropic material properties. 6 Hybrid: CMU's Shape Deposition Manufac turing Shape deposition manufacturing (SDM) is a complex SFF technology being developed at Carnegie Mellon's Engineering Design Research Center <ref> [15, 46, 45] </ref>. SDM's main 22 innovations are software support for embedded components and multiple materials, and the use of 5-axis NC milling to shape the edges of individual layers. A robotic pallet system moves the part between stations that deposit and shape the layers.

Reference-contexts: Stereolithography, the first commercially available rapid prototyping technology, uses an ultraviolet laser to cure an acrylate liquid photopolymer <ref> [2, 3, 4, 20, 22] </ref>. Subsequently, other companies developed laser modeling, photosolidification, and solid ground curing technologies for use with photocurable resins. 2 2.1 Stereolithography 3D Systems obtained the first U.S. patent for a rapid prototyping technology for their StereoLithography Apparatus (SLA) in 1985 [27]. <p> Unfortunately, the LCD materials currently available are quickly damaged by ultraviolet light. 2.4 Solid Ground Curing Solid ground curing (SGC) was developed by Cubital Ltd., a company based in Israel that produces a machine called the Solider (Figure 3) <ref> [3, 4, 5, 18, 20, 22, 32] </ref>. <p> can also be used as patterns for silicon rubber, epoxy, or spray metal tooling, and sand casting [10]. 3 Deposition Approaches 3.1 Fused Deposition Modeling In fused deposition modeling (FDM), developed by Stratasys Inc., the part is built up in layers formed by extruding melted wax or plastic (Figure 4) <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 20, 22] </ref>. The modeling material is supplied as a thin, .05 inch diameter filament that feeds off of a spool into the FDM head. <p> In 3D printing, a powdered material is distributed a layer at a time and selectively hardened and joined together by depositing drops of binder from a mechanism similar to that used for ink-jet printing. The main materials used are 14 ceramics: alumina particles and colloidal silica binder <ref> [3, 4, 20, 22, 38, 37, 32] </ref>. For each layer, a powder hopper and roller system distribute a thin layer of powder over the top of the work tray. Adapted continuous-jet printing nozzles apply binder during a raster scan of the work area, selectively hardening the part's cross section. <p> Unfortunately, since the input is triangulated .STL files, the droplets are only being placed closer to a faceted approximation of the actual curved boundary. 4.2 Selective Laser Sintering Selective laser sintering (SLS) was developed at the University of Texas, Austin, and licensed to DTM Corporation <ref> [4, 3, 11, 20, 22, 29, 32] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The development of the fourth generation 5 build style, ACES, in 1993 further improved accuracy for many geometries <ref> [21] </ref>. The automotive industry is a major customer of SLA, using it for making prototype engine parts [32]. Chrysler successfully conducted performance testing on an SLA intake manifold prototype that was able to withstand six hours attached to an operational engine. <p> Although Paul Jacobs, director of R & D at 3D Systems, reports that the accuracy obtained with SLA in 1993 for a standard "user part," a benchmark part with a 9.5x9.5" cross section, was better than .004" for 90% of measurements <ref> [21] </ref>, this was a symmetric and mainly rectilinear part. Any manufacturing process that involves using SFF parts as positives for creating secondary tooling has the multiple pattern transfers and associated loss of resolution found with traditional investment casting.

Reference-contexts: Stereolithography, the first commercially available rapid prototyping technology, uses an ultraviolet laser to cure an acrylate liquid photopolymer <ref> [2, 3, 4, 20, 22] </ref>. Subsequently, other companies developed laser modeling, photosolidification, and solid ground curing technologies for use with photocurable resins. 2 2.1 Stereolithography 3D Systems obtained the first U.S. patent for a rapid prototyping technology for their StereoLithography Apparatus (SLA) in 1985 [27]. <p> shrinkage occur before the new layer is attached to the old layer, and to only tack the layers together at a few points so that there is more give, while at the same time hardening a large percentage of the polymer to minimize later shrinkage and warpage in the oven <ref> [22] </ref>. The development of the fourth generation 5 build style, ACES, in 1993 further improved accuracy for many geometries [21]. The automotive industry is a major customer of SLA, using it for making prototype engine parts [32]. <p> At Chrysler, SLA patterns have replaced patterns made of wood for vacuum form tooling and gray iron foundry casting. One 6 such casting tool was accurate enough to be used for production parts. Chrysler has also incorporated SLA patterns into squeeze molding, silicone molding, and resin transfer molding <ref> [22] </ref>. Different secondary tooling processes are appropriate when different materials, batch sizes, and accuracies are required, and SLA parts have proved adaptable to many such processes. Technology similar to that developed by 3D Systems is used in a number of stereolithography systems available abroad [22, 26]. <p> Different secondary tooling processes are appropriate when different materials, batch sizes, and accuracies are required, and SLA parts have proved adaptable to many such processes. Technology similar to that developed by 3D Systems is used in a number of stereolithography systems available abroad <ref> [22, 26] </ref>. The SOMOS machine was developed by Du Pont and licensed to Teijin Seiki. The Sony Solid Creation System (SCS) line includes a model with one of the largest build areas available for any SFF technology, 40x32x20". <p> Unfortunately, the LCD materials currently available are quickly damaged by ultraviolet light. 2.4 Solid Ground Curing Solid ground curing (SGC) was developed by Cubital Ltd., a company based in Israel that produces a machine called the Solider (Figure 3) <ref> [3, 4, 5, 18, 20, 22, 32] </ref>. <p> can also be used as patterns for silicon rubber, epoxy, or spray metal tooling, and sand casting [10]. 3 Deposition Approaches 3.1 Fused Deposition Modeling In fused deposition modeling (FDM), developed by Stratasys Inc., the part is built up in layers formed by extruding melted wax or plastic (Figure 4) <ref> [3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 20, 22] </ref>. The modeling material is supplied as a thin, .05 inch diameter filament that feeds off of a spool into the FDM head. <p> the top are poor candidates for FDM because there would be no way to remove the supports from the interior. 3.2 Ballistic Particle Manufacturing Ballistic particle manufacturing (BPM) is a technology that has been under development for several years at the small South Carolina firm of Perception Systems, Inc. 13 <ref> [3, 4, 22, 29, 36] </ref>. BPM uses drop-on-demand ink-jet printing technology modified to "print" with drops of molten wax. The fifty micron drops of wax are sprayed at a speed of 10,000 per second; thirty two such jets are used to increase the build rate. <p> In 3D printing, a powdered material is distributed a layer at a time and selectively hardened and joined together by depositing drops of binder from a mechanism similar to that used for ink-jet printing. The main materials used are 14 ceramics: alumina particles and colloidal silica binder <ref> [3, 4, 20, 22, 38, 37, 32] </ref>. For each layer, a powder hopper and roller system distribute a thin layer of powder over the top of the work tray. Adapted continuous-jet printing nozzles apply binder during a raster scan of the work area, selectively hardening the part's cross section. <p> Unfortunately, since the input is triangulated .STL files, the droplets are only being placed closer to a faceted approximation of the actual curved boundary. 4.2 Selective Laser Sintering Selective laser sintering (SLS) was developed at the University of Texas, Austin, and licensed to DTM Corporation <ref> [4, 3, 11, 20, 22, 29, 32] </ref>. In SLS, layers of powdered particles are selectively "sintered" together by scanning a CO 2 laser over the surface of a powder bed (Figure 6). Powdered materials that can be used include nylon, polycarbonate, investment casting wax, and a metal composite. <p> In subtractive SFF technologies, the layer is formed by removing the material that is the negative of each cross section. 5.1 Stack First Laminated object manufacturing (LOM), developed by Helisys, is the only fully automated subtractive SFF technology commercially available <ref> [4, 3, 5, 20, 16, 22, 25, 33] </ref>. Laminated parts are produced from paper, plastic, foil, or composite sheets, all coated with a thermally activated adhesive. <p> At a cost of $25,000 per laser for the SLA-500 or $9,200 for the SLA-250 [48], this can be a considerable expense.

Reference-contexts: Light Sculpting claims that this minimizes the number of supports required. A twelve to fifteen minute postcure is required after building is completed. There are several advantages to this layer-at-a-time approach. UV lamps are far cheaper and more reliable than the UV lasers used in stereolithography <ref> [29] </ref>. Using a deposition nozzle instead of a vat of liquid makes it easier to change polymers, even between layers [28]. Build time is thirty to forty seconds per layer regardless of complexity, but this does not include the time to plot the photomasks. <p> the top are poor candidates for FDM because there would be no way to remove the supports from the interior. 3.2 Ballistic Particle Manufacturing Ballistic particle manufacturing (BPM) is a technology that has been under development for several years at the small South Carolina firm of Perception Systems, Inc. 13 <ref> [3, 4, 22, 29, 36] </ref>. BPM uses drop-on-demand ink-jet printing technology modified to "print" with drops of molten wax. The fifty micron drops of wax are sprayed at a speed of 10,000 per second; thirty two such jets are used to increase the build rate. <p> Unfortunately, since the input is triangulated .STL files, the droplets are only being placed closer to a faceted approximation of the actual curved boundary. 4.2 Selective Laser Sintering Selective laser sintering (SLS) was developed at the University of Texas, Austin, and licensed to DTM Corporation <ref> [4, 3, 11, 20, 22, 29, 32] </ref>. In SLS, layers of powdered particles are selectively "sintered" together by scanning a CO 2 laser over the surface of a powder bed (Figure 6). Powdered materials that can be used include nylon, polycarbonate, investment casting wax, and a metal composite.

Reference-contexts: In spray metal tooling, molten metal is sprayed on the SLA positive to build up a shell that is mounted on aluminum filled epoxy to create an injection mold tool <ref> [31] </ref>. Unfortunately, the geometries that can be reproduced in this manner are somewhat limited because it is impossible to spray the sides of deep holes.

Reference-contexts: Using SFF technology typically reduces the time and cost of producing prototypes by 30 - 95% <ref> [32] </ref>. These reductions make earlier testing and multiple design iterations possible, two factors that have been shown to accelerate product development, particularly for innovative products [42]. <p> The development of the fourth generation 5 build style, ACES, in 1993 further improved accuracy for many geometries [21]. The automotive industry is a major customer of SLA, using it for making prototype engine parts <ref> [32] </ref>. Chrysler successfully conducted performance testing on an SLA intake manifold prototype that was able to withstand six hours attached to an operational engine. More commonly, however, the SLA part is used as a pattern for secondary tooling. <p> Unfortunately, the LCD materials currently available are quickly damaged by ultraviolet light. 2.4 Solid Ground Curing Solid ground curing (SGC) was developed by Cubital Ltd., a company based in Israel that produces a machine called the Solider (Figure 3) <ref> [3, 4, 5, 18, 20, 22, 32] </ref>. <p> SGC parts have been used successfully as patterns for secondary tooling. The service bureau General Pattern typically builds twenty five to thirty parts at a time with their Solider system out of an epoxy-like composite that is used to create liquid injection molds <ref> [32] </ref>. <p> In 3D printing, a powdered material is distributed a layer at a time and selectively hardened and joined together by depositing drops of binder from a mechanism similar to that used for ink-jet printing. The main materials used are 14 ceramics: alumina particles and colloidal silica binder <ref> [3, 4, 20, 22, 38, 37, 32] </ref>. For each layer, a powder hopper and roller system distribute a thin layer of powder over the top of the work tray. Adapted continuous-jet printing nozzles apply binder during a raster scan of the work area, selectively hardening the part's cross section. <p> Unfortunately, since the input is triangulated .STL files, the droplets are only being placed closer to a faceted approximation of the actual curved boundary. 4.2 Selective Laser Sintering Selective laser sintering (SLS) was developed at the University of Texas, Austin, and licensed to DTM Corporation <ref> [4, 3, 11, 20, 22, 29, 32] </ref>. In SLS, layers of powdered particles are selectively "sintered" together by scanning a CO 2 laser over the surface of a powder bed (Figure 6). Powdered materials that can be used include nylon, polycarbonate, investment casting wax, and a metal composite. <p> According to Plynetics [35, 34], SLA parts typically have tolerances of .001"/inch, .004" minimum; SLS polycarbonate parts have tolerances of .002"/inch, and SLS nylon parts, .003"/inch. Cubital reports XY tolerances of .001"/inch, though an SME video claims that SLA parts are often the most accurate <ref> [32] </ref>. The best tolerances quoted for stereolithography typically apply only to rectilinear parts [52]. For complicated part geometries, SLA tolerances are closer to .015" because warpage and shrinkage are much more difficult to predict and correct for.

Reference-contexts: In subtractive SFF technologies, the layer is formed by removing the material that is the negative of each cross section. 5.1 Stack First Laminated object manufacturing (LOM), developed by Helisys, is the only fully automated subtractive SFF technology commercially available <ref> [4, 3, 5, 20, 16, 22, 25, 33] </ref>. Laminated parts are produced from paper, plastic, foil, or composite sheets, all coated with a thermally activated adhesive.

Reference-contexts: Although many manufacturers quote absolute tolerances for their process, the accuracy is usually dependent on the size of the part and the axis of measurement.

For building flexible reinforced rubber parts, the SLA parts function as the sacrificial mandrel upon which rubber sheets are molded <ref> [43] </ref>. In spray metal tooling, molten metal is sprayed on the SLA positive to build up a shell that is mounted on aluminum filled epoxy to create an injection mold tool [31]. <p> Research aimed at developing less brittle resins has resulted in the introduction of a tougher epoxy resin for building SLA prototypes. However, for one application, building flexible reinforced rubber parts, a process has been developed that relies on the brittleness of the acrylate <ref> [43] </ref>. Flexible parts are built by applying successive layers of fabric wetted with rubber resin around an expendable tool, resulting in a part with uniform wall thickness. Traditional processes use a master tool and an intermediate tool to form the final sacrificial tool that the part is shaped upon.

Reference-contexts: SDM accepts part geometry in the ACIS [40] format, allowing curved surfaces to be expressed as NURBS. Process planning is also performed using ACIS models. Unfortunately, according to Lee Weiss, they have not found ACIS to be as robust as they had hoped <ref> [44] </ref>. 7 Comparison Rapid prototyping technologies can be compared using a variety of criteria, with cost and speed generally considered the most important.

Reference-contexts: a final firing step burns out the sacrificial material and completely fuses the ceramics layers, so that the finished piece will exhibit isotropic material properties. 6 Hybrid: CMU's Shape Deposition Manufac turing Shape deposition manufacturing (SDM) is a complex SFF technology being developed at Carnegie Mellon's Engineering Design Research Center <ref> [15, 46, 45] </ref>. SDM's main 22 innovations are software support for embedded components and multiple materials, and the use of 5-axis NC milling to shape the edges of individual layers. A robotic pallet system moves the part between stations that deposit and shape the layers.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, Ford has found that the surface finish is not smooth enough for production tooling. Several other processes also use SLA parts as the first step in tooling. In all of these processes, the SLA part needs to be hand sanded and polished first to obtain a smooth surface <ref> [47] </ref>.

Furthermore, long build times combined with the cost 26 of attended operation can make parts several times more expensive to produce with the Solider than with other systems, according to Terry Wohlers <ref> [49] </ref>. <p> FDM is also a point-to-point approach to SFF, so this build speed cannot be generalized to other geometries. Furthermore, FDM can be run with significantly thicker layers than many of the other processes, achieving better speed at the cost of lower accuracy. The Chrysler benchmarking study <ref> [49] </ref> of the time to produce a single speedometer part can be used to verify these figures (see Table 7 in Appendix A for the raw numbers).

Reference-contexts: Finer details, including thinner walls, are also possible to reproduce with polycarbonate. If the polycarbonate part is going to be used for other purposes, it can be treated with an epoxy resin to make it smoother 18 and stronger, or it can be sanded by hand <ref> [50] </ref>. Nylon parts are often durable enough to be used directly for testing snap fits and assemblies, and can withstand temperatures up to 150 ffi F.

Reference-contexts: Recyclability varies across SFF systems. With SLS, unsintered powder brushed off of the part is strained and reused. Entire FDM parts and supports can be ground up and used to create partially recycled filament <ref> [51] </ref>. In SLA systems, uncured resin in the vat can be reused. Cubital's Solider has the disadvantage that unused resin is still partially exposed, so it can't be recycled, and neither can the wax used for support. The adjustable build volume helps to reduce the total volume of waste, however.
