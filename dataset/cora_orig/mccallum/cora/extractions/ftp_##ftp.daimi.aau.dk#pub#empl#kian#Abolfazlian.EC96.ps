Abstract: In this paper we entertain a distinction between Knowledge workers as occupied workers producing and transmitting knowledge (Machlup 1962), and Information workers in a modern Knowledge Society. This distinction is built upon a discussion of the difference between the nature of knowledge and Information. Upon this the notion of Activity based Knowledge worker is introduced. Then, the notion of Intelligent Software Agents (ISAs) as autonomous, social , reactive, proactive and subservient software computer systems is introduced. In (Abolfazlian 1996a) we have shown the need for these Agents as a direct consequence of factors such as Information anxiety, i.e. a human Agents emotional response to the increasing volume and diversity of available information in our modern societies. Upon this we have shown (Abolfazlian 1996b, 1996c, 1996d) how these ISAs support human Agents in managerial issues concerning the introduction of new Information Technology in Organisations. In this paper we show how these Agents working as a bridge between Activiy-based knowledge workers and Information in Post-Cartesian organisations (Abolfazlian, 1996c) can support motivating the creation of knowledge in these organisations.

Reference-contexts: Now we are ready to look at the concept of Intelligent Software Agents. Intelligent Software Agents Intelligent Software Agents (ISAs) are essentially computer systems whose constituent parts have a special relation to one another and to the environment in which they are realised <ref> (Abolfazlian 1996a) </ref>. What makes the above mentioned relationship special is some especially developed features that these software systems have to possess in order to be identified as ISAs. <p> Although different research groups have different ideas of what exactly these features are and how they should be developed in the agents, there seems to be an agreement among almost all of these groups on which features agents, at least, must have. As we have seen in <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996a) </ref>, they have to be: Autonomous Social Reactive Proactive Subservient 18 An ISA is autonomous if it can operate without either direct human interference or any interference from other agents working in the same environment. It should also have control over its own actions, plans and internal states. <p> ISAs can actively take part in the system of knowledge and the process of knowledge creation in organisations. The Figure below portrays this. 20 TH knowledge You can find some examples of the ISAs already solving many of these problems in <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996a) </ref>. Because of their social feature, ISAs can work as mediators of the labour by operating as bridges among different competencies needed to function on different Informational Technological Tools (ITTs). Being autonomous they can interact with each other and use the knowledge distributed in their societies.

Reference-contexts: This understanding of human being based on cognitive psychology has been questioned in different traditions of psychology such as Activity Theory (e.g. Wertsch, 1979) or psychologies based on social constructivism (e.g. Berger and Luckmann, 1966). I have given some critiques of it in <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996c) </ref>. <p> This means that, that which is of greatest psychological interest is fundamentally individual and private. The true nature of the physical world, which is mechanical, is outside our reach, and is such that even if we were able to perceive it as it is, we would not recognise it <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996c) </ref>. This dualism results in a solipsistic view of human beings and thus stands in quite harmony with both the traditional epistemologys emphasis on truthfulness of knowledge and the justification requirements of Nonakas understanding of it, thus the cognitive psychology accepts the true justified belief as knowledge. <p> This 2 Central Processing Mechanism. 4 contradiction motivates us for furthering our understanding by looking upon human beings in a manner that is not bounded by the subject-object dualism and the resulted solipsism. As we saw in <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996c) </ref> the solution to this dualism is embedded in the differentiation between various Levels of explanation based on rules or causes, where mental is governed by rules, while mechanical is ordained by causes. <p> So the sufficient explanation is based on the cultural, historical and social context. By this the separation of subject and object disappears. It follows now that the subject can only be defined socially and understood in the context of social practice. The subject-object dualism is defeated <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996c) </ref>. <p> This recursive explanation or what I have called the symmetry in the defining factor <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996c) </ref> has been the source of the inspiration for those who have found the solution to this riddle in monism (either materialism or idealism). In the following, I shall present the solution developed in (Abolfazlian, 1996c), and use it to further my arguments for a new understanding of knowledge. <p> This recursive explanation or what I have called the symmetry in the defining factor <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996c) </ref> has been the source of the inspiration for those who have found the solution to this riddle in monism (either materialism or idealism). In the following, I shall present the solution developed in (Abolfazlian, 1996c), and use it to further my arguments for a new understanding of knowledge. O S 4 In order to break this symmetry we need a third party which is context. The context should not be understood as a new source of input. <p> It is also to say that a part of our understanding of the context lies in the objects that we manipulate with, and, in the same manner as before, this part cannot be reached without 4 Borrowed from <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996c) </ref>. 6 those objects. The introduction of the third part is not a matter of convenience. On the contrary, the whole concept of understanding is dependant on this third part. <p> In this way the dependency of the subject and object and what I call the third part, or context is not only demystified but also appears to be very much natural <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996c) </ref>. 5 The continuous surface should be understood as a metaphorical picture. <p> The symmetrical representation of the subject (S), the object (O) and the culture (C) must not be understood as if they enjoy the same degree of complexity. S O 6 Borrowed from <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996c) </ref>. 8 Using this diagram, we can now further our understanding of the concept of knowledge. <p> If we consider a human being (H), the task he/she is working on (T) and the information the human being uses to do the task (I), then the relationship will be as shown in the below diagram. H T In this system of activity <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996c) </ref>, the Information is nothing but the technical/psychological tool (Vygotsky, 1979) and knowledge is represented by the whole system of activity and related networks of activity 7 . <p> In order to incorporate the ideas developed in this section around the concept of knowledge, we need to look at the organisations in a related manner, thus the concept of Post-Cartesian organisation was developed in <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996c) </ref>. A Post-Cartesian organisation sees its inner subject as defined by the outer world, and its interaction with the world is mediated by the cultural and societal rules. <p> It is not surprised by the fact that for instance not only its customers needs and desires are defined by it, but also its own needs, desires and even development are defined by the very same customers <ref> (Abolfazlian, 1996c) </ref>. With this understanding of an organisation, we can now reflect upon the notion of knowledge worker in a way that is in harmony with our developed framework of knowledge and the process of knowledge creation.

Reference-contexts: In away that is what, in my opinion, confuses Blackler when he calls upon different types of knowledge, such as embodied, embedded, embrained and encultured knowledge <ref> (Blackler, 1995) </ref>. What he uses to characterise these (to him) different types of knowledge are nothing but different types of information. This is to say that the explicated subprocesses of activity representing the knowledge is not the knowledge and should not be confused by knowledge itself.

Reference-contexts: Traditional epistemology, based on the assumption of truthfulness being the necessary characteristic of knowledge, has been arguing for knowledge as justified true belief. Even though this definition has been challenged by some <ref> (e.g. Gettier, 1963) </ref>, it still remains the most believed description of knowledge. One does not reflect upon whether the above mentioned definition is a useful one, but what the argument for this definition should be built upon.

Reference-contexts: The interesting question here is if we can start the process of knowledge creation or control it, especially in an organisation, which is our point of interest here. Machlup defined knowledge workers as occupied workers producing and transmitting knowledge <ref> (Machlup, 1962) </ref>. How does his notion of knowledge worker fit within our framework developed above? We now know that Machlups understanding of human beings is based on a cognitive psychological point of view with an underlying information-processing metaphor.

Reference-contexts: Let us look at some of the writings on the nature of information. Machlup, whom we shall return to when we look at the notion of knowledge-worker , regards information as a flow of messages or meanings that restructure, add to or change knowledge <ref> (Machlup, 1983) </ref>. Dretske offers some definition of information, that goes like this: Information is that commodity capable of yielding knowledge, and what information a signal carries is what we can learn from it (Dretske 1981, p. 44).

Reference-contexts: Either 1 you accept the truthfulness criteria and follow the path of the traditional epistemology, or you base the argument on the notion of justification of knowledge, and see the knowledge as a personal belief <ref> (Nonaka, 1994) </ref>. While the former naturally emphasizes the absolute, static, and nonhuman nature of knowledge, ....., the latter sees knowledge as a dynamic human process of justifying personal belief as part of an aspiration for the truth [my italic] (Nonaka, 1994). <p> justification of knowledge, and see the knowledge as a personal belief <ref> (Nonaka, 1994) </ref>. While the former naturally emphasizes the absolute, static, and nonhuman nature of knowledge, ....., the latter sees knowledge as a dynamic human process of justifying personal belief as part of an aspiration for the truth [my italic] (Nonaka, 1994). We shall take on the challenge of questioning the notion of justified true belief as a useful definition of knowledge. This involves the concept of information which has a very central role in the neverending quest for the meaning of knowledge.

Reference-contexts: Knowledge and information are often used conjoined or interchanged, which consequently makes the understanding of the true nature of either of them most difficult. Later, we shall argue that the conjunction of knowledge and information is nothing but a category mistake <ref> (Ryle, 1949) </ref>, and get a better understanding of how the concept of knowledge relates to the concept of information. Let us look at some of the writings on the nature of information.

Reference-contexts: But the concept of rule following is quite interlaced to the social interaction with other human beings. As Peter Winch explains, someone is following a rule if he always acts in the same way on the same kind of occasion 3 <ref> (Winch, 1958, p. 28) </ref>. Here, we can understand the same kind of occasion by making a judgement, based on a criterion of meaning of the language to which the word same belongs to, that a second occasion is like the first one. <p> More specifically, it is only in a situation in which it makes sense to suppose that somebody else could in principle discover the rule which I am following that I can intelligibly be said to follow a rule at all. <ref> (Winch, 1958, p. 30) </ref> Thus we have that in order to explain the mental and consequently that, which is of greatest importance to psychology, we need to appeal to the context of the rules and rule-following, which only makes sense in connection with other people. <p> The use of the world rule and the use of the word same are interwoven. (As are the use of proposition and the use of true.) (Wittgenstein, 1968, I, 225.) <ref> (Winch, 1958, p. 28) </ref>. 5 But even though the fact that the subjective can only make sense and is defined by the objective is correct, this does not further our understanding since the very same objective can only make sense in relation to and is defined by the subjective.
