Abstract: Information fusion is the process of deriving a single consistent knowledgebase from multiple knowledgebases. This process is important in many cognitive tasks such as decision-making, planning, design, and specification, that can involve collecting information from a number of potentially conflicting perspectives or sources, or participants. In this brief overview, we focus on the problem of inconsistencies arising in information fusion. In the following, we consider reasoning with inconsistencies, acting on inconsistencies, and resolving inconsistencies.

Reference-contexts: These include preference for more specific information [Poo85], ordered theory presentations [Rya92], preferred subtheories [Bre89], explicit preferences [Pra93], and priori-tised syntax-based entailment <ref> [BCD + 93] </ref>. Non-monotonic logics therefore offer means for analysing inconsistent information and preferences over that information. The ability to reason with inconsistencies is important, since it allows inconsistent information to be explored and analysed. However, there is also a need to act on inconsistencies, and eventually to resolve inconsistencies.

Reference-contexts: For example, disjunctive syllogism does not hold, ((ff _ fi) ^:fi) ! ff, whereas modus ponens does hold. Variations on this theme include [AB75,Arr77,Bat80,PR84,PRN88,CFM91].

This has given rise to a number of logics (for example [MR70,Wag91,BDP93,BCD + 93,BDP95,EGH95]) and truth maintenance systems (for example [Doy79,Kle86,MS88]).

Reference-contexts: A possible solution is to weaken classical logic by dropping some of the infer-encing capability, such as for the C ! paraconsistent logic [dC74], though this kind of weakening of the proof rules means that the connectives in the language do not behave in a classical fashion <ref> [Bes91] </ref>. For example, disjunctive syllogism does not hold, ((ff _ fi) ^:fi) ! ff, whereas modus ponens does hold. Variations on this theme include [AB75,Arr77,Bat80,PR84,PRN88,CFM91].

Reference-contexts: For a review of modal logics in handling inconsistent information see [MvdH97]. Problems of handling default knowledge are closely related to that of handling inconsistent information. Indeed, implicit in default, or non-monotonic, reasoning is the need to avoid trivialization due to conflicting defaults <ref> [BH97] </ref>. There are a variety of non-monotonic logics for handling default knowledge (for reviews see [Bes89,Bre91,GHR94]) with different strategies for avoiding inconsistency by selecting preferred consistent subsets of formulae.

Reference-contexts: As a third example, in the domain of regulation merging, assuming an ordering over regulations can be useful to consistently reason with rules <ref> [CC95] </ref>. This is related to the use of priorities in argumentation for legal reasoning, in particular [Pra93,PS95,PS96,RD96,TdT95]. There are number of ways that this approach can be developed. First, there are further intuitive ways of deriving orderings over formulae and sets of formulae.

Reference-contexts: example, in gathering beliefs, the aim of the fusion process is to build a consistent set of beliefs | a consistent representation of the real world | whereas in regulation merging, the aim is to build a consistent regulation i.e, a set of rules which consistently specifies an ideal world <ref> [Cho97] </ref>. In the following, we discuss some of the features of information fusion in logic.

Reference-contexts: For classical logic, trivialisation renders the reasoning useless, and therefore classical logic is obviously unsatisfactory for handling inconsistent information. A possible solution is to weaken classical logic by dropping some of the infer-encing capability, such as for the C ! paraconsistent logic <ref> [dC74] </ref>, though this kind of weakening of the proof rules means that the connectives in the language do not behave in a classical fashion [Bes91]. For example, disjunctive syllogism does not hold, ((ff _ fi) ^:fi) ! ff, whereas modus ponens does hold. Variations on this theme include [AB75,Arr77,Bat80,PR84,PRN88,CFM91].

Reference-contexts: However, in all of them, the language is based on that of classical logic, and the aim is to preserve features of classical reasoning. For a review of these approaches see [Hun97]. Modal logics have also been developed for reasoning with inconsistent information. For instance, in <ref> [FH86] </ref>, Farinas and Herzig define a modal logic for reasoning about elementary changes of beliefs which is a kind of conditional logic. The accessibility relation associated with the modality aims to capture the relation between a world and the worlds which are obtained after adding a piece of information.

Reference-contexts: There are number of ways that this approach can be developed. First, there are further intuitive ways of deriving orderings over formulae and sets of formulae. These include ordering sets of formulae according to their relative degree of contradiction <ref> [GH97] </ref>. Second, there are a number of analyses of ways of handling ordered formulae and sets of ordered formulae such as dicussed above in Section 2 on logics for inconsistent information. 5 Discussion In general, information fusion is a difficult problem.

Reference-contexts: This logic has more recently been extended in order to take into account the dependances that may exist between the different pieces of information [FH92,FH94] and the influence these dependence links have in the updating process. Another modal conditional logic defined for belief revision is described in <ref> [Gra91] </ref>. Modal logic has also been proposed for consistent reasoning with inconsistent information by using only a consistent subset of beliefs [Lin94]. For a review of modal logics in handling inconsistent information see [MvdH97]. Problems of handling default knowledge are closely related to that of handling inconsistent information.

Alternative compromises on classical logic include three-valued logic [Lin87], four-valued logic [Bel77], quasi-classical (QC) logic [BH95], and using a form of conditioanl logic <ref> [Roo93] </ref>. Another approach is to reason with classically consistent subsets of inconsistent information. This has given rise to a number of logics (for example [MR70,Wag91,BDP93,BCD + 93,BDP95,EGH95]) and truth maintenance systems (for example [Doy79,Kle86,MS88]).

Reference-contexts: There are a variety of non-monotonic logics for handling default knowledge (for reviews see [Bes89,Bre91,GHR94]) with different strategies for avoiding inconsistency by selecting preferred consistent subsets of formulae. These include preference for more specific information [Poo85], ordered theory presentations <ref> [Rya92] </ref>, preferred subtheories [Bre89], explicit preferences [Pra93], and priori-tised syntax-based entailment [BCD + 93]. Non-monotonic logics therefore offer means for analysing inconsistent information and preferences over that information. The ability to reason with inconsistencies is important, since it allows inconsistent information to be explored and analysed.
