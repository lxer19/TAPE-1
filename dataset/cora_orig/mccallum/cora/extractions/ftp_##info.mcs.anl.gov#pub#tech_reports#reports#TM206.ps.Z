Reference-contexts: For example, the Swap program cannot be used in Fortran, so its structured comment should be /*@C @*/ The modifier X indicates that the routine requires the X11 Window System. This is intended primarily for the program bfort <ref> [1] </ref>, which is used to generate Fortran interfaces for systems that do not have X11.

Reference-contexts: The following options control the generation of additional data about HTML-format output that may be used by other programs to automatically generate links to the files created by doctext. -index filename Generate an index file appropriate for tohtml <ref> [2] </ref> (for generating WWW files). This appends to any existing file; make sure that you don't add duplicate entries. -indexdir dirname Set the root directory for the index file entries. <p> For the the hypertext to be useful, there must be an easy way to create links to the generated documents. This section describes how to do this. The information produced by doctext may be used by tohtml <ref> [2] </ref> to generate documents that have extensive cross-links to hypertext versions of their man pages.

Reference-contexts: All of the information is embedded in structured comments, allowing the documentation to be maintained along with the code. The design of the special markup language commands emphasizes readability of the original source code (the structured comment). This approach differs from approaches such as web <ref> [3] </ref>, where special processing must be applied to produce a readable version of the source code.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The tools described in this report are intended to help you create simple man-page-style documentation quickly and easily. Specifically, the program doctext takes C programs and generates nroff (Unix man page format), LaTeX <ref> [4] </ref>, or HTML files. All of the information is embedded in structured comments, allowing the documentation to be maintained along with the code. The design of the special markup language commands emphasizes readability of the original source code (the structured comment).
