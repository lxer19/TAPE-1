Title: STABILIZING THE HIERARCHICAL BASIS BY APPROXIMATE WAVELETS, I: THEORY  
Author: Panayot S. Vassilevski and Junping Wang 
Abstract: This paper proposes a stabilization of the classical hierarchical basis (HB) method by modifying the HB functions using some computationally feasible approximate L 2 -projections onto finite element spaces of relatively coarse levels. The corresponding multilevel additive and multiplicative algorithms give spectrally equivalent preconditioners, and one action of such a preconditioner is of optimal order computationally. The results are regularity-free for the continuous problem (second order elliptic) and can be applied to problems with rough coefficients and local refinement.

Reference-contexts: The Stokes and elasticity equations in fluid dynamics and material science are two such examples. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present an abstract framework of the algebraic multilevel preconditioning procedure which extends the two-level block matrix factorization method of Bank and Dupont <ref> [3] </ref>. In Section 3 we modify the hierarchical basis by using the exact L 2 -projection operators. In Section 4 we analyze the spectrum of the corresponding multiplicative preconditioner in the finite element application for second-order elliptic operators. <p> Also, a result of spectral equivalence will be established for the additive preconditioner. 2. An Abstract Framework In this section we describe a multilevel preconditioning technique for matrices in block structure. The technique was originated by Bank and Dupont in <ref> [3] </ref> as a two-level procedure. Its analysis and multilevel extensions were later exploited by several researchers including Axelsson and Gustafsson [1], Bank, Dupont and Yserentant [4], and Vassilevski [19, 21]. Let V be an Euclidean space of dimension n equipped with the inner product (; ). <p> The construction of such a basis Y is often difficult in practical computations. In what follows of this section, we present an abstract framework which constructs Y using recursively the two-level technique of Bank and Dupont <ref> [3] </ref>. Assume that the linear space V can be decomposed as follows: (2.4) V 1 V = V 1 1 Here "" denotes the direct sum of subspaces. For simplicity of notation, we have also introduced a subscript "1" since we intend to use the same procedure successively. <p> following version of (6.2a): (6.2b) (r ( 1 + ~ ); r ( 1 + ~ )) (1 fl 2 )(r 1 ; r 1 ); 8 1 2 V k ; ~ 2 V k1 : A derivation of (6.2a) and (6.2b) can be found from Bank and Dupont <ref> [3] </ref> or Axelsson and Gustafsson [1]. We first establish (6.1) for the case i = 1.

Consider the problem of seeking u 2 V satisfying (2.1) Au = b; where A = fa ij g n i;j=1 is a symmetric, positive definite, and sparse matrix.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is general and it applies whenever hierarchical decomposition of the space exists with hierarchical components having a nodal basis, including spaces corresponding to highly nonuniform refined meshes. For recent results exploiting wavelets in the Galerkin method for solving partial differential equations, see Dahmen, Kunoth and Urban <ref> [12] </ref>. Three aspects of the approximate wavelet basis are investigated in this paper. First we show that the block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner (also known as a multiplicative precondi tioner), obtained from the approximate wavelet-modified HB basis, is spectrally equivalent to the corresponding stiffness matrix in the finite element application.

Reference-contexts: The proposed method modifies the hierarchical basis functions by using some approximate L 2 -projections on each level, yielding a basis which is a close relative to the well-known Battle-Lemarie wavelets <ref> [13] </ref>. Such basis functions are of the form (I Q a k1 ) where is any hierarchical basis function at level k and Q a k1 is an approximate L 2 -projection onto the finite element space of level k 1. <p> It follows from the previous section that the modified V (1) k is given by (3.8) V 1 (1) Therefore, the subspaces V 1 k are mutually orthogonal to each other in L 2 (). This modified hierarchical basis shall be called wavelet basis (see <ref> [13] </ref> for more information). The preconditioning methods discussed in x2 are then applicable to the wavelet decomposition, yielding some wavelet preconditioners for the stiffness matrix A. We now describe an equivalent approach for the construction of the wavelet precon-ditioners.

Reference-contexts: Here and in what follows, kk s denotes the norm in the Sobolev space H s () for s = 0; 1. The inequality (a.i) was proved in Oswald [16] (see also [11, 5]) and (a.ii) was originally seen in Yserentant <ref> [27] </ref> (see also [6, 25, 22]). The following result confirms (4.4). Lemma 4.1. Assume that (a.i) holds true. There exists a constant C such that (4.7) s=1 (s) ; v (s) 1 APPROXIMATE WAVELET HIERARCHICAL BASIS STABILIZATION 11 Proof.
