Reference-contexts: In order to obtain a lower bound on the rate of the code, the codewords are constructed as F-valued functions on the edges, rather than the vertices, but a minor variation on the spectral encoding procedure suggested above applies. The paper <ref> [1] </ref> presents an algorithm for performing Fourier analysis on PSL 2 (q) using at most O (n 4=3 log n) operations, for n = jPSL 2 (q)j = O (q 3 ).

This is reduced to O (n 4=3 ) operations in [3]. The calculations of [1] indicate that random Cayley graphs for this group have good expansion properties. Furthermore, the expansion can be evaluated in time O (n 4=3 ) using Fourier analysis. The use of random Cayley graphs for this group relaxes the constraints on block length and subcode length imposed by the explicit constructions.

Reference-contexts: The Fourier transforms at a complete set of inequivalent irreducible representations de termine f via the Fourier inversion formula; see <ref> [3] </ref>. When the parity-check conditions of a code are given by convolution c ? h = 0, these equations can be solved as matrix equations ^c () ^ h () = 0 in the spectral domain, and the (nonsystem atic) codeword is then obtained after taking an inverse Fourier transform. <p> The paper [1] presents an algorithm for performing Fourier analysis on PSL 2 (q) using at most O (n 4=3 log n) operations, for n = jPSL 2 (q)j = O (q 3 ).

Reference-contexts: Similarly, the fact that classical cyclic codes are generated by idempotent polynomials generalizes naturally for nonabelian groups; a generalized cyclic code is generated by a group algebra element with Fourier transforms given by idempotent matrices. III. Codes on PSL 2 (q) The explicit expander codes of <ref> [4] </ref> are constructed using Cayley graphs of the projective special linear group PSL 2 (q) of 2fi2 matrices (mod I) with determinant one over the finite field F q .
