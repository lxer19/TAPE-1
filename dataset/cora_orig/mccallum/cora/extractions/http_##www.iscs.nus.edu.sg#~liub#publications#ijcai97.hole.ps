Title: Abstract  
Abstract: Current machine learning and discovery tec h-niques focus on discovering rules or regularities that exist in data. An important aspect of the r e-search that has been ignored in the past is the learning or discovering of interesting holes in the database. If we view each case in the database as a point in a k-dimensional space, then a hole is simply a region in the space that contains no data point. Clearly, not every hole is interesting. Some holes are obvious because it is known that certain value combinations are not possible. Some holes exist because there are insufficient cases in the database. However, in some situ a-tions, empty regions do carry important inform a-tion. For instance, they could warn us about some missing value combinations that are either not known before or are unexpected. Knowing these missing value combinations may lead to signif i-cant discoveries. In this paper, we propose an a l gorithm to discover holes in databases.
