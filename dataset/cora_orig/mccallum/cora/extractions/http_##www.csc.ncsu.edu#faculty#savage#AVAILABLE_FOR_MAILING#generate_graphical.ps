Abstract: Given a positive even integer n, we show how to generate the set G(n) of graphical partitions of n, that is, those partitions of n which correspond to the degree sequences of simple, undirected graphs. The algorithm is based on a recurrence for G(n), and the total time used by the algorithm, independent of output, is O(jG(n)j), which is constant average time per graphical partition. This is the first algorithm shown to achieve such efficiency for generating G(n) and the direct approach differs from earlier "generate and reject" schemes and the "interval/gap" approach.

It will be convenient to work with the negatives of the ranks, so, for 1 i d (), let r i () = 0 i i . We call r () = [r 1 (); : : :r d () ()] the corank vector of .

Reference-contexts: Both counting and generating can now be done without explicit consideration of intervals and gaps. In <ref> [BS] </ref> we developed a recurrence which allowed jG (n)j to be computed in time 2 O (n 4 ) using O (n 3 ) space. <p> This was a substantial improvement over both the "generate and test" approach, which requires time (jP (n)j), and the approach of identifying/counting partitions in intervals, since the number of intervals appears to grow faster than polynomial. In <ref> [BS] </ref>, jG (n)j is tabulated for even n through n = 220 and jG (220)j = 7; 443; 670; 977; 177. However, the recurrence of [BS] is only for counting, and not for generating, G (n). <p> In <ref> [BS] </ref>, jG (n)j is tabulated for even n through n = 220 and jG (220)j = 7; 443; 670; 977; 177. However, the recurrence of [BS] is only for counting, and not for generating, G (n). In this paper, we use a different recurrence, for the set G (n), to generate directly the elements of G (n) in total time O (jG (n)j), averaging constant time per element of G (n), which is asymptotically optimal.
