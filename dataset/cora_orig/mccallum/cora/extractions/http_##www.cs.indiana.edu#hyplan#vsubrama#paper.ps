Abstract: An expert system was developed to use standardized tests (SATs, ACTs, Achievement Tests, Advanced Placement scores) and high school transcripts to place incoming students in mathematics classes (Precalculus, Calculus I or II, Linear Algebra and Differential Equations). The system, based on about 70 rules, automates a process done previously by faculty, clarifies rules and informal practices, and allows letters, tailored to placement data and conclusions, to be sent to all incoming students and their advisors. The system also was extended easily to place students in computer science classes (Problem Solving and Computing, CS1, CS2). Results compared favorably with placement made by faculty. For many years, the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science has placed incoming students tentatively in mathematics courses on the basis of standardized test scores (SATs, ACTs, Achievement Tests, Advanced Placement scores) and high school transcripts. Before new students arrived on campus in the fall, information was sent to each advisor on the placement of students into Precalculus, Calculus I or II, or Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. Overall this system has worked reasonably well in most cases experiments in past years using locally administered, standard placement tests did not improve the quality of recommendations in any substantive way.
