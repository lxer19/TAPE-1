Reference-contexts: INTRODUCTION Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a major killer in our society: in 1989, 257,524 males and 240,497 females died of CAD in the United States <ref> [2] </ref>. Like other complex common diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and cancer, CAD is difficult to study because the disease "aggregates" in families, but does not "segregate" as if determined by a single Mendelian gene [93, 94].

Reference-contexts: Relationships between traits in the network, as well as the actual levels of particular traits, may be involved in determining risk of disease <ref> [3, 66] </ref>. epigenetic: A disease or other physical trait whose presence or absence is thought to be determined by multiple interacting genes, gene products, and environmental signals. phenotype: The expressed traits of a person; their physical characteristics. genotype: The genetic traits of a person; their genetic characteristics. homeostasis: The tendency to

Reference-contexts: Thus, issues such as what Holland calls "the balance between exploitation and innovation" [51, 52] apply to our population-based fitness GA as well. 5.3.2 Adding immigration to the GA Immigration is an approach developed by Bean and colleagues <ref> [5, 7, 6, 46] </ref> that may help the GA to maintain diversity in the population of strings. This should help counter the effects of premature convergence, which tends to decrease the diversity of the population of strings. <p> We thought this would help improve the rule sets found by the GA by possibly introducing rules to cover new examples. The first variation of immigration we tried was that reported by Bean <ref> [5] </ref>. In this variation, there is no mutation, and immigration of random strings serves to introduce variation into the population. Furthermore, parent selection is random; elitism is required to preserve the best strings (though elitism is already used in our GA).

Reference-contexts: Identification of individuals at risk for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is a major research problem: Although there is evidence that the disease begins early in life <ref> [8, 30, 54, 76, 111] </ref>, symptoms do not generally appear until the fifth or sixth decades [93], and many individuals with CAD go undetected until they suffer a myocardial infarction, more commonly known as a heart attack.

Reference-contexts: The criterion that the rule set be as small as possible might be taken for granted by many machine learning researchers until they grasp what is actually intended here. This is not quite "Occam's Razor" <ref> [10] </ref> as typically discussed in machine learning literature; as usually considered, the Occam's Razor problem is to find the smallest rule set of maximal correctness (however correctness is defined). In our work, we are willing to have less correct rule sets if they are small.

Reference-contexts: Bohanec and Bratko in <ref> [11] </ref> consider pruning decision trees to increase simplification at the expense of accuracy.) For the purposes of illustration, let the correctness of a rule set be the percent of correctly classified positive examples, and let the simplicity be the inverse of the number of rules (one over the number of rules). <p> this is estimated to produce a rule set with 124 rules that correctly explains 218 positive examples and 296 negative examples, for a fitness of .67 and an accuracy of 89.7%. (Pruning as a method of increasing the simplicity of a decision-tree classification is explored by Bohanec and Bratko in <ref> [11] </ref>.) To be even more fair to decision trees in this comparison, we would want to prevent the tree from ever making a split that put only one example in a node in the first place. This might lead GID3* to choose different attributes to branch on.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the physical and emotional toll this disease takes on society, CAD is estimated to be associated with $8 billion in direct health care costs and with $60 billion in economic costs per year in the United States <ref> [12] </ref>. Kannel and Schatzkin observe that few other diseases can kill in a matter of minutes, and that therefore, CAD is a disease that demands a preventive approach [61].

Reference-contexts: The final set of nodes (those with no subnodes) are called leaf nodes, and are labelled with a class name. The decision tree cycle is illustrated in Figure 3.6. One of the best known decision-tree systems is Quinlan's ID3 [83]. (Precursors to ID3 include CLS [56] and CART <ref> [13] </ref>.) As an evaluation measure, ID3 uses a measure from information theory, called Shannon's uncertainty measure, intended to minimize the expected number of tests needed to classify an example. <p> Though this emphasis on understanding the rules is not common to all classification tasks, it does exist in many. For example, the designers of CART <ref> [13] </ref> argue that "An important criterion for a good classification procedure is that it not only produce correct classifiers (within the limits of the data) but that it also provide insight and understanding into the predictive structure of the data" (emphasis in the original). * An additional consideration is that noise

Reference-contexts: This approach was suggested to me by Schlimmer [88]; the approach is also recommended by Buntine in <ref> [15] </ref>. This section presents the results from running GID3* on some well-known machine learning datasets, to be compared against the common-disease research task. Note that this evaluation does not take into account additional considerations such as asymmetry or size of rule set.

Reference-contexts: In Figure 3.6, the rule under formation (indicated by the "current node" at the bottom of the figure), could be read as "Cholesterol low, Triglycerides high". 3.3.3 Autoclass Autoclass <ref> [17, 57] </ref> is a classification program that uses Bayesian statistical techniques to determine the probable number of classes in a dataset and probabilistic descriptions of these classes. <p> Then it repeatedly: 1. Searches for the best description of the current classes. 2. Reassigns each example to the class it belongs to with the highest probability. This iterative process typically converges in about 20 iterations, according to Cheeseman et al. <ref> [17] </ref>. Each convergence is called a "try". Autoclass will save the classification obtained from the current try, and will start a new try, continually looking for a better classification. The system will continue until a maximum time limit is reached, or a maximum number of tries has been reached. <p> As noted by Cheeseman et al. <ref> [17] </ref>, given observed data D and a hypothesis H, Bayes' law is often expressed as: P (HjD) = P (D) In English, the probability that the hypothesis explains the data (P (HjD)) is proportional to the probability of observing the data if the hypothesis were known to be true (P (DjH)) <p> The dataset was first used by Michalski and Chilausky [70], and has also been used frequently in the machine learning literature <ref> [69, 84, 97, 16, 102, 17] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: first was chosen because it is somewhat of a standard in the machine learning community; the latter two were chosen because they were developed at the University of Michigan and because they compare favorably to other decision tree systems in terms of their predictive accuracy on a range of tasks <ref> [32, 33, 18] </ref>. ID3 and GID3* both use information gain as the evaluation measure; O-Btree uses the orthogonality measure. ID3 creates standard decision trees that branch on every value of every attribute; GID3* allows for "default" branches, and O-Btree creates binary trees.

Reference-contexts: With this view, disease can be seen as the result of the homeostatic physiological network breaking down. According to Childs <ref> [19] </ref>, "The reality (of disease) is the inability of one person's homeostasis, conditioned by his genotype and a lifetime of special experiences, to maintain equilibrium; neither genes nor environment `cause' disease, it is simply that the organism is unsuited for adaptive action in one, or several environments."

Reference-contexts: This would allow multiple studies of people who are at high risk at many different ages. However, longitudinal studies are rarely funded because of their great expense and the length of time they tie up financial resources. (One notable exception to this is the Framingham Study <ref> [24] </ref>.) It has been shown that first-degree relatives of adults with CHD have a 2.5-7-fold increase in the risk of early coronary death compared with relatives of controls [72, 48], and that a person who has an early myocardial infarction (before 50 years of age) is likely to have a family

Reference-contexts: That is, the attribute that partitions the data into subsets that appear to be the least random. When ID3 splits on an attribute, it creates one branch for each possible value of that attribute. Other decision tree systems, such as GID3* <ref> [32] </ref>, create binary trees, creating exactly two branches for each split. Some decision tree systems also use other evaluation measures. <p> Quinlan's solution to this was to alter the information gain function by dividing by a term that factored in the number of examples for each attribute-value in the current node. Orthogonality measure | In <ref> [32] </ref>, Fayyad develops a metric called the orthogonality measure, applicable to binary trees, which is specifically designed to favor partitions that keep examples of the same (or similar) class together. Several studies have been done regarding the effects of using different metrics. <p> Variations in the splitting criterion: The traditional decision tree formulation splits on one attribute at a time and creates branches for all possible values of that attribute, but variations on this are certainly possible. Default branches | Fayyad <ref> [32, 34] </ref> shows that there are a number of disadvantages to creating branches for all values of an attribute (such as the "irrelevant values problem", the "reduced training data problem", and the "missing branches" problem). <p> One possibility is to branch on specific values of the attribute, and leave other values as a single "default" branch. Binary trees | It is also possible to always create exactly two branches at a split. Fayyad <ref> [32] </ref> shows that splitting a single attribute-value from all other attribute values produces a binary tree that is logically equivalent to the default branches approach described above (the same number of leaf nodes, etc.), and that the binary approach is preferable for a number of reasons. <p> first was chosen because it is somewhat of a standard in the machine learning community; the latter two were chosen because they were developed at the University of Michigan and because they compare favorably to other decision tree systems in terms of their predictive accuracy on a range of tasks <ref> [32, 33, 18] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: That is, similarity is determined at the level of what the strings look like, rather than how they function. The Crowding approach is illustrated in Figure A.3. Fitness Sharing I In the original formulation of fitness sharing by Goldberg and Richardson <ref> [42] </ref>, strings are penalized for the presence of other similar strings in the population. (That is, their fitness is decremented.) This approach defines a neighborhood for each string (for example, a boundary of all points at the same Euclidean distance from the string).

Reference-contexts: In fact, it has been shown that even when two optima of equal fitness exist, a GA run will tend to converge on one or the other of these optima (see, for example, Goldberg and Segrest <ref> [43] </ref> or Smith et al. [99]). This phenomenon is called "genetic drift" (borrowing a term from natural genetics). Development of theory and mechanisms to encourage the GA to evolve a set of co-adapted rules, rather than a single optima is a current research topic in the GA community.

Reference-contexts: While there are a number of approaches that might have been used, the one we've chosen is based on the approach used by Greene and Smith in their COGIN system <ref> [44] </ref>. Some other approaches are described in Appendix A. The COGIN approach was selected because it explicitly evolves a population of rules that cover different niches, without requiring an explicit statement of the number of rules expected. <p> As used by Smith et al. this approach uses a syntactic measure of fitness, but they claim that it wouldn't have to be. This approach to fitness sharing is illustrated in Figure A.5. COGIN Greene and Smith <ref> [44] </ref> developed another approach to encouraging niche formation. This method also uses two fitnesses for each string. The first, the "raw fitness" is calculated from the fitness function.

Reference-contexts: The chance of being selected as a parent is then proportional to the string's index in population, rather than proportional to its fitness. According to Grefenstette <ref> [45] </ref>, "Ranking helps prevent premature convergence by preventing `super' individuals from taking over the population within a few generations. <p> This approach is thought to increase the selection pressure towards more fit individuals. <ref> [45] </ref> Niching | When niching is used, strings are divided into subpopulations (either for the entire GA run or for the purpose of fitness evaluation only), and the fitness of each string is calculated relative to others in the subpopulation. <p> This section will present the specific implementation of the GA used for this thesis work. The variations of the GA that were explored in the course of the thesis will be explained as the specific experiments are discussed. The GA described here was implemented using the Genesis software package <ref> [45] </ref>, described in Section 5.2.2. 5.2.1 Representation Each string in the GA population represents a rule to be matched against our data set. <p> That is, all of the attributes-values must be matched for the rule to match a data point, but each attribute-value may match any one of the possible values specified in the rule. 5.2.2 Software We used the software package Genesis <ref> [45] </ref> for the implementation. To use Genesis, the user provides the system with the string representation and the fitness function; a number of parameters must also be set.

Reference-contexts: Excluding angina pectoris, sudden death is the first and only symptom of CAD in 18% of all heart attacks in males and 24% in females <ref> [61] </ref>. In addition to the physical and emotional toll this disease takes on society, CAD is estimated to be associated with $8 billion in direct health care costs and with $60 billion in economic costs per year in the United States [12]. <p> Kannel and Schatzkin observe that few other diseases can kill in a matter of minutes, and that therefore, CAD is a disease that demands a preventive approach <ref> [61] </ref>. The etiology of CAD is difficult to study because in the majority of cases, an individual's risk of developing CAD is the consequence of complex interactions among the effects of many factors, both genetic and environmental, and cannot generally be ascribed to a single cause.

Reference-contexts: It is believed that in most cases, an individual's risk of disease is the consequence of the complex interactions (i.e. the nonadditive relationships) of many genetic and environmental factors <ref> [101] </ref>. Furthermore, different multiple-factor etiologies may be needed to explain the risk associated with different subgroups of individuals. There exists an increasing inconsistency between what is known about the underlying biology of CAD and the research methods used to study the disease in the population at large [94, 101]. <p> Furthermore, different multiple-factor etiologies may be needed to explain the risk associated with different subgroups of individuals. There exists an increasing inconsistency between what is known about the underlying biology of CAD and the research methods used to study the disease in the population at large <ref> [94, 101] </ref>. Studies of the risk factors associated with CAD and other complex common diseases have relied almost exclusively on traditional statistical modeling procedures, which do not take into account the possibility of interactions between risk factors and risk of disease, nor the possibility of multiple etiologies. <p> Such diseases also cluster in families, but an alteration in a single gene is necessary and sufficient to cause disease. In addition to the relatively simple monogenic model of disease inheritance, Strohman <ref> [101] </ref> defines two means of inheritance that are more complex. In a polygenic model of disease inheritance, there is a many-to-one relationship between genes and disease. Several different genes must all be present in an individual for the disease to be present. <p> to Childs [19], "The reality (of disease) is the inability of one person's homeostasis, conditioned by his genotype and a lifetime of special experiences, to maintain equilibrium; neither genes nor environment `cause' disease, it is simply that the organism is unsuited for adaptive action in one, or several environments." Strohman <ref> [101] </ref> argues that we've evolved from a certain gene pool, which was (presumably) advantageous in the primitive environment in which it evolved, and that our genes are simply not adapted for the environment of the modern world. <p> According to Strohman <ref> [101] </ref>, "the major research paradigm of modern biomedicine and disease is undermined by evidence from molecular biology itself, as well as from epidemiology." However, a paradigm shift raises the challenging task of developing analytic tools appropriate to the new paradigm. <p> We want to allow for more than one model and for complex interactions because the one-model, overlook-interactions, approach is inconsistent with what is known about the underlying biology <ref> [101] </ref>. Previous one-model approaches sought to minimize the error in describing the original data set (that is, they attempted to find the one best model to "explain" the data), but it is unusual to use the separate "test set vs. training set" approach common in machine learning.

Reference-contexts: Ten Kate et al. <ref> [103] </ref> argue that the familiar aggregation of heart disease is not entirely explained by the familial clustering of currently known coronary risk factors (perhaps because environments and anthropometric factors tend to follow the patterns of inheritance too, but are difficult to measure.) These explain some of the reasons that family history

Reference-contexts: The primary approach investigated in this thesis research is genetic algorithms (GA's). They have demonstrated success on complex problems (see, for example, <ref> [77, 23, 22, 106] </ref>) and are more flexible than most machine learning approaches in that they do not impose rigid assumptions about the search space (for example, many machine learning systems assume that the attributes are independent, and many do not attempt to model interactions between attributes and the class). <p> The proposed paradigm shift is similar to those in other fields, as researchers are noting that the phenomena they seek to model are more complex than traditional approaches allow for; this interdisciplinary movement is called complexity studies <ref> [106, 73, 92, 86] </ref>. This shift to studying "complex adaptive systems" brings with it a need for new analytic tools that are suited to the new paradigm; the characteristics of these tools will be discussed in Section 2.3.

(There are many other examples of studies that use family history as the dependent variable; for example, <ref> [72, 37, 100, 109] </ref>.) One consideration is that people who have already had heart attacks can not be included in the study.
