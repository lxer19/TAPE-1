Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." Abstract This memo presents an integrated, server-based mechanism for the efficient support of the IP Integrated Services (IIS) model in ATM networks, namely the Multicast Integration Server (MIS) architecture. Instead of viewing IP-ATM multicast address resolution and QoS support separately, the approach in this memo is to consider such issues in an integrated manner. In particular, the MIS architecture defines how a layer-3 setup protocol as RSVP can be mapped to and integrated with a layer-2 multicast address resolution protocol as EARTH EAsy Multicast Routing THrough ATM clouds. With the use of EARTH, several ATM point-to-multipoint connections with different QoS parameters can be associated to a single IP multicast address. An RSVP server (RSVP-S) within the MIS is used to distribute RSVP messages inside the ATM cloud and to set the corresponding QoS state in the address resolution table of EARTH (setup protocol mapping). In addition, this memo defines a quantized heterogeneity model which supports, together with the MIS, advanced IIS features as QoS heterogeneity and dynamic QoS changes in IP-ATM networks.

The EARTH table (MARPTable) of the MIS contains the information on all the receivers as best-effort receivers for the multicast session MS1. The senders, following the standard RSVP specifications <ref> [1] </ref>, transmit the RSVP PATH messages to the multicast group. The PATH messages originated at S1 are received by R3 and M1. The receiver R3 receives directly the PATH message and it requests the desired reservation by sending a RESV message up to the sender. <p> The PATH messages originated at S2 are delivered following the same rules; in this case, both M1 and M2 acts like egress routers toward the external LANs.

Reference-contexts: This memo bases on [3] for what is related to service mapping issues. We are considering EARTH, not MARS <ref> [4] </ref>, not because of differences in address resolution between the two (the multicast ARP support in EARTH mainly follows perfectly specified parts of that in MARS ), but because of architectural advantages of EARTH support for source specific and quality of service specific groups, support for multicast shortcuts (bypassing IP routers) <p> On end-stations (or Mrouters) no particular communication between the local EARTH client and the local instance of RSVP is needed. Note that MIS operations are concerned only with the management of control messages (EARTH and RSVP). The MIS itself is not a MultiCast Server <ref> [4] </ref>, and has nothing to deal with data distribution, that is performed by the standard ATM infrastructure by means of point-to-multipoint VCs. 2.2 Functional description: setup protocol mappings Functionally, the MIS architecture implements the RSVP protocol for layer-3 resource reservation, and EARTH as a layer-2 multicast address resolution protocol with QoS <p> To distinguish between EARTH and RSVP control messages we propose a simple dispatching module in the MIS (refer to [5]).

Reference-contexts: This server-based model contrasts to the usual RSVP distributed processing (see also <ref> [7] </ref> for a server-based approach to enforce reservations on shared/switched Ethernet). More details about the RSVP server approach followed in this memo can be found later in section 2.1.

Reference-contexts: The QH model represents a compromise between the "full" and the "limited heterogeneity" models specified in <ref> [10] </ref>, by supporting a limited number of QoS levels, included the best-effort class, for each multicast session. Since each ATM point-to-multipoint VC provides a single QoS level, a limited number of ATM point-to-multipoint VCs per session are allowed. <p> As a consequence, each receiver can choose the desired QoS level only among the allowed ones. The best-effort point-to-multipoint connection guarantees that each receiver can always join a multicast group even if no resources for a QoS connection are available, as required in <ref> [10] </ref>. The QH model does not define any guidelines about how to manage information about the allowed QoS levels in a multicast session. Moreover, it does not pose any constraint about the strategy that must be followed in the allocation of a given data stream on the ATM VCs. <p> The quantized heterogeneity model provides significant savings of resources in this case. Supporting only a (configurable) limited amount of QoS levels (i.e. QoS VC) per session, the MIS architecture (i) prevents wasting of network resources unavoidable with the "full heterogeneity model" <ref> [10] </ref>, and (ii) provides more flexibility than the single-QoS "limited heterogeneity" model, in full accordance with the receiver-initiated philosophy of RSVP. Scalability. Major scalability issues depend on the MIS-centric organization of the MIS architecture.
