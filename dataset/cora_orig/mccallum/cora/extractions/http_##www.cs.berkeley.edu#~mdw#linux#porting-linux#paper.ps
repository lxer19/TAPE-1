Title: Porting Applications to Linux  
Author: Matt Welsh 
Date: 26 January 1995  
Abstract: Linux is a free UNIX clone for the personal computer, primarily the x86 architecture. It is mostly compliant with POSIX.1, and supports many of the features of BSD and System V variants of the UNIX operating system, at the library and system call level. In this paper I discuss the main issues related to porting UNIX applications to the Linux environment.
