Title: Routing by Distributed Recursive Computation and Information Reuse

Abstract: In a networking environment, Quality-of-Service (QoS) routing plays an important role in the provision of real-time services with guaranteed throughput and bounded end-to-end delay. Its task is to find a routing path which has sufficient resources to support the requirements imposed by the applications. We propose several distributed algorithms for bandwidth-constrained routing and delay-constrained routing. The algorithms are presented in the form of distributed recursive computation (DRC). DRC computes the global routing state in a distributed, recursive fashion and often leaves useful information at intermediate nodes during the process. Information-reuse schemes are studied to utilize such information in order to reduce the overall overhead.

Reference-contexts: Salama et al [5] proposed a distributed algorithm for the delay-constrained routing. The Sun's algorithm [6] improved the 19 worst-case complexity of the Salama's algorithm. While guaranteeing the bounded end-to-end delay, both algorithms use heuristic approaches trying to minimize the cost of the found route. Chen and Nahrstedt <ref> [1] </ref> proposed a generic QoS routing algorithm, from which a family of distributed algorithms are derived, considering bandwidth, delay, cost and their combinations. None of the above distributed algorithms leaves global state information at intermediate nodes during the process of routing, and thus there is no information reuse. <p> None of the above distributed algorithms leaves global state information at intermediate nodes during the process of routing, and thus there is no information reuse.

The global QoS state at each node, such as the delay and cost vectors in [5] and the information table in [6], is typically updated periodically by the link-state or Bellman-Ford algorithm. <p> None of the above distributed algorithms leaves global state information at intermediate nodes during the process of routing, and thus there is no information reuse.

Reference-contexts: When the average link delay is larger than 100ms, the results are of less interest because the delay requirements of the routing requests are hardly satisfied, considering that the average delay requirement is 100ms. 4 Related Work Much work has been done in QoS routing.
