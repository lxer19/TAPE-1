Abstract: Creating realistic virtual humans requires models that resemble real humans both visually and behaviorally. Physical and behavioral fidelity in human modeling is the focus of research and development work at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Human Modeling and Simulation. In this article, we briefly describe the Center's human modeling paradigm, Jack R fl , and our research activities, including Jack's Spreadsheet Anthropometric Scaling System (SASS) and its Free-Form Deformation model.

Reference-contexts: We are also developing non-uniform scaling techniques to enable us to create models that can reflect different somatotypes, thus a muscular person will have a different appearance from an obese person of the same weight and stature. SASS SASS <ref> [1] </ref>, Spreadsheet Anthropometric Scaling System, is a spreadsheet-like system which allows flexible interactive access to all anthropometric variables needed to size a computer-based human figure. SASS enables the user to create precise computer human models, that can be manipulated using the Jack software.

Reference-contexts: Most articulated virtual human models consider the human body segments as rigid bodies, which introduces problems of smoothness and continuity. Using free form deformation we overcome these difficulties, obtaining a virtual model with more realistic appearance. Jack The Center's core technology is an interactive, programmable graphics platform named Jack <ref> [2] </ref>. Ongoing research with Jack focuses principally on two areas: human behavior simulation and human factors engineering. Human behavior simulation covers physical human behaviors, such as walking, balance, climbing, and grasping. Human factors engineering uses Jack as a design tool that supports testing a product for human usability. <p> All the angle computations are hidden. Human behavior functions, such as viewing cones, for "seeing" what the agent sees, balance, for automatically adjusting posture based on the agent's center of mass, and collision detection, make the human model more realistic than other systems. Jack is described in detail in <ref> [2] </ref>. Human Models Our human model is represented by a set of segment geometries connected by joints [10]. Not all joints in the human body are represented by a joint in the model, e.g., the sternoclavicular joint. Joints that do get represented in the model are the synovial joints [2] with <p> in <ref> [2] </ref>. Human Models Our human model is represented by a set of segment geometries connected by joints [10]. Not all joints in the human body are represented by a joint in the model, e.g., the sternoclavicular joint. Joints that do get represented in the model are the synovial joints [2] with one to three degrees of freedom and specified joint limits. Special modules are created to model more complicated joint complexes, such as the shoulder [13, 2] and spine [9, 2]. <p> Joints that do get represented in the model are the synovial joints [2] with one to three degrees of freedom and specified joint limits.

Joints in the model are defined in such a way that they rotate about the approximate anatomical joint centers in real humans. Polyhedral Human Models The polyhedral human model is composed of simple geometries totaling about two thousand polygons for easy manipulation and scaling (Fig. 3). <p> For each of these segments, there are three dimensions required, namely, length, width, and thickness. Also, the body joint information for the twenty joints considered must be available. Anthropometric Group Global Data Command Menu Local Data Dialog Line The psurf (polyhedral surface) <ref> [2] </ref> geometry of each segment is scaled by real measurements for a person or percentile measurements for some specifiable population. SASS generates "figure files" with the appropriate description of the segment dimensions and joint limits of the virtual human figure.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, a given person's dimensions can be used in the creation of a virtual human model. Fig. 2 shows the front and side images of a real person. Data is extracted from these images <ref> [3] </ref>, in order to create a virtual human such as that of Fig. 3. Figures created by SASS can be used in multiple situations. For example, consider the task of correctly sizing a driver's seat. Fig. 4 shows three different sizes of humans within such an environment.

Reference-contexts: There are several nice properties obtained by choosing free form deformation. * Continuity and smoothness: As mentioned above, this control level handles local deformations. Maintaining smoothness and continuity becomes the main goal in this level. As we choose third order B-spline functions, a C 2 continuity is guaranteed <ref> [4] </ref>. * Relatively inexpensive in computation time: Generally speaking, the total number of control points is much smaller than the total number of segment nodes. <p> Simplifying functions in the lower control level will significantly reduce the computation time. A third order B-spline function is simply a second order polynomial func tion <ref> [4] </ref>. Control Mesh Design - Higher Control Level Since the free form deformation is not designed for an articulated model, there are some undesired properties which make control mesh design difficult. In a deformable model, segments are classified into two categories.

Reference-contexts: Related to the problem of scaling the virtual body is that of obtaining the necessary anthropometric information. As one option, a standardized human model can be created, based on a given statistical population, (e.g., the Army General Forces <ref> [5] </ref>). Alternatively, a given person's dimensions can be used in the creation of a virtual human model. If the starting point is a set of images of the given individual, the automatic extraction of measurements from the images becomes a major issue. <p> SASS enables the user to create precise computer human models, that can be manipulated using the Jack software. On one hand, one can create a standardized human model, based on a given statistical population, e.g., Army General Forces <ref> [5] </ref>. These type of models have the desirable property of being generated with statistically smoothed data, which make them ideal for testing purposes, such as sizing of working spaces. On the other hand, one can use a specific person's dimensions in the creation of a virtual human model. <p> SASS enables the user to create precise computer human models, which can be manipulated using Jack.

Reference-contexts: Fig. 4 shows three different sizes of humans within such an environment. Active Shape Estimation, Segmentation and Joint Determination of Humans In this section, we present a novel, active, integrated approach to identify reliably the parts of a moving human and estimate their shape and motion (see <ref> [6] </ref> for more details). We present the determination of joint locations and some of the experiments demonstrating the technique. Basic Notions We developed [12, 7, 8] a physics-based framework which provides deformable models with broad geometric coverage along with robust techniques for inferring shape and motion from noise-corrupted data. <p> To assign forces from the orphan data to the two models we use a novel algorithm, that allows the weighted assignment of a given orphan datapoint to both deformable models <ref> [6] </ref>. We compute these weights, whose sum is always equal to one, by minimizing an appropriately selected energy expression. Once we compute all the forces from the datapoints to the two models we estimate the shape and motion of the two new models.

The fixed zone remains unchanged during bending. The relocation zone is translated and rotated rigidly. Through the application of Lagrangian mechanics, we developed a method <ref> [7] </ref> to systematically convert the geometric parameters of the solid primitive, the global (parameterized) and local (freeform) deformation parameters, and the six degrees of freedom of rigid-body motion into generalized coordinates or dynamic degrees of freedom.

Reference-contexts: Free Form Deformation - Lower Control Level There is more than one way to implement the lower control level. In our case, we choose B-spline based free form deformation. Although free form deformation was originally designed as a tool in modeling an object from a simple primitive <ref> [11] </ref>, it can also be used as an animation tool. In our case, we implement a third order B-spline based free form deformation. There are several nice properties obtained by choosing free form deformation. * Continuity and smoothness: As mentioned above, this control level handles local deformations.
