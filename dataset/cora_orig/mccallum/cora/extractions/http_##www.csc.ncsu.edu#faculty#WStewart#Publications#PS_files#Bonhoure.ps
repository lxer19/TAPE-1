Abstract: Markov chains with periodic graphs arise frequently in a wide range of modelling experiments. Application areas range from flexible manufacturing systems in which pallets are treated in a cyclic manner to computer communication networks. The primary goal of this paper is to show how advantage may be taken of this property to reduce the amount of computer memory and computation time needed to compute stationary probability vectors of periodic Markov chains. After reviewing some basic properties of Markov chains whose associated graph is periodic, we introduce a "reduced scheme" in which only a subset of the probability vector need be computed. We consider the effect of the application of both direct and iterative methods to the original Markov chain (permuted to normal periodic form) as well as to the reduced system. We show how the periodicity of the Markov chain may be efficiently computed as the chain itself is being generated. Finally, some numerical experiments to illustrate the theory, are presented.

Reference-contexts: This is true regardless of whether the underlying model used is a queueing network, (see Sauer et al. [16]) or a stochastic Petri net, (see Ajmone-Marsan et al. <ref> [1] </ref> or Florin et al. [8]). In this paper, however, we shall choose examples from the queueing network domain. Any queueing network in which the service time distributions are exponential may be immediately described by a CTMC.

Reference-contexts: This result may be interpreted as a consequence of the better spectral properties of R p with respect to those of S (see section (2.3)). Other iterative methods like the method of Arnoldi, <ref> [2] </ref>, GMRES, [15], etc., whose only involvement with a matrix involves multiplying it with a vector, can also be applied to the reduced scheme (13). Again these methods will make use of the better spectral properties of T p with respect to those of Q.

Reference-contexts: For the non-NCD case, the savings in memory go from 3.2 to 10.4 and the savings in computation time from 2.0 to 2.4. For the NCD case, the savings in memory are from 3.4 to 4.9 and in computation time from 2.5 to 4.4. 6.5 Aggregation/disaggregation In <ref> [5] </ref>, it is shown how iterative aggregation/disaggregation algorithms [17, 20] can be used to solve Markov chains that are nearly-completely decomposable (NCD) and cyclic. The states are first partitioned into blocks according to the NCD structure of the Markov chain. <p> Secondly, the states within each block are ordered according to the periodicity 22 of the Markov chain. The method involves the solution of a generally small stochastic coupling matrix as well as the solution of the block equations. For more information, the user is invited to consult the references, <ref> [5, 20] </ref>. For the current study, Gaussian elimination was used for the solution of both the coupling matrix and the individual blocks. The results obtained are presented in table 7.

Reference-contexts: One possible approach involves postmultiplying the matrix Q with M 1 . When M 1 approximates Q D , the Drazin generalized inverse <ref> [6] </ref> of Q, the iteration matrix, (I QM 1 ); has one eigenvalue equal to one and the rest close to zero. In this situation, Q D plays a role similar to that of the matrix inverse in the case of systems with regular matrices.

Reference-contexts: The stationary solution of a CTMC may be found by solving a homogeneous system of linear equations. When the state space is finite, a large number of numerical solution methods may be used, (Stewart, <ref> [7] </ref>; Philippe et al. [13]). These include direct solution methods such as Gaussian elimination, iterative methods like Gauss-Seidel and SOR, subspace iteration methods like the method of Arnoldi and GMRES, preconditioned methods, and iterative aggregation/disaggregation methods.

Reference-contexts: Indeed all non-zero eigenvalues of S appear in p-tuples, each member of a tuple having the same multiplicity. In other words, if is a non-zero eigenvalue of S, then fi k k = 1; 2; ; p1, is also an eigenvalue of S with the same multiplicity as , <ref> [9] </ref>. Since (fi k ) p = 1 for k = 0; 1; p 1, the matrix R = S p has exactly p eigenvalues equal to one and no others of modulus one. <p> In section 4, we shall show that it may be of interest to use either of the reduced schemes ((13) or (11)) instead of the corresponding original equation ((1) or (3)). All of the blocks R i have the same spectrum <ref> [9] </ref>. Since the eigenvalues of R are those of S raised to the power p, the spectrum of R p is more suitable for many iterative methods than that of S.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Performance evaluation studies of discrete event systems (DES) such as computer systems, telecommunication networks, manufacturing systems, etc, often reduce to the problem of 1 solving a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC), (see, for example Kleinrock, <ref> [10] </ref>). This is true regardless of whether the underlying model used is a queueing network, (see Sauer et al. [16]) or a stochastic Petri net, (see Ajmone-Marsan et al. [1] or Florin et al. [8]). In this paper, however, we shall choose examples from the queueing network domain.

Reference-contexts: This may be explained by the fact that the ordering given by MARCA is well suited to Gauss-Seidel iterations. Indeed, this ordering also takes the flow of the Markov chain into account and thus leads to long "high stepping transitions" <ref> [11] </ref>. These results should therefore be interpreted, not as a poor performance by the periodic ordering, but rather as a desirable characteristic of the ordering provided by MARCA.

Reference-contexts: In the case in which the model consists of general service time distributions, it is still possible to study this as a CTMC by representing each non-exponential distribution as a PH-type distribution (Neuts, <ref> [12] </ref>), although at the price of increasing the state space of the CTMC. The stationary solution of a CTMC may be found by solving a homogeneous system of linear equations.

Since LU decompositions are cheaper when applied to the matrix Q rearranged into normal cyclic form, it is likely that the same is true for ILU decompositions. <p> The Markov chain corresponding to the second case is nearly completely decomposable (NCD), while the first is not. We choose these two distinct cases since it is well known that numerical iterative methods are sensitive to the degree of decomposability of the Markov chain, <ref> [13] </ref>. The results were obtained by means of the software package, MARCA: Markov Chain Analyzer, [18]. The construction of the infinitesimal generator by MARCA consists of constructing the graph G C described previously. <p> The only purpose of the tests results that we present is to show the benefits of using the periodic structure, and not to provide a comparison among the different methods themselves. Such a comparison has been performed in <ref> [13] </ref>. For this reason, the results are presented method by method. The following are considered: 1. Gaussian elimination 2. Gauss-Seidel 3. Fixed point iteration with threshold based ILU preconditioning 4. Arnoldi's method with threshold based ILU preconditioning 5. <p> This method requires an additional parameter, the size of the Krylov sub-space. We chose a value of 10 for this parameter, the value recommended in <ref> [13] </ref>.
