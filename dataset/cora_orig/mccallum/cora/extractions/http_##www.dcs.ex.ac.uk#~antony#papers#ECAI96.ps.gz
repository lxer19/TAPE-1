Title: Taking dimension seriously in qualitative spatial reasoning  
Author: Antony Galton 
Abstract: Space has a key role to play in the description of the physical world, and an important subgoal of AI is to provide a sound theoretical foundation for its qualitative description. The central notion of much recent work is that of a region, and the emphasis has been on the systematic description of qualitative properties of regions, relations amongst regions, and relations amongst these relations. Such work has tended to downplay dimensional issues, which tend to fall foul of the bewitchment of our spatial intuition brought about by point-set topology. In this paper we attempt to emancipate qualitative spatial reasoning from this bewitchment by taking dimension more seriously. A preliminary discussion in general terms is followed by an attempt to axiomatise the required notions, taking as our basis a restricted version of Classical Extensional Mereology, enriched by a topological notion of bounding.

Reference-contexts: With space, as with time, an important subgoal of AI is to provide a sound theoretical foundation for qualitative description. The systematic investigation of such foundations is more advanced in the case of time than of space, particularly following the pioneering work of Allen <ref> [1] </ref>. Lately, however, work on space has made some progress too, often with explicit connections to the existing temporal work. The work of Cohn's spatial reasoning group in Leeds [13] has been particularly prolific and influential, and other important work has been done by Egenhofer and his co-workers [5, 6].

Reference-contexts: We shall found our conceptual analysis of space on the basis of both mereological and topological primitives. Note that it is possible to base mereology and topology on a single primitive, that of `connection'; this was first worked out by Clarke <ref> [2] </ref>, and subsequently formed the basis of the RCC calculus of Cohn et al. [13]. In the present paper, however, we shall keep the topology separate from the mereology. We shall use a variant of the Classical Extensional Mereology originating in the work of Lesniewski.

Reference-contexts: In the work of Cohn's group, with examples such as modelling the spatial transformations characteristic of a force-pump [12] or an amoeba <ref> [3] </ref>, or the characterisation of a toroidal region [8], the typical spatial entities are variously-configured chunks of three-dimensional space. A possible reason for this insistence on dimensional homogeneity is that a number of conceptual puzzles arise as soon as one tries to mix regions of different dimensions.

Then S bounds E, as does any of the contributory parts of S, such as N , the surface we call the northern hemisphere.
