Abstract: The advent of mobile computing has made power consumption a critical design factor. There has been little systematic consideration of the power sources for mobile computing systems. This paper presents a class of system-level metrics intended to make a systematic study more feasible and to more accurately reect the trade-off between battery life and performance. An example involving the clock frequency of a CPU shows the possible impact of the nonlinearity, an impact not predicted by existing metrics. Results of an initial attempt to verify the example are presented and explained. The paper concludes with drawbacks of the metric and possible extensions to overcome these drawbacks.

Reference-contexts: Existing metrics assume that batteries are a source of constant energy. This assumption is the basis of statements such as ...if the energy source is a battery, halving [the power by halving the clock frequency] is equivalent to doubling the computation time, while maintaining constant computation per battery life <ref> [1] </ref>. The available energy of a battery, however, is affected by the load current. The two effects of the load on the battery capacity that seem most likely to be exploitable by mobile systems are nonlinearity and recovery.

Reference-contexts: For an ideal battery, a = 0, i.e. the capacity is constant, but for real batteries, a ranges up to 0.7 for most loads, and like k is determined by the chemical family and physical design of the battery <ref> [2] </ref>. Peukerts formula does not capture the recovery effect, but it is useful as a first-order approxi mation of the battery life for most loads. A metric which does not reect the nonlinearity of the battery can be misleading in some cases.

Reference-contexts: If n = r/[a (1-r)], then (1, r) is the point where the 1.0 contours cross. At this value of r, the CPU frequency is optimal, because any change in n will result in a decrease in W n /W. The Navigator 1 wearable computer <ref> [4] </ref> will serve as an example of how the contour plot can be used. The power of the Navigator 1 was measured to be (5.36 + 0.15 x CPU frequency) Watts. The minimum operating frequency of the design is 8 MHz and the maximum is 32 MHz. <p> Whether most systems can operate at this point is a question for further investigation. 4. Results The Navigator 1 is a wearable computer intended for a campus tour application and is fully described in <ref> [4] </ref>. To test the work ratio, the Navigator 1 was modified to run in a continuous loop. The number of loops executed was counted by attaching a logic analyzer to the Navigator 1s address bus and triggering on an address occurring only once per loop. <p> A related question is the range of r for real systems. Both the Navigator 1 and the VuMan 2, another wearable computer described in <ref> [4] </ref>, have a r of 0.8-0.9. High values of r means that systems will need to operate over a wide range of frequencies to take advantage of the battery nonlinearity. 2) Extending the work ratio to cases more complex than CPU frequency.

Reference-contexts: MIPS/W, then, is monotonically increasing, and does not give any sense of diminishing returns. Another metric in the literature power-delay, which for CPUs has the units W/Spec^2 <ref> [6] </ref>. Unlike MIPS/W, the power-delay metric has the property that smaller is better. Again, increasing the clock frequency from F to AF increases its Spec rating by a factor of A, while the power increases by less than a factor of A.

Reference-contexts: However, over the middle range, the assumptions are adequate for an intuitive understanding of the trade-off. The first drawback can be overcome by using a more complex battery model. We are currently investigating the Kinetic Battery Model, KiBaM <ref> [7] </ref>, which allows variable loads over a wider range and provides voltage as a function Clock frequency, MHz Iterations 135 +/- 2 343 +/- 3 Experimental work ratio, W n /W Expected work ratio, W n /W, 1.00 2.49 Ideal battery work ratio, W n /W, 1.00 2.60 Table 1: Results

Reference-contexts: For example, one alternative for the memory system of mobile systems is to use Flash memory for all read-only memory and a small amount of DRAM for scratchpad memory [8][9]. Flash has lower access power <ref> [10] </ref>, so in systems where memory power is a large portion of system power, periods of accessing Flash followed by periods of accessing DRAM will result in a power profile that might allow the recovery effect to be exploited.
