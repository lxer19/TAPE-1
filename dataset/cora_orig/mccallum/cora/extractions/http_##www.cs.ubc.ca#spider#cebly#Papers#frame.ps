Abstract: We describe a logical system and methodology for the natural specification of nondeterministic actions. The logic combines elements of dynamic logic, process logic and the situation calculus and allows one to express alternative (actual and possible) paths or sequences of events. Our system permits a simple solution to the frame problem for nondeterministic actions that completes user-supplied theories of action. While drawing inspiration from Reiter's solution for the deterministic case, some of the main intuitions underlying this solution must be abandoned in the nondeterministic setting due to possible correlations among effects. We show our completion is unambiguous and faithful to our stated intuitions, and that in a deterministic setting our solution is equivalent to that of Reiter. This paper has not already been accepted by and is not currently under review for a journal or another conference. Nor will it be submitted for such during IJCAI's review period.

Reference-contexts: We first describe the semantic models used to interpret actions and action sequences. These models are essentially transition systems, familiar from the study of dynamical systems [12], stochastic processes [15], and dynamic logic <ref> [2] </ref>. Actions are mappings between states of the system, nondeterministic actions leading to several resulting states. <p> Loosely, atomic propo sitions are evaluated according to the truth assignment at First (x). Thus, formulae that do not involve modal operators describe the first state of the path.

Reference-contexts: This perspective has led to an increased emphasis on the representation of actions, and on solutions that can be shown to be correct with respect to restricted classes of action theories <ref> [11, 3, 6] </ref>. One particular approach that fits this mold is the model of Reiter [16], who suggests a syntactic transformation that completes action theories of a particular syntactic form. <p> We introduce a language A ND for reasoning about 2 We focus on discrete, nondeterministic transition systems; however, the intuitions underlying our methodology should be applicable to stochastic and continuous-time systems. 3 nondeterministic actions. (This language is somewhat reminiscent of the language A of Gelfond and Lifschitz <ref> [3] </ref>; we defer comparisons to Section 4.) The language A ND admits two types of statements: action descriptions, that describe the effects of actions; and path descriptions, that describe properties of the actual system trajectory, or course of events. We call a collection of action descriptions an action theory. <p> The role of observations is to rule out certain paths as unactualized. To specify such observations we add path statements to our language A ND . In particular, we are interested in statements that describe the actual path. These take the general form (following <ref> [3] </ref>): after ff (13) Intuitively, this states that a propositional formula holds after the program term ff (for our purposes, a sequence of actions) is executed. <p> In the full version paper we also make a careful comparison of our approach to that of Gelfond and Lifschitz <ref> [3] </ref>. It is quite is easy check that deterministic theories in our language are expressible in their language A, and as we show, their semantics of deterministic action theories is very close to ours.

Reference-contexts: The language of MPL thus combines aspects of SC, dynamic logic (PDL) and process logics <ref> [5] </ref> and bears a direct relationship to our semantic model. Third, we must propose a specific methodology for, and examine the role of, a user's specification of actions.

If the frame problem is indeed one of representation then it seems clear that a precise representational methodology must be tightly coupled with any reasoning mechanism one might put forth.

Reference-contexts: The resolution of such ignorance about action outcomes is a problem separate from the frame problem. Attempts to represent nondeterministic actions using indefinite specifications (e.g., using disjunctions) are forced to make some choice about which transitions are possible. (see, for example, <ref> [8] </ref> where some minimal change that satisfies the disjunction is used). While this convention is tenable, unfortunately it restricts the expressiveness of the action language. By representing nondeterminism and uncertainty using syntactic constructs meant for indefinite specifications, one loses the ability to express true ignorance of action effects.

Reference-contexts: As we describe below, their effect on the state of the world is unambiguous and (under our assumptions) completely known. For instance, Axiom (1) asserts that should an agent be holding a coin, flipping that coin has two possible outcomes, heads or tails. (See <ref> [10] </ref> for a probabilistic action representation similar to this.) In the full version of the paper, we elaborate on an additional type of statement that describes necessary effects of actions, such as Axiom (2). Roughly, our treatment adds the necessary effects to each of the possible effects.

Reference-contexts: This perspective has led to an increased emphasis on the representation of actions, and on solutions that can be shown to be correct with respect to restricted classes of action theories <ref> [11, 3, 6] </ref>. One particular approach that fits this mold is the model of Reiter [16], who suggests a syntactic transformation that completes action theories of a particular syntactic form. <p> Another intuition underlying our solution to the frame problem (as well as the solutions proposed by many others) is that the interpretation should be unambiguous. Intuitively, a theory is unambiguous if for any completely specified state of affairs, it determines the precise effect of any action. Lin and Shoham <ref> [11] </ref> formalize this idea for the situation calculus in deterministic settings. Unfortunately, their formalization renders any theory with nondeterministic actions as incomplete. In the full paper we describe a more robust notion, that of unambiguous theories, suitable for general transition systems, by appeal to a canonical model of a theory.

Reference-contexts: A number of solutions have been proposed in the literature, including the use of nonmonotonic formalisms embodying the default assumption that all facts persist <ref> [13] </ref>. This principle of minimization of change allows one to infer that facts not explicitly mentioned as affected by an action are unaffected.

Reference-contexts: Unfortunately, while our natural inclination is to specify actions in terms of those facts that change and leave unsaid those things unaffected, most logical systems are not tolerant of such implicit assumptions. The frame problem <ref> [14] </ref> is one of action representation: how can actions be specified in a compact and natural way; and how can a reasoning system fill in the blanks, or treat unmentioned facts as unchanging.

However, because correlations of effects are possible in nondeterministic settings, Reiter's method is not directly applicable. The expressive power of MPL can be used to deal with this situation.
