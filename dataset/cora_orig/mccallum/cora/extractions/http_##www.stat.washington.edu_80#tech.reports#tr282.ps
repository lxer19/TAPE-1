Abstract: Friedman (1989) has proposed a regularization technique (RDA) of discriminant analysis in the Gaussian framework. RDA makes use of two regularization parameters to design an intermediate classification rule between linear and quadratic discriminant analysis. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to design classification rules which have also a median position between linear and quadratic discriminant analysis. Our approach is based on the reparametrization of the covariance matrix k of a group G k in terms of its eigenvalue decomposition, k = k D k A k D 0 k where k specifies the volume of G k , A k its shape, and D k its orientation. Variations on constraints concerning k ; A k and D k lead to 14 discrimination models of interest. For each model, we derived the maximum likelihood parameter estimates and our approach consists in selecting the model among the 14 possible models by minimizing the sample-based estimate of future misclassification risk by cross-validation.

Reference-contexts: i x k )(x i x k ) 0 (k = 1; : : : ; K): (1:4) Regularization became an important subject of investigation in discriminant analysis since in many cases the size n of the training data set is small in regard to the number d of variables <ref> (see McLachlan 1992) </ref>, and standard methods such as QDA or even LDA can have a disappointing behavior in such cases. Generally, regularization techniques for discriminant analysis make use of real valued regularization parameters.
