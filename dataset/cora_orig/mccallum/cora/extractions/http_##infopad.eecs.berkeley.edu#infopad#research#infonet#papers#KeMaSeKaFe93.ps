Abstract: Mobile computers using wireless networks, along with multimedia applications, are two emerging trends in computer systems. This new mobile multimedia computing environment presents many challenges, due to the requirements of multimedia applications and the mobile nature of hosts. We present several alternative schemes for maintaining network connections used to provide multimedia service, as hosts move through a nano-cellular radio network. These algorithms modify existing connections by partially reestablishing them to perform handoffs. Using a simple analytical model, we compare the schemes on the basis of the service disruption caused by handoffs, required buffering, and excess resources required to perform the handoffs. Two technological trends of the 1990s are the emerging use of wireless computers and network support for multimedia services. The products of these trends hold forth the promise of being combined in innovative ways to provide applications such as mobile digital video and audio conferencing. The new computing environment presented by wireless multimedia personal communication systems such as discussed in [Sheng92] introduces many challenges, because of the requirements of multimedia applications and the mobile nature of the hosts. Multimedia applications typically have strict requirements such as delay, delay jitter, throughput, and reliability bounds. Real-time network services are designed to guarantee these performance parameters to applications that request them. In order to provide these performance guarantees to individual conversations, approaches such as [Ferrari92] rely on connection-oriented networks and resource reservation. Per-connection resource allocation in a connection-oriented network is necessary to ensure that guarantees will not be violated under conditions of heavy network congestion. (In connectionless network environments, congestion typically causes decreased throughput, increased delay, and even an increased probability of packet loss.) These methods, which are designed for wired networks, do not directly address the mobility of hosts. While these performance guarantees are necessary for the delivery of multimedia data to mobile hosts, our concern in this paper is not providing these guarantees, but instead maintaining the connections in use as a host moves within the network.

Reference-contexts: Many multimedia services, such as audio-video conferencing or video playback, have associated with them performance requirements that must be met to guarantee acceptable service to the users. <ref> [Ferrari90] </ref> describes the requirements that some typical applications place on networks. The Tenet Real-Time Protocol Suite [Fer-rari92] is one approach to providing these real-time performance guarantees in packet-switching networks; this approach relies on resource reservation in a connection-oriented network environment.

Reference-contexts: Prior work related to host mobility does not simultaneously address the issues of connection-oriented service and de-centralized control. Much has been accomplished in the context of providing support for the Internet protocol suite in a wireless environment <ref> [Ioannidis91, Teraoka91] </ref>. However, because its network layer protocol (IP) is connectionless, network performance cannot be guaranteed under conditions of high load. Conversely, the cellular telephone network uses circuit switching to provide connection-oriented services.

Reference-contexts: Assuming the tests succeed, node resources (such as bandwidth) are tentatively allocated, pending the acceptance of this channel at all other participating nodes. On the return pass of a successful establishment, the resources of each node are committed to the channel. <ref> [Mah93] </ref> describes in detail a mechanism and protocol by which real-time channels can be established and managed. We also assume that all connections have at most one MH as an endpoint (e.g., at least one endpoint is a fixed host on the wired network).
