Abstract: Finding human faces automatically in an image is a difficult yet important first step to a fully automatic face recognition system. This paper presents an example-based learning approach for locating unoccluded frontal views of human faces in complex scenes. The technique represents the space of human faces by means of a few view-based "face" and "non-face" pattern prototypes. At each image location, a 2-value distance measure is computed between the local image pattern and each prototype. A trained classifier determines, based on the set of distance measurements, whether a human face exists at the current image location. We show empirically that our distance metric is critical for the success of our system.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Feature and pattern detection in images is a classical computer vision problem with many potential applications, ranging from automatic target recognition to industrial inspection tasks in assembly lines <ref> [1] </ref> [6] [7] [8]. This paper presents a new feature and pattern detection technique for finding slightly deformable objects under reasonable amounts of lighting variation. To demonstrate our technique, we focus on the specific problem of finding human faces in images.

Reference-contexts: We believe that our current approach can in fact be used without modification to perform this new task. All we need is a means of obtaining or artificially generating a sufficiently large example database of human faces at the different poses <ref> [2] </ref>. Second, we would like to demonstrate the versatility and generality of our approach by building a few more feature and pattern detection applications in other problem domains. Some possibilities include industrial inspection applications for detecting defects in manufactured products and terrain feature classification applications for SAR imagery.

Reference-contexts: So far, the focus of research in face recognition has been mainly on distinguishing individual faces from others in a database <ref> [3] </ref>. The task of finding faces in an arbitrary background has often been avoided by either hand segmenting the input image, or by capturing faces against a known uniform background.

Reference-contexts: While the class of all face patterns is probably too varied to be modeled by fixed correlation templates, there are some face detection approaches that use a bank of several cor relation templates to detect major facial subfeatures in the image <ref> [4] </ref> [5]. At a later stage, the technique infers the presence of faces from the spatial relationships between the detected subfeatures. A very closely related approach to correlation templates is that of view-based eigen-spaces [9].

The approach assumes that the set of all possible face patterns occupies a small and easily parameterizable sub-space in the original high dimensional input image vector space.

Reference-contexts: In fact, to make our set of "face" patterns more comprehensive, we even artificially enlarged our data set by adding virtual examples <ref> [10] </ref> of faces to the "face" database. These virtual examples are mirror images and slightly rotated versions of the original face patterns. For "non-face" patterns, the task we have seems more tricky.

Reference-contexts: To detect faces, one has to compile such a set of image invariants and check for positive occurrences of these invariants at all candidate image locations. One image-invariance scheme is based on the local ordinal structure of brightness distribution between different parts of a human face <ref> [11] </ref>. 1.3 Example-based Learning and Face Detection In this paper, we formulate the face detection problem as one of learning to recognize face patterns from examples.
