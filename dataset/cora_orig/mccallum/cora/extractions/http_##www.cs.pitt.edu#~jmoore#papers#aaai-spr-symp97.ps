Title: Desiderata for an Every Citizen Interface to the National Information Infrastructure: Challenges for NLP  
Author: Johanna D. Moore 
Address: Pittsburgh Pittsburgh, PA 15260  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science, and Learning Research Development Center University of  
Abstract: In this paper, I provide desiderata for an interface that would enable ordinary people to properly access the capabilities of the NII. I identify some of the technologies that will be needed to achieve these desiderata, and discuss current and future research directions that could lead to the development of such technologies. In particular, I focus on the ways in which theory and techniques from natural language processing could contribute to future interfaces to the NII.

Reference-contexts: In addition, parsers and part-of-speech taggers can robustly identify the constituents of sentences, e.g., <ref> (Brill 1993) </ref>. Building on these existing technologies would allow an interface in which, say, all noun phrases in a document become mouse-sensitive, and the hyperlinks to other documents are determined on demand by using the noun-phrase (synonyms, etc) as an index to find related documents.

Reference-contexts: One area that is developing technology relevant to this need is research on adaptive hypertext and hypermedia systems, which exploit information about a particular user (typically represented in the user model) to adapt both the hy-permedia displays and the links presented to the user <ref> (Brusilovsky 1996) </ref>. Adaptive hypermedia is useful in situations where the hyperspace is large or the system is expected to be used by people with different knowledge and goals. This is clearly the case for the NII.

Reference-contexts: Promising techniques are already emerging. For example, researchers have developed robust and efficient schemes for extracting and analyzing noun phrases from unrestricted text, e.g., <ref> (Evans & Zhai 1996) </ref>. Other research focuses on inducing conceptual definitions, which describe the local syntactic and semantic context in which relevant concepts are likely to be found (Soderland et al. 1995). To meet the challenges of the NII, new types of automatic indexing schemes will need to be devised.

Reference-contexts: Considerable progress has been made toward systems that perform these tasks for limited domains, user tasks, data and presentation types. For example, extant prototype systems can coordinate text and graphical depictions of devices for generating instructions about their repair or proper use, e.g., Comet <ref> (Feiner & McKeown 1991) </ref> and WIP (Wahlster et al. 1993). These systems generate multimedia presentations from a representation of intended presentation content, and represent progress towards some of the functionality we would like in an every citizen interface.

Reference-contexts: We must explore the usefulness of these ontologies in systems the automatically generate multimedia presentations. Initial work is promising. We are currently designing a system that integrates the notion of communicative planning with task based graphics design <ref> (Kerpedjiev et al. 1997) </ref>. We have developed a stratified archictecture and are attempting to define a domain and media independent language for specifying presentations in order to make it easier to develop IMMPS for new application domains. This work makes use the work on reusable ontologies.

Reference-contexts: Researchers working on the knowledge-based approach to machine translation are developing large reusable ontologies that are both language and domain independent, e.g., (Mahesh & Nirenburg 1995; 1996), and efforts to construct such resources semiautomatically are underway <ref> (Knight & 1994 1994) </ref>. We must explore the usefulness of these ontologies in systems the automatically generate multimedia presentations. Initial work is promising. We are currently designing a system that integrates the notion of communicative planning with task based graphics design (Kerpedjiev et al. 1997).

Reference-contexts: Making progress on these issues will require integrating several ideas coming out of the planning community, including: planning under uncertainty e.g. <ref> (Kushmerick, Hanks, & Weld 1995) </ref>, reasoning about the tradeoff between reactive and deliberative behavior e.g., (Bratman, Israel, & Pollack 1988; Boddy & Dean 1994), planning for contingencies e.g., (Pryor & Collins 1996), and techniques that integrate planning, information gathering, execution, and plan revision (Draper, Hanks, & Weld 1994; Zilberstein & Russell

Reference-contexts: Clearly, the sheer volume of information in the NII and the rapid rate at which it changes will require indexing to be done automatically. Indeed, a simple form of automatic indexing is already being used to support Letizia <ref> (Lieberman 1995) </ref>, an agent that recommends web pages as a user is browsing the web.

Reference-contexts: These systems generate multimedia presentations from a representation of intended presentation content, and represent progress towards some of the functionality we would like in an every citizen interface. For example, these systems can effectively coordinate media when generating references to objects (e.g., "the highlighted knob") <ref> (McKeown et al. 1992) </ref>, and can tailor their presentations to the target audience and situation, e.g., (McKeown 1993; Wahlster et al. 1993). In addition, WIP generates its presentation in an incremental fashion.

Reference-contexts: Some initial steps in this direction have been made. We <ref> (Mittal et al. 1995) </ref> have recently built a system that can automatically generate "explanatory captions" for information graphics which have been generated by the Sage system either completely automatically (Roth & Mattis 1990; 1991) or interactively with the user (Roth et al. 1994).

During the generation process, the system applies abstract rules to determine which text objects should be selectable in the final presentation, i.e., which text objects will have "hyperlinks" associated with them.

However, building agents that can form plans to find information will require that the agents have a model of the content of information resources.

Reference-contexts: Letizia uses a well-known keyword frequency measure that is based on the assumption that keywords that are relatively common in the document, but relatively rare in general, are good indicators of the content of the document <ref> (Salton 1989) </ref>. As Lieberman (1996) points out, this heuristic is not very reliable, but it is easy to compute and "serves as a placeholder for more sophisticated techniques." These more sophisticated approaches will require identifying more structure in the text than keyword-based approaches can extract.
