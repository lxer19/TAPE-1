Abstract: Our research concerns the dynamic processes underlying the rapid increase in the geographic distribution of Lyme disease, currently the most frequently reported vector-borne disease of humans in the United States [10, 1]. More specifically, we ask how spatially localized ecological interactions drive the Lyme disease epidemic at extended spatial and temporal scales. We have developed a parallel discrete event simulation system in C++ for the IBM SP2. The simulation model discussed here models the mouse-tick interaction, an essential element of the epidemic's ecology. The main entities of the simulation are ticks in various stages of development (larval, nymphal, and adult) and mice. We track the behavior of mice and the spread of disease over the course of 180 days (late spring, summer, and early fall). Our goal is to understand patterns in the Lyme disease epidemic at the regional scale through studying the spread of the pathogen across a single white-footed mouse deme.

Reference-contexts: Those nymphs successfully attacking a mouse advance to the adult stage. The adults soon attack deer, where they feed again and also mate. Gravid females drop off the deer they have parasitized and lay their eggs, completing the two-year life cycle <ref> [1, 5] </ref>. The inverted seasonal abundance of the immature-tick stages maintains the spirochete. Nymphs infected transmit the pathogen to susceptible mice in the spring. When summer arrives, newly hatched larvae feed on the same mice, acquire the spirochete, and so complete the cycle of infection.

Reference-contexts: Event Simulation The general components of the simulation system are simulation objects (in the case of Lyme disease these would be mice), events (birth, move, death, getting bitten by ticks, or ticks dropping off an animal), and a simulation engine, consisting of state variables, an event queue, and a clock <ref> [2] </ref>. Events are kept in a priority queue, where the event with the lower scheduled time has higher priority. The simulation is started by introducing some initial events, which are inserted into the event queue. The simulation progresses as events are first removed from the event queue and then processed.

Reference-contexts: There are two main approaches dealing with causality errors [4]: avoiding them, or undoing the potentially incorrect computation, and restarting the simulation. The first approach, known as conservative, was developed by Chandy and Misra <ref> [3] </ref>. The general idea behind the conservative approach is that LPs do not process any new events until there is a certainty that no event with a lower timestamp can arrive. The messages sent between LPs are assumed to be sent in chronological order.

Reference-contexts: 1 Lyme Disease Lyme disease is a zoonosis. Humans acquire a pathogen, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, that normally infects small mammals and an insect vector <ref> [12, 8, 11, 5] </ref>. The blood-feeding vector is the deer tick Ixodes scapularis. Immature ticks (larvae and nymphs) usually feed on the white-footed mouse Peromyscus leucopus. However, immature ticks also may bite a variety of mammals and birds. <p> Those nymphs successfully attacking a mouse advance to the adult stage.

Reference-contexts: The computation is then restarted, and the event e s is processed. Time Warp <ref> [6] </ref> is the best known optimistic protocol. There are several aspects to the rollback. The first one is the need to restore the system state to that just before the time of the straggler. Another aspect is the need to restore the queue of incoming messages.

Reference-contexts: Our simulations extend over the part of the year during which the cycle of infection occurs, the 180 days elapsing between the appearance of questing nymphs and the completion of feeding by the next generation's larvae. Our computational model is termed individual-based <ref> [7] </ref>. Our mouse population is an ensemble of different individuals. We track each individual according to its age, its spatial location on a rectangular lattice, its load of parasitic ticks, and its infection status (susceptible or infected).

Reference-contexts: The individual-based model treats population descriptions, such as frequency of infection among mice and the spread of infected ticks across the lattice, as consequences of events occurring at the level of individual mice <ref> [9] </ref>. A single simulation includes mortality and dispersal, but not reproduction. However, the output of one simulation can be mapped through natality functions to produce the initial condition for the next simulation. 2 Individual-Based Modeling Ecological modeling often involves simulating differential equations which describe various species' rates of population growth.

Reference-contexts: Since we deal with large areas and large numbers of individuals, it is prohibitively expensive to save all the states needed for rollback; therefore, we have turned to an (a) day 1 (b) day 180 (a) day 1 (b) day 180 approach similar to that used in SPEEDES <ref> [13] </ref>, which uses incremental state saving. In our system, when an event is processed, it is placed at the head of the processed event list. When a rollback occurs, the events are removed from the head of the list and are undone.

Reference-contexts: Our gvt calculation might take more than one round of synchronization messages in order to flush out all messages that are in transit, so, in order to make the computation efficient, it is important to overlap computation and communication <ref> [14] </ref>. In our system, when an LP initiates a gvt calculation or receives a gvt calculation message, it enters a quiet mode. In that state the LP receives antimessages and event messages and processes events. The LP might also roll back, and, as a result, send out antimes-sages.
