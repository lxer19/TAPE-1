Reference-contexts: A Kalman filter <ref> [1, 3] </ref> might improve results even more but has not been tried. 2 Since the gradients around the chin tend to be small, the particular choice of aspect ratio seems unimportant. <p> Except for the fixed shape of the object's perimeter, the above formulation is nearly identical to that employed by most contour trackers <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. One minor difference is that the gradient is summed around the entire perimeter rather than just at select points. <p> The tracker overcomes several common problems, including full body rotation, occlusion, and reacquisition. However, the tracker is heavily dependent on the single assumption that intensity gradients outline the subject's head (Note that other trackers exhibit a similar dependence <ref> [1, 3] </ref>). Therefore, it is too fragile to be used alone and must be augmented by other techniques in order to provide a robust, general tracking system. Its low overhead and ability to measure confidence make it a viable candidate as one module in such a system.

Reference-contexts: First, many trackers assume that the subject does not perform any out-of-plane rotation (rotation about an axis parallel to the image plane) and fail when this assumption does not hold. In particular, template-based motion trackers <ref> [7] </ref> are notorious for sliding off an object undergoing this fl This research was sponsored by Autodesk and the Advanced Research Projects Agency's Real-Time Planning and Control program under Contract DACA76-93-C-0017. type of rotation because parts of the object disappear while other parts reappear (The problem of sliding can be alleviated

Reference-contexts: To make the computation less attracted to strong background gradients, all values of the gradient magnitude that are above a certain threshold are mapped to the maximum value. As an alternative to using the gradient magnitude, Nishihara <ref> [12] </ref> has suggested using the square of the dot product of the gradient vector and ellipse normal, which would reduce the attraction to background gradients and eliminate the need for a threshold.
