Abstract: The continuous increase in information necessitates monitoring and display techniques that maximize comprehension yet minimize effort. In this paper, we discuss the use of hypertools, confluent zoom, and graphical encoding of text as solutions to this problem, and we introduce Irwin, an information resource monitoring and display tool. Keyword: visualization

Reference-contexts: With information taken from any number of tools at any time, displaying a comprehensive summary in a limited space becomes a formidable task. Zooming provides a popular method for interacting with a large information space. The Pad++ interface <ref> [1] </ref> uses zooming as its primary navigation method. The user starts with an overview of the entire information space and selects a portion of interest. The interface zooms in on that section, replacing the existing view with an enlargement of the selected portion.

Reference-contexts: Each line of text is mapped to a line of pixels in the display. Thus, by looking at the graphical representation, the user can see the layout of the text. The SeeSoft program visualization tool <ref> [2] </ref> augmented this display by mapping lines of code to lines of pixels, then coloring the lines of interest according to parameters such as author or date.

Reference-contexts: Just as a fisheye camera lens magnifies certain objects while shrinking others, fisheye displays provide local detail about certain objects while 4 still showing the global context in the entire data space <ref> [3, 9] </ref>. The user can click anywhere on the summary view to change the focus. The region in focus appears in the list view. * The list view shows a portion of the names represented in the summary view.

Reference-contexts: In some manner, attributes of the text in the document must correspond to attributes of graphics. Author, date, and size could be encoded with the color, size, and shape of graphical objects. The pixel-to-character mapping employed in the history-enriched digital objects project <ref> [4] </ref> exemplifies one possible encoding. Each line of text is mapped to a line of pixels in the display. Thus, by looking at the graphical representation, the user can see the layout of the text.

Reference-contexts: Alternatively, a collection of tools could be bundled as hypertools, where separate programs run simultaneously and communicate with each other. This hypertool concept is in keeping with the philosophy of allowing independent tools cooperate as seen in program environments like Field [7] and Yeast <ref> [5] </ref>. Field integrated a wide variety of Unix tools using a message-based integration mechanism. Yeast widened the domain to include all event-action applications. Since these techniques make use of existing tools and mechanisms, an updated tool would require little or no change to the environment.

Reference-contexts: The graphical summary view (second from the left) contains a coded line representing each recently received message. The text views provide detailed information about a limited set of messages. send was included in Tk to encourage the development of hypertools that can be connected and reused in interesting ways <ref> [6, pp.244-5] </ref>. The different levels in the confluent zoom is described in detail in Section 4. The large amount of information combined with the limited space necessitates a graphical encoding method.

Reference-contexts: Sorting and searching capabilities would provide easier access to the information desired by the user. In keeping with our goals for Irwin, these capabilities should require little effort from the user. Possibilities include document lenses <ref> [8] </ref> or gestural sorts. * Extended scope of information access. Many sources of information require monitoring, including phone messages, images, faxes, shared files, and printer queues. Currently Irwin requires the author to write a Tcl/Tk wrapper to process the desired information.
