Title: Loose Synchrony in Relaxation Oscillator Networks with Time Delays

Abstract: Coupled relaxation oscillators have been shown to exhibit robust properties of synchrony and desynchrony. We study a network of such oscillators with the inclusion of time delay in the coupling. Analytic results for a pair of oscillators show loose synchrony as a stable solution for a wide range of initial conditions and time delays. Computer simulations show a network of oscillators with time delay coupling can display loose synchrony. Simulations of oscillator networks with variations in time delays and connection strengths between oscillators demonstrate loose synchrony is still achieved.

Reference-contexts: The propagation speed of neural signals is typically 1 m/s in unmyelinated axons of the brain [3]. Since some fibers are known to extend over several millimeters <ref> [1] </ref>, time delays can become a significant percentage of the period of oscillation and therefore, may significantly affect information processing. Small delays can cause considerable changes in the behavior of delay differential equations [6] and networks of coupled phase oscillators [8].

Reference-contexts: For two uncoupled oscillators, the time difference is constant, even though the euclidean distance between them is always changing. Another useful definition for this system is that of loose synchrony (see <ref> [4] </ref> for biological relevance). Two oscillators are loosely synchronous if the time difference between their jumps to the RB is less than half the time spent on the t 2 t 1 0 y 2 O 1 O 2 O 1 URB, .
