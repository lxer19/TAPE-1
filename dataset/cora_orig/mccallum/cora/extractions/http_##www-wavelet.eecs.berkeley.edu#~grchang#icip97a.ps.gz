Abstract: Wavelet thresholding with uniform threshold has shown some success in denoising. For images, we propose that this can be improved by adjusting thresholds spatially, based on the rationale that detailed regions such as edges and textures tolerate some noise but not blurring, whereas smooth regions tolerate blurring but not noise. The proposed algorithm is based on multiscale edge detection and image segmentation and then thresholding the coefficients of different regions with adaptive thresholds.

Reference-contexts: One method that has received considerable attention in recent years is wavelet thresholding, an idea that noise is removed by killing coefficients that are insignificant relative to some threshold, and whose attractiveness is due to its simplicity and effectiveness. On the theoretical side, Donoho and Johnstone <ref> [1] </ref> have shown this technique to possess some asymptotic minimax optimality properties. For image applications, it has shown success for various types of noise such as white random noise and compression artifacts [2, 6]. <p> An extreme case of eliminating coefficients is the detection of multiscale edges [3], where all but the coefficients corresponding to edges are eliminated, a sensible idea when the noise power is so large as to render all the image details irrecoverable. The aforementioned thresholding techniques in <ref> [1, 2, 6] </ref> rely on the likelihood that significant coefficients are due to the signal, while insignificant coefficients are due to noise, and there is no spatial discrimination to such processing (i.e. same threshold throughout).

The modulus maxima of the first scale is assigned to be at the same locations as the modulus maxima of the second scale. The chain of modulus maxima are labeled as EDGE pixels.

RESULTS The "cameraman" image is used as the test data, with additive iid N (0; ) noise. The wavelets described in <ref> [4] </ref> are used in 3 scales of nonsubsampled wavelet decomposition. The adaptive threshold scheme is compared with uniform thresholding and Wiener filtering (the version in the MAT- LAB image processing toolbox).

Reference-contexts: Such a classification resembles image segmentation, and has more success in the space domain rather than the transform domain. The segmentation is done by calculating a variance image, and then thresholding it between certain amplitudes <ref> [5] </ref>. Each pixel of the variance image is defined as V [i; j] = m;n2C where f [i; j] is the intensity of the discretized image, and C is the neighborhood around pixel location [i; j] (a 5 fi 5 window is used here). <p> These holes can be closed by combinations of standard binary image operations called erosion and dilation which belong to a class of operations collectively described as morphological operations <ref> [5] </ref>. The erosion operation turns OFF an ON pixel which has at least one OFF neighbor; dilation looks for an ON pixel and turns ON all of its immediate neighbors.
