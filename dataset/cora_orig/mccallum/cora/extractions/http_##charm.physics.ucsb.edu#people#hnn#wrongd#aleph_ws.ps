Reference-contexts: The rate of DCSD processes D 0 ! K + is expected to be of the order of 2 tan 4 C ~ 0:6% <ref> [1] </ref>, where C is the Cabibbo angle. Within the framework of the Standard Model the D 0 - D 0 mixing rate R mix is expected to be well below present experimental bounds [2, 3].

Reference-contexts: Within the framework of the Standard Model the D 0 - D 0 mixing rate R mix is expected to be well below present experimental bounds [2, 3]. While short distance effects from box diagrams are known to give a small contribution (R mix ~ 10 10 ) <ref> [4] </ref>, long distance effects from second-order weak interactions with mesonic intermediate states may give a much larger contribution but are subject to large theoretical uncertainties (R mix ~ 10 7 10 3 ) [5].

There are many extensions of the Standard Model which allow a D 0 - D 0 mixing rate significantly larger than the Standard Model prediction, for example models with lepto-quarks, with two-Higgs-doublet, with fourth quark generation and supersymmetric models with alignment [6, 7].

Experimental evidence for mixing within the current experimental sensitivity would therefore be an indication of new physics. The search for DCSD or mixing necessitates the identification of a change in the charm quantum number between production and decay of the D 0 .

Reference-contexts: To build the D fl candidate the surviving track pairs are combined with an extra charged track, the `soft pion' ( s ), of low momentum, typically less than 4 GeV=c <ref> [11] </ref> (the limits on momentum are fixed by kinematics and resolution effects). In order to reduce the combinatorial background, the energy of the D fl candidate is required to be greater than half the beam energy.
