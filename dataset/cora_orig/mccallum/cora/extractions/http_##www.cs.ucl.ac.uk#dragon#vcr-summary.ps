Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The tools currently used in multimedia conferences on the Internet use IP multicast to transmit data to all other participants in the conference <ref> [1] </ref>. Experience indicates that there is a need for a mechanism to record and playback both the audio and video of the multicast video conferences. When recording, both audio and video streams need to be archived, with the possibility of stream synchronisation on replay.

Reference-contexts: It is the final state of the workspace that is important rather than a sequenced recording and playback.

Reference-contexts: Some multimedia recording and playback systems aim to produce high quality, synchronised video with attention paid to playback strategies <ref> [7] </ref>. Others are interested in high speed discs and storage structures using, for example, RAID disc technology [8, 9]. Most aim to be video-on-demand systems [10, 11]. VCR is not intended to be a video-on-demand service, in the way this term is usually used.

Reference-contexts: For example, one could show 1 seconds worth of frames for every 20 seconds or minute of real video. This will give a fast forward view of the video. Techniques for encoding indexes into video have been devised at many places including MIT and Berkeley <ref> [12] </ref>. These access digital video to create index information. Because multimedia conferencing and distance learning as a whole use data compression, it is pertinent to devise these new techniques which use the compressed video directly.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore as this technique will generate whole images at a regular frequency it will be possible to view a video sequence in a fast-forward mode. When using video data compression, such as the H.261 encoding <ref> [13] </ref>, the encoded data stream contains changes from the previous image. The changes take the form of Inter frames and Intra frames. Inter frames are used for small local changes, and Intra frames are used for large changes.

Reference-contexts: The extensions will also allow authorised users to start a recording of a certain conference at a specified time. It is expected that support for recording conferences announced in the sd session directory tool be included <ref> [14] </ref>. 3. Implementation We intend to build VCR in such a way that it can be deployed in various configurations, both at UCL and at other sites worldwide. The design will accommodate a large configuration, with a large optical jukebox, a fast workstation front-end, plus a fast disc cache.
