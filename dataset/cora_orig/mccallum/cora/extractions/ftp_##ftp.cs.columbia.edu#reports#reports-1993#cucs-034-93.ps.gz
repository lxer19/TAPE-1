Author: Vincenzo Auletta Alberto Negro Giuseppe Parlati 
Date: November 5, 1993  
Abstract: Technical Report CUCS-034-93 Abstract In this paper we determine the minimal number of yes-no queries needed to find an unknown integer between 1 and 1000000 if at most four of the answers may be erroneous.

Reference-contexts: The Questioner has to find it by asking queries of the form "x 2 Q?", where Q is an arbitrary subset of f1; 2; : : :; 1000000g. The Responder provides "yes" or "no" answers, some of which may be erroneous . In <ref> [1] </ref>, Berlekamp , studing Binary Simmetric Channels with Feedback, introduced two very useful concepts: the State of the problem when some questions have been already answered, and the Weight of a state. All the known results are fundamentally based on these concepts. <p> Following Berlekamp's idea <ref> [1] </ref>, we define the weight of each state U = (A; B; C; D; E) as follows: Definition 2 Let U = (a; b; c; d; e) be the Ulam set when q questions remain to be asked.
