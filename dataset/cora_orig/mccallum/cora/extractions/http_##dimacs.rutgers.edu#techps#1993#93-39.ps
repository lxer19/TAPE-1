Title: The Simplex Algorithm with a New Primal and Dual Pivot Rule  
Author: Hsin-Der CHEN Panos M. PARDALOS and Michael A. SAUNDERS 
Date: June 14, 1993  
Abstract: We present a simplex-type algorithm for linear programming that works with primal-feasible and dual-feasible points associated with bases that differ by only one column.

Reference-contexts: Let B be a basis in A, so that AQ = ( B N ) for some permutation Q, and let Bx B = b, B T B = c B and r = c A T . An iteration of the primal simplex method <ref> [Dan63] </ref> can be briefly described as: Given B such that x B 0, if r 0, then stop; otherwise, update B. The dual simplex method is: Given B such that r 0, if x B 0, then stop; otherwise, update B.

Reference-contexts: Related Work Many pivot rules are known for simplex-type algorithms. For example, a large number are described in [TZ92]. Under certain circumstances the proposed algorithm is equivalent to Lemke's method <ref> [Lem65] </ref>, as discussed in Section 6, but otherwise the algorithm appears to be new. 2. The Main Feature For problem (P ), let B P and B D be bases in the primal and dual simplex methods respectively. <p> The new basis is B D . 6. Relationship to Lemke's Method There is a similarity between the new algorithm and Lemke's <ref> [Lem65] </ref>. If the initial nonsingular basis B corresponds to a primal-feasible vertex of (P ), then both algorithms are exactly the same (they follow the same path from that vertex to the solution).

Reference-contexts: When they are reconsidered, we have to check that B P is primal feasible. If not, a new vertex must be constructed as in 2 (a)-2 (c). 8. Experimental Results 7 8. Experimental Results The algorithms (original and variational) have been coded in MATLAB <ref> [MLB87] </ref> and compared with the simplex method with least-reduced-cost pivot rule (also coded in MATLAB). Full pricing was used in all methods. Some random test problems were generated with the following properties. All constraints (except for non-negativity) are tangent to a unit ball. None of the constraints is redundant.
