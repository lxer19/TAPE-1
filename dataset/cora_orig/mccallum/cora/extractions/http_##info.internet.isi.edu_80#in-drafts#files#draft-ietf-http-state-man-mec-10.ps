Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as ``work in progress.''

Reference: [DMK95] <author> Kristol, </author> <note> D.M., ``Proposed HTTP State-Info Mechanism'', available at &lt;http://portal.research.bell-labs.com/dmk/state-info.html&gt;, </note> <month> September, </month> <year> 1995. </year> <title> [Netscape] ``Persistent Client State -- HTTP Cookies'', </title> <note> available at &lt;http://www.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html&gt;, undated. </note>
Reference-contexts: Unless such cookies are exchanged over an encrypted path, the account information they contain is highly vulnerable to perusal and theft. 9. OTHER, SIMILAR, PROPOSALS Apart from RFC 2109, three other proposals have been made to accomplish similar goals. This specification began as an amalgam of Kristol's State-Info proposal <ref> [DMK95] </ref> and Netscape's Cookie proposal [Netscape]. Brian Behlendorf proposed a Session-ID header that would be user-agent-initiated and could be used by an origin server to track ``clicktrails.'' It would not carry any origin-server-defined state, however. Phillip Hallam-Baker has proposed another client-defined session ID mechanism for similar purposes.
Reference: [RFC2068] <author> Fielding, R., Gettys, J., Mogul, J., Frystyk, H., Berners-Lee, T., </author> <title> ``Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1'', RFC 2068, </title> <month> January, </month> <year> 1997 </year>
Reference-contexts: TERMINOLOGY The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.1 specification <ref> [RFC2068] </ref>. Host name (HN) means either the host domain name (HDN) or the numeric Internet Protocol (IP) address of a host. The fully qualified domain name is preferred; use of numeric IP addresses is strongly discouraged. <p> The following grammar uses the notation, and tokens DIGIT (decimal digits), token (informally, a sequence of non-special, non-white space characters), and http_URL from the HTTP/1.1 specification <ref> [RFC2068] </ref> to describe their syntax. av-pairs = av-pair *(";" av-pair) av-pair = attr ["=" value] ; optional value attr = token value = token quoted-string Attributes (names) (attr) are case-insensitive. White space is permitted between tokens. <p> Max-Age=value OPTIONAL. The value of the Max-Age attribute is delta-seconds, the lifetime of the cookie in seconds, a decimal non-negative integer. To handle cached cookies correctly, a client SHOULD calculate the age of the cookie according to the age calculation rules in the HTTP/1.1 specification <ref> [RFC2068] </ref>. When the age is greater than delta-seconds seconds, the client SHOULD discard the cookie. A value of zero means the cookie SHOULD be discarded immediately. Path=value OPTIONAL. The value of the Path attribute specifies the subset of URLs on the origin server to which this cookie applies.
Reference: [RFC2109] <author> Kristol, D.M., Montulli, L., </author> <title> ``HTTP State Management Mechanism'', </title> <type> RFC 2109, </type> <month> February, </month> <year> 1997. </year>
Reference-contexts: The method described here differs from Netscape's Cookie proposal [Netscape], but it can interoperate with HTTP/1.0 user agents that use Netscape's method. (See the HISTORICAL section.) This document reflects implementation experience with RFC 2109 <ref> [RFC2109] </ref> and obsoletes it. 2. TERMINOLOGY The terms user agent, client, server, proxy, and origin server have the same meaning as in the HTTP/1.1 specification [RFC2068]. Host name (HN) means either the host domain name (HDN) or the numeric Internet Protocol (IP) address of a host.

Reference-contexts: the state information that passes between an origin server and user agent, and that gets stored by the user agent. 2.1 Requirements The key words ``MAY'', ``MUST'', ``MUST NOT'', ``OPTIONAL'', ``RECOMMENDED'', ``REQUIRED'', ``SHALL'', ``SHALL NOT'', ``SHOULD'', ``SHOULD NOT'' in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <ref> [RFC2119] </ref>. 3. STATE AND SESSIONS This document describes a way to create stateful sessions with HTTP requests and responses.
