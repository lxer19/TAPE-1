Abstract: We consider the discrete time problem of optimally dispatching a single, finite capacity shuttle in a two terminal system under incomplete state observations. Passengers arrive to each terminal and must be moved to the other terminal. The durations of successive shuttle trips follow a general distribution, but have a lower bound D 1 . There is an information delay of I time units between the two terminals. That is, if at one terminal, the shuttle controller observes the history of the arrival process at that terminal with no delay, while observations of the history of the arrival process at the other terminal are delayed by I units of time, where I D 1 . We impose convex holding costs, for waiting customers and a linear dispatching

Reference-contexts: We believe that the finite horizon undiscounted problem with time-varying independent batch arrival processes is not unrealistic for shuttle dispatching systems such as people movers <ref> (see Barnett 5 1973) </ref>. For this reason, our finite horizon solution treats the case of time-varying arrivals and the possibility of fi = 1. 2.1. The Finite Horizon Problem Consider a finite horizon T and 0 &lt; fi 1.

Reference-contexts: Without loss of optimality <ref> (see Chapter 6 of Kumar and Varaiya, 1986) </ref> we restrict attention to the class of policies which are functions of the information state. We proceed as follows.

Reference-contexts: Note that Lemma 2.2 would still hold for V () 4 Lemma 2.3 gives a sufficient condition for the minimum of two submodular functions to be submodular <ref> (see Chapter 1, Section 4, Ross 1983) </ref>. This result will be used in Lemma 2.4 to prove the submodularity of the value function.
