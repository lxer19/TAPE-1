Abstract: In this paper we explore some implications of viewing graphs as geometric objects. This approach offers a new perspective on a number of graph-theoretic and algorithmic problems. There are several ways to model graphs geometrically and our main concern here is with geometric representations that respect the metric of the (possibly weighted) graph. Given a graph G we map its vertices to a normed space in an attempt to (i) keep down the dimension of the host space, and (ii) guarantee a small distortion, i.e., make sure that distances between vertices in G closely match the distances between their geometric images. In this paper we develop efficient algorithms for embedding graphs low-dimensionally with a small distortion. Further algorithmic applications include: * A simple, unified approach to a number of problems on multicommodity flows, including the Leighton-Rao Theorem [37] and some of its extensions. We solve an open question in this area, showing that the max-flow vs. min-cut gap in the k-commodities problem is O(log k). Our new deterministic polynomial-time algorithm finds a (nearly tight) cut meeting this bound. * For graphs embeddable in low-dimensional spaces with a small distortion, we can find low-diameter decompositions (in the sense of [7] and [43]). The parameters of the decomposition depend only on the dimension and the distortion and not on the size of the graph. Given faithful low-dimensional representations of statistical data, it is possible to obtain meaningful and efficient clustering. This is one of the most basic tasks in pattern-recognition. For the (mostly heuristic) methods used in the practice of pattern-recognition, see [20], especially chapter 6. Our studies of multicommodity flows also imply that every embedding of (the metric of) an n-vertex, constant-degree expander into a Euclidean space (of any dimension) has distortion (log n). This result is tight, and closes a gap left open by Bourgain [12].

Reference-contexts: Mapping the vertices of G to the rows of M is an embedding of G to the d-dimensional space L, spanned by the rows of M . The norm is induced by the unit sphere B = L " <ref> [1; 1] </ref> s , the intersection of L with the unit cube in R s . The fact that M implements G implies that the above mapping is an isometry of G into the normed space (L; B). <p> Proof: The m-Cube embeds isometrically in l m 1 . The lower bound follows from the fact that the m-Cube contains a 2m-Cycle as an isometric subgraph. Consequently, the infinite cubic grid in R m has dimension m. Moreover, for the part of the grid G = <ref> [1; : : : ; n] </ref> m , not only does dim (G) = m, but also dim c (G) = m for any c n 1 m . This bound can be obtained using volume arguments as described in a previous section. <p> Conjecture 8.4: If dim (G) = d, then bw (G) O (k (d) n 1 1 d polylog (n)). This bound is tight as exhibited by the discrete cube ([1; n 1 d ] d ). The case d = 2 can be solved using <ref> [1] </ref>. A question raised in [12] and [5] is to estimate the least = c (n) so that every n-point metric space can be embedded in a -dimensional normed space with distortion c.

Reference-contexts: Here we establish a better tradeoff that depends only on the dimension and the distortion at which the graph is embeddable, not on the number of vertices. For many algorithmic applications of low-diameter decompositions, see <ref> [7] </ref> and [16]. Graphs embeddable in a d-dimensional normed space with a small distortion have balanced separators of only O (d n 1 1 d ) vertices. If the embedding is given, such separators can be found in random polynomial time. For closely related work see [49]. 3. <p> The combination of these two approaches is discussed in [46]. We now turn to problems where graph metrics have a role. A low-diameter decomposition of a graph (see [43], <ref> [7] </ref>, [16]) is a (not necessarily proper) coloring of the vertices with k colors, so that every connected monochromatic subgraph has diameter D. <p> They can also be covered by "patches" so that each r-sphere (r any positive integer) in the graph is contained in at least one patch, while no vertex is covered more than d + 1 times. The diameter of each such patch is (6d + 2)dr (compare with <ref> [7] </ref>). Moreover, the patches may be (d + 1)-colored so that equally colored patches are at distance 2. That is, there exist low-diameter decompositions with parameters depending on the dimension alone (Theorem 7.1). 4. Low-dimensional graphs have large diameter, diam (G) n O ( 1 (Lemma 5.6). Algorithmic consequences 1. <p> The diameter of the decomposition is the least ffi such that any two vertices belonging to the same connected component of a block are at distance ffi in the graph. Modifying this definition in the spirit of <ref> [7] </ref>, we consider coverings of G wherein distinct blocks may have nonempty intersections. Diameters of coverings are defined as for decompositions. The degree of a covering is the largest number of blocks to which any vertex may belong. <p> Remark 7.2: Combined with Theorem 3.2 we obtain a decomposition to O (log n) blocks of diameter O (log 3 n), and a covering of diameter O (log 3 n) with degree O (log n), results slightly inferior to the optimal (O (log n); O (log n)) from [43] and <ref> [7] </ref>. Proof: We prove the case c = 1, the general case then follows easily. Throughout the proof we use l 1 norm.

Reference-contexts: Particularly relevant are notions of dimension that emerge from such considerations, see, e.g., chapter 5 in <ref> [8] </ref>. The possibility of embedding graphs in spaces other than Euclidean and spheric geometry is very appealing, and hardly anything has been done in this direction (but see [59]). We have also said nothing about modeling geometric objects with graphs, which is a related vast area.

We show later some examples of graphs with isometric dimension n 2 . The highest isometric dimension among n-vertex graphs is currently unknown (but see <ref> [9] </ref> and [63]). The l 1 norm is universal in that, as Lemma 5.1 shows, it realizes all graphs (in fact, all finite metric spaces).

Reference-contexts: What are the algo rithmic and combinatorial implications in this more general context? Here are some of the answers provided in this paper: 1. We develop a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that embeds every finite metric space in a Euclidean space with minimum distortion. Bourgain <ref> [12] </ref> had shown that every n-point metric can be embedded in an O (log n)-dimensional Euclidean space with a logarithmic distortion, and our algorithm finds embeddings which are at least as good. Better embeddings are provided for particular families of graphs. 2. <p> The second condition is necessary for expander graphs. The similarity between this dichotomy and that of positive/negative curvature in geometry still awaits a satisfactory explanation. Low-dimensional models for finite metric spaces have previously been studied mostly by functional analysts (see [5], [9], <ref> [12] </ref>, [19], [28], [31], [32], and [48]). Study of graph metrics has also led to the notion of spanners (see [2], [51], and [58]) and hop-sets [15]. <p> Finding good embeddings 1. In Theorem 3.2 we show: There is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that embeds every n-point metric space (X; d) in a Euclidean space with distortion arbitrarily close to the optimum c 2 (X ). By <ref> [12] </ref>, c 2 (X) = O (log n). In random polynomial time X may be embedded in l O (log n) 2 with distortion (1 + *) c 2 (X ) (for any * &gt; 0). <p> This is because the length of the image of a unit vector under a random projection is strongly concentrated around p Our general results on near-isometric embeddings are summarized in the following theorem: Theorem 3.2: 1. ( Bourgain <ref> [12] </ref>, see also [32], [48] ). Every n-point metric space (X; d) can be embedded in an O (log n)-dimensional Euclidean space with an O (log n) distortion. 2. <p> This bound is tight as exhibited by the discrete cube ([1; n 1 d ] d ). The case d = 2 can be solved using [1]. A question raised in <ref> [12] </ref> and [5] is to estimate the least = c (n) so that every n-point metric space can be embedded in a -dimensional normed space with distortion c.

Reference-contexts: This embedding may be found in random polynomial-time. In fact, it is enough to map l m 2 isometrically into a random m-dimensional subspace of l 2m It is not hard to see, and is well known (see <ref> [18] </ref>) that any n points in Euclidean space can be isometrically embedded into l O (n 2 ) 1 . In particular, for any finite metric space X, c 1 (X) c 2 (X). For the deterministic algorithm in Claim 4, start with the algorithm in Claim 2. <p> Therefore any universal norm must contain a copy of l 1 . (Lest the reader suspects that l 1 is universal as well, we remark that K 2;3 is not embeddable in this norm, viz. <ref> [18] </ref>.) It is therefore of interest to also study dim (G) (and dim c (G)), the least k such that G can be isometrically embedded in l k 1 (with distortion c).

Reference-contexts: All the referenced work notwithstanding, this short discussion leaves out large amounts of relevant work, for example, on embedding graphs in particular families of graphs such as d-dimensional lattices, cubes, squashed cubes etc. (see <ref> [27] </ref>, [62]). Particularly relevant are notions of dimension that emerge from such considerations, see, e.g., chapter 5 in [8]. The possibility of embedding graphs in spaces other than Euclidean and spheric geometry is very appealing, and hardly anything has been done in this direction (but see [59]).

Reference-contexts: Geometric models of graphs can be classified as either (i) topological models, (ii) adjacency models, or (iii) metric models. The topological approach is mainly concerned with graph planarity and embeddability of graphs on other 2-dimensional manifolds (see <ref> [34] </ref> for a recent survey). It also deals with 3-dimensional embeddings of a graph, mostly in the context of knot theory. (See Welsh's book [61] for some of these developments.) Particularly fascinating is the way in which geometric/topological considerations come up in the theory of forbidden minors [56].

Reference-contexts: In an adjacency model, the geometry respects only the relation of adjacency/nonadjacency of vertices, but not necessarily the actual distance. A prime example for this approach is the Koebe-Andreev-Thurston Theorem (see <ref> [36] </ref>, [3], [4], and [60]) that every planar graph is the contact graph of openly disjoint planar discs.

Reference-contexts: The geometry of graphs offers an excellent framework for studying multicommodity flow problems. In particular, our methods yield a very short and conceptual proof for several theorems that relate the value of the multicommodity flow in a network to the minimum cut in it (e.g., the Leighton-Rao Theorem <ref> [37] </ref>). An open question in this area is solved by the very same argument. A low-diameter decomposition of a graph G is a (not necessarily proper) coloring of the vertices with few colors, so that all monochromatic connected subgraphs have small diameters. <p> We show that this gap is bounded by the least distortion with which a certain metric associated with the network can be embedded in l 1 . This fact yields a unified approach to Leighton-Rao's <ref> [37] </ref>, and the subsequent [35], [24], and [53]. The result for non-unit demands is new. <p> The metric space of such a graph cannot be embedded with constant distortion in any normed space of dimension o (log 2 n). Proof: As observed in <ref> [37] </ref> the max-flow min-cut gap is (log n) for the all-pairs, unit-demand flow problem on a constant-degree expander, where all capacities are one. Consider the corresponding expression = P P for certain metrics d. When d is the expander's own metric = fi ( 1 n log n ).

Reference-contexts: An open question in this area is solved by the very same argument. A low-diameter decomposition of a graph G is a (not necessarily proper) coloring of the vertices with few colors, so that all monochromatic connected subgraphs have small diameters. In <ref> [43] </ref> the precise tradeoff between the number of colors and the diameter was found for general graphs. In particular, both parameters can be made logarithmic in the order of the graph, which is, in general, essentially tight. <p> The combination of these two approaches is discussed in [46]. We now turn to problems where graph metrics have a role. A low-diameter decomposition of a graph (see <ref> [43] </ref>, [7], [16]) is a (not necessarily proper) coloring of the vertices with k colors, so that every connected monochromatic subgraph has diameter D.

A low-diameter decomposition of a graph (see <ref> [43] </ref>, [7], [16]) is a (not necessarily proper) coloring of the vertices with k colors, so that every connected monochromatic subgraph has diameter D. In [43] it is shown that an n-vertex graph has such a decomposition whenever k D &gt; n and D k &gt; n, the conditions being essentially tight. The first condition is necessary, e.g., in decomposing triangulations of Euclidean spaces. The second condition is necessary for expander graphs. <p> The vertices of any d-dimensional graph can be (d + 1)-colored so that each monochromatic connected component has diameter 2d 2 (compare with <ref> [43] </ref>). They can also be covered by "patches" so that each r-sphere (r any positive integer) in the graph is contained in at least one patch, while no vertex is covered more than d + 1 times. The diameter of each such patch is (6d + 2)dr (compare with [7]). <p> It is not difficult to see that for G that is a product of d paths of length n 1 1 d , the theorem is essentially tight. 7 Low-diameter decompositions of graphs Following <ref> [43] </ref> a decomposition of a graph G = (V; E) is a partition of the vertex set into subsets (called blocks). <p> Remark 7.2: Combined with Theorem 3.2 we obtain a decomposition to O (log n) blocks of diameter O (log 3 n), and a covering of diameter O (log 3 n) with degree O (log n), results slightly inferior to the optimal (O (log n); O (log n)) from <ref> [43] </ref> and [7]. Proof: We prove the case c = 1, the general case then follows easily. Throughout the proof we use l 1 norm. <p> This follows, e.g., from Lemma 3.4 in <ref> [43] </ref>. We next show that for any cover fT i g d i=0 as above, there are two sets in the same family whose distance does not exceed O ( log d d ). Indeed, there must be a T i with upper density at least 1 d+1 .

Reference-contexts: The dimension is reduced to O (log n) by applying Theorem 3.1. To prove Claim 3, use Claim 2 and recall that for any m, l m 2 may be embedded in l 2m p , for every 1 p 2, with constant distortion (see <ref> [52] </ref>, chapter 6). This embedding may be found in random polynomial-time. <p> into l p for 2 p 1, because in this range, every finite dimensional l p space can be embedded in l 1 with a constant distortion (<ref> [52] </ref>, chapter 6). Every d-dimensional norm may be approximated with distortion p d by an affine image of the Eu clidean norm (e.g., [52]). Therefore, an embedding of constant distortion into any o (log 2 n)-dimensional normed space translates into an o (log n)-distortion embedding into l 2 , which is impossible. <p> Then we show that on a random choice of H 1 , and H 2 = H 1 , the expected number of points in V which are "far" from the origin and fall in the slab is small. It is a well known fact (e.g., <ref> [52] </ref>) that every d-dimensional norm may be approximated with distortion p d by an affine image of the Euclidean norm. <p> We need a small distortion approximation of B (or a linear transformation thereof) by a cube. Distortion d is attainable: first approximate B by a Euclidean unit ball (actually, by its Lowner-John ellipsoid, see <ref> [52] </ref>), then approximate the unit ball by a unit cube, both distortions being p d. <p> Also T i has upper density at least 1 d+1 in R d , and therefore also in K fl = [(K ff + mB). By the Brunn-Minkowski inequality (see <ref> [52] </ref>): vol (K ff ) (vol (K ff ) 1=d + vol (mB) 1=d ) d = vol (K ff ) : We used the fact that in any norm vol (B) vol (K) whenever diam (K) 2, which can be shown as follows: Consider the symmetrization Q = (K K)=2

This approach, initiated in [45], has recently found further interesting algorithmic applications (see [26] and [33]).

Reference-contexts: It also deals with 3-dimensional embeddings of a graph, mostly in the context of knot theory. (See Welsh's book [61] for some of these developments.) Particularly fascinating is the way in which geometric/topological considerations come up in the theory of forbidden minors <ref> [56] </ref>. The double cycle cover conjecture (surveyed in [30]) says that in every bridgeless graph there is a collection of cycles which cover every edge exactly twice.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, an embedding of constant distortion into any o (log 2 n)-dimensional normed space translates into an o (log n)-distortion embedding into l 2 , which is impossible. Two commodities That max-flow=min-cut for two commodities ([29] and <ref> [57] </ref>) can be shown as follows: Let d be the metric for which = P P k : Map every vertex x to the point (d x;s 1 ; d x;s 2 ) and let D be the l 1 metric among these points.

Reference-contexts: Low-dimensional models for finite metric spaces have previously been studied mostly by functional analysts (see [5], [9], [12], [19], [28], [31], [32], and [48]). Study of graph metrics has also led to the notion of spanners (see [2], [51], and <ref> [58] </ref>) and hop-sets [15]. Local-global considerations, which are 3 commonplace in geometry, arose for graphs as well (see [39] and the references therein, [42], and the recent [54]).

Reference-contexts: Particularly relevant are notions of dimension that emerge from such considerations, see, e.g., chapter 5 in [8]. The possibility of embedding graphs in spaces other than Euclidean and spheric geometry is very appealing, and hardly anything has been done in this direction (but see <ref> [59] </ref>). We have also said nothing about modeling geometric objects with graphs, which is a related vast area.

Reference-contexts: In an adjacency model, the geometry respects only the relation of adjacency/nonadjacency of vertices, but not necessarily the actual distance. A prime example for this approach is the Koebe-Andreev-Thurston Theorem (see [36], [3], [4], and <ref> [60] </ref>) that every planar graph is the contact graph of openly disjoint planar discs. Higher-dimensional results in the same vein appear in [21], [22], [49], and [55].

Reference-contexts: The topological approach is mainly concerned with graph planarity and embeddability of graphs on other 2-dimensional manifolds (see [34] for a recent survey). It also deals with 3-dimensional embeddings of a graph, mostly in the context of knot theory. (See Welsh's book <ref> [61] </ref> for some of these developments.) Particularly fascinating is the way in which geometric/topological considerations come up in the theory of forbidden minors [56].

Reference-contexts: All the referenced work notwithstanding, this short discussion leaves out large amounts of relevant work, for example, on embedding graphs in particular families of graphs such as d-dimensional lattices, cubes, squashed cubes etc. (see [27], <ref> [62] </ref>). Particularly relevant are notions of dimension that emerge from such considerations, see, e.g., chapter 5 in [8]. The possibility of embedding graphs in spaces other than Euclidean and spheric geometry is very appealing, and hardly anything has been done in this direction (but see [59]).

Reference-contexts: We show later some examples of graphs with isometric dimension n 2 . The highest isometric dimension among n-vertex graphs is currently unknown (but see [9] and <ref> [63] </ref>). The l 1 norm is universal in that, as Lemma 5.1 shows, it realizes all graphs (in fact, all finite metric spaces).

Reference-contexts: What we need is to construct H 1 and H 2 , so that, jSj = O (c d n 1 1 and 1 + o (1) n: The proof uses a beautiful idea from [50] which starts from the following well known consequence of Helly's Theorem <ref> [64] </ref>: Proposition 6.2: For any set V of n points in R d there exists a centroid O such that every closed halfspace determined by a hyperplane passing through O contains at least n d+1 points of V . By translation, O may be assumed to be the origin.
