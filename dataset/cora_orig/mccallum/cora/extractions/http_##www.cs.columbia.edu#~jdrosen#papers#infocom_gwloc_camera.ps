Title: Internet Telephony Gateway Location  
Author: Jonathan Rosenberg Henning Schulzrinne 
Affiliation: Bell Laboratories Columbia University  
Abstract: Although the Internet was designed to handle non-real time data traffic, it is being used increasingly to carry voice and video. One important class of contributors to this growth are Internet telephones. Critical to more widespread use of Internet telephony is smooth interoperability with the existing telephone network. This interoperability comes through the use of Internet Telephony Gateway's (ITG's) which perform protocol translation between an IP network and the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). In order for an IP host to call a user on the PSTN, the IP host must know the IP address of an appropriate gateway. We consider here the problem of finding these gateways. An analysis of a number of protocol architectures is presented, including hierarchical databases, multicast advertisement, routing protocols, and centralized databases. We propose a new protocol architecture, called Brokered Multicast Advertisements (BMA) which serves as a lightweight, scalable mechanism for locating ITG's. The BMA architecure is general, and can be applied to location of any service across a wide area network.

Reference-contexts: There are dozens of different applications available, many of which are free (vat [1], Nevot [2], and rat [3], for example). Besides reducing cost, Internet telephony can bring a host of new features and capabilities to this traditional medium <ref> [4] </ref>: better user interfaces, high quality speech, integration with other tools (like web browsers and appointment books), personal mobility, and a wide assortment of supplementary services, to name a few. Despite these advantages, there are a number of barriers to more widespread use of Internet telephony.

Reference-contexts: IP end-systems must be able to locate a DNS server, for example. This is typically done through either a static configuration, or via protocols like DHCP <ref> [14] </ref>. Unfortunately, ITG's provide a much different service than a DNS server. The nature of this service makes their location a much harder problem. First and foremeost, it is sufficient for an IP host to use the DNS server which is closest to it, in terms of IP hops.

Reference-contexts: In an international calling environment, the set of protocols and billing mechanisms supported by ITG's can be expected to vary. Some ITG's may support billing of IP hosts via credit cards or e-cash <ref> [15] </ref> on a per-usage basis. Others may require the IP hosts to have set up an account ahead of time. The ITG's will have to perform speech transcoding to convert the codec used by the IP host to either G.711 [16] (the standard used in the PSTN), or analog.

Since all ITG will not support all codecs, and since IP hosts may not all implement the same baseline codec, an IP host may need to select an ITG based on its speech coder support.

Reference-contexts: In addition to the speech coder, IP hosts may utilize a range of different signalling mechanisms for initiating and terminating calls, among other actions. ITG's must be able to recognize these protocols. H.323 <ref> [21] </ref> is gaining momentum as a popular standard for IP telephony. However, it is quite complicated, and other, more lightweight protocols exist. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [22] is an example of another signalling protocol for Internet telephony which is gaining acceptance.

Reference-contexts: As of August 1, 1997, America Online had approximately 1300 POPs in the U.S. (with 145 in California alone). To extrapolate to the number of POPs required worldwide, we multiply this figure by the ratio of worldwide to U.S. telephone access lines. There are 745 million telephone lines worldwide <ref> [24] </ref>, so the number of worldwide POPS would be 6330. If we assume that there 2 to 3 major service providers in each POP, there could be as many as 18,000 ITG's worldwide.

Reference-contexts: Database entries are populated by unicast ITG registrations (push). The second, web search engines, use centralized databases as well, but they are populated by periodic polling of ITGs (pull). 5.1.1 Service Location Protocol The service location protocol is under development in the srvloc working group of the IETF <ref> [25] </ref>. It allows for clients (called user agents) to find the location of a server providing a specific service in the clients administrative domain. This is accomplished in one of two ways. First, a client can broadcast a request for a service to a well-known multicast address.

Reference-contexts: This approach is more reasonable on a wide area Internet. However, these advertisements are periodically retransmitted every three hours. With fixed soft-state refresh intervals, the bandwidth used grows linearly with the number of DA's present in the network <ref> [26] </ref>. Combined with the registration traffic, this causes a lot of control overhead. Because of these problems, the Service Location Protocol has good bandwidth efficiency on a small scale, but does not scale well to the wide area Internet. It does have advantages, however.

Reference-contexts: Client complexity is very low, as is ITG complexity.

This is accomplished by having an ITG publish information about the service provided (such as protocols and cost) on the web, and allowing various search engines to collect and catalog the information.

Reference-contexts: This relieves some of the network congestion and DNS processing requirements. It is also possible for DNS records to contain more than just the IP address of the ITG. In fact, resource records which can contain the kitchen sink including MIME data, ASN.1 data, and ASCII, are being defined <ref> [32] </ref>. These records can be used to contain compact descriptions of the protocol support, capabilities, and cost structure of the ITG.

Reference-contexts: The lack of authentication in the DNS update protocol makes this concern even greater. In fact, DNS servers have recently been the subject of attacks which have attempted to change the name to IP address mappings for business gain <ref> [33] </ref>. Population of the DNS records can take place in one of two ways. ITG's can be manually entered into the database by administrators. Alternatively, protocols exist which can allow ITG's to update the DNS records themselves as they change [34][35].

Reference-contexts: On either large or small scale, DNS is not very efficient at finding the closest gateway to a host, and has security drawbacks. It is extremely simple for clients and ITG's alike, as it is based on existing and well understood standards. 5.2.2 LDAP and X.500 LDAP <ref> [36] </ref> is the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, which is used to query databases. X.500 [37] is a large, distributed database which can be used to store information about nearly anything.

Reference-contexts: Such client-side hints are not supported in LDAP.

LDAP is also fairly complex. Architecturally, an LDAP database suffers the same problem as a DNS server. A client would have to perform the same kind of longest prefix match searches as in DNS.

LDAP is also fairly complex. Architecturally, an LDAP database suffers the same problem as a DNS server. A client would have to perform the same kind of longest prefix match searches as in DNS.

Reference-contexts: This entails the same traffic and processing loads as discussed above for DNS. Unlike DNS, however, the absense of caching will amplify these problems substantially. The whois++ protocol <ref> [43] </ref> is another database query protocol, similar to LDAP. Unlike LDAP, it does not require a hierarchically organized database. Database entries are indexed, creating centroids which represent the union of the values for all attributes for all entries.

Reference-contexts: This allows for more flexibility in the organization of the database servers, but at the expense of increased network traffic to process a query. 5.3 Multicast Advertisements SAP The Session Announcement Protocol (SAP) is used to advertise multicast sessions on the Mbone <ref> [44] </ref>. Clients of the protocol send announcements describing the Mbone session (time of ocur-rence, media supported, etc.) on a well known multicast address. The transmission rate of announcements is scaled back linearly with the number of other clients sending announcements.

Jacobson, RTP: </author> <title> a transport protocol for real-time applications, Request for Comments (Proposed Standard) 1889, </title> <institution> Internet Engineering Task Force, </institution> <month> Jan. </month> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: This allows for rapid refresh of announcements when the client population is small, and bounded bandwidth utilization when it is large. This approach is also used to control RTCP packet transmission rates in RTP <ref> [45] </ref>. This basic mechanism can be extended to ITG location trivially. Instead of advertising Mbone sessions, ITG's advertise the details of the service they provide. IP hosts who wish to make a call to a PSTN destination join the multicast group and collect announcements. <p> Bandwidth usage can be further reduced by increasing this nominal period for advertisements which have already been transmitted before. Randomization of the period is also required to avoid synchronization effects [49]. This approach is a variation on the control mechanisms used in RTP <ref> [45] </ref>. It maintains the cap at R bits per second, but allows lower transmission rates when the advertisements contain no new data. As a further enhancement to improve scalability, timer reconsideration should be used [50].

Reference-contexts: Scalability and wide area operating are a must. Existing wide area routing protocols provide this kind of function. In this section, we briefly focus on how BGP <ref> [46] </ref> might be used for telephony gateway location. Each ITG acts as a BGP router.It can either run IBGP between itself and the regular EBGP routers for the autonomous system, or use an interior gateway protocol,such as OSPF [47] to distribute its routes.

BGP also allows routes to be propagated with attribute tags.

As a further enhancement to improve scalability, timer reconsideration should be used <ref> [50] </ref>. This algorithm requires end-systems to recheck the validity of their event timers before sending a packet. The validity is based on whether the perceived multicast group size (L) has changed since the timer was set.

Reference-contexts: We conclude that BMA is the most effective solution for gateway location, but that DNS can be made to work quite well for smaller number of ITG's. The BMA architecture is being proposed as an extension to the current Service Location Protocol <ref> [51] </ref>. Although designed for ITG location, BMA is well suited to location of a wide range of services, of which ITG's are just an example. 9 Acknowledgements The authors would like to Santosh Krishnan, T.V.
