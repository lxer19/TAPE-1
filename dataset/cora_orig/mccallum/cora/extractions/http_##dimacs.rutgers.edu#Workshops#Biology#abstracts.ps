Abstract: these methods. Currently, the methods which have been shown to be consistent are implemented by exhaustive search through the space of all tree topologies, and hence such methods even if accurate on a given input are computationally infeasible except on very small data sets. In a recent paper, Farach and Kannan gave a polynomial time algorithm which, with high probability, would return a tree and mutation probabilities on the edges such that the distance (under a metric they define) between the tree they obtain and the The topology of the model tree indicates the pattern of the evolutionary events, and thus is significant biologically. In this paper we present a polynomial time method which will obtain, with high probability, the topology of the model tree provided that the mutation probabilities lie in a range that depends upon the sequence length. The main theorem we obtain is: Theorem: Under certain conditions on the edge mutation probabilities, we can with probability 1 * obtain the topology of the model tree that generated a set of n binary sequences of length k in O(n 4 ff(n 4 ) + nk) time, and k may grow sublinearly as a function of n.
