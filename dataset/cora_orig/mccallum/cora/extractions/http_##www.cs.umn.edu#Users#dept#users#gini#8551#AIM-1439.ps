Abstract: We describe a project to capitalize on newly available levels of computational resources in order to understand human cognition. We will build an integrated physical system including vision, sound input and output, and dextrous manipulation, all controlled by a continuously operating large scale parallel MIMD computer. The resulting system will learn to "think" by building on its bodily experiences to accomplish progressively more abstract tasks. Past experience suggests that in attempting to build such an integrated system we will have to fundamentally change the way artificial intelligence, cognitive science, linguistics, and philosophy think about the organization of intelligence. We expect to be able to better reconcile the theories that will be developed with current work in neuroscience. This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Support for the laboratory's artificial intelligence research is provided in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense under Office of Naval Research contract N00014-91-J-4038. Support for this research was also provided by the Matsushita Corporation of Japan, the General Electric Faculty for the Future Award, and the Class of 1957 Career Development Chair.

Reference-contexts: In the following subsections we outline the constraints and requirements on a full scale humanoid body and also include where relevant details of our zero-th level prototype. 5.2.1 Eyes There has been quite a lot of recent work on animate vision using saccading stereo cameras, most notably at Rochester <ref> (Ballard 1989) </ref>, (Coombs 1992), but also more recently at many other institutions, such as Oxford University. The humanoid needs a head with high mechanical performance eyeballs and foveated vision if it is to be able to participate in the world with people in a natural way.

Each process ran until blocked and the syntax of the language forced there to always be a blocking condition, so there was no need for pre-emptive scheduling.

Reference-contexts: Still further modularization leads to independent work on such tasks as natural language processing, planning, learning, and commonsense reasoning (e.g., Allen, Hendler & Tate (1990), Hobbs & Moore (1985) or Brachman & Levesque (1985)). We have argued <ref> (Brooks 1991a) </ref> that much of GOFAI was shaped by the technological resources available to its researchers. High performance computing and communications gives us a new opportunity to re-shape attempts at building intelligent systems. Many modern theories are at odds with GOFAI.

Reference-contexts: Linguists and psycholinguists have argued that the long-fashionable separation of language into the separate components of grammar and semantics is a fiction convenient for symbolic formulation but not useful for advancing our understanding of the real diversity of language phenomena (Langacker 1987), <ref> (Harris 1991) </ref>. Brooks (1991a) proposes that human-level intelligence can be built without a single central representation of the world. Stein (to appear) argues that all of cognition can be seen as the recapitulation|through imagination|of action in the world.

Reference-contexts: There is a grounding of motor control in the different types of interactions the agent has with the world. 5 Nor is the control of attention centralized, as illustrated by studies of unilateral neglect <ref> (Kinsbourne 1987) </ref>, but rather it is a matter of competition between brain systems. The argument is that the human brain stores things not only by category but also by modality|the `representations' are grounded in the sensory modality used to learn the information.

A major intent of our proposed work is to extend that analysis to the point of its being an implementable theory on our humanoids. Recent work in neuropsychology has produced surprising results.

Reference-contexts: Linguists and psycholinguists have argued that the long-fashionable separation of language into the separate components of grammar and semantics is a fiction convenient for symbolic formulation but not useful for advancing our understanding of the real diversity of language phenomena <ref> (Langacker 1987) </ref>, (Harris 1991). Brooks (1991a) proposes that human-level intelligence can be built without a single central representation of the world. Stein (to appear) argues that all of cognition can be seen as the recapitulation|through imagination|of action in the world.

Reference-contexts: For instance once we have some sound understanding developed, we will use models of what happens in child language development to explore ways of connecting physical actions in the world to a ground of language and the development of symbols (Bates 1979), (Bates, Bretherton & Snyder 1988), including indexical <ref> (Lempert & Kinsbourne 1985) </ref> and turn-taking behavior, interpretation of tone and facial expressions and the early use of memorized phrases.

Reference-contexts: For instance there is quite a lot known about the control of eye movements in humans (again mostly extrapolated from work with monkeys) and we will build in a vestibulo-ocular response (VOR), OKR, smooth pursuit, and saccades using the best evidence available on how this is organized in humans <ref> (Lisberger 1988) </ref>. 11 A third level of modeling or inspiration that we will use is at the developmental level.

Reference-contexts: A major intent of our proposed work is to extend that analysis to the point of its being an implementable theory on our humanoids. Recent work in neuropsychology has produced surprising results. Lesion studies, e.g. those by Damasio & Damasio (1989) and <ref> (McCarthy & Warrington 1990) </ref>, indicate that the modularity of storage and access in the human brain is dramatically different from what our intuitions|as exemplified by both cognitive science and GOFAI|tell us.

Reference-contexts: Because they are closer to actual sensation, these approaches have had marked success in certain areas (e.g., video-game playing (Agre & Chap-man 1987); navigation <ref> (Pomerleau 1991) </ref>; "insect" intelligence (Connell 1990), (Angle & Brooks 1990)). However, because they lack symbols or any comparable abstraction, these systems are often inscrutable. A corollary is the difficulty that practitioners have had in transferring knowledge gained in the construction of one system to the design of the next.

Reference-contexts: This is the trick of consciousness: the idea that "we" exist, that one part of us is observing another. Although there is good evidence that consciousness is anything but a simple phenomenon (i.e., that the reality 4 is far more complex than our post hoc reconstruction of it) <ref> (Springer & Deutsch 1981) </ref>, it almost certainly does have some of the properties that we attribute to it. With language, symbols become more than merely a post hoc explanation by others of the workings of our own brains; symbols become our own explanation to ourselves.
