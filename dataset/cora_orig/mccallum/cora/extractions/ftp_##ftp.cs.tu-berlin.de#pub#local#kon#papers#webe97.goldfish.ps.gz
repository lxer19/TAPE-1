Reference-contexts: In order to explain the results of the polarity reversal experiment, this interaction must act between fibers from different eyes and a sum over eyes has been added to eq. (5). We choose the Gaussian shape of interaction to incorporate the effect of locally adhesive markers <ref> (Bastmeyer et al. 1995) </ref>. Thereby we assume rotational and translational symmetry. On the retina, the Gaussian function could represent similarity of chemical markers between one site to its neighbors. <p> Here temporal growth cones collapse on contact with nasal fibers when they meet at a Y-shaped junction. 5. The expression of certain cell adhesion molecules like the E587 antigen has been shown to be growth-associated <ref> (Bastmeyer et al. 1995) </ref>. Thus fibers adhere and fasciculate selectively which originate from the ciliary margin of the fish retina where cells grow. 6.

Reference-contexts: More recently, some gradedly distributed markers have been found in retina and tectum like RAGS and ELF-1 ligands which decrease linearly from caudal towards rostral tectum <ref> (Drescher et al. 1995, Cheng et al. 1995) </ref> and Mek4 receptor which is distributed in the retina in a temporal to nasal gradient (Cheng et al. 1995). <p> More recently, some gradedly distributed markers have been found in retina and tectum like RAGS and ELF-1 ligands which decrease linearly from caudal towards rostral tectum (Drescher et al. 1995, Cheng et al. 1995) and Mek4 receptor which is distributed in the retina in a temporal to nasal gradient <ref> (Cheng et al. 1995) </ref>. A protein with a step-function like distribution has not been proved, but the TRAP protein shows to be preferentially distributed on the temporal retina possibly in a step-like distribution (McLoon 1991). <p> Evidence for similar markers has recently been found in the retinotectal system.

The prevailing view is that pre- and postsynaptic cells connect when simultaneously active. Due to correlated activity in the retina as is usually assumed this Hebbian-type mechanism (Hebb 1949) bundles retinal fibers from nearby retinal sites within the corresponding eye and thus assists topography.

Reference-contexts: So far, previous approaches have not been completely satisfying. The Marker Induction (Willshaw & von der 2 Malsburg 1979) and Arrow Models (Overton & Arbib 1982), for example, postulate a fixed strength of fiber-tectum vs. fiber-fiber interactions and discard activity driven processes. The Multiple Constraint Model <ref> (Fraser & Perkel 1990) </ref> allows to fit the effect individual processes have on map-formation against the data, by changing the values of appropriate coupling constants. The model, however, makes no predictions about the time-course of development and about receptive and projective fields. <p> As this model resolutely assumes there to be no innate tectal marker it cannot explain initial generation: there must be further cues which determine the polarity of the normal projection. The Multiple Constraint Model <ref> (Fraser & Perkel 1990) </ref> for the first time combines four mechanisms, position-independent induction of growth, fiber-tectum interactions, activity dependent fiber-fiber interactions and a competition of fibers for tectal space.

Reference-contexts: When a part of the retina is removed without cutting the optic nerve, the remaining projection expands after several months (Schmidt 1978a) and remains topographic. When a part of the tectum is removed without cutting the optic nerve the projection compresses but topography is not fully restored <ref> (Gaze & Sharma 1970, Sharma 1972) </ref>. Numerical simulations correctly predict the results of the compression experiment (figure 5 (g)) including the emergence of double receptive fields as one shown in figure 9 (b) but contradict the expansion results.

Reference-contexts: We therefore expect this ansatz to be a useful tool to interpret and design new experiments not only in goldfish but in other species of current interest like the zebrafish <ref> (see Goodman & Shatz 1993 for a review) </ref>. The paper is divided into five parts. After a review of the relevant experiments and a brief discussion of previous computational approaches we describe our ansatz in section three.

Reference-contexts: Thus fibers adhere and fasciculate selectively which originate from the ciliary margin of the fish retina where cells grow. 6. Guidance molecules, e.g. netrins in rat and chick, have been found which show repellent or attractive activities on different types of fibers <ref> (see Holt & Harris 1993, for a review) </ref>. The first three experiments provide evidence for fiber-fiber interactions active after the afferents reach tectum, though in an indirect fashion. The first experiment requires this interaction for the reversal of map polarity.

Reference-contexts: In these experiments, grafts of tissue were dissected from tectum and reimplanted after they have been either rotated around the vertical axis by 90 o or 180 o , after they 3 have been inverted (Yoon 1973, 1975b) or after two of them have been exchanged <ref> (Hope et al. 1976) </ref>. In general, the optic fibers found their original sites even on the rotated or translocated grafts, except when the exchanged grafts were small and close together in which case an undisturbed topographic map was formed. <p> In general, the optic fibers found their original sites even on the rotated or translocated grafts, except when the exchanged grafts were small and close together in which case an undisturbed topographic map was formed. It was found that the displaced projection can shrink or expand towards intact areas <ref> (Hope et al. 1976) </ref>. In order to rule out a decisive influence of previous innervation graft rotation experiments have been performed, albeit in the Xenopus system, where the initial projection was either completely scrambled (Hunt 1976) or lacking (Straznicky 1978). Again, the topographic map exhibited a rotated part. <p> We will shortly describe a selection of models which are powerful in describing the retinotectal projection and / or which have contributed to our model. The (Gradient) Arrow Model <ref> (Hope et al. 1976) </ref> was designed to reformulate the chemospecificity hypothesis. Only one mechanism, the fiber-tectum interaction was implemented to give two retinal fibers information about the correctness of their relative positions on tectum and interchange them if appropriate. <p> Given biologically plausible cost-functions the model can explain expansion, compression, rotation and ocular dominance patches. Unfortunately, the authors do not point out the model's weaknesses: thus, a simulation of the translocation experiment is missing. Translocation is difficult to achieve as has been shown by the Arrow Model <ref> (Hope et al. 1976) </ref> when fibers can only make small steps. The model by Whitelaw & Cowan (1981) describes topographic map formation as the interplay between activity driven Hebbian learning modulated in a multiplicative way by a fiber-tectum interaction due to chemical markers. <p> In the 2D-case the correctly projectioning neighbors outnumber the displaced fibers of small grafts and a topographic representation slowly replaces the disturbed projection. In the case shown, as observed by <ref> (Hope 1976) </ref>, non-displaced tectal border areas are invaded by a displaced projection (figure 5 (h)). Figures 5 (c), 5 (d) and 6 (f) show the results of the expansion, compression and mismatch experiments.

Reference-contexts: When optic fibers from a whole eye are allowed to invade a half-tectum which has been denervated for 40 days (Yoon 1975a) a compressed topographic map with correct polarity is formed. In the mismatch experiment <ref> (Horder 1971) </ref> the temporal part of the retina and the caudal part of the tectum are removed such that the non-corresponding parts remain. The final projection is again topographic and polarity is preserved. <p> This experiment has to be compared with the mismatch experiment <ref> (Horder 1971) </ref> which is similar except that the posterior half-tectum is removed and thus there is no influence of normal posterior innervation. In this case a map with correct polarity was formed.

Reference-contexts: It was found that the displaced projection can shrink or expand towards intact areas (Hope et al. 1976). In order to rule out a decisive influence of previous innervation graft rotation experiments have been performed, albeit in the Xenopus system, where the initial projection was either completely scrambled <ref> (Hunt 1976) </ref> or lacking (Straznicky 1978). Again, the topographic map exhibited a rotated part. Although initial experiments supported Sperry's ideas, other experiments were performed, whose outcomes stressed plasticity, i.e. the ability to override any specific markers for the sake of an undisturbed topographic projection. <p> This is in accordance with experiments. In addition, one has to keep in mind that the translocation experiments may not have been "clean" enough to exclude effects of the previous tectal innervation. "Clean" experiments have so far only been performed for tectal graft rotation in Xenopus <ref> (Hunt 1976, Straznicky 1978) </ref>. Even with a step-function as in eq. (3), the results did not differ significantly from the results using the "double gradient" form. To preserve polarity in an experiment with only one half retina or tectum, however, the steps have to be smoothed.

Reference-contexts: A protein with a step-function like distribution has not been proved, but the TRAP protein shows to be preferentially distributed on the temporal retina possibly in a step-like distribution <ref> (McLoon 1991) </ref>. See Holt & Harris (1993) for a review. 4 What is the factor mediating plasticity? It has been proposed that electrical activity may be the factor, which underlies plasticity and which ensures topography under abnormal experimental conditions. <p> Other markers like RAGS (Drescher 1995) and Sek (Cheng et al. 1995) are further candidates for gradients along the anterior-posterior axis. A candidate for a stepfunction-like distributed marker is the Temporal Retinal Axon Protein found by McLoon <ref> (McLoon 1991) </ref>. No candidates have yet been found for a highly specific interaction similar to eq. (4). It was, however, included in some of the numerical simulations to demonstrate its impact on map-formation, because it is the most straightforward implementation of Sperry's (1943, 1963) chemospecificity hypothesis. <p> Experimental evidence is strong for graded distributions of markers because these have been discovered recently in retino-tectal systems (Drescher et al. 1995, Cheng et al. 1995), but somewhat softened stepfunctions of chemical gradients in retina <ref> (McLoon 1991) </ref> and also in tectum are also plausible. Recent findings suggest that a molecule (s) expressed by engrailed genes attracts nasal retinal axons and at the 23 same time repels the growth of temporal axons (Friedman & O'Leary 1996, Itasaki & Nakamura 1996).

Reference-contexts: When they are deflected into an intact projection they are confined to the rostral tectum, but when there is an already expanded half-retinal contralateral projection then they expand correspondingly (Schmidt 1978a). The most outstanding example for intrinsic fiber fiber interaction is the polarity reversal experiment <ref> (Meyer 1979a) </ref>. In this experiment the innervation of one anterior tectal half is permanently removed (upper right tectum in figure 1). At the same time a select fraction of ipsilateral nasal optic fibers, those which normally innervate the posterior contralateral (left) tectum are deflected into the anterior half. <p> In this case a map with correct polarity was formed. The similarity of the surgery at both experiments and the fact that deflected fibers were still oriented normally at the insertion point in the polarity reversal experiment <ref> (Meyer 1979a) </ref> rules out a decisive influence of the organization of the retinal fiber bundle. Thus the reversal of polarity in Meyer's experiment provides evidence for a highly selective interaction between fibers which originate from corresponding regions of different eyes. Table 1 summarizes experiments and putative mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: Activity dependent mechanisms can be demonstrated when fibers from both eyes are made to grow onto one tectum. Ocular dominance patches emerge <ref> (Meyer 1979b) </ref>, but their formation is suppressed, when retinal activity is blocked in both eyes (Meyer 1982). Note that the projections from two nasal half-retinae expand across the whole tectum while forming stripes (Fawcett & Willshaw 1982). The prevailing view is that pre- and postsynaptic cells connect when simultaneously active.

Reference-contexts: Due to correlated activity in the retina as is usually assumed this Hebbian-type mechanism (Hebb 1949) bundles retinal fibers from nearby retinal sites within the corresponding eye and thus assists topography. Blocking of electrical activity by TTX <ref> (Olson & Meyer 1994) </ref> as well as impeding correlated firing through stroboscopic light (Cook & Rankin 1986, Schmidt & Buzzard 1993) prevents the refinement of projective fields. Activity, however, cannot be the only mechanism mediating plasticity, because expansion, for example, occurs under TTX-blockade (Olson & Meyer 1994). <p> Blocking of electrical activity by TTX <ref> (Olson & Meyer 1994) </ref> as well as impeding correlated firing through stroboscopic light (Cook & Rankin 1986, Schmidt & Buzzard 1993) prevents the refinement of projective fields. Activity, however, cannot be the only mechanism mediating plasticity, because expansion, for example, occurs under TTX-blockade (Olson & Meyer 1994). Other experiments provide direct evidence for an interaction between retinal fibers, which is intrinsic rather than activity dependent. A repulsion of temporal retinal growth cones occurs at contact with nasal retinal axons in vitro (Raper & Grunewald 1990). <p> Unspecific growth of retinal fibers to somewhere in tectum underlies every experiment and is a fundamental assumption. The restriction to positive synaptic strengths reflects the involvement of one cell type only, namely the retinal ganglion cells. There is evidence for an approximate conservation of total synapse number <ref> (Olson & Meyer 1994) </ref>, however, the exact form of the constraint is to some extent arbitrary and has to be fitted against data.

Reference-contexts: Other experiments provide direct evidence for an interaction between retinal fibers, which is intrinsic rather than activity dependent. A repulsion of temporal retinal growth cones occurs at contact with nasal retinal axons in vitro <ref> (Raper & Grunewald 1990) </ref>. Experiments show that temporal retinal fibers are attracted to those locations in tectum which are innervated by fibers from mirror-symmetrically corresponding locations in the contralateral retina. <p> Note also, that on the retina, there is evidence for repulsive markers at mutually distant locations <ref> (Raper & Grunewald 1990) </ref>. Distant repulsive markers can in principle be modeled by a Mexican hat shaped (Difference Of Gaussians, DOG) retinal interaction function. However, we may also regard the inhibitory component of such a function to be constituted by the retinal constraint of eq. (8). <p> The enlarged receptive and projective fields measured in the experiments of Meyer (1994b) suggest larger interaction widths of this function compared to the activity-driven interaction. 4. In an in vitro assay <ref> (Raper & Grunewald 1990) </ref> nasal retinal fibers repel temporal (and thus distant) retinal fibers. Here temporal growth cones collapse on contact with nasal fibers when they meet at a Y-shaped junction. 5.

Reference-contexts: A review of experimental findings and models Experimental findings Many in vivo surgery experiments in the past have been designed to settle the question which mechanisms play the dominant role in development. An old hypothesis - called the chemoaffinity hypothesis <ref> (Sperry 1943, 1963) </ref> stated that afferent fibers specifically recognize their target location in tectum. This simple and straightforward hypothesis was supported by a set of regeneration experiments called "translocation" and "rotation".

Reference-contexts: In order to rule out a decisive influence of previous innervation graft rotation experiments have been performed, albeit in the Xenopus system, where the initial projection was either completely scrambled (Hunt 1976) or lacking <ref> (Straznicky 1978) </ref>. Again, the topographic map exhibited a rotated part. Although initial experiments supported Sperry's ideas, other experiments were performed, whose outcomes stressed plasticity, i.e. the ability to override any specific markers for the sake of an undisturbed topographic projection. Those regeneration experiments were called "compression", "expansion" and "mismatch".

Reference-contexts: Because the retina grows at the ciliary margin while tectum grows at the caudal end, development involves a continuous reorganization of the topographic map. When the optic nerve is sectioned, afferent axons develop growthcones and grow towards tectum even in adult goldfish. Axons are disordered in the optic nerve <ref> (Stuermer 1986) </ref> and compared to normal development terminal arbors refine in a more irregular fashion with multiunit receptive fields emerging temporarily (Stuermer 1988). Finally, a normal topographic projection is established, but an abnormal structure of the tectal layers may persist after some experiments (Yoon 1975b).

Reference-contexts: The goal was to (i) characterize the nature of the individual mechanisms, (ii) to understand their interaction and (iii) to serve as a guideline for further experiments. All models take into account the experimental finding that the mechanisms of regeneration try to fulfill two sometimes conflicting goals <ref> (Whitelaw & Cowan 1981) </ref> dubbed "specificity" and "plasticity". In this context, specificity refers to the high precision with which retinal fibers connect both layers and plasticity refers to the ability of the projection to adapt even to drastic experimental manipulations of retinal and tectal tissue. <p> Some of the modeling approaches are too complex, like the Friedman-Cowan approach. Other approaches are too simple, like the Multiple Constraint Model, and do not include receptive and projective fields. In the following, we will simplify and extend the Friedman-Cowan <ref> (Whitelaw & Cowan 1981, Friedman & Cowan 1990, 1991) </ref> formulation, which seems to be the most promising approach towards a coherent mathematical framework of intrinsic and activity driven development. Model and Implementation Overview The following mathematical description is based on the Whitelaw & Cowan (1981) formulation.

Rotation and translocation, however, showed disorder and double nasal expansion did not predict the ocular dominance patches seen in experiments. The Marker Induction Model <ref> (Willshaw & von der Malsburg 1979) </ref> also assumes specific chemical markers. It states that markers are not innate but are induced by retinal fibers which innervate a given tectal site and by a following diffusion process.

Reference-contexts: In these experiments, grafts of tissue were dissected from tectum and reimplanted after they have been either rotated around the vertical axis by 90 o or 180 o , after they 3 have been inverted <ref> (Yoon 1973, 1975b) </ref> or after two of them have been exchanged (Hope et al. 1976). In general, the optic fibers found their original sites even on the rotated or translocated grafts, except when the exchanged grafts were small and close together in which case an undisturbed topographic map was formed.
