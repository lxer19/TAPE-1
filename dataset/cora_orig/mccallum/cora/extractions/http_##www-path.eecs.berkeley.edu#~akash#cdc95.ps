Abstract: We present the design and verification of inter-vehicle communication protocols for degraded modes of operation on Automated Highway System (AHS). We consider various hardware and sensor faults that can develop on the automated vehicle in an AHS and design discrete event supervisory controllers to stop the faulty vehicle or take it out of the highway in a safe manner. The protocols are verified for logical correctness by using automatic formal verification tools.

Reference-contexts: A platoon is a group of tightly spaced vehicles with separations of about 1 meter and with an inter-platoon distance of about 30 meters. It has been shown that platooning results in a substantial increase in capacity and safety. However, platooning requires automatic control of vehicles. In <ref> [1] </ref> a hierarchical controller was proposed for platooning under normal conditions of operation, i.e., when environmental conditions are benign and the operation of the vehicles is faultless. The controller is hierarchically organized into four layers and is distributed between the vehicle and the roadside. <p> The coordination layer , which resides in the vehicles, is responsible for coordinating the movement of platoons with their neighbors. The regulation layer contains individual maneuver control laws that produce throttle, braking and steering inputs to the vehicle. The backbone of the hierarchical controller of <ref> [1] </ref> is the design and verification of five basic maneuvers; join, split, lane change, entry and exit [2] that form an alphabet for describing the behavior of an automated vehicle on an AHS. <p> Front Dock can be considered as a reciprocal of the normal mode merge maneuver. The maneuvers Forced Split and Emergency Lane Change are variations of the normal mode maneuvers split and lane change 2.3 Priorities and Mutual Exclusion In the normal mode architecture of <ref> [1] </ref>, each platoon can be engaged in at most one maneuver at a time. Any other request received during this time is discarded.

In this paper, we formally specify each of the new maneuvers and mathematically prove that the design is logically correct. 1.1 Problem Formulation According to the extended architecture of [3], in case of severe faults (such as steering failure) the vehicle must stop and wait to be towed while for less severe faults it may be possible for the vehicle to exit the highway on its own. In either case, special coordination and regulation layer strategies are required. <p> We refer the reader to [6] for a more thorough discussion of optimality and design tradeoffs for the extended controller. 2. Design of Coordination Protocols According to the framework of <ref> [3] </ref>, the extended coordination layer controller is divided into two levels (Figure 1): a strategic planning level called coordination supervisor and an execution level called coordination maneuver . Once a fault is detected the capability and performance monitors of [3] uniquely classify it into one of the fault classes. <p> Design of Coordination Protocols According to the framework of <ref> [3] </ref>, the extended coordination layer controller is divided into two levels (Figure 1): a strategic planning level called coordination supervisor and an execution level called coordination maneuver . Once a fault is detected the capability and performance monitors of [3] uniquely classify it into one of the fault classes. Depending on the class or subclass the fault belongs to, the coordination supervisor selects an appropriate strategy. The control strategies are executed by following a sequence of maneuvers. <p> We now describe these coordination layer controllers briefly. Refer to [7] for a detailed description along with the corresponding FSM diagrams. 2.1 Compound Maneuvers For the most severe faults, the corresponding strategies must stop the vehicle on the highway. Three strategies are defined for this purpose in <ref> [3] </ref>, namely, Gentle Stop (GS), Crash Stop (CS), and Aided Stop (AS). If the faulty vehicle has lost its braking capability, then it uses Aided Stop strategy in which the vehicle in front of the faulty vehicle applies gentle braking to bring both the vehicles to stop. <p> For the less severe faults, corresponding coordination layer strategies are designed to rely on cooperation from the neighbors to get the faulty vehicle out of the highway, without stopping the traffic. Three such strategies are defined in <ref> [3] </ref>, namely, Take Immediate Exit (TIE), Take Immediate Exit Escorted (TIE-E) and Take Immediate Exit Normal (TIE-N). The TIE strategy consists of up to two Forced Split (FS) maneuvers to become a free agent. <p> Making use of the classification scheme of <ref> [3] </ref>, the faults and the degraded mode strategies are assigned priorities in [7]. If two fault neighborhoods intersect, the maneuver corresponding to the lower priority fault is preempted.

Reference-contexts: Recall that the goal of the design is to maintain safe operation while minimizing the impact of faults on the highway throughput. A safety requirement can be formalized using the following definitions, proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>: Definition 1 A Catastrophe is a high speed inter-vehicle collision. A possible catastrophe is a situation that can give rise to a high speed collision without an additional fault developing in the system. <p> A possible catastrophe is a situation that can give rise to a high speed collision without an additional fault developing in the system. Definition 2 A Hazard is a situation in which one additional fault leads to a possible catastrophe. The following safety specification was proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>: Definition 3 The AHS is safe if a hazard does not arise without two simultaneous faults of system components in a small neighborhood in space and time. Our analysis indicates that this safety criterion is too demanding for any design to satisfy. <p> We formally verified that under certain assumptions on environment, regulation and physical layer responses, our design does not deadlock and either brings the faulty vehicle to a stop or takes it to the exit safely. We showed that the original safety specification proposed in <ref> [4] </ref>, that up to three faults in a neighborhood do not lead to a catastrophe, cannot be met and proposed a refinement of this specification. We also propose to implement our scheme on the highway simulator SmartPath [9] to gain confidence in the modeling, design, and verification.

Reference-contexts: The verification would be complete if we can show that this finite state description is indeed an abstraction of the continuous behavior. However, this task is not trivial, as indicated by the results in <ref> [5] </ref>. It still remains to be proved that our design is optimal from the throughput perspective.

Reference-contexts: The increased complexity of the design also gives rise to increased complexity of verification of the safety of the overall hybrid system. We refer the reader to <ref> [6] </ref> for a more thorough discussion of optimality and design tradeoffs for the extended controller. 2.

Reference-contexts: The individual maneuvers at the coordination layer are called atomic maneuvers and the coordination strategies are called compound maneuvers. The maneuver protocols are modeled using finite state machines (FSM) that unambiguously define the strategies and maneuvers. We now describe these coordination layer controllers briefly. Refer to <ref> [7] </ref> for a detailed description along with the corresponding FSM diagrams. 2.1 Compound Maneuvers For the most severe faults, the corresponding strategies must stop the vehicle on the highway. Three strategies are defined for this purpose in [3], namely, Gentle Stop (GS), Crash Stop (CS), and Aided Stop (AS). <p> Concatenation allows us to build and verify compound maneuvers by executing the verified atomic maneuvers in a predetermined sequence. The informal FSM's of <ref> [7] </ref> are converted into COSPAN [8] specification along with the FSM model of the continuous dynamics and the environment to get a closed system. 3.2.1 Verification Results The design was specified in COSPAN and verified by using a set of monitors. <p> In testing the higher level supervisors: SUPR-TIE, SUPR-TIE-E, and SUPR-TIE-N, we used a monitor FSM to check that concatenations of the atomic maneuvers occur based on valid e-transformations of their grid snapshots. The complete COSPAN code for all the FSM can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>. COSPAN output for all the maneuvers and statistical results are also included. 3.3 Multiple Faults The definitions of neighborhood, assisting and isolating vehicles used in the above verification are intuitive and unambiguous in the case of one faulty vehicle on the entire highway. <p> Making use of the classification scheme of [3], the faults and the degraded mode strategies are assigned priorities in <ref> [7] </ref>. If two fault neighborhoods intersect, the maneuver corresponding to the lower priority fault is preempted. If two strategies have the same priority and their protocol neighborhoods intersect, then the strategy that gets initialized later must wait until the first strategy is complete. In [7], we have also defined a tower <p> mode strategies are assigned priorities in <ref> [7] </ref>. If two fault neighborhoods intersect, the maneuver corresponding to the lower priority fault is preempted. If two strategies have the same priority and their protocol neighborhoods intersect, then the strategy that gets initialized later must wait until the first strategy is complete. In [7], we have also defined a tower of successive strategies that a faulty vehicle will choose if its current strategy gets aborted. In the worst case, if none of the neighbors are available for help, the faulty vehicle stops on the highway. <p> In the worst case, if none of the neighbors are available for help, the faulty vehicle stops on the highway. Claim 3 For an arbitrary collection of faults f j the degraded mode protocols will not deadlock Proof: Refer to <ref> [7] </ref> for details. The above claim says nothing about the safety of the design. In fact not only is there no guarantee that the vehicles will not crash, but there may even be situations when it is impossible even to find a feasible action.
