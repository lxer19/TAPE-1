Reference-contexts: A third observation is the lack of success achieved by orthogonal-edge drawings and three-dimensional drawings. In the former case, this year's results may be anomalous: in the two previous contests, orthogonal-edge drawings have figured prominently among the prize winners <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. However, no three-dimensional drawing has ever been awarded a prize in any of the three contests to date (we are not counting the special honorable mention given to a three-dimensional drawing of this year's Graph A see above).
