Abstract: This paper presents a data compaction/randomization based approach as a mode of block encryption for ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) cells. The presented approach converts a plaintext into pseudo-random plaintext before ciphering to conceal patterns in the plain-text. The underlying idea behind this scheme is the Shannon's principles of "confusion" and "diffusion" which involve breaking dependencies and introducing as much randomness as possible into the ciphertext. In this scheme, confusion and diffusion are introduced into the system by first compressing the ATM cell payload and then spreading a continuously changing random data over the entire content of the cell. As a mode of operation for block ciphering, this scheme offers the following attractive features: (i) plaintext patterns are pseudo-randomized and chained with ciphertext (thereby, preventing against "dictionary", "known plaintext", and "statistical analysis" attacks), (ii) it is self-synchronizing, (iii) cell loss has no additional negative effect, (iv) no IV (Initialization Vector) storage is required, (v) it is encryption-algorithm independent, (vi) there is no cell-to-cell dependency (no feedback from previous cells), and (vii) it is highly scalable (i.e., cells from the same stream can be ciphered and deciphered in parallel). This paper also presents a secure mechanism for in-band synchronization of encryption/decryption key updates using a "marker-cell" that is carried within the data channel. An important aspect of both the above mechanisms is that they do not require any changes to the ATM cell header or ATM infrastructure.

As DES is a 64-bit block encryption algorithm with a symmetric secret key, for some applications it is not secure enough to encrypt each block of plaintext into a block of ciphertext.

Reference-contexts: The intruder can make intelligent guesses about the plaintext to carry out dictionary attack, known plaintext attack, and traffic analysis attack. Although deducing the cipher key is computationally hard <ref> [9] </ref>, it is possible to read the plaintext by skipping the search for the key and simply mapping the encoded characters back into plaintext. Note that this exposed security risk is further increased for low data-content cells such as those carrying Telnet traffic.

Reference-contexts: To overcome the heightened security exposure, some form of feedback mechanism can be used in the encryption process. Several feedback mechanisms, or modes of operation, exist. Some examples are: cipher block chaining (CBC) <ref> [24] </ref>, cipher feedback (CFB), output feedback (OFB) and Counter modes. In these modes of operation, typically the result of encryption of a 64-bit block is propagated through the encryption of subsequent blocks.
