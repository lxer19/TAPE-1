Abstract: This article is concerned with the dynamical properties of solutions of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations of supercon-ductivity. It is shown that the TDGL equations define a dynamical process when the applied magnetic field varies with time and a dynamical system when the applied magnetic field is stationary. In the latter case, every solution of the TDGL equations is attracted to a set of stationary solutions, which are divergence free. These results are obtained in the "OE = !(rA)" gauge with ! &gt; 0, which generalizes the standard "OE = r A" gauge. The implications for the limiting case ! = 0 (zero-electric potential gauge) are discussed.

Reference-contexts: We show that the TDGL equations define a dynamical process when the applied magnetic field varies with time and a dynamical system when the applied magnetic field is stationary. We work consistently in the "OE = !(r A)" gauge introduced in <ref> [1] </ref> and [2] and deduce by logical arguments the ramifications for the zero-electric potential gauge (OE = 0). <p> As first noted by Tak a c [2], the TDGL equations generate a dynamical system in this gauge, and every stationary solution satisfies the London gauge. 4 In this article, we use a generalization of the "OE = r A" gauge, which was introduced by Fleckinger-Pell e and Kaper in <ref> [1] </ref>. The "OE = !(r A)" gauge, where ! is any nonnegative number, generalizes the standard "OE = r A" gauge and reduces to the zero-electric potential gauge (OE = 0) in the limit ! = 0. <p> For the present investigation we adopt the "OE = !(rA)" 7 gauge, where ! is a real nonnegative parameter. This gauge, introduced in <ref> [1] </ref>, is determined by taking O j O ! (x; t) as the (unique) solution of the boundary-value problem (@ t !)O = OE + !(r A) in fi (0; 1); (2.11) subject to a suitable initial condition, O ( ; 0) = O 0 in . (See the remark following

We work consistently in the "OE = !(r A)" gauge introduced in [1] and <ref> [2] </ref> and deduce by logical arguments the ramifications for the zero-electric potential gauge (OE = 0). <p> Although it is true, as our work will show, that the London gauge is the appropriate gauge for the time-independent GL equations, the "OE = r A" gauge is a natural gauge for the TDGL equations. As first noted by Tak a c <ref> [2] </ref>, the TDGL equations generate a dynamical system in this gauge, and every stationary solution satisfies the London gauge. 4 In this article, we use a generalization of the "OE = r A" gauge, which was introduced by Fleckinger-Pell e and Kaper in [1]. <p> The zero-electric potential gauge, which is the preferred choice for numerical calculations, yields a form of the TDGL equations that does not fit the framework of the Navier-Stokes equations and is not covered by the analysis of Ref. [19]. Applying the methods developed by Tak a c in <ref> [2] </ref>, we establish rigorously the existence of a dynamical process for the TDGL equations in the case where the applied magnetic field is time dependent and the existence of a dynamical system in the case where it is time independent.

Obviously, function spaces of ordered pairs ( ; A), where : ! R 2 and A : !
