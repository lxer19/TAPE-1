Abstract: We consider the size of circuits which perfectly hash an arbitrary subset S f0; 1g n of cardinality 2 k into f0; 1g m . We observe that, in general, the size of such circuits is exponential in 2k m, and provide a matching upper bound. Note: In contrast to our previous impression, the lower bound has been known; see analogous argument in [6, pp. 128-129].

Reference-contexts: Here we use a family of n-wise independent functions mapping f0; 1g n onto f0; 1g ` , where ` def = m log 2 n. Function in such a family can be evaluated by poly (n)-size circuits; cf., <ref> [1] </ref>. We consider the collisions caused by a uniformly chosen function from this family applied to S.

Reference-contexts: For every S f0; 1g n , there is a circuit of size poly (n) which perfectly hashes S into f0; 1g 2dlog 2 jSje . (The circuit implements a suitable function from a family of Universal 2 Hashing <ref> [2] </ref>. Such a family always contains perfect hashing functions for S [4].) We show that these bounds are the best possible.

Reference-contexts: Such a family always contains perfect hashing functions for S <ref> [4] </ref>.) We show that these bounds are the best possible. That is Theorem 1 For every n; k and m n 1, there exists a subset S f0; 1g n of cardinality 2 k which cannot be hashed into f0; 1g m using a circuit of size (2 2km =n). <p> The lemma follows. Using Lemma 2.1, we are now ready to present a circuit which perfectly hashes an arbitrary 2 k - subset, S f0; 1g n , into f0; 1g m . Our construction uses the double hashing paradigm (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>). Let h : f0; 1g n 7! f0; 1g klog 2 n be as guaranteed by the lemma.
