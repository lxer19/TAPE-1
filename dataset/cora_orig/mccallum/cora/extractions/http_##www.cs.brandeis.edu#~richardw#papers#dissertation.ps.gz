Reference-contexts: The idea of competition, as it has been conceived by ecologists, is unrealistic when tested against what really happens in natural populations and communities. <ref> [Andrewartha and Birch, 1984] </ref>, p131. The assumption that competition is the primary force in evolution is sometimes ill-founded.

Reference-contexts: Comparing natural evolution and Genetic Algorithms 1. 2. 1. The standard Genetic Algorithm, and terminology The basic principle of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is to apply a selection pressure to a gradually varying population <ref> [Goldberg, DE, 1989] </ref>. The standard GA uses a string of characters (typically binary bits) to represent the genome of each individual in a population. Random genomes are generated for the initial population. The process progresses by repeatedly selecting individuals as parents and producing offspring.

Reference-contexts: The success of a species is measured Richard Watson KBS MSc Dissertation July 1996 Page 7 of 34 according to its behaviour with respect to another evolving species hence coevolution, (for example, [Hillis 1990], [Harvey, Husbands & Cliff 1994], [Sims 1995], [Batali & Kitcher 1995], and <ref> [Oliphant, M, 1995] </ref>). However, the researcher is still left with the task of designing the encoding schema [Cliff & Mataric, 1996].
