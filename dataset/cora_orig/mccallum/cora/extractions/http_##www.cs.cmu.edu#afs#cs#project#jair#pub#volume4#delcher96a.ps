Abstract: Traditional databases commonly support efficient query and update procedures that operate in time which is sublinear in the size of the database. Our goal in this paper is to take a first step toward dynamic reasoning in probabilistic databases with comparable efficiency. We propose a dynamic data structure that supports efficient algorithms for updating and querying singly connected Bayesian networks. In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in time O(1) and queries are processed in time O(N ), where N is the size of the network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us to answer queries in time O(log N ) at the expense of O(log N ) time per evidence absorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in applications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic databases. We briefly discuss a potential application of dynamic probabilistic reasoning in computational biology.

Reference-contexts: Probabilistic trees have been used in computer vision (Hel-Or & Werman, 1992; Chelberg, 1990), signal processing (Wilsky, 1993), game playing (Delcher & Kasif, 1992), and statistical mechanics <ref> (Berger & Ye, 1990) </ref>. Nevertheless, causal trees are fairly limited for modeling purposes. However similar structures, called join trees, arise in the course of one of the standard algorithms for computing with arbitrary Bayesian networks (see Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988).

Reference-contexts: We are currently experimenting with our approach with singly connected networks (polytrees). It is likely to be more difficult to generalize the techniques to general networks. Since it is known that the general problem of inference in probabilistic networks is NP-hard <ref> (Cooper, 1990) </ref>, it obviously is not possible to obtain polynomial-time incremental 56 Queries & Updates in Probabilistic Networks solutions of the type discussed in this paper for general probabilistic networks.

Reference-contexts: matrices. 39 Delcher, Grove, Kasif & Pearl Y Z @ @R V X @ @ @R U Finally, we discuss a specific modelling application in computational biology where probabilistic models are used to describe, analyze and predict the functional behavior of biological sequences such as protein chains or DNA sequences <ref> (see Delcher, Kasif, Goldberg, and Hsu, 1993 for references) </ref>. Much of the information in computational biology databases is noisy. However, a number of successful attempts to build probabilistic models have been made. <p> This implies that if the tree is balanced, both operations can be done in O (log N ) time. However, in some important applications the trees are not balanced <ref> (e.g., models of temporal sequences, Delcher et al., 1993) </ref>. <p> The main goal of the experiment was to test if stable bonds far away from the mutated location were affected. Our previous results <ref> (Delcher et al., 1993) </ref> support the current thesis in the biology community, namely that local distant changes rarely affect structure.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, causal trees are fairly limited for modeling purposes. However similar structures, called join trees, arise in the course of one of the standard algorithms for computing with arbitrary Bayesian networks <ref> (see Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988) </ref>. Thus our algorithm for join trees has potential relevance to many networks that are not trees. Because join trees have some special structure, they allow some optimization of the basic causal-tree algorithm. We elaborate on this in Section 5. <p> Join Trees Perhaps the best-known technique for computing with arbitrary (i.e., not singly-connected) Bayesian networks uses the idea of join trees (junction trees) <ref> (Lauritzen & Spiegelhalter, 1988) </ref>. In many ways a join tree can be thought of as a causal tree, albeit one with somewhat special structure. Thus the algorithm in the previous section can be applied. However, the structure of a join tree permits some optimization, which we describe in this section.

Reference-contexts: Thus we will be careful to state this slowdown where it exists. Section 2 considers the case of causal trees, i.e., singly connected networks in which each node has at most one parent. The standard algorithm <ref> (see Pearl, 1988) </ref> must use O (k 2 N ) time for either updates or for retrieval, although one of these operations can be done in O (1) time.
