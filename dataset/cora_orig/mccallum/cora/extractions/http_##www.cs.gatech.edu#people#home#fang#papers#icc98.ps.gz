Abstract: We present a technique to enable the efficient simulation of large scale ATM networks, while preserving the accuracy of the end-to-end delay statistics. Our approach uses on-the-fly aggregation by observing traffic at monitoring points, then substituting an aggregate model, when appropriate. We focus in particular on the end-to-end delay distribution, given the importance of this distribution for continuous media. We find that our methods are able to achieve speedup of one order of magnitude, while maintaining accuracy within 5% of the unaggregated simulation. These results are observed in both a series of multiplexers and a 100-switch wide-area ATM topology.

Reference-contexts: The jitter problem is magnified in wide-area networks that have more potential for cross-traffic interaction and variation in switch buffer occupancy. The end-to-end delay distribution is, of course, partially determined by the scheduling discipline used at the switches in the network. Certain switching disciplines (e.g., Generalized Processor Sharing <ref> [1] </ref> or Stop-and-Go Queuing [2]) support bounds on the delay and delay jitter. However, these disciplines are not without overhead in complexity of implementation and multiplexing efficiency. For these reasons, we choose to focus on switches with first-come-first-serve (FCFS) queuing. FCFS is extremely efficient and easily implemented.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we investigate the effectiveness of our aggregation approach by applying one of the models, namely, the ON/OFF burst-based model, to a larger and more realistic wide-area ATM network simulation study. 6.1 Experimental Setup To generate a network topology, we use the GT-ITM graph generation package <ref> [13] </ref>. This package supports the generation of network topologies to reflect the transit-stub domain structure of the Internet, or any wide-area network comprising multiple administrative domains. Basically, the routers or switches are organized into two types of domains: transit and stub.
