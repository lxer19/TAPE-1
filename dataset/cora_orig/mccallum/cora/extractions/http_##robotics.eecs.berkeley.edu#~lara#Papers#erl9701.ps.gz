Abstract: In the present paper nonholonomic systems with drift terms are studied. The discussion is focused on a class of Lagrangian systems with a cyclic coordinate. We present an approach to open-loop path planning in which the system evolution is studied on manifolds of dimension equal to the number of control inputs. A control algorithm is derived and it is applied to the examples of a hopping robot and a planar diver. A similar algorithm is derived for the study of what states can be reached within a given time. An exponentially stabilizing feedback controller is derived for tracking of the planned trajectories. The results are illustrated with simulations.

Reference-contexts: A class of Lagrangian systems with a cyclic coordinate is investigated in this report as a step toward extending the understanding of control of systems with drift terms. The eventual goal is an increased repertoire of canonical forms. From Noether's Theorem <ref> (Arnold, 1989) </ref> it follows that if a Lagrangian system admits a one parameter group of diffeomorphisms, i.e. there is some kind of symmetry in the system such that the Lagrangian is invariant under some mapping, then a conservation law and a first integral exist. <p> chosen to be x n , and @L = 0 (6) If no generalized forces act in the direction of x n (Q n = 0), then the Euler Lagrange differential equations (Goldstein, 1980) yield d @ _x n = 0 (7) This is a special result of Noether's Theorem <ref> (Arnold, 1989) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In this section a new control law for stabilization of a class of nonholonomic systems to trajectories is derived. Nonholonomic systems in general cannot be stabilized to a point using static state feedback, since they violate Brock-ett's necessary condition for stabilizability <ref> (Brockett, 1983) </ref>. The control law presented here stabilizes systems (18) to a set of time-varying trajectories. It is assumed that a motion planner has generated a nominal trajectory which satisfies the nonholonomic constraints. A feedback control law is derived for tracking of this trajectory. <p> If p = 0 , then the vector field on the right side of (76) is not onto any open neighborhoods around the origin, since points of the type (0; : : : ; 0; l) (any small l) are not in any neighborhoods around the origin <ref> (Brockett, 1983) </ref>. fl Assumption 6.1 It is assumed that p is bounded by 0 &lt; M 1 kpk M 2 &lt; 1. Assumption 6.2 It is assumed that the time derivative of the vector p is upper bounded by k _ pk L for some L &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: This form is equivalent to the power form (Pomet and Samson, 1993). Sinu-soids have been used in motion planning for these systems because of their smoothness and periodic properties. Systems that can be put in chained form are in a subset of the larger class of nilpotentizable <ref> (Di Giamberardino et al., 1996) </ref> systems. A system is nilpotent when the Lie algebra is finite dimensional and all Lie brackets of order higher than a finite integer are zero (Kawski, 1988).

Reference-contexts: A cyclic coordinate means that the Lagrangian is invariant under, for example, a translation of the same coordinate. The first integral will be a conserved generalized momentum conjugate <ref> (Goldstein, 1980) </ref>. These systems exhibit a subtriangular structure, as the Jacobian of the vector fields with respect to the state is subtriangular. This structure will be utilized in the design below. If the constant value of this first integral is nonzero, then there is drift in the system. <p> Assume that there is one 5 cyclic coordinate <ref> (Goldstein, 1980) </ref> not contained in the Lagrangian. This coordinate may without loss of generality be chosen to be x n , and @L = 0 (6) If no generalized forces act in the direction of x n (Q n = 0), then the Euler Lagrange differential equations (Goldstein, 1980) yield d <p> 5 cyclic coordinate <ref> (Goldstein, 1980) </ref> not contained in the Lagrangian.

Reference-contexts: If a system is nilpotent, or nilpotentizable by a diffeomorphic transformation, then Kawski (1993) gives a simple algorithm for transformation to a canonical nonlinear representation of the system. Nilpotent approximations are useful for local stabilization <ref> (Hermes et al., 1984) </ref>. An extension of the derivation of canonical forms to systems with drift terms is a case for further study.

Lagrangian systems of this class where the flat outputs depend on the configuration variables are called configuration flat (Rathinam and Mur-ray, 1996).

Reference-contexts: Classification of nonholonomic systems has also been explored in the literature. A powerful motivation for finding simple standardized forms is to 1 generate reusable control schemes that can be applied to classes of nonlin-ear control systems. The search for canonical forms by <ref> (Murray and Sas-try, 1993) </ref> defined the chained form, which has since gained much popularity. This form is equivalent to the power form (Pomet and Samson, 1993). Sinu-soids have been used in motion planning for these systems because of their smoothness and periodic properties. <p> Obstacle avoidance is a traditional difficulty that must be considered in motion planning when moving in a cluttered environment. In that case the initial and desired configurations must lie in the same connected component of the free configuration space for the motion planning problem to be solvable <ref> (Murray and Sastry, 1993) </ref>. Obstacle is however not discussed further in this report. Open-loop paths are very sensitive to initial condition errors. A feedback control law, which closes the loop around the planned trajectory is derived in order to render the control scheme more robust. <p> If = 0, then the system is drift free, and can be converted into chained form <ref> (Murray and Sastry, 1993) </ref>. The associated control system has two inputs and three states. <p> This algorithm provides nominal trajectories and inputs. The second part is a feedback tracking control law, which closes the loop and forces the actual state to follow the nominal trajectory under the influence of small disturbances. It is well-known that open-loop planners sometimes are very sensitive to initial errors <ref> (Murray and Sastry, 1993) </ref>, and this motivates the design of feedback control laws. In this section a new control law for stabilization of a class of nonholonomic systems to trajectories is derived.

Reference-contexts: It is assumed that a motion planner has generated a nominal trajectory which satisfies the nonholonomic constraints. A feedback control law is derived for tracking of this trajectory. A previous solution to this problem was given in <ref> (Walsh et al., 1994) </ref>. That solution was based on a linearization of the system around a nominal trajectory, and hence gave local results. It provided exponential convergence whenever a time varying matrix was positive and bounded. The area of attraction for the resulting controller was not discussed.
