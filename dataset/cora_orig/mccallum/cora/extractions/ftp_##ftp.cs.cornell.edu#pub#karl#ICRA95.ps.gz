Abstract: The existing industrial parts feeders move the parts through a sequence of mechanical filters that reject parts in unwanted orientations. In this paper we develop a new setup that uses a different vibratory mechanism to systematically manipulate parts, by actively orienting and localizing them. The idea is to generate and change dynamic modes for a plate by varying the applied frequency of oscillation. Depending on the node shapes of the plate for these frequencies, the position and orientation of the parts can be controlled. We develop an analysis of the underlying dynamics, and show that it can be used to predict the behavior of objects placed on the vibrating plate. Using this analysis, we propose that the applied frequencies can be automatically sequenced to obtain a "sensorless" strategy for manipulating a given object.

Reference-contexts: If t P () &gt; 0 there is a moment acting on P that will cause a counterclockwise instantaneous rotation. t P () &lt; 0 corresponds to a clockwise instantaneous rotation. Roots of the turn function correspond to equilibrium configurations. It can be shown (see Bohringer et al. <ref> [1] </ref>) that an equilibrium is stable if t P changes from positive to negative at , otherwise it is metastable. <p> Note how the part aligns with the node at an angle of 70 ffi 1:2, as predicted by the alignment function a P (0) 1:2 in Figure 8c.

Thus we obtain sensorless part alignment plans that are similar to the robot grasp plans developed by Goldberg [9], and the actuator array plans described by Bohringer et al. <ref> [1] </ref>, and Will and Liu [26].

Reference-contexts: For our device, we further propose a "sensorless" strategy for part manipulation [7], using the theory originally developed for feeding parts using parallel-jaw grippers [9], which was recently extended to arrays of microactuators (Bohringer et al. <ref> [2] </ref>). Working independently, Will and Liu are also exploring the idea of using a dense array of microactuators to create programmable 'force fields' that can be used to position and orient small parts. Their simulator and initial designs for such fields are reported in [26].

Reference-contexts: A parts feeder is a machine that orients such parts before they are fed to an assembly station.

To improve feedrate, it is sometimes possible to design the track so as to mechanically rotate parts into a desired orientation (this is called conversion). Related methods use centrifugal forces [8], reciprocating forks, or belts to move parts through the filter [18].

Reference-contexts: Each filter reduces the feeding rate. 4. The filters have to be redesigned for each new part geometry, a task that usually requires skillful work by human experts. 1 In the early 1980's, several researchers used sensors to determine the pose of parts delivered by a vibratory 1 Caine <ref> [4] </ref> presented an experimental CAD system that assists the construction of track filters for vibratory bowl feeders.

Reference-contexts: Note how after two steps the parts reach approximately the same rest configuration. In his analysis for robot grasp plans, Goldberg [9] shows that any polygonal part can be aligned up to symmetry by such a sensorless alignment plan. Chen and Ierardi <ref> [5] </ref> showed that the length of the plan is linear in the number of rest configurations of the part. 7 Extensions and Future Work Further experiments need to be done to study the effect of surface geometry and friction properties on the final part configuration.

Reference-contexts: The idea is to generate and change dynamic modes in a plate by varying applied frequencies. Depending on the frequency of vibration and the boundary conditions, nodes of different shapes are formed (this was experimentally studied by Chladni <ref> [6] </ref>). If planar parts are put on this vibrating plate, they move to the node, and end up in a stable orientation. We develop an analysis whereby given the shape of the node, and the part geometry, the final orientation can be predicted. <p> The resulting motion is similar to the forced transverse vibration of a rectangular plate, clamped on one edge and free along the other three sides. The nodes for these transverse oscillations can either be obtained theoretically (Rayleigh [17], Timo-shenko [24]), or experimentally using the technique originally pioneered by Chladni <ref> [6] </ref>. By sprinkling small sized particles (Chladni used sand, we use Urad lentils to get a better contrast on video) on a vibrating surface, the nodes can be experimentally identified as the regions where the particles tend to collect. <p> When particles are spread on a vibrating surface, they collect at the nodes, resulting in patterns known as Chladni figures (after Chladni <ref> [6] </ref>). Rayleigh [17] describes the motion of the particles towards the nodes in the following words - "the movement to the nodes is irregular in its character. If a grain be situated elsewhere than at a node, it is made to jump by a sufficiently vigorous transverse vibration.
