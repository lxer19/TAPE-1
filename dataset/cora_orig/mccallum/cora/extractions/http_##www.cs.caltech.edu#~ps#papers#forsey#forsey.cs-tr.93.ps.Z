Abstract: We consider the construction of spline features on spline surfaces. 1 The approach taken is a generalization of the hierarchical surface introduced in [Forsey88]. Features are regarded as spline-defined vector displacement fields that are overlain on existing surfaces. No assumption is made that the overlays are derived from the base surface. They may be applied with any orientation in a non-hierarchical fashion. In particular, we present a "cheap" version of the concept in which the displacement field is mapped to the base surface approximately, through the mapping of its control vectors alone. The result is a feature that occupies the appropriate position in space with respect to the base surface. It may be manipulated and rendered as an independent spline, thus avoiding the costs of a true displacement mapping. This approach is useful for prototyping and previewing during design. When a finished product is desired, of course, true displacement mapping is employed.

It could equally well be represented as a much higher degree spline consisting of many more patches.

Displacement mappings are standard tools in computer graphics [Foley90], and applying them in a stagewise fashion to layer features onto a surface substrate is an idea that requires little innovation to carry into implementation. <p> Such surfaces are procedurally defined, and every manipulation must be made implicitly, modifying the displacement and tracking the effect through the construction process for every point to be rendered and evaluated. The hierarchical surfaces of <ref> [Forsey88] </ref> avoided this expense by mapping only the control vertices of each level of displacement onto their corresponding base surfaces. The resulting composite surfaces were limited in their forms by the requirement that each displacement region be derived from the root surface by a nested sequence of refinements. <p> The displaced version of the point S (u; v) is given by some interpretation of the affine, point-vector sum S (u; v) + d (r (u; v); s (u; v)). In the terminology of <ref> [Forsey88] </ref>, S is the base surface, d is an overlay, and S + d constitutes a new base surface to which further overlays may be applied. If this process is carried out repeatedly, the various domain images D d will form a layered composite of regions. <p> Needless to say, this hampers the interactive use of displacements as a modeling tool. The restriction of strict domain nesting and alignment, provided by subdivision, made a restricted form of displacements interactively supportable in <ref> [Forsey88] </ref>. The reason for the qualifying phrase "some interpretation of " in the above description arises from the requirement that the overlay be sensitive to the local topography of the base.
