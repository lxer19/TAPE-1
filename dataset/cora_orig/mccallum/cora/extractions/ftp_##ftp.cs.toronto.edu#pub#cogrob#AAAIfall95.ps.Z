Title: Goals and Rational Action in the Situation Calculus| A Preliminary Report  
Author: Steven Shapiro, Yves Lesperance and Hector J. Levesque 
Address: Toronto, ON, M5S 1A4 Canada  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Toronto  
Abstract: In this paper, we use an extended version of the situation calculus to formalize goals and rational action. We then use these notions and a definition of ability (Lesperance et al. 1995b) to show that an agent that is acting rationally will achieve its goals when it is able to do so.

Reference-contexts: Levesque 1993) to add an explicit representation of knowledge to the situation calculus with Cohen and Levesque's <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1990) </ref> formalization of intentions in terms of modalities for beliefs and goals. One cannot predict what an agent will do based solely on the specification of its knowledge and goals. <p> Following <ref> (Cohen & Levesque 1990) </ref>, we characterize the goals of the agent by specifying the paths (sequences of situations, which we model using ASFs) in which all the goals (both maintenance goals and achievement goals) are achieved.

Reference-contexts: Given a specification for H, we can formally state what we mean by a goal. As noted in <ref> (Konolige & Pollack 1993) </ref>, there are some difficulties with using Cohen and Levesque's definition of a goal. They define a goal to be any formula that is true in all goal paths. Suppose that ff ^ fi is a goal.

The agent can only dial a combination if the safe is intact, and it is not possible to change the combination of the safe.

Reference-contexts: While this is still work in progress, to our knowledge it is the first attempt to develop a theory of rational action that appeals to the abilities of the agent. 2 Previous work 2.1 Theory of action Our theory is based on an extended version of the situation calculus <ref> (McCarthy & Hayes 1979) </ref>, a predicate calculus dialect for representing dynamically changing worlds. In this formalism, the world is taken to be in a certain situation. That situation can only change as a result of an agent performing an action. <p> It is usually necessary to add frame axioms that specify when fluents remain unchanged by actions. The frame problem <ref> (McCarthy & Hayes 1979) </ref> arises because the number of these frame axioms is of the order of the product of the number of fluents and the number of actions.

K (s 0 ; s) represents the fact that in situation s, the agent thinks that it could be in situation s 0 . We call s 0 an alternative situation to s.

How can we model the effects on the world of reading the combination? Scherl and Levesque <ref> (Scherl & Levesque 1993) </ref> call this type of actions (e.g., perception and communication actions) knowledge-producing actions, and they provide an account of how to represent these actions in the situation calculus. Such actions affect the mental state of the agent rather than the state of the external world.
