Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to the contour extraction of moving objects in an image sequence. Our approach is to fuse information from color segmentation, motion segmentation, and active contour (snake) to achieve accurate extraction of the boundary of moving objects. It works well not only for a single moving object, but also for images having mutiple moving objects. Several experiments have been conducted to show the promise of our algorithm.
