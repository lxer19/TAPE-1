Abstract: We present a compuational module for interactively visualizing, large-scale, 3-D unstructured meshes. Scientist and engineering routinely solve large-scale computational boundary value problems on unstructured grids. These grids typically range from several hundred thousand elements to millions of elements. With this ability to solve such large-scale problems comes the challenge of viewing the 3D finite element model geometry on a 2D screen. When the mesh is non-uniform, the researcher's ability to grasp the complex spatial relationships of the elements often fails. The visualization module we have developed for viewing large-scale 3D unstructured finite element meshes includes two novel real-time interactive methods: a clipping "surface" utility and a growth algorithm. Used separately or together, these new utilities allow the user to better explore complicated unstructured polygonal domains.

Reference-contexts: Mesh visualization is important for assessing solution accuracy, checking geometrical integrity (identifying missing and/or distorted elements), and interactive editing. Furthermore, with the advent of adaptive refinement and derefinement methods which alter the structure of the mesh, <ref> [HS92, SL94, JM94, MEJ94, YJ94] </ref> it is especially helpful to visualize the the changes taking place as an area of the mesh is refined. The computational mesh or grid is usually one of two types: structured or unstructured.

Reference-contexts: MeshView contains a suite of options to provide the user with complete interactive control for mesh visualization. The module is part of a data-flow based computational steering system, SciRun, used for the interactive control of science and engineering boundary value problems. <ref> [JP94] </ref>. SciRun provides MeshView with standard viewing capabilites such as rotation, translation, and scaling. 2 Methods MeshView allows the user to choose from a variety of different options for exploring the mesh. <p> understand the spatial relationships between the 3D elements. 2 All tetrahedra sharing a face with the seed tetrahedron. c) All tetrahedra sharing a face with those in (b). d) All tetrahedra sharing a face with those in (c). 3 3 Results Data enters MeshView via SciRun, the computational steering program <ref> [JP94] </ref>. Setup within SciRun is a map consisting of an input module, computation module (s), and an output module. In this case, the input module reads in the data points and connectivities of the mesh. The computation module contains the algorithms developed for MeshView.

However, unstructured meshes present the more difficult task of grasping spatial relationships of unstructed 3D objects in 2-space. One common technique to assist in viewing these meshes is to use clipping planes <ref> [MEJ94] </ref>. When this technique is applied to unstructured meshes, however, the clipping plane cuts through portions of elements, leaving line segments on the edges of the mesh. Speray and Kennon addressed this problem by devising a method of volume probes for interactive data exploration [SK90].

The output module is the geometry viewer, which displays the mesh. The program is written in C++ using Tk/Tcl <ref> [Ous94] </ref>. MeshView is currently implemented on SGI workstations, but ports to other platforms are in progress. 3.1 Statistics The program was tested on a Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 workstation with a 100Mhz R4000 processor, 96 Mbytes main memory, and a 1 Mbyte cache.

Speray and Kennon addressed this problem by devising a method of volume probes for interactive data exploration <ref> [SK90] </ref>. This method cuts sections of grids and displays them on 2-D surfaces. However, the volume relationships between elements is lost when this technique is applied to elements displayed as 2-D surfaces.
