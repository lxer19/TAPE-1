Abstract: Improved Hardness Results for Abstract First, a simplified geometric proof is presented for the result of Lund and Yannakakis saying that for some * &gt; 0 it is NP-hard to approximate the chromatic number of graphs with N vertices by a factor of N * . Then, more sophisticated techniques are employed to improve the exponent. A randomized twisting method allows us to completely pack a certain space with copies of a graph without much affecting the independence number. Together with the newest results of Bellare, Goldreich and Sudan on the number of amortized free bits, it is shown that for every * &gt; 0 the chromatic number cannot be approximated by a factor of N 1=5* unless NP=ZPP. Finally, we get polynomial lower bounds in terms of O. Unless NP=ZPP, the performance ratio of every polynomial time algorithm approximating the chromatic number of O-colorable graphs (i.e., the chromatic number is at most O) is at least O 1=5o(1) (where the o-notation is with respect to O).

Reference-contexts: Using this lower bound for the Maximum Independent Set problem, our method improves the lower bound for the Chromatic number problem to N 1=7o (1) under the same assumption. Finally, Bellare, Goldreich and Sudan <ref> [3, 4] </ref> have decreased the number of free bits f to 2 + * for every * &gt; 0 improving the lower bound for Maximum Independent Set to N 1=3* under the weaker ZPP 6= NP assumption. <p> First we describe a preliminary construction of H that only treats the good case (large independent set) properly. Then we apply a slight but crucial modification to accommodate a proper treatment for the bad case too. We describe the construction for f = 2 + * <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. In this case, q is approximately equal to r 2 . By a slight modification of G, w.l.o.g. we can assume that q = r 2 . The vertices of H are the grid points of a four di-mensional rectangular prism. <p> An efficient approximation algorithm for the chromatic number of ~ H would therefore approximate the independence number of G well, which is known to be hard [5, 6, 4]. Generalizing for arbitrary f (instead of the currently best f = 2 + * <ref> [3, 4] </ref>), the result is an N 1=(1+2df*e+* 0 ) lower bound on the performance ratio of approximating the chromatic number, for any polynomial time algorithm based under the ZPP 6= NP assumption.
