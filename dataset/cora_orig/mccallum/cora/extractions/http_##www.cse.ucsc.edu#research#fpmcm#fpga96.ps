Abstract: FPLD architectures are often designed based on the results of experiments with "typical" benchmark circuits. For very large FPLDs, it may be difficult to obtain enough benchmark circuits to accurately evaluate an architecture. In this paper, we present a method for generating large random circuits with a fixed number of inputs, outputs, blocks, pins per cell, and approximate rent exponent. The circuits generated are used to evaluate several routability measures. We find that routability is best predicted by estimating the total wirelength in the circuit, not the mean wirelength times pins per cell.

Reference-contexts: He was able to establish that the channel densities were Poisson distributed with mean l=2. This average channel density was the figure used to gauge routability in [CSZ93] and was the basis for the statistical derviation in <ref> [BFRV92] </ref>. El Gamal does not stop here, however. El Gamal also derives an expression for the number of tracks whose density exceedes the maximum width w, based on the expected number of tracks with density d.

Reference-contexts: Each terminal generates a single wire which travels to its destination on a random shortest path.

El Gamal also derives an expression for the number of tracks whose density exceedes the maximum width w, based on the expected number of tracks with density d. <p> In contrast, more recent work on routability prediction uses a metric which is only indirectly employs the number of cells in the design. <ref> [CSZ93] </ref> Reviews previous work and uses Feuer's model to estimate wire internal and external lengths based on a extracted Rent exponent from min-cut based initial placement. <p> Since all of the predictors we will be using will be based on wirelength, this removes some of the error that could cloud our appraisal. The following predictors are examined: H1 El Gamal's Channel Width Estimator (l=2) H2 El Gamal modifed by star expansion from <ref> [CSZ93] </ref>. H3 Total placed wirelength in circuit (perimeter ap proximation) Figures corresponding to each hypothesis are shown below. In each case, the horizontal axis is the value of the metric and the vertical axis is the value of the PPR-reported delay in nanoseconds.

Reference-contexts: of unrouted connections * Delay as estimated by ppr We can now use this data to compare some routabil-ity heuristics. 4.2 Previous work on routability El Gamal developed a theoretical model for the distribution of channel densities on masterslice ICs given a mean pins per cell and a wirelength distribution <ref> [Gam81] </ref>. He assumed that the terminals were scattered randomly in an infinite lattice and that we wished to estimate the distribution of channel densities for a finite subsection. Each terminal generates a single wire which travels to its destination on a random shortest path.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the clustering produced by rmc is only one of many possible clusterings. We need to consider the possibility that a better partitioning could be found. To examine the real Rent parameters of the circuits, we used the ratio cut partitioner <ref> [WC91] </ref> to decompose the circuit into clusters. The clustering produced by ratio cut is shown in figure 4. Rcut against the target rent exponent given to rmc. We observe that value of the measured Rent paramter varies by +/-0.1 on either side of the target value.
