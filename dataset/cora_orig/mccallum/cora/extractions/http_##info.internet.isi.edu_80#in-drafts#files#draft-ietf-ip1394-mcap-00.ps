Note: Expire:  IEEE 1394 STATUS OF THIS DOCUMENT This document is an Internet-Draft. Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts. To view the entire list of current Internet-Drafts, please check the "1id-abstracts.txt" listing contained in the Internet-Drafts Shadow Directories on  (Pacific Rim), ds.internic.net (US  (US  See also the most recent revision of draft-ietf-ip1394-ipv4 for a specification of the transport of IPv4 datagrams over IEEE 1394.  
Abstract: Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material or to cite them other than as "work in progress." ABSTRACT This document specifies how IP-capable Serial Bus devices may allocate IEEE 1394 channel number(s) for use in the multicast transmission of IP datagrams. It defines the necessary methods, data structures and codes for that purpose. CAUTION: This is a WORKING DOCUMENT of the IETF IP/1394 group; some parts reflect rough consensus achieved at the 41st IETF meeting in Los Angeles, other parts reflect the editor's distillation of comments on the reflector since then and still other parts are new contributions to the evolution of MCAP. Until subsequent revisions of this document are posted that more clearly identify agreed areas, the reader should consider this a work in progress very much subject to revision. This document is not yet adopted by the IP/1394 working group.
