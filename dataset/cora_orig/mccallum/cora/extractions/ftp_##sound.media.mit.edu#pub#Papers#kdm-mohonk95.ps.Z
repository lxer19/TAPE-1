Abstract: Modeling of human auditory localization has largely been limited to lateralization, or left-to-right position. This paper describes an attempt to tackle the more complicated problem of position estimation with two degrees of freedom (azimuth and elevation). Differences in interaural intensity and arrival time are extracted from the acoustic signals at the left and right eardrums, and an estimate of position is formed which is optimal for certain classes of source signals. Examples of spatial likelihood maps generated by the model are given and the types of errors made by the model are quantified. It is suggested that such a model may work well in conjunction with a spectral cue model like the one suggested by Zakarauskas and Cynader (J. Acoust. Soc. Amer., Vol. 94, 1993, pp. 1323-1331).

Reference-contexts: Interaural Differences, Localization and the Precedence Effect Interaural differences are often cited as the most significant cues for lateralization (left-to-right position), and spectral cues based on features of the HRTF are given credit for humans' ability to perform vertical localization tasks <ref> [1] </ref>. Zakarauskas and Cynader describe a localization model based on spectral features [2]. <p> The cutoff frequency for the smoothing filter is set to the CF of each channel, but limited to 800 Hz, which has been reported to be a good match to the envelope-following ability of the auditory periphery <ref> [1] </ref>. This limit allows reasonable interaural level comparisons to be made, while still retaining enough modulation energy for IED estimation. The envelopes are equivalent to a running estimate of rms energy in each channel. Onset Detection.

Reference-contexts: Zakarauskas and Cynader describe a localization model based on spectral features <ref> [2] </ref>. <p> Currently, the model can not distinguish two sources at different positions on the median plane. To rectify this problem, it is suggested that a spectral cue model similar to the one proposed in <ref> [2] </ref> be integrated with the current model. 6.

Reference-contexts: are largely dismissed as cues for vertical localization, possibly because most studies of vertical localization are conducted with source locations on the median plane, where interaural differences are minimized, although Searle et al. have described a localization model based on interaural differences for sources on or near the median plane <ref> [3] </ref>, and Lim and Duda have shown that interaural intensity differences are viable vertical localization cues for sources away from the median plane [4]. These models estimate azimuth and elevation independently rather than in combination.

The goal is to produce a model that calculates a set of interaural cues and infers a position on the two-dimensional surface of a sphere directly. <p> This information is used by the interaural (180 ffi &lt; &lt; 180 ffi ) and elevation (90 ffi &lt; &lt; 90 ffi ). difference estimator to model the precedence effect <ref> [5] </ref>. The in-teraural difference estimators use the outputs of the filter bank, the envelope estimators, and the onset detectors to extract the IID, IPD, and IED at onsets in each frequency band.

Reference-contexts: Psychologically, there is evidence that interaural differences are strongly weighted by human listeners at onsets. This has been demonstrated in experiments related to the precedence effect <ref> [7] </ref>. At present, an extremely simple method of onset detection has been implemented. In each frequency band, the two envelope signals are summed, and local maxima are identified. <p> The weighting is accomplished by a window function, which takes the form w (t) = At exp (t=t ). The effective width of the window used is 2-3 ms, as suggested by the results in <ref> [7] </ref>, and the peak of the window function is centered at each detected onset. This weighting function is an important part of the precedence effect model, allowing suppressed onsets to have some small influence on the IID estimated by the model.

Reference-contexts: Onsets arising from different sources in a multiple-source signal might therefore be separated, and unnatural interaural differences (such as extremely large IIDs) might be discounted, as suggested by Rakerd and Hartmann <ref> [11] </ref>.
