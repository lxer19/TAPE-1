Reference-contexts: This report primarily intends to develop better instruments for endoscopy by modifying the current tools or by designing new ones. 2 Endoscopes and Accessories Most of the background on endoscopes and the accessories discussed in this section is provided in <ref> [1] </ref>. Modern flexible endoscopes are typically variations on the same design shown in Figure 1. The endoscope consists of a headset connected to a long flexible tube which is inserted into the body. The headset holds buttons for controlling the video options, suction, air, and water. <p> The tool channel is located in the flexible 2 tube and exits at the tip. The flexible tube is attached to the end of the headset. The length of the flexible tube varies between 70 110 cm for `short' endoscopes and 165 180 cm for `long' endoscopes <ref> [1] </ref>. The flexible tube contains a tool channel, one or two light sources, a lens for the optics and one or two air/water channels. The inner diameters of tool channels range between 2:8 mm and 5:5 mm. The typical inner diameter of tool channels is 2:8 mm. <p> The descending colon is attached to the sigmoid colon which leads to the rectum and the anus. More information on upper GI endoscopy, colonoscopy, and ERCP is contained in <ref> [1] </ref> and [15]. A detailed atlas of the gasrointestinal tract and its diseases with video images from endoscopic procedures is contained in [16]. Much of the information provided in this section is contained in [1], [15], and [16]. 3.1 Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) Endoscopy Upper GI Endoscopy is used to examine and <p> More information on upper GI endoscopy, colonoscopy, and ERCP is contained in <ref> [1] </ref> and [15].

Much of the information provided in this section is contained in [1], [15], and [16]. 3.1 Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) Endoscopy Upper GI Endoscopy is used to examine and perform surgery in the esophagus, stomach and duodenum. <p> Peristaltic action is also used as a guide to the insertion of the endoscope. Various abnormalities are viewed during colonoscopy. Colitis or inflammation of the colon is examined during colonoscopy as well as strictures although contrast studies are often more useful <ref> [1] </ref>. Diverticula, outpouches of the colon wall at sites of weakness, can be seen during colonoscopy. Polyps and tumors are examined in colonoscopy. Colonic polyps vary in shape and size. <p> The snare is then tightened further as coagulation current is applied to cauterize the tissue and lessen bleeding. Sometimes there are blood vessels in the interior of the stalk of the polyp. A larger stalk is more likely to contain a blood vessel than a smaller stalk <ref> [1] </ref>. The snare surrounds the vessel with pressure and cuts off blood flow as it is cauterized. The coagulation current may be varied as the 10 snare is tightened. After the polyp is removed, it can be sucked into the suction trap or picked up later with a three-pronged grasper.

Reference-contexts: Three rotary actuator designs are described in this subsection. The first design uses a high pitch screw in a fixed housing attached to a small piston, such as the pistons described in <ref> [2] </ref>. The design is shown in Figure 9. As the screw is pushed or pulled through the housing, the screw rotates. Tendons can also be used to push and to 16 pull on the screw.

Reference-contexts: The coefficient, , is calculated so that the sum in (22) produces tension forces in the three tendons above a tension offset. F tendons = T ( p ) t + nv (22) This is the same method described in <ref> [4] </ref> for producing tendon forces in tension. Tension is a negative force since it decreases the length of the tendon. The desired tendon force is then converted to a pulse width modulated signal to produce a torque in the motors.

Reference-contexts: These set of coordinates lead to a simple form for the dynamic equations which are described in the next section. Similar choice of coordinates are used in modeling of the eye where one wants to minimize the twisting in the optic nerve <ref> [5] </ref>. In this case, the spherical spring joint is identified with the optic nerve. In the analysis of the reorientation of the falling cat, similar coordinates have been used to model the joint in the spinal column of true cats [18].

Reference-contexts: Electronic video endoscopes are improving and are more popular than fiberoptic scopes according to [10]. There have been attempts to improve the mechanical function of the endoscope and the tools. An endoscopic suturing device is described in <ref> [6] </ref>. Some researchers propose modifying the entire endoscope as in [17] and [9]. It is the belief of this author that a primary failure of current endoscopic instruments is the lack of the ability to perform fine motion control. Without it, tasks take longer than necessary and accuracy is lost.

Reference-contexts: Notice that the map is not defined when z 3 = 1. The inverse map is given by (z 1 ; z 2 ; z 3 ) = (ut; vt; t 1) (2) where t = 2 1+u 2 +v 2 . As stated in <ref> [7] </ref>, the rotation matrix formed by rotating about an axis k = (k x ; k y ; k z ) T by an angle is given by Rot (k; ) = 6 k x k x v + c k y k x v k z s k z k

Reference-contexts: By individually pulling on the tendons, the outer plate changes orientation relative to the inner plate. It was recently noticed that the original design to orient the outer plate relative to the inner plate from which the current design was developed is similar to a design seen in <ref> [8] </ref>. The tool slides through both plates and the same devices on the tip of a normal endoscope are on the outer plate. The position of the tool tip is changed 15 by pulling on the tendons.

Reference-contexts: Endoscopy can extend the patients life in these cases. Major improvements have been made in endoscopy by providing clearer images of the interior of the patient. Electronic video endoscopes are improving and are more popular than fiberoptic scopes according to <ref> [10] </ref>. There have been attempts to improve the mechanical function of the endoscope and the tools. An endoscopic suturing device is described in [6]. Some researchers propose modifying the entire endoscope as in [17] and [9]. <p> The inner diameters of tool channels range between 2:8 mm and 5:5 mm. The typical inner diameter of tool channels is 2:8 mm. The typical outer diameter of endoscopes is 11 mm with a 10 mm inner diameter <ref> [10] </ref>. The endoscope tip contains the tool channel, light sources, water/air outlets, and optics. These devices are located on the side on side-viewing endoscopes or duodenoscopes used in biliary examinations and operations. The duodenoscopes also have an elevator to provide additional control over the placement of the tool tip.

Reference-contexts: The spring constants were experimentally determined and are k = 100; 000g cm 2 =(s 2 cm) and k fl = 112; 000g cm=(s 2 rad). The PD gains were designed in Matlab <ref> [11] </ref> using the linear quadratic regulator based on the linear error dynamics at the origin. The tool was commanded to step to u = 0:3 and v = 0:2 from an initial condition close to the origin. The simulated response in position is shown in Figure 20.

Reference-contexts: The body angular velocity, ! b , written as a skew-symmetric matrix is ^! b = R T _ R. See <ref> [12] </ref> for more details on this description of the body angular velocity. <p> See <ref> [12] </ref> for a derivation. <p> The error and error velocity pass through gain matrices to produce a desired torque in the tool coordinates. The spring force in the current configuration is computed and is added to the desired torque from the PD controller. This is a modified PD controller described in <ref> [12] </ref> however the inertial and Coriolis forces are ignored in this particular controller.

Campbell. </author> <title> Efficient computation of forward kinematics and jacobian matrix of a stewart platform-based manipulator. </title> <booktitle> In IEEE Proceedings of SOUTHEASTCON, </booktitle> <address> Williamsburg, Va., </address> <year> 1991. </year>
Reference-contexts: This information is used to calculate the tool coordinates as well as the velocity of the tool in these coordinates. The inverse kinematics of the platform are solved easily while the forward kinematics are difficult to solve. This also occurs in the Stewart platform. See <ref> [13] </ref> for more details on the Stewart platform. The equations relating the tool coordinates are nonlinear and difficult to invert. See the equations in the Appendix. The controller numerically solves for the roots of polynomials and produces a vector, p := (u; v; 0) T . <p> The velocity of the length of the tendons and J p 1 ( p ) are used to calculate the velocity in the tool coordinates assuming no twist. This velocity is _ p . This is similar to the method of calculating the velocity in <ref> [13] </ref>. The velocity and the position 29 30 information are subtracted from the desired trajectory and an error, e = pdes p , and error velocity, _e, are formed. The error and error velocity pass through gain matrices to produce a desired torque in the tool coordinates.

Reference-contexts: The coagulation current may be varied as the 10 snare is tightened. After the polyp is removed, it can be sucked into the suction trap or picked up later with a three-pronged grasper. Some endoscopists suck the polyp as it is removed which saves time retrieving the polyp <ref> [14] </ref>. The polyp and biopsies are sent to the lab for examination. 3.3 Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP is a technique used to opacify the biliary tree and pancreatic duct system in the duodenum and perform endoscopic surgeries in this area.

The output is negative tendon forces. The controller has not been implemented on the prototype but will be implemented in the near future. 31 6.5 Simulation Results The system was simulated in Mathematica <ref> [19] </ref> with parameters measured from a prototype. The spring model in (20) was used in the controller and in the dynamic model. The current parameters are d = 1:3cm, dt = 0:5cm, rt = 0:6cm, and rb = 0:6 cm.
