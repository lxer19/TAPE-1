Abstract: We present a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether a set of species, described by the characters they exhibit, has a phylogenetic tree, assuming the maximum number of possible states for a character is fixed. This solves an open problem posed by Kannan and Warnow. Our result should be contrasted with the proof by Steel and Bodlaender, Fellows, and Warnow that the phylogeny problem is NP-complete in general.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we pursue the second approach. When r = 2, the binary character case, an elegant characterization of the set of "yes" instances [5] leads to efficient algorithms <ref> [1, 8] </ref>. Dress and Steel [4] devised a O (nm 2 ) algorithm for r 3. Kannan and Warnow [10] gave a polynomial-time algorithm for r 4 and conjectured the existence polynomial-time algorithms for any fixed r.

Reference-contexts: We should note that instances of the phylogeny problem are often expressed in matrix form, by giving the set of species S as an n fi m matrix M whose rows are the species in S. The phylogeny problem was shown to be NP-complete by Bodlaender et al. <ref> [2] </ref> and, independently, by Steel [12]. This fact suggests at least two lines of attack: one is to restrict m, the number of characters; the other is to restrict r.

Reference-contexts: One can use memoization (a technique described in some detail in pp. 312-314 of <ref> [3] </ref>) to obtain an equivalent top-down recursive algorithm with the same running time. Such a procedure has been proposed to us by E.L. Lawler (personal communication).
