Reference-contexts: While this strategy has been shown to be effective for moderate to high rate video compression applications (e.g., the MPEG-1 video coding standard <ref> [1] </ref>), it neglects the fact that significant correlation may exist between the predicted and residual images. To achieve superior rate-distortion performance, this correlation should be exploited in applications that require high compression ratios.

Reference-contexts: To achieve superior rate-distortion performance, this correlation should be exploited in applications that require high compression ratios. Recently, we have presented preliminary results on a new predictive coding technique that we call vector restoration, that adaptively exploits the non-trivial correlation between the predicted and residual signals <ref> [2] </ref>. Vector restoration (VR) is closely related to the technique of residual vector quantization (VQ) [3]. We previously have shown that VQ is a special and suboptimal case of VR [2]. <p> predictive coding technique that we call vector restoration, that adaptively exploits the non-trivial correlation between the predicted and residual signals <ref> [2] </ref>. Vector restoration (VR) is closely related to the technique of residual vector quantization (VQ) [3]. We previously have shown that VQ is a special and suboptimal case of VR [2]. Experiments showed performance gains over VQ and a transform-based technique for the low bit rate compression of video, at the expense of increased encoder and decoder complexity. <p> The codebook generation for tree-structured vector restoration (TSVR) and vector quantization (TSVQ) differ only slightly in the specifics of the calculation of the codebook entries and the splitting of these entries to generate higher-rate codebooks. In our initial study <ref> [2] </ref>, we provided a detailed treatment of the calculation of the optimum restoration function from a partitioned set of training vectors using the generalized Lloyd algorithm [6].

Reference-contexts: Towards this end, in this article we extend the extensively researched concepts of tree-structured codebooks and optimal codebook pruning <ref> [4, 5] </ref> to vector restoration. We provide a brief discussion on the relationship between pruned tree-structured VR and VQ, and we include experimental comparisons between these techniques for the compression of several standard video-conferencing sequences. 2. <p> Once the tree-structured VR codebook has been generated for the desired depth, optimal codebook pruning using the generalized BFOS algorithm <ref> [4] </ref> can be applied directly to obtain variable rate TSVR codebooks. The two variants of this technique trade either average rate (length-pruned tree structure) or average entropy (entropy-pruned tree structure) for average distortion by discarding nodes from the tree, resulting in an unbalanced tree structure. 3.

Reference-contexts: In our initial study [2], we provided a detailed treatment of the calculation of the optimum restoration function from a partitioned set of training vectors using the generalized Lloyd algorithm <ref> [6] </ref>. Higher rate TSVR codebooks are obtained by splitting the terminal nodes restoration functions of an initial codebook into left and right children (lchild and rchild) restoration function nodes. We split the parent restoration function by perturbing the translation portion of the restoration function.

Reference-contexts: Future work will include comparisons of optimally pruned TSVR with rate-controlled DCT-based coders. While this study focused on reduced complexity vector restoration through tree-structured codebooks, we also plan to examine the performance of an entropy-constrained vector restoration implementation <ref> [7] </ref>.
