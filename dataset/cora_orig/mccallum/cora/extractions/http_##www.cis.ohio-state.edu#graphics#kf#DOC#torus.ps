Abstract: In this paper, methods are presented for cutting the surface of a polygonal shape that is homeomorphic to the torus. A number of issues are discussed as to how to find loops of a desired characteristic on the surface of a polyhedrally-defined torus and how to cut the torus into two parts by using the loops discovered. A method for finding a homeo-morphism for toroidal surfaces is also described, which is important for shape transformation and texture mapping in graphics.

Reference-contexts: A set of loop types is known to form the fundamental group that is isomorphic to Z Z for the case of a torus <ref> [1] </ref>. Thus, there are infinitely many loop types, each of which can be indexed as (i; j), where i and j are integers indicating how many times the loop winds the torus longitudinally and meridianally, respectively (Fig. 2). <p> Suppose a meridianal loop (i.e., of type (0,1)) is found. We parametrize the meridianal loop by t 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref>, so that (0) = (1), where (t) represents a path. We cut the torus along and unfold it (Fig. 5).

Reference-contexts: After cutting the torus into two parts, we can recursively divide each part until each component becomes tractable. 5. Concluding Remarks In this note, we have shown a procedure to establish a homeomorphism between toroidal surfaces. Most related work considers homeomorphisms for simpler shapes such as polygons <ref> [3, 2] </ref>, while our method is characterized as analyzing intrinsic topological structures of the torus. We mention a few possible directions of future work. * Homeomorphism and deformation It is possible that two spaces are homeomorphic, yet no stretching or twisting can deform one to the other.

Reference-contexts: The correspondence problem requires that a homeomorphism be established between the two shapes. For objects with genus 0, the surfaces of the initial and target shapes are both recursively decomposed into two disjoint sheets in tandem until pairs of sheets are sufficiently simple to be mapped with each other <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> The process can be repeated until sheets are simple enough, at which point direct mapping can be established. An approach for the case of sphere is described in detail in <ref> [4] </ref>. 4.3 Generalization Now we sketch how the above algorithm may be generalized to handle a sphere with multiple handles.
