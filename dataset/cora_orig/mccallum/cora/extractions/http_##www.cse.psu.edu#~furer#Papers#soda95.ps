Abstract: The classical polynomial time graph isomor-phism test of Babai, Grigoriev and Mount for graphs of bounded eigenvalue multiplicity consists of two distinct parts. First, in the linear algebra part, numerical approximations of all eigen-values and projections of the basis vectors into the eigenspaces are computed. The precision has to be chosen carefully to ensure that it is decidable whether two such projections are equal or have equal length. Also equal angles between such projections have to be recognized. In a second combinatorial and group theoretical part, this information is used to try isomorphisms in the projections and either to combine them to a global isomor-phism or to detect that none exists.

Indeed, the known polynomial time graph iso-morphism test of Babai, Grigoriev and Mount <ref> [2] </ref> for graphs of bounded eigenvalue multiplicity has a very different flavor than any other classical graph isomorphism test. To solve this discrete combinatorial problem, it involves numerical computations of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. <p> In addition, if C uv has any other color class, then such an eigenspace S can be chosen such that not every vertex has the same projection. This allows our algorithm to partition the equally colored vertices very much the same way as done by Babai, Grigoriev, and Mount <ref> [2] </ref>, even though, we have no handle on the eigenspaces themselves and cannot characterize which eigenspace has produced a partition. 4 The Algorithm The new algorithm starts by producing a canonical stable vertex coloring C from scratch and also for each vertex v a canonical stable vertex coloring C v with <p> The finer partitioning is indeed produced by reclassifying vertices according to the projection on its eigenspace. Therefore, as in the previous algorithm of Babai, Grigoriev, and Mount <ref> [2] </ref>, there are only polynomi 8 F urer ally many possibilities to try to extend any single automorphism of the upper parts of the tree to include the new layer. A crucial observation is how to extend these automorphisms.

A crucial observation is how to extend these automorphisms. Babai, Grigoriev, and Mount [2] have used vector space considerations. The automorphism has to be a linear mapping and is therefore defined by its images on a basis. We have not identified the projections onto these eigenspaces numerically. Instead we extend the automorphism based on Theorem 3.4. <p> Instead we extend the automorphism based on Theorem 3.4. Therefore, whenever the image of some projections has been selected, the images of linearly dependent projections are uniquely determined by the edge colors.

Initially all vertices have the same color. During a refinement step, two vertices of the same old color receive different new colors, if they differ in the number of adjacent vertices of any old color.
