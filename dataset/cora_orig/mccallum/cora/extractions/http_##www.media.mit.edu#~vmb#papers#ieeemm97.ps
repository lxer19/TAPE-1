Abstract: Responsive multimedia refers to a melding of media forms that has the ability to react in some way to audience identity, circumstances, equipment, and actions. Cutting-edge responsive multimedia works often involve a collaboration among many people of varying expertise and require innovation at many levels, from the incorporation of a new sensor or display technology to the structuring of media objects and their behaviors. Tools should therefore be designed to support the multi-level nature of such projects, in terms of both authoring and user-base. In this article we present a scripting environment designed with this goal in mind and our experiences using it to develop several major multimedia prototypes ranging from interactive stories to live communication systems.

Reference-contexts: While other researchers have presented videoconferences in which all participants appear in the same window [4][5], and the idea of automatically identifying the "center of attention" in a multipoint videoconference can be traced back at least 25 years <ref> [6] </ref>, this system is novel in that it is implemented totally as a set of cooperating scripts, enabling rapid experimental changes in the behavior of the prototype, and allowing video and audio each to affect the presentation of the other in useful ways.

Reference-contexts: levels of technological expertise. 9 (set factorial (proc (x) (if (= x 0) (* x (factorial (- x 1)))))) To date, we have ported Isis to a variety of UNIX systems, as well as to one non-standard platform (the Magic7 operating system on the Media Laboratory's Cheops hybrid data-flow processor <ref> [7] </ref>). In this section, we outline the concerns taken into account in the design of Isis core scripting language and highlight some of the multi-level tools we have built inside of it.

Reference-contexts: At the highest level of image manipulation is Amazon, a package of scripted objects for handling complex compositions of images and video. This system provides satisfactory support for experiments in the use of model-based representations as the basis for responsive media <ref> [8] </ref>, which was one of our main reasons for developing Isis in the first place. In Amazon, the author may place any number of visual media "actors" in a three-dimensional space along with a "camera" that represents the viewer.

Reference-contexts: Moving to different digitizing hardware would mean adding new low-level drivers, but the high-level objects could remain the same. We have also developed objects for controlling some unusual input devices, including several that were developed at our laboratory which include sonar, radar, and electric field sensors <ref> [10] </ref>. Midi translators and other devices using serial port communication may be accessed using the built-in file I/O primitives. 5 The projects revisited In both The Museum and Wallpaper, high-level Amazon scripts were used to establish the framework of visual and auditory media actors of which these productions are composed.
