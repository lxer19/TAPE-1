Abstract: Current approaches to supporting real-time communication allocate network resources either to individual connections, or to aggregates of connections, based on type of traffic, protocol, or performance requirements. The first approach provides well-defined performance guarantees that are independent of other network traffic. The second approach may achieve higher utilization of network resources, but the expected performance is less well-defined since it is dependent on the behavior of unrelated (possibly unknown) connections. We previously presented resource sharing , a new approach that exploits known relationships between related connections to allow network resources to be shared without sacrificing well-defined guarantees. Resource sharing is very important for large conferences with a bounded number of concurrent speakers, resource requirements do not increase with the number of potential speakers. In this paper, we evaluate resource sharing benefits by analysis and by simulation. Results show that resource sharing leads to a large gain in the connection acceptance rate, and a significant reduction in the computational overhead associated with admission control.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many classes of applications, including distributed multimedia group communication [12] and traditional distributed processing, require or benefit from a network communication service that provides well-defined performance guarantees. A number of protocols and schemes have been proposed to provide real-time communication services <ref> [3, 5] </ref>. These schemes are usually connection-oriented, in that they allocate network resources (e.g., bandwidth, buffers, etc.) along the path data packets will travel. <p> One technique to improve utilization (and hence the connection acceptance rate) is to measure the actual traffic characterization of individual connections and to modify the connection traffic characterization dynamically [14]. Another technique uses performance measurements over aggregations of connections to predict future performance <ref> [3] </ref>. The first approach still over-estimates aggregate resource requirements, since it fails to capture the important relationships between connections (e.g. in a conference, usually only one speaker is active at a time).

Reference-contexts: A number of protocols and schemes have been proposed to provide real-time communication services [3, 5]. These schemes are usually connection-oriented, in that they allocate network resources (e.g., bandwidth, buffers, etc.) along the path data packets will travel. Traditional real-time network systems (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>) may over-allocate resources for two reasons: (1) they allocate resources based on a worst-case prediction of the actual traffic; and (2) they treat traffic on different connections independently when determining their resource requirements. <p> paper with suggestions for future work in Section 7. 2 Background In this section, we provide a very brief introduction to resource sharing in the context of the Tenet protocols; interested readers can find more information on resource sharing in [8], and a detailed overview of the Tenet protocols in <ref> [4, 10] </ref>. In the second generation of the Tenet protocols [7], the basic abstraction is the multicast real-time channel|a simplex, one-to-many connection at the network-layer.

These schemes are usually connection-oriented, in that they allocate network resources (e.g., bandwidth, buffers, etc.) along the path data packets will travel. <p> In addition, we are also interested in the timeliness and computational cost of channel establishment, for which we use a different metric: the computational overhead associated with admission control. In the simulations, we use the admission control tests for the EDD scheduling discipline <ref> [5] </ref>. The time complexity of these tests at a given node is O (n), where n is the number of accepted reservations at that node.

Reference-contexts: In addition, when measurements are not available (e.g. when a connection is first established), this approach must fall back to use independent traffic characterizations, as in the first approach. In previous work <ref> [8] </ref>, we proposed resource sharing as a "middle ground", by which related connections can share resource allocations in a controlled manner, so that network utilization is improved and performance guarantees of established connections are achieved. <p> We have organized this paper in the following manner. Section 2 provides a brief description of the resource sharing techniques that we evaluate in this paper; the readers should read <ref> [8] </ref> for a complete description of the resource sharing technique. We provide analytical bounds on resource sharing benefits in Section 3, and describe the results of our simulation experiments in Section 4.

Reference-contexts: Since many data streams cannot be scaled arbitrarily without serious degradation in perceived quality (e.g. [13] ), we argue that the source should specify the resource requirements (at least in terms of bandwidth). Receiver control over bandwidth requirements can be obtained by using layered coding schemes <ref> [11] </ref> and putting each layer in a separate sharing group. This approach will be studied in future work. 7 Conclusions and suggestions for future work We have presented a scheme for resource sharing for guaranteed performance connections in computer networks. The scheme provides fully-distributed low-overhead techniques for implementing resource sharing.

Pasquale et al.have proposed a stream filter that is "... an executable module which may be placed on a port, and implements a function which takes a specific set 18 of streams associated with that port and produces a new stream" [15]. These filters perform an application-level transformation of one or more streams. A multiplexing filter could perform a function similar to the resource sharing mechanisms described in this paper by taking in streams from upstream nodes and multiplexing them on to a single output stream.
