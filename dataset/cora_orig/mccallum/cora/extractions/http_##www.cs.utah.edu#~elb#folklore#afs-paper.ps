Abstract: The computer hacker has been depicted in the popular press as a socially maladjusted teenager whose goal is to wreak malicious havoc on unsuspecting computer users. In the culture of the computer programmer however, the hacker takes on a far different aspect. The true hacker is raised to heroic status with tales of amazing feats circulated through computer networks in the form of stories and legends. In this paper I discuss the persona of the true hacker, illustrated using hacker legends collected from the Internet.

Reference-contexts: The theme of the hackers surpassing the designer by extending things in ways that were never imagined must surely have parallels to other legends in other cultures. Another legend about doing the impossible is told about third-wave Apple hacker Andy Hertzfeld. According to Byte Magazine <ref> [1] </ref>: Besides everything else he did to help get the first Macintosh out the door, Andy Hertzfeld wrote all the first desk accessories. Most of these were written in assembly.

Reference-contexts: For a biblical-style account of its development, see <ref> [3] </ref> 7 Another legend about the magical aspects of hacking, this one about hacking hardware rather than software, is told about a machine at MIT [9, 7]. In this legend the storyteller comes across a mysterious switch on the side of the MIT AI Lab's PDP-10 computer.

Reference-contexts: To the working programmer, the term hacker is much more likely to be used as a term of respect for another's programming abilities than as an insult. A well-known on-line lexicon of programming terminology, known as either The Jargon File or The Hacker's Dictionary <ref> [6] </ref>, defines a hacker as: hacker n. [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] 1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. 2. <p> In the case of the hacker the virtue, the moral code, is embodied in the Hacker Ethic. The Hacker Ethic is essentially that information should be freely available to individuals who seek to understand the details of any system. The Jargon File <ref> [6] </ref> defines the Hacker Ethic as: Hacker Ethic, the n. 1.

Reference-contexts: For a biblical-style account of its development, see [3] 7 Another legend about the magical aspects of hacking, this one about hacking hardware rather than software, is told about a machine at MIT <ref> [9, 7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Both of these examples are related to the early examples of hacker culture, but the railroad example is of particular importance. The first computer hackers are generally agreed to have been students at MIT in the 1950's who were part of the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) <ref> [8] </ref>. This club had (and probably still has) a huge model train layout that was the focus of the club activities. The subcommittee of the club responsible for the complicated wiring of the switches that controlled where 2 the trains went were hackers waiting to happen.

Reference-contexts: It is a story of this type that I offer as an example of one of the most well known hacker legends. It is called The Story of Mel, A Real Programmer <ref> [10] </ref>. I first saw this story in 1984 when it was sent to me through email while I was a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University.
Reference: [11] <author> Ed Post. </author> <title> Real programmers don't use pascal. </title> <journal> Datamation, </journal> <year> 1983. </year>
Reference-contexts: The actual article to which The Story of Mel refers is one published in the computer magazine Datamation in 1983 entitled Real Programmers Don't Use Pascal by Ed Post <ref> [11] </ref>. Pascal is a computer language designed by Nicklaus Wirth to promote so-called structured programming, which forces the programmer into a logical system structure the makes the program easier to understand and debug [16].

Reference-contexts: When the SAIL machine was finally shut down in 1991, hackers sent an email goodbye message to Internet as if the SAIL machine was itself sending a last farewell to its friends <ref> [12] </ref>. Even commercial research centers were home to hackers. ATT, Xerox, and others all had programmers of legendary skill working for them. Legendary hackers from this second wave of activity include Ed Fredkin, Brian Reid, Jim Gosling, Brian Kernighan, Dennis Ritchie, and Richard Stallman.

Reference-contexts: The legendary status of Mel is seen, for example, in another hacker legend from the Internet, this one about the problems of making code fit into the guidance computer of a satellite before lift-off <ref> [13] </ref>. The story ends with the following summation: The solution was both clever and bletcherous. The overflow bit became part of the opcode. To get the extra opcodes, the program would add-to-memory an accumulator value that would cause an overflow when added to the instruction that was in memory.

Reference-contexts: Emacs is distributed free of charge by the organization founded by RMS called GNU and includes a novel licensing agreement called the GNU General Public License or the copyleft agreement <ref> [14] </ref>. The copyleft agreement says that by using the Emacs program you agree to share what you do with other hackers.

Reference-contexts: The copyleft agreement says that by using the Emacs program you agree to share what you do with other hackers. According to RMS <ref> [15] </ref>: The legal meaning of the GNU copyleft is less important than the spirit, which is that Emacs is a free software project and that work pertaining to Emacs should also be free software. Free means that all users have the freedom to study, share, change, and improve Emacs.

Reference-contexts: Pascal is a computer language designed by Nicklaus Wirth to promote so-called structured programming, which forces the programmer into a logical system structure the makes the program easier to understand and debug <ref> [16] </ref>. FORTRAN is a computer programming language designed for engineering and scientific code, and is one of the, if not the, oldest computer language still in wide use today.
