Abstract: We propose a new objective function for the image reconstruction problem, where the image is comprised of piecewise smooth regions separated by sharp boundaries. We use alternating minimization to minimize our objective function. We use the level set technique to minimize with regard to the boudary. The advantage of this new approach is shown through the bias/variance analysis of a hot spot.

Reference-contexts: To avoid smoothing of edges, which are important attributes of the image, various edge-preserving regularization schemes have been proposed. Most of these schemes rely on information from a local neighbourhood to determine the existence of edges, e.g., <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]. In this paper, we propose an objective function that incorporates nonlocal boundary information into regularization. We use an alternating minimization scheme that partly uses recent advances in level set techniques in the field of image segmentation [3] [4].

However, the regularization in equation (2) is only local; there is no global structure in the regularization, so it is plausible that the regularization described in equation (2) is suboptimal.
