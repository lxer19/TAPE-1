Abstract: Panel Report: The Potential of Geons for Generic 3-D Object Abstract Biederman's introduction of geons to the vision community has spawned considerable interest in building geon-based vision systems. However, numerous issues must be addressed before such systems can make a practical contribution to machine vision. At IJCAI, 1993, a group of distinguished researchers, each of whom has worked with geon-based recognition, was brought together to form a panel whose goal was to identify and discuss these issues. This paper is based on that panel discussion.

Reference-contexts: Parallel architectures and algorithms are necessary to cope with the combinatorial complexity arising from manipulating sets of features. The implemented processes in PARVO were all designed with this constraint in mind. 5 2.3 Grouping and MAGNO My recent research <ref> [1] </ref> on these topics has focused on the problem of deriving more efficient and robust contour grouping processes. Such processes, operating at multiple scales, are meant to rapidly identify significant structured subsets of contour elements in an intensity image of a complex scene.

The principal problems with this approach seem to be the difficulty in extracting sufficiently good line drawings, and the idealized nature of the geon representation.

These representations, whether derived from intensity or range images, could then be used for 3D object recognition <ref> [50, 4, 28] </ref>. The information offered by geons is only qualitative in nature. Therefore, geons are not adequate for describing and discriminating objects which are similar in their coarse part structure (e.g., sculpted or free-form objects).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In 1985, Biederman introduced to the computer vision community a theory of human visual object recognition called Recognition by Components (RBC) <ref> [5] </ref>. The main tenets of RBC, supported by psychophysical experiments [9, 11], are that: (i) the basic-level representation recovered from an image during primal access is metrically invariant, i.e., invariant to scale, translation, or orientation in depth, and (ii) the basic-level representation is composed of parts and their interrelations. <p> Moreover, because such descriptions are often not unique, it is unclear how they aid in object recognition. 17 About 1985, these problems with G.C. representations began to be taken seriously, and two different proposals arose to deal with them. One variation on the G.C. idea is due to Biederman <ref> [5] </ref>, who suggested using the Cartesian product of qualitative properties such as tapering, cross-section, etc., in order to create a qualitative taxonomy of G.C. One advantage of this type of representation, called geons, is that the properties can be chosen to be ones that are more easily recovered from imagery.

Geon theory offers an account of real-time entry-level shape classification by humans-what Bie-derman <ref> [6] </ref> referred to as "primal access." It will be helpful to consider what geon theory is not, as this has been the source of some misdirected commentary, e.g., [41, 43]. Geon theory is not a full graphics system. <p> Biological vision thus furnishes an existence proof and, therefore, an inspiration to attempts at achieving edge extraction by machines. From this perspective, the appeal to stereo and motion by the "active vision" community represents a premature admission of defeat. 3.2 Empirical Results 3.2.1 Is recognition part-based? <ref> [6] </ref> showed that recognition is impossible (median accuracy 0%) if contour is deleted from an image of an object such that the part structure cannot be recovered. <p> However, I also think that the technique must be applied in a context where the issues I've listed, and also other problems, can be addressed appropriately. 5 Geon-based recognition of 3D objects Anil K. Jain Michigan State University Recognition by components (RBC) theory, proposed by Biederman <ref> [6] </ref>, offers an explanation of human object recognition supported by several psychophysical studies. It maintains that a 3D object is decomposed into qualitative volumetric part-based primitives, called geons, at the concavities of an object.

In contrast to sets of objects that are not distinguished by geon differences, <ref> [11] </ref> showed that objects that differ in geons are recognized with little or no cost from rotation in depth, as long as the same part and relations were in view.

Reference-contexts: But, as predicted by geon theory, differences between such shape variations are not readily employed by people in real-time classification, nor are they treated as invariant under depth rotation, nor do they form the basis of any spontaneous classification in any culture <ref> [12, 18] </ref>. <p> that we require its exact shape to achieve classification, nor would we be able to readily distinguish that tree from others at a new orientation in depth, nor 7 would we even think about the differences between that tree and other oak trees as the basis of a useful class <ref> [10, 12] </ref>.

One kind of these classifications is where large geon differences exist, such as that between a round table and a square table.

While many psychological results directly support the general principles <ref> [6, 9, 13] </ref>, the computational hypotheses are more like extrapolations or predictions regarding an actual implementation. <p> Indeed, for multipart objects, there is virtually no difference in identification performance between full color slides and line drawings <ref> [13] </ref>. Although people evidence little difficulty in determining these discontinuities from a gray level image of unfamiliar objects, extraction of these discontinuities remains a daunting challenge to most computer vision systems. Biological vision thus furnishes an existence proof and, therefore, an inspiration to attempts at achieving edge extraction by machines.

Reference-contexts: mechanisms of contour binding and geon activation be completed quickly enough to account for 100 msec recognition times? An elaboration of JIM by [38] posits that an unbound representation of the image might be classified in 100 msec, but the binding necessary for invariance and memory might require 300-700 msec; <ref> [14] </ref> presents evidence for this possibility. 3.4.3 Irregular objects As noted earlier, geon representations are not suitable for representing objects that do not readily decompose into simple parts or are highly irregular.

Reference-contexts: It is absolutely clear, therefore, that part representations are excellent for many computational and cognitive tasks. What is not so clear is how they might be useful in computer vision. The first parts representation was suggested by Binford <ref> [15] </ref>; this is the idea of generalized cylinders (G.C.). Because of the relatively unconstrained nature of this representation, the recovery process seems to require elaborate line grouping and reasoning. Consequently there are relatively few reports of recovering such descriptions from real imagery.

The unit represents a structural description (geons + relations) of the object.

A possible benefit from employing a neural network representation is that it can offer some capacity for achieving recognition (through partial activation) in the face of the ambiguity often inherent in images of such objects.

Reference-contexts: Given our goal of recovering the aspects corresponding to an object's volumetric parts, how do we proceed to recover these aspects? From our analysis, we discovered that image regions, not lines or line groups, were the most appropriate features to extract from an image <ref> [28, 21] </ref>. Image regions not only provide a natural grouping of image contours, i.e., the bounding contours of a region, but region shape provides a powerful inferencing mechanism for aspect, and hence, volume recovery. <p> The child interacts with the system by instructing it to find and manipulate toys on a table (top-down recognition) <ref> [21] </ref>; hence, we need object identification, object localization, and metric shape recovery (for gripping) [24, 25, 23].

Reference-contexts: I speculate that the most successful systems will employ first a qualitative pruning/grouping stage to perform segmentation, and then a parametric fitting stage to extract detailed part shape. This approach was recently successfully employed in <ref> [23] </ref>. A final question is representational adequacy. It seems clear that to model natural objects the G.C. representation must be augmented by a displacement map as in [52].

Reference-contexts: Diverging from the analysis of labeled contours, Raja and Jain explored geon recovery from range data [49]. Their technique, which recovers geons from superquadrics fitted to range data, has been successfully tested on range images of real geon-based objects with straight axes. Since then, Dickinson, Metaxas, and Pentland <ref> [24] </ref> and Wu and Levine [54] have also looked at geon-like part extraction from range data. Eklundh and his colleagues are building an active vision system whose goal is to recognize geon-based objects from images acquired by their stereo head [31]. <p> The child interacts with the system by instructing it to find and manipulate toys on a table (top-down recognition) [21]; hence, we need object identification, object localization, and metric shape recovery (for gripping) <ref> [24, 25, 23] </ref>.

These representations, whether derived from intensity or range images, could then be used for 3D object recognition <ref> [50, 4, 28] </ref>. The information offered by geons is only qualitative in nature. Therefore, geons are not adequate for describing and discriminating objects which are similar in their coarse part structure (e.g., sculpted or free-form objects). <p> It is interesting to compare the geon and parametric approaches. Both describe a similar range of shapes; perhaps the major difference is that one is qualitative while the other is quantitative. This similarity has made it possible to generate geon statistics using parametric models <ref> [28] </ref>, and allowed Raja and Jain [49] to use superquadrics to recover geons.

From our analysis, we discovered that image regions, not lines or line groups, were the most appropriate features to extract from an image <ref> [28, 21] </ref>. Image regions not only provide a natural grouping of image contours, i.e., the bounding contours of a region, but region shape provides a powerful inferencing mechanism for aspect, and hence, volume recovery. <p> Alternatively, when the child is idle, the system can build up its database of objects in its domain (bottom-up recognition) <ref> [28, 27] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: While the RBC theory is primarily advanced in the context of extraction of geons from 2D intensity images, similar strategies could be used for extracting geons from 3D (depth, range) data. These representations, whether derived from intensity or range images, could then be used for 3D object recognition <ref> [50, 4, 28] </ref>. The information offered by geons is only qualitative in nature. Therefore, geons are not adequate for describing and discriminating objects which are similar in their coarse part structure (e.g., sculpted or free-form objects). <p> The resultant representations could then be matched using a graph matching algorithm <ref> [50] </ref>. Representation of an arbitrary object in terms of a few generic primitives is an attractive and intuitive idea. However, it appears that much more research is required to establish its feasibility in solving real-world recognition problems.

Reference-contexts: For example, modeling an object's functionality instead of its geometry provides an even more powerful and robust means for modeling particular classes of objects. Reasoning about the shape and interaction of an object's volumetric parts can provide "functional" indices into a database of objects defined by their function <ref> [51] </ref>. 8.3 Representational Power For a vision system to interact with the world requires that it not only identify or recognize the objects that it wishes to interact with, but that it sufficiently localize (in depth) and characterize (in dimension) the objects in order to manipulate them.

Reference-contexts: Similar to geons but with continuous rather than qualitative properties, this type of representation has been successfully used for recognition in segmented data [48], and in modeling complex natural objects <ref> [52] </ref>. In 1991, Munck-Fairwood investigated a logic programming approach to the recovery of geons from a manually segmented line drawing [33]. Recently, he has integrated causal probabilistic networks into his approach, assigning confidence measures to Biederman's dichotomous and trichotomous properties [34]. <p> This approach was recently successfully employed in [23]. A final question is representational adequacy. It seems clear that to model natural objects the G.C. representation must be augmented by a displacement map as in <ref> [52] </ref>. Moreover, the G.C. representations currently used in vision are much simpler than those used in CAD. Consequently, I predict that the more expressive G.C. representations [48][52], will become increasingly popular. 8 The Obstacles Facing Practical Geon-Based Recognition Sven Dickinson Rutgers University I see three major obstacles facing the success of

Reference-contexts: Their technique, which recovers geons from superquadrics fitted to range data, has been successfully tested on range images of real geon-based objects with straight axes. Since then, Dickinson, Metaxas, and Pentland [24] and Wu and Levine <ref> [54] </ref> have also looked at geon-like part extraction from range data. Eklundh and his colleagues are building an active vision system whose goal is to recognize geon-based objects from images acquired by their stereo head [31].

Reference-contexts: One interesting piece of research, in this respect, is the study of quantitative invariant properties of the projected contours of generalized cylinders. Unfortunately, the results of this research are also difficult to apply to intensity images of real scenes comprising complex objects <ref> [55] </ref>. 4 2.2 PARVO In my work with the PARVO (Primal Access Recognition of Visual Objects) system, two main goals were pursued [3, 4]. <p> is accomplished though a classification of texture, position in the scene, or other characteristics. 3.5 Middle-down constraints One advantage of assuming a geon-type of representation is that one can exploit "middle down" properties of generalized cylinders (GCs, of which the geons are a partition) as reported by Zerroug and Nevatia <ref> [55] </ref>. There are a number of regularizing assumptions that people employ in interpreting their visual world. These assumptions include symmetry, parallelism, orthogonality of angles, and the orthogonality of cross sections and axes.
