Abstract: Clustered or hierarchical interconnections demonstrate advantage in designing large scale multiprocessor systems. Earlier studies in literature have either focused on only flat interconnections or proposed hierarchical/clustered interconnections with limited packaging and demanded performance constraints. Large systems require several levels of packaging. Packaging technologies impose various physical constraints on bisection bandwidth and channel width of a system. Pinout technologies and capacity of packaging modules have been ignored in earlier studies, often leading to configurations that are not design-feasible. Similarly, the impact of processor and interconnect technologies on demanded performance has also not been considered. In this paper, we propose a new supply-demand framework for multiprocessor system design by considering packaging, processor, and interconnect technologies in an integrated manner. The elegance of this framework lies in its parameterized representation of different technologies. For a given set of technological parameters the framework derives the best configuration while considering practical design aspects like maximum board area, maximum available pinout, fixed channel width, and scalability. In order to build a scalable parallel system with a given number of processors, the framework explores the design space of flat k-ary n-cube topologies and their clustered variations (k-ary n-cube cluster-c) to derive design-feasible configurations with best system performance. The study identifies processor board area, supported channel width, board pinout density, and router pinout as critical parameters and analyzes their impact on deriving design-feasible and best configurations. For a wide range of parameters, it is shown that best configurations are achieved with cluster-based systems with up to 8 processors per cluster and 3D-5D inter-cluster interconnection.

Reference-contexts: In order to support larger dimensional networks, we need more channels. This leads to thinner channels with a fixed pinout from a board. This observation matches with a similar result shown in <ref> [2] </ref>, [8] while designing flat systems. Similarly, for a given pinout technology and board size, decreasing the 2 Assumption of regular topology wherever made in this section is only for formula simplification and providing a more intuitive understanding of the interplay between various parameters. <p> The Model We develop a simple analytical model to predict performance in (k n ; c) systems with small cluster sizes. This model considers network contention and determines latency and throughput parameters for a given traffic load. Our model is an extension of the model proposed by Agrawal <ref> [2] </ref> to predict performance in flat k-ary n-cube networks with dimension-order [8] virtual cut-through routing. As shown in [2] the average message latency in the presence of contention through a k-ary n-cube network can be derived as: T c = 1 + (1 mF d) d 1 + n nd + <p> This model considers network contention and determines latency and throughput parameters for a given traffic load. Our model is an extension of the model proposed by Agrawal <ref> [2] </ref> to predict performance in flat k-ary n-cube networks with dimension-order [8] virtual cut-through routing. As shown in [2] the average message latency in the presence of contention through a k-ary n-cube network can be derived as: T c = 1 + (1 mF d) d 1 + n nd + F; (11) where T c denotes the average message latency expressed in network cycles. <p> Assuming a clustered system offering small intra-cluster latencies, the average latency seen by a message, T c , is dominated by the average inter-cluster latency. To estimate this factor we modify the model in <ref> [2] </ref> in the following manner. Given the message injection rate from each processor to be m messages/cycle, the combined traffic generated by all the processors in a cluster is mc messages/cycle. Under uniform traffic assumption, most of this traffic is inter-cluster. <p> These values are derived using Eqn. 13. Some of the values for very low radix systems were derived through simulation experiments. This is because Agrawal's model <ref> [2] </ref>, on which our model is based, does not hold for very low radix configurations. The performance plots depicting the average message latency versus average throughput for all feasible configurations to build a N 1024 processor system are shown in Fig. 10. These were obtained through actual simulation experiments.

Reference-contexts: Summary of results The impact of varying other packaging constraints like maximum board size and surface board pinout technology was also considered. These results are available in <ref> [6] </ref>. Based on representative current and expected future technologies our analysis indicated that flat configurations may not be design-feasible under all packaging technologies. On the other hand, clustered configurations demonstrate higher potential in offering design-feasible configurations.

Reference-contexts: In order to support larger dimensional networks, we need more channels. This leads to thinner channels with a fixed pinout from a board. This observation matches with a similar result shown in [2], <ref> [8] </ref> while designing flat systems. Similarly, for a given pinout technology and board size, decreasing the 2 Assumption of regular topology wherever made in this section is only for formula simplification and providing a more intuitive understanding of the interplay between various parameters. <p> However, under surface pinout technology, for any fixed inter-cluster dimensionality it leads to a rise in channel width. B. Supporting a Fixed Inter-Cluster Channel Width Most of the prior studies on system design, while proposing guidelines under different constraints like constant bisection bandwidth <ref> [8] </ref>, did not impose any restrictions on the values that the channel width can take while satisfying other constraints. As discussed in Section V-C supporting an arbitrarily large channel width is difficult. <p> As discussed earlier in Section III-A the bisection size of the inter-cluster network B, or more specifically bisection size per processor B=N , is indicative of the supportable average throughput per processor in the system <ref> [8] </ref>. Observations derived in this subsection for the bisection size per processor reflect similar trends on system throughput. These observations are expected to be broad guidelines to aid the design decision process. A more accurate modeling of the average throughput in presence of contention is presented in the next section. <p> This model considers network contention and determines latency and throughput parameters for a given traffic load. Our model is an extension of the model proposed by Agrawal [2] to predict performance in flat k-ary n-cube networks with dimension-order <ref> [8] </ref> virtual cut-through routing.
