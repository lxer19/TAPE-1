Title: Using J'n'J in Unix/X Jape  
Author: Bernard Sufrin Richard Bornat 
Date: November 4, 1996  
Abstract: In this note we describe, by means of a number of case studies, the user interface to the Jape implementation - "J'n'J" of the logic described in [7] ("the book"). The introduction is intended for someone who may not have used Jape before. It assumes the reader has a basic grasp of the Unix operating system and the X window system and has read section 1 of [5] which is a companion to this note..

Reference-contexts: Jape is a work-in-progress, so there may be slight inconsistencies between different accounts of it. * Richard Bornat's note describing a Jape implementation of a slightly different natural-deduction-style logic is available on the net <ref> [1] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This is recommended for those who want to learn more about using Jape to do natural deduction proofs, and who wish to see more detailed explanations of the way in which some of the rules can be used from Jape. * Our note <ref> [2] </ref> describing how to make your own Jape logic by taking the reader through several of the example theories we issue with Jape. * The directories /prg/pl/jape/EXAMPLES*/ at your installation contain example theories which you may wish to play with. * There are Jape Web sites at Oxford [3] and QMW

Reference-contexts: The lemma yields to an invocation of [)-intro] 16 4 : -intro 2-3 3 : p hypothesis 1 2 : q assumption 1 : p assumption qp The hypothesis rule used to generate line 3 is discussed at length in section 2 of <ref> [5] </ref>, and its automatic application is discussed later in that note. If we register this proof by pressing Edit/Done then the proof we were working on reappears. The second lemma doesn't appear on the conjectures list. We can add it to that list by pressing (New) on the conjectures panel. <p> This invokes a command which is not a formal proof rule, but which by attempting to unify the terms which are text-selected, may resolve one or more unknowns to the point where the automatic application of hypothesis (which J'n'J does after every command: see Section 4.1 of <ref> [5] </ref>) can finish the proof. Now that we have seen how to provide parameters to rules, we will go back and re-do the proof this time without inventing the y on the first step.
