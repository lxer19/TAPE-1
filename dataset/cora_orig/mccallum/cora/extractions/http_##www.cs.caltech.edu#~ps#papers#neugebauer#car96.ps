Title: Generating CAD-models of teeth

Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for the reconstruction of teeth model. Therefore, a tooth model has to be scanned from several directions with a 3D-laser scanner. Several views are necessary because of shadows and occluded areas in the range images. Then, all acquired range views are combined to build a CAD-model of the tooth. The idea is that every part of the surface should be visible in at least one view. The reconstruction process is divided into the steps registration, volume sculpturing and generation of an accurate polygonal representation.

Reference-contexts: Thus, several unregistered range images showing only partial views of the object must be combined to generate a complete geometrical model <ref> [1] </ref> [4] [2] [8]. The processing pipeline is shown in figure 1. After registration of all range images a sculpturing algorithm carves out a rough volumetric model of the tooth. The volumetric model accelerates the reconstruction process and allows the reconstruction of objects without topological constraints.

Reference-contexts: With at least three corresponding points between the new image and all previously integrated images the rough relative orientation between the new image and the world coordinate system is defined. The detection of the relative orientation with this approach is described in <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.2. Improvement of the Relative Orientations The rough estimate of the relative orientation must be improved to obtain the necessary accuracy. In our approach, the registration of multiple range images is considered as a minimization problem.

Reference-contexts: After this carving step, a first approximation of the reconstructed object is represented by a volumetric model. 3.4. 3D-Resampling and Improving the Mesh The well known marching cube algorithm <ref> [6] </ref> (see figure 2) is applied on the volumetric model to generate a polygonal representation. The accuracy of this polygonal mesh is improved by moving its vertices exactly on the surface of the object. This step is similar to a ray casting algorithm.

" 2 = min k1 X D (T ffi T t S k ; T i S i ) (3) Now, the initial problem is reduced to a least-squares problem which can be solved with the Levenberg-Marquard algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>. Clearly, the solution cannot be computed exactly within one step because of the necessary linearization. Thus, the efficiency of the procedure is improved by applying a resolution hierarchy.

Reference-contexts: Our idea is that a well-shaped model from the knowledge base can be adapted automatically to the chair-side generated optical impression. Then, the system will know about the shape of the occlusal surface. This will be extremely useful to guide segmentation procedures like the contour tracing algorithm presented in <ref> [9] </ref>. We start the reconstruction process with a conventional model of a tooth containing any defects. The tooth is scanned from several directions with a 3D-laser scanner. Scanners providing range images are able to scan the shape of an object from one view.
