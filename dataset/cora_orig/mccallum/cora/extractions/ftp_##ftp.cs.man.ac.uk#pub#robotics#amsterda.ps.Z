Title: Really Useful Robots  
Author: U. Nehmzow, J. Hallam, T. Smithers 
Affiliation: Department of Artificial Intelligence Edinburgh University  
Abstract: We propose a self-organizing type of controller for a mobile robot. Rather than decompose the control task into subtasks and implement these (an analytic approach) we propose to use competence generators which generate, through a process of self-organization, the necessary competences (a synthetic approach). We have built a mobile robot and equipped it with a first version of such a self-organizing controller.

In a spatial sense Luc Steels has worked on the first question. His Reaction Dif--fusion Dynamics <ref> [3] </ref> show intelligent overall behaviour (determining the shortest path between two points on a map, regardless of obstacles), although only local actions are defined (the physics of diffusion).

Reference-contexts: These have been proposed by various workers (e.g. Willshaw and von der Malsburg [4,5] to account for the autogenesis of topographic mappings in the nervous system). The system we have used shows properties of both Kohonen's self-organizing net [7] and Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams' back propagation network <ref> [6] </ref>. Therefore we will describe these systems first. Kohonen's [7] self-organizing system consists of a two-dimensional array of cells which all receive the same input, the input vector ~-. <p> In this sense Kohonen's system is a linear system. Non-linear systems might also be interesting for our purposes (see section 4 of this paper). The classical non-linear neural net, as described for example by Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams <ref> [6] </ref> (see figure 2), consists of a layer of input units, a layer of hidden units and one of output units.

Reference-contexts: At this point a generate-and-test procedure is used, similar to the `associative search' of Barto and Sutton <ref> [8] </ref>. A random move out of either the whole set of possible motor actions or a restricted set of motor actions is selected. This move is then performed for a period of time.
