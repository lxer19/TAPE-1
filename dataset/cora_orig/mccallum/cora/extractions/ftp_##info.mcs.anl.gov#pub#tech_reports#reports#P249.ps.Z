Abstract: Numerical results from a parallel implementation of an iterative substructuring algorithm are reported. The algorithm is for solving scalar, self-adjoint elliptic partial differential equations in three dimensions. Results are given for two variants of the algorithm. In the first variant, exact interior solvers are used; in the second, one multigrid V-cycle is used to approximately solve the interior problems. The results are compared to theoretical behavior of the algorithm reported in previous work.

Reference-contexts: Any good iterative substructuring algorithm with exact interior solvers can be reformulated to use approximate interior solvers. This approach has been analyzed with some success in Borgers <ref> [3] </ref> and Haase, Langer, and Meyer [13]. In this paper we report on experiments in which both approximate and exact interior solvers are used. We use multigrid for the approximate interior solver in our experiments. This paper is organized as follows. <p> For the preconditioner labeled B G A we have used one multigrid V-cycle to solve the subdomain problems approximately. The difference in the condition number between using one multigrid V-cycle, two multigrid V-cycles, and an exact interior solver is very small. Similar results have previously been noted by Borgers <ref> [3] </ref> and Haase, Langer, and Meyer [13] for problems in two dimensions but have they not yet been fully explained theoretically. 9 Table 3 Growth in condition numbers for 64 subdomains (H = 1=4) H=h Unknowns K S B 1 G S B 1 D S B 1 4 3,375 103

E-mail: bsmith@mcs.anl.gov. <p> This method may be needed for extremely ill-conditioned problems where no good substitutes exist. 2. We can use a suitable scaling of the J operator. The J operator is the square root of the two-dimensional discrete Laplacian on a regular, rectangular mesh. See Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz <ref> [4] </ref> for a discussion of why this leads to good results. It has been shown that J is spectrally equivalent to the explicit block of the Schur complement. It is computationally cheap to apply the action of J 1 to a vector. <p> A Comparison with a Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz Algorithm. Since our basic algorithm is similar to one of the important algorithms introduced by Bramble, Pasciak, and Schatz <ref> [4] </ref>, we have reproduced the experiments reported in their paper using the preconditioner B 1 G : The first set of experiments is for a unit cube divided into eight subcubes. The stiffness matrix is derived from the usual finite dif ference discretization for the Laplace operator. <p> The stiffness matrix is derived from the usual finite dif ference discretization for the Laplace operator. The second problem is for a unit cube divided in 27 subcubes with a different constant coefficient on each subcube; see <ref> [4] </ref> for the values used. We see from Tables 5 and 6 that for this class of problem, the two preconditioners produce similar condition numbers. We note that these are relatively small problems and that diagonal scaling also works well.

Reference-contexts: It does not, however, adapt to the particular partial differential equation. 3. For constant-coefficient elliptic partial differential equations on rectangular sub-domains with a uniform finite difference mesh, we can exactly diagonalize the Schur complement associated with a face, using fast sine transforms. For two dimensions, Chan and Hou <ref> [5] </ref> have proposed the use of this fast spectral decomposition to approximate the actual Schur complement. This approach could be extended to three dimensions. Again, as with the J operator, this requires that we use a regular, rectangular mesh on brick-shaped subdomains. 4. We could use a multilevel preconditioner.

The particular implementation of the algorithm introduced above is closely related to the work of Keyes and Gropp <ref> [14] </ref> for problems in two dimensions. Keyes and Gropp subdivide the domain into rectangular tiles. Each tile is then discretized by using a regular mesh. This is a very natural approach combining flexibility of the domain with regular subdomains and the possibility of local uniform mesh refinement.
