Abstract: Bandwidth smoothing techniques are effective at reducing the burstiness of a compressed, pre-recorded video stream by prefetching frames into the client playback buffer in advance of each burst. In contrast to stored video, live applications typically have limited knowledge of frame sizes and often require bounds on the delay between the source and the client(s). This paper addresses bandwidth smoothing for a growing number of live video applications, such as videocasts of courses or television news, where many clients may be willing to tolerate a playback delay of several seconds or minutes in exchange for a smaller throughput requirement. Extending techniques for smoothing pre-recorded video, we develop online, window-based smoothing algorithms for these delay-tolerant applications. Experiments with MPEG traces demonstrate that the new algorithms significantly reduce the peak rate, coefficient of variation, and effective bandwidth of variable-bit-rate video streams using fairly small window sizes (1-10 seconds), closely approximating the performance of the optimal o*ine algorithm [1].

Reference-contexts: To reduce the burstiness and the peak bandwidth requirements, a multimedia source can smooth the outgoing stream by transmitting a sequence of video frames at an average rate. Recently, several bandwidth smoothing techniques have been introduced that reduce the server and network resource requirements for transmitting pre-recorded video <ref> [1, 7-10] </ref>. By capitalizing on prior knowledge of the frame sizes for the entire video, these techniques can smooth traffic on a large time scale by prefetching frames into a buffer in advance of bursts of large frames. <p> Starting each new run at the leftmost point along the frontier results in a transmission schedule that minimizes the peak and variability of the rates fc i g, as well as the video's effective bandwidth requirement <ref> [1] </ref>. This optimal o*ine algorithm has O (N ) complexity [1] and serves as our starting point for developing effective techniques for online smoothing of live video. <p> Starting each new run at the leftmost point along the frontier results in a transmission schedule that minimizes the peak and variability of the rates fc i g, as well as the video's effective bandwidth requirement <ref> [1] </ref>. This optimal o*ine algorithm has O (N ) complexity [1] and serves as our starting point for developing effective techniques for online smoothing of live video. In the next section, we extend the algorithm to operate on a window of W video frames by modifying the smoothing constraints L and U . <p> If the first I frame is large, the hopping-window smoothing schemes can incorporate a modest amount of extra playback delay to amortize the cost of transmitting this frame. The baseline hopping-window algorithm, called BASE , simply applies the o*ine smoothing algorithm <ref> [1] </ref> on consecutive segments of the video stream.

Reference-contexts: These algorithms, given a fixed-sized client buffer, can minimize the peak bandwidth of the video stream, while also optimizing other important performance metrics <ref> [11] </ref>. In contrast, interactive video applications, such as video conferencing, typically have limited knowledge of frame sizes and require strict bounds on the delay between the server and the client (s). <p> a larger client prefetch buffer, the server can further reduce the peak and variability of the rates c i , as well as the number of bandwidth runs M . 2.2 Computing Transmission Schedules The constraints L and U typically result in multiple feasible transmission schedules with different performance properties <ref> [11] </ref>. For example, Figure 1 (a) shows a plan with M = 3 runs, where the second run increases the transmission rate to avoid an eventual buffer underflow at the client prefetch buffer; similarly, the third run decreases the rate to prevent overflow.

Reference-contexts: For example, the server can smooth the video on a small time scale by transmitting at an average rate for a small set of frames, based on the lengths of existing frames and estimates of future frame sizes <ref> [12, 13] </ref>. Such smoothing is especially effective at removing the short-term burstiness in live MPEG video, where a small group of pictures may have widely different frame lengths.
