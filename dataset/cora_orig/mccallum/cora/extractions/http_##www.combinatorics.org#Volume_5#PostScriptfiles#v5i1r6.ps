Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Merge permutations, permutations which are the union of two increasing subsequences, have been studied for many years <ref> [3] </ref>. It is known that they are characterised by the property of having no decreasing subsequence of length 3 and that there are 2n =(n + 1) such permutations of length n. <p> It follows that the pair of Young tableaux which correspond, in the Robinson-Schensted correspondence, to are shaped like the one shown in Figure 3. Conversely, every such pair of Young tableaux corresponds to a skew-merged permutation with at least one white point. By the hook formula <ref> [3] </ref> x5.1.4, the number of such tableaux with exactly r cells in the first row is n! = n 1 and hence the number of tableaux pairs is n X r 1 = 2n 2 Note that skew-merged permutations with no white points correspond to Young tableau pairs with a shape

Reference-contexts: Recently there has been some interest in permutations which are the union of an increasing subsequence with a decreasing subsequence. We call such permutations skew-merged. Stankova <ref> [4] </ref> proved that a permutation is skew-merged if and only if it has no subsequence abcd ordered in the same way as 2143 or 3412.
