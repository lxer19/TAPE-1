Title: BibSearch: A Multi-Agent Bibliographic Searcher System  
Author: Chi Keen Low 
Date: August 1997  
Address: Melbourne, Victoria, Australia  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Melbourne  
Abstract: BibSearch is a multi-agent system which searches for full bibliographic references in the World Wide Web. It has concurrent agents specialising in certain domains. Each agent examines the information in its domain and presents only the full bibliographic reference. This eliminates the need to click on links to search a web page for references. Manually loading web pages can take a long time if they contain non-textual information such as graphics. For efficiency, BibSearch has selectable agents so that only certain domains are searched, and it can take advantage of caching by nominating a proxy server.

Reference-contexts: The completion signal allows a user to perform other tasks until signalled that the search is complete. This eliminates the time-consuming tasks of loading and searching web pages. Other specialised searching and filtering systems exist, such as softbots [3], Letizia [4], CiFi [5], WebWatcher <ref> [1] </ref> and STEALTH [6].

Reference-contexts: This section will list all beliefs and plans of every agent in the system. BibSearch is implemented using a multi-agent system called dMARS <ref> [2] </ref>, developed by the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute. dMARS is a distributed multi-agent reasoning system and provides an environment to develop multi-agent systems. It uses a Belief, Desire, Intention (BDI) architecture [7] to support belief databases, plan formulation, event triggers, concurrent execution and agent communication.
