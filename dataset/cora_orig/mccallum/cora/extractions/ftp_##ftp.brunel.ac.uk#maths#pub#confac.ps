Abstract: H (x) f(x)(g(x) d H (x) f(x), resp.) for every x 2 V (D). If f(x) = g(x) = 1 for every x, then a connected (g; f)-factor is a hamiltonian cycle. The previous research related to the topic has been carried out either for (g; f)-factors (in general, disconnected) or for hamiltonian cycles separately, even though numerous similarities between them have been recently detected. Here we consider connected (g; f)-factors in digraphs and show that several results on hamiltonian digraphs, which are generalizations of tournaments, can be extended to connected (g; f )-factors. Applications of these results to supereulerian digraphs are also obtained.

Reference-contexts: Semicomplete digraphs and tournaments are not extension-closed. Although study of locally semicomplete digraphs, locally in-semicomplete digraphs and quasi-transitive digraphs was initiated quite recently, numerous results on the topic have been already obtained (see e.g. <ref> [1, 5, 7, 8, 16, 18, 21] </ref>). Semicomplete multipartite digraphs have been investigated for longer time, many results on their path and cycle structure can be found in [19, 25, 27]. 2 2 Results In this section, n stands for the number of vertices in a digraph under consideration.

Reference-contexts: Clearly, H has a cycle covering W if and only if D contains a connected (g; f )-factor. The above transformation is polynomial as f (x) &lt; n. 2 It was recently proved in <ref> [3] </ref> that CCV is polynomial time solvable for quasi-transitive digraphs. This result and Proposition 2.4 imply: Corollary 2.5 The connected (g; f )-factor problem is polynomial time solvable for quasi-transitive digraphs. One can check whether a quasi-transitive digraph is supereulerian in polynomial time. <p> This result and Proposition 2.4 imply: Corollary 2.5 The connected (g; f )-factor problem is polynomial time solvable for quasi-transitive digraphs. One can check whether a quasi-transitive digraph is supereulerian in polynomial time. Notice that the complexity of CCV for quasi-transitive digraphs obtained in <ref> [3] </ref> is O (n 5 ). Thus, by Proposition 2.4, the complexity of the connected (g; f )-factor problem for quasi-transitive digraphs is O (n 10 ).

We show that one can verify whether a semicomplete multipartite digraph, locally in-semicomplete digraph or quasi-transitive digraph is supereulerian in polynomial time. A semicomplete digraph is a digraph without non-adjacent vertices. Tournaments form a proper subclass of semicomplete digraphs.
