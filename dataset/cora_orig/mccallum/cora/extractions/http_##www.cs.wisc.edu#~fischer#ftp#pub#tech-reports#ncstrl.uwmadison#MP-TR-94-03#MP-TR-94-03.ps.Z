Title: A Pathsearch Damped Newton Method for Computing General Equilibria  
Author: Steven P. Dirkse Michael C. Ferris 
Date: April, 1994  
Abstract: Computable general equilibrium models and other types of variational inequalities play a key role in computational economics. This paper describes the design and implementation of a pathsearch-damped Newton method for solving such problems. Our algorithm improves on the typical Newton method (which generates and solves a sequence of LCP's) in both speed and robustness. The underlying complementarity problem is reformulated as a normal map so that standard algorithmic enchancements of Newton's method for solving nonlinear equations can be easily applied. The solver is implemented as a GAMS subsystem, using an interface library developed for this purpose. Computational results obtained from a number of test problems arising in economics are given.

Reference-contexts: At each breakpoint, the descent condition (17) is checked. The search is terminated when (17) is satisfied. If no breakpoint satisfies these conditions, the initial segment of the path is searched using an Armijo technique <ref> (Armijo 1966) </ref>. While backtracing the path is as expensive as the original construction, this is only necessary when a pathsearch is performed, and the number of searches is kept to a minimum by the watchdog stabilization technique.

Reference-contexts: The PATH solver implements a scheme of this type, modified to incorporate a pathsearch rather than a linesearch. 10 The NMS scheme implemented makes use two ideas. The first is an adaptation of the watchdog technique <ref> (Chamberlain, Powell & Lemarechal 1982) </ref> to reduce the number of pathsearches and therefore the number of function evaluations performed. The second is to allow a non-monotonic decrease in the merit function associated with the points chosen as a result of the pathsearches that are carried out.

Reference-contexts: Our implementation makes use of sparse matrix algebra to increase the dimension of the problems we can effectively solve. It also employs CPLIB to gain access to a large number of equilibrium and complementarity models which have been formulated in GAMS/MCP format <ref> (Dirkse & Ferris 1994a, Rutherford 1994a) </ref>. We believe that the GAMS/MCP system, coupled with the PATH solver or with MILES (Anstreicher, Lee & Rutherford 1992, Rutherford 1994b), provide economists with more modeling and solving capability than has previously been available. <p> This is more efficient than introducing extra variables and equations to deal with general bounds and equality constraints. In order to perform computational tests of our algorithm for solving MCP, we have formed MCPLIB, a library of complementarity models expressed in GAMS/MCP format <ref> (Dirkse & Ferris 1994a) </ref>. These models come from a wide variety of disciplines, as indicated in Table 1. <p> Each of these single pivot steps result in a linear path from the current iterate to the Newton point. Although the above problems are too small to demonstrate the efficiency of PATH for solving very large general equilibrium problems, it is noted elsewhere <ref> (Dirkse & Ferris 1994a) </ref> that PATH is an effective solver for large scale MCP's.

Reference-contexts: We believe that the GAMS/MCP system, coupled with the PATH solver or with MILES (Anstreicher, Lee & Rutherford 1992, Rutherford 1994b), provide economists with more modeling and solving capability than has previously been available. While it is possible to derive convergence results for the PATH solver <ref> (Dirkse & Ferris 1994b) </ref>, we will focus instead on the algorithm employed and the design and implementation issues involved. In order to be solved by the PATH solver, a problem must be expressed as a Mixed Complementarity Problem, or MCP.

Reference-contexts: VI's are common in mathematical programming, game theory, and transportation and regional science as well. Recently, a complementarity format has been incorporated into the GAMS language and been made available by GAMS Development Corporation. This format (called GAMS/MCP) makes use of the CPLIB library <ref> (Dirkse, Ferris, Preckel & Rutherford 1993) </ref> to formulate complementarity problems and pass them on to a complementarity solver. The computed solution is then returned to CPLIB and reported by GAMS. Rutherford (1994b) demonstrates the use of the GAMS/MCP system for equilibrium analysis and game theory models.

Reference-contexts: The cell boundaries are found via a pivot step identical to that used in the simplex method for linear programming. We have chosen to employ a Devex-type choice of leaving variable in which the bounds are relaxed by a fixed slack tolerance <ref> (Harris 1973) </ref>. This leads to fewer iterations and more stable bases. We have assumed throughout that the basis corresponding to the current values of (z; w; v) is in fact invertible, although this is not always the case in practice.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the sequence of directions can be computed using any basis updating scheme. The PATH solver was tested using three different basis packages, the Harwell LA05 code (Reid 1982), the basis routines from MINOS 5.4 <ref> (Murtagh & Saunders 1983) </ref>, and a simple basis package coded in C. We found that the MINOS routines were fastest, and have used those exclusively in subsequent testing, although the others can be substituted by setting appropriate compilation flags.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the success of Newton's method, and Josephy's variant for VI, is very dependent on the starting point chosen. This lack of robustness in Newton's method for nonlinear equations has been reduced substantially through the use of linesearch techniques which globalize the domain of convergence <ref> (Ortega & Rheinboldt 1970) </ref>. The PATH solver is an extension of Josephy's variant of Newton's method for complementarity problems which includes a pathsearch component.

Reference-contexts: A number of methods, surveyed by Harker & Pang (1990), have been proposed and used for computing solutions to variational and complementarity problems. Among the most powerful of these is the adaptation of Newton's method for variational inequalities due originally to Josephy (1979) (see also <ref> (Robinson 1993) </ref>). As in the smooth case, local quadratic convergence in a region containing a solution point can be shown under suitable conditions. Unfortunately, the method may fail to converge outside of this region, which may be quite small.
