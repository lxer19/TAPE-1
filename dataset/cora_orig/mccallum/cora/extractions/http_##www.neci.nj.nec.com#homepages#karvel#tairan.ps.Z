Abstract: We describe a linear-time algorithm for computing the likelihood that a completion joining two contour fragments passes through any given position and orientation in the image plane. Our algorithm is a resolution pyramid based method for solving a partial differential equation characterizing a distribution of short, smooth completion shapes. The PDE consists of a set of independent advection equations in (x; y) coupled in the dimension by the diffusion equation. A previously described algorithm used a first-order, explicit finite difference scheme implemented on a rectangular grid. This algorithm required O(n 3 m) time for a grid of size n fi n with m discrete orientations. Unfortunately, systematic error in solving the advection equations produced unwanted anisotropic smoothing in the (x; y) dimension. This resulted in visible artifacts in the completion fields. The amount of error and its dependence on has been previously characterized. We observe that by careful addition of extra spatial smoothing, the error can be made totally isotropic. The combined effect of this error and of intrinsic smoothness due to diffusion in the dimension is that the solution becomes smoother with increasing time, i.e., the high spatial frequencies drop out. By increasing x and t on a regular schedule, and using a second-order, implicit scheme for the diffusion term, it is possible to solve the modified PDE in O(n 2 m) time, i.e., time linear in the problem size. Using current hardware and for problems of typical size, this means that a solution which previously took one hour to compute can now be computed in about two minutes. Finally, we note that the effect of the extra spatial smoothing is less pronounced than the artifacts due to the uncorrected anisotropic error.

Reference-contexts: It has since become conventional wisdom that the shape of this contour is described by the curve of least energy, i.e., the curve which minimizes a functional of the form, E = R (ff 2 (s) + fi) ds (see Horn <ref> [4] </ref>). The curve of least energy can 1 be regarded as a maximum likelihood estimate of the shape of the completion. However, humans do not experience a sharply defined, well localized illusory contour when presented with a stimulus such as the Ehrenstein figure or Kanizsa Triangle (see Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: In a recent paper, Williams and Jacobs [10] argue that our perception more closely resembles the distribution of possible shapes and not simply the most likely shape. According to this view, the degree of sharpness is related to the variance of this distribution.

Their solution also introduced unwanted, anisotropic smoothing which resulted in noticeable artifacts in the completion fields.

Reference-contexts: The four steps correspond to the four terms of the PDE. The first two steps employ upwind differencing to ensure stability (see <ref> [6] </ref>). The third step is stable when &lt; 0:5 and the fourth step is unconditionally stable. By repeating the above four steps, p (x; y; ; t) can be computed for increasing values of t. <p> Consequently the third and fourth steps wil always be stable. In order to implement the diffusion in the dimension, we have switched from a first-order explicit scheme to a second-order implicit scheme, i.e., the Crank-Nicholson method (see <ref> [6] </ref>). With the first-order, explicit scheme, was limited to values of less than one-half. However, the Crank-Nicholson method remains stable for the larger values which reaches as t is increased. After c time-steps are performed at a given resolution, x and t are increased by a factor of two.

Reference-contexts: We have found the above projection operation to produce the most satisfactory results (see <ref> [7] </ref>). Choosing the upper-left elements or the average values within 2 fi 2 (non-overlapping) windows produced unsatisfactory results. Using the above strategy, we can efficiently simulate the evolution of the PDE for a sufficient length of time.

Reference-contexts: He shows that the maximum likelihood paths followed by such particles are curves of least energy and gives a partial differential equation (PDE) which describes the evolution in time of the probability density function describing a particle's position and direction, i.e., a Fokker-Planck equation.

Their solution also introduced unwanted, anisotropic smoothing which resulted in noticeable artifacts in the completion fields. In our approach, we carefully add smoothing so as to make the error isotropic.
