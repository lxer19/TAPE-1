Reference-contexts: Instead, we have a collection of "fuzzy" rules that an expert uses to control or describe the operation of a plant. Fuzzy control methodology enables the transformation of these "fuzzy" rules into a precise control strategy <ref> [1] </ref>. For many interesting plants (including a simplified version of docking the Space Shuttle [3]) it has been possible to transform a "fuzzy" model into a control strategy. However, no efficient algorithm is known for the general case.

Reference-contexts: Fuzzy control methodology enables the transformation of these "fuzzy" rules into a precise control strategy [1]. For many interesting plants (including a simplified version of docking the Space Shuttle <ref> [3] </ref>) it has been possible to transform a "fuzzy" model into a control strategy. However, no efficient algorithm is known for the general case. <p> However, no efficient algorithm is known for the general case. In this paper, we show that the problem of transforming a rule-based model of a plant into an appropriate control strategy is in the general case NP-hard <ref> [3] </ref>. This means that although in some cases, we do not need an expert controller, in some other cases we cannot control without his/her expertise. We point out that the idea for this work originated from the NP-hardness results of Sudarsky [4]. <p> Question: Is there a control strategy that satisfies the given objective? Theorem. The problem of transforming a rule-based model into an appropriate control strategy is NP-hard. Proof Sketch Polynomially transform the satisfiability problem for 3-CNF boolean formulas (3-SAT for short, <ref> [3] </ref>) to our problem. The 3SAT problem consists of finding a truth assignment that satisfies an input boolean formula F . The main idea is to consider the satisfaction of F as an evolutionary process with T = 3 global time steps.

PROBLEM FORMULATION To formulate our problem we must be able to describe the dynamics of a plant, its possible controls and the ob jective to be achieved. Notice that since we are proving a negative result, it is sufficient to exhibit a proof for a restrictive class of plants.
