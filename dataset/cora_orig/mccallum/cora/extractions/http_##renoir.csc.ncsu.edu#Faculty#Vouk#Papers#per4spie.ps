Abstract: Over the last 2 to 3 years, ATM has emerged as the strategic technology for the WAN and the LAN environments. This paper will explore ATM's capabilities in the LAN and in particular as a desktop connectivity technology. Because of its bandwidth scalability, ATM can accommodate the various bandwidth needs of desktop client and server platforms from 25 to 155 to 622 Mbps. New and emerging desktop applications like videoconfer-encing, network based education and multimedia applications require the isochronous capabilities of ATM. The paper will focus on application requirements on the desktop and how ATM meets those requirements, along with migration strategies from legacy LANs to ATM. Costs and timing for desktop migration to ATM are discussed.
