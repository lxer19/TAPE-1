Abstract: Summary We detail and illustrate time series analysis and spectral inference in autoregressive models with a focus on the underlying latent structure and time series decompositions. A novel class of priors on parameters of latent components leads to a new class of smoothness priors on autoregressive coefficients, provides for formal inference on model order, including very high order models, and leads to the incorporation of uncertainty about model order into summary inferences. The class of prior models also allows for subsets of unit roots, and hence leads to inference on sustained though stochastically time-varying periodicities in time series. Applications to analysis of the frequency composition of time series, in both time and spectral domains, is illustrated in a study of a time series from astronomy. This analyses demonstrates the impact and utility of the new class of priors in addressing model order uncertainty and in allowing for unit root structure. Time domain decomposition of a time series into estimated latent components provides an important alternative view of the component spectral characteristics of a series. In addition, our data analysis illustrates the utility of the smoothness prior and allowance for unit root structure in inference about spectral densities. In particular, the framework overcomes supposed problems in spectral estimation with autoregressive models using more traditional model fitting methods.

Reference-contexts: To our knowledge there is no scientific theory to explain this apparent signal in the data, though it does evidently reflect long term variability underlying the light series and has been noted in previous studies of this data <ref> (Baldwin and Thomson 1978) </ref>. The dominant, sustained periodic fluctuations in the data are evidently almost fully described by a single component, j = 2; of frequency very close to 0.420, or a period of about 149.8 days.

Reference-contexts: Traditional methods of autoregressive model fitting have led to concerns about the resulting estimates of spectra <ref> (Thomson 1990) </ref>. Some of these questions related to parametric versus nonparametric spectral estimation are a side issue here; a parametric model that is demonstrably adequate in terms of its fit to the observed data is acceptable as a foundation for parametric spectral density estimation.

Reference-contexts: Stationarity corresponds to jr j j &lt; 1 for all j = 1; : : : ; p; whereas the autoregressive model and above decompositions are valid for any values of the r j ; as is clear in the derivation of the decomposition from a state-space viewpoint <ref> (West 1997) </ref>. In the case of a stationary model, the decomposition is exactly that derived from the standard partial fractions inversion of stationary autoregressions, but the state-space approach demonstrates a much broader validity (including, for example, time-varying parameter autoregressions).
