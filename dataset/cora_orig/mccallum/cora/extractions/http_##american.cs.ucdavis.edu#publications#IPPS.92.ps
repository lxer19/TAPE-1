Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid shared memory architecture which combines the scalability of a multistage interconnection network with the contention reduction benefits of coherent caches. We achieve this by replacing the memory modules and final stages of a multistage interconnection network with clusters of coherent caches. The performance of Cache Coherent Hybrid Interconnected Memory Extension (CCHIME) is evaluated by analyzing the results of extensive simulations of the network and coherent cache clusters. These results indicate that the CCHIME architecture can achieve lower memory access latencies and higher throughputs than typical multistage interconnection networks.

Reference-contexts: Bus-based coherence schemes are not scalable past a certain point due to bandwidth limitations of the coherence bus. However, they can be effective for limited cluster sizes <ref> [ArBa86] </ref>. Therefore, CCHIME only provides cache coherence across small clusters of caches attached to a single memory module. This approach can reduce both the amount of memory contention and the latency of memory requests in a number of ways.

Reference-contexts: The maximum bandwidth of a MIN can only approach unity, even if there are no hot spots, because collisions in both the nodes and the memory modules occur even under uniform traffic <ref> [DiJu81] </ref>. 3.5. Performance of CCHIME Our simulations measured the performance of the CCHIME architecture in terms of issue rate and round trip memory latency.

Reference-contexts: These coherent caches clusters allow the CCHIME architecture to actually achieve performance that is superior to an unmodified MIN. (the incorporation of caches at the memory modules is orthogonal to other methods of controlling memory contention and tree saturation, such as combining <ref> [GGKM83, LeK86, PfNo85] </ref>). 2. The CCHIME Architecture CCHIME is a hybrid of the bus-based cache-coherent and multistage interconnection network architectures. In the CCHIME architecture the function of the multi-stage interconnection network is not to connect processors and memory modules, but to connect processors and caches (see Figure 1).

Reference-contexts: A hybrid network combining a MIN and a collection of shared busses has been proposed by Harper and Jump <ref> [HaJu90] </ref>. In this architecture the final stages of a multistage interconnection network are replaced by busses which connect directly to memory modules. This architecture can be thought of as a compromise between bus-based and MIN based architectures.

It has been noted that hot spots are transient <ref> [LeK86] </ref>, but the amount of time spent in different states (both in terms of the degree of nonuniformity and the percentage of hot processors) has not been fully explored in the literature, and is not examined here. We assume a steady-state representation.

Reference-contexts: Systems with such caches must also deal with complex cache coherency issues, some of which are addressed in Stenstrom [Sten89]. The incorporation of caches in the switching nodes of the network has also been discussed <ref> [MaTi90, MBLZ89] </ref>. However, simulations have indicated that the substantial complexity and expense of maintaining caches and cache coherence at all nodes internal to the network is not warranted by the limited increase in throughput.

Reference-contexts: The queues at these switches can also fill, and the effects will propagate backwards through the network forming a tree of nodes whose queues are full.

The Simulations The simulator was run under a variety of conditions, varying parameters such as number of caches in each cluster, hot rate, cache access time, cache hit rate, etc. Each processor will attempt to offer a request during each processor cycle time, P.
