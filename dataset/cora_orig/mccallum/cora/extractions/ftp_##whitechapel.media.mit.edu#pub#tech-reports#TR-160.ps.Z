Abstract: The aura matrix of an image indicates how much of each graylevel is present in the neighborhood of each other graylevel and generalizes the popular texture analysis tool, the co-occurrence matrix. In this paper, we show that interesting structure appears in both the aura and co-occurrence matrices for textures which are synthesized from Gibbs random field models. We derive this structure by characterizing configurations of the distribution which are most likely to be synthesized when the Gibbs energy is minimized. This minimization is an important part of applications which use the Gibbs model within a Bayesian estimation framework for maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. In particular, we show that the aura matrix will become tridiagonal for an attractive auto-binomial field when suitable constraints exist on the histogram, neighborhood, and image sizes. Under the same constraints, but where the field is repulsive instead of attractive, the matrix will become anti-tridiagonal. The interpretation of this structure is especially significant for modeling textures with minimum energy configurations: zeros in the matrix prohibit certain colors from occurring next to each other, thus prohibiting large classes of textures from being formed. fl This work was supported by the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Grant No. MIP-88-14612, the National Science Foundation under Grant No. IRI-8719920, the Rome Air Development Center (RADC) of the Air Force System Command and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under contract No. F30602-89-C-0022.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Since the equivalence between Markov and Gibbs random fields (GRF)'s was established by the Hammersley-Clifford theorem <ref> [1] </ref> there has been a great interest in using random field models for images and image texture patterns. A nice variety of textures have been shown to exist as samples of a Gibbs random field [2]. <p> The set of all sites with graylevel g is S g = fs 2 Sjx s = gg, 8g 2 fl. The vector of graylevel values is g = <ref> [0; 1; : : :; n 1] </ref> T . The basic methodology for GRF texture synthesis is the following. <p> Pentland and John Wyatt, Jr..

Reference-contexts: In these cases and others where textures are being synthesized as samples of Gibbs models with low energy, it is helpful to know the kinds of patterns that are likely to be formed. In a recent paper <ref> [4] </ref> we have shown that the Gibbs energy can be computed for a large class of GRF models by using a generalized form of graylevel co-occurrences that we call "aura measures." When organized in a matrix indexed by the graylevels, the aura measures form an "aura matrix" that is a generalization <p> For the case of the isotropic, homogeneous, pairwise interaction model, it has been shown that the Gibbs energy can be rewritten as a linear combination of aura measures <ref> [4] </ref>, E (x) = g;g 0 2fl A generalization of this result to an anisotropic field was given in [9]. The aura matrix irreducibility and the bounds on boundary length can also be written as linear constraints on the aura measures. <p> Since ^ff corresponds to the values off the diagonal, its minimization is achieved by setting it equal to the lower bound of m (0; 1). From miscibility analysis <ref> [4] </ref> we know that the "mixing" between colors 0 and 1, m (0; 1) = fl-m (0; 1), is bounded below by the minimum boundary length between the two graylevels. <p> These also have the property of maximizing miscibilities, hence maximizing boundary lengths <ref> [4] </ref>. 5.1 Energy in terms of the reversing permutation Now we want to characterize the 's which minimize the sum of positive numbers, X ff g T P g; (16) subject to the constraints and assumptions already stated. <p> The aura matrices for the two isotropic subneighborhoods are shown to illustrate their tridiagonal and anti-tridiagonal structure. 6.2 Formulation For the anisotropic case it has previously been shown <ref> [4] </ref> that the expression in (5) becomes K X fi k g;g 0 2fl In matrix form, the goal is to maximize K X fi k g T A k g; (26) where A k is the corresponding symmetric aura matrix of m k (g; g 0 ). <p> Consequently, the theory presented here accounts for the experimental behavior observed during texture formation in earlier publications <ref> [4, 9] </ref>. For the anisotropic, auto-binomial GRF, the aura matrix is formed by linearly combining the constituent isotropic matrices. Thus, its ground state is a combination of the tridiagonal and anti-tridiagonal structures. <p> 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 7 7 7 2 6 6 4 1 3 3 7 7 5 2 6 6 4 0 1 3 7 7 5 We say that this is equivalent to permuting the vector g = <ref> [0; 1; 2; 3; 4] </ref> T by the cycle 1 = (3; 1; 0).

Reference-contexts: These results indicate, apparently for the first time, a relationship between a texture synthesis model and its co-occurrence matrix. Identifying properties of a texture which correspond to structure in co-occurrence matrices has been an important pursuit <ref> [5] </ref>. 3. Most importantly, we show for the first time that the ground state aura matrix structure implies strong restrictions about which classes of patterns can and cannot be generated as minimum energy configurations of the auto-binomial GRF. The paper is organized as follows.

Reference-contexts: Although the measure is general, in this paper the subsets are the S g 's, i.e., sets of sites having the same graylevel. The aura measure has been formally defined as follows <ref> [8] </ref>: 4 i = 0 i = 100 (a) (b) (c) fi 1 = fi 2 = fi 3 = fi 4 = 0:2, and fi 5 = fi 6 = fi 7 = fi 8 = 0:1, (b) fi = 0:5, and (c) fi 1 = fi 2 = fi <p> When the neighborhood structure is symmetric, the aura matrix, and therefore the miscibility matrix is symmetric. Moreover, because of the uniform histogram constraint, the miscibility matrix is doubly 5 stochastic 1 . These statements, along with many other properties of the aura matrix and aura measures are proved in <ref> [8] </ref>. In addition to these properties, the constraints of the lattice geometry yield the following: 1. Aura matrix irreducibility: Because the lattice is connected, one can reach any graylevel set from any other graylevel set.

Reference-contexts: Then we can define the aura measures of these subsets with respect to each other. The following definition is adopted from <ref> [9] </ref>: Definition 2 Let S i S; i = 0; 1; : : : ; n 1, S n1 i=0 S i = S and S i " S j = ; unless i = j. <p> For the case of the isotropic, homogeneous, pairwise interaction model, it has been shown that the Gibbs energy can be rewritten as a linear combination of aura measures [4], E (x) = g;g 0 2fl A generalization of this result to an anisotropic field was given in <ref> [9] </ref>. The aura matrix irreducibility and the bounds on boundary length can also be written as linear constraints on the aura measures. These constraints along with the linear form of the Gibbs energy as a cost function constitute a linear program with the aura measures as variables. <p> For jfi k j varying, the terms with largest jfi k j will become tridiagonal or anti-tridiagonal fastest following the interpretation of bonding parameters as temperature annealing rates <ref> [9] </ref>. The interaction of different rates in different directions leads to textural behavior that is much more difficult to predict, and often quite a bit more interesting visually. 7 Applications and implications 7.1 Restrictions on texture patterns These new results on aura structure are significant for texture characterization. <p> Consequently, the theory presented here accounts for the experimental behavior observed during texture formation in earlier publications <ref> [4, 9] </ref>. For the anisotropic, auto-binomial GRF, the aura matrix is formed by linearly combining the constituent isotropic matrices. Thus, its ground state is a combination of the tridiagonal and anti-tridiagonal structures.

Reference-contexts: Even as the matrices are becoming tridiagonal or anti-tridiagonal (i.e., not yet in their ground states) their intermediate banded structures imply which large classes of configurations are exceedingly unlikely to occur. This bandedness has also been related to the temperature of the model <ref> [12] </ref> so that the temperature can be used to guide these stages of pattern formation. We have seen that the ground state structure results in a global pattern unlike the small scale random patterns usually associated with GRF texture models.
