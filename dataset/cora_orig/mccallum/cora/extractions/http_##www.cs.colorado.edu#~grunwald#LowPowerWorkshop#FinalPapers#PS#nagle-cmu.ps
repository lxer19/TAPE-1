Title: Abstract  
Abstract: For many low-power systems, the power cost of floating-point hardware has been prohibitively expensive. This paper explores ways of reducing floating-point power consumption by minimizing the bit-width representation of floating-point data. Analysis of several floating point programs that utilize low-resolution sensory data shows that the programs suffer almost no loss of accuracy even with a significant reduction in bit-width. This floating point bit-width reduction can deliver a significant power saving through the use of a variable bit-width floating point unit.

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, it is possible to obtain a mean estimation of the power consumption using statistical techniques <ref> [Burch92] </ref>. In our approach, we ran 50 batches of vectors with each batch containing 30 vectors to insure a 95% confidence intervals. The energy dissipation is computed using the cycle time in Table 3.
