Reference-contexts: And a server at the Weizmann Institute of Science provides access to the BIOCCELERATOR [ 7 ] hardware. Other tools, but without web interfaces, include MPSRCH at the Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Norway <ref> [ 1 ] </ref> , which provides an e-mail server to the massively parallel MasPar computer for querying sequence databases using the Smith-Waterman local similarity algorithm, and MultiSearch at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center [ 17 ] , which runs on the Cray T3D and searches sequence databases using a variety of methods,

Reference-contexts: For the authors of the software, a web interface to their system allows for easy upgrades and bug fixes, as well as the opportunity to monitor usage of the system. MEME is a software tool for discovering motifs in groups of DNA or protein sequences <ref> [ 3; 2 ] </ref> . The acronym stands for "Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation," because the program uses the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to locate one or more repeated patterns, called "motifs," in a sequence or series of sequences.

MEME searches by building statistical models of motifs. Each model consists of a matrix of discrete probability distributions. A value at position (i; j) in the matrix is the probability that letter i will appear in position j of the motif.

Reference-contexts: Motifs are ideally suited for, among other things, database searches [ 22 ] , identifying structurally and functionally important portions of proteins <ref> [ 4 ] </ref> , characterizing DNA protein-binding sites [ 20 ] and designing degenerate PCR primers [ 9 ] .

Reference-contexts: It also provides access for inexperienced or occasional users and for users who lack the appropriate hardware or software to install the system at their own sites. For example, a server at at the Weizmann Institute of Science <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> provides web access to the BIOCCELERATOR series of database search engines which run on special-purpose hardware. Also, an easily accessible web interface allows users who are considering installing the software locally to test the software before installing it. <p> Similarly, the BioSCAN server [ 8 ] accesses specialized VLSI hardware at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. And a server at the Weizmann Institute of Science provides access to the BIOCCELERATOR <ref> [ 7 ] </ref> hardware.

Reference-contexts: We know of several other computational biology tools running on parallel computers with worldwide web interfaces. The GenQuest Q server at Johns Hopkins University [ 15 ] provides access to a specialized parallel computing environment at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

MEME discovers motifs automatically given only a group sequences as input. In general, discovering motifs is difficult because the patterns need not be exact; there may be only approximate similarity between instances of one motif. As the number of sequences increases, exhaustive search quickly becomes intractable.

Reference-contexts: MEME was ported to the Paragon using MP++, a message-passing library developed at UCSD [ 16 ] . The version of MP++ running on the SDSC Paragon is based upon NX, the Paragon's native messaging system; however, a version of MP++ based upon MPI is also available <ref> [ 10 ] </ref> . MP++ is portable to a number of platforms, including the CM5, Cray C90 and T3D, PVM, and Sun4, Alpha and RS6000 workstations. On serial workstations, MP++ simulates multiple processors using separate processes.

Reference-contexts: To submit data to ParaMEME, a user begins by entering in a web browser an e-mail address, a brief description of the data, and the sequences themselves. The sequences can be in any format supported by the readseq program <ref> [ 11 ] </ref> , including GenBank, NBRF, FASTA, and many others. The user selects from various ParaMEME options: DNA or protein sequences, the type of model desired (OOPS, ZOOPS or TCM), and the estimated motif width.

Reference-contexts: MEME takes as input one or more sequences believed to contain one or more motifs, and outputs a series of motif models. Each of these models is a position-dependent letter frequency matrix (similar to a gapless profile <ref> [ 12 ] </ref> ) and describes a single motif.

Reference-contexts: Each of these models is a position-dependent letter frequency matrix (similar to a gapless profile [ 12 ] ) and describes a single motif. Our definition of motifs is related to that of blocks <ref> [ 13 ] </ref> multiply aligned sequence segments that correspond to the most highly conserved regions of protein families but is more general because we allow motifs to represent patterns that repeat in a single sequence, and because we consider DNA as well as protein motifs.

Reference-contexts: In general, discovering motifs is difficult because the patterns need not be exact; there may be only approximate similarity between instances of one motif. As the number of sequences increases, exhaustive search quickly becomes intractable. MEME differs from similar tools such as the Gibbs sampler <ref> [ 18 ] </ref> in that MEME does not require the user to provide prior knowledge about the distribution of instances of motifs in the given data set.

Reference-contexts: A major hurdle to creating a web interface to a single, centralized software system is coping with potentially large numbers of simultaneous users. In order to provide efficient access, MEME was ported to the San Diego Supercomputer Center's 400-node Intel Paragon XP/S <ref> [ 21 ] </ref> . The web interface was linked via a Unix socket directly to the Paragon, allowing a user's click on the Submit button to enqueue a job on the supercomputer.

Reference-contexts: The worldwide web offers an alternative mode of software distribution. Rather than disseminating the software itself, the web can provide a gateway to a single system running the software at a central location, accessible by more than 7.5 million people in the United States alone <ref> [ 23 ] </ref> . For the user, such a paradigm removes the difficulties involved in downloading and installing the system. It also provides access for inexperienced or occasional users and for users who lack the appropriate hardware or software to install the system at their own sites.
