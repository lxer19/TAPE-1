Abstract: We consider a general family of auction protocols that admit multiple buyers and sellers, and determine market-clearing prices. We analyze the economic incentives facing participants in such auctions, demonstrating that it is possible to induce truthful revelation of values by buyers or sellers, but not both, and for single- but not multi-unit bids. We also perform a computational analysis of the auctioneer's task, exhibiting efficient algorithms for processing bids and calculat ing allocations.

Reference-contexts: Notice that this definition generalizes the common notion of bid-ask spread, since it applies even if the buy and sell bids overlap. In fact, the M th- and (M + 1)st-price rules belong to a more general class of mechanisms called k-double auctions [18]. The parameter k 2 <ref> [0; 1] </ref> specifies the fraction between the (M + 1)st and M th prices at which the clearing price is set. The algorithm we present in Section 5 applies to the entire class of k-double auctions. <p> Rothkopf et al. [17] study restrictions in allowable multicommodity bundles that enable tractable solution of the auction's optimization problem. Even when each auction faces a tractable problem, we might obtain significant computational savings by careful management of the communication and clearing operations. Andersson and Ygge <ref> [1] </ref> apply hierarchical market structures for distributing the calculation of market-clearing prices and allocations. Their CoTree algorithm allows designers to make tradeoffs between the number of messages, and the dimension of local excess demand calculations.

Reference-contexts: The size of this heap is O (M ). Recall that a heap data structure is a complete binary tree, with the property that each node has a priority not exceeding its parent's <ref> [3] </ref>. Inserting a new node into the heap (put), or removing the top node (get) each take O (lg K) time, where K is the size of the heap. The 4-Heap algorithm ensures several constraints among the heaps.

Reference-contexts: Potential buyers and sellers must first find one another, then negotiate the terms of the exchange, and finally, execute the transaction. Electronic commerce promises to automate part, or all, of each of these steps.

Reference-contexts: Let us assume, contrary to what we aim to prove, that there is an auction with the specified properties. By the revelation principle <ref> [7] </ref>, any auction is equivalent to some direct revelation mechanism, where each consumer reports a utility function. Let the buyers report their utility in terms of their marginal valuation for the good.

Reference-contexts: Two-sided, or double auctions [5], in contrast, permit multiple buyers and sellers to bid to exchange a designated commodity. The continuous double auction (CDA), matches buyers and sellers immediately on detection of compatible bids. A periodic version of the double auction (sometimes termed a call market <ref> [12] </ref> or clearinghouse) instead collects bids over a specified interval of time, then clears the market at the expiration of the bidding interval. 2 Most types of auctions can be characterized in terms of how they manage three core activities: 1. Process Bid. <p> The second-price rule was proposed and analyzed by Vickrey in his seminal work establishing the field of auction theory [19]. 3 When M &gt; 1, the M th-and (M + 1)st-price auctions correspond to the multi-unit generalizations of Dutch and English auctions studied by McCabe et al. <ref> [12] </ref>. 4 Incentive Compatibility Analysis The M th- and (M + 1)st-price rules are symmetric with respect to their treatment of buyers and sellers.

Reference-contexts: If the agents have uncertain correlated values, then, in any of the auctions considered here, an agent should generally bid below its estimated valuation in order to avoid the "winner's curse" <ref> [14] </ref>. An auction is individually rational if its allocations do not make any agent worse off than had they not participated. As noted above, for M = 1 the (M + 1)st-price auction is the well-studied second-price mechanism.

Reference-contexts: The only way to get incentive compatibility for both is if some party is willing to subsidize the auction. Myerson and Satterthwaite <ref> [16] </ref> show that there does not exist any bargaining mechanism that is individually rational, efficient, and Bayesian incentive compatible for both buyers and sellers, that does not require outside subsidies. We next consider another relaxation of the theorems' conditions, specifically the restriction to single-unit bids.

Reference-contexts: This is especially relevant to auctions covering multiple commodities, in which clearing prices are often determined by combinatorial optimization. Rothkopf et al. <ref> [17] </ref> study restrictions in allowable multicommodity bundles that enable tractable solution of the auction's optimization problem. Even when each auction faces a tractable problem, we might obtain significant computational savings by careful management of the communication and clearing operations.

Reference-contexts: The second-price rule was proposed and analyzed by Vickrey in his seminal work establishing the field of auction theory <ref> [19] </ref>. 3 When M &gt; 1, the M th-and (M + 1)st-price auctions correspond to the multi-unit generalizations of Dutch and English auctions studied by McCabe et al.

As noted above, for M = 1 the (M + 1)st-price auction is the well-studied second-price mechanism. Vickrey <ref> [19] </ref> showed that the sealed-bid version of this mechanism is incentive compatible for the buyers. The intuition behind this result is as follows. Recall that the agent with the highest buy offer wins the good but pays the price of the second highest offer. <p> We next consider another relaxation of the theorems' conditions, specifically the restriction to single-unit bids. The Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA) [9]|an extension of mechanisms developed by Vickrey <ref> [19] </ref>, Clarke [2], and Groves [8]|is incentive compatible for all bidders. 4 The GVA is a direct revelation mechanism [6]; agents submit their reservation prices (equivalent to their utility functions under the independent private values model) as bids. <p> When we admit multi-unit bids in the (M + 1)st-price auction, the price that the buyer pays for one unit may be set by its bid for the other unit, creating a built-in collusion <ref> [19] </ref>. As a result, it is suboptimal for the buyer to place truthful multi-unit bids. We now show that this result generalizes to a broad class of uniform-price auctions.
