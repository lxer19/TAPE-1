Abstract: Four computer applications are presented that encourage students to develop mathematical coordination - the ability to manipulate numerical variables in cooperation with other students so as to achieve a definite goal. The programs enable a form of computersupported cooperative learning (CSCL). In this paper we describe the rationale and design of the programs, the results of an informal evaluation, and possible future work. The games were developed using a special software and hardware environment that facilitates the rapid prototyping of computer-based cooperative-learning materials. This research is part of an ongoing project entitled Mathematics Experiences Through Image Processing whose objective is to develop and test educational materials that introduce K-12 students to mathematical ideas within the context of digital image processing activities.

Reference-contexts: Even in systems with a large shared view screen must constantly their attention from their own monitor to the front of the room to gain context. CSCL '95 Proceedings 3 September 1995 MMM <ref> [1] </ref> is a multi user system in which each person has control of his or her own mouse, but all are working on one screen. This is the same situation found in most interactive home video games developed by Nintendo, Sega and Atari.

Reference-contexts: Previous Work A number of educational researchers have sought to exploit computer technology in promoting learning through collaboration. For example, Clements used the Logo programming environment in a collaborative setting (i.e. multiple users on a single input machine) to study student learning through cognitive conflict and subsequent resolution <ref> [3] </ref>. The results of their study suggests that the collaborative use of Logo encourages interaction, discussions, coordination of different ideas and higher order thinking [12]. Unfortunately, the use of the computer in this way also promoted social conflict over the input devices. <p> The SID users were quiet, except to ask questions on how to operate the software. In contrast, the students using the MID software communicated a great deal, commanding each other to add more green or less blue. Unlike the cooperative Logo studies done by Clements <ref> [3] </ref>, there was very little conflict between these users as there was no contention for the input resources although some students did get slightly frustrated in discovering that they could not manipulate another player's color. Overall the students enjoyed playing with both versions of the software.

Reference-contexts: Simultaneous input tends to reduce the conflict over access to the computer, and it may increase the average rate of learning for the students in the group. The reasons to support cooperative learning has been well stated by Davidson <ref> [4] </ref> in relation to mathematics. Group learning addresses some of the problems associated with the isolative nature of typical mathematics curricula. As a whole, students working in a group become less discouraged and frustrated than students working alone.

Reference-contexts: The small group size was not only chosen to facilitate easy access to the machine, but also because groups of this size seem to work best for collaborative learning <ref> [5] </ref>. Furthermore, working in small collaborative groups teaches students skills needed in later life to interact with their peers in college or on the job.

Reference-contexts: Still, because the hardware inhibits direct visual access to partners, these systems do not foster the same level of communication as one finds in faceto-face situations. Meeting room systems <ref> [6, 17, 18, 19] </ref> are specifically designed to allow multiple users, each on their own machines, to work collaboratively and still maintain direct faceto-face communication.

Reference-contexts: In many cases the users develop their own language about the activity. 3.2. The Color Matcher The Color Matcher is the CSCL application that we developed first. This activity was designed to promote learning and discussion about the RGB additive system used by most monitors for displaying color <ref> [7] </ref>. It won an industry award for its creative use of the Access.Bus multiple input technology. The Color Matcher activity gives each of three players access to his or her own mouse which corresponds to a red, green or blue colored cursor on the screen.

Reference-contexts: The restricted communication is designed to make the communication between users more productive. This type of interaction has been seen in many other distributed CSCL applications [2,11,15,16,17]. Synchronous networked collaboration can be enhanced by adding real time video conferencing, similar to cooperative work systems such as EuroParc's RAVE <ref> [8] </ref>, or Clearboard [9]. Still, because the hardware inhibits direct visual access to partners, these systems do not foster the same level of communication as one finds in faceto-face situations.

TurtleGraph <ref> [10] </ref> is a similar problem solving environment in which Lisp is used to command the cursor. Additionally the environment has the capability to allow communication between students. The system regulates the communication through button presses and an area for conversational dialog.

Reference-contexts: The goals of these activities, as directed by the NCTM standards, are to favor conceptual learning over rote operations, emphasize practical uses of mathematics, encourage group discussions, and promote exploratory, open-ended discovery <ref> [13] </ref>. In particular, the programs described have relatively few shared screen objects (such as the check button). This forces the students to communicate with each other about manipulating the individual objects, rather than moving them themselves.

Reference-contexts: The programs we present are intended to support mathematics teaching with the 1989 standards by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. Numerous reports have documented the difficulties that K-12 students in the United States have with mathematics (e.g., see <ref> [14] </ref>). When pressed for a reason, students often complain that mathematics is difficult and that they don't see much use for it beyond simple arithmetic.
