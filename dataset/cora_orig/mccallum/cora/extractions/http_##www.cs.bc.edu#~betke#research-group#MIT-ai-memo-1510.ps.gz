Abstract: A fast simulated annealing algorithm is developed for automatic object recognition. The object recognition problem is addressed as the problem of best describing a match between a hypothesized object and an image. The normalized correlation coefficient is used as a measure of the match. Templates are generated on-line during the search by transforming model images. Simulated annealing reduces the search time by orders of magnitude with respect to an exhaustive search. The algorithm is applied to the problem of how landmarks, for example, traffic signs, can be recognized by an autonomous vehicle or a navigating robot. Images are assumed to be taken while the robot or the vehicle is moving through its environment. It tries to match them with templates created online from models stored in a database. We illustrate the performance of our algorithm with real-world images of complicated scenes with traffic signs. False positive matches occur only for templates with very small information content. To avoid false positive matches, we propose a method to select model images for robust object recognition by measuring the information content of the model images. The algorithm works well in noisy images for model images with high information content. This report describes research done at the Center for Biological and Computational Learning and the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Support for the Center is provided in part by a grant from the National Science Foundation under contract ASC-9217041.

Reference-contexts: There are several approaches published in the literature that either reduce the size of the search space or that direct the search towards areas in the search space for which a match is more likely <ref> [Gri88, Gri90, NR72, MR90, AF86] </ref>. In this paper a new approach is proposed that uses both such techniques. We discuss the problem of how certain landmarks, for example traffic signs, can be recognized by an autonomous vehicle or robot.

Reference-contexts: Matched filtering has been used much earlier in the areas of radar, sonar, and signal processing [Opp78]. Valuable information for visual object recognition can be obtained from that literature. Although template matching has been widely used in computer vision <ref> [BB82, Yar85] </ref>, a crucial problem with the method is the size of the search space [MR90, LC88].

Reference-contexts: Automatically recognizing traffic signs in images is very valuable for mobile robot or autonomous vehicle navigation. A robot that can recognize a traffic sign as a familiar landmark in its map of the environment can then use this information to localize itself in its environment <ref> [BG94, Bra90] </ref>. Our method stands apart from previous approaches to traffic sign recognition because first, it is efficiently applied to real-world landscape images (as opposed to Ettinger's isolated signs [Ett88]), and second, it does not rely on color perception which is very sensitive to lighting changes.

Reference-contexts: Using the correlation as a measure of successful recognition is also advantageous because it is a very robust measure. That is, it is relatively insensitive to fluctuations in the environment compared to higher resolution methods, as is well documented in spectral, bearing, and range estimation problems <ref> [Joh82, BKM93] </ref>. 3 Generating Templates from Model Images A template T (x; y) is generated from a model image M (x; y) by choosing three parameters that describe a transformation from M into T .

Reference-contexts: For future work, severe illumination variations within the object and occlusion problems can be addressed. Other applications of our method, for example in medical computer vision and in face recognition, are being investigated. A recent paper by Brunelli and Poggio <ref> [BP93] </ref> reports successful face recognition using template matching. The authors normalize their test images by fixing the direction of the eye-to-eye axis and the interocular distance. The location of the masks for eye, nose, mouth, and face templates are also fixed.

Reference-contexts: The optimization technique fast simulated annealing is applied to avoid the cost of brute-force search by directing the search successfully. It reduces the search time by orders of magnitude. Recent publications in the sonar literature <ref> [CBK + 93, KCPD90] </ref> show that fast simulated annealing has been very successful in coherent signal extraction and localization in noisy environments. We use it in a similar way for incoherent image process ing. <p> Therefore, at a specific temperature we do not combine the test for the choice of the location, sampling, and rotation angle. We also obtain good results using simulated annealing only for the location parameters, and a gradient descent procedure <ref> [CBK + 93] </ref> for the remaining parameters given large enough perturbations.

[GGGD90]. However, for visual object recognition, fast simulated annealing has yet not been exploited. This paper is organized in the following way: The object recognition problem is defined as a parameter search problem in Section 2.

As a criteria for stopping the annealing process, we simply put a limit on the search length L. Although this does not ensure convergence to the optimal correlation coefficient, the solutions we obtain for the parameters are generally sufficient and solve the recognition task.

As Kuperman et al. <ref> [KCPD90] </ref> point out, if the search problem involves different kinds of parameters the annealing algorithm is rather analogous to the cooling of a mixture of liquids, each of which have different freezing points. An algorithm that randomly perturbs all parameters at the same time has poor convergence properties.
