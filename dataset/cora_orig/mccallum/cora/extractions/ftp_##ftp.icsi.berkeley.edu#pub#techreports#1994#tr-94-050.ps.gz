Abstract: Current approaches to supporting real-time communication allocate network resources either to individual connections, or to aggregates of connections, based on type of traffic, protocol, or performance requirements. The first approach provides well-defined performance guarantees that are independent of other network traffic. The second approach may achieve higher utilization of network resources, but the expected performance is less well-defined since it is dependent on the behavior of unrelated (possibly unknown) connections. Resource sharing is a new approach that exploits known relationships between related connections to allow network resources to be shared without sacrificing well-defined guarantees. Most importantly, for large conferences with a bounded number of concurrent speakers, resource requirements do not increase with the number of potential speakers. Therefore, resource sharing is an important tool for providing real-time performance guarantees for large conferences. This paper presents a fully distributed technique for using resource sharing to provide real-time guarantees in a general internetworking environment. The technique is described in the context of its implementation in the next generation of the Tenet real-time protocols. However, the underlying principles are equally applicable to other communication paradigms and techniques. A companion report presents the results of simulation experiments; the simulations show that resource sharing leads to large gains in connection acceptance rates and a significant reduction in computational overhead associated with admission control for real-time communication.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Many classes of applications, including distributed multimedia group communication [13] and traditional distributed processing, require or benefit from a network communication service that provides well-defined performance guarantees. A number of protocols and schemes have been proposed to provide real-time communication services <ref> [2, 6] </ref>. These schemes are usually connection-oriented, in that they allocate network resources (e.g., bandwidth, buffers, etc.) along the path data packets will travel. <p> One technique to improve utilization (and hence the connection acceptance rate) is to measure the actual traffic characterization of individual connections and to modify the connection traffic characterization dynamically [16]. Another technique uses performance measurements over aggregations of connections to predict future performance <ref> [2] </ref>. The first approach still over-estimates aggregate resource requirements, since it fails to capture the important relationships between connections (e.g. in a conference, usually only one speaker is active at a time).

Reference-contexts: A number of protocols and schemes have been proposed to provide real-time communication services [2, 6]. These schemes are usually connection-oriented, in that they allocate network resources (e.g., bandwidth, buffers, etc.) along the path data packets will travel. Traditional real-time network systems (e.g., <ref> [4] </ref>) may over-allocate resources for two reasons: (1) they allocate resources based on a worst-case prediction of the actual traffic; and (2) they treat traffic on different connections independently when determining their resource requirements. <p> Section 7 describes the related work by other researchers, and we conclude this paper with suggestions for future work in Section 8. 2 Background In this section, we provide a very brief introduction to the Tenet protocols; interested readers can find a more detailed explanation in <ref> [4, 11] </ref>. It may be noted that while the current discussion is in the context of the Tenet protocols, the underlying ideas are equally applicable to other communication schemes and paradigms.

Reference-contexts: We have also adapted this algorithm to maintain state information for each sharing group, both to enhance path overlap and to meet the delay restrictions specified above. 6.3 Interactions with advance reservations The Tenet research group has recently devised techniques for providing advance reservations for multi-party real-time communication <ref> [5] </ref>. In this service, the clients can make a request for network resources in advance of their use. A client may, for example, request a connection on Monday for a Wednesday video-conference.

Reference-contexts: It may be noted that while the current discussion is in the context of the Tenet protocols, the underlying ideas are equally applicable to other communication schemes and paradigms. In the second generation of the Tenet protocols <ref> [7] </ref>, the basic abstraction is the multicast real-time channel|a simplex, one-to-many connection at the network-layer. A conference with M sources and N destinations consists of M multicast channels to the same set of N destinations, where the destination set is referred to as the Target Set for that conference.

Reference-contexts: The mechanisms we have devised are completely distributed; hence, they do not restrict the scalability of communication, and are robust in the presence of node and link failures. Indeed, simulation results indicate that resource sharing improves the scalability of communication <ref> [8] </ref>. Three types of mechanisms are required: * Client-service interface: The network client must inform the network of sharing relationships between channels. <p> Thus, adding a new channel for an already established group may result in additional buffer allocation at that node. 6.2 Interactions with routing The analysis and simulations described in <ref> [8] </ref> support the intuition that routing techniques affect the success of resource sharing. <p> The scheme provides a fully-distributed, low-overhead technique for implementing resource sharing. We have evaluated the performance of this scheme by analysis and by simulations. Results <ref> [8] </ref> show that resource sharing is very useful in saving network resources. It achieves both higher connection acceptance rate and lower computational cost for admission control (than without resource sharing), while still providing guaranteed performance to the clients, independent of the behavior of other, unrelated, traffic.

Reference-contexts: Two of the authors have previously defined the channel groups abstraction to enable clients to specify inter-channel relationships to the network <ref> [9] </ref>. To specify a list of channels that may share resources, we define a channel group with a resource sharing relationship. Individual channels then join the group to share resources with other member channels. * Resource requirements for each group.

Reference-contexts: To simplify changing from individual specifications to the group specification, all channels are given the same local delay bound during establishment, even when the scheduling discipline would allow us to give separate delay bounds per channel (such as with Earliest Due Date scheduling <ref> [10] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: Section 7 describes the related work by other researchers, and we conclude this paper with suggestions for future work in Section 8. 2 Background In this section, we provide a very brief introduction to the Tenet protocols; interested readers can find a more detailed explanation in <ref> [4, 11] </ref>. It may be noted that while the current discussion is in the context of the Tenet protocols, the underlying ideas are equally applicable to other communication schemes and paradigms. <p> An interesting issue is the interaction of this globally specified relationship with the admission control decisions that are made locally at the intermediate nodes (the local decision-making is due to the distributed nature of our resource sharing technique). During channel establishment, the Real-Time Channel Administration Protocol (RCAP) <ref> [11] </ref> is responsible for admission control and resource reservation at each node. When the RCAP module at a certain node is reserving resources for a new channel, it allocates buffers for handling the delay jitter of the data packets from the previous node.

Reference-contexts: Since many data streams cannot be scaled arbitrarily without serious degradation in perceived quality (e.g. [15] ), we argue that the source should specify the resource requirements (at least in terms of bandwidth). Receiver control over bandwidth requirements can be obtained by using layered coding schemes <ref> [12] </ref> and putting each layer in a separate sharing group. This approach will be studied in future work. 8 Conclusions and suggestions for future work We have presented a scheme for sharing resource allocations between guaranteed performance connections in computer networks.

These filters 10 perform an application-level transformation of one or more streams. A multiplexing filter could perform a function similar to the resource sharing mechanisms described in this paper by taking in streams from upstream nodes and multiplexing them on to a single output stream.

Reference-contexts: As can be seen in Table 1, once the threshold has been reached, no tests have to be performed for new channels in the group. This simple example shows how resource sharing improves scalability for large conferences. For example, if the Rate-Controlled Static Priority (RCSP) scheduling algorithm <ref> [19] </ref> is used, a channel is assigned a static priority and admission control algorithms ensure that a pre-specified delay bound is met for each priority level. To implement resource sharing, we substitute the group specification for the individual channel specifications in some or all of the tests.
