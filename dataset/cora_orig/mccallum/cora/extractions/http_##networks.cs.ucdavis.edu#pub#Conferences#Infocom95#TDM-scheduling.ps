Abstract: A passive-star-based, broadcast-and-select, local lightwave network which can support a limited number of WDM channels (on the order of ten), but serve a much larger number of nodes (a few tens or hundreds), is considered. Each node is equipped with one tunable transmitter and one fixed receiver, and each WDM channel is operated in a TDM fashion for carrying packet traffic. An important challenge is to allocate bandwidth to the node pairs when traffic flow between them is non-uniform, while also accommodating an important device constraint, viz. large transceiver tuning latency. Under such a scenario, this paper addresses the problem of determining optimum transmission schedules which can, in turn, minimize the network-wide mean packet delay. Specifically, a novel suite of algorithms for load balancing on a WDM/TDM local lightwave network are developed. Our approach exploits well-known results from scheduling theory to create good transmission schedules on such a network. The algo rithms are evaluated via both analysis and simulation.

Reference-contexts: schedule which allocates slots to node pairs such that the number of slots which each pair, ij (0 i; j N 1), receives is proportional to T ij , reduces to the well-studied problem of task allocation on a set of processors (referred to as load balancing in the literature <ref> [21] </ref> [22]). The multichannel scheduling problem is analogous to having W processors and N tasks, with the length of task j defined to be j = i=0 T ij (which is the total intensity of traffic that node j receives). <p> This can be represented graphically by a Gantt Chart (see Figure 3). While task scheduling with arbitrary W is provably NP-hard, there are many efficient approximation algorithms. The best polynomially-bounded approximation algorithm is the MULTIFIT algorithm <ref> [21] </ref>, which is based on the First-Fit Decreasing (FFD) algorithm. Given a set of tasks, their respective lengths, a number of processors, and a time bound f , FFD returns the minimum number of processors needed to schedule the tasks so that they all finish before time f . <p> This lowest value and its associated schedule is the output of MULTIFIT. Thus, MULTIFIT not only attempts to schedule the tasks in as small a time frame as possible, but it does so while minimizing the number of processors needed. In <ref> [21] </ref>, the authors rigorously prove that MULTIFIT is guaranteed to return a schedule with a value of f that is no more than 1.22 times greater than the optimal value of f .

Reference-contexts: which allocates slots to node pairs such that the number of slots which each pair, ij (0 i; j N 1), receives is proportional to T ij , reduces to the well-studied problem of task allocation on a set of processors (referred to as load balancing in the literature [21] <ref> [22] </ref>). The multichannel scheduling problem is analogous to having W processors and N tasks, with the length of task j defined to be j = i=0 T ij (which is the total intensity of traffic that node j receives). <p> In [21], the authors rigorously prove that MULTIFIT is guaranteed to return a schedule with a value of f that is no more than 1.22 times greater than the optimal value of f . In <ref> [22] </ref>, the authors prove that the algorithm can be implemented to run in O (N log (W N )) time. 9 Since MULTIFIT works only with integral values for task lengths, the traffic matrix T must be normalized such that each of its elements is an integer 6 .

Reference-contexts: A packet's queueing delay is defined as the amount of time from the packet's arrival until that packet begins transmission, and this quantity is derived on a per-node basis. In <ref> [23] </ref>, the authors derive the transform of the queue length at a node accessing a TDM channel in which it has one or more slots allocated contiguously. <p> It is assumed that each node maintains a separate queue for each channel that it transmits on, to eliminate head-of-line blocking.

Reference-contexts: The future holds the promise of faster tunable filters, including the imminent availability of Liquid Crystal Fabry-Perot filters, that have switching speeds on the order of several microseconds or less <ref> [25] </ref>. According to the results presented above, these filters used in conjunction with tuning-latency pipelining will make 23 24; W = 4; = 0:25, and L = 5. high-throughput packet switching feasible on a WDM-based local lightwave network.
