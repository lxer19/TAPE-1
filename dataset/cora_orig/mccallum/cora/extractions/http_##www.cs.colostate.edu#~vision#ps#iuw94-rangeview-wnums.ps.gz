Abstract: Automatic Target Recognition Results Abstract The Rangeview software system presented here addresses two significant issues in the development and deployment of an Automatic Target Recognizer: visualization of progress of the recognizer in finding a target, and verification by an operator of the correctness of the match. The system combines range imagery from a LADAR device with optical imagery from a color CCD camera and/or FLIR sensor to display a three-dimensional representation of the scene and the target model. Range imagery creates a partial three-dimensional representation of the scene. Optical imagery is mapped onto this partial three-dimensional representation. Output from the ATR is registered in three dimensions with the scene. Recognized targets are displayed in correct spatial relation to the scene, and the registered scene and target may be visually inspected from any viewpoint.

Reference-contexts: A pseudo-color option is also available to the user, as well as several color schemes described below. Figure 2 shows the same data from a different viewpoint. A picture of the interactive viewer controls can be found elsewhere in these proceedings <ref> [ Beveridge et al., 1994a ] </ref> . Display of the range data in three-dimensional space gives the user a more complete representation of the spatial configuration of the data. Interactive control of viewing parameters allows the user to examine the range data from many different viewpoints at any magnification level. <p> due to high thermal intensity (such as the tank) and has dull, unsaturated data 2 (d) FLIR image superimposed on three-dimensional range data 3 (gray) colors in areas of low thermal intensity. 4 Object Models The system is currently being developed in parallel with an Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) system <ref> [ Beveridge et al., 1994a ] </ref> which uses the range, thermal, and color images. The ATR system will automatically hypothesize matches between the scene and object models, and iteratively refine the three-dimensional geometric relationship between the model and the multisensor imagery [ Schwick-erath and Beveridge, 1994 ] .

Reference-contexts: This made it possible to display the source images and models within Rangeview, select registration points, and immediately view the results. Rangeview is currently being used on LADAR, FLIR and color CCD data collected at Fort Carson in November of 1993 <ref> [ Beveridge et al., 1994b ] </ref> . This data includes multiple frame LADAR sequences taken at evenly spaced time intervals. Rangeview provides the capability to display these frames as an animated loop.
