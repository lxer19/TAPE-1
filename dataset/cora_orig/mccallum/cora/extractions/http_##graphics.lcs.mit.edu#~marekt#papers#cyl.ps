Title: Smallest Enclosing Cylinders Extended Abstract  
Author: Elmar Schomer Jurgen Sellen Marek Teichmann Chee Yap 
Date: July 14, 1995  
Abstract: This paper addresses the complexity of computing the smallest-radius infinite cylinder that encloses an input set of n points in 3-space. We show that the problem can be solved in time O(n 4 log O(1) n) in an algebraic complexity model. We also achieve a time of O(n 4 L (L)) in a bit complexity model. These and several other results highlight a general linearization technique which transforms non-linear problems into some higher dimensional but linear problems. The technique is reminiscent of the use of Plucker coordinates, and is used here in conjunction with Megiddo's parametric searching. We further report on experimental work comparing an exact with a numerical strategy.

Reference-contexts: The above results uses Megiddo's parametric search and a new parallel convex hull algorithm in <ref> [AGR] </ref>. But the linearization technique turns out to be essential and, we believe, has wider applicability. The heart of both approximation and parametric search algorithms is a decision scheme for a fixed optimatization parameter. <p> Note that the presented techniques apply as well to the restricted setting (P2). We shall use the parametric search paradigm in its general form (see eg. [AST] for a detailed description). We also need a deterministic parallel convex hull algorithm. Here, we use the recent result of <ref> [AGR] </ref>: for dimension d 4, there is an algorithm with time O (log n) and work O (n bd=2c log c (dd=2ebd=2c) n), for some con stant c &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: Here the task is, given a physical object, to verify its conformance to tolerance specifications by taking probes of its surface. The cylinder is one of the basic objects addressed by the ASME tolerancing standards <ref> [Asme] </ref>. In industry, highly specialized, expensive equipment (called Coordinate Measurement Machine or CMM) is used to perform these probes automatically.

Reference-contexts: This is equivalent to the existence of a common intersection of the halfs-paces H c and the manifold M . The intersection H = c2I is a convex polytope of complexity O (n 2 ), and can be constructed in the same time bound by Chazelle's result <ref> [Ch] </ref>. In order to intersect H with M , we triangulate H into O (n 2 ) simplices.

Reference-contexts: The linearization technique has been used in other papers. E.g., [MS, YY]. The maximin counterpart of (P2) has nice applications in robotics. It was recently solved by parametric search in time O (n log 4 n) <ref> [Fo] </ref>.

In this paper, we extend these principles to a more general framework, here called linearization. We give this an abstract formulation.

Reference-contexts: Remark 1 Due to the possible quadratic number of local minima, this result may be optimal. It is an open question whether problem (P2) belongs to the class of n 2 -hard problems introduced in <ref> [GO] </ref>. The above technique extends to problem (P1). In this case, we consider - w.l.o.g. axis lines that are not parallel to the plane z = 0.

Concrete geometrical properties have first been investigated in [Pa], with focus on the decision problem to determine if there exists a cylinder with radius r = 1 (a unit cylinder) which encloses the input points.

Reference-contexts: Exact Approx imation Parametric search is an ingenious technique to design optimization algorithms in the algebraic model of computing. Introduced in <ref> [Me] </ref>, it has been applied to numerous optimization problems. But while low-dimensional problems like (P2) often possess simple algebraic characterizations, the algebraic structure of problem (P1) is much more involved. Its solution requires the calculation of roots of polynomials with high degree.

Reference-contexts: Thus, we seek the minimum of a composed function f ffi g. Accordingly, we choose an optimization technique which only requires function evaluations but not to compute derivatives. This technique the standard downhill simplex algorithm as described in <ref> [PTVF] </ref> tries to follow the direction of steepest descent. It is applied in two layers, to compute the minimum of f and (recursively) that of g. For a given start axis, the optimization method converges to some local minimum.

Reference-contexts: Each of these simplices can be tested for intersection with M separately in constant time if we assume an algebraic model of computing, and in time O ((L)) if we assume a bit model <ref> [Re] </ref>. (Note here that M is a semi-algebraic set and the above test corresponds to deciding the sat isfiability for a system of polynomial equations and inequalities.) Concluding, we get a decision algorithm that runs in time O (n 2 ) / O ((L)n 2 ) in an algebraic / bit <p> Further, with O (n bd=2c ) processors, the test for intersection of H with M can be done in constant time in an algebraic model (resp., a real RAM, see <ref> [Re] </ref>).

In contrast to the previous application, n is small but high numerical accuracy is important <ref> [Ya] </ref>. 1.2 Contributions of Paper We summarize four areas of contribution. (I) We design efficient algorithms for the smallest cylinder problem: Theorem 1 The problem (P1) can be solved in time: 1 (i) O (n 4 log O (1) n) in an algebraic model; and (ii) O (L (L)n 4 ) <p> In our application, we need to transform our original problem into some suitable versions of Problem (D) and give efficient linearizations. (IV) Finally, in view of considerable interest in implementation of these algorithms <ref> [Ya] </ref>, we report on some experimental work using a heuristic approach a "local" numerical optimization technique, implemented in C. Our heuristic seems to be quite effective, as verified against exact answers.
