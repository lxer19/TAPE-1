Reference-contexts: Let C be a cyclic d-polytope with the vertex set V = fv 1 ; v 2 ; : : : ; v n g. From the combinatorial equivalence to C (n; d), we obtain (see <ref> [1] </ref>) that C is simplicial and that there is a total ordering of V , say, v 1 &lt; v 2 &lt; : : : &lt; v n and called a vertex array, that satisfies Gale's Evenness Condition (GEC): a d element subset Y of V determines a facet of C

Reference-contexts: A subpolytope of P is the convex hull of a subset of its vertex set. For other elementary properties of P , we refer to <ref> [2] </ref>. A d-polytope P is neighbourly if every [d=2] vertices of P determine a face of P . A well known family of neighbourly d-polytopes are the cyclic d-polytopes.

Reference-contexts: We recall the following elementary fact from <ref> [3] </ref> or [6], Ex. 2.8. Proposition. If (F ; X) and (F 0 ; X) are facet systems of convex d-polytopes then F F 0 implies F = F 0 .

Reference-contexts: Sturmfels <ref> [5] </ref> that states that if every subpolytope of a cyclic d-polytope C is cyclic with respect to the original vertex array then there is an arc of order d in IE d that contains the vertices of C. Corollary.
