Title: Analyzing Social Network Structures in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with Choice and Refusal  
Author: Mark D. Smucker E. Ann Stanley Dan Ashlock 
Date: 15 December 1994  
Abstract: University of Wisconsin-Madison, Department of Computer Sciences Technical Report CS-TR-94-1259 Abstract The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with Choice and Refusal (IPD/CR) [46] is an extension of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with evolution that allows players to choose and to refuse their game partners. From individual behaviors, behavioral population structures emerge. In this report, we examine one particular IPD/CR environment and document the social network methods used to identify population behaviors found within this complex adaptive system. In contrast to the standard homogeneous population of nice cooperators, we have also found metastable populations of mixed strategies within this environment. In particular, the social networks of interesting populations and their evolution are examined.

Reference-contexts: In Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma two players repeatedly play each other. The restriction on the payoffs, (H + L)=2 &lt; C, prevents two Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma players from obtaining an average payoff greater than cooperation by alternating cooperation and defection. When this condition does not hold, a relationship Angeline <ref> [1] </ref> termed non-mutual cooperation gives higher scores than mutual cooperation. In most of this paper we use a standard Prisoner's Dilemma payoff matrix, but in section 8 we briefly explore non-mutual 2 the payoff of the left side of the comma. <p> Populations either have high or low degree. We can speculate that the peaks in the maximum degree are from latching at 3, from stars and connected centers at 13, and at 30 from R&B and full nice cooperation. 8 Non-Mutual Cooperation Angeline <ref> [1] </ref> recently reported on a study in which he relaxed the (L + H)=2 &lt; C constraint on the payoffs in the Prisoner's Dilemma payoff matrix.

Reference-contexts: Further reviews of Prisoner's Dilemma research can be found in <ref> [2, 7, 6, 36] </ref>. 1.2 Previous Research The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with Choice and Refusal (IPD/CR) is a model in which agents may choose and refuse interactions based on expected payoffs from the other players and thus allows the study of a more realistic but greatly more complicated system. <p> Whereas in Axelrod's and Miller's experiments, reciprocation of defection is necessary for the evolution of cooperation, in IPD/CR a population of players who always cooperate can use choice and refusal to survive invasion by players who always defect. While previous IPD/CR research <ref> [46, 2] </ref> has primarily focused on general trends of many runs over different parameter settings, this paper will focus on examining what is happening in specific populations to produce seemingly evolutionarily metastable results. <p> The change in length 4 of interaction is only one consequence of adding choice and refusal to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, and other effects have been reported in <ref> [2, 46] </ref>. The IPD/CR simulations have shown to produce fairly distinct levels of evolutionarily metastable behavior that show up visually in the graphs of the populations' average fitness versus generation, where an individual's fitness is defined to be its average payoff. <p> This tendency for IPD/CR populations to cluster in average payoff space is discussed in <ref> [2, 46] </ref>. 1.3 Population Structure Population structures describe the way in which a population of individuals interact with one another. Researchers have tended to look at either spatial or behavioral structures. Both types of structures can either emerge from or be imposed on the population. <p> In Ashlock et. al <ref> [2] </ref> and Stanley et. al [46] we also used a Mealy machine formulation and have found that the behavior of IPD/CR is not terribly sensitive to this representation issue. <p> Low average age of individuals implies that there is a constantly changing population, and this allows for drift in unexpressed behavior. Table 1 describes the IPD/CR environment examined in this paper. A study of other IPD/CR parameter settings is reported in <ref> [2] </ref>. 3 Understanding Population Behaviors Despite the simple formulation of IPD/CR, the population behavior which results is very complex, and varies significantly between runs with different random seeds. <p> The population average payoff increases over a series of generations until it gets very close to 3.0, and then drops to 2.7, or lower, in a single generation. When this behavior is observed in the population average payoff, the population structure Ashlock et al. <ref> [2] </ref> called Raquel and the Bobs (R&B) is often occuring. Prior to the increase, there are one or more generations of a typical latching population. <p> We plan to explore the impact of different spatial structures on the behavior of IPD/CR. The partner selection mechanism in IPD/CR is a strong determinant of the individual's behaviors. We have used expected payoffs, with exact ordering of potential partners, and a sharp tolerance cutoff. In Ashlock et al. <ref> [2] </ref> we presented preliminary results on the impact of allowing two of the parameters, t and !, to evolve along with the finite state machines. These simulations indicated that many of the same social networks continue to emerge, and wallflower ecologies are very common.

Axelrod was the first to use a genetic algorithm to evolve complex strategies to play the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma [4, 5], and soon after that Fujiki and Dickinson implemented a system that evolved LISP coded strategies to play the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma [16]. <p> Muhlenbein studied the evolution of cooperation in various population structures and demonstrated that cooperation emerged sooner with an implementation based on Darwin's Continent Cycle than in other population structures [39]. Axelrod studied the idea of clustering cooperators together so that they can invade a population of defectors <ref> [3] </ref>. A commonly implemented spatial structure is a two dimensional cellular automata where each cell is a player, and that player's interactions with the other members of the population is limited to either its four or eight closest neighbors.

Reference-contexts: Fogel [13] has also evolved populations of automata that play the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma using the technique of evolutionary programming [12, 15] and studied the effects of modifying the payoff matrix while still maintaining the proper relations of the payoffs. 3 Marks <ref> [37] </ref> discusses and reviews the use of automata in repeated games including the work he has done on Prisoner's Dilemma with genetic algorithms.

Reference-contexts: Miller used a genetic algorithm to coevolve populations of finite state machines <ref> [38] </ref> which played round robin tournaments of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with varying amounts of noise, where noise meant that with a certain probability an individual's actions were misinterpreted by his partner/opponent. <p> iteration, IPD/CR allows players to choose and refuse player interactions at each iteration. 2.1 Choice and Refusal The players in the IPD/CR simulations studied here consist of a sixteen state Moore machine which is coded as a one hundred forty-eight bit string for use by the genetic algorithm as in <ref> [38] </ref>. In Ashlock et. al [2] and Stanley et. al [46] we also used a Mealy machine formulation and have found that the behavior of IPD/CR is not terribly sensitive to this representation issue.

Reference-contexts: Many researchers have studied the effects of limiting interactions between social agents by imposing spatial structure on Prisoner's Dilemma populations. Muhlenbein studied the evolution of cooperation in various population structures and demonstrated that cooperation emerged sooner with an implementation based on Darwin's Continent Cycle than in other population structures <ref> [39] </ref>. Axelrod studied the idea of clustering cooperators together so that they can invade a population of defectors [3].

Reference-contexts: Nowak and May ran Prisoner's Dilemma on a grid and produced interesting patterns <ref> [40] </ref>, but Huberman and Glance criticized Nowak and May's synchronous updating of the cellular automata in nature synchronous updating does not correspond to reality and showed that an asynchronous updating causes the patterns to disappear [26].

Reference-contexts: Guppies are less willing to interact with guppies who have previously defected by hanging back during predator inspection; a guppy whose partner hangs back is in much greater danger of being eaten. Friends may defect by passing on sensitive information, missing meetings, and many other ways. Orbell and Dawes <ref> [41] </ref> argue that, since cooperation helps increase total accumulated wealth, and partner selection enhances cooperation, it is to the benefit of society as a whole to evolve social structures which allow individuals to choose their partners.

Reference-contexts: Whereas in Axelrod's and Miller's experiments, reciprocation of defection is necessary for the evolution of cooperation, in IPD/CR a population of players who always cooperate can use choice and refusal to survive invasion by players who always defect. While previous IPD/CR research <ref> [46, 2] </ref> has primarily focused on general trends of many runs over different parameter settings, this paper will focus on examining what is happening in specific populations to produce seemingly evolutionarily metastable results. <p> The change in length 4 of interaction is only one consequence of adding choice and refusal to the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, and other effects have been reported in <ref> [2, 46] </ref>. The IPD/CR simulations have shown to produce fairly distinct levels of evolutionarily metastable behavior that show up visually in the graphs of the populations' average fitness versus generation, where an individual's fitness is defined to be its average payoff. <p> This tendency for IPD/CR populations to cluster in average payoff space is discussed in <ref> [2, 46] </ref>. 1.3 Population Structure Population structures describe the way in which a population of individuals interact with one another. Researchers have tended to look at either spatial or behavioral structures. Both types of structures can either emerge from or be imposed on the population. <p> In Ashlock et. al [2] and Stanley et. al <ref> [46] </ref> we also used a Mealy machine formulation and have found that the behavior of IPD/CR is not terribly sensitive to this representation issue. The Moore machine is used to play the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and is the only part of the player structure which evolves.

Reference-contexts: m either by playing a Prisoner's Dilemma game or by being rejected, n updates its expected payoff of m via the following assignment rule, (mjn) !(mjn) + (1 !)U ; where U denotes the payoff n received from m and ! is the "memory" weight. 2.2 Evolution A genetic algorithm <ref> [23, 19, 48] </ref> is used to coevolve the population of players. For this experiment, each generation consists of one IPD/CR tournament. We used a population size of thirty.

Reference-contexts: For example, one dimensional populations could exist along a beach front, two dimensional structures often model simple plant populations and land roving animals, and three dimensional structures can be found populations which live in trees or the ocean. Spatial distribution has been hypothesized as a cause of speciation <ref> [49] </ref>. Behavioral structures describe the behavior between individuals in contrast to simply considering the fact that two individuals separated by a great distance tend not to be able to directly interact. Individuals can be spatially separated in human organizations but be close in a behavioral structure.
