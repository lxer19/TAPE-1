Abstract: In an earlier paper [10], we studied a generalized Rao bound for ordered orthogonal arrays and (T; M; S)-nets. In this paper, we extend this to a coding-theoretic approach to ordered orthogonal arrays. Using a certain association scheme, we prove a MacWilliams-type theorem for linear ordered orthogonal arrays and linear ordered codes as well as a linear programming bound for the general case. We include some tables which compare this bound against two previously known bounds for ordered orthogonal arrays. Finally we show that, for even strength, the LP bound is always at least as strong as the generalized Rao bound.

Reference-contexts: 1 The Ordered Hamming Scheme In 1987, Niederreiter [13] introduced (T; M; S)-nets, which are low discrepancy point sets in the unit cube [0; 1) S . These are useful for quasi-Monte Carlo methods such as numerical integration and have received considerable attention in recent literature (see <ref> [2] </ref> for a survey). In [8], Lawrence gave a combinatorial characterization of (T; M; S)-nets in terms of objects he called generalized orthogonal arrays. Ordered orthogonal arrays (see, e.g., Edel and Bierbrauer [4]) are equivalent to generalized orthogonal arrays. <p> Since their invention by Niederreiter [13] in 1987 , there has been a considerable amount of research done on (T; M; S)-nets. For a good summary of known results, see [12] and <ref> [2] </ref>. The key result for us is the following theorem, due to Lawrence [8], which shows that (T; M; S)-nets correspond to ordered orthogonal arrays with t = `. <p> We now present two new bounds that we proved using this linear pro gramming approach. 18 Theorem 4.1 The largest value of s for which a ternary (1; 5; s)-net exists is s = 8. Proof. In <ref> [2] </ref>, it is indicated that a ternary (1; 5; 8)-net exists and that no ternary (1; 5; 11)-net exists. The results in our paper [10] show that no ternary (1; 5; 10)-net exists. The only value remaining, therefore, is s = 9. <p> Thus, no ternary (1; 5; 9)-net exists. The computation, performed by R. Bixby at Rice University, involves a linear program having 714 variables and constraints. Theorem 4.2 The largest value of s for which a ternary (1; 7; s)-net exists is s = 7. Proof. From the tables in <ref> [2] </ref>, we know that a ternary (1; 7; 7)-net exists and that no ternary (1; 7; 9)-net exists. While the generalized Rao bound only tells us that s 9 in this case, the linear programming bound rules out a ternary (1; 7; 8)-net. <p> For example, by reducing ` to 1, we end up with the usual linear programming bound for (ordinary) orthogonal arrays. This approach was used to obtain the bounds in <ref> [2] </ref>. It is an interesting question to ask how the LP bounds vary as ` is decreased. As an example relating to Theorem 4.1, we used MAPLE to show that LP fl (4; 9; 2; 3) = 245:25. <p> Note that the smaller LP has only 54 variables and constraints, as compared to 714 in the larger one. In Table 1, we compare three lower bounds on the number of rows in an ordered orthogonal array. The first bound is the one used in <ref> [2] </ref>; i.e., the LP bound for the orthogonal array formed by taking the first column from each of the s groups. The second bound is the generalized Rao bound from [10]. <p> Using Theorem 2.2, this implies that there is no binary (3; 11; 10)-net, thus improving the bounds given in <ref> [2] </ref> and [10]. Our last result shows that, for t even, the linear programming bound is always at least as strong as the generalized Rao bound proved in [10]. The argument we use is a straightforward adaptation of the proof of Theorem 5.2 in [9]. <p> OA LP bound: linear programming bound for orthogonal array formed by the set of first columns of an OOA (used in <ref> [2] </ref>). GR bound: Generalized Rao bound derived in [10].

In fact, the pair ! k (`; v) form a pair of dual association schemes (see Theorem 2.9 in <ref> [3] </ref>). This will allow us to extend concepts from linear coding theory to these schemes. 1.3 A subscheme of a product scheme We now consider the s-fold product of the scheme (X; A) = ! A denote the Bose-Mesner algebra of (X; A). <p> In fact, the association scheme ! H (s; `; v) has a dual: it is simply the group of characters of Y with relations determined by the behaviour of the various eigenvectors (see Section 2.6 in <ref> [3] </ref>). This scheme also has one relation for each shape e. <p> We say A is an orthogonal array of strength at least t if A is balanced with respect to any subset of t of its columns. The following standard lemma will be useful to us. Lemma 2.1 (Cf. <ref> [3, Theorem 4.4] </ref>) Let A be an array over Z v with k columns and let C denote the set of rows of A, viewed as a subset of Z k v . <p> Then x T E f x 0 (5) for each shape f since each E f is a symmetric idempotent matrix. This is the standard approach to Delsarte's linear programming bound <ref> [3, Thm. 3.3] </ref>. Let a be the inner distribution vector of C. This is simply the vector of coefficients of the weight enumerator.

For our purposes, it is convenient to choose V = Z v , but the analysis can be done using any abelian group and most of the results will hold for any alphabet. <p> Hence the characters of this group yield a complete set of eigenvectors for each graph G i in A (see Lemma 12.9.2 in <ref> [5] </ref>). We now compute the eigenvalues of the graphs G i belonging to a par ticular character a . Let a = a 1 a 2 a ` 2 Z ` v . Let A i denote the adjacency matrix of G i in ! k (`; v). <p> A well-known formula for the second eigenmatrix Q = jXjP 1 of the association scheme (see, e.g., Lemma 2.2.1 (iv) in [1] or p. 226 in <ref> [5] </ref>) is Using the above, it is easy to prove that m j P ji = P ij k i ; showing Q = P . That is, the scheme (X; A) is formally self-dual.

Reference-contexts: Graph-theoretically, each element of A s is a union of graphs from B and admits Sym (f1; 2; : : : ; sg) as a group of automorphisms. Applying a result of Godsil <ref> [6] </ref>, we have Theorem 1.6 (Y; A s ) is an association scheme which is also formally self-dual. <p> Since I S can be partitioned into v k elementary intervals of volume v k , we must have jN j v MT and jPj v MT for a (T; M; S)-net N and a (T; M; S)-packing P. 3 MacWilliams Theorem A recent result of Godsil <ref> [6] </ref> enables us to write down MacWilliams-type identities for any association scheme constructed in the manner described 13 in Section 1.3.

Reference-contexts: If 8 B denotes the subset of all such products where M i 2 A, then B forms a basis of 01-matrices for B . That is, (Y; B) is an association scheme. (This fact, attributable to Kusumoto <ref> [7] </ref>, is widely used but poorly documented.) Clearly jBj = (` + 1) s . The next step is to form a subscheme (or "fusion scheme") of (Y; B) by identifying relations in the same orbit under the symmetric group on the s coordinates.
