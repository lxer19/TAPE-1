Abstract: This work addresses the problem of real time network resource management. Resources are represented as Resource Virtual Machines, which exhibit similar characteristics as actual resources with respect to service time, QOS offered, frequency of breakdowns, cost of each service offered, response latency, etc. The architecture is based on distributed computing principles and optimizes usage of network resources and computing resources required for this purpose (bandwidth and CPU cycles, respectively). Flexibility of high-level functionality and overhead are balanced to the best extent possible. The implemented Realtime Resource Management Protocol (RRMP) is designed to treat the static and dynamic characteristics of resources differently. Users of these resources are given the right to choose the priority of the job, class of resources required, and QOS requirement. Priority is a measure of the urgency of the job to be completed, based on which the system decides how much of the QOS can be sacrificed for the sake of timeliness and where the job should be put in the waiting list. Thus, an effort is made to share decision-making ability. The general work plan is to associate a state with each resource and keep track of state transitions to enable decision making.

Reference-contexts: While real time response is not always important in the latter case, in the former case real time reporting is an additional crucial factor. A Management Middleware with such capabilities is presented in <ref> [1] </ref>. This work outlines a framework for application-oriented management of network resources, proposing an exchange of appropriate Application Management Information between management nodes in different domains in order to better assist the application's task. <p> Our own model satisfies Application requirements by selecting appropriate resources, dynamically managing resources, relating QoS requirements to network usage, and providing additional mechanisms to improve QoS characteristics as service offers to the application or user. This model is described in detail in <ref> [1] </ref>, where we present an initial prototype of the proposed architecture using the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA)[12] and Services that enable interactions between the system's entities; we focus on the architecture and communication aspects rather than the appropriate algorithms associated with decision making. <p> This has information about the class of the resource, the location, QOS offered, the unique ID of the resource and the Event it generates to inform about its status. The System architecture is detailed in <ref> [1] </ref>; Naming, Event, and Trading Services are implemented as defined by the CORBA specifications. We have used them for carrying out the interactions among the above entities.

Reference-contexts: Finally, `resource inspectors' of the same type (controlling the same type of resource) constitute a logical communication backbone. 1 The work presented here is built upon this model, several aspects of which are detailed in <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. This paper focuses on the implementation of, and test results for, a reporting mechanism suitable for real-time application management when dynamic changes are taken into account for decision making.

Reference-contexts: Resource Virtual Machines are administered by Resource Inspectors, a sort of Agents according to Management terminology, which run locally with (or close to) the resource and periodically monitors the resource.

The results of this research are expected to assist applications to integrate resource reservations as well as multicast capabilities. CORBA interfaces are used to overcome the heterogeneity of system-specific control mechanisms.
