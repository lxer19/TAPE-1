Reference-contexts: CHAPTER 2. SYSTEM LANDA 14 2.4 Servers There are 4 types of servers constituting LANDA system: Node Server (NS), Application Server (AS), Data Server (DS) and Header Server (HS). Every server performs its own, well specified functions. For communication, the servers use remote procedure calls (RPC) described in <ref> [2] </ref>, with data encoding according to XDR standard described in [3].

Reference-contexts: Every server performs its own, well specified functions. For communication, the servers use remote procedure calls (RPC) described in [2], with data encoding according to XDR standard described in <ref> [3] </ref>. RPC, which allows to create client-server applications in a standardized way, can use one of the two protocols: * TCP Transmission Control Protocol described in [5], which is a con nection oriented protocol, or * UDP User Datagram Protocol described in [4] which is a connection less protocol.

Though XDR affects speed of communication, it is used to ensure data coherence between heterogenic workstations (which can use different internal representations of data). Node Server runs on every node of the virtual machine.

Reference-contexts: INTERACTION SYSTEM 24 * reading (without deletion) a message from the mailbox of a task (two commands differing in the way the message to be read is specified) The requests (the interface between HCI and ST) are described in details in <ref> [6] </ref>. Additionally, in the future version of IS there wiil be added another request for changing contents of a message that is already present in the mailbox of a task. 3.9 Connecting to an application IS can interact only with an application to which it is connected. <p> Chapter 4 Implementing Super Task Before starting implementation, ST was specified and designed. Two documents were created (in French): * the specification describing in details the principles of ST and the interface between HCI and ST <ref> [6] </ref> * the design describing implementation of every command including modifications of the source code of LANDA itself as well as of the LANDA generic library [7]. The effort has been made to minimize the number of necessary modifications in the source code of LANDA. <p> LANDA * port ST into future version of LANDA * creating missing human computer interface * maintain the source code of ST as well as of the whole LANDA Apart from this report, during the training there were created two other documents, written in French, describing Super Task: the specification <ref> [6] </ref>, and the design [7]. ST has been implemented with a modular structure, where each module performs its own, well specified functions. 36 CHAPTER 5. CONCLUSIONS 37 During the training, the trainee worked with the personnel of LAAS and with the other trainees.
