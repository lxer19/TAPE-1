Abstract: Figure 1: The (3,5) torus knot, a complex periodic 3D curve. (a) The line drawing is nearly useless as a 3D representation. (b) A tubing based on parallel transporting an initial reference frame produces an informative visualization, but is not periodic. (c) The arrow in this closeup exposes the subtle but crucial non-periodic mismatch between the starting and ending parallel-transport frames; this would invalidate any attempt to texture the tube. The methods of this paper provide robust parameterization Abstract We propose a general paradigm for computing optimal coordinate frame fields that may be exploited to visualize curves and surfaces. Parallel-transport framings, which work well for open curves, generally fail to have desirable properties for cyclic curves and for surfaces. We suggest that minimal quaternion measure provides an appropriate heuristic generalization of parallel transport. Our approach differs from minimal-tangential-acceleration approaches due to the addition of sliding ring constraints that fix one frame axis, but allow an axial rotational freedom whose value is varied in the optimization process. Our fundamental tool is the quater-nion Gauss map, a generalization to quaternion space of the tangent map for curves and of the Gauss map for surfaces. The quater-nion Gauss map takes 3D coordinate frame fields for curves and surfaces into corresponding curves and surfaces constrained to the space of possible orientations in quaternion space. Standard optimization tools provide application-specific means of choosing optimal, e.g., length- or area-minimizing, quaternion frame fields in this constrained space. invariant principles for resolving such problems.
