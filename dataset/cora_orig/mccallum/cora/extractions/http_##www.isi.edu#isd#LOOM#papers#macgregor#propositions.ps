Reference-contexts: Proposition P3 can be restated as cardinality (S1, 2). The reified object S1 is sometimes referred to as a role set ( KL-ONE uses this term). Terminologically-oriented description logics such as those found in Loom, CLASSIC <ref> [Borgida 92] </ref> and BACK are unusual in that they allow one to state propositions about role set objects without explicitly representing (reifying) those objects.

Reference-contexts: The "Permutation-Equivalence Assumption" (PEA) generalizes IEA to apply to relations of arbitrary arity. 4 The Qua Relation We next consider the qua (role-as-concept) relationship <ref> [Freeman 81] </ref>. Let us define the class Employee, to be "a person who works for a company", (i.e., Employee is qua-induced by the relation companies). Fred as an instance of Person corresponds to two distinct individuals in the class Employee: Fred-as-IBM-worker and Fred-as-Apple-worker.

Reference-contexts: The consequences of IEA percolate up to the meta level. At the meta level, conceptual objects representing classes of tuples (i.e., relations) are distinct from conceptual objects representing classes of reified tuples. To provide support for NL applications such as PENMAN <ref> [Hovy 90] </ref>, Loom implements a construct called defreified-relation which, upon invocation, defines a pair of meta objects, one denoting a binary relation, and one denoting the corresponding class of reified tuples. Let us name the class of reified companies tuples Workers/companies and name the class of reified workers tuples Companies/workers.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction This paper discusses semantic issues that have surfaced with regard to the representation of propositions in the Loom knowledge representation system <ref> [MacGregor 91a, MacGregor 91b] </ref>. Loom is a terminologically-based KR system (a member of the KL-ONE family). Although KL-ONE embodied some very direct assumptions about how propositional knowledge should be treated [Brachman & Schmolze 95], the terminological logic community has paid relatively little attention to propositional representations in more recent times.
