Reference-contexts: Profit represents an attempt to overcome these difficulties, by providing programming language support for developing applications with such soft real time requirements. Profit is a coordination language <ref> [1] </ref> built on top of the C computation language. The low-level analytic algorithms are implemented using conventional C statements and data structures, and Profit adds the communication, synchronization, multi-threading and timing facilities. Profit is intended for use by sophisticated programmers to construct distributed financial services applications.

Reference-contexts: A formal semantics of the Profit language needs to be developed. The current Profit implementation supports a simplified form of dynamic reconfiguration, to add new securities and portfolio managers and change the composition of portfolios while the system is running. A more elaborate method has been designed <ref> [2] </ref>, but has not been implemented. 7. Acknowledgments Mike Mayer implemented Profit's basic library facility and Vanessa Cole is responsible for the SPLENDORS user interface. George Beltz provided information on the prices feed.

Reference-contexts: This involves real time monitoring of market conditions, execution of strategies using uptodate market conditions information, and updating portfolios on a real time basis to take advantage of the market conditions. This section contains a brief description of Profit. For a more detailed description, see <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. * The work by Tushar Patel is being carried out as a part of his MS Thesis at Columbia University. 2 There are three main concepts in Profit facets, objects and processes (see figure 2-1): A facet is a minimal unit of data and control.

Reference-contexts: Agents can contain arbitrary knowledge and they may carry out arbitrary computations. In fact, the knowledge in the agents could be updated dynamically. For example, the thresholds used by certain rules in agents could be updated as the market fluctuates to capture changes in trends <ref> [5] </ref>. Agents are implemented in SPLENDORS using Profit facets. Agents are conceptually associated with securities in portfolios making it possible for different portfolios containing the same security to have 6 different agents.
