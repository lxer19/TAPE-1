Abstract: This paper introduces a new concept learning system. Its main features are presented and discussed. The controlled use of redundancy is one of the main characteristics of the program. Redundancy, in this system, is used to deal with several types of uncertainty existing in real domains. The problem of the use of redundancy is addressed, namely its influence on accuracy and comprehensibility. Extensive experiments were carried out on three real world domains. These experiments showed clearly the advantages of the use of redundancy.

Reference-contexts: The same point could be raised in YAILS with respect to the combination of different rules. In [13] we present an experimental analysis of several different combination strategies. The work by Brazdil and Torgo <ref> [2] </ref> is also related to this. It consisted of combining several knowledge bases obtained by different algorithms into one knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: The system is able to use different set ups of these mechanisms which contributes to the good flexibility of the program. The following sections explain these two strategies in more detail. 3.1 Redundancy Most existing algorithms like for instance, AQ [10] and CN2 <ref> [4] </ref>, use a covering strategy during learning. This means that the algorithm attempts to cover all known examples and that whenever some example has been covered it is removed. These systems would consider a rule useless if it covered examples that are already covered by other rules. <p> Their goal is to make this set empty. In YAILS this is not the case thus enabling the production of redundant rules. The main differences stated between YAILS and AQ type programs also hold in comparison to CN2 <ref> [4] </ref> with the addition that CN2 is non-incremental. In effect CN2 has a search strategy that is similar to AQ with the difference of using ID3 like information measures to find the attributes to use in specialisation. STAGGER [14] system uses weights to characterise its concept descriptions.

Reference-contexts: The main differences are that STAGGER learns only one concept (ex. rain / not rain) and uses only boolean attributes. YAILS differs from STAGGER in that it uses redundancy and flexible matching. The work of Gams <ref> [6] </ref> on redundancy clearly showed the advantages of redundancy. In his work Gams used several knowledge bases which were used in parallel to obtain the classification of new instances. This type of redundancy demands a good conflict resolution strategy in order to take advantage of the diversity of opinions.

Reference-contexts: The system is able to use different set ups of these mechanisms which contributes to the good flexibility of the program.

This means that the algorithm attempts to cover all known examples and that whenever some example has been covered it is removed. These systems would consider a rule useless if it covered examples that are already covered by other rules. <p> Redundancy can be a good method to fight the problem of "unknowns", but the success depends also on other characteristics of the dataset. 5 Relations to other work YAILS differs from the AQ family <ref> [10] </ref> programs in several aspects. AQ type algorithms perform unidirectional search. In general they start with an empty complex and proceed by adding conditions. YAILS uses a bidirectional search. AQ - type programs use a covering search strategy.

The same point could be raised in YAILS with respect to the combination of different rules. In <ref> [13] </ref> we present an experimental analysis of several different combination strategies.

Reference-contexts: In effect CN2 has a search strategy that is similar to AQ with the difference of using ID3 like information measures to find the attributes to use in specialisation. STAGGER <ref> [14] </ref> system uses weights to characterise its concept descriptions. In STAGGER each condition has two weights attached to it. These weights are a kind of counters of correct and incorrect matching of the condition.

Reference-contexts: This means that the algorithm attempts to cover all known examples and that whenever some example has been covered it is removed. These systems would consider a rule useless if it covered examples that are already covered by other rules. AQ 16 <ref> [15] </ref> uses a set of weights to remove this type of rules (considered redundant rules). This method is able to produce simpler theories than if the redundant rules were left in. YAILS does not follow this method. <p> The utility of one rule is calculated as the ratio of the number of examples uniquely covered by the rule, divided by the total number of examples covered by the rule (this measure is basically the same as the u-weights used in <ref> [15] </ref>). <p> Section 4 presents the results obtained with several datasets using different classification strategies showing the effect of redundancy on both accuracy and comprehensibility. 3.2 Weighted Flexible Matching Systems like AQ 16 <ref> [15] </ref> that strive to eliminate redundancy become more sensitive to uncertainty inherent in real world domains. A small number of rules means that few alternatives exist when classifying the examples.
