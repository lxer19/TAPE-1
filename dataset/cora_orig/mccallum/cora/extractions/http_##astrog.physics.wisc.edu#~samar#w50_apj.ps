Reference: <editor> In X-rays, Watson et al. </editor> <title> (1983) found two bright diffuse lobes with the EINSTEIN satellite, symmetrically displaced east and west of SS433, and aligned along the axis of W50. Each lobe is visible from ~ 15 0 to ~ 40 0 from SS433, with emission peaking at about 35 0 , coinciding with the optical filaments, and lying near the base of its respective `radio lobe'. Assuming a thermal origin for the X-ray emission, </title> <note> the temperature of the radiating plasma was found to vary from 4 keV to 1.5 keV as one moves outward along the lobes. </note>
Reference: <author> Watson et al. </author> <title> (1983) did not, however, exclude a synchrotron interpretation of the lobes. </title>
