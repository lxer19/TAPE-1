Abstract: The polynomial-time retiming algorithms that were developed in the eighties assumed simple delay models that neglected several timing issues that arise in logic design. Recent retiming algorithms for more comprehensive delay models rely on non-linear formulations and run in worst-case exponential time using branch-and-bound techniques. In this paper, we investigate the retiming problem for edge-triggered circuits under a general delay model that handles load-dependent gate delays, register delays, interconnect delays, and clock skew. We show that in this model the retiming problem can be expressed as a set of integer linear programming constraints that can be solved using general ILP techniques. For the special case where clock skew is monotonic and all registers have equal propagation delays, we give an integer monotonic programming formulation of the retiming problem, and we present an efficient algorithm for solving it. Our algorithm retimes any given edge-triggered circuit to achieve a specified clock period in O(V 3 F ) steps, where V is the number of logic gates in the circuit and F is bounded by the number of registers in the circuit. A straightforward extension of our algorithm determines a minimum clock period retiming in O(V 3 F lg V ) steps.

Reference-contexts: This situation can occur when designing with standard cells such as the ones in the CMOS3 cell library <ref> [2] </ref>. As a result, the propagation delays of paths can be reduced by extending the paths to include additional logic gates. Another situation where path delays change in effect non-monotonically arises when we consider clock skew.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The retiming transformation optimizes synchronous circuits by relocating their storage elements without affecting their functionality. For edge-triggered circuits, researchers have presented polynomial-time retiming algorithms that assume relatively simple delay models <ref> [4, 5, 11] </ref>. Although these delay models are good enough for system-level timing optimization, they are inaccurate when applied at the gate level, because they do not take into account the timing effects of several factors such as varying gate loads, register delays, and clock skew.

We first describe the simple integer monotonic programming problem, an integer programming problem from <ref> [10] </ref> that can be solved using an iterative scheme. We then show that the retiming problem for one-way extendible circuits can be expressed as such a monotonic programming problem. The results are described for one-way end-extendible circuits, and they also hold for one-way begin-extendible circuits. <p> The simple integer monotonic programming problem admits a unique minimum solution x which can be determined by the generic procedure MonoRelax shown in Figure 4 <ref> [10] </ref>. We cast the retiming problem in the form of a simple integer monotonic programming problem and determine a provable upper bound on retiming values which constitute the minimum solution.
