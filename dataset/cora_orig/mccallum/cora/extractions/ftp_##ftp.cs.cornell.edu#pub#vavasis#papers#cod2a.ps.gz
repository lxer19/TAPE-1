Title: Complete Orthogonal Decomposition for Weighted Least Squares  
Author: Patricia D. Hough Stephen A. Vavasis 
Date: March 15, 1995  
Abstract: Consider a full-rank weighted least-squares problem in which the weight matrix is highly ill-conditioned. Because of the ill-conditioning, standard methods for solving least-squares problems, QR factorization and the nullspace method for example, break down. G. W. Stewart established a norm bound for such a system of equations, indicating that it may be possible to find an algorithm that gives an accurate solution. S. A. Vavasis proposed a new definition of stability that is based on this result. He also proposed the NSH algorithm for solving this least-squares problem and showed that it satisfies the new definition of stability. This paper describes a complete orthogonal decomposition algorithm to solve this problem and shows that it is also stable. This new algorithm is simpler and more efficient than the NSH method.

Reference-contexts: The QR factorization in Step 1 is to make the algorithm stable. Solution of least-squares problems via QR factorization with column pivoting was introduced by Golub <ref> [5] </ref>. The term "complete orthogonal decomposition" refers to a factorization of the form QRZ in which Q and Z are orthogonal and R is triangular [6]. Therefore we have chosen this name for the above algorithm, which computes a particular kind of complete orthogonal decomposition. <p> If so, those entries are changed to zeros. Notice that this test requires very little additional work because the usual QR factorization algorithm with column pivoting already monitors the norms of the residual portions of the columns <ref> [5] </ref>. In this way, if there are exact dependences among the rows of A, the algorithm does not miss them. If this numerical test fails to detect exact dependence, then the following stability analysis no longer holds.
