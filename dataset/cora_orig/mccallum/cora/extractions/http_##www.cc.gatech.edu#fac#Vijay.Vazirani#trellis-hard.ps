Abstract: The problem of minimizing the trellis complexity of a code by coordinate permutation is studied. Three measures of trellis complexity are considered: the total number of states, the total number of edges, and the maximum state complexity of the trellis. The problem is proven NP-hard for all three measures, provided the field over which the code is specified is not fixed. We leave open the problem of dealing with the case of a fixed field, in particular GF (2).

Reference-contexts: We leave open the problem of dealing with the case of a fixed field, in particular GF (2). Our proof uses several ideas from the recent breakthrough result of Vardy <ref> [12] </ref> showing the NP-hardness of the problem of computing the minimum distance of a binary linear code thus settling a conjecture of Berlekamp, McEliece and van Tilborg dating back to 1978. In particular, we use his ingenious construction for obtaining MDS codes using Vandermonde matrices. <p> As we shall see, the intractability result of this paper holds for any choice of measure from the above list. 2 3 NP-hardness of Restricted MDS Code Recently, Vardy <ref> [12] </ref> proved that it is NP-hard to find whether or not a given linear code is MDS. We show that the problem remains NP-hard even when restricted to (2k; k)-linear codes; this restricted version of the MDS Code problem will be used to derive the results of the next section. <p> Hence RFFSS is NP hard 2 We can now prove the NP-hardness of RMDSC: Theorem 3.3 For every prime p, Restricted MDS Code is NP-hard. Proof. We will reduce RFFSS to RMDSC using Vardy's construction <ref> [12] </ref>. Let ff 1 ; ff 2 ; : : : ; ff 2r+1 ; fi 2 GF (p 3r ) be an instance of RFFSS. <p> It follows that the minimum number of dependent columns of H is either r + 1 or r + 2. The following lemma by Vardy distinguishes between these two cases: Lemma 3.4 (Vardy <ref> [12] </ref>) H has r + 1 dependent columns iff ff i 1 + ff i 2 + : : : +ff i r = fi for some i 1 ; :::; i r : By Lemma 3.4, the answer to the instance of RFFSS is "no" iff every set of r <p> Hence minimizing the number of edges for the compact form of trellises also remains NP-hard. It is natural to ask whether or not minimizing trellis complexity becomes tractable for a fixed field. We concur with Horn and Kschischang [5] and Vardy <ref> [11, 12] </ref> in the belief that the answer is "no". In particular, we believe that the following problem is NP-hard: Problem: Minimum Width Let GF (q) be a fixed field. Instance: An integer w &gt; 0 and an m fi n matrix H over GF (q).

Note that in the proof of Theorem 4.5, if no k columns of H are dependent then the resulting minimal trellis has no parallel edges. Hence minimizing the number of edges for the compact form of trellises also remains NP-hard.
