Title: A Tradeoff Between Information and Communication in Broadcast Protocols (Revised version) of messages of bounded

Abstract: This paper concerns the message complexity of broadcast in arbitrary point-to-point communication networks. Broadcast is a task initiated by a single processor that wishes to convey a message to all processors in the network. We assume the widely accepted model of communication networks, in which each processor initially knows the identity of its neighbors, but does not know the entire network topology. Although it seems obvious that the number of messages required for broadcast in this model equals the number of links, no proof of this basic fact has been given before. We show that the message complexity of broadcast depends on the exact complexity measure. If messages of unbounded length are counted at unit cost, then broadcast requires fi(jV j) messages, where V is the set of processors in the network. We prove that if one counts messages of bounded length then broadcast requires fi(jEj) messages, where E is the set of edges in the network. Assuming an intermediate model in which each vertex knows the topology of the network in radius 1 from itself, we prove matching upper and lower bounds of The same results hold for the construction of spanning trees, and various other fi(minfjEj; jV j 1+ fi(1)

Reference-contexts: We consider the standard model of distributed computing, which is a point-to-point communication network. The network is modeled by an undirected graph G (V; E) whose vertices represent processors and whose edges represent bidirectional communication links (cf. <ref> [A1, Bu, FL, GHS] </ref>). Communication itself is either synchronous or asynchronous all our results hold for both cases. An elementary message may contain only a constant number of bits and a constant number of vertex identities. Longer messages must be chopped into elementary messages prior to transmission. <p> Thus a system configuration consists of a graph G and an ID-assignment, which is a one-to-one mapping : V ! S. One can distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous network models, as in <ref> [A1] </ref>. For the lower bound, we assume here that communication is synchronous; i.e., communication takes place in "rounds", where processors transmit only in the very beginning of a round and all messages are received by the end of the round. Clearly, the lower bound holds also if communication is asynchronous. <p> An immediate consequence of the marking process used to define G is that all short cycles are disconnected, and hence we have Lemma 5.2: The girth of G satisfies g ( G) 2 + 1. We need the following proposition. Proposition 5.3 <ref> [A1, PS] </ref>: There exists a constant c &gt; 0 such that for any graph G (V; E) and for any k 1 there exists a subgraph G 0 (V; E 0 ) such that 1. jE 0 j O (jV j 1+ c 2.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Broadcast <ref> [DM] </ref> is one of the most fundamental tasks in distributed computing. It is initiated by a single processor, called the source, wishing to distribute a message (the initial message) to all processors in the network. We consider the standard model of distributed computing, which is a point-to-point communication network.

Reference-contexts: However, slightly shifting from this extreme model towards the more common (and more reasonable) KT 1 model, this intuition fails, as is implied by the following algorithm. Consider a "traveler" which performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal (cf. <ref> [E] </ref>) on the communication graph. Observe that by carrying the list of vertices visited so far, the traveler may avoid traversing non-tree edges (or "backward" edges) since at any point during the search the traveler knows which vertices have already been visited. <p> Lemma 5.1: If G is connected then G is connected as well. Proof: The claim holds even if one deletes the heaviest edge in every cycle of the graph. In fact, the remaining subgraph in such a case is a spanning tree of the original graph (cf. <ref> [E] </ref>). An immediate consequence of the marking process used to define G is that all short cycles are disconnected, and hence we have Lemma 5.2: The girth of G satisfies g ( G) 2 + 1. We need the following proposition.
