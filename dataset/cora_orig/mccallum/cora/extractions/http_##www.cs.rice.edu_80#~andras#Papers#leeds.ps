Abstract: Statistical, parsing, database, and other methods of bringing contextual information to bear on the recognition task are described in a uniform framework in which the central data structure mediating between the recognition and the contextual components is a segment lattice, a directed graph that contains the alternative segments and their confidence/probability ranking. Explicit measures of the value of such segment lattices and the correctness of language models are proposed, and the dominant technologies are critically evaluated.

Reference-contexts: appear in boldface. 1 Language modeling as error correc tion Laboratory systems for the recognition of written or spoken input were first demonstrated in the fifties, and as soon as the size of the permitted input exceeded a few dozen fixed templates, some sort of contextual analysis component was added <ref> (Bledsoe and Browning 1959) </ref>. From early on, speech researchers preferred stochastic models, while in optical character recognition (OCR) the dominant model was, and to a significant extent continues to be, lexicon-based.

Reference-contexts: Multistratal analysis and the presence of optional elements means that the easiest strategy is submitting the whole string (often spanning several hundred symbols from the base alphabet) for parsing, so the fundamental nonlinearity of the algorithm becomes a real issue. Although island parsing techniques <ref> (see Carroll 1983) </ref> can be used to exploit the fact that the gaps between well-recognized segments are often much shorter, the worst-case scenario is found too often for this to be a generally effective strategy.
