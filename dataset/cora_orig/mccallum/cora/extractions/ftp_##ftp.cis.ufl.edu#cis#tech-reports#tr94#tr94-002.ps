Abstract: A critical computational step in large-scale process simulation using rigorous equation-based models is the solution of a sparse linear equation system. Traditional sparse solvers based on indirect addressing are not effective on supercomputers because they do not vectorize well. By relying on vectorized dense matrix kernels, the multifrontal and frontal methods provide much better performance, as demonstrated using several examples. On problems with good initial matrix orderings the frontal method is most effective, while without a good initial ordering the multifrontal method is attractive.

Reference-contexts: The multifrontal method is a generalization of the frontal method, and was originally developed for symmetric systems. Like the frontal method, it also exploits low-level parallelism and vectorization through the use of dense matrix kernels on frontal matrices <ref> (e.g., Amestoy and Duff, 1989) </ref>. However, the frontal matrices are generally smaller and denser than in the frontal method. Furthermore the multifrontal method offers more opportunities for exploiting a higher level of parallelism than the frontal method.

Reference-contexts: The goal of multifrontal methods is to replace indirect addressing in innermost loops with dense matrix kernels such as the Level-3 BLAS <ref> (Dongarra et al., 1990) </ref>. A frontal matrix E k can be factorized with the Level-3 BLAS if g k is greater than one. The method generates a directed acyclic graph (a dag) during factorization that describes the assembly process and precedence between the frontal matrices.

Reference-contexts: However, the frontal matrices are generally smaller and denser than in the frontal method. Furthermore the multifrontal method offers more opportunities for exploiting a higher level of parallelism than the frontal method. Though this classical multifrontal approach can be applied to unsymmetric systems <ref> (Duff and Reid, 1984) </ref>, this has met with only limited success, as noted by Liu (1992) in his review of work on the symmetric problem. Recently a new unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal algorithm has been described by Davis and Duff (1993). <p> The method generates a directed acyclic graph (a dag) during factorization that describes the assembly process and precedence between the frontal matrices. This dag is referred to as the assembly dag, since it functions in a similar role as the assembly tree in the classical, symmetric-pattern multifrontal method (MA37) <ref> (Duff and Reid, 1984) </ref>. In contrast, the assembly dag for the frontal method would simply be a linear chain, although the frontal method does not make use of such a dag.

Reference-contexts: The assembly process then begins again and the method proceeds to alternate between assembly and elimination phases until the matrix factorization is complete. To implement the frontal method, we use here the code FAMP, which originated at the University of Illinois <ref> (Zitney and Stadtherr, 1993a) </ref> and was later extended at Cray Research to include the use of BLAS2 and BLAS3 dense matrix kernels, as well as an out-of-core option for solving very large-scale problems, and separate analyze-factorize, factorize, and solve options.
