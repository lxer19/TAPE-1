Abstract: Subjectivism has become the dominant philosophical foundation for Bayesian inference. Yet, in practice, most Bayesian analyses are performed with so-called "noninfor-mative" priors, that is, priors constructed by some formal rule. We review the plethora of techniques for constructing such priors, and discuss some of the practical and philosophical issues that arise when they are used. We give special emphasis to Jeffreys's rules and discuss the evolution of his point of view about the interpretation of priors, away from unique representation of ignorance toward the notion that they should be chosen by convention. We conclude that the problems raised by the research on priors chosen by formal rules are serious and may not be dismissed lightly; when sample sizes are small (relative to the number of parameters being estimated) it is dangerous to put faith in any "default" solution; but when asymptotics take over, Jeffreys's rules and their variants remain reasonable choices. We also provide an annotated bibliography. fl Robert E.

Reference-contexts: the Berger-Bernardo method yields a prior that seems reasonable when judged by the long-run sampling behavior the posterior; see Berger and Bernardo (1992b). 23 The Berger-Bernardo method has now been applied to many examples including expo-nential regression (Ye and Berger 1991) multinomial models (Berger and Bernardo 1992a), AR (1) models <ref> (Berger and Yang 1992) </ref> and the product of Normal means problem (Berger and Bernardo 1989) to name just a few.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the right Haar measure gives the best invariant decision rule in invariant decision problems <ref> (Berger 1985 section 6.6.2) </ref> Related to this is a result proved by Chang and Eaves (1968) that repeated-sampling coverage probabilities and posterior probabilities agree when the prior on the group is right Haar measure. (See Section 3.7.) The invariance arguments may be replaced by weaker relative invariance arguments that require proportionality <p> A seemingly natural choice for a prior is (; t ) / ft g 1 but this leads to an improper posterior <ref> (Berger 1985, p. 187) </ref>. In this problem application of Jeffreys's general rule, based on the marginal distribution of the data, i.e., Y i ~ N (; 2 + t 2 ), leads to a proper posterior (cf. the discussion of one-way ANOVA in Box and Tiao, 1973). <p> An example occurs in the one-dimensional Normal hierarchical model, with the prior on the second-stage parameters (; ) = 1 . This is not the prior determined by Jeffreys's general rule but it illustrates the point we wish to make. This prior leads to an improper posterior <ref> (e.g., Berger 1985 p. 187) </ref> yet, in practice, with reasonably large sample sizes and a non-negligible second-stage variance, a data-analyst who uses it together with asymptotic approximation and, perhaps, other numerical methods, will rarely run into trouble.

Reference-contexts: This is not only odd from the subjectivist point of view but is generally considered undesirable since it violates the likelihood principle, which states that two experiments that produce proportional likelihoods should produce the same inferences <ref> (Berger and Wolpert 1988) </ref>. It could be argued that the choice of design is informative and so the prior should depend on the design. Nonetheless, design dependence leads to some problems.

Reference-contexts: As long as we agree on these conventions, the particular choice is not crucial. It is clear from these passages that Jeffreys did not insist on unique representations of ignorance, so that statements such as, "According to Jeffreys's conception there is only one right distribution" <ref> (Hacking, 1976, p. 203) </ref> are inaccurate.

In all of these situations, if the group is non-compact and non-commutative, the left and right Haar measures may be distinct. <ref> (See Nachbin, 1965, for details on Haar measures.) </ref> Jeffreys's non-location prior (1) is the left Haar measure (see, e.g., Dawid, 1983; this also follows from its derivation as a volume element determined by a Riemannian metric, see, e.g., Kass, 1989).

Reference-contexts: But since P (Aj) = 1=4 for every it seems we should conclude that P (A) = 1=4. Stone called such a phenomenon a strong inconsistency. It is also an example of a super-relevant betting procedure <ref> (Robinson 1979a, 1979b) </ref> and is related to a consistency principle in Bondar (1977). To see what went wrong, let us think about the improper prior as a limit of proper priors. Let p be uniform on all strings of length p.

Reference-contexts: Jeffreys (1961) is certainly in this group, as are Box and Tiao (1973) and Zellner (1971). Others, however, such as Berger and Bernardo (1989), Berger and Yang (1992, 1993) use coverage properties to discriminate among alternative candidate prior distributions. Sometimes it is not possible to get exact agreement <ref> (see Bartholomew 1965) </ref> and instead we might seek approximate agreement. Let B ff be a one-sided posterior region with posterior probability content 1 ff. Welch and Peers (1963) showed that, under certain regularity conditions, the confidence coverage of B ff is 1 ff + O (n 1=2 ).

Reference-contexts: Hartigan (1983, Section 5.2) uses the term maximal learning prior. The reason for not performing the above optimization for finite n is that the priors turn out to have finite support <ref> (Berger, Bernardo and Mendoza 1989) </ref>. Now a technical problem arises, namely, K 1 is usually infinite. (In fact, the infinities can occur for finite n; see Hartigan's discussion of Bernardo 1979a).

They argue that it is not possible to model complete ignorance, but that it is possible to model ignorance relative to a given experiment (page 25). They suggest using a flat prior in a parameterization that makes the likelihood depend on the data only through its location. Jeffreys's prior accomplishes this, at least approximately. Kass (1990) shows that these ideas can be made more precise and can be extended. </title> <note> See section 3.3. </note>
Reference-contexts: In this problem application of Jeffreys's general rule, based on the marginal distribution of the data, i.e., Y i ~ N (; 2 + t 2 ), leads to a proper posterior <ref> (cf. the discussion of one-way ANOVA in Box and Tiao, 1973) </ref>. It does so in many other problems as well, but there are counterexamples (in which Jeffreys's general rule leads to an improper posterior) and there are as yet no simple general conditions to ensure propriety.

Reference-contexts: It turns out that strong inconsistencies and Stone's proposal for avoiding them, are closely tied to the notion of coherence developed in a series of papers by Heath, Lane and Sudderth (HLS) <ref> (Heath and Sudderth 1978, 1989, Lane and Sudderth 1983) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The import of HLS coherence is to rule out non-conglomerability in the and x margins. But we should not be sanguine just because conglomerability holds in these two margins. For one thing, HLS coherence is not always preserved under conditioning or under convex combinations <ref> (Kadane, Schervish and Seidenfeld 1986) </ref>. Furthermore, HLS coherence only guarantees protection from nonconglomerability in the and x partitions of the joint space fi fi X. There is no guarantee that other strong inconsistencies cannot occur in other margins.
