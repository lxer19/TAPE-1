Title: On Path Selection for Traffic with Bandwidth Guarantees

Abstract: Transmission of multimedia streams imposes a minimum-bandwidth requirementon the path being used to ensureend-to-end Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees. While any shortest-path algorithm can be used to select a feasible path, additional constraints that limit resource consumption and balance the network load are needed to achieve efficient resource utilization. We present a systematic evaluation of four routing algorithms that offer different tradeoffs between limiting the path hop count and balancing the network load. Our evaluation considers not only the call blocking rate but also the fairness to requests for different bandwidths, robustness to inaccurate routing information, and sensitivity to the routing information update frequency. It evaluates not only the performance of these algorithms for the sessions with bandwidth guarantees, but also their impact on the lower priority best-effort sessions. Our results show that a routing algorithm that gives preference to limiting the hop count performs better when the network load is heavy, while an algorithm that gives preference to balancing the network load performs slightly better when the network load is light. We also show that the performance of using pre-computed paths with a few discrete bandwidth requests is comparable to that of computing paths on-demand, which implies the feasibility of class-based routing. We observe that the routing information update interval can be set reasonably large to reduce routing overhead without sacrificing the overall performance, although an increased number of sessions can be misrouted.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction New network service models are being proposed to support multimedia applications. These new services, e.g., the controlled-load service by the IETF [22] and the available-bit-rate (ABR) with minimal cell rate (MCR) by ATM Forum <ref> [1] </ref>, impose a minimum-bandwidth requirement on the path being used, ensuring an end-to-end Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantee. A path is feasible if the unserved bandwidth of all links on the path is higher than the requested bandwidth.

Reference-contexts: Most simulation studies of real-time traffic use an exponential call holding time distribution, while others assumed that all incoming calls last forever [18]. Recent studies <ref> [2] </ref> show that the call holding time distribution for conversations, facsimile, and voice mail connections have a large portion of very short calls and a lognormal long-tail distribution.

We use a long-tail distribution following the model (a) 60% voice and 40% video sessions (b) 100% video sessions suggested in [2]: most of our simulations use a holding time distribution that is a mixture of two normal distributions (F 1 and F 2 ) on a logarithmic time scale with the mixing probability ff (0.25 used for video sessions and 0.4 for voice sessions in our simulation).

Reference-contexts: With precomputed paths, the path selection algorithm is executed periodically as new routing information is received. The precomputed paths are stored in the routers, and routing requests result in a simple table look up. In practice, source routing <ref> [3] </ref> often selects path on demand, while hop-by-hop routing uses precomputed paths. We will evaluate both the dimensions of static versus dynamic routing, and of on-demand routing versus using precomputed paths. <p> In [21], Wang and Crowcroft study the complexity of QoS routing with multiple QoS constraints. They propose the shortest-widest path algorithm as a way of minimizing the call blocking rate, but no performance evaluation is given. In <ref> [3] </ref>, an adaptive load-based source routing algorithm for traffic requiring bandwidth guarantees is suggested by Breslau, Estrin, and Zhang. Its performance is compared with the static minimal-hop path and the alternative path algorithms.

Reference-contexts: To select a feasible path, either Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm or the Bellman-Ford shortest-path algorithm (see <ref> [4] </ref>) can be used. For example, we can define the cost of a link i j as R i j the link residual bandwidthand the cost of a path p the mrb p . Using either shortest-path algorithm, a path with the maximum mrb can be selected.

Reference-contexts: Understanding the performance tradeoffs between these routing algorithms essential to the successful deployment of QoS in future networks. Several path selection algorithms have been proposed in the literature, including widest-shortest path <ref> [9] </ref>, shortest-widest path [21], and utilization-based path selection algorithms [15]. However, a systematic evaluation of these algorithms is missing. <p> However, these two optimality criteria sometimes conflict, for example a path with the fewest hops may contain heavily loaded links. Several path selection algorithms that put different weight on limiting hop count and on balancing the network load have been proposed in the literature. They include the widest-shortest path <ref> [9] </ref>, the shortest-widest path [21], and a utilization-based shortest path [15]. In the literature on telecommunication routing, where the network is fully connected, it has been shown [6] that dynamic alternative path routing combined with trunk reservation performs well. <p> Compared with the shortest-widest path, the dynamic-alternative path puts a upper bound (n+1) on the widest-shortest path. 3.2.2 Algorithms A widest-shortest path algorithm based on the Bellman-Ford algorithm is proposed in <ref> [9] </ref>. We can also modify Dijkstra's algorithm to find the widest-shortest paths by defining two distance functions: the hop count is the primary function and the mbr is the secondary function. When selecting the next node to mark, one selects the node with the minimal hop count. <p> The study assumes that the session holding time is infinite.

Reference-contexts: The link capacity that is not reserved by guaranteed sessions is shared among all high-bandwidth sessions following the max-min fair share principle. This sharing model is not only representative of the ATM ABR service, but under some conditions it also approximates IP networks. For example, in <ref> [11] </ref> it is shown that Round-Robin scheduling combined with window-based congestion control supports max-min fairness. We consider traffic loads that are either evenly or unevenly distributed. For evenly distributed loads, a new session selects with equal probability any pair of switches as its source and destination.

Reference-contexts: When receiving a routing information update, a node updates its database and forwards the information to all its neighbors, except the one from which the update was received.

We assume that guaranteed sessions are the only traffic class in the network.

Reference-contexts: Understanding the performance tradeoffs between these routing algorithms essential to the successful deployment of QoS in future networks. Several path selection algorithms have been proposed in the literature, including widest-shortest path [9], shortest-widest path [21], and utilization-based path selection algorithms <ref> [15] </ref>. However, a systematic evaluation of these algorithms is missing. In this paper, we consider four routing algorithms based on the following optimality criteria: minimum hop count, maximum residual bandwidth, minimum path cost based on link utilization, and a variant of the dynamic-alternative path used in telecommunication networks. <p> Our focus is on routing algorithms for guaranteed sessions. For best-effort sessions we use the results in <ref> [15] </ref>. For guaranteed sessions, we assume that before communication starts, the traffic source specifies its traffic characteristics and desired performance guarantees. The network performs routing and admission control to decide if the traffic can be admitted. <p> Several path selection algorithms that put different weight on limiting hop count and on balancing the network load have been proposed in the literature. They include the widest-shortest path [9], the shortest-widest path [21], and a utilization-based shortest path <ref> [15] </ref>. In the literature on telecommunication routing, where the network is fully connected, it has been shown [6] that dynamic alternative path routing combined with trunk reservation performs well. <p> The distance function is defined by dist (p) = k X 1 where R i j is the bandwidth available on link i j . It has been shown that this algorithm performs consistently well when routing best-effort sessions <ref> [15] </ref>. * Dynamic-alternative path: Let n be the hop count of a minimum-hop path when the network is idle. A dynamic-alternative path is a widest-shortest path with no more than n+1 hops. <p> For the purpose of comparison, we also consider exponentially distributed call holding times. In <ref> [15] </ref> we considered two types of best-effort traffic: high-bandwidth sessions and low-latency sessions. <p> For example, when the blocking rate is close to 0, the preferred routing algorithm for the guaranteed sessions will allow the best effort sessions to achieve high throughput. In our earlier study <ref> [15] </ref> on routing algorithms for best-effort traffic, we used the average throughput of all best-effort sessions as the performance index: Average throughput = P i2BE bytes (i) P i2BE time (i) : where BE is the set of all best-effort sessions. (a) Audio sessions (b) Video sessions demand 4.3 Routing Information <p> WS SW SD DA 40% video sessions 0.2388 0.1665 0.1836 0.6860 100% video sessions 0.1505 0.0604 0.0678 0.4806 cluster topology, 100% video sessions, Evenly distributed load, and path selection on demand This result is different from the result obtained for best effort traffic in <ref> [15] </ref>, where we found that the impact of the routing algorithm on performance was often significant. This difference is caused by the different sharing rules in the two traffic classes. <p> In this section, we consider two classes of traffic: guaranteed sessions and best-effort sessions. Best-effort traffic uses resources left unused by the guaranteed sessions. The routing algorithm used for best effort sessions is the shortest-distance path algorithm with the distance for a path defined as ( <ref> [15] </ref>) dist (p) = k X 1 where r i is the max-min rate of link i for a new best-effort session. generated by best-effort sessions and we assume that up to 90% of the capacity of each link can be reserved by guaranteed sessions. <p> This result is different from what we observed for best-effort traffic <ref> [15] </ref>, where the shortest-distance path algorithm has a clear performance edge over the other algorithms. The reason for this is the difference in sharing policy in the two traffic classes.

Reference-contexts: With dynamic routing, link load information is advertised periodically and a different path may be selected for a given source and destination pair at different times. For simplicity, we assume that link-state routing is used for dynamic routing <ref> [19] </ref>, although the path selection algorithms discussed below can also be implemented as distance-vector routing algorithms. Paths can either be selected on-demand or they can be pre-computed. With on-demand routing, the path selection algorithm is executed for every request.
