Abstract: We show how (now familiar) hierarchical representations of (convex) polyhedra can be used to answer various separation queries efficiently (in a number of cases, optimally). Our emphasis is i) the uniform treatment of polyhedra separation problems, ii) the use of hierarchical representations of primitive objects to provide implicit representations of composite or transformed objects, and iii) applications to natural problems in graphics and robotics. Among the specific results is an O(log jP j log jQj) algorithm for determining the separation of polyhedra P and Q (which have been individually preprocessed in at most linear time).

Reference-contexts: We continue here our earlier investigations [9,10,11] of these questions with respect to convex polytopes in two and three dimensions. One of the essential themes of our earlier work (including also [19]) has been the introduction and exploitation of hierarchical representations of polytopes in this setting. In <ref> [9] </ref> two (essentially dual) hierarchical representations for (convex) polygons and polyhedra were introduced and some of their basic properties (such as the efficient response to extremal queries) a fl Supported in part by NSF Grant Number CCR87-00917 and a Guggenheim Fellowship. y Supported in part by Natural Sciences and Engineering Research <p> A pair of points (p; q), where p 2 P and q 2 Q, is said to realize the separation of P and Q if jp qj = (P; Q). 2.2 Hierarchical representations We exploit the same hierarchical representations of polygons and polyhedra introduced in <ref> [9] </ref> and subsequently studied in [10,11]. As in our earlier papers we describe such representations as abstract data types; see [14] for details of an elegant implementation. Let P be a d-polytope with vertex set V (P ). <p> Remark. Property 2.2 restricts the "growth" of polytopes as we move up the hierarchy. It also suggests that hierarchical representations have a natural dual formulation. In fact these dual representations (called inner and outer representations) were presented in parallel in <ref> [9] </ref>. 3 Separation of preprocessed polygons 3.1 Separation of polygons and linear subspaces The results in [9] for detecting the intersection of polygons and linear subspaces (points or lines) generalize very naturally to the problem of determining their separation. <p> It also suggests that hierarchical representations have a natural dual formulation. In fact these dual representations (called inner and outer representations) were presented in parallel in <ref> [9] </ref>. 3 Separation of preprocessed polygons 3.1 Separation of polygons and linear subspaces The results in [9] for detecting the intersection of polygons and linear subspaces (points or lines) generalize very naturally to the problem of determining their separation. <p> It suffices to show how this closest pair can be updated in O (1) time per step. (Note that when r i = s i , that is intersection has been detected, we can continue stepping through the hierarchical representation of P to actually construct the intersection <ref> [9] </ref>.) Suppose (r i ; s i ) realizes (P i ; S) and assume that r i 6= s i (otherwise we are done). Let H p be the (oriented) line normal to r i s i that supports P i at r i . <p> By convexity and disjointness a non-empty intersection implies that either P occludes Q or Q occludes P . Since P " L pr and Q " L pr can be constructed in O (log jP j + log jQj) time from hierarchical representations of P and Q <ref> [9] </ref>, the entire occlusion problem can be solved in this same time. 2 Remark. Consider the cone defined by polyhedron P and point p, cone (P; p) = fqjL pq "P 6= ;g. <p> Remark. In the event that (P; S) 6= 0 and S is a point or a line it is straightforward to construct P " S within the same time bound (cf. <ref> [9] </ref>). If S is a plane this is clearly impossible. However, as we noted in section 4.2, an implicit representation of P " S (sufficient to answer other intersection queries) is readily available in this case.

Reference-contexts: Our approach is similar in spirit to the polygon/linear subspace and polygon/polygon separation algorithms of sections 3.1 and 3.2 respectively. It can also be viewed as a refinement of the (unpreprocessed) polyhedron/polyhedron separation algorithm presented in <ref> [10] </ref>. Let P 1 ; ; P r be a hierarchical representation of P and Q 1 Q s be a hierarchical representation of Q, and assume without loss of generality that r s. <p> The separation (P; Q) (and its realization) of polyhedra P and Q can be determined in O (log jP j log jQj) time from their hierarchical representations. Remark. The complexity bound in Theorem 4.2 is comparable to that achieved for detecting polyhedron/polyhedron intersections in <ref> [10] </ref>. However, the earlier algorithms used a rather cumbersome representation of polyhedra that requires O (jP j 2 ) space (and preprocessing time).
