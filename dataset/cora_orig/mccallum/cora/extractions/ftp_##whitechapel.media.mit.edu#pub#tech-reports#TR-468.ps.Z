Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 468 To Appear: Proc. of the Intl. Symposium on Wearable Computers, 1998 Abstract StartleCam is a wearable video camera, computer, and sensing system, which enables the camera to be controlled via both conscious and preconscious events involving the wearer. Traditionally, a wearer consciously hits record on the video camera, or runs a computer script to trigger the camera according to some pre-specified frequency. The system described here offers an additional option: images are saved by the system when it detects certain events of supposed interest to the wearer. The implementation described here aims to capture events that are likely to get the user's attention and to be remembered. Attention and memory are highly correlated with what psychologists call arousal level, and the latter is often signaled by skin conductivity changes; consequently, StartleCam monitors the wearer's skin conductivity. StartleCam looks for patterns indicative of a "startle response" in the skin conductivity signal. When this response is detected, a buffer of digital images, recently captured by the wearer's digital camera, is downloaded and optionally transmitted wirelessly to a webserver. This selective storage of digital images creates a "flashbulb" memory archive for the wearable which aims to mimic the wearer's own selective memory response. Using a startle detection filter, the StartleCam system has been demonstrated to work on several wearers in both indoor and outdoor ambulatory environments.

Reference-contexts: By saving images when the startle response is detected, the StartleCam application models the wearer's own capacity for selective memory, according to a theory that memories are formed when survival is threatened [Dam94]. This effect is what is responsible for the the so-called "flashbulb memory <ref> [BK77] </ref>" where extremely arousing events seem to be highlighted and stored with unusual clarity. StartleCam offers three different modes of operation, direct control, automatic logging, and image series capture. <p> StartleCam's cybernetic control loop allows the wearer to control applications on the wearable computer with minimal effort. This allows the wearer to o*oad tasks for which computers are well suited. For example, human memory tends to be inaccurate for recalling the exact details of events <ref> [BK77] </ref>, and memories tend to change over time, but a computer can easily store a video archive with time stamps to aid recall.

Reference-contexts: This control loop might also be considered "cyborgian" as the term cyborg denotes man in quasi-symbiotic union with electro-mechanical homeostatic control systems. The concept of a cyborg was originally envisioned for astronauts to be able to regulate their homeostatic environment without conscious attention in the hostile environment of space <ref> [Cly95] </ref>. However, the idea is equally relevant to people on earth attempting to regulate their homeostasis against the stress created by information overload. By using physiological cues, the wearer's computer can react and respond in real time to unexpected events.

Reference-contexts: The startle response has been linked to reactions of sudden fright [LeD94], anticipation of bad results <ref> [Dam94] </ref>, and stressful situations [Hel78] [Lev92] that are deviations from homeostasis [LG88]. It is also often referred to as the orienting response, because any interruption in attention can generate it, not jut the extreme startle reaction. <p> By saving images when the startle response is detected, the StartleCam application models the wearer's own capacity for selective memory, according to a theory that memories are formed when survival is threatened <ref> [Dam94] </ref>.

StartleCam offers three different modes of operation, direct control, automatic logging, and image series capture. <p> The magnitude of the response is related to the magnitude of the stimulus. Stronger stimuli give stronger responses [SF90]. Responses can be triggered by events including turning on a light, hearing a sound or anticipating a loss in a card game <ref> [Dam94] </ref>. However, these responses will be smaller than those caused when the wearer's survival is threatened.

The StartleCam system could also be triggered by physiological measurements other than the skin conductivity response. With the same system shown in Figure 1, the wearer's heart rate, respiration rate and muscle activity can be monitored as well.

Reference-contexts: By recognizing user stress level and applying user preferences, the computer can help the wearer manage information at a level that is optimal for performance where the wearer is neither bored nor over stimulated <ref> [Kah73] </ref>. If the wearer were willing to share his responses, the data from StartleCam could be used to aid the designers of computers, cars, roads and household products. The skin conductance response is correlated with arousal, attention and effort.

In this system, the digital camera captures an image once every second and stores those images in a rotating buffer of five images.

In the opposite mode, the camera can be set to automatically record images at a set frequency when very few responses have been detected from the wearer, indicating that their attention level has dropped.

We evaluated the startle detection algorithm on these measurements, to see if the startle response could be detected as easily from the foot as from the hand. An example of the startle detection algorithm working on simultaneous data from the foot and the hand is shown in Figure 7.

Ionic sweat is more conductive than dry skin, which causes an increase in bulk conductivity, proportional to the amount the glands have filled [Llo59]. <p> The typical startle response has three components, as shown, a period of latency following the stimulus (approximately one to three seconds in duration), a rising arm, and a decay. The magnitude of the response is related to the magnitude of the stimulus. Stronger stimuli give stronger responses <ref> [SF90] </ref>. Responses can be triggered by events including turning on a light, hearing a sound or anticipating a loss in a card game [Dam94]. However, these responses will be smaller than those caused when the wearer's survival is threatened. <p> Even for stimuli which are supposed to be universally startling, such as white noise bursts, some subjects will show a strong response and others will habituate rapidly, not responding when the stimulus is repeated <ref> [SF90] </ref>. Examples of these reactions to the same stimulus are shown in Figure 3. The same subject may show either reaction on variables which are not fully un different rates for different subjects. <p> Figure (b) shows, a subject with rapid habituation, only the first stimulus elicits a response. derstood, but which may depend on the time of day and their stress level. It may also happen that a wearer exhibits a startle response when there is no apparent stimulus <ref> [SF90] </ref>. Although the frequency of unstimulated responses may be an indicator of overall stress level in the wearer, they are not indicators of particularly noteworthy events. This would cause the StartleCam system to fail with a false negative result even when the detection algorithm works perfectly. <p> The filter was chosen to match the rising arm of the startle response, as shown in Figure 2. In psy-chophysiological studies, the rising arm of the response has proved to be both more significant and less dependent on environmental variables than the decay <ref> [SF90] </ref>. This rising arm filter is shorter than one capturing the entire response and reduces the calculations required for convolution sum in the detection algorithm. Using this filter also improves detection when the decay of the response is corrupted by a second startle. <p> Other researchers in our group are currently exploring skin conductance readings taken from the large area of the back in electrodes embedded into a shirt worn by a conductor of a symphony [MP98].
