Title: APPROXIMATION IN L p (R d FROM SPACES SPANNED BY THE PERTURBED INTEGER TRANSLATES OF
Author: Michael J. Johnson 
Abstract: May 14, 1995 Abstract. The problem of approximating smooth L p -functions from spaces spanned by the integer translates of a radially symmetric function is very well understood. In case the points of translation, ffi, are scattered throughout R d , the approximation problem is only well understood in the "stationary" setting. In this work, we treat the "non-stationary" setting under the assumption that ffi is a small perturbation of Z d . Our results, which are similar in many respects to the known results for the case ffi = Z d , apply specifically to the examples of the Gauss kernel and the Generalized Multiquadric.

Reference-contexts: Jackson and Buhmann made the simplifying assumption ffi = Z d in their initial investigations (cf. [Ja], [Bu1], [Bu2]). These initial investigations were followed by others working also under the assumption ffi = Z d (namely, [DJLR], [BuD], [BR], <ref> [BeL] </ref>, [BDR], [R], [Jo1], [Jo2]) until the simplified problem was very well understood. In order to describe these results, we need a few more definitions. <p> Thus, for practical reasons, it is desirable to know, for a given fl, the slowest decaying which still yields L p -approximation of order fl. For the example of the Gauss kernel, Beatson and Light <ref> [BeL] </ref> have shown that if lim (h) 2 log (1=h) = fl then the non-stationary ladder (S h ( h ; Z d )) h almost provides L 1 -approximation of order fl (their error looks like h fl times some power of jlog hj).

Reference-contexts: We will show, as an application of Theorem 3.1, that the stationary ladder (S h (; ffi)) h provides L p -approximation of order fl for all 1 p 1 whenever ffi is a sufficiently small perturbation of Z d . According to <ref> [GS] </ref>, b can be identified on R d n0 with const (d; fl) jj fl . So, in terms of Theorem 3.1, is constant, = d, and m = dfle. It is now trivial to verify that conditions (i)-(v) are satisfied (with fl 0 := fl, * fl d). <p> For this we note that according to <ref> [GS] </ref>, b can be identified on R d n0 with b jj K fl 0 =2 (jj), where K is the modified Bessel function of order - (see [AS]) and b = b (d; fl 0 ) is some positive constant.
