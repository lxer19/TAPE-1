Abstract: Our overall goal is to characterize and understand the dynamic behavior of information economies: very large open economies of automated information agents that are likely to come into existence on the Internet. Here we model a simple information-filtering economy in which broker agents sell selected articles to a subscribed set of consumers. Analysis and simulation of this model reveal the existence of both desirable and undesirable phenomena, and give some insight into their nature and the conditions under which they occur. In particular, efficient self-organization of the broker population into specialized niches can occur when communication and processing costs are neither too high nor too low, but endless price wars can undermine this desirable state of affairs.

Reference-contexts: Simulations reveal that slightly less favored categories tend to be available much less often than the consumer population would like. Consequently, the total consumer utility is often reduced during a price war, despite the low prices <ref> [6] </ref>. Intuitively, any sort of economy consisting of myoptimal agents is likely to be plagued with price-war limit cycles. Geometrically, this behavior can be traced to the multi-peaked, discontinuous topology of the profit landscape, which in turn arises from the consumers' preference for the cheapest brokers.

Reference-contexts: For example, when is a uniform distribution, P fl is the solution to a cubic equation involving P C , P T , and V . Now suppose that the number of categories J offered by the broker is arbitrary <ref> [10] </ref>. Assuming that the category prevalences are all equal (ff j = 1=J) and the distribution of consumer interests within a given category is given by , one can derive analytic expressions for the monopolistic equilibrium price as a function of the number of categories. <p> Such a system can accommodate each broker's wish to be a monopolist in a single category. If all categories are preferred equally by the users, each broker will ultimately specialize in a single unique category (even when J fl is somewhat more than 1) <ref> [10] </ref>. However, if the consumer population slightly favors one category, a system of niche monopolists is unstable, because each broker will cut its price in an effort to own the favored category.

Reference-contexts: The assumption of myoptimality is unrealistic in several respects, and the fact that price wars occur relatively infrequently in human economies offers some hope. The economics literature describes several possible mitigating effects that may explain why price wars are less than pervasive in human economies <ref> [15] </ref>. Expressed in terms of our model, these include explicit collusion among brokers, or tacit collusion | using foresight to avoid triggering price wars. <p> Second, competition among multiple brokers encourages them to become monopolists in largely non-overlapping sets of one or a few categories. Niche specialization is typically desirable from the perspective of both the brokers and the consumers. Standard models of price wars <ref> [15] </ref> typically lead to a stable point at which no one makes a profit. The news filtering economy is extremely prone to unstable limit-cycle price wars, behavior that can be traced to the multi-humped, discontinuous topography of the profit landscape.
