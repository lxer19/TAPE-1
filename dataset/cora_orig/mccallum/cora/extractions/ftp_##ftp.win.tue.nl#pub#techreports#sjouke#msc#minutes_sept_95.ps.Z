Abstract-found: 0
Intro-found: 0
Reference: 10. <institution> It was recognized that the parallel operator in HMSC has no branches and therefore a specific syntax for placing the conditions will have to be designed. </institution>

Reference: 1. <institution> HMSCs will also need gates (as they may be embedded in simple MSCs); </institution>
Reference: 2. <institution> There should be found a way to define the connections between internal gates (gates on constituent MSC references) and external gates (on the HMSC itself) based on gate names (and not arcs). </institution>
Reference: 3. <institution> Shorthands should be deviced such that explicit connection are not always necessary in HMSCs. </institution>
Reference: 4. <institution> Such shorthands will also be considered for gates in simple MSCs. </institution>

Reference: 1. <author> E. Rudolph: </author> <title> The (old) Siemens notation suggested earlier and depicted in TD20 based on vertical lines showing the ordering. </title>

Reference: 1. <editor> Restriction on the MSC with direction were needed which separates MSC with direction from normal messages. </editor> <title> Such restrictions were: not MSC with direction on gates and no message overtaking. </title> <type> 11 </type>
