Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of accurately and automatically recovering the epipolar geometry from an uncalibrated stereo rig and its application to the image matching problem. A robust correlation based approach that eliminates outliers is developped to produce a reliable set of corresponding high curvature points. These points are used to estimate the so-called Fundamental Matrix which is closely related to the epipolar geometry of the uncalibrated stereo rig. We show that an accurate determination of this matrix is a central problem. Using a linear criterion in the estimation of this matrix is shown to yield erroneous results. Different parametrization and non-linear criteria are then devel-opped to take into account the specific constraints of the Fundamental Matrix providing more accurate results. Various experimental results on real images illustates the approach.

Reference-contexts: The pixel coordinates u and v are the only information we have if the camera is not calibrated q = [su; sv; s] T = AGM, where M = <ref> [X; Y; Z; 1] </ref> T is the point in 3D space, A is a 3 fi 3 transformation matrix accounting for camera sampling and optical characteristics and G is a 3 fi 4 displacement matrix accounting for camera position and orientation. <p> It should be pointed out that this method allows us to recover a corner position up to a pixel precision. In order to recover the corner position up to a sub-pixel position, one use the model based approach we have already developed and presented in <ref> [1] </ref>, where corners are extracted directly from the image by searching the parameters of the parametric model that best approximate the observed grey level image intensities around the corner position detected. <p> Given n point correspondences and their retinal image coordinates ~ m 1i = [u 1i ; v 1i ] T ; ~ m 2i = [u 2i ; v 2i ] T and denoting the homogeneous coordinates of ~ x = [x; y; ] T by x, i.e., x = <ref> [x; y; ; 1] </ref> T , a Monte Carlo type technique is used to draw m random subsamples of p = 8 different point correspondences. For each subsample, indexed by J , we determine the fundamental matrix F J .

Reference-contexts: The corner detector developped in <ref> [2] </ref>, is used with a value of k equal to 0.04 for providing discrimination against high contrast pixel step edges. After that, the operator output is thresholded for the corner detection.

Reference-contexts: It can be shown that the fundamental matrix F is related to the essential matrix [5] E = t fi R by F = A 1T EA 1 . Unlike the essential matrix, which is characterized by the two constraints described by Huang and Faugeras <ref> [3] </ref> which are the nullity of the determinant and the equality of the two non-zero singular values, the only property of the fundamental matrix is that it is of rank two.

The M-estimators can be implemented as a weighted least-squares problem. This method <ref> [8, 6] </ref> reveals to be robust to outliers due to bad locations.

Reference-contexts: A detailed study of these points has been made in the technical report <ref> [7] </ref>. As it has been said, one of the drawbacks of the linear criterion method is that we do not take into account the fact that the rank of F is only two, and that F thus depends on only 7 parameters. <p> It can be shown that F can also be expressed as function of the affine coordinates (x; y) and (x 0 ; y 0 ) of the two epipoles, and the coefficients, of the homog-raphy between the two pencils of epipolar lines <ref> [7] </ref> 4.2 Minimizing the distance to epipolar lines We now introduce a first non-linear approach. The idea is to use a non-linear criterion, minimizing P i ; Fq i ).

Let r i be the residual of the i-th datum, i.e., the difference between the i-th observation and its fitted value. <p> It must be solved by a search in the space of possible estimates generated from the data. Since this space is too large, only a randomly chosen subset of data can be analyzed. The algorithm which we have implemented for robustly estimating the fundamental matrix follows that structured in <ref> [9, Chap. 5] </ref>, as outlined below. <p> In our implementation, we assume " = 40% and require P = 0:99, thus m = 272. As noted in <ref> [9] </ref>, the LMedS efficiency is poor in the presence of Gaussian noise. The efficiency of a method is defined as the ratio between the lowest achievable variance for the estimated parameters and the actual variance provided by the given method. <p> To compensate for this deficiency, we further carry out a weighted least-squares procedure. The robust standard deviation estimate is given by ^ = 1:4826 [1+5=(np)] p M J ; where M J is the minimal median.
