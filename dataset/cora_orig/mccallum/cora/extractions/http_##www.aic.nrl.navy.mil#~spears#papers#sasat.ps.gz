Title: Simulated Annealing for Hard Satisfiability Problems

Abstract: Satisfiability (SAT) refers to the task of finding a truth assignment that makes an arbitrary boolean expression true. This paper compares a simulated annealing algorithm (SASAT) with GSAT (Selman et al., 1992), a greedy algorithm for solving satisfiability problems. GSAT can solve problem instances that are extremely difficult for traditional satisfiability algorithms. Results suggest that SASAT scales up better as the number of variables increases, solving at least as many hard SAT problems with less effort. The paper then presents an ablation study that helps to explain the relative advantage of SASAT over GSAT. Finally, an improvement to the basic SASAT algorithm is examined, based on a random walk suggested by Selman et al. (1993).

Reference-contexts: Fortunately, classes of problems that are difficult for traditional satisfiability algorithms have already been identified. In this paper we will concentrate on one such class, a fixed clause-length model referred to as Random L-SAT <ref> (Mitchell et al., 1992) </ref>. The performance of GSAT on Random L-SAT problems has already been reported in Selman et al. (1992). Although we could not obtain the specific problems used in their experiments, we generated random problems using their random problem generator.

Reference-contexts: Recently, GSAT has been enhanced by a feature referred to as a random walk <ref> (Selman et al., 1993) </ref>. The purpose of the walk is to allow GSAT to escape from local optima by making backwards moves. However, the random walk moves are more specific than those made by SASAT.

Reference-contexts: When the temperature is high the moves are almost random, and when the temperature is low SASAT is similar to GSAT. The annealing schedule is calculated using: temperature = MAX_TEMP * e -j * decay_rate We used our experience with the neural network algorithm <ref> (Spears, 1993) </ref> to roughly estimate the temperature parameters. We set MAX_TEMP to 0.3, MIN_TEMP to 0.01, and the decay rate to be: decay_rate = i * V where V is the number of variables and i is a loop variable in the SASAT algorithm.
