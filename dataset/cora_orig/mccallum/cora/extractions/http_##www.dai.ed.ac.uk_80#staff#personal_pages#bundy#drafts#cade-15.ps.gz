Title: The Termination of Rippling Unblocking  
Author: Alan Bundy 
Address: Edinburgh.  
Affiliation: Department of Artificial Intelligence, University of  
Abstract: Rippling is a heuristic technique for guiding rewriting of a goal with respect to one or more givens. Rewriting is restricted so that the similarities between goal and given are preserved and the movement of differences is directed and terminating. Unblocking is a technique for changing the differences to enable a subsequent ripple. The standard definition of rippling currently prevents certain, otherwise desirable, unblocking steps. In particular, some desirable unblocking steps increase the well-founded measure on which the termination proof of rippling is based. We propose an alternative family of well-founded measures under which the combination of rippling and unblocking is terminating. These new measures extend the power of rippling.

A summary of part of this theory can be found below in appendix A. Rippling can be implemented by annotating the rewrite rules so that they are also skeleton preserving and measure decreasing from left to right. Such annotated rewrite rules are called wave-rules. <p> ) ) + b The compound wave-front c + (d + : : :) is here merged into one, but can alternatively be split into two nested wave-fronts: ( c + ( d + a ) ) + b For several good reasons the theoretical account of rippling given in <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref> defines well annotated terms (wats) as being in a maximally split form, in which precisely one function symbol intervenes between wave-front and wave-hole. These reasons are: 1. It simplifies the application of wave-rules to goals. <p> It removes any ambiguity about how to calculate the wave measure. Some normal form is required for calculating the weight that each wave-front contributes to the measure. The maximally split form has the advantage of simplifying the calculation; each wave-front has a weight of 1. This gives what <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref> call the width measure. 3. It makes the theory easier. Various definitions and theorems are slightly simpler in maximally split form. For instance, the difference unification algorithm which inserts wave annotation most naturally returns wats in this form, [Basin & Walsh, 1993]. <p> In order to calculate red we need to merge all the similarly oriented wave-fronts at each point in the skeleton. This requires us to put well annotated terms in maximally merged normal form, rather than the maximally split normal form adopted in <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref>. red is then calculated for the whole wave-front. In this way the number of wave-fronts at a skeleton node does not automatically take precedence over the reduction weight of those wave-fronts, which is the problem with the width measure. <p> Note that there are often lots of wave-rules corresponding to each rewrite rule, but it is not necessary to prestore them all; wave-rules can be annotated dynamically, by need, as proposed in <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref>[x6.1]. Our proposed measure is similar, in spirit, to the proposal in [Basin & Walsh, 1996][x7.1] to lexicographically combine a size measure with a reduction order. <p> Note that there are often lots of wave-rules corresponding to each rewrite rule, but it is not necessary to prestore them all; wave-rules can be annotated dynamically, by need, as proposed in <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref>[x6.1]. Our proposed measure is similar, in spirit, to the proposal in [Basin & Walsh, 1996][x7.1] to lexicographically combine a size measure with a reduction order.

Our measure is simpler than this proposal and subsumes it, since the lexicographic combination of a size and reduction order is itself a reduction order. So our new measure can also handle the example in [Basin & Walsh, 1996][x7.1]. The size measure is not developed theoretically in [Basin & Walsh, 1996]. For instance, note that, like our measure, it requires a definition of wat which permits maximally merged form. This paper provides that theoretical development. <p> Our measure is simpler than this proposal and subsumes it, since the lexicographic combination of a size and reduction order is itself a reduction order.

For instance, note that, like our measure, it requires a definition of wat which permits maximally merged form. This paper provides that theoretical development. Our measure also subsumes the width measure, by defining red to count the number of nested wave-fronts. <p> This would allow nested rippling to any depth. 6 The Definition of Well Annotated Term The formal definition of this new wave measure requires a major overhaul of the theory of rippling given in <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref> or appendix A. We start this with the definition of well annotated term. This was previously defined to be in maximally split normal form. We need a redefinition in which both maximally split and maximally merged normal forms are included. <p> So we also need normalisation procedures for switching between the two normal forms. Below is such an inclusive redefinition of wats. It will be convenient for this theoretical development to follow <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref> by replacing the grey box notation with the meta-functions: wf =2, wh=1 and snk=2, which denote wave-fronts, wave-holes and sinks 4 , respectively 5 . <p> follow <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref> by replacing the grey box notation with the meta-functions: wf =2, wh=1 and snk=2, which denote wave-fronts, wave-holes and sinks 4 , respectively 5 . For instance, s ( x) " +byc is represented as wf (s (wh (x)); out)+snk (y; Y ), 4 Actually, [Basin & Walsh, 1996] does not deal with sinks; their inclusion is a further innovation of this paper. 5 This is essentially how wave annotation is implemented in Clam. 8 Alan Bundy where the second argument of wf denotes the direction and the second argument of snk denotes the free variable <p> The properties of monotonicity and stability ensure that the goals they rewrite are also measure decreasing. The proofs of these two properties are essentially the same as those given for the standard wave measure order in <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref>. We do not repeat those proofs here but merely remark on any changes required to them 6 . Both proofs require a multi-part supplementary lemma about splicing together lists of numbers. The well-ordered sets returned by wom and wim are lists of numbers. <p> For the condition we will need a pairwise multi-set subset relation d . The lemma also uses the lexicographic order on lists, &lt; l , defined in appendix A. Lemma 1 (Supplementary Lemma:) This three part lemma is adapted from lemma 4 in <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref>[p168]. Let l and l 0 be lists of length i and l 0 &lt; l l. <p> The remaining two lemmas are unproblematic. 6 As a matter of interest, note that both the monotonicity and stability lemmas are rippling problems and that their proofs use rippling. 7 For a definition of this function see <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref>[p167-8]. 8 +=3 has been slightly modified to apply to lists numbered from 1 instead of 0. 12 Alan Bundy Lemma 2 (Monotonicity of with respect to wats:) This lemma is based on lemma 5 in [Basin & Walsh, 1996][p168-9]. m (l) m (r) ! m (s [l]) <p> proofs use rippling. 7 For a definition of this function see <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref>[p167-8]. 8 +=3 has been slightly modified to apply to lists numbered from 1 instead of 0. 12 Alan Bundy Lemma 2 (Monotonicity of with respect to wats:) This lemma is based on lemma 5 in [Basin & Walsh, 1996][p168-9]. m (l) m (r) ! m (s [l]) m (s [r]) s [r] means s [l] with the distinguished subterm l replaced by r. Proof Remarks: The proof is identical to that in [Basin & Walsh, 1996][p168-9], except for the appeal to lemma 1 part 1. <p> of with respect to wats:) This lemma is based on lemma 5 in <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref>[p168-9]. m (l) m (r) ! m (s [l]) m (s [r]) s [r] means s [l] with the distinguished subterm l replaced by r. Proof Remarks: The proof is identical to that in [Basin & Walsh, 1996][p168-9], except for the appeal to lemma 1 part 1. <p> These conditions are true by the definition of wom and wim. Lemma 3 (Stability of with respect to wats:) This lemma is based on lemma 6 in <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref>[p169-70]. m (l) m (r) ! m (s) m (r) Proof Remarks: The proof is almost identical to that in [Basin & Walsh, 1996][p168-9]. <p> Lemma 3 (Stability of with respect to wats:) This lemma is based on lemma 6 in <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref>[p169-70]. m (l) m (r) ! m (s) m (r) Proof Remarks: The proof is almost identical to that in [Basin & Walsh, 1996][p168-9]. In the simply annotated case of that proof there is an appeal to the fact that instanti-ations of a variable in a wave-front (not in a wave-hole) have no effect on the weight of that wave-front. This is not true of our measure. <p> A member of our new family of wave measures can handle the counter-examples to combined rippling and unblocking termination given in x4. We have shown rippling plus unblocking to be terminating. Our definitions and proofs generalise and realise a proposal made in <ref> [Basin & Walsh, 1996] </ref>[x7.1]. Our wave measure family includes all the wave measures proposed in [Basin & Walsh, 1996] and provides powerful new kinds of measure. <p> We have shown rippling plus unblocking to be terminating.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Rippling 1 is a heuristic technique for guiding rewriting of a goal with respect to one or more givens <ref> [Bundy et al, 1993] </ref>. Rippling and unblocking were originally developed for guiding the step cases of inductive proofs, where the given is the induction hypothesis and the goal is the induction conclusion. It has subsequently been found to be more generally useful.

The new measure can also handle the other counter-examples in x4. This new measure also permits the rippling of s ( s ( m) " " " " using wave-rule (1), as discussed in x3.

Reference-contexts: It has subsequently been found to be more generally useful. For instance, it has been applied to summing series, limit theorems and general equational reasoning, <ref> [Hutter, 1997] </ref>. Differences between the goal and given (s) are marked by meta-level annotations in the goal, called wave annotations. These annotations consist of wave-fronts, which mark differences, and contain wave-holes, which mark similarities. Sinks are parts of the goal which correspond to free variables in a given. <p> This overall measure can be well-ordered lexicographically. Unfortunately, the lexicographic combination of the width measure and a reduction measure 3 is not powerful enough to permit some common unblockings, as the next example illustrates. The following rippling problem is adapted from <ref> [Hutter, 1997] </ref>[p411]. <p> We have provided a more powerful theoretical framework for: the combination of standard reduction orders like rpo with rippling; and nested rippling towards different givens. Hutter has shown that such nested rippling is necessary for applying rippling to general equational reasoning, <ref> [Hutter, 1997] </ref>. A The Standard Theory of Rippling Rippling is a form of rewriting performed on the well-annotated terms of some underlying logic, usually use first-order predicate calculus. Let unat (unannotated terms) be the set of first-order expressions. The following definitions are adapted from [Basin & Walsh, 1996].
