Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of routing customers to identical servers, each with its own infinite capacity queue. Under the assumptions that i) the service times form a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with increasing failure rate distribution and ii) state information is not available, we establish that the round robin policy minimizes, in the sense of a separable increasing convex ordering, the customer response times and the numbers of customers in the queues.

Theorem 1 Assume the system is empty at time t = 0. Assume that service times form a sequence of i.i.d. r.v.'s with IFR distribution. <p> It follows from property (b) of Lemma 2 that P s b N i (t) i=1 i (t).
