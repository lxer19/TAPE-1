Title: Warping Similarity Space in Category Learning by BackProp Nets  
Author: Adriaan Tijsseling Stevan Harnad 
Address: Southampton  
Affiliation: Cognitive Sciences Centre Cognitive Sciences Centre University of Southampton University of  
Abstract: We report simulations with backpropagation networks trained to discriminate and then categorize a set of stimuli. The findings suggest a possible mechanism for categorical perception based on altering interstimulus similarity.

Reference-contexts: In these kinds of experiments, CP occurs when pairwise similarity judgments within and between categories have changed relative to judgments prior to category learning, with within-category compression of perceived similarity and/or between-category separation <ref> (Goldstone, 1994) </ref>.

Reference-contexts: It seems that the wavelength continuum has somehow been "warped", with some regions getting compressed and other regions getting expanded <ref> (Harnad, 1987) </ref>. In the case of color perception, this change in similarity structure appears to be a product of evolution, an inborn property of our sensory systems, and only minimally modifiable (if at all) by experience.

Reference-contexts: on the basis of the simulations with one-dimensional input patterns that a potential mechanism for CP may be based on the following factors: (i) iconicity of the internal representations, (ii) movement of internal representations to obtain linear separability, (iii) maximal inter-representational separation, and (iv) inverse-distance forces at the category boundary <ref> (see also Harnad et al. 1995) </ref>. In particular, we have stressed the iconicity of the input patterns, which is closely related to the amount of linear separability among the hidden unit representations. Iconicity constrains the networks tendency to seek maximal inter-representational separation. unit representations after auto-association linearly inseparable.

Reference-contexts: However, these conditions are not the interesting ones from a psychological point of view. In categorical perception experiments with human subjects, the stimuli are already discriminable by the subject, but the categories into which they must be sorted are confusable <ref> (see Pevtzow & Harnad, 1997, this volume) </ref>. The objective in these experiments is to see whether mastering the categorization task changes the discriminability of the stimuli.
