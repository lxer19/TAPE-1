Reference-contexts: Specifically, the routing message digital signature and sequence numbers are providing authentication and integrity services of routing messages, which compose the first class of communication described above. If these services were available from network <ref> [1, 2] </ref> or transport layer protocols, these mechanisms would no longer be needed in the routing protocols. 3 of 8 A number of data structures are defined for use in the pseudo-code for the distance-vector algorithms defined below. Sequence Number (seqNum): The sequence number maintained by each router.

Reference-contexts: Using the information about the next-to-last network (predecessor), an implicit path to a destination can be inferred and thus routing loops can be detected. Path finding algorithms thereby eliminate the well known counting-to-infinity problem of DBF <ref> [3] </ref>. Each distance and routing table entry is associated with the predecessor information.

Reference-contexts: The Domain Name System with the proposed security ex tensions <ref> [4] </ref> might meet these requirements. 3.1. Routing message protection countermeasures The following countermeasures are effectively implementing security services not available from lower level transport or network protocols.

Reference-contexts: Update messages are exchanged between neighbors to update the routing information. An update message contains the source node and the destination network identifiers, and the distance and predecessor information for one or more destinations. The working of algorithms of this type is described by Murthy and Garcia-Luna-Aceves <ref> [12, 5] </ref>. To secure distance-vector protocols we include the predecessor information defined above in each update. Using this information we then perform a path traversal for each selected route, verifying the integrity of the path and the distance reported for the route. Digitally sign updates. <p> Time per destination: Each selection of a new path to a destination requires a path-traversal. The frequency such changes is dependent on network topology and link change events. However, as has been demonstrated by Garcia-Luna-Aceves and Murthy, efficient path traversal algorithms add minimal overhead <ref> [5] </ref>. Note that all of the validation actions, which will likely account for a large share of these costs, can be done on a statistical basis to contain time costs. 4.

Reference-contexts: Note that all of the validation actions, which will likely account for a large share of these costs, can be done on a statistical basis to contain time costs. 4. Related work Kumar <ref> [6] </ref> analyzes the security requirements of network routing protocols, and discusses the general measures needed to secure the distance-vector and link-state routing protocol classes. He identifies two sources of attacks: subverted routers, and subverted links.

Reference-contexts: Perlman has defined two classes of network failures [14]. A simple failure occurs when a node or a link in a network becomes inoperative, and ceases to function at all. A Byzan-tine failure, defined in terms of the Byzantine Generals Problem <ref> [7] </ref>, occurs when nodes or links continue to operate, but incorrectly. A node with a Byzantine failure may corrupt, delay, or forge messages, or may send conflicting messages to different nodes. Possible causes of Byzantine failures include mis-configured nodes, software bugs, unusual hardware failure modes, and hostile attacks.
Reference: [8] <author> G. Malkin. </author> <note> RIP Version 2: Carrying Additoinal Information. RFC 1723, </note> <month> Nov. </month> <year> 1994. </year>
Reference-contexts: Current routing protocols contain few, if any, mechanisms to provide for the security of their operation. Those that exist are often incomplete. For example, the security mechanisms currently defined for BGP [15] and RIPv2 <ref> [8] </ref> protect the transmission of routing messages across local networks; however, they do not provide integrity or authenticity of the routing information itself as it traverses an internet. These mechanisms require trust of neighbors regarding updates describing the full internet and, transitively, similar trust of all routers in an internet.

Reference-contexts: Interpreting this description for a routing environment, we identify the following general classes of intruders: Masquerading routers: A masquerading router occurs when a node successfully forges an authorized router's identity. This can be accomplished using the IP spoof ing <ref> [9] </ref>, or source routing attacks. Subverted routers: A subverted router occurs when an authorized router is caused to violate the routing protocols, or to inappropriately claim authority for network resources.

Reference-contexts: These results are similar to ours with the exception that we explicitly assume the existence of subverted routers, and provide countermeasures to protect against them. We feel this is important as routers are potentially vulnerable to attacks from a number of sources, with potentially catastrophic results from success. Murphy <ref> [10] </ref> outlines a solution for securing distance-vector protocols that involves including the information used to select a route, signed by the neighbor it received it from, in the routing update it then signs and transmits to its neighbors.

Reference-contexts: These mechanisms require trust of neighbors regarding updates describing the full internet and, transitively, similar trust of all routers in an internet. More recent efforts are addressing both the security of routing message transmission and of the routing information itself; however, they target link-state protocols <ref> [11] </ref>. While this class of routing pro tocols has the advantage of a more straightforward means of securing routing information in a manner that effectively limits the scope of trust, it also involves considerable computation and space overhead that compromise their usability in large-scale internets.

Reference-contexts: And, usurpation is an event that results in control of system services or functions by an unauthorized entity. Security Service: Vulnerabilities and threats are minimized or eliminated through the provision of six security services <ref> [13] </ref>. Confidentiality is the protection of data so it is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes. Integrity is the protection of data so that it is not altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.

Reference-contexts: Given the evolution of the global Internet to a commercial, production network infrastructure, this state of affairs is clearly unacceptable. Perlman has defined two classes of network failures <ref> [14] </ref>. A simple failure occurs when a node or a link in a network becomes inoperative, and ceases to function at all. A Byzan-tine failure, defined in terms of the Byzantine Generals Problem [7], occurs when nodes or links continue to operate, but incorrectly.

Sec tion 5 presents our conclusions. 1 of 8 2. Vulnerabilities in distance-vector protocols The proposed Internet Security Architecture (ISA) <ref> [16] </ref> provides an architecture for the inclusion of security facilities in the design of protocols to be used in the Internet. Fundamental to the ISA are four concepts: Vulnerability: A weakness in a system's security that may be exploited by an intruder. Threat: A potential violation of security.
