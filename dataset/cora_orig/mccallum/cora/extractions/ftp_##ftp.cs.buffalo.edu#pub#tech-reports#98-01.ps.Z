Abstract: The paradox of the Unexpected Hanging, related prediction paradoxes, and the sorites paradoxes all involve reasoning about ordered collections of entities: days ordered by date in the case of the Unexpected Hanging; men ordered by the number of hairs on their heads in the case of the bald man version of the sorites. The reasoning then assigns each entity a value that depends on the previously assigned value of one of the neighboring entities. The final result is paradoxical because it conflicts with the obviously correct, commonsensical value. The paradox is due to the serial procedure of assigning a value based on the newly assigned value of the neighbor. An alternative procedure is to assign each value based only on the original values of neighbors|a parallel procedure. That procedure does not give paradoxical answers.

Reference-contexts: Determining this can be difficult. For some classes of problems, procedures can be formally derived from the formal specifications of the problem (Gries, 1981), and for some classes of problems, procedures can be formally proven to be correct <ref> (Dijkstra, 1976) </ref>. However, in most cases, the best we can do is test a procedure against problem instances for which we know the correct answers. If the procedure produces answers we know are correct, we gain some confidence that the procedure may be correct.

Reference-contexts: The second notion is whether or not a procedure is correct (or appropriate) for a particular class of problems. Determining this can be difficult. For some classes of problems, procedures can be formally derived from the formal specifications of the problem <ref> (Gries, 1981) </ref>, and for some classes of problems, procedures can be formally proven to be correct (Dijkstra, 1976). However, in most cases, the best we can do is test a procedure against problem instances for which we know the correct answers.

Reference-contexts: The fact that Hyde's answer wasn't correct is due to the fact that he used an inappropriate method of reasoning. 2 The Literature The Unexpected Hanging has been discussed in several forms in a number of papers and books starting with (O'Connor, 1948). Good discussions and bibliographies are in <ref> (Hughes and Brecht, 1978) </ref>, (Gardner, 1991), (Sainsbury, 1995), and (Chow, 1998). (Gardner, 1991) has a bibliography of 57 items dating from 1948 to 1988. A recent opinion on the paradox is that Hyde's reasoning shows the judge's sentence to be self-contradictory.

A recent opinion on the paradox is that Hyde's reasoning shows the judge's sentence to be self-contradictory. <p> Sorensen's other "recalcitrant variations" also fit the analysis presented in this present paper. 6 Sorites Paradoxes A set of paradoxes usually considered to be unrelated to the Unexpected Hanging and its cousins are the sorites, or heap, paradoxes (see <ref> (Sainsbury, 1995, pp. 23-51) </ref>). A standard example of this paradox is: A man with no hair on his head is certainly bald. If a man with 0 hairs is bald, then so is a man with 1 hair.

Reference-contexts: As above, Hyde's reasoning is correct in the sense that he correctly got the answer computed by his procedure. However, he used an inappropriate procedure for the problem. The way to see that Hyde's procedure is inappropriate is to note that it got the wrong answer. As Scriven says <ref> (Scriven, 1951, p. 403) </ref> "the monster, Reality" proves him wrong. How do we know that Hyde's answer is incorrect? That is something I do not feel I have to explain. Everyone who has ever discussed this paradox agrees that 4 Hyde's answer is wrong.

Reference-contexts: The accuracy of the judge's statement may be preserved by taking Hyde's reductio argument to contradict the appropriatness of his own reasoning procedure. The key is realizing that there are alternative reasoning procedures. 5.1 Non-linearly Ordered Versions Sorensen <ref> (Sorensen, 1982) </ref> shows that the Unexpected Hanging and similar paradoxes do not rely on a strict, linear ordering of the entities being examined. However, he does order them by groups. For example, in his "undiscoverable position paradox," the entities are the nine positions of a 3 by 3 matrix.
