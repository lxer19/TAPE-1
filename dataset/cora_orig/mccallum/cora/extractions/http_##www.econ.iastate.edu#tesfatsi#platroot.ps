Abstract: ISU Economic Report No. 39 Abstract. This paper presents a general C++ platform for the implementation of a trade network game (TNG) that combines evolutionary game play with preferential partner selection. In the TNG, successive generations of resource constrained traders choose and refuse trade partners on the basis of continually updated expected payoffs, engage in risky trades modelled as two-person games, and evolve their trade strategies over time. The modular design of the TNG platform facilitates experimentation with alternative specifications for market structure, trade partner matching, trading, expectation formation, and trade strategy evolution. The TNG platform can be used to study the evolutionary implications of these specifications at three different levels: individual trader attributes; trade network formation; and social welfare. revised September 1997

Reference-contexts: These parameter settings were chosen to match as closely as possible the "standard scenario" used as a benchmark case by Ashlock et al. <ref> [1, Table 3] </ref> for an IPD game with choice and refusal of partners. The latter authors found that rapid convergence to mutual cooperation took place for this benchmark case, and the TNG results qualitatively replicate this finding.

Reference-contexts: Exploiting the recent advent of more powerful computational tools, ACE researchers such as Duong <ref> [2] </ref>, Epstein and Axtell [3], Tesfatsion [15], and Vriend [17] have been able to extend this previous work in three key ways. First, ACE models generally consist of heterogeneous agents who determine their interactions with other agents and with their environment on the basis of internalized data and behavioral rules.

Indeed, as stressed in Epstein and Axtell <ref> [3] </ref>, such frameworks may at last provide a common paradigm for social science as a whole. 26

Reference-contexts: The modelling of evolutionary economies has of course been pursued by many previous researchers. See, for example, the numerous interesting studies surveyed by Witt [18] and Nelson [11]. In addition, as detailed in Friedman <ref> [4] </ref>, economists have recently been focusing on the potential economic applicability of evolutionary game theory in which a fixed number of strategy types reproduce in direct proportion to their relative fitness.

Reference-contexts: The determination of trade partners in the TNG is currently implemented using a modified version of the well-known Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance mechanism <ref> [5] </ref>. This modified mechanism, hereafter referred to as the deferred choice and refusal (DCR) mechanism, presumes that each buyer and seller currently associates an expected payoff with each potential trade partner.

Reference-contexts: Nevertheless, tractability issues have generally forced the use of relatively simple types of models which either directly posit aggregate behavioral relations or impose strong restrictions on the potential variability of behavior across agents; see Kirman <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The following discussion emphasizes the particular features of this framework that have been used to implement the TNG. SimBioSys is designed to handle simulations comprising the following four features: 3 C++ is a popular object-oriented extension of the C programming language; see, for example, Lipp man <ref> [9] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: This TNG platform is supported by SimBioSys, a general class framework for evolutionary simulations developed by McFadzean <ref> [10] </ref> that has a number of capabilities important for ACE modelling. In particular, the TNG platform permits traders to be instantiated as autonomous en-dogenously interacting software agents (tradebots) with internal behavioral functions and with internally stored information that includes identifiers for other tradebots. <p> Concluding remarks are given in Section 6. 2 SimBioSys: An Evolutionary Simulation Framework SimBioSys is a general C++ framework 3 for evolutionary simulations developed by Mc-Fadzean <ref> [10] </ref>. The framework permits a user to construct a virtual spatial environment inhabited by any number of evolving populations of autonomous agents. The following discussion emphasizes the particular features of this framework that have been used to implement the TNG. <p> These evolved phenotypes are then assigned to a new generation of agents, a new breeding cycle commences, and the whole process repeats. Various artificial life applications of SimBioSys are reported in McFadzean <ref> [10, Chapter 6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An employer fires one of its current workers by refusing future work offers from this worker, and a worker quits his current employer by ceasing to direct work offers to this employer. This TNG special case thus extends the standard treatment of labor markets as assignment problems <ref> [12] </ref> by incorporating subsequent strategic (efficiency wage) interactions between matched pairs of workers and employers and by having these interactions iterated over time. Case 2: Intermediation with Choice and Refusal The buyer subset B and the seller subset S overlap but do not coincide. <p> A trader that neither submits nor accepts trade offers during this matching process receives a wallflower payoff , W . The buyer-seller matching outcomes generated by the DCR mechanism exhibit the usual static optimality properties associated with Gale-Shapley type matching mechanisms <ref> [12] </ref>. First, any such matching outcome is core stable, in the sense that no subset of traders has an incentive to block the matching outcome by engaging in a feasible rearrangement of trade partners among themselves [15, Proposition 3.2].

Reference-contexts: Exploiting the recent advent of more powerful computational tools, ACE researchers such as Duong [2], Epstein and Axtell [3], Tesfatsion <ref> [15] </ref>, and Vriend [17] have been able to extend this previous work in three key ways. First, ACE models generally consist of heterogeneous agents who determine their interactions with other agents and with their environment on the basis of internalized data and behavioral rules. <p> These evolutionary selection pressures result in the continual creation of new modes of behavior and an ever-changing network of agent interactions. The present paper focuses on the particular ACE model developed by Tesfatsion <ref> [15] </ref> to study the endogenous formation and evolution of trade networks. This model, referred to as the trade network game (TNG), extends to an economic setting an earlier model ([1], [13]) combining evolutionary game play with endogenous partner selection. <p> The TNG platform thus facilitates the general ACE study of trade networks. The general features of SimBioSys are outlined in Section 2. The basic TNG model is outlined in Section 3, making use of the particular TNG module specifications detailed in <ref> [15] </ref>. Section 4 describes how the TNG has been implemented with the support of SimBioSys. Section 5 illustrates how the TNG implementation can be used to study evolutionary TNG outcomes at three different levels of analysis: individual trader attributes; trade network formation; and social welfare. <p> This new trader generation then enters into a new generation cycle and the whole process repeats. 5 The TNG currently uses the particular specifications for market structure, trade partner determination, trade, expectation updating, and trade behavior evolution detailed in <ref> [15] </ref>. For completeness, these specifications are reviewed below. 5 A generation cycle in the TNG corresponds to a breeding cycle in SimBioSys and a trade cycle in the TNG corresponds to an action cycle in SimBioSys. <p> First, any such matching outcome is core stable, in the sense that no subset of traders has an incentive to block the matching outcome by engaging in a feasible rearrangement of trade partners among themselves <ref> [15, Proposition 3.2] </ref>. Second, define a matching outcome to be B-optimal if it is core stable and if each buyer matched under the matching outcome is at least as well off as he would be under any other core stable matching outcome. <p> 11 Player 2 c d Player 1 d (H,L) (D,D) Table 3: Payoff Matrix for the Prisoner's Dilemma Game each TNG trade cycle, the DCR mechanism yields the unique B-optimal matching outcome as long as each trader has a strict preference order over the potential trade partners he finds tolerable <ref> [15, Proposition 3.3] </ref>. Trades are currently modelled in the TNG as prisoner's dilemma (PD) games. For example, a trade may involve the exchange of a good or service of a certain promised quality in return for a loan or wage contract entailing various payment obligations. <p> After a finite number of offer rounds, 10 a point is reached where buyers make no further trade offers to sellers.
