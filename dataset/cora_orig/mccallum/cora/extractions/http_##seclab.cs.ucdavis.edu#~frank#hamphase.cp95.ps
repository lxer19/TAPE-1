Abstract: Problem instances of many N P-Hard problems can be characterized by a parameter which describes how constrained the problem instance is. Based on this parameter instances can be partitioned into two natural classes: those which are mostly solvable and those which are mostly unsolvable. If classes are examined against a "constrainedness" axis, the transition from mostly solvable to mostly unsolvable occurs rapidly, and is called a phase transitions. Problem instances near this phase transition take more time, on the average, to solve using backtracking algorithms. We present empirical results on the location of the phase transition for Hamiltonian cycle, complementing earlier theoretical results by Posa. We relate these results to the phase transition for graph connectivity proved by Erdos and Renyi, and empirical results on the phase transition for graph bi-connectivity. In particular, we present evidence that if a graph is biconnected then there is a high probability that it is also Hamiltonian. We use the phase transitions for easy graph problems to illuminate the phase for an N P-Hard graph problem. Finally, we use these results to analyze the effectiveness of a fast probabilistic polynomial-time algorithm to find Hamil-tonian cycles by Angluin and Valiant. We summarize with a set of strategies for solving Hamiltonian Cycle problems for differ ently constrained graphs.

Reference-contexts: Some of this research concerns the use of phase transitions. Results on phase transitions attack several interesting questions about N P-Hard problems. Phase transitions have proven to be a good location for problem instances which are hard on the average for complete search algorithms to solve <ref> [ CKT91 ] </ref> .

Much of this research has helped shed light on the phenomena in computer science. <p> Measuring the average amount of time (or an equivalent complexity measurement such as number of states) required to solve many instances at different values of the constraint parameter provides evidence that the maximum average complexity is achieved at or near the phase transition. <ref> [ CKT91 ] </ref> presented empirical results showing this relationship for Hamiltonian Cycle, Travelling Salesman, 3-SAT, and Graph Coloring. <p> While their result applies to both directed and undirected graphs, we restrict our discussion in this paper to undirected graphs only.

This data is shown in figure 4. We see results Cycle. similar to those reported in <ref> [ SK95 ] </ref> ; the complexity peaks become narrower and narrower. We also notice that the maximum moves to the right with N ; that is, for larger N the maximum cost occurs at a larger and larger value of E N log N . <p> Since there are some problems which Angluin and Valiant has difficulty solving, even after repeated independent executions, using information from the previous runs might improve future runs. We think an approach similar to clause weights or using histories as in <ref> [ SK95 ] </ref> might be appropriate. Another heuristic con centrates on avoiding "collisions", in which the node selected to extend the path is already on the path. Since a collision involves re-writing part of the path, it takes work.
