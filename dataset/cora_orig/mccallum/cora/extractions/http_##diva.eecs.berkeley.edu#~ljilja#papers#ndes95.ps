Abstract: We address the calculation of dc operating points of nonlinear circuits by using parameter embedding methods (also known as continuation and homotopy methods), and we show that the usefulness of these methods depends on the type of a circuit's descriptive equations. We implemented homotopy algorithms in the industrial circuit simulator TITAN. We demonstrated that homotopy methods can be used as an alternative to the Newton-Raphson-type solvers and that they can be successfully applied to solving nonlinear circuit equations as well as to calculating dc operating points of nonlinear transistor circuits.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper we address the calculation of dc operating points of nonlinear circuits by means of parameter embedding methods (also known as continuation and homotopy methods). One of the first implementations of continuation methods in an industrial circuit simulator was by Cermak in 1971 <ref> [1] </ref>. Other implementations followed [2]-[6]. Continuation and homotopy methods have been rediscovered several times in circuit theory (see [5] and [7] for extensive reference lists). Nevertheless, information about implementations of homotopy methods in industrial circuit simulators is not readily available in the literature with the exception of [3]-[6].

Reference-contexts: We show that the so-called "standard embedding" F (x; ) := (1 )x + f (x) = 0 (4) fails if we use the well-known Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA) equations <ref> [11] </ref>. The MNA method is used today in most SPICE-like circuit simulators [12]. The main reason for choosing the MNA approach when writing circuits' equations is to include network elements that are not current sources or do not have an admittance representation (such as certain controlled sources).

Reference-contexts: Therefore, in contrast to the basic nodal equations, not all MNA equations represent sums of currents. Some of these equations describe the inter-connection of network elements. Consider the simple circuit shown in Figure 1 (a). The MNA equations of this circuit (see e.g., <ref> [13] </ref>) are: 1 0 u 1 U 0 : (5) In order to apply the homotopy approach, we define the following function: f (x) := G 1 U 0 ; (6) where x = i 0 .

Reference-contexts: This is in contrast to the behavior of nodal equations, where similar embedding always leads to circuits with non-negative resistances <ref> [14] </ref>. In conclusion, the embedding of a parameter should be done in a manner that avoids non-physical network instances (e.g., occurrence of negative resistors).
