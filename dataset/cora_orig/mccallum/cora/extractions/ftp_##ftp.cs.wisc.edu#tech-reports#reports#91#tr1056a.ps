Reference-contexts: One advantage of (4) over the original problem (1) is the induced symmetry of the quadratic term which permits the potential use of successive overrelaxation (SOR) methods such as those of <ref> [4] </ref> especially for the monotone linear complementarity problem, that is when X is the nonnegative orthant. 4 In addition, (4) is strongly convex when fl &gt; 0.

Reference-contexts: y (x) as defined by (3) simplifies to y (x) 2 arg min (y x) T (M y + q) + 2 2 We now derive a strong upper semicontinuity result for the nondegenerate monotone affine variational inequality problem based on a similar result for the monotone linear complementarity problem <ref> [6] </ref>. Theorem 7 (Strong upper semicontinuity of nondegenerate monotone affine variational inequalities) Let M be positive semidefinite and let (1) be solvable with ^x being some nondegenerate solution of (1), that is ^x and a corresponding ^u solve (13) and such that (31) holds. <p> T u i + q 0; u i 0 (33) Then for sufficiently large i, y i 2 X, where (y i ; u i ) solve min n fi fi M y A T u + q 0; Ay b; y; u 0 (34) Proof By Corollary 14 of <ref> [6] </ref>, there exists an i, such that for all i i arg min n fi fi M y A T u + q 0; Ay b; y; u 0 SOL (N; p) where SOL (N; p) is the solution set of (13).

Reference-contexts: Proof Note first that (15) has a solution. This is trivial under assumption (i), by strong convexity and X 6= ;. For the case when fl = 0, this follows from the facts that X is nonempty and the dual quadratic program <ref> [8] </ref>, given by max n fi fi (M + M T )y M T x A T u + q 0; u 0 (19) is feasible and hence the convex quadratic objective of (15) is bounded from below. <p> That the dual problem (19) is feasible follows from assumption (ii) by taking y = x in (19), or 10 from assumption (iii) since this implies (M + M T )r = 0; Ar 0; 0 6= r 0 has no solution r and hence by Tucker's Theorem <ref> [8, Theorem 2.4.3] </ref> there exist (y; u) such that (M + M T )y A T u &gt; 0; u 0 By multiplying this (y; u) by sufficiently large &gt; 0 it follows that (M + M T )y M x A T u + q &gt; 0; u 0 and <p> It now follows from duality <ref> [8, Theorem 8.2.4] </ref> that if y (x) is a solution of the convex quadratic program (15), then y (x) and some u (x) must also solve the dual quadratic program maximize y;u 2 ky xk fly T (y x) q T x + b T u subject to (M + M

Reference-contexts: We now show Y Z. It is easy to see that x 2 Z and so it follows from the characteri zation of the solution set of a convex quadratic program given in <ref> [9, Corollary 1] </ref> that Z = x 2 X fi o The inclusion Y Z is now obvious. To establish the last conclusions of the lemma, let x 2 Z.

Reference-contexts: We shall assume that the solution set of (5), SOL (N; p), is nonempty. By slight modification of the proofs of Lemma 2.5 and Theorem 2.7 of [13] and making use of Theorem 2.6 of <ref> [10] </ref> we obtain the following simplified error bounds in terms of another "natural" residual s (z) (see (8) below). <p> 9 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ; If the LCP (5) has some nondegenerate solution ^z; that is ^z + N ^z + p &gt; 0; then the bound (7) simplifies to <ref> [10, Theorem 2.6] </ref> kz z (z)k (N; p)s (z); (12) with the term -(N; p) deleted from (9), and the terms ^ N 1 1 2 deleted from (11).

Reference-contexts: See also [16] for results concerning the nonlinear case, where a strongly monotone Lipschitz continuous function f replaces the affine function M x + q in (1) and [12] for other related error bounds. In <ref> [11] </ref>, global error bounds were also given for the case of positive semidefinite M in terms of a gradient projection residual multiplied by a term that involves the norm of the point x. <p> This is so if and only if x and some u satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions (13) for the linear program min x T (M x + q). Note that the LCP (13) was precisely the same problem used in <ref> [11] </ref> to obtain an error bound for the monotone affine variational inequality (1) in terms of a gradient projection residual. Note also that the error bound (7) of Theorem 1 could be applied directly to (13) to obtain an error bound on both (x; u) and hence on x. <p> Using a residual for the LCP (13) directly requires knowledge of a multiplier u associated with x which we do not have. To avoid an explicit computation of u, a gradient projection residual was used in <ref> [11] </ref>, and in this paper a residual based on a "proximal minimum principle" (3) is employed. 8 3 Error Bounds for the Monotone Affine Variational Inequality We first derive the global error bounds (14) and (32) below, for the monotone variational inequality (1), by using the error bounds (7) and (12)

Reference-contexts: Our principal tool in deriving our bounds here is the error bound that was obtained in <ref> [13, Theorem 2.7] </ref> for the monotone linear complementarity problem. In Section 2 of this paper we give a simplified version of this error bound, and in Section 3 we derive our error bounds for (1), both for a possibly degenerate problem (Theorem 3) and a nondegenerate problem (Theorem 6). <p> The identity matrix of arbitrary dimension will be denoted by I. 5 2 Preliminary Background We begin by giving a simplification of the error bound of <ref> [13, Theorem 2.7] </ref> for the monotone linear complementarity problem N z + p 0; z 0; z T (N z + p) = 0 (5) where N is a k fi k real positive semidefinite matrix, not necessarily symmetric. <p> We shall assume that the solution set of (5), SOL (N; p), is nonempty. By slight modification of the proofs of Lemma 2.5 and Theorem 2.7 of <ref> [13] </ref> and making use of Theorem 2.6 of [10] we obtain the following simplified error bounds in terms of another "natural" residual s (z) (see (8) below). <p> Theorem 1 (Error bound for monotone linear complementarity problems) Let N be positive semidefinite, let the solution set SOL (N; p) of (5) contain z and let ^ N : = 2 For any point z in IR k there exists a z (z) in SOL (N; p) such that <ref> [13, Theorem 2.7] </ref> kz z (z)k (N; p) s (z) + s (z) 2 (7) where s (z) is the residual s (z): = fl fl Nz p; z; z T (N z + p) + fl fl ; (8) (N; p): = k-(N; p) t (N; p) (9) z2SOL (N;p) <p> It was noted in <ref> [13, Example 2.9] </ref> that the square root term in the bound (7) is essential and cannot be dispensed with even locally. 7 In order to apply the above bounds to the monotone affine variational inequality problem (1) we state an equivalent characterization of (1) as a linear complementarity problem in IR <p> This gives the desired inclusion Z T N X. Since we already have that X Y Z, it follows that X N = Y N = Z N The following example from <ref> [13] </ref> shows that the inclusions in Lemma 4 may be strict, even for the case when the linear complementarity problem (13) associated with (1) has a nonde 16 generate solution.
