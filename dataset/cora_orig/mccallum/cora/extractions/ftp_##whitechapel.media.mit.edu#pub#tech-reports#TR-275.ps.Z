Abstract: M.I.T Media Laboratory Perceptual Computing Section Technical Report No. 275 Appeared in Proc. of the IEEE Workshop on Biomedical Image Analysis, Seattle, June 1994 (pp. 70-79). Abstract We have previously described modal analysis, an efficient, physically-based solution for recovering, tracking, and recognizing solid models from 2-D and 3-D sensor data. The underlying representation consists of two levels: modal deformations, which describe the overall shape of a solid, and displacement maps, which employ a multiscale wavelet representation to provide local and fine surface detail. This paper addresses the problem of recovering modal models in the underconstrained case of fitting a 3-D model to contours found in medical slice and X-ray data. We will describe an extension which can be used to incorporate measurement uncertainty while estimating the modal deformation parameters. Finally, we give details about how to compress dense 3-D point data from surfaces, by use of displacement maps and wavelets.

Reference-contexts: Figure 5 shows some examples of superquadrics with displacement maps. In these examples, the displacement map function d (; !) is defined by bilinear interpolation between point samples.

Reference-contexts: equivalent, but when the two surfaces have very different parameterizations it can also be quite difficult to generate sample points at corresponding locations on the two surfaces. 1.1 Modal models Pentland, Essa, and Sclaroff addressed this problem of obtaining a canonical description by adopting an approach based on modal analysis <ref> [18; 8] </ref>. This approach to geometric modeling is based on parameterized implicit functions, for instance, polynomial deformations of superquadric ellipsoid functions. A physical model is developed by dis-cretizing the geometric model via the finite element method, and then making use of Galerkin polynomial approximations for shape interpolation.

Reference-contexts: The bottom row (e,f,g) shows each of the ventricles normalized for cranium shape by warping each patient's cranium to a reference cranium using a modal model as described in <ref> [12] </ref>. which contains the virtual spring forces transformed into the modal basis. Transformation into modal space produces a Fourier-like shape description that is maximally efficient at describing the shape and its physical properties. <p> By discarding the higher-order modes, we get a parametric deformable model representation. The parameters are physically meaningful, and correspond to how much bending, tapering, pinching, etc., is needed to represent an object. As has been demonstrated in <ref> [12; 14; 18; 17] </ref> the modal representation can be quite effective for model recovery, recognition, and nonrigid motion tracking. <p> This allows us to accurately warp the cranial contents so that we obtain inter-patient shape differences that are largely independent of head shape. A related paper appearing in CVPR '94 describes using this approach to obtain more accurate classification of Alzheimer's, normal-pressure hy-drocephalus, and normal patients <ref> [12] </ref>. 1.3 Displacement maps As mentioned in Section 1.1, discarding high frequency modes has many benefits; and as was demonstrated in the previous example, the modal representation can be profitably employed in volumetric data.

These deformations are called free vibration modes and their shapes are represented by a basis transform matrix . Readers are directed to reference <ref> [18] </ref> for more complete explanation of this method. By describing the finite element equations in terms of the object's free vibration modes, the system of equations is decoupled into a superposition of independent, frequency-ordered deformations. <p> The decoupled modal dynamic governing equations can be written in matrix form (shown here with damping neglected): ~ U + ~ K 6 ~ U = ~ R (1) where ~ K 6 is the diagonal modal stiffness matrix as described in <ref> [18] </ref>, and ~ R (t) = T R (t) is the load vector 1 (a) (b) (c) of the human brain created from MR images: (a) normal, healthy adult, (b) Alzheimer's disease causes an enlargement of ventricles, and (c) normal-pressure hydrocephalus causes an even greater enlargement of the ventricles, along with <p> By discarding the higher-order modes, we get a parametric deformable model representation.

This is typically done by attaching virtual springs between sensor measurements and our deformable object, implicitly specifying correspondences between FEM nodes and image features.

In such cases we can resort to solving for the dynamic solution, performing modal analysis with fewer modes <ref> [18] </ref>, or we can solve for the modes via least squares, if we update our least squares to include a strain energy minimization term.

Reference-contexts: This will be a problem when fitting models to dense 3-D data like MR data, because we will not be able to capture local shape 2 details in a meaningful way. To get around this problem, Sclaroff <ref> [19] </ref>, proposed a model recovery framework which incorporates wavelet-based displacement maps to add fine detail to a solid model described by deformable analytic implicit functions. Such maps store surface displacements as a coded relief map, where brighter shades signify positive offsets, and darker shades signify negative offsets. <p> In the context of solid models, displacement maps function by offsetting the analytic surface of the solid along its surface normals. The displacement maps themselves are computed, interpolated and efficiently compressed for storage by using a wavelet representation (quadrature mirror filters) <ref> [21; 19] </ref>. Such a multiscale representation affords not only a method for computing a continuum of shape models, it also provides a framework for regularizing surface scattered point data when actually building the displacement map [16]. <p> To get around this problem, we propose using a wavelet pyramid-based compression and interpolation scheme which significantly reduces the amount of space needed to store a displacement map <ref> [19] </ref>. Figure 6 shows an example of a head's displacement map which can be interpolated at different scales by using a QMF (Quadrature Mirror Filter) pyramid. The displacements were interpolated at three resolutions.

A standard image compression technique for this is pyramid image encoding. This section will describe a multiresolution frequency coding method for representing three-dimensional shape (originally described in <ref> [20] </ref>). The resulting hybrid representation will be a physically-based, parametric model and supplemented with a displacement map which will be used to encode local surface detail.

EPIC typically offers more effective lossless compression rates than a Laplacian pyramid or JPEG image coder. a displacement map (256 fi 256), therefore requiring 65537 bytes. The figure shows the original head, and then its compressed versions at various compression rates.
