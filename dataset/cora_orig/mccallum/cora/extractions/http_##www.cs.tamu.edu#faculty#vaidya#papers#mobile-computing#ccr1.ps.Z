Abstract: The design and analysis of routing protocols is an important issue in dynamic networks such as packet radio and ad-hoc wireless networks. Most conventional protocols exhibit their least desirable behavior for highly dynamic interconnection topologies. We propose a new methodology for routing and topology information maintenance in dynamic networks. The basic idea behind the protocol is to divide the graph into a number of overlapping clusters. A change in the network topology corresponds to a change in cluster membership. We present algorithms for creation of clusters, as well as algorithms to maintain them in the presence of various network events. Compared to existing and conventional routing protocols, the proposed cluster-based approach incurs lower overhead during topology updates and also has quicker reconvergence. The effectiveness of this approach also lies in the fact that existing routing protocols can be directly applied to the network replacing the nodes by clusters.

Reference-contexts: Conventional routing protocols can be broadly classified as distance vector and link state protocols. Distance vector routing uses the classical distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [1, 12, 16, 21] </ref>. Each host maintains for each destination a set of distances through each of its neighbors. In order to maintain up-to-date information, each host periodically broadcasts to each of its neighbors, its current estimate of the shortest path to every other host in the network. <p> For a connected network, the boundary nodes also form a connected network. In this network of boundary nodes, two boundary nodes will have a link between them if they have common clusters; e.g., boundary nodes 3 and 4 have a link between them. A shortest-path algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm <ref> [1] </ref>) is run on this connected network of boundary nodes. If a cluster has multiple boundary nodes, the nodes in that cluster will choose the boundary node with the shortest path for a destination as the next hop node for the destination. <p> Host h will then follow the procedure for host disappearance as explained in Section 3.2. 5 Performance Evaluation 5.1 Complexity This section compares the cluster-based approach's worst-case performance with the performance of Distributed Bellman-Ford (DBF) <ref> [1] </ref>, Ideal Link State (ILS) [8], Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) [8], NP [3] and flooding. The ILS protocol [8] requires that each topology change be transmitted to every node. The DUAL protocol [8] is a distance-vector loop-free algorithm based on internodal coordination spanning multiple hops. <p> The other boundary nodes are considered as non-boundary nodes. The procedure to select a boundary node has been described in Section 3. * x: Number of nodes affected by the topological change. * l: Diameter of the affected network segment.

Reference-contexts: Link state routing generally requires each host to have knowledge of the entire network topology [23]. However, there are link state algorithms (e.g., Nim-rod <ref> [2] </ref>) in which nodes maintain only partial information about the network topology. To maintain consistent information, each host monitors the cost of each communication link to each of its neighbors, and periodically broadcasts an update of this information to all other hosts in the network.

Reference-contexts: In such networks the mobile host has the capability to communicate directly with another mobile host in its vicinity. The mobile hosts also have the capability to forward (relay) packets. Examples of such networks are ad-hoc wireless local area networks [4, 15, 19, 25] and packet radio networks <ref> [3, 16, 18, 24] </ref>.

A distributed routing protocol for mobile packet radio networks is proposed by Corson et al. <ref> [3] </ref>. Similar to [5], routing optimality is of secondary importance. Instead of maintaining distances from all sources to a destination, the protocol guarantees route maintenance only for those sources that actually desire routes. This property helps in reducing the topology update overhead. <p> This process goes on till the message packet reaches the intended destination. This happens provided the destination is connected to the node which originated the flood <ref> [3] </ref>. 2 Loop-free routing requires prevention of loops in the routing tables. We assume that there is negligible amount of user traffic affected by the temporary loops. host can communicate with another host only within a limited geographical region around it. <p> Such a host will be represented in the graph by a disconnected node. A host H v1 is connected to another host H v2 if there exists at least one path from node v1 to v2. Similar to <ref> [3, 24] </ref>, an underlying link-level protocol is assumed which assures the following: * A node is aware of all its neighbors at all times. * All packets transmitted over a link are received correctly and in proper sequence within a finite time. * All control messages are processed one at a <p> Host h will then follow the procedure for host disappearance as explained in Section 3.2. 5 Performance Evaluation 5.1 Complexity This section compares the cluster-based approach's worst-case performance with the performance of Distributed Bellman-Ford (DBF) [1], Ideal Link State (ILS) [8], Diffusing Update Algorithm (DUAL) [8], NP <ref> [3] </ref> and flooding.

Thus, a compromise on routing optimality as suggested in <ref> [3] </ref> to avoid network congestion might not be required. Quick reconvergence in some protocols like DSDV [25] is obtained by quick re-broadcast by each and every recipient of the broadcast, causing degradation of the availability of the wireless medium. <p> However, in our approach, re-broadcast is done only by the boundary nodes. Nodes other than boundary nodes just listen and update their tables. Similar to <ref> [3, 5] </ref> the cluster-based approach does not guarantee shortest path. This is due to the fact that the clusters are created using the first-fit approach, which does not produce the maximum clusters in the graph.

Reference-contexts: One of the most popular techniques for routing in communication networks is via distributed algorithms for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs <ref> [5, 7, 14, 22, 23, 21, 27] </ref>. These distributed algorithms differ in the way the routing tables at each host are constructed, maintained and updated. <p> Conventional routing protocols can be broadly classified as distance vector and link state protocols. Distance vector routing uses the classical distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [1, 12, 16, 21] </ref>. Each host maintains for each destination a set of distances through each of its neighbors. In order to maintain up-to-date information, each host periodically broadcasts to each of its neighbors, its current estimate of the shortest path to every other host in the network.

These distributed algorithms differ in the way the routing tables at each host are constructed, maintained and updated. <p> For each destination, the host determines a neighbor to be the next hop for that destination if the neighbor has the shortest path to the destination. Link state routing generally requires each host to have knowledge of the entire network topology <ref> [23] </ref>. However, there are link state algorithms (e.g., Nim-rod [2]) in which nodes maintain only partial information about the network topology. <p> However, due to long propagation delays, network partitions, etc., some nodes may have inconsistent topology information. This might lead to formation of routing loops. However, these loops are short-term, because they disappear within bounded time (required to traverse the diameter of the network) <ref> [23] </ref>. The new cluster information will be propagated throughout the network. It should be noted that only the boundary nodes are responsible for broadcasting and re-broadcasting any new information. This helps in quick dissemination of information across the network. Thus, the reconvergence of the cluster-based protocols is very quick.

Reference-contexts: In such networks the mobile host has the capability to communicate directly with another mobile host in its vicinity. The mobile hosts also have the capability to forward (relay) packets. Examples of such networks are ad-hoc wireless local area networks [4, 15, 19, 25] and packet radio networks <ref> [3, 16, 18, 24] </ref>. The term ad-hoc network is in conformance with current usage within the IEEE 802.11 subcommittee [4]. Example applications of such networks range from conference rooms to battlefields. <p> Moreover, their protocol requires frequent broadcasts of the routing table by the mobile hosts. The overhead of the frequent broadcasts goes up as the population of mobile hosts increases. Another scheme based on distance vector path-finding algorithm was proposed in <ref> [24] </ref>. Although loops are avoided completely, all the nodes end up sending an update message to their neighbors during a topology update operation. In dynamic networks, where topology updates are frequent, the update overhead may be very high. <p> Such a host will be represented in the graph by a disconnected node. A host H v1 is connected to another host H v2 if there exists at least one path from node v1 to v2. Similar to <ref> [3, 24] </ref>, an underlying link-level protocol is assumed which assures the following: * A node is aware of all its neighbors at all times. * All packets transmitted over a link are received correctly and in proper sequence within a finite time. * All control messages are processed one at a

Example applications of such networks range from conference rooms to battlefields. <p> These distributed algorithms differ in the way the routing tables at each host are constructed, maintained and updated. The primary attributes for any routing protocol are : * Simplicity : Simple protocols are preferred for im plementation in operational networks <ref> [25] </ref>. * Loop-free : At any moment, the paths implied from the routing tables of all hosts taken together should not have loops. Looping of data packets results in considerable overhead. * Convergence characteristics : Time required to converge to new routes after a topology change should not be high. <p> The processing overhead and the network bandwidth overhead of link state protocols are generally more than distance vector protocols. The problems in using conventional routing protocols in a dynamic network have been discussed in great detail in <ref> [15, 25] </ref>. <p> The protocol described in <ref> [25] </ref> addresses some of the above stated problems by modifying the Bellman-Ford routing algorithm. They use sequence numbers to prevent routing table loops, and, settling-time data for damping out fluctuations in route table updates. The convergence on the average is rapid, however, the worst case convergence is large. <p> Thus, a compromise on routing optimality as suggested in [3] to avoid network congestion might not be required. Quick reconvergence in some protocols like DSDV <ref> [25] </ref> is obtained by quick re-broadcast by each and every recipient of the broadcast, causing degradation of the availability of the wireless medium. However, in our approach, re-broadcast is done only by the boundary nodes. Nodes other than boundary nodes just listen and update their tables.
