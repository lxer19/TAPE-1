Reference-contexts: Introduction DQDBsim is a simulation program for the study of the performance of the Distributed Queue Dual Bus (DQDB) Metropolitan Area Network. The simulation is based on the description of DQDB found in <ref> [Ins90] </ref>. Only the Queued Arbitrated (QA) service is modeled by DQDBsim; the inclusion of Prearbitrated (PA) service is under consideration for inclusion in a future release. <p> TRACE experiments do not collect statistics, but rather produce a record of the events that occur during the execution of the protocol. These events are keyed to the event descriptions in Figure 8-1 (p. 189) of the IEEE 802.6 standard <ref> [Ins90] </ref>. Keyword: repetitions (required) Data type expected: integer Allowed values: Must be &gt; 0 Description: If the value is larger than one, DQDBsim will automatically conduct the specified number of repetitions of the experiment and present the averages of reported quantities in the output files.

Reference-contexts: features of DQDBsim, including the automatically varying parameter facility, are best understood from the explanations of the various entries in the description file. 3.1 General Format The experiment description file (a file whose name typically ends in ".edf") is loosely patterned on the structure of X Window System resource files <ref> [SG86] </ref>. Each entry in the file consists of a keyword and a value separated by a colon and at least one space or tab. (NOTE: It is very important that the colon be followed by at least one space or tab.) This structure has several advantages.
