Reference-contexts: There are other possibilities|for example, to accommodate listeners capable of varying input rates, one could combine the low-bandwidth and high-bandwidth signal into a kind of layered code. For the ultimate in generality, FTP could be recast as a Dynamic Protocol <ref> [1] </ref>; in this scenario the code for effecting a file transfer is transmitted in the first phase of the protocol and is executed (in a sandboxed environment) by the host machine.

Reference-contexts: of detail. * a framework for the provision of third-party services: Rather than provide all the functionality itself, the Virtual World vendor may be able to locate and attach to useful third-party services, such as 3 a video compositing service, a speech recognizer, Dinda-Audio, or Takeo Kanade's Virutalized Reality system <ref> [2] </ref>. 3 The Xena System In a broad sense, the Xena system can be viewed as a matchmaker [3, 4, 5, for example], interpreting the resource demands of applications on one hand, and the resources presented by service providers on the other, then acquiring those resources and facilitating the appropriate matching.

The matchmaking tasks that Xena needs to perform are similar in general to what is described in <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, for example. Also, it is possible the database represented in the Semantic Registrar might benefit from the knowledge framework and query language outlined in [12], although that work is targeted at a far more generic notion of knowledge than the domain-specific knowledge used by Xena.

Reference-contexts: If the timer expires, the state is released. This scheme allows for more robust behavior in the face of failures or routing changes than that of a scheme with hard state and explicit setup/teardown protocols. Tenet <ref> [21, 22, 23] </ref> is another system for setting up quality-of-service connections. Tenet offers many of the same advantages as RSVP|the differences between the two lie mainly in the details. Unlike RSVP, Tenet supports both sender- and receiver-initiated reservations. Also, Tenet relies on hard connections rather than soft state.
