Abstract: The radiosity method is particularly suitable for global illumination calculations in static environments. Nonetheless, for applications of image synthesis such as lighting design or architectural simulation, we have to deal with dynamic environments. To make the method usable in a real case, the illumination has to be updated as fast as possible after an object moves. The efficient way is to find the calculations strictly necessary to be recomputed after a change in the scene. The largest part of the computation time is spent on visibility calculation. In this paper, we investigate the possible speed ups in those calculations. We propose the use of the visibility complex for radiosity calculations. The presented study is realized for 2D scenes of convex objects in the static case. We show that the visibility complex is very suitable for radiosity calculations in this context, and that it also allows for efficient updates in the dynamic case.

Once we have a dynamic update of the complex, we are able to identify the changes in visibility and to know exactly which form factors have to be recomputed, recomputation done efficiently with the complex. This can be illustrated with the following example.

Reference-contexts: This meshing strategy traditionally requires many geometric calculations which make it very expensive to use. Most of the computation time in the radiosity method is spent on the calculation of the form factors (still more than 50% of the time in the case of efficient algorithms, e.g. <ref> [12] </ref>) because of the visibility computations. Thus, it is important to have an efficient method to compute form factors, especially in dynamic environments where the geometry of the scene can change and causing the need for some form factors being recomputed.

This approach is based on the physical principle of heat transfer between surfaces and simulates the balance of light energy between radiating surfaces for illumination computations. The radiosity method was first applied to computer graphics in 1984 by Goral et al. [8]. <p> The accuracy of the radiosity solution depends on the discretization (or mesh) of the environment. To have good results the mesh should follow the distribution of light in the environment, with a higher density of elements in areas where the illumination changes rapidly <ref> [24] </ref>. The best method is to use a discontinuity meshing that places mesh boundaries on the ra-diosity discontinuities caused by occlusions [10] (i.e. on shadow limits). This meshing strategy traditionally requires many geometric calculations which make it very expensive to use. <p> Below we show that the visibility complex offers a way to easily compute both the discontinuity mesh and the form factors between objects for a given scene. 2.2 The form factor The form factor is the fraction of energy leaving one surface that arrives at another one <ref> [24] </ref>.
