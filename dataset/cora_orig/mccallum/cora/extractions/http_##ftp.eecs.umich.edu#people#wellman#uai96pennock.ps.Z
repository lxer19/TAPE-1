Abstract: We present a methodology for representing probabilistic relationships in a general-equilibrium economic model. Specifically, we define a precise mapping from a Bayesian network with binary nodes to a market price system where consumers and producers trade in uncertain propositions. We demonstrate the correspondence between the equilibrium prices of goods in this economy and the probabilities represented by the Bayesian network. A computational market model such as this may provide a useful framework for investigations of belief aggregation, distributed probabilistic inference, resource allocation under uncertainty, and other problems of decentralized uncertainty.

Reference-contexts: We do not yet have a general proof of the Convergence Property (except for complete graphs, not presented), but we conjecture that our price adjustment algorithm <ref> (Cheng and Wellman 1996) </ref> does converge for a broad class of MarketBayes economies. <p> We have implemented this example in our market-oriented programming environment, walras, which provides some general facilities for specifying computational markets (Wellman 1993). Given the specification of agents and goods, the walras distributed bidding protocol attempts to find a competitive equilibrium via an asynchronous, iterative, price-adjustment process <ref> (Cheng and Wellman 1996) </ref>. In the walras bidding protocol, each agent submits demand functions for each of the goods they are interested in to the auctions for the respective goods. The auction then sets the price so as to clear its market.

Reference-contexts: uncertain reasoning technology (especially Bayesian networks). 1.1 AGGREGATING BELIEFS Given several agents with incompatible beliefs, how can we aggregate their individual beliefs into a characterization of the group's beliefs? This is a classical question in uncertain reasoning, one that has eluded definitive answers despite the research attention it has attracted <ref> (Genest and Zidek 1986) </ref>. Although we doubt that definitive solutions are forthcoming from any quarter, we point out that market mechanisms of various sorts are widely used in uncertain contexts, and their function as aggregators of belief are well-recognized.

Reference-contexts: In particular, he has advocated setting up a market in scientific claims, where prices summarize consensus opinions about important research questions <ref> (Hanson 1995) </ref>. A prototype of this "Idea Futures" market is in operation on the World-Wide Web, at http://if.arc.ab.ca/IF.shtml. Much work in uncertain reasoning is amenable to dis-tribution, and indeed, belief propagation mechanisms are often specifically designed for this purpose.
