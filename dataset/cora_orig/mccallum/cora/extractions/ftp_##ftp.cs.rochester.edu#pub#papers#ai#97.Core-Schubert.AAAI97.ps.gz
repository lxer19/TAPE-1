Abstract: Mixed-initiative dialogs often contain interruptions in phrase structure such as repairs and backchannel responses. Phrase structure as traditionally defined does not accommodate such phenomena, so it is not surprising that phrase structure parsers are ill-equipped to handle them. This paper presents metarules that specify how phrase structure rules may be restarted or interrupted (including overlapping speech). In the case of overlapping speech or a backchannel response, the metarules allow a constituent to overlap or be embedded inside another constituent that it is unconnected to. In the case of repairs, the metarules operate on the reparandum (what is being repaired) and alteration (the correction) to build parallel phrase structure trees: one with the reparandum and one with the alteration. Consider the utterance, take the ban-um the oranges. The repair metarule would build two VPs, one being take the ban- and the other being take the oranges. The introduction of metarules simplifies the notion of an utterance since a sentence interrupted by an acknowledgment such as okay can still be one utterance formed around the interrupting acknowledgment. Together metarules and phrase structure rules specify the structures that should be accommodated by a parser for mixed initiative dialogs. A dialog parser should also maintain a dialog chart that stores the results of syntactic and semantic analysis of all of the dialog seen so far. This dialog chart will be a shared resource eliminating the need for maintenance of a separate representation of dialog structure by a dialog manager. In addition, the dialog parser can alert the dialog manager to utterances introducing obligations as well as recognizing acknowledgments and responses based on syntactic information. fl The official version of this paper has been published by the American Association for Artificial Intelligence (http://www.aaai.org) metarules operate by creating additional grammar rules. This paper presents metarules that license certain extra-grammatical, interleaved structures. They either allow the parser to skip over certain material (parsing this material separately) or in the case of repairs, construct alternative representations (one for the erroneous material and one for the corrected material). Treating repairs and other disruptions of phrase structure as extra-grammatical simplifies the definition of "utterance" since interruptions do not necessarily terminate an utterance. We will use the term "utterance" to refer informally to a sentence or a single phrase uttered by a speaker, allowing for repairs and acknowledgments. Backchannel responses are disruptions (in the middle of an utterance by another speaker) such as okay or right that act to signal understanding. Parser metarules will handle backchannel responses and repairs by other speakers, and mark them so the dialog manager understands that they are temporary interruptions that do not seize the initiative. Acceptances are syntactically similar to backchannel responses but generally occur at the end of utterances and serve to ground the previous statements. Grounding is the achievement of mutual understanding or mutual acceptance of a plan (Clark & Schaefer 1989). The dialog parser can recognize these acceptances as well as backchannel responses aiding the dialog manager in its work. The parser can also roughly follow the initiative of a dialog since it knows that after an acknowledgment, acceptance, or answer the initiative may be seized or the first speaker may continue with more questions, suggestions, or requests. A dialog manager actively participating in a dialog needs this information in order to decide when to speak. (The term dialog manager is used to describe a higher-level reasoning module that follows the grounding and flow of initiative.)
