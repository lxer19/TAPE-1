Abstract: The problem of finding sequences of motions for the assembly of a given object consisting of polyhedral parts arises in assembly planning. We describe an algorithm to compute the set of all translations separating two polyhedra with n vertices in O(n 4 ) steps and show that this is optimal. Given an assembly of k polyhedra with a total of n vertices, an extension of this algorithm identifies a valid translation and removable subassembly in O(k 2 n 4 ) steps if one exists. Based on the second algorithm a polynomial time method for finding a complete assembly sequence consisting of single translations is derived. An implementation incorporates several changes to achieve better average-case performance; experimental results obtained for simple assemblies are described.

Reference-contexts: The initial graph G (f 0 ) can be found in O (n 2 ) steps. There are k parts, so each graph has k nodes. Testing whether a graph is strongly connected takes O (k 2 ) steps <ref> [1] </ref>. 10 There are O (n 4 ) faces in the arrangement, and traversing the adjacency graph requires O (k 2 n 4 ) operations.

Reference-contexts: Therefore step 1 requires O (n 2 ) operations. A graph representing faces and adjacency relationships in an arrangement of m segments in the plane can be computed in O (m 2 ) steps and has O (m 2 ) faces <ref> [3, 5] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: However, it is shown in [14] that for some assemblies of convex polyhedra, no subassembly may be removed, using general rigid motions, without disturbing the rest of the parts. Homem de Mello and Sanderson <ref> [6] </ref> give a method to calculate the polyhedral convex cone containing the infinitesimal translations allowed by a set of planar contacts in space. This method only considers contacts between parts, and thus cannot be used to decide whether there is a collision-free extended translation.

Reference-contexts: This method only considers contacts between parts, and thus cannot be used to decide whether there is a collision-free extended translation. Krishnan and Sanderson <ref> [7] </ref> address problem 1 by mapping the set of all unit translations onto a two-dimensional grid, and marking grid elements that correspond to collisions between two polyhedra. Any unmarked elements then represent valid removal translations.

Reference-contexts: Our implementation addresses these problems by performing a vertical line sweep <ref> [8, 13] </ref> over the arrangement of O (n 2 ) line segments. An imaginary vertical 12 line passes over the arrangement. The cells cut by the sweep line in its current position are kept in a sorted list; the initial list is found by sorting the lines by slope.

Reference-contexts: The set C (P; Q) = fq p j p 2 P; q 2 Qg is called the configuration obstacle of P with respect to Q. This set is a polyhedron <ref> [9] </ref>. During a translation of P to infinity along d, a point p 2 P moves along the ray p + td. <p> C (P; Q) does not contain the origin, since q p = 0 for p 2 P; q 2 Q would imply p = q, i.e. P intersects Q in its initial placement. In the notation of <ref> [9] </ref>, P is the moving object, Q is an obstacle and the origin is the reference point of P . The set of translations along which P collides with Q is the projection of C (P; Q) on the unit sphere S 2 under a central projection from the origin.
