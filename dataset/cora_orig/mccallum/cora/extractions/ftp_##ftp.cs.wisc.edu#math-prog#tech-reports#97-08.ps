Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the solution of general (not necessarily monotone) complementarity problems. The algorithm is based on a reformulation of the complementarity problem as a nonsmooth system of equations by using the Fischer-Burmeister function. We use an idea by Chen, Qi and Sun and apply a Jacobian smoothing method (which is a mixture between nonsmooth Newton and smoothing methods) in order to solve this system. In contrast to Chen, Qi and Sun, however, our method can be applied to general complementarity problems. Extensive numerical results indicate that the new algorithm works very well. In particular, it can solve all complementarity problems from the MCPLIB and GAMSLIB libraries. 2 Current address (October 1, 1997 | September 30, 1998): Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin - Madison, 1210 West Dayton Street, 53706 Madison, WI; e-mail: kanzow@cs.wisc.edu.

Reference-contexts: However, by using special functions , several authors have recently presented globally and locally fast convergent nonsmooth Newton-type methods, see, e.g., <ref> [25, 16, 13, 28, 5] </ref>. One of the main advantages of most of these methods is the fact that they are usually well-defined for an arbitrary complementarity problem NCP (F ). <p> Basically, we try to take the Jacobian smoothing method from Chen et al. [10]. In addition, we incorporate a gradient step in a similar (but slightly different) way as this is done by some nonsmooth Newton methods <ref> [13, 28, 5] </ref>. Unfortunately, the introduction of these gradient steps makes the updating rules for our smoothing parameter k as well as the convergence theory considerably more technical and complicated. However, it is this gradient step which makes the algorithm applicable to a general nonlinear complementarity problem. <p> As known to the authors, there is currently only one other algorithm available which also has no failures on these problems, namely the semismooth Newton-type method by Chen, Chen and Kanzow <ref> [5] </ref>. Compared to that algorithm, it seems that our Jacobian smoothing method sometimes needs less many iterations, whereas the number of function evaluations is usually higher. This may indicate that the step size rule (17) is not "optimal" and may be improved. <p> It would be interesting to see how our perturbation technique would work if we apply it to other equation-reformulations of the nonlinear complementarity problem like those presented in <ref> [28, 35, 5] </ref>. Finally, it would also be interesting to see how the Jacobian smoothing method would work on mixed complementarity problems. An extension to this more general class of problems seems possible by using, e.g., an idea from Billups [1], see also Qi [35] and Sun and Womersley [39].

This is actually the main motivation for this paper, and the answer is positive. In order to do this, however, we cannot consider the general class of smoothing methods used by Chen et al. [10]. Instead, we concentrate on one particular reformulation of the complementarity problem NCP (F ) and fully exploit the (additional) properties of this special 4 C. KANZOW AND H. PIEPER reformulation. <p> In particular, we show that the algorithm is well-defined for an arbitrary complementarity problem. Basically, we try to take the Jacobian smoothing method from Chen et al. <ref> [10] </ref>. In addition, we incorporate a gradient step in a similar (but slightly different) way as this is done by some nonsmooth Newton methods [13, 28, 5]. <p> In fact, this is also the reason why we concentrate us on the Fischer-Burmeister function: Its merit function is smooth due to Proposition 2.5, whereas the same does not seem to hold for the general class of smoothing functions considered in <ref> [10] </ref>. We now state our algorithm formally. Algorithm 4.1. (Jacobian Smoothing Method) (S.0) Choose x 0 2 IR n , ; ff; ; 2 (0; 1), fl &gt; 0, 2 (0; 1 2 (1 ff)), p &gt; 2 and * 0. <p> The line search rule depends on the search direction chosen in Step (S.2): If d k is the Newton direction, the line search in (17) is used as a globalization strategy. Note that this line search condition is exactly the same as in Chen et al. <ref> [10] </ref>. On the other hand, if d k is a gradient step, we use the standard Armijo rule in (18). The complicated part of the algorithm is in Step (S.4), where we update the parameter k . <p> The complicated part of the algorithm is in Step (S.4), where we update the parameter k . The first part of the updating rules (where condition (19) is satisfied) is also used by Chen et al. <ref> [10] </ref>. The second part is due to the gradient step. In the following list, we give some more detailed comments on the role on these two updating rules: (a) In both updating rules, namely in (20) and (21), we reduce k at least by a factor of 1=4. <p> In case of a gradient step, this is well-known since we use the standard Armijo-rule. In case of a Newton step, we can use Part (a) of Lemma 4.2 and prove the finiteness of m k is essentially the same way as this was done in <ref> [10, Lemma 3.1] </ref>. 5 Global Convergence The aim of this section is to show that any accumulation point of a sequence generated by Algorithm 4.1 is at least a stationary point of . <p> This fact will be important in the proof of Theorem 6.6 below. In order to verify that Algorithm 4.1 eventually takes the full stepsize t k = 1, we state the following Lemma which was shown by Chen, Qi and Sun <ref> [10, Lemma 3.2] </ref>. Lemma 6.4. <p> In this perturbation, we replace an element from the generalized Jacobian by a standard Jacobian of a smooth operator which approximates for ! 0. The basic idea of this Jacobian smoothing method is taken from the recent paper <ref> [10] </ref> by Chen, Qi and Sun. We modified their algorithm in such a way that it becomes applicable to general complementarity problems. Although this modification makes the convergence analysis rather technical (especially the global one), the main convergence results are quite nice. Moreover, the numerical performance is extremely promising.

Reference-contexts: In the following, we give a short summary of the basic ideas of some of these methods which are related to this paper. Nonsmooth Newton Methods: Instead of solving problem (1) by the classical Newton method, one can apply a nonsmooth Newton method based, e.g., on Clarke's <ref> [12] </ref> generalized Jacobian @(x) of at the point x 2 IR n . For example, the nonsmooth Newton methods by Kummer [30] and Qi and Sun [37] solve at each iteration the generalized Newton equation V k d = (x k ); (2) where V k 2 @(x k ). <p> In particular, if m = 1, the gradient rG (x) is viewed as a column vector.

Moreover, Proposition 5.6 provides another sufficient condition for an accumulation point to be a solution of the complementarity problem. 6 Local Convergence In this section, we want to show that Algorithm 4.1 is locally Q-superlinearly/Q-quadratically convergent under certain assumptions. <p> We also stress that the philosophy of these two methods is different, so it is difficult to compare them with each other. On the other hand, however, we could try to compare our algorithm with its underlying semismooth Newton method from De Luca et al. <ref> [13] </ref>. It turns out that our algorithm is more reliable and that we use considerably less many gradient steps. In fact, we have just 34 C. KANZOW AND H.

It would be interesting to see how our perturbation technique would work if we apply it to other equation-reformulations of the nonlinear complementarity problem like those presented in [28, 35, 5].

Reference-contexts: As test problems, we use all complementarity problems and all available starting points from the MCPLIB and GAMSLIB collections. The implemented version of the algorithm differs from the one described before in mainly two aspects: On the one hand, we replaced the monotone Armijo-rule by a nonmonotone variant <ref> [21] </ref>. For the details of the implementation of this nonmonotone Armijo-rule, we refer the interested reader to [32].

Reference-contexts: It has a large number of important applications, and we refer the interested reader to the survey papers by Harker and Pang <ref> [22] </ref> and Ferris and Pang [17]. The basic idea of most algorithms for the solution of NCP (F ) is to reformulate this problem as a nonlinear system of equations, as an optimization problem or as a parametric problem.

The organization of this paper is as follows: The mathematical background and some preliminary results are summarized in Section 2. <p> We believe that this indicates that the smoothing parameter regularizes the Jacobian matrix 0 (x) to some extent. This is also reflected by some known theoretical results, e.g., the Jacobian 0 (x) is nonsingular if F 0 (x) is a P 0 -matrix (see <ref> [26] </ref>), whereas an element from the C-subdifferential @ C (x) is nonsingular only under a slightly stronger assumption (see [13]). We finally stress that we also tested some other parameter settings; there, we usually had some more gradient steps, but still less than for the method from [13].

Reference-contexts: However, by using special functions , several authors have recently presented globally and locally fast convergent nonsmooth Newton-type methods, see, e.g., <ref> [25, 16, 13, 28, 5] </ref>. One of the main advantages of most of these methods is the fact that they are usually well-defined for an arbitrary complementarity problem NCP (F ). <p> Basically, we try to take the Jacobian smoothing method from Chen et al. [10]. In addition, we incorporate a gradient step in a similar (but slightly different) way as this is done by some nonsmooth Newton methods <ref> [13, 28, 5] </ref>. Unfortunately, the introduction of these gradient steps makes the updating rules for our smoothing parameter k as well as the convergence theory considerably more technical and complicated. However, it is this gradient step which makes the algorithm applicable to a general nonlinear complementarity problem. <p> It would be interesting to see how our perturbation technique would work if we apply it to other equation-reformulations of the nonlinear complementarity problem like those presented in <ref> [28, 35, 5] </ref>. Finally, it would also be interesting to see how the Jacobian smoothing method would work on mixed complementarity problems. An extension to this more general class of problems seems possible by using, e.g., an idea from Billups [1], see also Qi [35] and Sun and Womersley [39].

Reference-contexts: Nonsmooth Newton Methods: Instead of solving problem (1) by the classical Newton method, one can apply a nonsmooth Newton method based, e.g., on Clarke's [12] generalized Jacobian @(x) of at the point x 2 IR n . For example, the nonsmooth Newton methods by Kummer <ref> [30] </ref> and Qi and Sun [37] solve at each iteration the generalized Newton equation V k d = (x k ); (2) where V k 2 @(x k ).

Reference-contexts: As a first step in this direction, we show that the whole sequence fx k g generated by Algorithm 4.1 converges to a unique point x fl if certain conditions hold. The proof of this result is based on the following Proposition by More and Sorensen <ref> [31] </ref> (note that their result is fairly general and completely independent of any specific algorithm).

For the details of the implementation of this nonmonotone Armijo-rule, we refer the interested reader to <ref> [32] </ref>. On the other hand, we incorporated a heuristic backtracking strategy in our implementation in order to avoid domain violations which occur quite often since the mapping F in many examples of the test libraries is not defined everywhere.

Reference-contexts: Proof. We first note that the assumed R-regularity of the solution x fl implies that all elements of the C-subdifferential @ C (x fl ) are nonsingular, see [16]. Hence Proposition 2.5 in <ref> [33] </ref> together with Proposition 2.2 shows that x fl is an isolated solution of (x) = 0 and therefore also of NCP (F ). Hence, by Theorem 6.2, the whole sequence fx k g converges to x fl .
