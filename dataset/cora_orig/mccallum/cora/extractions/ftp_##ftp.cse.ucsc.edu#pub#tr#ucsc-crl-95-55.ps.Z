Abstract: Measured Equation of Invariance(MEI) is a new concept in computational electromag-netics. It has been demonstrated that the MEI technique can be used to terminate the meshes very close to the object boundary and still strictly preserves the sparsity of the FD equations. Therefore, the final system matrix encountered by MEI is a sparse matrix with size similar to that of integral equation methods. However, complicated Green's function and disagreeable Sommerfeld integrals make the traditional MEI very difficult, if not impossible, to be applied to analyze multilayer and multiconductor interconnects. In this paper, we propose the Geometry Independent MEI(GIMEI) which substantially improved the original MEI method. We use GIMEI for capacitance extraction of general three-dimension VLSI interconnect. Numerical results are in good agreement with published data and those obtained by using FASTCAP from MIT[NW92], while GIMEI are generally an order of magnitude faster than FASTCAP with much less memory usage.

Reference-contexts: arguments didn't conflict with the fundamentals of MEI, because we have already proven that MEI coefficients are actually not strictly invariant to excitations, but instead, are invariant to excitations on the sense of O (h 2 ), where h = max (h x ; h y ; h z ) <ref> [HSD95] </ref>. As stated above, the local FD equation Eq.6 to Eq.12 also has the error of O (h 2 ), therefore, the total truncation/model error of the final matrix system has the order of O (h 2 ), which is not degenerated by the introduction of MEI equations on boundaries.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, complicated Green's function and disagreeable Sommerfeld integrals make the traditional MEI very difficult, if not impossible, to be applied to analyze multilayer and multiconductor interconnects.

It's clear from the figure that our results are more close to the measured data than those obtained by Finite Difference method (FD). As stated in <ref> [HSD96] </ref>, for larger examples such as 12 lines five dielectric layers, GIMEI is ten times faster than BEM with the difference within 3%. 5.2 A simple 3D example: cube with different longitude in air, compared with FASTCAP as well as FD with zero E field boundary condition To verify the speedup

The calculation of MEI coefficients dominates the total computation time.
