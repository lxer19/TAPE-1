Reference-contexts: The main goal of this design was speed so a non-encoded design was selected. Development of an efficient 4-2 compressor implementation was an important priority in the design work. Several alternate implementations were tried and finally a design based on multiplexors was selected <ref> [3] </ref>. Unfortunately in simulations the original design presented in that paper did not reliably operate in our technology.

Reference-contexts: The logic necessary to develop the partial products is combined with the first level of the tree. Most of the literature seems to suggest that Booth encoding schemes are slightly slower than non-encoded schemes, but require a tree only half the size <ref> [4] </ref>. The main goal of this design was speed so a non-encoded design was selected. Development of an efficient 4-2 compressor implementation was an important priority in the design work. Several alternate implementations were tried and finally a design based on multiplexors was selected [3].

Reference-contexts: The CGaAs implementation was not used in the final version because its 1.4ns delay was judged too slow. 2.2 Final Adder and Exponent Adder Due to the long carry propagation chain (106-bits) in the final adder, an extremely high speed adder was designed using a modified Ling design <ref> [6] </ref>. This adder is also used to perform IEEE-754 rounding on the final result. Due to limited time only nearest-to-zero rounding was implemented.
