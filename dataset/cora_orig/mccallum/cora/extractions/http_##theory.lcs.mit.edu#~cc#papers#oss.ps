Abstract: We propose a new construction for computationally secure secret sharing schemes with general access structures where all shares are as short as the secret. Our scheme provides the capability to share multiple secrets and to dynamically add participants on-line, without having to re-distribute new shares secretly to the current participants. These capabilities are gained by storing additional authentic (but not secret) information at a publicly accessible location.

Basically, this protocol works as follows: The (potentionally large) secret is encrypted with a symmetric encryption function. <p> To prevent an attack by exhaustive search, however, the set of possible secrets must not be too small. Our construction solves an open problem of <ref> [10] </ref>, albeit in a somewhat different way than proposed there. Compared to traditional, unconditionally secure secret sharing schemes the proposed method is very flexible and uses only small shares. The differences lie in the additional use of publicly accessible information and in the security model. <p> For simplicity, we assume that the secret K is an element of a finite Abelian group G =&lt; G; + &gt; with l = log 2 jGj. G could be the set of l-bit strings under bitwise addition modulo 2. A computationally secure secret sharing scheme <ref> [10] </ref> is a protocol between D and the members of P to share a secret K, respective to an access structure such that a) the dealer D transmits a share S i secretly to participant P i , for i = 1; : : :; n, b) all qualified sets of

Reference-contexts: Otherwise, some schemes for K h 0 ; h 0 6= h could be compromised. If the shares cannot be hidden to carry out this computation, the protocols can be modified as follows: Similar to Lamport's one-time user authentication scheme <ref> [11] </ref>, S i is replaced by f (Nh) (S i ) for all i = 1; : : : ; n in the h-th scheme (N is a predefined constant and f (h) (x) denotes h-fold repeated application of f to x).

Reference-contexts: Basically, this protocol works as follows: The (potentionally large) secret is encrypted with a symmetric encryption function. The result is distributed among the participants using an information dispersal protocol <ref> [13] </ref> based on error correcting codes. Any k out of the n participants can reconstruct the encrypted secret.

Reference-contexts: If the access structure allows any subset of k or more of the n participants to reconstruct the secret but not k 1 or less, the secret sharing scheme is called a threshold scheme. It can be implemented with Shamir's construction <ref> [14] </ref> based on polynomial interpolation. Secret sharing schemes for general monotone access structures are known, based on monotone circuit constructions [1, 9]. The surveys by Stinson [16] and Simmons [15] provide a general description of secret sharing schemes. <p> Any k out of the n participants can reconstruct the encrypted secret. To prevent an unauthorized set of participants from learning anything about the secret, the secret key used for encryption is distributed among the participants using a conventional, unconditionally secure secret sharing scheme (e.g. Shamir's threshold scheme <ref> [14] </ref>). Much research in the area of secret sharing has concentrated on the size of the shares. Although the size of the shares is important because the shares have to be transmitted and stored secretly, this is not the only information the participants must know to reconstruct the secret.
