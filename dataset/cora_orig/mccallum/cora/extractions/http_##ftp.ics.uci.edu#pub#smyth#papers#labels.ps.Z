Title: Bounds on the Mean Classification Error Rate of Multiple Experts

Abstract: A database contains N items, each item belonging to one and only one of a finite set of classes. The true class labels for these items are unknown. K experts each provide a set of N classification labels for the N items in the database. In this paper it is shown that given the experts' labels, one can compute simple bounds on the average classification accuracy of the experts relative to the unknown true labels. No assumptions are made about the labelling patterns of the experts or the nature of the data. The bounds are useful in practical classification problems where absolute ground truth is unknown and experts must subjectively provide labels for feature data. The method is applied to the problem of assessing the collective accuracy of geologists who count volcanoes in images of Venus.

Reference-contexts: Of interest in the context of this paper is the accuracy of the volcano labels provided by planetary geologists. 4 In previous work a pattern recognition system for automatically counting volcanoes in the Magellan images of Venus has been developed: the pattern recognition system is described in detail elsewhere <ref> (Burl et al., 1994a) </ref> and is not of direct interest here. As part of the development of the pattern recognition system, several planetary geologists, considered experts in Venus volcanism, provided labels for sets of Venus images as training and test data.

Reference-contexts: trivial upper bound) . 4 Application of the Lower Bound 4.1 Catalog Generation in Scientific Applications In a number of observational sciences such as astronomy and planetary geology, a common step in the scientific process is to convert raw data (such as images) into a catalog of objects of interest <ref> (Fayyad et al., 1996) </ref>. Such catalogs form a standard data product which can be used by other scientists as the basis for quantitative scientific studies (such as investigations of the spatial clustering patterns of objects, etc.). <p> The variability in the labelling appears to be primarily due to the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (relative to small volcano structure) in the SAR images <ref> (Fayyad et al., 1996) </ref>. Each geologist examined sets of images independently and used mouse-clicks within a graphical user-interface to indicate their estimate of where the volcanoes were located within a given image. The first labelling experiment consisted of 4 images and 4 experts (geologists A, B, C, and D).

Reference-contexts: For example, as the noise in the labelling process increases the effect on the estimation performance of certain parametric classification methods has been investigated <ref> (Krishnan and Nandy, 1990) </ref>. Both of these general approaches bear some relation to the problem discussed in this paper and indeed the ratings approach has been used with success on the volcano data (Smyth et al., 1996).

Reference-contexts: The study of volcanic features on the surface of Venus is a key issue in planetary geology due to the predominance of volcanism on the planet <ref> (Saunders et al., 1992) </ref>. Generating a comprehensive volcano catalog from the Magellan data is a prerequisite for more advanced studies such as cluster analysis of the volcano locations.
