Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction A set S is called sparse if there are at most a polynomial number of strings in S up to length n. Sparse sets have been the subject of study in complexity theory for the past 20 years, as they reveal inherent structure and limitations of computation <ref> [BH77, HOW92, You92a, You92b] </ref>. For instance, it is well known that the class of languages polynomial time Turing reducible (i.e. by Cook reductions) to a sparse set is precisely the class of languages with polynomial size circuits. <p> One major motivation for the study of sparse sets, and various reducibilities to them, is concerned with the isomorphism conjectures by Berman and Hartmanis. In 1976, they proved that all the natural NP-complete problems (such as those found in [GJ79]) are isomorphic under polynomial time computable functions <ref> [BH77] </ref>. Based on this evidence they conjectured that all NP-complete problems under polynomial time many-one reducibility (i.e. Karp reductions) are p-time isomorphic.

Reference-contexts: Those results are primarily concerned with various other reducibilities and complexity classes. A number of additional techniques will be needed, including properties of error correcting codes, and a generalization of Mulmuley's NC 2 algorithm [Mul87], combined with an idea of Chistov <ref> [Chi85] </ref>, to compute the rank of a matrix over a finite field. We will show, e.g., if there exists a sparse set hard for P under bounded truth table reductions, then P = NC 2 .

Reference-contexts: The circuit-value problem, abbreviated CVP, of determining whether a Boolean circuit C outputs `1' on input x was shown by Ladner [Lad75] to be complete for P under logspace-computable many-one reductions. Cook <ref> [Coo85] </ref> defined the notion of NC 1 reducibility, and notes that this problem is complete for P under NC 1 reductions. This reducibility is somewhat subtle technically, so we refer the reader to [Coo85] for details. <p> Cook <ref> [Coo85] </ref> defined the notion of NC 1 reducibility, and notes that this problem is complete for P under NC 1 reductions. This reducibility is somewhat subtle technically, so we refer the reader to [Coo85] for details. However, we remark that a consequence of the completeness of CVP is that if CVP 2 NC 1 , then P = NC 1 .

Reference-contexts: It is this conjecture that we address in our paper. The Berman-Hartmanis isomorphism conjecture has generated a lot of research work in this field. Building on earlier work by Fortune <ref> [For79] </ref>, Mahaney [Mah82] showed that if NP has a sparse complete set under polynomial time many-one reducibility, then P = NP. This is the definitive result concerning the nonexistence of sparse complete sets for NP under Karp reductions.

Reference-contexts: Based on similar evidence for P-complete problems under logspace many-one reducibility, Hartmanis conjectured in 1978 that there are no sparse complete sets for P under logspace many-one reductions <ref> [Har78] </ref>. It is this conjecture that we address in our paper. The Berman-Hartmanis isomorphism conjecture has generated a lot of research work in this field.

Reference-contexts: Unlike the NP case, very little progress had been made on this conjecture till very recently. The only known result till last year is due to Hemachandra, Ogihara and Toda <ref> [HOT94] </ref>. They showed that if P has polylogarithmically sparse hard sets, then P = SC, the class of languages recognizable in simultaneous polynomial time and polylogarithmic space. Because of the assumption of polylogarithmic sparsity the result leaves an exponential gap.

Reference-contexts: This is the definitive result concerning the nonexistence of sparse complete sets for NP under Karp reductions. Note that if P = NP, then both conjectures concerning isomorphism and the nonexistence of sparse complete sets for NP are false. Regarding Cook reductions, the famous result by Karp and Lipton <ref> [KL82] </ref> showed that if NP has a sparse hard set then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its second level, p p 2 .

Reference-contexts: On any input x 2 f0; 1g n , the output of each gate is defined in the natural way, as also is the output of the circuit. The circuit-value problem, abbreviated CVP, of determining whether a Boolean circuit C outputs `1' on input x was shown by Ladner <ref> [Lad75] </ref> to be complete for P under logspace-computable many-one reductions. Cook [Coo85] defined the notion of NC 1 reducibility, and notes that this problem is complete for P under NC 1 reductions. This reducibility is somewhat subtle technically, so we refer the reader to [Coo85] for details.

Reference-contexts: They showed that if P has polylogarithmically sparse hard sets, then P = SC, the class of languages recognizable in simultaneous polynomial time and polylogarithmic space. Because of the assumption of polylogarithmic sparsity the result leaves an exponential gap. Very recently, Ogihara <ref> [Ogi95] </ref> made substantial progress toward resolving the Hartmanis conjecture. He showed that if there is a sparse set S that is hard for P under logspace many-one reductions, then P DSPACE [log 2 n]. Our work builds on the work of Ogihara. <p> Note that the sparse set S need not belong to P itself. (Thus our assumption is even weaker than P-completeness as stated in Hartmanis' conjecture.) The framework and basic ideas introduced here are used in all our results. Following Ogihara <ref> [Ogi95] </ref> we define the set A of tuples hC; x; I; bi where C is a boolean circuit, x is an input to C, I is a subset of the gates, and b is a bit (0 or 1), such that the sum mod 2 of the values of the gates
