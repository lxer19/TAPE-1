In the graphics literature we find all three conventions in use. Examples of convention 1 include <ref> [3, 5, 25] </ref>. Examples of convention 2 include [26, 16, 10]. Examples of convention 3 include [9, 7, 11]. Clearly our field uses the best convention (whatever it is)! 2.2 Non-ideal reflectors Most BRDF are not a linear combination of constant and ffi-function.

Reference-contexts: A fine distinction about ideal-specular surfaces is whether the reflectance varies with incident angle (e.g. [22]). We could call these "Fresnel surfaces". In the graphics literature we find all three conventions in use. Examples of convention 1 include [3, 5, 25]. Examples of convention 2 include <ref> [26, 16, 10] </ref>. Examples of convention 3 include [9, 7, 11]. Clearly our field uses the best convention (whatever it is)! 2.2 Non-ideal reflectors Most BRDF are not a linear combination of constant and ffi-function.

Reference-contexts: Sometimes the prefix "perfect-" or "perfectly-" is used instead of ideal 1 . The standard text of radiative heat transfer [23] use convention 1 (diffuse/specular), but also use the term Lambertian. The IES Handbook [20] uses convention 1, but sometimes uses the term "perfectly diffuse". Wyszecki and Stiles <ref> [27] </ref> also use convention 1. However, convention 1 is not consistent with informal usage, where "diffuse" imples matte, and "specular" implies shiney.
