Abstract: A scalar volumetric dataset is regarded as a sampled version of a function mapping points from a three dimensional domain into a four-dimensional space. We present a multiresolution model for the representation and visualization of volume data that is based on a decomposition of the three-dimensional domain into tetrahedra. Multireso-lution is achieved by incorporating a large number of tetrahedralizations that represent the original function at different precisions in the framework of a unified compact model. The model is built through an adaptive incremental approach driven by local coherence. The model supports efficient extraction of isosurfaces, and visualization through projective techniques with adaptive resolution levels, as well as the development of progressive fl Via S.

Reference-contexts: in the three-dimensional case, a result in two dimensions suggests that the problem of minimizing the size of the digital model for a given precision is intractable; also, approximate algorithms that warrant a bound on the size of the solution with respect to the optimal one are hard to find <ref> [1] </ref>. Hence, heuristics can be adopted, which try to obtain a digital model of small size by following either refinement or simplification strategies. Refinement heuristics start from a model based on a simplicial complex whose vertices are a very small subset of dataset S.

Reference-contexts: Given a query precision (ffi; "), worse than (ffi min ; " min ), the desired model is the first one in whose precision is better than, or equal to (ffi; "). Our approach is similar to the method to build pyramidal simplicial complexes described in <ref> [2] </ref>. While in pyramidal simplicial complexes snapshots are taken only at a number of predefined thresholds, we take as many snapshots as possible, which form a totally ordered sequence of better and better models. <p> Then, birth and death provide a simple filter to extract complex i from T . A simple yet efficient data structure to apply such filter has been proposed in <ref> [2] </ref>: T is maintained as a list of k + 1 entries, where each entry corresponds to a level of resolution, and contains a list of all tetrahedra born at that level; tetrahedra in each list are stored in inverse order of death.

Following the approach carried out at Xerox Park <ref> [3] </ref> and Brown University [7], MagicSphere was designed as a generic 3D widget, which defines a spherical volume of interest in the data modeling space. Data contained in this volume can be visualized with different modalities, according to suitable filters associated with MagicSphere.

Reference-contexts: Current optimizations of the Projective Tetrahedra (PT) method reduce the pure rendering cost by generating less facets, therefore reducing image quality to increase speed [33]. In a recent paper <ref> [4] </ref>, results obtained by optimizing the rendering process were compared with those obtained by adopting a data simplification approach. Once a multiresolution hypersurface model is available, an approximated representation i may be used to speed up both the depth sorting and the pure rendering phase. <p> On the contrary, the speedup in overall time achieved by using data simplification is linearly proportional to the simplification operated.

Reference-contexts: A multiresolution representation is critical for the implementation of these tools.

The vertex inserted at each iteration is the point that causes either the maximum warping or the maximum error in the current approximation.

Reference-contexts: Tetrahedral meshes have been widely used to represent irregular volume data both in CAD and in the finite element methods. In the context of volume visualization, a number of techniques have been proposed which are well-suited for tetrahedralized datasets <ref> [15, 29, 33] </ref>. <p> Many rendering techniques have been defined working on a tetrahedral decomposition of spaces: * surface rendering through isosurface fitting, adapting an approach derived from the Marching Cubes algorithm [21]; * direct volume rendering, adopting either projective [23, 29, 33] or ray casting methods <ref> [15] </ref>; * hybrid rendering, when volume and isosurface are rendered in the same image. All of these techniques can be applied to render the multiresolution model T . In the following subsections, we will discuss how the availability of multiresolution hypersurface models can affect visualization.

Reference-contexts: Mesh simplification has been the goal of a number of recent proposals, which significantly reduce the complexity of isosurface meshes <ref> [28, 17, 24] </ref>. A more general approach consists in using approximated representations of the dataset, defined on 2 meshes at reduced resolutions, in order to allow fast visualization when exact precision is not needed. The idea is therefore to work on data simplification rather than on graphics output simplification. <p> In configurations, the MT lookup table, which consists of 16 entries, can be simply defined. The use of simplification techniques in isosurface fitting is very popular, as they decrease the cost of rendering by reducing the complexity of the meshes produced <ref> [19, 28, 17] </ref>. These solutions generally accept a loss in representation precision in order to reduce its size. If a multiresolution hypersurface model is available, an alternative solution is to directly produce simplified meshes by applying MT to an approximated hypersurface model i .

Reference-contexts: Such procedure is based on a sequence of actions called face flips that modify the tetrahedralization only locally: each face flip replaces one, two, or three tetrahedra with four, three, or two new tetrahedra, respectively. For details on the triangulation procedure see <ref> [18] </ref>. <p> Thus, the total contribution of procedure ADD VERTEX to the time complexity is O (n a N ), where n a is the total number of local actions performed. Recalling that n a can be O (n 2 ) in the worst case <ref> [18] </ref>, we obtain that the total complexity for the Delaunay selector is O (n 2 N ).

MC was defined to fit isosurfaces on regular rectilinear cells, but it can be simply modified to 16 Out: 0 triangles Out: 1 triangle Out: 2 triangles manage cell decompositions based on simplicial complexes, and it is hereafter called Marching Tetrahedra 5 (MT).

In the case of scattered and curvilinear datasets, data reduction is a non-trivial problem in general. In this paper, we propose a methodology for building and manipulating volume representations at multiple resolution 1 .

Reference-contexts: Tetrahedral meshes have been widely used to represent irregular volume data both in CAD and in the finite element methods. In the context of volume visualization, a number of techniques have been proposed which are well-suited for tetrahedralized datasets <ref> [15, 29, 33] </ref>. <p> Many rendering techniques have been defined working on a tetrahedral decomposition of spaces: * surface rendering through isosurface fitting, adapting an approach derived from the Marching Cubes algorithm [21]; * direct volume rendering, adopting either projective <ref> [23, 29, 33] </ref> or ray casting methods [15]; * hybrid rendering, when volume and isosurface are rendered in the same image. All of these techniques can be applied to render the multiresolution model T . <p> Moreover, using approximated representations we may speed up the Projective Tetrahedra (PT) algorithm and, at the same time, guarantee higher image quality than in standard optimization approaches <ref> [33] </ref>. <p> Current optimizations of the Projective Tetrahedra (PT) method reduce the pure rendering cost by generating less facets, therefore reducing image quality to increase speed <ref> [33] </ref>. In a recent paper [4], results obtained by optimizing the rendering process were compared with those obtained by adopting a data simplification approach. Once a multiresolution hypersurface model is available, an approximated representation i may be used to speed up both the depth sorting and the pure rendering phase. <p> In this case, the approximation error has to be selected according to the speedup and image quality degradation required by the user. Experiments showed that images with degradations similar to those obtained using the optimizations methods proposed by Williams <ref> [33] </ref> may be produced using datasets with a substantial simplification (e.g. given the BuckyBall dataset and the degradation degree of standard rendering optimizations, similar images can be obtained by using an approximated level with a 10% error), and therefore with much shorter processing times: about 7 sec. per image using standard

Reference-contexts: An efficient solution to visibility ordering of acyclic cell complexes has been proposed by Williams in <ref> [34] </ref>. A three-dimensional simplicial complex is called a Delaunay tetrahedralization if and only if it covers the convex hull of its vertices and the sphere circumscribing each tetrahedron of does not contain any vertex of in its interior.

Reference-contexts: Example are: the use of the octree representation to speed up iso-surface fitting [31] or cell splatting [20]; volume ray casting speed up techniques devised to avoid, whenever possible, tracing sections of the rays by taking into account homogeneity or accumulated opacity [8], or by skipping empty space <ref> [35] </ref>. A relevant problem in isosurface fitting is also the high complexity of output data: very large surface meshes are produced when the Marching Cubes technique [21] is applied to high resolution datasets.
