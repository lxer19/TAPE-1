Reference-contexts: Given that the United States Trademark Office has more than 800,000 active registrations with another 100,000 applications. Sprees could be quite useful in this area. 8 2 Background There has been substantial research related to spell correcting (Durham, et. al., 1983) and to inference on handling errors in spelling <ref> ( Carbonell and Hayes, 1983) </ref>. The aims of those works however are not the same as the goals of Sprees. A spell checker should reliably identify misspellings, but one objective of Sprees is to recognize spellings that sound like words whether they are actually known English words or not.

Reference-contexts: It is a regular grammar that is right-linear and right-linear grammars generate regular languages, which we already know is the language of a Sprees automaton. Regular grammars are 21 the most restricted class of Chomskys grammatical formalisms. Their generative capacity is considered the least powerful <ref> ( Chomsky, 1957) </ref>. The generalizations possible in a Sprees automaton are of the form a*b* which is a sequence of any number of a followed by any number of b. Knowing this helps explain further limitations on how spellings are generalized by a Sprees automaton.

Reference-contexts: In advertising and marketing the most popular method of naming products and companies is to create new words to use as names since these spellings can be registered and protected as trademarks <ref> ( Nilsen, 1994) </ref>. Sprees can recommend new product and company names after training on a list of words that suggest the desired connotations. The resulting words would be easy to say and remember since their spelling would match common pronunciation.

Reference-contexts: Sprees was used in conjunction with stored lists to determine whether words sounded like medical terms, family names, first names, and so forth, 7 and the overall system performed extremely well in locating all references to personally- identifying information <ref> (Sweeney, 1996) </ref>. Sprees also extrapolates nonsense words, which are words that look and sound like English words but in reality have no meaning. For example, " throck" which comes from exposure to words like "throw" and "rock" is a nonsense word.
