Abstract: 2 formed. There are two reasons for this transformation. First, it is necessary to align the temporal sequence of images from the same view for subjective review. Second, the extraction of the inner contour and distance analysis, which is the next step of the procedure, requires the centroid of the contour as a reference point for the extraction process. Based on this centroid a set of imaginary rays are used to obtain a set of points lying along the contour. An interpolation technique is then used to obtain a continuous contour. And a distance analysis is performed. For example, the distance of each point along the contour to the centroid is calculated and plotted against the angle swept by tracing the points along the contour. Based on a one-to-one correspondence between the locations along the contour and the extremum points in this plot, a set of points character-izing the ROI is obtained. III. RESULTS This method of automated extraction of ROI was applied to a set of four hundred and eighty images that are from tunnel views of thirty two subjects. The method detected the ROI in four hundred and twenty images with a success rate of 88%. Because of the failure in the centroid extraction step the method was not able to detect the ROI successfully in oblique views. The automated method was compared to a semi-auto-mated method for detection of ROI. The results obtained using a completely automated technique were found to be the same The comparison indicated that the automated method is as accurate as the semi-automated method. Furthermore, the results obtained by the automated method are reproducible whereas those by the other may not be. A major drawback with the fully automated method is the segmentation step. In case of unsuccessful segmentation, the results generated by the fully automated method are not reliable. Thus, if a better method is employed in place of the current segmentation method, this problem can also be largely eliminated. An implementation of the automated method on IRIS INDIGO/SUN workstation extracts an ROI in less than 30 seconds. The same program can also be used on a PC without a significant increase in the processing time since the program does not make use of any special function of the workstation. The fully automated nature of this method decreases the time required to process large amounts of clinical data and reduces the inherent error associ-ated with the semi-automated method.
