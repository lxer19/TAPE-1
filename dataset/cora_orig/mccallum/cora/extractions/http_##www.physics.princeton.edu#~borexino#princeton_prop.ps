Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction and Physics Background In 1939, Hans Bethe <ref> [1] </ref> provided the first explanation of the energy production inside the Sun that was able to account for the energy flux we have observed over the lifetime of the Earth. This theory is based on thermonuclear reaction processes occurring in the Sun's core.

Reference-contexts: Today, it is the latter process that is thought to be responsible for the production of more than 98% of the energy flowing from stars like the Sun. Our present understanding of the proton-proton chain is shown in Fig. 1. Its overall energy production can be summarized as <ref> [2] </ref>: 4 1 H ! 4 He + 2 e + + 2 -e ; Q = 26:7 M eV: (1) The energy released is radiated in the form of charged-particle kinetic energies, neutrinos, and gamma rays.

Reference-contexts: Q eff represents the amount of energy available for heating the solar core after the neutrinos have escaped. The values are obtained by averaging over the outgoing neutrino spectra. 1 Solar Model <ref> [3] </ref>. <p> Neutrino Deficit The "solar neutrino problem" came into existence nearly 30 years ago, when the pioneering experiment ("Chlorine") of Davis and collaborators [7] showed that the actual number of solar neutrinos (above 0.814 MeV) measured on Earth was only about 1/3 of that predicted by "standard solar model" (SSM) calculations <ref> [3] </ref>, [8]-[10]. Since that time there have been many attempts to understand the origin of the solar neutrino deficit, inspiring many developments on both the experimental and theoretical fronts. Despite these advances, the solar neutrino problem persists today, though the puzzle itself has evolved with our understanding. <p> Their results provide greater insight into the solar neutrino puzzle since the four experiments study different components of the solar neutrino spectrum. Fig. 2 shows the theoretically-predicted SSM spectrum of neutrinos <ref> [3] </ref> emanating from the Sun, as well as the ranges in energy over which the various solar neutrino experiments operate. <p> The - e elastic scattering cross section formula, originally calculated by 't Hooft [34], is quoted in Ref. <ref> [3] </ref>: -(q; T ) = m e L + g 2 g L g R m e x 2 ] (2) with g L = (1=2 + sin 2 fi W ) and g R = sin 2 fi W : (3) In Eq.

Reference-contexts: Issues such as the temperature of the central core, the helium and heavy metal abundances and the opacity and turbulence of the solar interior have been examined. Many refinements in the solar model calculations have been incorporated, such as the inclusion of diffusion <ref> [5] </ref>. Another powerful addition was the requirement that the solar models agree with data from helioseismology measurements [12].

Reference-contexts: These models have established a clear preference for an explanation of solar energy production based on the pp chain (however, see <ref> [6] </ref> for a recent discussion of the CN O cycle and present solar neutrino experiments). It is important to recall that the only direct evidence we have that nuclear fusion powers the Sun is the detection of solar neutrinos here on Earth. <p> The amount of suppression of the 7 Be neutrinos will indicate whether vacuum oscillations or MSW oscillations provide the best explanation. Of all the planned solar neutrino experiments, only Borexino can exclude experimentally the possibility that the Sun shines by CN O fusion reactions <ref> [6] </ref>. Finally, the first real-time measurement of low-energy solar neutrinos might even reveal evidence for some entirely new and unexpected physics. Borexino will measure the recoil-electron energy spectrum from neutrino-electron scattering taking place in a large volume of liquid scintillator. <p> Several oscillation scenarios have been identified, based on the combined results of the existing solar neutrino experiments (see Sec. 1.2 and Fig. 4). The result from Borexino will assist in constraining the acceptable solutions. Fig. 16 shows some expected rate estimates in Borexino, calculated by <ref> [40, 6] </ref>, for several possibilities. In these predictions for the flux Borexino might observe, the only requirement was consistency with the results from the existing solar neutrino experiments. <p> This ability is complementary to the capabilities of the SNO and Super-K experiments. These two future experiments look at the distortion of the 8 B neutrino energy spectrum and could observe evidence for MSW oscillations therein; but, only in the case of the small-angle solution. A "CNO solution" <ref> [6] </ref> is also included in Fig. 16. A measure of the neutrino-induced electron recoil rate (and spectral shape) at energies less than 1.5 MeV enables an empirical identification of whether it is the CN O or pp cycle that is responsible for most of the energy production in the Sun. <p> This would also be an interesting and valuable result. the SSM-predicted rate. In each scenario, ranges are illustrated that represent the rates that could be observed by Borexino and that would still be consistent with the four existing solar neutrino experiments. From <ref> [40, 6] </ref>. Note that neutral-current scattering for and- t contribute to the observed rate, even in the scenario of total MSW flavor conversion. A distinctive signature that the detected neutrinos in Borexino have solar origin lies in the annual variation of the measured rate.

Reference-contexts: Many of these concerns were addressed by checks and refinements in nuclear astrophysics cross section measurements (see <ref> [11] </ref> for a review of nuclear physics developments related to solar neutrinos). Other uncertainties in the solar models could also result in inaccurate predictions for the neutrino fluxes.

Another powerful addition was the requirement that the solar models agree with data from helioseismology measurements <ref> [12] </ref>. There is now excellent agreement between solar model predictions and helioseismology data (e.g. the SSM-predicted sound velocities agree with observations within 0.2%, implying that the SSM temperature and molecular weight profiles are accurate to that level [13]).

Thus, helioseismology provides a tight constraint on the nature and behavior of possible solar models. These developments have strengthened the reliability of the solar model neutrino flux estimates, making it very difficult to find a solar physics 2 solution to the solar neutrino problem.

Reference-contexts: In addition, the results from the Kamiokande experiment can be interpreted as an absolute measurement of the 8 B neutrino flux (above the detector's threshold). This fact leads to a model-independent prediction <ref> [20] </ref> that the Chlorine experiment should observe at least 3.2 SNU arising solely from the Kamiokande-normalized 8 B neutrinos. This is higher than the Chlorine result of 2:55 0:17 (stat) 0:18 (sys) SNU, and leaves no room for the SSM-predicted contributions from 7 Be, CN O, and pep neutrinos.

Among the neutrino physics scenarios postulated, neutrino flavor oscillations are considered to be a promising explanation of the deficit. Neutrino flavor oscillations <ref> [21] </ref> require only that neutrinos have a non-zero mass, and that flavor mixing occurs in the lepton sector (analogous to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing in the quark sector). As a result, an initially-pure neutrino flavor eigenstate can have a different flavor composition after propagating some distance through vacuum.

These resonant matter oscillations, known as the MSW effect <ref> [24] </ref>, can give rise to a significant neutrino deficit over a much wider range of acceptable parameters than with vacuum oscillations.

Reference-contexts: In order to contend with this potential background, rapid transport of the scintillator to the underground site followed by purification (to remove the cosmogenic 7 Be) and underground storage (decay with t 1=2 = 53 d) is planned <ref> [35] </ref>. In this overview of the backgrounds in Borexino, there is a particular source to single out: radon. The isotope 222 Rn has a half-life of 3.82 days and being a noble gas, is very mobile. <p> The PPO contained several ppm of potassium which was effectively removed by both water extraction and vacuum distillation. Of particular interest were the studies using 7 Be produced in situ using the Princeton cyclotron <ref> [35] </ref>. This isotope is produced by cosmic-ray interactions on carbon and must be removed before the scintillator is placed into the detector. Distillation was found to be extremely effective at removing the 7 Be impurity, reducing the concentration more than 1000-fold in a single step.

Reference-contexts: the 7 Be solar neutrinos. 9 photomultiplier tubes, and the outer water container. 10 3 Prior Results from the Counting Test Facility (CTF) When Borexino was first proposed, direct radioactive-impurity limits in scintillators were only possible for small samples and at sensitivities many orders of magnitude worse than Borexino's requirements <ref> [36] </ref>. The international review committee of that proposal concurred with the collaboration's request to build a Counting Test Facility. The CTF was designed to confirm experimentally the belief that organic liquid scintillators could be obtained with adequate purity for Borexino. Funding was provided by the INFN of Italy, Bundesministerium f. <p> The investment by the collaboration and its funding agencies has proven its value as we move forward towards Borexino. 18 4 The Borexino Detector The design for the full-scale neutrino detector presented here is similar to the original design given in the INFN and NSF Proposals of 1992 <ref> [36] </ref>. However, some new features have been added to cope with issues discovered in the prototype Counting Test Facility (CTF) detector. These new components are the muon veto and the radon barrier. <p> These backgrounds have been evaluated and are negligible (contribute less than 0.1 counts/day). A longer discussion of these backgrounds is found in the original INFN and NSF proposals <ref> [36] </ref>. 32 5.3 Physics from Borexino The main item on the physics program for Borexino is the measurement of the flux of 7 Be solar neutrinos and the investigation of neutrino oscillations as a solution to the solar neutrino problem.

Reference-contexts: With the cooperation of Miles-Mobay and Bayer Chemie, an amorphous nylon co-polymer (C38F) was obtained and a special extrusion was made of the nylon which produced sheets with high optical clarity at the thickness required (0.5 mm). A solvent bonding technique was developed <ref> [37] </ref> which allowed reliable joints to be achieved. With these solutions, nylon was adopted and prototyping of the full-scale vessel began. The final fabrication was performed under clean-room conditions at Princeton and exposure to Rn daughters was minimized by protective coverings.

Reference-contexts: Equipment was fabricated from electro-polished stainless steel, Teflon, and quartz, with particular emphasis on cleanliness. The plant was designed to process 50 L scintillator/hr in the water extraction mode, and 20 L scintillator/hr in the distillation mode <ref> [38] </ref>. Components were thoroughly washed with deionized water, packaged in sealed, metallized plastic bags (to prevent radon permeation) and shipped to Gran Sasso for final assembly. The purification system was enclosed in a class 100 clean room located at the top of the water shielding tank for the CTF.

Reference-contexts: The phototubes (PMT's) are the 20 cm diameter Thorn-EMI 9351 model, produced with special low radioactivity glass (Schott glass 8346). A special light concentrator, similar to the "Winston cone" <ref> [39] </ref>, is mounted on each phototube, thereby increasing the efficiency for detecting the light by a factor of about three. The effective photocathode area coverage of the PMT's and light cones is about 35%.
