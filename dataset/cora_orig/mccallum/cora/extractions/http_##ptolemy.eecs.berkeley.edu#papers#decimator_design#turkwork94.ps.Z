Abstract: The paper gives an automated procedure to design rational decimation compression systems that resample two-dimensional bandpass signals at their Nyquist rates. The procedure takes a sketch of the passband in the frequency domain, circumscribes it with a parallelogram, and linearly maps the parallelogram onto one period of the frequency domain. Thus, the compression system only has linear components.

Reference-contexts: In video processing, two-dimensional decimators can be used to convert sequences of images from interlaced to non-interlaced format. These decimators preserve the frequency content in a diamond-shaped (i.e., parallelogram-shaped) passband centered at zero frequency. Seismic data is sampled in position and time <ref> [1] </ref>. Data falling on the same position-time line corresponds to waves having the same velocity. Fan filters are used to pass ranges of velocities. When the range of passed velocities is small, the fan filters produce "narrowband" signals. <p> We approximated the circle with a twenty-sided polygon whose vertices were given by a simple Mathemat-ica formula. The design procedure reported a packing efficiency of 79.2% and an 8-to-1 compression ratio. The best packing efficiency, 86.6%, is obtained by circumscribing the passband with a regular hexagon <ref> [1] </ref>. For non-linear compression, the theoretical upper limit on the compression ratio is 4, which is approximately 12.5-to-1. 4 CONCLUSION In some image, video, seismic applications, only a portion of the frequency content of the signals is important.

Reference-contexts: From the polygonal passband, the automated procedure will compute the parameters for the compression system shown in environment.

Rational decimation systems extract a connected portion of the frequency domain (the passband) and resample it at a lower rate. <p> Second National Turkish Workshop on Signal Processing 178 We have implemented the ideas in a set of signal processing packages and notebooks <ref> [3, 4] </ref> for the computer algebra system Mathematica. Our implementation allows the designer to specify the passband graphically using a mouse. For example, the designer could sketch the area of interest on top of a plot of the two-dimensional spectrum. Our implementation, however, does not design the two-dimensional filter.

Reference-contexts: Step 3 only requires averaging the four vertices of the parallelogram to find the shift vector. We implement Step 4 according to <ref> [5] </ref>. From the rational matrix H computed in Step 4, Step 5 decomposes H into its Smith-McMillan form H = U fl V , where fl is a diagonal matrix with rational numbers along the diagonal and where U and V are integer matrices with determinant +1 or 1. <p> The decimation filter has a passband that is a parallelepiped symmetric about the origin whose vertices are L 1 M v i for i = 1 : : : 4 where v = f (1; 1); (1; 1); (1; 1); (1; 1)g <ref> [5] </ref>. An area of future research could be the automation of the design of perfectly reconstructing two-dimensional filter banks [8, 9] based on an arbitrary geometric split of the fundamental frequency tile. Such an approach would utilize subband geometries that can be maximally decimated, i.e., parallelograms and regular hexagons.
