Title: Collaborative Information Retrieval: Gopher from MOO  
Author: Larry Masinter, Erik Ostrom Larry Masinter Erik Ostrom 
Note: Gopher from MOO Proc. INET '93  
Abstract: There are two visions of how use of the global network will evolve in the future. First, individuals will use the network as a resource, providing access to material from libraries and other suppliers of information and entertainment. Second, in addition to communicating with these data sources, people will communicate with each other, using a variety of interactive text, audio, and video conferencing methods. This paper is about a system that combines the two uses: adding an information retrieval tool (Gopher) to a `text based virtual reality' environment (MOO). The combination allows informal collaboration using information retrieval to happen across the network.

Reference-contexts: III. Users and communities After the initial Gopher room was working, we advertised its existence on the comp.infosystems.gopher newsgroup. There was a fair amount of response from that announcement; in particular, one user logged on, looked around, and wrote a review that he posted on netnews <ref> [11] </ref>; this brought a wave of biologists to the MOO. A group of biologists is currently building an electronic meeting center, designed for virtual conferences but also for informal discussions.
