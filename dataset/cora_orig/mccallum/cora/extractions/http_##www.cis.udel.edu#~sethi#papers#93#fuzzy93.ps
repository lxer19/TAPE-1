Abstract: Routing is an important functional aspect of a data communication network that handles data packets during their transit from source to destination. The efficiency of a distributed dynamic routing algorithm depends on how well it adapts to the traffic and topology changes in the network. The nodes in the network periodically exchange information regarding these changes for efficient routing. The information used by the algorithms to arrive at the routing paths suffers from uncertainty due to a variety of reasons. In this paper, we apply certain aspects of fuzzy sets to model the uncertainty in the delay information and use this new delay representation to improve the performance of one particular class of routing algorithms in computer networks.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we apply certain aspects of fuzzy sets to model the uncertainty in the delay information and use this new delay representation to improve the performance of one particular class of routing algorithms in computer networks. Routing algorithms in computer networks can be classified in different ways <ref> [1, 11] </ref>. A distributed dynamic routing algorithm is one in which each node in the network makes decisions regarding the optimal paths independently of other nodes and is adaptive to the changes in the traffic patterns and topology of the network. <p> The update sent by a node contains the state of each of its adjacent links as well as the delays in its own outgoing queues. An example of a distance-vector algorithm is the distributed Bellman-Ford algorithm <ref> [1, 14] </ref> that was used in the old Arpanet routing protocol. This algorithm suffers from a number of problems that include routing-table loops and counting to infinity. But some distance-vector algorithms have been recently proposed that eliminate these problems [3, 5, 8]. <p> Since at every stage, the shortest path lengths D j are chosen, the algorithm guarantees that when it converges, the path length from s to i is the shortest <ref> [1] </ref>. Using the above mentioned algorithm and the data structures, the routing procedures for delay measurement, updating policy and the routing path calculation that have been developed using the concepts of Fuzzy Sets are presented below. Delay measurement : The delay measurement is straightforward.

Reference-contexts: The estimates of the queuing delays are obtained by multiplying the mean packet transmission time with the averaged values of the queue lengths. The fuzzy weighted means of both the delays (TFNs) are computed using an ordering method proposed by Ronald Yager <ref> [12] </ref> for the fuzzy subsets of the unit interval I which is easily extended to TFNs by reducing the TFN to unit interval through normalization.
