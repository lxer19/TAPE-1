Reference-contexts: Corollary 3. If x k and ^x k converge with degrees p and ^p &gt; p, then e k = o (^e k ): Let ' be a function with a fixed point x fl . A classical result (e.g., see <ref> [1, p. 64] </ref>) says that the iteration x k+1 = '(x k ); k = 0; 1; : : : converges locally to x fl provided j' 0 (x fl )j &lt; 1.
