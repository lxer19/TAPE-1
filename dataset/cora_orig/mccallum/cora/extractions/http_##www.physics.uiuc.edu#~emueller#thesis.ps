Reference-contexts: I should also note that a coupling of the form (1 z )t x has been used previously in a discussion of quantum measurements the model where it was used is commonly referred to as the Coleman-Hepp model <ref> [2] </ref>. In this thesis no attempt will be made to derive the parameters in either equation (2.5) or (2.6) from a microscopic model for any particular system.

Reference-contexts: Those unfamiliar with this formalism should read Appendix A and Appendix B. More detailed accounts 15 of path integrals can be found in [12, 13], and papers specifically involving the spin-boson problem are <ref> [3, 7, 10, 18, 33, 35] </ref>. This chapter is fairly complex, and organized as follows. In section 3.2 we set up a formal expansion for the reduced density matrix (t) for the combined system and apparatus, with the oscillator bath integrated out. <p> Thus if blips i and j are well separated compared to their length, then we have that fl s ij will be small. For a calculation of the other coupling constants one can look at Dube <ref> [7] </ref> or Leggett [18]. I should note however that by inspection the fi's are zero. Of interest to us right now is that the diagonal terms fl s ii are equal to Q s 2 (t 2j t 2j1 ). <p> The non-interacting blip approximation for the PISCES model essentially has the same limits of validity as this approximation does in the spin-boson model, with the caveat that the direct coupling energies must be taken into account (further information can be found in <ref> [7] </ref>). If the direct coupling energies remain smaller than both the thermal energy and the biases then the above criteria should suffice. <p> To fix this we will reparametrize our blips. The argument is based upon one given by Dube in <ref> [7] </ref>. However, in Dube's derivation he failed to notice that one could perform a simple "Dyson sum" of an infinite set of different paths; his method was instead based on a very complicated analysis of the combinatorical factors involved in the different paths. <p> It is here to illustrate the connection between the method of section 3.3, and the one used in <ref> [7] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We believe that this model is the first such realistic model which is analytically tractable and takes into account all of the physics relevant to the measurement process. This model is an extension of one solved by Dube and Stamp <ref> [8] </ref>; the details of the model and how it differs from the model of Dube and Stamp will be discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. In Chapter 3 the dynamics of the new model will be solved. <p> We refer to this model as PISCES, for a "Pair of Interacting Spins Coupled to an Environmental Sea". The model consists of two 2-level systems (aka. spin- 1 2 systems) and a bath of harmonic oscillators. A particular form of this model was developed first by Dube and Stamp <ref> [8] </ref>; here we develop the model in a different direction, one that generalizes their results, and is more appropriate the the quantum measurement problem. 2.1 The System Just as a Geiger counter detects particles, and the Stern-Gerlach experiment measures the magnetic moment of a silver atom, our measurement model needs to <p> We will justify our choice of couplings shortly. This model generalizes the PISCES model used by Dube and Stamp <ref> [8] </ref> in that we have added the direct coupling K ij , and allowed biases * m and * s . This significantly increases the utility of the model, especially in regards to looking at quantum measurements.

Reference-contexts: However, a measurement of the combined system will detect the interference (ie. a measurement of any correlation between the 2 systems). This point in crucial to the famous paradox of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen <ref> [9] </ref>. Formally speaking, the silver atoms in the Stern-Gerlach experiment are in a state analogous to equation (1.3) after they leave the magnetic field, but before they hit the glass plate.

Reference-contexts: This analysis is of course very primitive. We now proceed to a much more realistic model. 2.3.1 The Oscillator Bath Model of the Environment To model our environment, we will adopt the famous model of Feynman and Vernon <ref> [10] </ref>. This describes the environment as a bath of oscillators with Hamil-tonian H osc = ff=1 p 2 2m ff 1 m ff ! ff x 2 where x ff is the coordinate of an environmental oscillator, m ff its mass, ! ff its frequency, and p ff its momentum. <p> Within certain guidelines discussed in Chapter 3 we will assume an arbitrary distribution of oscillators in our bath. A short discussion of oscillator baths is contained in Appendix A, and more detailed material appears in <ref> [10, 12, 16, 18, 33] </ref>. 2.4 Assembling the Model We now have a model consisting of a 2-level measuring apparatus (with Pauli matrices t ), a 2-level system which is being measured (with Pauli matrices ), and a bath of oscillators. <p> Those unfamiliar with this formalism should read Appendix A and Appendix B. More detailed accounts 15 of path integrals can be found in [12, 13], and papers specifically involving the spin-boson problem are <ref> [3, 7, 10, 18, 33, 35] </ref>. This chapter is fairly complex, and organized as follows. In section 3.2 we set up a formal expansion for the reduced density matrix (t) for the combined system and apparatus, with the oscillator bath integrated out. <p> Following Feynman and Vernon <ref> [10] </ref> we define a functional F [q s ; q 0 m ] by s ; q m ; q 0 Z Dr A bath [r] A fl bath [r] A 1b [q s ; r] A fl 1b [q 0 2b [q 0 This is the "Influence Functional". <p> With it, no explicit mention of the state of the environment need be considered. In <ref> [10] </ref> this path integral is evaluated, and the can be expressed as: F [q s ; q 0 m ] = exp 1 Z t dt 0 X [f ff (t ) f 0 ff (s)fl ff (t; s)] (3.10) where f ff (t ) = C s ff q m <p> More general couplings can also be evaluated (see <ref> [10] </ref>). 39 Appendix B P () in The Spin Boson Problem In this chapter I would like to recall the form of P () (the Laplace transform of P (t)) for the single spin interacting with an oscillator bath (the "spin-boson" problem).

For our particular model the configuration space divides canonically into the state of each 2-level system and the state of the oscillators. <p> There are many discussions of path integrals in the literature, both introductory and advanced. An excellent introductory treatment can be found in Feynman and Hibbs' book <ref> [12] </ref>. A.1 The Propagator The main object of interest in this formalism is the Propagator, also known as the Kernel, or the Greens Function. Written K (b; a; t), the propagator gives the amplitude for the system to go from state a to state b in a time t. <p> I will not however show how to solve this problem. The procedure is relatively straightforward given that the action is quadratic, so one only needs to integrate Gaussians. The result from Feynman and Hibbs <ref> [12] </ref> is that if we have a Lagrangian L = 1 2 m _x 2 1 2 m! 2 x 2 then the propagator from x a to x b in a time t is K (x b ; x a ; t) = 2ih sin !t exp im! fi a

Reference-contexts: What happens at the plate is exceedingly complex, but once again it is clear the this process is highly irreversible. 1.2.4 An Abstracted Measurement System I would like to present one more "measurement system". This model, which can be found in Jauch's book <ref> [14] </ref>, consists of a 2-level system to be measured and a 3-level apparatus performing the measurement. We will label the states of the system as + and , and the states of the apparatus as + , , and 0 .

Reference-contexts: This gives detailed information about the measuring process, but does not allow us to model more elaborate sequences of measurements as discussed by Leggett and Garg <ref> [17] </ref>. Finally, Laplace Inversion of the density matrix is rarely straight-forward, especially for the general results (equation (3.41)). This is not a fatal flaw, as there are more sophisticated analytic avenues available that we have not yet considered, and also numerical methods such as Monte Carlo simulations.

Reference-contexts: My language here has been quite imprecise, but before I embark on any clarification, I must emphasize that there are many macroscopic physical systems with collective coordinates for which such a truncation can be carried out. Two well studied systems are an rf-SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) <ref> [18] </ref> and a magnetic grain [29]. Although I do not wish to say anything rigorous about this truncation process, I would like to clarify the above discussion. A slightly more detailed look at how one would truncate a Hamiltonian is probably the most enlightening way to do this. <p> Within certain guidelines discussed in Chapter 3 we will assume an arbitrary distribution of oscillators in our bath. A short discussion of oscillator baths is contained in Appendix A, and more detailed material appears in <ref> [10, 12, 16, 18, 33] </ref>. 2.4 Assembling the Model We now have a model consisting of a 2-level measuring apparatus (with Pauli matrices t ), a 2-level system which is being measured (with Pauli matrices ), and a bath of oscillators. <p> cannot be coupled in such a way that they modify the barrier height between the two well, thus coupling via a x or t x term? Unfortunately a full discussion of this goes beyond the scope of this paper, and we must refer the 13 reader to Leggett et al. <ref> [18] </ref> where it is shown that such interactions will only renormalize the tunneling matrix elements s and m . Given these arguments, equation (2.5) is the most general Hamiltonian possible that includes a system, a measuring apparatus, and a linear environment. <p> Previous discussions have either left out the environment (cf. Chapter 1) or the apparatus (cf. the work of Leggett et al. <ref> [18] </ref>). 14 Chapter 3 PISCES Solution in the Non-Interacting Blip Approximation 3.1 Introduction In this chapter I would like to calculate the dynamics of the PISCES model in as much generality as possible. <p> Those unfamiliar with this formalism should read Appendix A and Appendix B. More detailed accounts 15 of path integrals can be found in [12, 13], and papers specifically involving the spin-boson problem are <ref> [3, 7, 10, 18, 33, 35] </ref>. This chapter is fairly complex, and organized as follows. In section 3.2 we set up a formal expansion for the reduced density matrix (t) for the combined system and apparatus, with the oscillator bath integrated out. <p> The physical significance of these functions is discussed in [3]. It would probably be appropriate to comment upon plausible forms for the spectral densities, but this would necessitate a lengthy discussion of cut-off frequencies and renormalizations (see for instance <ref> [18] </ref>). We certainly need to assume that these are smooth functions which approach zero as ! ! 0 or 1. For making quantitative statements it will also be convenient to have a power-law behavior for small !. <p> It is convenient to consider q and q 0 together, defining ~ = 1 2 (q q 0 ) and 2 (q + q 0 ). Following Leggett <ref> [18] </ref> we call a time interval where ~ 6= 0 a "blip", and an interval where 6= 0 a "sojourn". For the n th blip we define a "charge" n = ~, and for the n th sojourn we define n = . <p> Thus if blips i and j are well separated compared to their length, then we have that fl s ij will be small. For a calculation of the other coupling constants one can look at Dube [7] or Leggett <ref> [18] </ref>. I should note however that by inspection the fi's are zero. Of interest to us right now is that the diagonal terms fl s ii are equal to Q s 2 (t 2j t 2j1 ). This term is also referred to as the "self-energy" of the blip. <p> I first will discuss the limits of validity of the non-interacting blip approximation in the spin-boson model. One domain of validity (see Leggett et al. <ref> [18] </ref>) is the overdamped regime. More precisely, in the ohmic case (q=1 in equa tion (3.5)) at low temperature (k B T &lt; *) the approximation will hold as long as ! c (3.21) where ff is the dimensionless coupling constant equal to =h. <p> This result is used in equations (3.50) through (3.52). This is no more than a paraphrasing of select parts of <ref> [18] </ref>. <p> It is shown in Appendix E of <ref> [18] </ref> that lim h = tanh (*=2K B T ) (C.5) 42 C.1 The Over-Damped Regime The overdamped regime is by far the simplest regime to work in.

Reference-contexts: The argument for dissipation being necessary for measurement is essentially that it allows for a physical picture of how the wave-function collapses. No other physical mechanisms for such a collapse has ever been found (although psychophysical processes have been advocated <ref> [38, 32, 22] </ref>). 11 Intuitively it seems fairly clear that coupling to a heat bath introduces ran-dom perturbations, and that random perturbations send a system into a random state. Thus a coherent mixture of states drops into a statistical mixture of states.

Reference-contexts: g @ j=1 j ; ~ m 1 0 m Y F 2 ( m j ; ) A (3.32) with F 1 ( s j ; ) = 0 Equation (3.32) is vaguely reminiscent of an expression for the partition function of an Ising chain (see Plischke and Bergersen <ref> [23] </ref> x3.6). The main impediment to performing the sum is that the relationship between and ~ is not at all simple. For rather technical reasons, this approximation breaks down if our paths begin or end in blips. Thus we can only calculate the diagonal elements of the density matrix.

Reference-contexts: It should be noted that there are some environments (such as a bath of nuclear spins <ref> [24] </ref>) that are not representable in terms of an oscillator bath.

Reference-contexts: The projection postulate is sometimes referred to as the "collapse" of the wavefunction. The mechanism by which these postulates are implemented is by no means obvious. An appealing argument, which I will elaborate later, is that `friction' 1 Translated by John D Trimmer in <ref> [27] </ref> 5 takes care of these things. That is, in describing the macroscopic measuring apparatus (the cat) we have ignored either internal degrees of freedom, or external degrees of freedom to which the apparatus (cat) is coupled.
