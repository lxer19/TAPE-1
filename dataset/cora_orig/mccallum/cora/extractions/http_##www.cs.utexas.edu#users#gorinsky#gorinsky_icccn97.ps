Abstract: Traffic reshaping and its impact on providing deterministic guarantees of timely data delivery in a packet-switched virtual-circuit fixed-packet network are investigated. Two types of traffic smoothing are considered: global reshaping (when traffic on all network connections is smoothed) and local reshaping (when the traffic specification is changed only for a single connection). The conditions when reshaping is beneficial are derived and the optimal values of traffic model parameters are obtained. In particular, it is shown that, when one tries to minimize end-to-end delay bounds for leaky bucket constrained traffic, the traffic either should be made Constant Bit Rate (CBR) or should not be reshaped at all. It is proven that changing the leaky bucket specification to the dual leaky bucket specification is always able to yield better timeliness guarantees and utilization of network resources. Finally, local reshaping for the dual leaky bucket model is studied.

Reference-contexts: A multirate specification was shown to be useful for efficient description of VBR data [9]. The corresponding shaping of traffic can be performed by a series of leaky buckets [1]. We consider the dual leaky bucket model which was accepted as a standard by the ATM Forum <ref> [3] </ref>: traffic is described through a tuple of parameters (; 0 ; ; t ) where is the size of the maximum instantaneous burst on the connection, 0 is the maximum peak rate, is the maximum average rate ( 0 ), and t is the maximum peak duration.

Reference-contexts: Let us globally reshape traffic so that the traffic specification for every connection is changed from (; ) to ( 0 ; 0 ; ; 0 0 ) dual leaky bucket specification where 0 0 and 0 (see Figure 2). According to the schedulability conditions given in <ref> [4] </ref>, the minimum end-to-end delay bound that can be guaranteed to a connection C without reshaping equals to: d c = ( k2S l k When the reshaping is applied, delay of sending data over link k cannot exceed: (; ) to ( 0 ; 0 ; ; 0 d 0 <p> Let us reshape traffic on connection C by reducing its burstiness from to fl , where fl 0, and decreas ing the peak rate from 0 to fl , where fl , (see connections unchanged. According to <ref> [4] </ref>, the minimum delay bound that can be guaranteed over link k without reshaping is equal to: 0 ): (a) information about the links forming connection C; (b) the minimum end-to-end delay bound d c 0 as a function of the peak rate 0 . d k = max l k

Reference-contexts: Using the same approach as in [2, 10], one can easily prove that shaping does not increase end-to-end delay bounds. Thus, shaping delays are ignored in the analysis below. We also disregard switching and alignment delays. A more detailed description of the network model can be found in <ref> [5] </ref>. 3 The leaky bucket model This section deals with a network where all connections are characterized by the leaky bucket model. Traffic on every connection is described through a pair of parameters (; ): a maximum burst of size is allowed over the maximum average rate . <p> Let us globally reshape traffic and bring the burstiness of each connection down to 0 where 0 0 (see Figure 1). According to <ref> [5] </ref>, the minimum end-to-end delay bound that can be guaranteed to connection C after the reshaping is given by: d c 1 k2S l k where d c is the minimum end-to-end delay bound before the reshaping; S is a set of links used by connection C; c is the maximum <p> To preserve the promised delay guarantees, it is necessary to ensure that for each connection C satisfying condition (2), the end-to-end delay bound d 0 c is not larger than the requested bound D c . According to <ref> [5] </ref>, the minimum value that may be selected for 0 equals to: 0 = door ( max c &lt; 1 P N k n 1 P N k o where door function is defined as follows: door (x) = x if x 0 and door (x) = 0 when x &lt; <p> Now, let different connections have different bursti-ness. Let us locally reshape traffic on connection C by reducing its burstiness from to 0 , where 0 0, while keeping the burstiness of the other connections unchanged. According to <ref> [5] </ref>, the the minimum end-to-end delay bound for connection C after the reshaping is equal to: d c 1 k2S l k Once again, the qualitative result of reshaping does not depend on the degree of reshaping. <p> Sometimes, an increase of the end-to-end delay bound is acceptable as far as the bound does not exceed the value D c requested by the user. Since reshaping improves performance guarantees for the rest of connections, such increase can be even desirable. According to <ref> [5] </ref>, if connection C is such that c &lt; 1 P k2S l k , then the minimum value that may be selected for 0 is: 0 = door ( D c k2S l k m=1 1 P 1 ): 4 The dual leaky bucket model When the constant bit rate

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Emerging multimedia applications, such as video-on-demand, require timely delivery of data over wide-area computer networks. Since even very small losses of transferred information can be unacceptable for such applications, deterministic guarantees of network behavior became a subject of intensive research <ref> [8] </ref>. Admission control employed to assure providing requested guarantees to all established connections is greatly affected by the model used to describe traffic. It has been shown that sending bursty data worsens resource utilization and weakens timeliness guarantees.

Reference-contexts: It indicates limited usefulness of the reshaping. This discouraging conclusion is not necessary true for other traffic models. Below we study an impact of reshaping when a multirate model is employed. A multirate specification was shown to be useful for efficient description of VBR data <ref> [9] </ref>. The corresponding shaping of traffic can be performed by a series of leaky buckets [1].
