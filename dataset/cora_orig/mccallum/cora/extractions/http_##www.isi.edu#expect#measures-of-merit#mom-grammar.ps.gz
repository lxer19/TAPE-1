Reference-contexts: INSPECT is a knowledge-based system developed using ISI's EXPECT framework. The system checks the consistency of air campaign plans with respect to several criteria. INSPECT provides consistency checking for operational plans developed (or modified) using ACPT. For a detailed description of INSPECT, see <ref> [Valente et al., 1996a] </ref>. The term measure of effect should not be confused with measure of effectiveness. The former, is a synonym for measure of merit, something that defines when an objective has been achieved | that is, how to measure the effect of an objective/task.
Reference: [Valente et al., 1996b] <author> A. Valente, W. Swartout, and Y. Gil. </author> <title> A representation and library for objectives in air campaign plans. </title> <type> Technical report, </type> <institution> USC Information Sciences Institute, </institution> <year> 1996. </year>
Reference-contexts: The representation proposed in this document is a continuation of work in the representation of objectives in air campaign plans, initially documented in <ref> [Valente et al., 1996b] </ref>. The basic idea is to provide a richer and more structured representation for air campaign plan objectives than the one currently used. <p> Further, it assumes knowledge of the representation for ACP objectives proposed in <ref> [Valente et al., 1996b] </ref>. This document is structured as follows. In Section 2 we briefly describe the background and rationale for the proposed representation. In Section 3 we present the representation, and show how a number of examples of MOEs would be expressed using it.
