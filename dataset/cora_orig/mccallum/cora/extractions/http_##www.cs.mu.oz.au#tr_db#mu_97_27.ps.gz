Reference-contexts: Further, the outsourcing vendors' performance, expertise, cost, and quality need to be continuously benchmarked against competitors. These benchmark measures need to be agreed on and reflected in the contract. Configuration management deals with the tracking and control of changes to evolving components <ref> [14, 1] </ref>. From the project management perspective, proper configuration management allows the current status of components to be determined and used to coordinate the project planning and implementation activities [1]. <p> Configuration management deals with the tracking and control of changes to evolving components [14, 1]. From the project management perspective, proper configuration management allows the current status of components to be determined and used to coordinate the project planning and implementation activities <ref> [1] </ref>. From the technical perspective, configuration management allows us to control and coordinate changes, determine the impact of those changes and propagate those changes to the required items. In an outsourcing situation, configuration items will have to be shared between the outsourcer and the outsourcing vendor.

Reference-contexts: This along with the known risks of any software development project makes recognising risk and managing risk more important. Further, well known process models which take project risk into account, for example Boehm's Spiral <ref> [2] </ref> model, may not be suitable in a multi-vendor situation. Procedures for managing risk in the context of numerous stakeholders, such as the SEI's Team Risk management procedures, may take on greater importance. 15 4.3 The Outsourcing Decision Outsourcing offers organisations new opportunities as well as new challenges.

Reference-contexts: For example, software development for specialised requirements, such as security or safety, requires special processes to be followed and specialised analyses to be undertaken <ref> [3, 6] </ref>. New or emerging technologies are the third facet of outsourcing. To be competitive, organisations often need to embrace a wide variety of technologies.

Reference-contexts: Outsourcing also helps organisations to improve focus, capitalise on global opportunities and free up in-house resources for more strategic tasks. Further, outsourcing provides a means of keeping pace with changes in the IT industry without the overhead of constantly training staff for new technologies <ref> [4] </ref>. Another less obvious, yet equally important, benefit of outsourcing is in breaking away from an organisation's paradigm, which includes its processes, technology and personnel.

We define software outsourcing as contracting out the development, planning, management, training, maintenance, or operation of software services, skills, products, or applications. <p> Further, these tasks (common, specialised, or control) may fall into or outside the core competencies 6 of the organisation. Core competencies are critical activities, skill services, and knowledge bases that create continuous added value and competitive advantage to the organisation and distinguish it from its competitors <ref> [5] </ref>. The case studies in [5, 11, 15, 22] seem to indicate that organisations are outsourcing mainly common tasks and some specialised tasks that are not part of their core strategic competencies. <p> Core competencies are critical activities, skill services, and knowledge bases that create continuous added value and competitive advantage to the organisation and distinguish it from its competitors [5].

Reference-contexts: However, it is becoming a multi-billion dollar global industry, and a sizeable proportion of all IT resources are spent on outsourcing. According to a U.S. International Trade Commission report, the global outsourcing market is expected to reach $99 billion in revenues by 1998 <ref> [9] </ref>. As a result, vendors that specialise in outsourcing services or outsourcing management are growing and global and large-scale outsourcing is becoming more prevalent. Organisations are engaging in outsourcing in an attempt to meet market demands.

We define software outsourcing as contracting out the development, planning, management, training, maintenance, or operation of software services, skills, products, or applications. <p> Organisations are engaging in outsourcing in an attempt to meet market demands. More organisations are using new but not necessarily home grown tools, making alliances and using external expertise to help keep up with the development demands <ref> [13, 23] </ref>. With outsourcing, organisations aim to improve qualities of software products and services, speed delivery times, and reduce costs. This is achieved through improving company focus, gaining access to the needed expertise, sharing risks and costs, and re-using products and experiences. <p> Software development tasks can be relocated to another country for their advanced technological expertise or for a reduction in cost over local competitors. Indeed, software programming can, and has, been outsourced to third world countries for a fraction of the cost of developing the product locally <ref> [13] </ref>. 2.2 Specialisation and Software Outsourcing Many organisations are now turning to outsourcing to help them cut costs, improve services, and focus on their core business activities [13]. This helps organisations concentrate on what they are good at|their core business| and leave the rest to somebody else. <p> Indeed, software programming can, and has, been outsourced to third world countries for a fraction of the cost of developing the product locally <ref> [13] </ref>. 2.2 Specialisation and Software Outsourcing Many organisations are now turning to outsourcing to help them cut costs, improve services, and focus on their core business activities [13].

As the IT world is changing so fast and growing increasingly more complex, specialisation is becoming vital. <p> Managing and coordinating outsourcing vendors Many risks in software development are associated with the diversity of the participants and activities within the software life-cycle. The impact of outsourcing on these risks can be variable <ref> [13] </ref>. <p> Outsourcing involves both business risk and project management risk. Some of the business risks include the following. * Establishing and maintaining the relationships required for successful outsourcing can be complex and resource intensive <ref> [13] </ref>. * losing control over key aspects of the system can cause the outsourcer to become strategically dependent on the outsourcing vendor. * There are substantial impediments to withdrawing from the outsourc ing decision, once it has been made and implemented.

Reference-contexts: Further, outsourcing in software development is a growing area. The problem is that the fear of giving too great a monopoly to the supplier with too few ways of measuring value for money is still preventing some organisations from making full use of outsourcing <ref> [15] </ref>. There is a need to analyse the issues that arise with software development outsourcing and to establish frameworks and models which allow the organisations to outsource aspects of their software development without losing control. <p> Core competencies are critical activities, skill services, and knowledge bases that create continuous added value and competitive advantage to the organisation and distinguish it from its competitors [5].

Reference-contexts: Outsourcing vendor: The contractor or external provider delivering the outsourcing service to the outsourcer. Collaborative software development: Use of both in-house and contracted services to accomplish a software development task. This type of col laborative outsourcing is also known as alliance outsourcing <ref> [16] </ref>. 1.2 Facets of Software Outsourcing Software outsourcing has many facets, but the three main ones that concern us here are People, Technology and Process as represented in Figure 1. <p> When they find a good solution, they use it repeatedly with different customers. IT firms have been pioneers in developing partnered relationships and focused strategies, for example, Sun Microsystems focuses internal operations on small set of critical core activities and outsource nearly everything else in its value chain <ref> [16] </ref>. Alcatel has decided to buy-in Digital's computer technology, rather than developing its own. The aim is to allow the company to concentrate on its existing expertise in high-availability telecommunications software [10]. 2.3 Key Benefits Of Outsourcing Initially, outsourcing was used as a means for cutting costs. <p> In order for the outsourcer to exercise a level of control over the development of the outsourced components, then bonding, monitoring and benchmarking need to be continuously practiced. <ref> [16] </ref>. Bonding, in the context of project management, refers to efforts of: * establishing the relationship with the outsourcing vendor; * defining the communication and control channels; * structuring the internal personnel to oversee the outsourcing work; * making the ongoing adjustments in the outsourcing relationship. <p> Monitoring efforts, in the context of ongoing project management, is directed towards verifying the process controls and ensuring standard practices across the board <ref> [16] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The demand to produce new or specialised software for specialised markets, business, government or domestic use is ever increasing. For example the telecommunications industry, which was founded on electro-mechanical genius, now places more than 80% of the value of a switch in its software <ref> [20] </ref>. In addition, the demand for new telecommunications services, primarily based on software, or supported or customised by software, is increasing and growing more vital. However, as the scale and complexity of the marketplace continues to grow, many of the opportunities are turning into threats.
