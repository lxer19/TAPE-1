Abstract: The level-1 calorimeter trigger system for the CMS detector at LHC collider must provide a deadtimeless, pipelined trigger that implements simple algorithms which satisfy the physics efficiency and data rate requirements. In this note we examine the performance of a conceptual design and that of an alternate algorithm for the electron trigger. The algorithms account for energy sharing between neighboring towers and perform hadronic, and optionally, electromagnetic isolation. Through extensive simulation of the level-1 calorimeter trigger, we have determined the background rates and efficiencies for various triggers such as those for electrons, photons, jets and neutrinos.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction We present here simulation results of a conceptual design <ref> [1] </ref> of a level-1 calorimeter trigger system for the CMS detector [2]. For the nominal LHC design luminosity of 10 34 cm 2 s 1 , several tens of events occur at the beam crossing frequency of 40 MHz. <p> In order to implement this "sliding window" algorithm, data is required from one ring of the nearest neighbor towers for each reference tower. This requires that data be shared across trigger cards as well as crates <ref> [1] </ref>. However, only lower 2 bits of neighboring HCAL tower information is sufficient because the HCAL neighbor tower information is only used to place a tight cut ( 2 GeV). <p> After establishing requirements for the performance of the trigger system [5, 6] which fulfill the physics goals of the CMS experiment, we have produced a conceptual design <ref> [1] </ref> of the level-1 calorimeter regional trigger system based on the "sliding window" algorithm. The input data to the regional trigger processor consists of ECAL and HCAL transverse energies arranged in 72 fi 54 trigger towers of size 0:087 fi 0:087 each.

Reference-contexts: All these limitations have been determined to cause only negligible degradation of the performance of the trigger. In the following results for the "sliding window" trigger we use these limited transverse energy scales. An alternate proposal for the electron/photon trigger, called the "peak finding" algorithm <ref> [3, 4] </ref>, adapted to the trigger tower geometry as described below, is also simulated. This algorithm considers rectangular trigger towers in a region shown in Figure 2 at a time. <p> We have simulated the peak finding algorithm, including the details of cluster codes and overlap detection as described in <ref> [3] </ref>, and obtained the electron/photon trigger the QCD background rate and efficiency for detecting single electrons with minimum bias background.

The boundaries of HCAL trigger towers line up with boundaries of the ECAL trigger towers in and for both the trigger schemes. 6 4 Level 1 Calorimeter Trigger Design The level 1 calorimeter trigger system (See Figure 3) consists of regional and global processors.

Reference-contexts: The regional system begins after the data from the front end electronics is received on optical fibers and translated to signals on copper and ends with cables that transmit the results to the calorimeter global level 1 trigger system.

Reference-contexts: The longitudinal distribution of electron and photon showers is parametrized as a gamma distribution, as in the particle data group <ref> [7] </ref>. Shower parameters were obtained from full GEANT simulation (See Figure 4) of electron showers in the PbWO 4 crystals. The longitudinal distribution is fluctuated by a scale factor 7 8 GEANT simulation.

Reference-contexts: All other charged particles, i.e., pions and kaons, are tracked similarly to the muons until they interact according to the hadronic interaction probability. The energy of the hadrons is then smeared with the expected detector resolution of E = :8 p E + :03E. A parameterization <ref> [8] </ref>, with separate gamma distribution shape for electromagnetic and hadronic components of the hadron shower, is used to calculate the energy deposits of the hadrons in 30 cm steps (in the HCAL) along the direction of the shower. <p> Although more accurate 10 parameters can be obtained by fully simulating large number of hadron showers using a pro-gram such as GEANT/GHIESHA, we simply used the parameters given in <ref> [8] </ref>. Because this parameterization is in terms of the properties of the medium such as radiation and interaction lengths we assume that it scales suitably to the CMS Cu-Scintillatior calorimeter.

Reference-contexts: To simulate the transverse development of the shower, at each 30 cm step three deposits of energy are distributed transversely with a double exponential distribution <ref> [9] </ref>. The parameters in that distribution are scaled to reflect the difference in interaction lengths in the different media. These subdivided deposits of energy at each step are again stored as calorimeter hits. The calorimeter hits are finally summed to provide total energy in each calorimeter tower.
