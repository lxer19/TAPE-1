Abstract: Most existing approaches to computer aided process planning aim for full automation by searching for a plan that is optimal with respect to a pre-specified objective function. Such full automation is often infeasible in practice for three reasons: (i) the search space of potential plans is huge, (ii) optimality metrics are often context sensitive and can only be elicited through user interaction, (iii) because of the importance of process planning, organizations are more interested in process planning assistants that support human expert process planners rather than standalone process planners. In this paper, we present a "process planner's assistant", which helps the human process planning experts in coming up with process plans. In order to achieve this, the process planner's assistant must have access to the full search space of process plans, and the ability to modify plans in response to human criticism. The former is provided by basing our system on ASU Features Testbed, a comprehensive and systematic framework for recognizing and reasoning with features in machinable parts. To support the latter, the system is equipped with an incremental and interactive search mechanism. We will discuss the operational details of the resultant system, called ASUPPA.

Reference-contexts: It also depends on the number of feature types classified based on shapes and tolerance specifications. Using the method described by Das, Gupta and Nau <ref> (Das,1994) </ref>, the minimum number of setups can be estimated and the plan whose number of setups are less than that number will be pruned immediately because of its impossibility.

Reference-contexts: Another difference between ASUPPA and the Nextcut process planning system is that ASUPPA is based on a more systematic feature interpretation framework. ASUPPA is also closely related to the IMACS system <ref> (Gupta,1994) </ref>. The primary difference is that while IMACS is intended to be a stand-alone process planner, ASUPPA is designed to be a process planner's assistant.
