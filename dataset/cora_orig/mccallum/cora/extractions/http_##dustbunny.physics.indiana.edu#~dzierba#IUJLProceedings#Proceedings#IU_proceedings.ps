Recently Buras and Buchalla <ref> [2] </ref> note that: . . . since the charm sector [contribution to the rate] does not matter for the CP -violating mode K L ! 0 - -, the standard model prediction in this case is extremely accurate after the inclusion of QCD corrections. <p> Note that only the imaginary part of V td survives in the amplitude because of the coherent superposition of K 0 and K 0 in the K L . The long distance corrections to the rate are accounted for by normalizing to the known semileptonic K-decay rate. Ref. <ref> [2] </ref> contains a calculation beyond leading logarithms (using an O (ff s ) calculation for the top quark contribution) and indicates that the theoretical uncertainties are no greater than 7% for typical SM parameters.

Reference-contexts: The two-body K 2 background can then be identified by the unique momentum of the 0 when viewed in the K L rest frame. If the K L momentum is known from time-of-flight, then a large fraction of the phase space can be available for detection <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. Fig. 2 shows the reconstructed momentum in the K L center-of-mass frame (p fl ) for both signal and background (K 2 ) from a Monte Carlo simulation where the resolution in the measured quantities were set to the nominal values given in Table 1.

The estimate of position resolution is based on studies done for RHIC at TRIUMF. The background estimates listed in Table 3 indicate that the signal-to-noise will be greater than 10 for each of the K L ! 0 0 backgrounds.
