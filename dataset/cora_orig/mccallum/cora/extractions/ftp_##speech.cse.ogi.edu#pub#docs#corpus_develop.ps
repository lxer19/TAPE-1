Abstract: This paper describes eight telephone-speech corpora at various stages of development at the Center for Spoken Language Understanding. For each corpus, we describe data collection procedures, methods of soliciting callers, protocol used to collect the data, transcriptions that accompany the speech data, and the expected release date. The corpora are available at no charge to academic institutions.

Reference-contexts: Time-aligned phonetic transcription involves aligning phonetic symbols to the acoustic signal. A precise description of the conventions used for all levels of labeling, including a complete list of all phonetic labels for each language, is presented in the CSLU conventions document <ref> [1] </ref> Transcription Reliability. We are conducting experiments to determine the level of agreement among labelers. In these experiments, CSLU staff and professional phoneticians are using Worldbet [5] to transcribe the same intervals of speech. <p> For the broad phonetic transcription, we have adopted the World-bet labeling scheme, a set of orthographic symbols for multi-language transcription that correspond to IPA symbols [5]. The rationale for using Worldbet and the inventory of symbols for each language is provided in <ref> [1] </ref>. 2.3. Stories Corpus Collection for the OGI Multi-Language Corpus produced additional calls from English speakers not included in the Multi-Language Corpus. The Stories Corpus consists of up to 50 sec of spontaneous speech (hereafter "stories") from 692 English calls.

Reference-contexts: Initial results for English indicate overall agreement of approximately 80% across all labels, ranging from approximately 70% for vowels to greater than 90% for stops and nasals. Speech Tools. The OGI Speech Tools support data manipulation, analysis and display <ref> [2] </ref>. All corpus development activities are performed using these tools. They were developed at CSLU, then made portable and documented for distribution with support from NSF. The tools have been made available to the research community through anonymous ftp. 2.

Reference-contexts: All data are stored in the NIST wav file format, some with MIT shortpack compression. The remaining corpora are under development and estimated release dates are provided for each. 2.1. Spelled and Spoken Names Corpus The Spelled and Spoken Names Corpus <ref> [3] </ref> contains utterances from 3667 calls. Callers were solicited through computer newsgroups and a public relations campaign initiated by OGI. The majority of callers were from the Pacific Northwest. The proportion of male to female callers is 1.15 : 1.

Reference-contexts: The subsets of phonetically labeled utterances available to date are as follows: Type Number alphabet 100 hometown 1359 callfrom 693 say first name 100 say last name 101 spell last name with pause 300 2.2. Enhanced OGI Multi-Language Cor pus The OGI Multi-Language Telephone-Speech Corpus <ref> [4] </ref> consists of telephone-speech from 10 languages: English, Farsi, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin, Spanish, Tamil and Vietnamese. The initial corpus included 900 calls|90 calls for each language. Callers were solicited through computer newsgroups.
