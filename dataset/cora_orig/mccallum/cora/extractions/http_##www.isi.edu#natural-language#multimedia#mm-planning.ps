Abstract: During the planning of multimedia presentations, at least two distinct processes are required: planning the underlying discourse structure (that is, ordering and interrelating the information to be presented) and allocating the media (that is, delimiting the portions to be displayed by each individual medium). The former process has been the topic of several studies in the area of text planning, but numerous questions remain for the latter, including: What is the nature of the allocation process | what does it start with and what does it produce? What information does it depend on? How should the two processes be performed | sequentially, interleaved, or simultaneously? In this paper, we define Discourse Structure and Presentation Structure and outline the kinds of information that media allocation rules must depend on, including, centrally, information about the discourse structure. We describe a prototype planning system that performs the information-to-media allocation, arguing that since media allocation rules depend on the characteristics of the information to be presented, they can only be applied once the overall discourse structure has been essentially planned out and the individual portions of information have become apparent. This paper appears in the Proceedings of the International Joint Conference of Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-93), Chambery, France, 1993.

Reference-contexts: In the simplest, most direct approach to multimedia presentation planning, the question of clustering and allocating information to appropriate media is handled simply by fixed rules that specify exactly what medium is to be used for each particular data type, as in the following rule from the Integrated Interfaces system <ref> [2] </ref>: 1. Ships' locations are presented on maps. For generality, portability, and flexibility, this is clearly not a satisfactory solution. For this reason, most approaches generalize this type of rule by using features, instead of data types and media, in both sides of the rule. One possible generalization is: 1'.

Reference-contexts: As a result of our reading, and after analysis of multimedia aspects in business reports, instruction manuals, cookbooks, etc., we have identified and taxonomized four distinct collections of information features that play a role in the design of multimedia presentations <ref> [38, 18, 17, 3] </ref>. These four classes of information are: characteristics of the information to be conveyed, characteristics of the media at hand, the presenter's goals, and the perceiver's interests and abilities.

Reference-contexts: These four classes of information are: characteristics of the information to be conveyed, characteristics of the media at hand, the presenter's goals, and the perceiver's interests and abilities. In <ref> [4] </ref> we describe a feature-based formalism for this information, organized in an And-Or dependency network, and provide some examples of presentation rules based on these features. Some example features appear in the prototype system rules below. <p> rules governing presentations operate cross-modally; that is, the same rule can be used to control the analysis or generation of some aspect of both a diagram and a piece of text, when the right representation formalism is employed, resulting in a reduction of the complexity and number of rules (see <ref> [4] </ref>). Computational attempts to plan multimedia presentations make clear that describing the information to be presented, the goals of the presenter, and the nature of the media and interlocutor merely as lists of features is too restrictive and simple to permit realistic displays to be created. <p> Our prototype system applies the rules to an existing predefined discourse structure and then creates a multimedia presentation of the information using graphs, bar charts, pie charts, and text. We further discuss the nature of the rules and describe how they encapsulate the information we outlined in <ref> [4] </ref> and [37]. This prototype media allocation planner operates over a collection of data regarding the sales of cheese in Switzerland during 1986, taken from an annual banking report. An English paraphrase of some of the system's data appears in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: Our prototype system applies the rules to an existing predefined discourse structure and then creates a multimedia presentation of the information using graphs, bar charts, pie charts, and text. We further discuss the nature of the rules and describe how they encapsulate the information we outlined in [4] and <ref> [37] </ref>. This prototype media allocation planner operates over a collection of data regarding the sales of cheese in Switzerland during 1986, taken from an annual banking report. An English paraphrase of some of the system's data appears in Figure 2.

Reference-contexts: As a result of our reading, and after analysis of multimedia aspects in business reports, instruction manuals, cookbooks, etc., we have identified and taxonomized four distinct collections of information features that play a role in the design of multimedia presentations <ref> [38, 18, 17, 3] </ref>. These four classes of information are: characteristics of the information to be conveyed, characteristics of the media at hand, the presenter's goals, and the perceiver's interests and abilities.
