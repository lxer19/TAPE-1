Abstract: In this paper, we develop a QoS-aware traffic shaper, which is implemented in LRMP (Local Resource Management Protocol) of the VGAnet Suite. In contrast to the conventional traffic shapers, e.g., leaky buckets and token buckets, which simply shape the average rate (and burst) of data transmission without any knowledge of the QoS parameters, e.g., delay jitter and synchronization skew, the QoS-aware traffic shaper cooperating with the connection management and data transfer protocols provides a service for delivering the continuous-media streams with the bandwidth guarantee, jitter control, and skew control on top of the 100VG-Any LAN.

We experimented with H.263 video streams and will compare the performances using two protocol stacks: UDP/IP and VGAnet Suite.
