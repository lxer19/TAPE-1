Abstract: Given a set of objects in the visual field, how does the the visual system learn to attend to a particular object of interest while ignoring the rest? How are occlusions and background clutter so effortlessly discounted for when recognizing a familiar object? In this paper, we attempt to answer these questions in the context of a Kalman filter-based model of visual recognition that has previously been useful in explaining certain neurophysiological phenomena such as endstopping and related extra-classical receptive field effects in the visual cortex. By using results from the field of robust statistics, we describe an extension of the Kalman filter model that can handle multiple objects in the visual field. The resulting robust Kalman filter model demonstrates how certain forms of attention can be viewed as an emergent property of the interaction between top-down expectations and bottom-up signals. The model also suggests functional interpretations of certain attention-related effects that have been observed in visual cortical neurons. Experimental results are provided to help demonstrate the ability of the model to perform robust segmentation and recognition of objects and image sequences in the presence of varying degrees of occlusions and clutter.

Reference-contexts: In order to specify how the internal state r changes with time, the Kalman filter assumes that the process of interest can be modeled as a Gauss-Markov random process <ref> [1] </ref>. <p> It is easy to show <ref> [1] </ref> that J is simply the sum of the negative log-likelihood of generating the data I given the state r, and the negative log of the prior probability of the state r. <p> In the case of dynamic stimuli, the EM algorithm prescribes r (t) = b r (tjN ), which is the optimal temporally smoothed state estimate <ref> [1] </ref> for time t ( N ), given input data for each of the time instants 1; : : : ; N . Unfortunately, the smoothed estimate requires knowledge of future inputs and is computationally quite expensive.

Reference-contexts: The modulation in responses was mediated by the non-linear gating neurons G, taking into account both bottom-up signals as well top-down feedback signals. This suggests a network-level interpretation of similar forms of attentional response modulation in the primate visual cortex <ref> [2, 8, 14] </ref>, with the consequent prediction that the genesis of attentional modulation in such cases may not necessarily lie within the recorded neurons themselves but within the distributed circuitry that these neurons are an integral part of.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION The human visual system possesses the remarkable ability to recognize objects despite the presence of distractors and occluders in the field of view. A popular suggestion is that an attentional spotlight mediates this ability to preferentially process a relevant object in a given scene (see <ref> [5, 9] </ref> for reviews). Numerous models have been proposed to simulate the control of this focus of attention [10, 11, 15]. Unfortunately, there is inconclusive evidence for the existence of an explicit neural mechanism for implementing an attentional spotlight in the visual cortex.

Reference-contexts: A common choice is to use a constant matrix or even a constant scalar. Making constant however reduces the Kalman filter estimates to standard least-squares estimates, which are highly susceptible to outliers or gross errors i.e. data points that lie far away from the bulk of the observed data <ref> [6] </ref>. For example, in the case where I represents an input image, occlusions and clutter will cause many pixels in I to deviate significantly from corresponding pixels in the predicted image U r. The problem of outliers can be tackled using robust estimation procedures [6] such as M-estimation, which involves minimizing <p> the bulk of the observed data <ref> [6] </ref>. For example, in the case where I represents an input image, occlusions and clutter will cause many pixels in I to deviate significantly from corresponding pixels in the predicted image U r. The problem of outliers can be tackled using robust estimation procedures [6] such as M-estimation, which involves minimizing a function of the form: J 0 = i=1 is a non-linear function of the current residual error between the input I and its top-down prediction U r.
