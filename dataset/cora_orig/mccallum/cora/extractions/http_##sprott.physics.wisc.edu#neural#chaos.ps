Abstract: In this paper we report the result of a Monte Carlo study on the probability of chaos in large dynamical systems. We use neural networks as the basis functions for the system dynamics and choose parameter values for the networks randomly. Our results show that as the dimension of the system and the complexity of the network increase, the probability of chaotic dynamics increases to 100%. Since neural networks are dense in the set of dynamical systems, our conclusion is that most large systems are chaotic.
