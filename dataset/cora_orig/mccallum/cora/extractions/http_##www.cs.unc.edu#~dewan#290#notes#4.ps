Abstract: Collaborative applications interact with multiple users, possibly geographically dispersed, and allow them to share information in potentially real-time. In the future, it is quiet likely that all computer applications addressing complex problems will allow users to closely collaborate with each other to solve these problems. This tutorial will address the design and implementation of collaborative applications. The target audience is researchers interested in learning about issues raised by collaborative applications that they are unfamiliar with and practitioners interested in the state-of-the-art techniques for building groupware products. The tutorial will assume that the audience are software developers but will make no assumptions about their familiarity with the field of CSCW. Thus it will be accessible to ``beginners'' in this field. At the end of the tutorial, the audience will be able to understand the motivation for collaborative applications, summarize important parts of the collaboration design space, and identify and compare collaborative architectures and tools. The tutorial will first address the design of these applications. Specific examples will be given to illustrate the nature, scope, and usefulness of these applications. The design space of these applications will be characterised using the dimensions of conference management, coupling, access control, concurrency control, merging, user awareness, and undo/redo. Videos will be shown to illustrate parts of the design space. Several architectures have been proposed for distributing the components of groupware applications including the centralized, replicated, and hybrid architectures. Moreover, a variety of tools can be used to to automate their implementation including database systems, programming abstractions such as the Colab object abstractions, shared window systems such as Rapport and XTV, group toolkits such as MMConf and GroupKit, messages buses such as CB and Field, communication tools such as distributed object systems and ISIS, and multiuser user interface management systems such as Rendezvous and Suite. The second part of this tutorial will identify, explain, and compare these architectures and tools. It will use the example of a multiuser software-testing application to illustrate and compare different techniques for implementing a collaborative application. Prasun Dewan is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill. His research interests include system support for distributed collaboration, distributed object-oriented database management systems, system support for user interfaces, and software development environments. He is currently building an infrastructure, called Suite, for supporting both synchronous and asynchronous collaborative applications. He has participated in program committees of ACM/IEEE conferences on computer supportive cooperative work, multimedia, user interfaces, distributed computing, and software engineering; guest edited journal issues on user interface software and collaborative systems; and given t utorials for NTU (National Technological University) the IEEE Data Engineering Conference, and the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work. He is an Associate Editor of ACM Transactions on Information Systems and a member of the IFIP WG2.7 group on Engineering for Human Computer Interaction
