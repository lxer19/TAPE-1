Abstract: An image-guided ultrasonic phased array system for non-invasive tissue ablation is described. Image guidance is provided by processing beamformed RF-data from a commercially available scanner. Two dimensional estimates of tissue temperature are obtained in real-time by implementing a high-speed displacement tracking algorithm. Experimental results validate our approach for image guidance in which the therapy array is initially driven at low (non-destructive) intensity sufficient to cause a small change in temperature at the focus. Two-dimensional non-invasive temperature data is then used to localize and assess the quality of the focus. If the extent and location of the focal spot are consistent with expected values, a high-intensity pulse capable of causing tissue ablation is delivered. Preliminary in-vitro beef muscle experiments are reported, showing successful visualization of the location and quality of the HIFU focus followed by an ablative pulse. Dissection revealed lesion formation (2mm dia., 12mm long, 30mm deep within the tissue) at the expected location.

Reference-contexts: It has long been recognized that the lack of a non-invasive two-dimensional temperature feedback is a major hindrance against the use of HIFU for a range of deeply localized thermotherapies. Recent results from a number of research groups have suggested the use of MRI <ref> [1] </ref>, impedance tomography [2], and microwave radiometry [3] for non-invasive temperature estimation. Our group has investigated the use of backscattered ultrasound for this purpose [4]. We have recently developed a high speed method for temperature estimation based on displacement tracking of ultrasonic echo data from the heated region.

Reference-contexts: Using low power, the HIFU transducer was driven with a double focus pattern, computed using the synthesis method described in <ref> [7] </ref>. At the beginning, the foci were located 30 mm apart. The distance between the two foci was gradually decreased until they combined into a single focus at the geometric center of the transducer.

Reference-contexts: The transducer currently being used in the HIFU system has a wide enough bandwidth to provide reasonable resolution for the temperature estimation algorithm.
