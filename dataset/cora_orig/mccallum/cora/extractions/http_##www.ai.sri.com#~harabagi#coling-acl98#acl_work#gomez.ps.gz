Reference-contexts: Role entailments are shared by subpredicates of a generic predicate not across generic predicates. Our approach also differs from those analyses that attempt to reduce the verb semantic analysis to a small set of notions e.g., Jackendoff'localist hypothesis (Jackendoff, 1990), Dowty-Vendler's aspectual hypothesis (Vendler, 1967), Dowty <ref> (Dowty, 1979) </ref>, or to a small set of primitives (Schank, 1975). Our major critique to reductionist analyses are Quinean (Quine, 1960) in nature, namely meaning is holistic. Trying to reduce verb meaning to a small set of notions is going to fail because verb meaning is inter-sentential.

Reference-contexts: Because the NP "11,000 miles" is not a subcategorized argument of "fly," why call it a "role" and not an "adjunct"? From a semantic point of view, it makes no difference whether one calls it "adjunct" or "the matic role." Dowty <ref> (Dowty, 1991) </ref>, then, asks that, if one assigns a thematic role to measures of distance, why not assign a role to "quickly" in "She walks quickly." Our answer is that we should assign a role to "quickly." But, that role, whatever its name, should not be placed in the predicate change-of-location <p> This approach does not lead to a propagation of roles since their number and nature depend on the generic predicate and its subpredicates. The critique of "role fragmentation the subdivision of a single role into many subroles as result of subsequent analysis <ref> (Dowty, 1991) </ref> is valid if the entailments are based exclusively on the role, but not if they are anchored on the role and the predicate. The roles that we have used throughout our analysis have differences in meaning across diverse generic predicates, or verb classes. <p> For instance, the meaning of the role theme in a change of state verb, say "break," is different from its meaning in a transfer of information verb, say "tell." Hence, if the entailments are based only on the role, one would be compelled to recognize several types of theme <ref> (Dowty, 1991) </ref>, but because the entailments are based on the predicate and on the role, this is not necessary. Role entailments are shared by subpredicates of a generic predicate not across generic predicates.

Reference-contexts: See (Gomez, 1996) for a discussion. Our work differs from the semantic role list approaches <ref> (Fillmore, 1968) </ref> in several essential aspects. First of all in our method, the semantic roles are not defined independently of the meaning of the verb and are not semantically unanalyzable.

Reference-contexts: The semantic interpreter algorithm, which is an extension of the one reported in <ref> (Gomez et al., 1997) </ref>, is based on the idea that the meaning of the verb depends not only on its selectional restrictions, but also on the syntactic relations that realize them. A similar view has been presented in (Pustejovsky, 1995). Semantic interpretation is delayed until the end of a clause.

Reference-contexts: The thematic roles of the predicates are connected to Word-Net ontology for nouns and to the syntactic relations that realize them. Our approach to building verb meaning is based on the decomposition of a predicate into subpredicates. Subpredicates inherit not only thematic roles, but also inferences as explained in <ref> (Gomez, 1996) </ref>. Inferences will be defined for generic predicates and subpredicates subsuming a large class of verb forms. The final product will be a network of predicates linked by subsumption, and inferences, and connected to the WordNet ontology for nouns and to grammatical relations. <p> See <ref> (Gomez, 1996) </ref> for a discussion. Our work differs from the semantic role list approaches (Fillmore, 1968) in several essential aspects. First of all in our method, the semantic roles are not defined independently of the meaning of the verb and are not semantically unanalyzable.

Reference-contexts: We plan to publish a complete listing of all our predicates and sub-predicates for all WordNet verb classes, once they have been fully tested. In <ref> (Gomez, 1998) </ref>, the reader can find a detailed description and evaluation of the semantic interpreter algorithm that uses the lexical entries defined here. This paper complements (Gomez, 1998) in which, for space reasons, only one predicate could be analyzed. <p> In <ref> (Gomez, 1998) </ref>, the reader can find a detailed description and evaluation of the semantic interpreter algorithm that uses the lexical entries defined here. This paper complements (Gomez, 1998) in which, for space reasons, only one predicate could be analyzed. The hierarchical decomposition of predicates plays a central role in our methodology. A generic predicate subsumes all its subpredicates in a similar way in which the generic concept "book" subsumes all its subconcepts. <p> The WordNet ontology for nouns also has been reorganized and redefined in some respects in order to conform with the entries in the thematic roles of the predicates. (See <ref> (Gomez, 1998) </ref> for some details.) Two major consequences derive from anchoring verb classes in abstract semantic predicates: coalescing several WordNet synsets into a predicate, and mapping the same WordNet synset into distinct predicates. <p> Thus, subj refers to the subject of a sentence without expressing any context about the transitivity or intransitivity of the verb. 3 Verbs in which the agent causes a change of location of something else In <ref> (Gomez, 1998) </ref>, we provide an analysis of verbs in which an animate agent changes location. We start explaining the predicate cause-to-change-location depicted on top of the next column. <p> We have recognized that semantic relation by creating the role distance meaning the distance traveled by an animate agent in a change-of-location predicate <ref> (Gomez, 1998) </ref>. The inference is based on that role and on that predicate.

Reference-contexts: First, its goal is not expressed with the preposition "to," e.g., *Mary placed/arranged/put/etc the books to the table. Second, the source is not realized by any syntactic relation <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>. That is why the source entry is nil for the selectional restriction and the syntactic relation in order to indicate that this predicate does not inherit a goal from its ancestors. <p> A subclass of throw1 is formed by those verbs that Levin <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref> calls "pelt" verbs ("buffet," "bombard," "pelt," "shower," "stone") in which the goal is realized by obj and the theme by a "with" phrase, e.g., "Beth pelted Chris with snowballs." Of these, WordNet does not include "shower" and "stone" as forms under pelt1. <p> The primary event of this subclass is not a cause-to-change-location, although one may be implied. Some of these forms can be used in the causative/inchoative alternation, e.g., "The cream separated from the milk," and in the middle alternation, e.g., "Cream separates easily from milk" <ref> (Levin, 1993) </ref>. Separate2 is analyzed as a subpred-icate of cause-a-change-of-state, and coalesced with some other synsets of "separate" which are classified by WordNet as subclasses of change1, cause a change of state.

Reference-contexts: A similar view has been presented in <ref> (Pustejovsky, 1995) </ref>. Semantic interpretation is delayed until the end of a clause. For every verb in a clause, WordNet provides a list of verb synsets for which we have defined predicates. These predicates are contenders for the meaning of the verb.

Reference-contexts: of entailment is "if Peter killed the roach, the roach is dead." An example of non-monotonic inference is "if Peter likes apples, he eats them." Of course, it is very important to bear in mind that the difference between non-monotonic inferences and entailments is a question of degrees as Quine <ref> (Quine, 1953) </ref> has argued convincely. See (Gomez, 1996) for a discussion. Our work differs from the semantic role list approaches (Fillmore, 1968) in several essential aspects. First of all in our method, the semantic roles are not defined independently of the meaning of the verb and are not semantically unanalyzable.

Reference-contexts: As of this writing we have defined predicates for 70% of WordNet verb forms. We are using the term "inference" to refer to both entailments and non-monotonic inferences, also called defeasible inferences. The term "entailment" is used in the sense of analytic implication <ref> (Quine, 1960) </ref>. A sentence, say s1, entails sentence s2 if s2 is true in every world in which s1 is true. <p> Our major critique to reductionist analyses are Quinean <ref> (Quine, 1960) </ref> in nature, namely meaning is holistic. Trying to reduce verb meaning to a small set of notions is going to fail because verb meaning is inter-sentential. One may take some verbs whose meaning can be reduced to some few principles, or notions.

Reference-contexts: Our approach also differs from those analyses that attempt to reduce the verb semantic analysis to a small set of notions e.g., Jackendoff'localist hypothesis (Jackendoff, 1990), Dowty-Vendler's aspectual hypothesis (Vendler, 1967), Dowty (Dowty, 1979), or to a small set of primitives <ref> (Schank, 1975) </ref>. Our major critique to reductionist analyses are Quinean (Quine, 1960) in nature, namely meaning is holistic. Trying to reduce verb meaning to a small set of notions is going to fail because verb meaning is inter-sentential. <p> But, if you consider a verb like "graduate" the situation is rather different because many sentences mediate to form its meaning. One may say that it is an accomplishment verb, but that is not saying much. Trying to provide a CD representation <ref> (Schank, 1975) </ref> for it seems hopeless. The key point here is that the representation needs to make possible the inferences normally associated with such verb. For instance, that if one is asked which school Clinton attended, one should say "Yale" upon reading that Clinton grad uated from Yale.

Reference-contexts: Each thematic role is followed by any number of list pairs. The first list contains the selectional restrictions, a subset of the ontological categories in WordNet, in order of preference <ref> (Wilks, 1975) </ref> for the thematic role, and the second list contains the syntactic relations (henceforth, SRs) that may realize the thematic role. For any given sentence, only one of the SRs in the list realizes the role.
