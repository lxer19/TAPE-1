Abstract: In the last few years, modeling dynamic human control strategy (HCS) is becoming an increasingly popular paradigm in a number of different research areas, such as the intelligent vehicle highway system, virtual reality and robotics. Usually, these models are derived empirically, rather than analytically, from real human input-output control data. As such, there is a great need to develop adequate performance criteria for these models, as few guarantees exist about their theoretical performance. It is our goal in this paper to develop several such criteria. In this paper, we first collect driving data from different individuals through a real-time graphic driving simulator. We then model each individuals control strategy through the flexible cascade neural network learning architecture. Next, we develop two performance measures for evaluating the resulting HCS models, one dealing with obstacle avoidance, the other with tight-turning behavior. Finally, we evaluate the relative skill of different HCS models through the proposed performance criteria.

Reference-contexts: Because human control strategy (HCS) is a dynamic, nonlinear stochastic process, developing good analytic models of human control strategies, tends to be difficult. Therefore, recent work in modeling HCS has focussed on learning empirical models, through, for example, fuzzy logic [1,2], and neural network techniques <ref> [3] </ref>. Since these HCS models are empirical, few if any guarantees exist about their theoretical performance. Thus, performance evaluation is an integral aspect of HCS modeling research, without which it is impossible to rank or prefer one HCS controller over another.

Reference-contexts: It is the goal of this work to define performance criteria by which the driving models performance can be evaluated and ranked. In previous work, a stochastic similarity measure, which compares model-generated control trajectories to the original human training data, has been proposed for validating HCS models <ref> [4] </ref>. While this similarity measure can ensure that the neural network model adequately captures the driving characteristics of the human operator, it does not measure a particular models skill or performance. In other words, it does not (nor can it) tell us which model is better or worse.

Reference-contexts: The human operators view of the road ahead is limited to 100m. Finally, the entire simulator is run at 50Hz. 3. HCS modeling In this paper, we choose the flexible cascade neural network architecture with node-decoupled extended Kalman filtering (NDEKF) <ref> [5, 6] </ref> for modeling the human driving data. We prefer this learning architecture over others for a number of reasons. First, no a priori model structure is assumed; the neural network automatically adds hidden units to an initially minimal network as the training requires. <p> Finally, it has been shown that node-decoupled extended Kalman filtering, a quadratically convergent alternative to slower gradient descent training algorithms (such as backpropagation or quickprop) fits well within the cascade learning framework and converges to good local minima with less computation <ref> [5] </ref>. The flexible functional form which cascade learning allows is ideal for abstracting human control strategies, since we know very little about the underlying structure of each individuals internal controller.
