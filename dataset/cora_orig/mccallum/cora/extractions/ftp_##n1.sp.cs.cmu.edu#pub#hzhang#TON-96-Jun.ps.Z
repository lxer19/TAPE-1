Abstract: Compressed digital video is one of the most important traffic types in future integrated services networks. However, a network service that supports delay-sensitive video imposes many problems since compressed video sources are variable bit rate (VBR) with a high degree of burstiness. In this paper, we consider a network service that can provide deterministic guarantees on the minimum throughput and the maximum delay of VBR video traffic. A common belief is that due to the burstiness of VBR traffic, such a service will not be efficient and will necessarily result in low network utilization. We investigate the fundamental limits and tradeoffs in providing deterministic performance guarantees to video and use a set of 10 to 30 minute long MPEG-compressed video traces for evaluation. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we are able to show that, in many cases, a deterministic service can be provided to video traffic while maintaining a reasonable level of network utilization. We first consider an ideal network environment that employs the most accurate deterministic, time-invariant video traffic characterizations, the optimal Earliest-Deadline-First packet schedulers, and exact admission control conditions. The utilization achievable in this situation provides the fundamental limits of a deterministic service. We then investigate the utilization limits in a network environment that takes into account practical constraints, such as the need for simple and efficient policing mechanisms, packet scheduling algorithms, and admission control tests.

Reference-contexts: However, 1 For VBR video, we consider the stream's peak rate to be the size of the largest video frame divided by the inter-frame time. several recent works show that this conventional wisdom is not correct and that peak-rate allocation is not required even for providing deterministic service <ref> [2, 8, 9, 17] </ref>. In this study, we analyze the fundamental limits in providing deterministic performance guarantees to VBR video. <p> by a function A such that A [t; t + t] denotes the traffic arrivals in the time interval [t; t +t], an upper bound on A can be given by a function A fl if for all times t 0 and all interval lengths t 0 the following holds <ref> [1, 2] </ref>: A [t; t + t] A fl (t) (1) We refer to a function A fl (t) that satisfies the property in (1) as a traffic constraint function. <p> This worst-case parameterization of a source has an associated traffic constraint function given in Table 1. The (; ) model <ref> [2] </ref> describes traffic in terms of a rate factor and a burstiness factor such that during any time interval of length t, the traffic from a connection is less than + t. <p> To ensure that the policing mechanisms can monitor and control traffic at high data rates, the complexity of the traffic model is limited. In <ref> [2] </ref>, it was shown that a traffic model with a piece-wise linear concave traffic constraint function can be policed by a fixed number of leaky buckets. <p> Here we consider the following well-known scheduling disciplines at a packet scheduler for a set N of connections: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Static Priority (SP), and Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF). Each of these disciplines has been investigated for use in bounded delay services <ref> [2, 4, 9, 16] </ref>. First-Come-First-Served schedulers transmit all packets in the order of their arrival. Since the maximum delay in a FCFS scheduler is the same for all connections j 2 N , all connections have an identical delay bound d. <p> Table 2 shows the necessary and sufficient delay bound tests ("Exact Tests") for each scheduler. Formal derivations of these tests can be found in <ref> [2, 9] </ref>. Since the exact admission test for an SP scheduler is computa-tionally very complex, Table 3 presents less accurate tests ("Sufficient Tests") that require less computation [9, 17]. <p> Note that this traffic constraint function A fl (t) is guaranteed to be concave and can thus be policed with an n-level leaky bucket <ref> [2, 8] </ref>. The algorithm, shown in Figure 3, assumes that the values of the empirical envelope are available up to some time limit t .

Reference-contexts: Depending on the class of service disciplines considered, various techniques may be applied. Several examples are as follows. First, end-to-end delay bounds for the class of work-conserving service disciplines are de rived in <ref> [3] </ref>. This is achieved by calculating a bound on the transformation of a stream's constraint function A fl (t) as it traverses each consecutive hop. An end-to-end delay bound can then be calculated by summing the local, per-hop delay bounds. <p> This prevents the traffic constraint function from becoming "burstier" as the stream traverses multiple hops, as occurs in <ref> [3] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Of the many traffic classes in integrated services networks, delay-sensitive Variable Bit Rate (VBR) video traffic poses a unique challenge. Since the required service is delay-sensitive, the network must support a resource reservation scheme <ref> [4] </ref> that allocates network resources for each VBR video stream. However, the burstiness of VBR video traffic makes it difficult to determine the amount of resources required. <p> A deterministic service ensures that no packets are dropped or delayed beyond their guaranteed delay bound. Such a service requires admission control tests to determine if the network has sufficient resources to support a new connection without degrading the service of existing connections <ref> [4, 7] </ref>. The tests for a new connection are based on a characterization of the expected traffic for the new connection. If accepting or admitting the new connection may result in violations of service guarantees for any existing connection, the connection is not established. <p> In practice, a source specifies its traffic characterization with a parameterized model. The parameterized deterministic traffic model defines a traffic constraint function that bounds the source. For example, in the (x min ; x ave ; I; s) model <ref> [4] </ref>, x min is the minimum packet inter-arrival time, x ave is the maximum average packet inter-arrival time over any time interval of length I, and s is the maximum packet size. This worst-case parameterization of a source has an associated traffic constraint function given in Table 1. <p> Here we consider the following well-known scheduling disciplines at a packet scheduler for a set N of connections: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Static Priority (SP), and Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF). Each of these disciplines has been investigated for use in bounded delay services <ref> [2, 4, 9, 16] </ref>. First-Come-First-Served schedulers transmit all packets in the order of their arrival. Since the maximum delay in a FCFS scheduler is the same for all connections j 2 N , all connections have an identical delay bound d. <p> SP schedulers maintain one FCFS queue for each priority level, always selecting the first packet in the highest-priority FCFS queue for transmission. With Earliest-Deadline-First scheduling <ref> [4] </ref>, each connection j 2 N is assigned a delay bound d j , where the delay bound may be different for each connection. <p> An end-to-end delay bound can then be calculated by summing the local, per-hop delay bounds. Second, for a class of service disciplines called rate-controlled service disciplines [18], e.g., Rate-Controlled Static Priority [16] and a rate-controlled variation of EDF <ref> [4] </ref>, a stream's original constraint function A fl (t) is restored at each hop along the path via a rate controller. This prevents the traffic constraint function from becoming "burstier" as the stream traverses multiple hops, as occurs in [3].

The algorithm, shown in Figure 3, assumes that the values of the empirical envelope are available up to some time limit t . <p> Finally, as an illustrative example to emphasize the potential simplicity of approximating E fl for VBR video, we note as in <ref> [8] </ref> that for MPEG video sources, one possible concise and simple-to-obtain parameterization of A fl is to use knowledge of the frame pattern along with a parameterization of the largest sized I frame, B frame, and P frame. <p> The reason that it does in this case is that the advantage of considering a non-concave constraint function is only apparent with heterogeneous sources. Further discussion of this concavity issue may be found in <ref> [8] </ref>, which allows a non-concave constraint function with the D-BIND model. 4.3 Tradeoffs in Packet Scheduling In this section, we compare the performance of the three different packet schedulers discussed in x2.2, namely EDF, SP and FCFS.

Empirical envelopes represent the most accurate, time-invariant, deterministic characterization of a traffic source. Using this optimal characterization, together with Earliest-Deadline-First packet scheduling and the exact admission control tests from [9], we provide insights into the highest achievable utilization for VBR video sources. We also investigate the fundamental tradeoffs that must be considered for practical networking environments. For example, a realistic traffic characterization must be easily policeable by the network. <p> A requirement on A fl for the admission control tests is subadditivity, i.e., for all t 1 0 and all t 2 0 we have A fl (t 1 + t 2 ) A fl (t 1 ) + A fl (t 2 ) <ref> [1, 9] </ref>. <p> Here we consider the following well-known scheduling disciplines at a packet scheduler for a set N of connections: First-Come-First-Served (FCFS), Static Priority (SP), and Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF).

Yet, to assess the applicability of the deterministic approach to VBR video, several important questions must be answered.
