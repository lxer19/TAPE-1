Title: Addressing the Software Engineering Assessment Crisis  
Author: Lindsey Ford, Brian Lings, and Wendy Milne 
Keyword: software engineering, assessment  
Address: Exeter  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science University of Exeter  
Abstract: There is a need to be able to assess whether students have acquired real software engineering knowledge and skills. It is all very well pointing to a student succeeding in individual courses on topics such as systems analysis, HCI, and formal systems, but can the student use this disparate knowledge coherently on a large project? Furthermore a student may be able to work efficiently on an individual project but can the same student work within a team-based project environment with staged deadlines to meet and perhaps difficult fellow team members? We report on our attempt to impart and assess these skills and knowledge. Early feedback suggests that some real learning has taken place.

Reference-contexts: Our failings are largely the result of not investing enough time with students. Assessment for Software Engineering is generally recognized as time-intensive "...monitoring and assessing such projects is very demanding in terms of staff effort" [British Computer Society89]. But perhaps there is a way of spreading this load. Avison <ref> [Avison88] </ref> reports on how an in-house project that helped with staff administrative duties encouraged staff not directly involved with the course to become involved as clients. <p> The refinement we have made to our undergraduate programme can be seen as a continuation of the action learning ideas of Wood-Harper [Wood-Harper83], in which industrial placement was paramount, and Avison <ref> [Avison88] </ref>, who introduced large practical projects to students after relevant courses had been presented. The intriguing element we have introduced is the interleaving of lectures with practical work.
