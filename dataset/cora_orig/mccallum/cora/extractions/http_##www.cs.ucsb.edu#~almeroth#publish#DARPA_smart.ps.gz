Abstract: In the near future users will be able to move freely and still have seamless network and Internet connectivity. We envision that the Internet of the future will interconnect mobile or stationary clouds into the existing IP infrastructure. While many of the Internet protocols are immensely successful in traditional networks, we believe they will be inappropriate for communication among limited-capability devices in amorphous clouds. The question we are trying to address is whether the network layer services provided by IPv4 and IPv6 [1] are necessary and sufficient for supporting heterogeneous devices in these highly dynamic, arbitrarily dense environments. The problem with an IP infrastructure is that, for certain applications, it adds unnecessary complexity. The proposed research is based on the specification of a new network layer protocol for intra-network communication in clouds containing devices with limited processing and communication capabilities. Our Pseudo-IP protocol is designed to operate among devices in the farthest branches/leaves of an internet while providing inter-network connectivity with other clouds and the existing IP infrastructure. Our goal is to extend the scope of IP to environments containing devices that cannot handle the extra complexity introduced by routing, error detection/recovery, optional headers, and even addressing. More intelligent devices interacting in the cloud will be responsible for interoperating with the existing IP infrastructure including IP-based devices that happen to be roaming locally.

One example scenario is a cloud of thousands of sensors transmitting small pieces of data.

Reference-contexts: We believe that our Pseudo-IP protocol will be an important enabling technology for the Internet of the future since it will allow limited-capability devices to be connected to the existing IP infrastructure. One research initiative related to the proposed ideas is the Daedalus/BARWAN project <ref> [2] </ref> at UC Berkeley. More specifically, they have proposed an architecture that supports adaptive client device's functionality to new services that are discovered/located as the client moves [3]. Their architecture is based on the existing IP infrastructure.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section describes a number of potential applications and their requirements.

Reference-contexts: One common application consists of drivers receiving information about road conditions, restaurants, shopping, service plaza amenities, etc. via broadcast transmissions. This type of data can be broadcast repeatedly so reliability (other than through non-ACK based techniques like forward error correction <ref> [4] </ref>) is not required. However, some applications may provide transaction-based services like ordering food before arriving at a highway exit. In these scenarios, the network protocol would have to facilitate reliable, secure transactions.

Reference-contexts: Obviously the most common network layer protocol is IPv4 1 . In considering what functionality Pseudo-IP should provide, we should examine what functions IPv4 provides. They include the following <ref> [5] </ref>: * Packet length 1 bytes * Identification/Sequence number 2 bytes * Fragmentation/reassembly approximately 2 bytes * Time to live 1 byte * Upper layer protocol identifier 1 byte * Header checksum 2 byte * Source and destination addressing 8 bytes * Miscellaneous other bits 2 bytes * Options and variable

Reference-contexts: If devices implement a wireless protocol like the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN standard, fewer Pseudo-IP functions will be required because 802.11 provides its own addressing and checksum mechanisms; uses collision avoidance; and has provisions for acknowledgments <ref> [6] </ref>. Other, simpler medium access control protocols might have to be used like Aloha [7] and slotted-Aloha [8]. Specifically then, what Pseudo-IP should provide is (1) a lightweight interface for communication among dumb or semi-intelligent devices, and (2) protocol translation between Pseudo-IP and traditional IP.

Much of the routing functionality will be based on radio transmissions, i.e., the fact that these unconventional devices are usually broadcast-capable. 4.
