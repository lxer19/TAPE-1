Abstract: The performance of a distributed dynamic channel allocation algorithm is measured by the call blocking rate, the number of messages exchanged per channel acquisition, and the delay incurred in acquiring a channel. In general, there are two approaches to design a distributed channel allocation algorithms: Search and Update. Both of these approaches have advantages and disadvantages. The update approach has shorter acquisition delay and lower call blocking rate, but higher message complexity. On the other hand, the search approach has lower message complexity, but longer acquisition delay and higher call blocking rate. In this paper, we first propose a novel distributed acquisition algorithm, which has similar message complexity as the search approach and similar acquisition delay as the update approach. Then, we present a channel selection algorithm and integrate it into our distributed acquisition algorithm. By a rigorous analysis in terms of delay and message complexity, we show that our channel selection algorithm performs significantly better than the update approach [4] and the search approach [12]. Detailed simulation experiments are carried out in order to evaluate our proposed methodology. The performance of our algorithm is compared with those of the Geometric strategy [1], the Search approach [12], and the Update approach [4]. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms all other approaches in terms of call blocking probability under uniform as well as non-uniform traffic.

Reference-contexts: However, two different cells cannot use the same channel if their geographic distance is less than a threshold, called the minimum channel reuse distance (D min ) <ref> [1, 11] </ref>; otherwise, the communication sessions will interfere with each other. 1 A channel is available for a cell if its use in the cell does not interfere with others. When a cell needs a channel, it acquires one available channel using a channel allocation algorithm. <p> A call is blocked if there is no channel available for use when the call is being set up or when it is being handed over to another cell due to a host mobility. Channel selection algorithms have been extensively studied <ref> [1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14] </ref>. However, most of them depend on a Mobile Switching Center (M SC) to accomplish channel acquisition, which are referred to as the centralized channel acquisition algorithms. <p> Detailed simulation experiments are carried out to evaluate our proposed methodology. The performance of our algorithm is compared with those of the Geometric strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, the Search approach [12], and the Update approach [4]. Simulation results show that our algorithm outperforms all other approaches in terms of call blocking probability under uniform and non-uniform traffics. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the system model. <p> As shown in Figure 1, R is the cell radius, D min is the minimum channel reuse distance. If a fourth-power law attenuation is assumed <ref> [1, 10] </ref>, the signal to interference ratio is given by [S=I] min = [(D min =R) 1] 4 =6. With D min = 3 p 3R, [S=I] min 17dB, which is a reasonable value in practice. <p> Resource Planning Model Most of channel selection strategies require a priori information about channel status in order to achieve better channel reuse. For instance, in the channel borrowing strategies [5, 7, 11], each cell is allocated a set of "nominal" channels before hand; in the geometric strategy <ref> [1] </ref>, each cell must know its "first-choice" channels prior to any channel acquisition. We call the process of assigning 3 special status to channels as the resource planning [3, 4]. Resource Planning 1. <p> Then, we give a performance analysis of our channel allocation algorithm and compare it with the search and the update approaches. 4.1 The Channel Selection Algorithm Similar to the Geometric strategy <ref> [1] </ref> and the channel selection algorithm in the update approach [4], our channel selection algorithm makes use of the optimal resource planning model defined in Section 2. The primary channels for each cell are prioritized.

Section 6 concludes the paper. 2 System Model The geographical area is divided into hexagonal cells in a mobile cellular network <ref> [6] </ref>. Each cell is supported by a M SS in the center (we use cell and M SS interchangeably). The M SSs are connected to each other by a static wired network, which provides reliable F IF O communications.

Reference-contexts: If a newly available channel has a higher priority than some used channel, an intra-handoff is performed. Our algorithm is different from the Geometric and the update approaches when assigning priority to secondary channels.
