Abstract: 2 -conservative over primitive recursive arithmetic PRA (and even weaker fragments of arithmetic). In [9] we established such conservation results relative to finite type extensions PRA ! of PRA (together with a quantifier-free axiom of choice schema). In this setting one can consider also a uniform version UWKL of WKL which asserts the existence of a functional which selects uniformly in a given infinite binary tree f an infinite path f of that tree. This uniform version of WKL is of interest in the context of explicit mathematics as developed by S. Feferman. The elimination process used in [9] actually eliminates even this uniform weak Konig's lemma provided that PRA ! only has a quantifier-free rule of extensionality QF-ER instead of the full axioms (E) of extensionality for all finite types. In this paper we show that in the presence of (E), UWKL is much stronger than WKL: whereas WKL

Reference-contexts: The conservation results in [9] are much more general than the one we mentioned. This makes the proofs more involved than is needed for the special ( 0 2 -)case relevant here. A corresponding simplification of our argument has been worked out in <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 The system E-PRA ! is formulated in the language of functionals of all finite types and contains ae;o ; ffi;ae;o -combinators for all types (which allow to define -abstraction) and all primitive recursive functionals in the sense of Kleene (i.e. primitive recursion is available only on the type 0).
