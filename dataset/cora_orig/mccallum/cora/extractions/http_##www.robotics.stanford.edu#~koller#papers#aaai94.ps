Abstract: The situation calculus is a popular technique for reasoning about action and change. However, its restriction to a first-order syntax and pure deductive reasoning makes it unsuitable in many contexts. In particular, we often face uncertainty, due either to lack of knowledge or to some probabilistic aspects of the world. While attempts have been made to address aspects of this problem, most notably using nonmonotonic reasoning formalisms, the general problem of uncertainty in reasoning about action has not been fully dealt with in a logical framework. In this paper we present a theory of action that extends the situation calculus to deal with uncertainty. Our framework is based on applying the random-worlds approach of [BGHK94] to a situation calculus ontology, enriched to allow the expression of probabilistic action effects. Our approach is able to solve many of the problems imposed by incomplete and probabilistic knowledge within a unified framework. In particular, we obtain a default Markov property for chains of actions, a derivation of conditional independence from irrele vance, and a simple solution to the frame problem.

Reference-contexts: Baker and Ginsberg's [BG89] solution to the frame problem (based on circumscription) relies on a similar notion of counterfactual situations. But while the solutions are related, they are not identical: for instance, we do not suffer from the problem concerning extraneous fluents that Baker <ref> [Bak89] </ref> mentions. 7 7 We also note that Baker and Ginsberg's solution was constructed especially to deal with the problem of minimizing frame violations.

Reference-contexts: Writing down a very natural expression of a frame axiom almost immediately gives the desired behavior. We state a theorem, based on the criterion of Kartha [Kar93], showing the general correctness of our approach's solution to the frame problem. We also compare our solution to one given by Baker <ref> [Bak91] </ref>. Preliminaries The situation calculus We assume some familiarity with the situation calculus and associated issues. In brief, by situation calculus we refer to a method of reasoning about temporal phenomena using first-order logic and a sorted ontology consisting of actions and situations. <p> be at most one state for each of the 2 k possible truth values of the fluents. 4 3 We observe that we can easily extend our ontology to allow complex fluents (e.g., On (A,B) in the blocks world), and/or reified fluents. 4 This restriction was also used by Baker <ref> [Bak91] </ref> in his solution to the frame problem. <p> They have been used in both philosophy and statistics to give semantics to causal rules [Rub74]. In game theory [Sta94] the importance of counterfactuals (or strategies) has long been recognized. Baker's approach <ref> [Bak91] </ref> to the frame problem is, in fact, also based on the use of counterfactuals. We have already mentioned that random-worlds subsumes the principle of maximum entropy. It has been argued [Pea88] that maximum entropy (and hence random-worlds) cannot deal appropriate with causal information. <p> Roughly speaking, he showed that a simple procedural language A [GL92] can be embedded into three approaches for dealing with the frame problem <ref> [Bak91, Ped89, Rei91] </ref>, so that the answers prescribed by A's semantics (which are the intuitively right answers) are also obtained by these formalisms. The following result shows that we also pass Kartha's test.

Reference-contexts: The reasons for this failure are subtle, and cannot be explained within the space limitations. However, as we discuss in the full paper, the problem is closely related to the fact that random worlds does not learn statistics from samples. This aspect of random-worlds was discussed in <ref> [BGHK92] </ref>, where we also presented an alternative method to computing degrees of belief, the random-propensities approach, that does support learning. In future work, we hope to apply this alternative approach to the ontology described in this framework.

Reference-contexts: Recent work has shown that such pessimism is unjustified. In this paper we use a new theory of probabilistic reasoning called the random-worlds method <ref> [BGHK94] </ref> which naturally extends first-order logic. We show that this method can be successfully applied to temporal reasoning, yielding a natural and powerful extension of the situation calculus. The outline of this paper is as follows. <p> The idea of reasoning to plausible conclusions, rather than only the deductively certain ones, clearly shares some motivation with our decision to evaluate numeric probabilities. The connection is in fact quite deep; see <ref> [BGHK94] </ref>. However, the application of pure non-monotonic logics to reasoning about actions has proven to be surprisingly difficult and, in any event, these approaches are not capable of dealing with probabilistic actions or with the quantitative assessment of probabilities. <p> Finally, none of these works subsume all the issues addressed by advocates of nonmonotonic reasoning. Our approach provides a framework for dealing with these issues in a uniform fashion. Random-worlds We now turn to a summary of the random-worlds method; see <ref> [BGHK94] </ref> and the references therein for full details. We emphasize that this is a general technique for computing probabilities, given arbitrary knowledge expressed in a very rich language; it was not developed specifically for the problem of reasoning about action and change. <p> We emphasize that this is a general technique for computing probabilities, given arbitrary knowledge expressed in a very rich language; it was not developed specifically for the problem of reasoning about action and change. As a general reasoning method, random-worlds has been shown to possess many attractive features <ref> [BGHK94] </ref>, including a preference for more specific information and the ability to ignore irrelevant information. <p> Results As a minimal requirement, we would like our approach to be compatible with standard deductive reasoning, whenever the latter is appropriate. As shown in <ref> [BGHK94] </ref>, this desideratum is automatically satisfied by random worlds: Proposition 1: If ' is a logical consequence of a knowledge base KB, then Pr w Hence, our approach supports all the conclusions that can be derived using ordinary situation calculus. <p> a car disappear from the parking lot is the StealCar action, then we would conclude that: Pr 1 (A i = StealCarjKB ^ :Parked (Result 1 (A ` ; Result ( Result (A 1 ; Result (ParkCar; V 0 ; E)) )))) = 1 ` : Conclusion As shown in <ref> [BGHK94] </ref>, the random-worlds approach provides a general framework for probabilistic and default first-order reasoning. The key to adapting random worlds to the domain of causal and temporal reasoning lies in the use of counterfactual ontologies to represent causal information.

Reference-contexts: There has also been work addressing the issue of probabil-ities in the context of actions. The propositional approaches to the problem (e.g., <ref> [Han90, DK89] </ref>) do not incorporate the full expressive power of the situation calculus. <p> We now turn to the problem of reasoning about the effects of a sequence of actions. The Markov assumption, which is built into most systems that reason about probabilistic actions <ref> [Han90, DK89] </ref>, asserts that the effects of an action depend only on the state in which it is taken. As the following result demonstrates, our approach derives this principle from the basic semantics.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we turn to examining one of the most famous issues that arise when reasoning about action: the Frame Problem and the associated Yale Shooting Problem (YSP) <ref> [MH69, HM87] </ref>. We show that our approach can solve the former problem, without suffering from the latter, almost automatically. Writing down a very natural expression of a frame axiom almost immediately gives the desired behavior. <p> Before continuing, we remark that the importance of the issues we have raised is well known. There have been numerous attempts to augment deductive reasoning with the ability to jump to conclusions, i.e., nonmonotonic reasoning (e.g., <ref> [HM87, Kau86, Lif87] </ref>), often in an attempt to solve the frame problem. The idea of reasoning to plausible conclusions, rather than only the deductively certain ones, clearly shares some motivation with our decision to evaluate numeric probabilities. The connection is in fact quite deep; see [BGHK94]. <p> This suggests that if we could formalize this general principle (that change is unusual), it could serve as a substitute for the many explicit frame axioms that would otherwise be needed. However, as shown in <ref> [HM87] </ref>, the most obvious formulations of this idea in standard nonmonotonic logics often fail. Suppose we use a formalism that, in some way, tries to minimize the number of changes in the world.

All these applications of counterfactuals turn out to be closely linked to our own, even though none consider the random-worlds method.

This solves the original YSP because the model in which Fred dies violates the frame axiom (that Fred should remain alive) later than the model in which the gun miraculously becomes unloaded. <p> This solves the original YSP because the model in which Fred dies violates the frame axiom (that Fred should remain alive) later than the model in which the gun miraculously becomes unloaded.

Reference-contexts: Introduction The situation calculus is a well-known logical technique for reasoning about action and change <ref> [MH69] </ref>. Calculi of this sort provide a useful mechanism for dealing with simple temporal phenomena, and serve as a foundation for work in planning. Nevertheless, the many restrictions inherent in the situation calculus have inspired continuing work on extending its scope. <p> Finally, we turn to examining one of the most famous issues that arise when reasoning about action: the Frame Problem and the associated Yale Shooting Problem (YSP) <ref> [MH69, HM87] </ref>. We show that our approach can solve the former problem, without suffering from the latter, almost automatically. Writing down a very natural expression of a frame axiom almost immediately gives the desired behavior. <p> For instance, we would need to say that after a Wait action, a loaded gun continues to be loaded, if Fred was alive before he will be alive afterwards, and so on. The issue of stating the non-effects of actions is known as the frame problem <ref> [MH69] </ref>: how do we avoid having to represent the numerous axioms required to describe non-effects? We would like to omit or abbreviate these axioms somehow.
