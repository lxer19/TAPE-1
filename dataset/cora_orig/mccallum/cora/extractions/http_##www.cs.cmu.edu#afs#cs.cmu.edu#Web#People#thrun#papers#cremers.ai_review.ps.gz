Abstract: Focusing on examples of knowledge systems and machine learning, this paper illustrates the transfer of AI technology from science to real-world applications. Decades of AI research precede a rather short but significant period, in which companies report the useful exploitation of AI technology. This paper illustrates the role played by science, and it argues that AI is just beginning to produce an ever increasingly variety of real world applications.

Reference-contexts: Asakawa and Takagi [2] report an impressive list of consumer products based on neural network technology, including washing machines, driers, vacuum cleaners, rice cookers, and many more. For example, Stork and co-workers at Ricoh <ref> [7] </ref> have implemented neural network learning and pruning in commercially available photocopying machines, in which networks are used to control the voltage of several critical components that influence the quality of the prints. Asakawa and Takagi also report various industrial applications, such as financial forecasting, process control, and word processing.

The roots of formal neural network models can be traced back to early work by McCulloch and Pitts [16] and Hebb <ref> [9] </ref> in the 40's, who established first models of neural processing and plasticity. Minsky [18], in the late 60's, showed some of the limitations of the early methods, which had quite a discouraging effect on the field.

Reference-contexts: However, such techniques were not always motivated by industrial applications. For example, the theory of fuzzy sets [37], which is now broadly applied to consumer products in Japan, was originally developed in 1965. Some 10 years later, in 1974, it was applied to control <ref> [14] </ref>, which eventually triggered various industrial applications [28].

Reference-contexts: Recently machine learning technology has begun to make its way to real-world applications.

More specifically, the system is able to detect malign cancer cells in fine needle aspirates by visually inspecting images of cells with close to 100% accuracy.

Reference-contexts: Active learning techniques, to name a second example, refer to learning approaches in which a learner can act, and explore its environment [1,30]. At the same time, remarkable progress has been made in the theoretical understanding of learning from examples <ref> [31] </ref>. In particular, researchers have related what a learner can learn and the amount of training instances required for learning. This trade-off, known as bias-variance dilemma, is fundamental in machine learning.
