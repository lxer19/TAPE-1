Title: ABSTRACT  
Keyword: multimedia authoring, hypermedia authoring, composition, synchronization  
Abstract: We present the user interface to the CMIF authoring environment for constructing and playing multimedia presentations. Within the environment an author constructs a presentation in terms of its structure and additional synchronization constraints, from which the actual timing information is derived. The CMIF authoring environment presents three main views of a multimedia presentation: a hierarchy view for manipulating and viewing a presentations hierarchical structure; a channel view for managing logical resources and specifying and viewing precise timing constraints; and a player for playing the presentation.

Reference-contexts: These allow the explicit manipulation of the structure of a presentation rather than the implicit manipulation of this structure via, for example, a time-line. The CMIF authoring environment was designed to support the composition of CMIF-based multimedia presentations from existing media items. CMIF (CWI Multimedia Interchange Format) <ref> [1] </ref> is a system-independent representation of multimedia documents. We present the three different views of a multimedia presentation supported in the CMIF environment. Since the authors are based in Amsterdam, we invite attendees of InterCHI 93 to contact us for a visit and demo during the conference.

Reference-contexts: The hierarchically structured nodes of the presentation are represented as nested boxes, where children of a node are played either sequentially or in parallel. The function of this view is similar to the editing tool described in <ref> [4] </ref>.

This leads to fragmentation of the authoring process and unnecessary work when re-using or updating parts of the presentation.
