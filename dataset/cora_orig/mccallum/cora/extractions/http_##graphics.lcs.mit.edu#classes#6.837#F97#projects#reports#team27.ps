Title: Tempest A Physically Based Modeler of the Effects of Wind on Cloth  
Author: Laminae Jason Miller James Morgan 
Note: 11/26/97  
Abstract: 6.837 Computer Graphics Final Project Report Abstract Tempest is a Java program which takes as input a description of a rectangular planar cloth object and outputs a series of 3D triangle meshes representing the time-varying shape of the cloth. Our goal is to simulate realistically the motion of cloth subject to wind and gravitational forces. We apply our technique by creating a short animation of multiple flags waving in the wind. This paper discusses our initial goals for the project, the simplifying assumptions we had to make, the obstacles we overcame and those we did not overcome, and the process by which we created both our physical model (wind/cloth simulator) and our 3D model (animated scene).

Reference-contexts: A sequence of flags generated by our program. Notice that the motion close to the pole is roughly physical but indicative of a very stretchy material. The model we are using is primarily based on two sources, Terzopoulos <ref> [1] </ref> and Wejchert [2]. Terzopoulos describes the method for modeling the cloth object (in our case a flag) subject to external forces. The model balances internal forces due to momentum, energy loss and elastic properties against the external forces.

Reference-contexts: The result of his method is a large system of linear equations in the matrix form: Ar = g. Since A is a band diagonal matrix (as commonly emerges from finite differencing solutions to partial differential equations) we used an algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> which takes advantage of this to reduce both the time and space required to solve the system. The largest difficulties we had with the physical model were related to our insufficient math and physics background.
