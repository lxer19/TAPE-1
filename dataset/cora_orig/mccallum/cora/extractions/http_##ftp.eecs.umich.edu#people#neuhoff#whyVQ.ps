Abstract: Why do vector quantizers outperform scalar quantizers when the source is stationary and memoryless? This question is frequently asked by newcomers to VQ, who recognize that, in this case, its ability to exploit correlation is of no use. An interesting approach (c.f. [1]) is to a compare k-dimensional VQ with rate R to the k-dimensional product quantizer (PQ) induced by applying a scalar quantizer (SQ) with rate R to k successive source samples. It is then evident that one advantage of VQ is that its cells are more spherical than those of the PQ, which are rectangular. Another is that the points of the VQ are better distributed. Indeed, it is often thought that the PQ distributes points in a "cubic" fashion, whereas the VQ matches its point distribution to the source; e.g. spherical for a Gaussian density. Using asymptotic quantization theory, we show that aside from the rectangularity of the induced PQ's cells, the shortcoming of SQ's is not that they are incapable of inducing a PQ with an optimal point density. Rather, the structure of the PQ links the point density and cell shapes in a way that causes the best SQ to be a compromise between that which induces the best point density and that which induces the best cell shapes. Consequently, the optimum SQ suffers a point density loss and a cell shape loss. For large rates, we find formulas for these and evaluate them in the Gaussian and Laplacian cases. For example, in the Gaussian case, relative to high-dimensional VQ, an SQ has a 1.88 dB "point density" loss, a 1.53 dB "cubic" loss and a .94 dB "oblongitis" loss. SUMARY OF RESULTS l pr (x) = l 1 (x 1 )l 1 (x k ), where x = (x 1 ,,x k ). Its cells are rectangular (cubic on the diagonals), and the effect of their shapes on the mean squared error (MSE) is contained in the inertial profile m pr , which equals the normalized moment of k,N , of an optimal k-dimensional VQ, which we call the loss L. Using the vector version of Bennett's integral [2] and assuming N 1 is large, we find L = D k and the same point density. The oblongitis loss, L ob , is the ratio of the MSE of the PQ to that of a VQ with the same point density, but cubic cells; i.e. it is due to rectangularity. The product of cubic and oblongitis losses is the cell shape loss. -1/3 which are listed in Table 1, along with L cu , for various k. For a Laplacian density, the point density and cubic losses are the squares of those for the Gaussian density. They are larger (by a factor of 2 in dB) because the sharper peak and heavier tails cause an optimal SQ to be more nonuniform.
