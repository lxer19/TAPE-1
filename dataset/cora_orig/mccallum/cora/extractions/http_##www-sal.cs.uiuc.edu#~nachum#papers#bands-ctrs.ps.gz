Reference-contexts: In 1968, Novikov and Adian, in a series of papers, showed that there are infinite Burnside groups for all odd m 4381; this negative result was extended to odd m 665 in Adian's monograph [ 1979 ] on the subject (to which <ref> [ Adian, 1977 ] </ref> serves as an introduction). More recently, the bound was improved to 115, and the conjecture was shown false for all m greater than 2 13 [Adian, personal communication].

Reference-contexts: To obtain a sequence of cube-free words over two letters, 0 and 1, one can apply the map: a 7! 01, b 7! 010, and c 7! 0110. For details, see <ref> [ Adian, 1979, Chap. I ] </ref> . Since there are only finitely many square-free words over a binary alphabet, this argument does not work for n = 2 and jAj = 2. Nevertheless, Brzozowski, Culik and a abc acb cab . . . [0] [001 001 100] . . . <p> VI ] ). The word problem is also decidable for finitely presented groups whose relations are all of the form w n = 1, with n is sufficiently large <ref> [ Adian, 1979, Preface ] </ref> .

Reference-contexts: It was Axel Thue [ 1912 ] who first constructed an infinite square-free word over a three letter alphabet, as well as an infinite cube-free word in a binary alphabet. The infinite sequence of square-free words in Figure 1 is due to Arson <ref> [ Arson, 1937 ] </ref> : Each word is obtained from the previous by substituting a 7! abc, b 7! bca, and c 7! cab for letters in odd positions, and a 7! cba, b 7! acb, and c 7! bac, for letters in even positions.

Reference-contexts: For bands, for example, one need only include a rule w ! w 0 , where w 0 is the shortest word equivalent to w, whenever w is of length up to 2 n+1 1 and w 6= w 0 . (See <ref> [ Benninghofen et al., 1987, Chap. II ] </ref> .) Longer rules have reducible left-hand sides, and contribute nothing.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Ninety years ago, Burnside [ 1902 ] posed the question whether every group satisfying the identity x m = 1, and having a finite number of generators, is finite. In 1969, Brzozowski (see the list of open questions in <ref> [ Brzozowski, 1980 ] </ref> ) conjectured that the congruence classes on words generated by x n+1 = x n , are all regular sets. Recently, McCammond [ 1991 ] extended this conjecture to all semigroups satisfying x m+n = x n and investigated the decidability of their word problems. <p> Brzozowski, Culik, and Gabrielian [ 1971 ] showed that each of the classes in Figure 2 is regular which lent support to the conjecture that such is the case for all equivalence classes for the semigroup varieties x n+1 = x n . Imre Simon, in unpublished notes (see <ref> [ Brzozowski, 1980 ] </ref> ), contributed to this problem. The first solution, for n 5, was by de Luca and Varricchio [ 1990 ] who believed their method could be extended to n = 4.

Reference-contexts: If there is an effective way of generating a finite set of rules for reducing any given word to normal form, then the word problem is decidable. For notation and concepts related to rewriting, see <ref> [ Dershowitz and Jouannaud, 1990 ] </ref> . 2 Finiteness Burnside [ 1902 ] showed that the groups x m = 1, for m = 1; 2; 3, are finite and asked whether the same was true for all m.

IV ] </ref> and [ Siekmann and Szabo, 1982 ] . Finitely generated bands are finite, since there are only finitely many words not equivalent to a shorter word.

In these papers, termination of reduction is invariably based simply on word length. <p> The notions of local and global confluence do play an important role in the work on regularity of the Burnside semigroups. The notion of critical pair is also central, but less explicit. (The "closure under reductions" of <ref> [ do Lago, 1992 ] </ref> , for example, is exactly closure under critical pair generation.) There are many other questions about semigroups (let alone richer algebraic structures) to which rewriting techniques have been applied.

Other applications of rewriting to the investigation of semigroups includes the use of ordered completion|and the introduction of new operators|by Pedersen [ 1989 ] to construct new decision procedures for some one-relation monoids. Decidability for one-relation Burnside varieties has not been investigated.
