Reference-contexts: This situation persists despite a now general acceptance that action and perception should be considered jointly, as a part of an ongoing cycle of agent-environment interaction, <ref> (Ballard, 1991) </ref>. What an agent is perceiving, or `attending to', is likely to strongly influence what behaviour is appropriate.

Reference-contexts: Instead, a scheme based on the coherence between continuous and concurrent sensorimotor processes (or links) is recommended. This scheme is inspired by (Braiten-berg, 1984), and has already been shown to be viable by <ref> (Lambrinos and Scheier, 1995) </ref>, see also (Scheier and Pfeifer, 1995), (Steels, 1994). A novel methodology is adopted in this paper, in which artificial evolution is used to shape the activation function employed by the sensorimotor links. <p> The control of multiple behaviours is best understood in terms of the coherence of autonomous, and continuously active, sensorimotor links, or processes 3 . Action selection (and selective attention) are misleading interpretations of the general problem of coherence between these processes. <ref> (Lambrinos and Scheier, 1995) </ref> propose a similar perspective, and describe an experiment in which a Khepera mobile robot is able to achieve a successful balance between collecting pegs, bringing the pegs to a `home base', and periodically visiting a `charging area'. <p> Second, the use of artificial evolution to design the sensorimotor processes allows the distinction between behaviour and mechanism to be rendered completely explicit. In <ref> (Lambrinos and Scheier, 1995) </ref>, the reliance on hand-coding requires the artificial separation of the problems of process design (what each individual process should do) and process fusion (how to combine these processes to deliver coherent be-haviour).

Reference-contexts: This can be a very valuable perspective, but its value, in ethology, is tempered by the way in which much ethological theory generally assumes that entire behaviours have internal correlates. For example (Tinbergen, 1950), (see also <ref> (Lorenz, 1985) </ref>), pro posed an early solution to the AS problem in terms of a hierarchy of `behaviour centres', animated by the flow of some unspecified `activation energy'. In each case, these `behaviours', such as feeding, fighting, and so on, were clearly assumed to have direct internal correlates.

Reference-contexts: However, the constituents of his hierarchy are still entire be-haviours, such as `avoid hazard' and `find food'. In a different example, <ref> (Maes, 1991) </ref> argues that `be-haviour selection emerges in a distributed fashion by parallel local interactions among the behaviours and between behaviours and environment'. Whilst Maes brings to light the importance of agent-environment interactions, she too works from the assumption that behaviours can be parts of agents, instead of agent-environment-observer interactions. <p> Nevertheless, ethological theories certainly have great predictive and comparative value, and have largely underpinned our understanding of behavioural function. hand, is readily accessible. Nevertheless, most AS models do not extend to a satisfying incorporation of perception. In <ref> (Maes, 1991) </ref> perceptual variables are constrained to hold only predicate values. And (Tyrell, 1993) writes : It was decided that the small amount of added realism [from considering the perception of the animat] was not worth the large amount of extra time it would have taken to include 2 . <p> Fig 5 illustrates that with low battery levels, the animat could not avoid the trap, but as the battery level increased, the animat avoided the trap more often. 5 This phenomenon has been termed `varying attention' (see <ref> (Maes, 1991) </ref> for an animat example); when needing food, the animat appears to `pay less attention' to traps. Opportunism. In addition to the instance of opportunism shown in Fig 3, a further controlled experiment was performed.

Reference-contexts: Behaviours, and any apparent selection between be-haviours, should therefore not be explained purely at a behavioural level, but at a more mechanistic level. 2.3 Perceptual Deprivation As <ref> (Maes, 1994) </ref> points out, AS models in general `have a narrow-minded conception of the relationship between perception and action'. This situation persists despite a now general acceptance that action and perception should be considered jointly, as a part of an ongoing cycle of agent-environment interaction, (Ballard, 1991).

Reference-contexts: Animat perception, on the other 1 Of course, ethologists in the field have no direct access to the internal state of the organisms they study, and so, in the past, have had little alternative but to impute arbitrary behavioural primitives (see <ref> (McFarland and Sibly, 1975) </ref>). Nevertheless, ethological theories certainly have great predictive and comparative value, and have largely underpinned our understanding of behavioural function. hand, is readily accessible.

Reference-contexts: Approaches to this problem, both in ethology and in autonomous agents research, generally assume the need for internal arbitration mechanisms to select the most appropriate action or behaviour according to internal and external conditions <ref> (Tinbergen, 1950) </ref>, (Tyrell, 1993).

Reference-contexts: All this is noteworthy since a substantial amount of work in cognitive science still considers selective attention in terms of a `spotlight' designed to mediate between an external reality and an internal world model, with little consideration of the role of action (see, for example, <ref> (Treisman and Gelade, 1980) </ref>) 6 . 6 This argument is in no way meant to invalidate this corpus of work.

Instead, a scheme based on the coherence between continuous and concurrent sensorimotor processes (or links) is recommended. <p> Many recent models of AS employing animats employ the same premises, and concentrate on designing internal architectures for animats which arbitrate between internal correlates of entire behaviours. For example, <ref> (Tyrell, 1993) </ref> extends Tinbergen's fixed, winner-take-all hierarchy of behaviour centres to a `free-flow' hierarchy (one that does not obey a strict winner-take-all rule), demonstrating an improvement in the efficacy of the mediation between behaviours of the animat concerned. <p> Nevertheless, ethological theories certainly have great predictive and comparative value, and have largely underpinned our understanding of behavioural function. hand, is readily accessible.

The purpose of this model is to illustrate how such a minimal architecture can satisfy the requirements generally expected from an AS mechanism. To assess the quality of the model, we consider a list of such requirements, originally collated by <ref> (Tyrell, 1993) </ref>, and expanded by (Werner, 1994) (more comprehensive versions of this list, which is admittedly somewhat arbitrary, can be found in either of these publications). Explicit tests for these properties are performed wherever possible.
