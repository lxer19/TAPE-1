Title: Undergraduate Women in Computer Science: Experience, Motivation and Culture  
Author: Allan Fisher, Jane Margolis and Faye Miller

Abstract: 1 For the past year, we have been studying the experiences of undergraduate women studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, with a specific eye toward understanding the influences and processes whereby they attach themselves to or detach themselves from the field. This report, midway through the two-year project, recaps the goals and methods of the study, reports on our progress and preliminary conclusions, and sketches our plans for the final year and the future beyond this particular project.

Reference-contexts: Women are underrepresented in computer science at CMU and in other higher education institutions across the nation: for example, they receive 18% of the bachelors degrees in CS at the top 12 research departments <ref> [1] </ref>. Since computers and information technology play an increasingly pervasive role in education and careers, this underrepresentation is critical, not only for the women whose potential may go unrealized, but also for a society increasing dependent on the technology.
