Abstract: Efficient storage and retrieval of large multidimensional datasets is an important concern for large-scale scientific computations such as long-running time-dependent simulations which periodically generate snapshots of the state. The main challenge for efficiently handling such datasets is to minimize response time for multidimensional range queries. The grid file is one of the well known access methods for multidimensional and spatial data. We investigate effective and scalable declustering techniques for grid files with the primary goal of minimizing response time and the secondary goal of maximizing the fairness of data distribution. The main contributions of this paper are (1) analytic and experimental evaluation of existing index-based declustering techniques and their extensions for grid files, and (2) development of a proximity-based declustering algorithm called minimax which is experimentally shown to scale and to consistently achieve better response time compared to available algorithms while maintaining perfect disk distribution.

Reference-contexts: The Hilbert curve scheme (HCAM) [3] is based on the idea of space filling curves. A space filling curve visits all points in a d-dimensional space exactly once and never crosses itself <ref> [1] </ref>. It can be used to linearize a set of points (or buckets) in d-dimensional space. The buckets are then assigned to disks in a round robin fashion.

Reference-contexts: This problem is a variant of the well-known Max-Cut problem, which is known to be NP-complete [6]. Several heuristic algorithms have been proposed for the Max-Cut problem and its analogue, the Min-Cut problem. They include Recursive Spectral Bisection [22], Kernighan-Lin partitioning algorithm [11] and similarity-based declustering algorithms <ref> [4, 14] </ref>. Recursive Spectral Bisection is not suitable for this problem since it assumes unit weights on all edges, and there appears to be no obvious way to allow arbitrary edge weights. <p> Degree of data balance: hot.2d by Liu and Shekhar [14] requires no less disk accesses since Kernighan-Lin algorithm is used to find an initial partition. The similarity-based algorithms, minimal spanning tree (MST) and short spanning path (SSP), introduced by Fang et al. <ref> [4] </ref> eliminate the factor p. They attempt to generate partitions that are similar to each other.

Reference-contexts: As shown by our experiments, the actual scalability of FX is even worse than this theorem suggests.

Reference-contexts: However, results presented in the next section indicate that this happens rarely (see Table 2). To complete the description of the algorithm, we need to specify a way to generate the edge weights. We have chosen the proximity index proposed by Kamel and Faloutsos <ref> [10] </ref>. The alternative we considered, Euclidean distance is suitable for point objects that occupy zero area in the problem space but does not capture the distinction among pairs of partially overlapped spatial objects such as grid buckets 1 . 3.2.

In particular, there is no evidence that it will terminate in a polynomial number of passes and, as a result, may require an unacceptably high number of disk accesses for declustering.

Reference-contexts: It has been shown that when the number of disks and the size of each field are power of 2, the set of partial match queries which are optimal for the fieldwise xor scheme is a superset of those for the disk modulo scheme <ref> [12] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: We present an alternative declustering algorithm based on a proximity measure and present simulation-based empirical evidence of its greater scalability on both synthetic and real data sets. We have implemented this scheme on our 16 processor SP-2. Some preliminary results from the experiments on the SP-2 are presented in <ref> [16] </ref>. 2. Index-based Declustering Algorithms Several index-based declustering schemes have been proposed for Cartesian product files which are similar to grid files. In this section, we present extensions of three best-known schemes, disk modulo, fieldwise xor, and Hilbert curve for grid files. <p> We ran experiments with three different values of r: 0:01, 0:05 and 0:1. A total of 1044 experiments were run for each value of r. 2.2.1 Results Due to the limitations of space, we present only a few results and their summaries; details are in <ref> [16] </ref>. In all the results presented in this section, the ratio of query size r was 0.05. The parameter of greatest interest is the number of disks. <p> Table 2 tabulates the number of closest pairs of buckets that are mapped to the same disk by the different algorithms. It shows that this number is rarely above zero for the minimax algorithm for the 120K records stock.3d dataset. A table for the DSMC.3d dataset is in <ref> [16] </ref>. This provides evidence that the algorithm achieves a distribution quite close to optimal. Of the others, DM and FX have a consistent high number of closest pairs mapped to the same disk. SSP achieves the second lowest numbers but rarely achieves zero, in particular for larger datasets. <p> All the results and analysis presented as yet has been concerned with scalability with respect to number of disks, and the query size has been held constant. Performance effects of change in query size are reported in <ref> [16] </ref>. 4. Conclusions and Future Work The minimax algorithm proposed in this paper scales well and consistently achieves a better response time than all the other algorithms (with a few exceptions when the number of disks is small). It also achieves perfect data balance and maximizes disk space utilization. <p> The number of closest pairs assigned to the same disk: stock.3d of evaluating its performance on two large data sets consisting of snapshots from DSMC and MHD respectively, both of which are time-dependent scientific simulations. Some preliminary results were presented in <ref> [16] </ref>. We will continue to work on various access patterns such as particle tracing with larger datasets.

There are 52857 particle records and they are non-uniformly distributed. The x, y and z-coordinates of particles are used as the primary indices.
