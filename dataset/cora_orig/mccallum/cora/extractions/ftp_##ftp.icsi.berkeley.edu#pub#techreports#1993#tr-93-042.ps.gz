Title: Lower Bounds on Complexity of Testing Membership to a Polygon for Algebraic and Randomized Decision Trees  
Author: Dima Grigoriev Marek Karpinski

Abstract: We describe a new method for proving lower bounds for algebraic decision trees. We prove, for the first time, that the minimum depth for arbitrary decision trees for the problem of testing the membership to a polygon with N nodes is (log N). Moreover, we prove that the corresponding lower bound for the randomized decision trees matches the above bound. Finally, we prove that for the algebraic exp-log decision trees (cf. [GSY 93]), the minimum depth is ( p log N). We generalize the last result to the multidimensional case, showing that if an exp-log decision tree tests a membership to a semialgebraic set with a sum of Betti numbers M, then the depth of a tree is at least ( p

Reference-contexts: Introduction A problem of testing membership to a semialgebraic set was considered by many authors see, e.g. <ref> [B 83] </ref>, [BLY 92], [BL 92], [Y 93], [MH 84], [MH 85], [YR 80] and the references there). Here we consider a problem of testing membership to a polygon (with N nodes). <p> The main tool for proving complexity lower bounds for algebraic computation trees was the number of connected components of a tested set or of its complement, introduced in <ref> [B 83] </ref>, and this invariant was generalized first to the Euler characteristic ([BLY 92]), then to the sum of Betti numbers in [Y 93]. Also in [BLY 92] another method for linear decision trees was designed based on the minimal number of convex sets necessary to compose a given one. <p> Similarly we obtain a lower bound p log N for testing membership to the polygon with N nodes by an exp-log-tree (corollary 3). At the end we observe (proposition 3) that the known bounds (in the multidimensional case) from <ref> [B 83] </ref>, [Y 93] are valid for exp-log-trees again with weakening them by taking a square root. 2 1 A lower bound on the depth of algebraic trees based on the number of singular points Let S R 2 be a closed semialgebraic set on a plane and let T be <p> exp-log-trees again with weakening them by taking a square root. 2 1 A lower bound on the depth of algebraic trees based on the number of singular points Let S R 2 be a closed semialgebraic set on a plane and let T be an algebraic computation tree (see e.g. <ref> [B 83] </ref>, [Y 93], [MH 84]), which tests a membership problem for S whose boundary @S is a semialgebraic curve.

Reference-contexts: A point v 2 V f is singular if either v is a connected component of V f (i.e. an isolated point) or the multiplicity m (v) is larger than the multiplicities of points of V in a certain neighborhood of v on V f (c.f. <ref> [GKS 93] </ref>). Observe that an isolated point could be treated as singular by the above definition as for the points out of V f their multiplicities equal to zero.

Reference-contexts: Another way to extend the class of the algebraic trees is to add other gate functions in addition to the presented arithmetic ones. An interesting example (which was already considered in <ref> [GSY 93] </ref>), is to add expand log-gates. In [GSY 93] it was shown that adding exp and log does not improve the complexity of computing an algebraic function (under some natural conditions). It is an open question, whether adding exp and log increases the power of algebraic computation trees. <p> Another way to extend the class of the algebraic trees is to add other gate functions in addition to the presented arithmetic ones.
