Abstract: This paper investigates the linear degeneracies of projective structure estimation from line features across three views. We show that the rank of the linear system of equations for recovering the trilinear tensor of three views reduces to 23 (instead of 26) when the scene is a Linear Line Complex (set of lines in space intersecting at a common line). The LLC situation is only linearly degenerate, and one can obtain a unique solution when the admissibility constraints of the tensor are accounted for. The line configuration described by an LLC, rather than being some obscure case, is in fact quite typical. It includes, as a particular example, the case of a camera moving down a hallway in an office environment or down an urban street. Furthermore, an LLC situation may occur as an artifact such as in direct estimation from spatio-temporal derivatives of image brightness. Therefore, an investigation into degeneracies and their remedy is important also in practice.

Reference-contexts: Using robust estimation techniques determine the line correspondences which belong to the LLC and compute the matrix B (see theorem 1). Here one might use a robust version of the 8 point algorithm <ref> [7] </ref>. 2. From the matrix B create the 3 'ghost' tensors: v 1 = (B; 0; 0); v 2 = (0; B; 0) and v 3 = (0; 0; B). 3. <p> We chose N = 28 pairs of points which defined lines all belonging to the LLC. These are overlaid as white lines in the figures. For each image pair (1,2), (2,3) and (1,3) we used the 8 point algorithm <ref> [7] </ref> applied to the line correspondences to compute the matrices B 12 , B 23 and B 13 that minimize: E 12 = N i=1 i ) 2 (3) 1 N X (s i B 23 s 00 E 13 = N i=1 i ) 2 respectively. <p> The coordinates of the lines s; s 0 ; s 00 have been scaled as described in <ref> [7] </ref>. From theorem 1, the left and right null spaces of B 23 (for example) are the projections of the line L in images 2 and 3. The dashed black line in figures (3b), and (3c) show the lines corresponding to the null spaces overlaid on the input images.

Reference-contexts: As we will see the lines in the direction of motion are also degenerate. Finally, an LLC situation occurs also as an artifact in direct estimation of the Tensor from spatio-temporal derivatives of image brightness <ref> [18] </ref>. The spatio-temporal derivatives provide an axis of certainty (a one-dimensional uncertainty) for the location of the matching points in views 1,2 relative to points in the reference view 0.

Reference-contexts: The image resolution was 640 fi 480 pixels . To achieve the results presented here we had to take into account radial lens distortion. Only the first term of radial distortion was used. The radial distortion parameter, K 1 = 6e 7 was found using the method described in <ref> [19] </ref>. We note that that parameter value also minimized the error terms in equation 3. (a) (b) Fig. 3. The three input images used. All the lines marked are part of a linear line complex. They all intersect the line defined by the edge of the cube.

Reference-contexts: An LLC includes in particular the case of lines on parallel planes whose degeneracy was observed in <ref> [21] </ref>. To appreciate the practical importance of investigating LLC configurations, consider a few typical outdoor and indoor scene examples depicted in Fig.1. In Fig.1a the common intersecting line is the edge of the building.
