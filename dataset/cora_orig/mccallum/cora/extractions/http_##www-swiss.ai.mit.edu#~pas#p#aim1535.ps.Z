Reference-contexts: Approximate physical models of flue pipes have been developed over the years which work well in certain cases, but not always, and the assumptions behind the models are not fully understood (Hirschberg <ref> [1] </ref>, Verge [2] and references therein). In this paper, a soprano recorder is simulated using the compressible Navier Stokes equations. As far as we know, these are the first simulations of flue pipes using the compressible Navier Stokes equations to be presented (also see Hirschberg [1]). <p> are not fully understood (Hirschberg <ref> [1] </ref>, Verge [2] and references therein). In this paper, a soprano recorder is simulated using the compressible Navier Stokes equations. As far as we know, these are the first simulations of flue pipes using the compressible Navier Stokes equations to be presented (also see Hirschberg [1]). Further, the predictions of the simulations are compared against physical measurements of the acoustic signal generated by the recorder at different blowing speeds. The comparison is encouraging and points towards ways of improving the simulations.

Reference-contexts: The comparison is encouraging and points towards ways of improving the simulations. Some of the difficulties of simulating subsonic hydrodynamics with acoustic waves are summarized in Hardin <ref> [3] </ref>. Most importantly, one must choose the time step of integration very small in order to follow the fast-moving acoustic waves. Second, one must control the slow-growing numerical instabilities which arise in simulations of subsonic flow.

Reference-contexts: Subsequently, we present representative results from the simulations of the recorder, and a comparison with physical measurements of the acoustic signal generated by the recorder. Finally, we comment on our results and on future directions. 2. PHYSICAL MODEL The flow of air is modeled using the adiabatic approximation <ref> [4] </ref> so that the fluctuations of pressure are proportional to the fluctuations of density times the square of the speed of sound. <p> Further, a parabolic velocity profile is imposed both at the outlet and the inlet. These boundary conditions are overconstrained; however, they do not cause any problems in the discrete numerical system (see <ref> [4] </ref>). They are used to prevent the reflection of acoustic waves. Regarding the initial blowing of air into the flue channel, it is chosen to rise smoothly to a final steady value. <p> NUMERICAL METHODS The Navier Stokes equations are solved numerically using a uniform grid and two different explicit numerical methods: the lattice Boltzmann method and a traditional finite difference method <ref> [4, 5] </ref>. The simulation results obtained with the lattice Boltzmann method and the finite difference method are very similar to each other; and for the sake of brevity, only the lattice Boltzmann simulations are presented here. <p> A fourth-order artificial viscosity filter is used in combination with the numerical methods in order to control slow-growing nonlinear instabilities <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. The filter does not alter the fluid dynamics at long wavelengths, but provides a small amount of additional dissipation at short wavelengths comparable to the grid spacing. <p> Each integration step takes about 1 s of runtime, and a typical simulation of 150000 integration steps lasts approxi mately 2 days. 4. RESULTS which is used in the simulations. The real recorder is cylindrical and looks like figure 7 when sliced vertically <ref> [4] </ref>. The recorder is 20 cm long and is closed at the far end. Thus, the recorder behaves as an open-closed pipe with major frequencies in odd ratios 1 : 3 : 5 etc.

Reference-contexts: A fourth-order artificial viscosity filter is used in combination with the numerical methods in order to control slow-growing nonlinear instabilities <ref> [4, 6] </ref>. The filter does not alter the fluid dynamics at long wavelengths, but provides a small amount of additional dissipation at short wavelengths comparable to the grid spacing. <p> In the present simulations, the spatial resolution is x = 0:01 cm so that 10 fluid nodes fit along the width of the flue channel. About 0:8 million fluid nodes are used in the simulation, and they are computed in parallel by 22 non-dedicated Hewlett-Packard HP9000/715 workstations (see <ref> [6] </ref>). The time step is t = 2:17 fi 10 7 s so that about 150000 integration steps are needed to produce about 32 ms of simulated time.
