Abstract: Hybrid systems combine differential equations with discrete event systems. We consider the reachability problem: is there a trajectory from an initial state to a target state in the hybrid system. We show that for hybrid systems with decoupled differential inclusions, the reachability problem can be decided in a finite number of steps.

Each location is labeled with a differential inclusion, and every edge is labeled with a guard, and a jump or reset relation.

Reference-contexts: Hybrid systems in which a problem can be solved algorithmically in a finite number of steps are called decidable hybrid systems. We consider the reachability problem: is there a trajectory from an initial state s 0 to a target state.

The jump relation either leaves the value of the clock unchanged, or sets the clock nondeterministically to a 10 value in an interval. Figure 4 is an example of a timed automaton. We review the work in <ref> [2] </ref> in which it was shown that timed automata have a time-symmetric bisimulation with a finite number of congruence classes. Consider a timed automaton T = (L; E) with state space Q T .

Reference-contexts: To analyze systems with more complicated dynamics, we use abstractions <ref> [7] </ref>. A system which has complicated continuous dynamics is abstracted with one which has simpler dynamics, such as rectangular inclusions. The abstractions are conservative approximations. Hence, any property we prove for the abstraction always holds for the original system.
