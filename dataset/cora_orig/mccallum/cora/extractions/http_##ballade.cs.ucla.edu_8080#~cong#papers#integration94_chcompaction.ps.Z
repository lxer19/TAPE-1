Abstract: In this paper, we present several powerful techniques which allow us to generate efficiently channel routing solutions which are beneficial to further compaction. Our techniques can be applied to straight track compaction as well as to contour routing compaction, and produce very encouraging results. In particular, for Deutsch's Difficult Example, we obtained a straight track routing solution whose area is 7% less than the best known result after straight track compaction. Our router also generated a routing solution which leads to a very satisfactory result after contour routing compaction.

It is possible that the results quoted above can be further improved by using a more intelligent channel compactor.

From the experimental results of different channel compactors, it was observed that the area reduction is closely related to the grid-based routing solutions we applied. For example, as reported in <ref> [De85] </ref>, the same contour channel compaction algorithm was applied to three optimal 19-track grid-based routing solutions of Deutsch's Difficult Example. Three different results were obtained. <p> Three different results were obtained. Since all grid-based channel routers were designed to minimize the number of tracks used and do not take the later compaction step into account, it becomes an important problem for channel routing compaction, as raised in <ref> [De85] </ref> and [XiKu87], to obtain more compactable channel routing solutions. <p> In this paper, we show how to obtain more compactable routing solutions for straight track compaction and more compactable routing solutions for contour track compaction. We use the same set of design rules as presented in <ref> [De85] </ref>: path width 1.0 feature separation 1.0 size of via 2.0 2.0 terminal spacing 4.0 This makes comparisons with other compaction results easier by using the same set of design rules. The methods presented in this paper are design rule independent. <p> Furthermore, if we allow via offset, we can even reduce the track spacing when there are adjacent vias between two track. For example, if we can shift vias up or down by 0.1 as in <ref> [De85] </ref>, we may reduce the track spacing between two tracks to 2.8 even if adjacent vias exist between these two tracks (Fig. 3-1 (c)). Clearly, existence of adjacent vias in the grid-based routing solution increases the channel height and make routing geometry more complicated after straight track compaction. <p> For each track, we assign wires and vias on the track to the lowest possible position. Since we do not have to keep distance between two tracks equal, adjacent vias are no longer the critical consideration. However, the phenomenon shown in Fig. 4-1, referred to as "bump propagation" in <ref> [De85] </ref> may affect the final compacted result. Without loss of generality, assume that we compact the channel from bottom to top. Then, a via on a track near the bottom of the channel may cause adjacent tracks to jog around it and propagate all the way up to the top. <p> Thus, after straight track compaction, we achieved the minimum channel height using uniform track spacing. For Deutsch's Difficult Example, we obtained two routing solutions. Both have a smaller channel height than the best reported result (of height 54.6 <ref> [De85] </ref>) based on the same set of design rules after straight track compaction. The first one has 4 conflicting track pairs, and its channel height is 7% smaller than the best reported result after straight track compaction with variable track spacing and via offset. <p> Our2 is based on the 20-track solution by Yoshimura and Kuh [YoKu82], the channel height of Our2 after compaction is 44.0. Our3 is based on the 19-track solution by Deutsch <ref> [De85] </ref>, the channel height of Our3 after compaction is 43.0. The emphasis of our work is to generate more compactable grid-based channel solutions. The compaction step is carried out by a straight forward one dimensional channel compactor. <p> It is possible that the results quoted above can be further improved by using a more intelligent channel compactor. In [ChDe88], a more sophisticated channel compactor was presented, in which both via minimization and via shifting in horizontal direction are applied. The channel height of the routing solution in <ref> [De85] </ref> after compaction is 42.0. Running time of our program for contour channel routing is less than 12 CPU minutes on all the tested examples. 6.

Reference-contexts: Thus, the problem of finding a valid track permutation of S with the minimum bump propagation is equivalent to the problem of finding a job sequencing of I with the minimum weighted completion time. ` This sequencing problem has been proved to be NP-Complete <ref> [La78] </ref>. However, we can show that in our case for most of the problems, the number of tasks is small (since it is equal to the number of tracks in the routing solution, usually it is no more than 50).

Reference-contexts: A further study [De85] showed that the routing solutions of these grid-based router could be compacted to obtain a 15% - 20% area reduction. Both straight track compaction [De85, WoLi86, Ch86] and contour routing compaction <ref> [De85, XiKu87, Ro87, ChDe88] </ref> have been investigated. Usually these compaction algorithms are used as a post-processing step after the grid-based routing solution has been generated. From the experimental results of different channel compactors, it was observed that the area reduction is closely related to the grid-based routing solutions we applied. <p> Three different results were obtained. Since all grid-based channel routers were designed to minimize the number of tracks used and do not take the later compaction step into account, it becomes an important problem for channel routing compaction, as raised in [De85] and <ref> [XiKu87] </ref>, to obtain more compactable channel routing solutions.

Reference-contexts: The two-layer grid-based channel routing problem has been well formulated and studied extensively. There are several grid-based channel routers which can consistently produce channel routing solutions which are at most one or two tracks within optimal solutions <ref> [De76, YoKu82, RiFi82, BuPe83, ReSS85] </ref>. A further study [De85] showed that the routing solutions of these grid-based router could be compacted to obtain a 15% - 20% area reduction. Both straight track compaction [De85, WoLi86, Ch86] and contour routing compaction [De85, XiKu87, Ro87, ChDe88] have been investigated. <p> Our programs are written in the Pascal language running under Unix 4.3BSD on a Pyramid machine. Table 5-1 shows the routing solutions we obtained for straight track compaction. YK3a, YK3b and YK3c are examples 3a, 3b and 3c, respectively in Yoshimura and Kuh's paper <ref> [YoKu82] </ref>. D1, D3 and D5 are from the GTE Layout published in [De76]. Diff is the famous Deutsch's Difficult Example. Our router removed all the adjacent vias without inserting empty tracks for all the examples except Deutsch's Difficult Example. <p> Our2 is based on the 20-track solution by Yoshimura and Kuh <ref> [YoKu82] </ref>, the channel height of Our2 after compaction is 44.0. Our3 is based on the 19-track solution by Deutsch [De85], the channel height of Our3 after compaction is 43.0. The emphasis of our work is to generate more compactable grid-based channel solutions. <p> We thank Ron Libeskind-Hadas for his helpful comments on the original manuscript.
