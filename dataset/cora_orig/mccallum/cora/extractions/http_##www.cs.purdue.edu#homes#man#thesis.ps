Title: An Evaluation of Transmitting Compressed Images in a Wide Area Network  
Author: Melliyal Annamalai and Bharat Bhargava 
Abstract: Retrieving large data objects (of the order of hundreds of thousands of kilobytes) in a wide area network such as the Internet takes several seconds and occasionally minutes. As a step towards reducing response time we have studied the possibility of reducing the size of the data object by "losing" some of the data and then retrieving it. We have focussed on transmission of images across a wide area network. Images are amenable to losing data without losing the semantics of the image. Lossy compression techniques result in a smaller size, lower quality image. We have studied how the quality of the image can be sacrificed to achieve higher speed in retrieval over a wide area network. We have identified parameters involved in the retrieval process and conducted experiments to see how they can be varied to speed up retrieval. We have developed a scheme to reduce response time at the expense of the quality of the object depending on the current values of the parameters.

Reference-contexts: At any time during this transmission, the user can abort the session. Examples show that the user may be able to make that decision after only 2% of the image has been received. 2.3 Image Rendering by Adaptive Refinement The objective of the work by Bergman et al <ref> [1] </ref> is also to convey as much information to the user as soon as possible. But the method is different and focusses on the use rendering procedure.

Reference-contexts: Techniques Image compression can be defined as a method which maps an original image raster into a bit stream suitable for communication over or storage in a digital medium so that the number of bits required to represent the coded image is smaller than that required for the original image <ref> [2] </ref>. Image compression techniques aim at minimizing storage space and/or communication time. We are concerned with how communication time can be minimized using image compression. Compressed images can be squeezed into smaller bandwidth and one can have more video channels on fiber networks [2]. <p> than that required for the original image <ref> [2] </ref>. Image compression techniques aim at minimizing storage space and/or communication time. We are concerned with how communication time can be minimized using image compression. Compressed images can be squeezed into smaller bandwidth and one can have more video channels on fiber networks [2]. Some compression techniques allow progressive transmission, providing increasing good images starting from a coarse image and improving it as new bits arrive. This is very useful for browsing. <p> There are two basic types of compression: lossless and lossy compression. In lossless compression, the original image can be perfectly recovered from the compressed representation <ref> [2] </ref>. Compression ratios rarely cross 4:1 [2]. In lossy compression, the original pixel intensities cannot be perfectly recovered. Lossy compression techniques attempt to remove redundant information. Typical compression ratios range from 4:1 to 32:1 [2]. Higher compression ratio leads to a higher reduction in communication time. <p> There are two basic types of compression: lossless and lossy compression.

Reference-contexts: The decoder initializes device setup parameters, loads the color table, reads in data files, and displays the image. 3.2 JPEG Image Compression Technique JPEG is a standardized image compression mechanism <ref> [3] </ref>. JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard. JPEG is designed for compressing either full-color or gray-scale images of natural, real-world scenes. <p> It is a new, complete image in itself and can replace the old lower quality display but cannot add to it. Progressive JPEG techniques are expected to make an appearance very soon <ref> [3] </ref>. 3.4 Image Compression Techniques Image compression can be defined as a method which maps an original image raster into a bit stream suitable for communication over or storage in a digital medium so that the number of bits required to represent the coded image is smaller than that required for <p> Different compression techniques are suitable for different images depending on the kind of the information the image contains. As described in Chapter 3, JPEG works well on some material like photographs, naturalistic artwork, and but not so well on certain other material like lettering, simple cartoons, or line drawings <ref> [3] </ref>. GIF is better for such images and often compresses them more than JPEG can. Even in one compression scheme, some images compress better than others - i.e; they can lose more pixel information without losing semantic information. <p> In general, GIF files are quicker to display than image files <ref> [3] </ref> because of a simpler decoding algorithm.

Reference-contexts: This scheme was later extended by Hill et al for rich imagery found in remote sensing applications <ref> [4] </ref>. The approach is based on sending coarse information first, to inform the user early in the reception phase about the general nature of the image.

Images are encoded so that during transmission the entire display shows a rough 2 version of the image in `fat pixels' [4]. If the user wishes to see more detail, additional data is sent and used to refine these pixels, until the exact original image is seen. At any time during this transmission, the user can abort the session. <p> If a lower resolution data object is used, then quality is being traded off for response time. Several researchers have come up with progressive techniques where the image is transmitted step by step <ref> [4] </ref>. The data sent in each step enhances the data sent in the previous step.

Reference-contexts: The team is working on improving the rate at which large digital images can be transferred across the network. 3 Image Formats There are a wide variety of image file formats in use now for image processing application <ref> [5] </ref>. Choosing a particular format for a given application generally involves several interdependent considerations: quality, flexibility, computation, storage, transmission efficiency, and support by existing programs. Some formats like vector-based ones are efficient with respect to storage but require additional computing power and software development to encode and decode [5]. <p> processing application <ref> [5] </ref>.

It applies compression to color data expressed as luminance (brightness) and chrominance.

Reference-contexts: The reduced file size leads to a decrease in the response time. We have studied the factors involved in reducing the quality of the image and reducing response time. We studied large data objects containing images in the context of a multi-resolution data model as the one proposed by <ref> [7] </ref>. Images can be stored, manipulated and viewed in multiple resolutions. Images are rich in semantic content and careful manipulation of the image will result in an image so that no visible information lost.

Reference-contexts: Depending on the nature of image, we can assign attributes to the image and these attributes can determine the amount of compression the image can tolerate, which format is suitable and whether greyscale is adequate. 6 4.1.3 Time of Day Internet traffic varies very much with the time of day <ref> [9] </ref>. Traffic at night is less and a user retrieving images at that time, might be able to get the full size high quality image with an acceptable delay. <p> We wanted to measure precisely the time taken since that would give us a measure of how much time we are saving when a lower quality image file (and hence smaller size) is used. 4.4.2 Procedure It is very difficult to have computer accounts in more than one administrative domain <ref> [9] </ref>. Computer accounts are mostly restricted to ones organization and that will be in one geographical location. We needed to conduct experiments across the Internet. Since we do not have an account on the remote computer, we cannot receive data objects and record timestamp information.
