Abstract: In this paper a brief discussion of h-type v o l u m e i n t e g r a l f o r m u l a t i o n s i m p l e m e n t e d i n GFUNET/CORAL code is given and solutions of TEAM benchmark #13 are shown. GFUNET/CORAL is a general purpose code for 2D and 3D magnetostatics. Solutions of TEAM problem #13 are computed using both a sequential and parallel version of GFUNET/CORAL. We set up the system of equations in two different ways. In the first case, we approximate H m and H s in W In the other case, H m due to M w stands as it is and we N e H s dv . significant difference in the results. The integral equation Combining edge elements (Whitney elements of order p = 1 ) with integral equations in order to solve magnetostatic problems leads to a question of how to define an independent set of equations. The problem is related to the fact that (in a simply-connected region) H is a gradient field and it should be approximated in a subset of W 1 , i.e. in ker(W 1 ) for which all the closed line integrals vanish. An independent set of equations is found by forming a tree from the graph of all edges in the mesh. A tree connects all the nodes in the mesh (in each distinct region) without forming any loops. Hence, coefficients of the co-tree edges can be uniquely defined once a tree is set, because the sum of the coefficients must be zero around any closed loop in the mesh. (The co-tree/tree separation was introduced by Albanese and Rubinacci [2] in order to define flux across surfaces co-tree edges enclose. ) Once a tree is chosen, one can define an incidence matrix G, elements of which are all -1, 0, or 1 [3]. G is a k x n rectangular matrix, where k is the number of edges in matrix can also be symmetrized, if both sides of eqs. (2)
