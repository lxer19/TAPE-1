Reference-contexts: They conjectured this result to be true for every fixed t and r, with 1 &lt; t &lt; r and v ! 1. Progress on this conjecture was incremental (see <ref> [4, 25] </ref>) until it was proved by V. Rodl in the early 1980's (see also J.

The latter term is used for these distributions in statistical physics (see, e.g., <ref> [5] </ref>), where the values (E) are often called activities.

Reference-contexts: It is natural to try to characterize the marginals f for which there exists a normal distribution p on M. Such a characterization was given recently by Rabinovich et al.

Reference-contexts: Furedi's comprehensive survey [9, x8] also provides more details than we give here.

Reference-contexts: An overview of the author's dissertation [21], this paper presents an asymptotic connection between an integer-valued and a related fractional parameter for a natural class of hypergraphs. The result substantially generalizes work of V. Rodl [29], P. Frankl and Rodl <ref> [8] </ref>, N. Pippenger (unpublished; see [27]), and J.

Reference-contexts: At any rate, the problem of understanding the differences between integral and fractional optima has fueled many research fires. Within discrete mathematics, this problem is certainly of fundamental importance in the theory of hypergraphs. As observed e.g. in <ref> [9] </ref>, hypergraphs are such general objects that virtually every combinatorial problem can be phrased using their language.

Reference-contexts: This raises the question: what separates these types of problems? An argument could even be made that better understanding of questions like this may be one of the keys to understanding the "P ? 6= N P" question in theoretical computer science (see <ref> [10] </ref>). At any rate, the problem of understanding the differences between integral and fractional optima has fueled many research fires.

Reference-contexts: Heilmann and E.H. Lieb [12, 13].

It is natural to try to characterize the marginals f for which there exists a normal distribution p on M.

Reference-contexts: In one direction, Pippenger and Spencer [27] proved that the hypotheses (3) and (4) of Theorem 1.2 actually guarantee that the obvious relationship between 0 (H) and D (H), namely that 0 (H) D (H), is asymptotically tight. Their result was further generalized by Kahn <ref> [16] </ref>, who replaced 0 (H) by 0 ` (H). We now turn to the other branch of developments, the one extended in [21].

Kahn [17] also proved an analogous result for matchings, but it is interesting to note that both parts of Theorem 1.2 may be recovered from Theorem 1.3 alone. A routine exercise shows that taking t : H ! R + to be identically 1=d gives the cover portion of Theorem 1.2.

Pippenger simplified the conditions and proved the following result, unpublished by him, but appearing in [34] and [9]. The version we state here was given by Pippenger and Spencer in <ref> [27] </ref>. (1.2) Theorem Let k 2 be fixed and H a k-uniform hypergraph satisfying D (H) d (x) &lt; o (D (H)) for all vertices x; (3) and d (x; y) &lt; o (D (H)) for all distinct vertices x; y: (4) Then -(H) ~ k - 4 - Pippenger's improvement <p> The latter result forms a branching point in the path of generalizations discussed so far. In one direction, Pippenger and Spencer <ref> [27] </ref> proved that the hypotheses (3) and (4) of Theorem 1.2 actually guarantee that the obvious relationship between 0 (H) and D (H), namely that 0 (H) D (H), is asymptotically tight. Their result was further generalized by Kahn [16], who replaced 0 (H) by 0 ` (H). <p> A routine exercise shows that taking t : H ! R + to be identically 1=d gives the cover portion of Theorem 1.2. The equivalence of the two asymptotic statements ~ n=k and - ~ n=k, noted in <ref> [27] </ref>, then gives the matching portion of Theorem 1.2. Summary The implications between the results discussed above are summarized in the following dia gram. implications ([27]) (= ([16]) (1.1) (= ([8]) (= (1.2) (= (1.3) The main result of [21] further generalizes Theorem 1.3. 1.4 Outline We devote x2 to stating

Reference-contexts: This rather unfortunate choice of terminology is inherited from its connection with genetic algorithms, where the term normal population arises; see, e.g., <ref> [28] </ref>. Some authors early to consider normal distributions were H. Kunz [24], and O.J. Heilmann and E.H. Lieb [12, 13]. Each of these papers considered properties of normal distributions connected with the so-called matching polynomial of a graph and approached the subject from the point of view of theoretical physics. <p> It is natural to try to characterize the marginals f for which there exists a normal distribution p on M. Such a characterization was given recently by Rabinovich et al. <ref> [28] </ref> and is a generalization of Edmonds' matching polytope theorem [6]. (3.1) Theorem ([28]) There exists a normal distribution on M with marginals f if and only if the following inequalities hold for all x 2 V and all W V : X f (F ) &lt; 1 and F W

Reference-contexts: An overview of the author's dissertation [21], this paper presents an asymptotic connection between an integer-valued and a related fractional parameter for a natural class of hypergraphs. The result substantially generalizes work of V. Rodl <ref> [29] </ref>, P. Frankl and Rodl [8], N. Pippenger (unpublished; see [27]), and J. Kahn [17] and settles a 1991 conjecture of the last author (see [15] and also [14]).

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction 1.1 Integral v. fractional optima One of the fundamental and most important problems in combinatorial theory is to understand the nature of and differences between integral optima and their fractional counterparts (see, e.g., <ref> [31] </ref>). The latter are generally well-understood in theory, and in practice their determination is considered a tractable problem. The same cannot be said of the former, as "combinatorial explosion" frequently makes their determination possible only by resorting to prohibitively-long exhaustive searches.

The same cannot be said of the former, as "combinatorial explosion" frequently makes their determination possible only by resorting to prohibitively-long exhaustive searches. Witness the contrast between linear and integer programming (see <ref> [32] </ref>). The theory of linear programming is understood to the point where several polynomial-time algorithms are known, and even a famous non-polynomial algorithm, the simplex method, is usually very efficient. In contrast, no efficient algorithm is known for integer programming, and none are thought to exist.

First, P. Frankl and Rodl [8] gave sufficient conditions on a k-uniform hypergraph with n vertices to ensure that the inequalities (2) are asymptotically tight. <p> First, P.
