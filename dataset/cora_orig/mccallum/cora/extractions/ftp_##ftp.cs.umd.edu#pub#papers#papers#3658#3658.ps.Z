Abstract: We propose a simple cell scheduling mechanism for ATM networks. The proposed mechanism, named Carry-Over Round Robin (CORR), is an extension of weighted round robin scheduling. We show that albeit its simplicity, CORR achieves tight bounds on end-to-end delay and near perfect fairness. Using a variety of video traffic traces we show that CORR often outperforms some of the more complex scheduling disciplines such as Packet-by-Packet Generalized Processor Sharing (PGPS).

Reference-contexts: This is a tricky and time consuming process (we use 21 used for CORR. Only one shaper is used for other scheduling disciplines. buffers. linear programming techniques) and requires a full scan of the entire traffic trace for each source. For a description of this procedure please refer to <ref> [9] </ref>. We have plotted the ratio of the number of connections admitted by CORR used in conjunction with single and dual leaky bucket shapers with that of PGPS under this best case scenario.

Reference-contexts: Another important difference between CORR and frame based schemes, such as SG and HRR is that CORR is a work conserving service discipline. It does not waste the spare capacity of the system, rather share it fairly among active connections.

However, the algorithm proposed in [10] has not been analyzed for delay and other related performance metrics. We have presented detailed analysis of CORR and derived tight bounds on end-to-end delay. <p> It does not waste the spare capacity of the system, rather share it fairly among active connections.
