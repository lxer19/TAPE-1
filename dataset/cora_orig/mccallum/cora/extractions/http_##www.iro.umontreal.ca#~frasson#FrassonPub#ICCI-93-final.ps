Abstract: We propose, in this article, a general model of memory that shows how the content of the memory evolves according to the flow of knowledge. The main issues of the model are based on parallel propagation of knowledge into memory, similarity processing and vocabulary-based mode of representation. The model is independent of the type and description mode of the knowledge to integrate into memory. It supposes, however, that two knowledge elements (situations) can be compared. We define such a comparison operation and illustrate its use for some representation modes. In particular, we consider the representation of knowledge with conceptual graphs (CG) and compound CG. The model of memory is a main component of a multi-strategy learning environment which is itself a part of a Knowledge Manipulation System based on CG theory. The system will serve as a framework of an Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and a Multi-Agents System (MAS). It can be used also for creating a generalization graph of any inheritance based system.

Reference-contexts: Kaufman, Michalski and Kerschberg (Kaufman, Michalski and Kerschberg, 1991) integrate, in a large system, databases, knowledge bases and several learning methods in order to allow retrieving knowledge from database. Finally, a great importance is recently devoted to multi-strategy learning systems <ref> (Birnbaum and Collins, 1991) </ref> which integrate several learning strategies (induction, generalization, explanation, abduction and analogy based learning) to deal with real-world learning problems. <p> There is a need for developing a framework that supports these complementary strategies. This trends leads to a multi-strategy learning environment <ref> (Birnbaum and Collins, 1991) </ref>. In fact, understanding a situation implies the activation of several reasoning processes : induction, generalization, deduction, explanation, analogy and abduction. They correspond to different interpretations of the content of memory and different learning strategies.

Reference-contexts: Some nodes in memory contain "generic" knowledge represented by rules. If a situation S/s is propagated to a node which contains a rule (t -&gt; q) then we compare s and t : if t is included in s then we replace t by q in s <ref> (Collins and Michalski , 1989) </ref>. In abductive reasoning, if c is included in s, then q is replaced by t in s. memory and transfer the knowledge of connected situations (indicated on figure 6.b by curved arrows). <p> Notice that the same part of a situation can be involved in several rules. These multiple increase correspond to "reasoning lines " which can be 13 opposed or complementary. Collins et Michalski <ref> (Collins et Michalski, 1989) </ref> note that human reasoning is characterized by several reasoning lines that are evaluated. 4- Modifications given to a situation when going through a node including a rule, may have an influence on propagation 5- Rule are not fixed; integrating new situations and rules de nouvelles rgles peut

Reference-contexts: The schemas of a concept can be considered as the sons and other descendants of the node which represent the concept. The present state of our model does not take into account the notion of prototype which would imply a probabilistic view of the notion of concept <ref> (Gennari et al. , 1989) </ref>), but we can consider an extension in which, for instance, a simplified version of a prototype would consist in calculating, for each instance attribute describing the concept, the mean of the values.

Reference-contexts: human memory : if we have to integrate a situation S, we cannot make all the connections with all the nodes in memory but as the memory changes perpetually, it can arrive that following a new integration of the situation S, we could identify similarities that were hidden before (see <ref> (Kabbaj , 1992a) </ref> for more detail). How many times did we exclaim " Oh yes, it's true, I did not notice before!" when we link two situations previously known but without any apparent similarity. <p> A more detailed justification of the transformations mentioned above is given in <ref> (Kabbaj, 1992a) </ref>. We show also the process of optimization which takes place after the integration of a situation S. Basically we eliminate every node O for which the content = nil and with a single father M (different of the root).

Reference-contexts: A situation is a description of : an object, an event, a scene, a planning situation, a procedure, different kinds of rules, a task or a part of a system. A situation can be described by a set, a predicate, a conceptual graph, a network of actors and objects <ref> (Kabbaj, 1992b) </ref> or any formalism of knowledge representation provided that we can define and apply a comparison operation between two situations. A situation may correspond to a new situation or to an existing situation in memory. A situation S, with its description s, will be noted S/s.

Reference-contexts: In a cognitive approach, Schank (Schank, 1982) proposes a general theory of memory structuration in order to incorporate some recall and learning principles. Inspired by this work, Lebowitz (Lebowitz, 1990) and Kolodner <ref> (Kolodner, 1984) </ref> have proposed several programs that implement a memory based on the generalization principle. They have shown its usefulness in understanding, reasoning and planning process, leading to case-based reasoning (Kolodner and Riesbeck, 1986, Riesbeck and Schank, 1989).

Reference-contexts: A framework for a multi-strategy learning environment As noted by Tecuci and Michalski <ref> (Tecuci and Michalski, 1991) </ref>, several researchers in machine learning are currently looking for real-world learning problems and integration of multiple learning strategies (induction, generalization, explanation, abduction and analogy-based learning). There is a need for developing a framework that supports these complementary strategies.
