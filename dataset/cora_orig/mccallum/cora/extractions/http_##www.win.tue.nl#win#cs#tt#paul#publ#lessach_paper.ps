Reference-contexts: The exact start times of beads are chosen after the determination of the time intervals of blocks. 3.11 Other use of blocks Apart from the clustering of resources and beads, blocks can also be used for other purposes. For example, in the execution of the reliable message protocol <ref> [AvdS93] </ref>, many short messages are exchanged between a number of processors. There is a small chance that these messages collide. Therefore it is not considered worthwhile to schedule all these communications in detail.

Reference-contexts: Because of the similarities with the problem of resource-constrained project scheduling, which proves to be NP-complete <ref> [BLK83] </ref>, this general scheduling problem is probably NP-complete, too. Therefore a decomposition of the general problem will be made. This decomposition is partly a logical consequence of the model.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The main purpose of the DEDOS (DEpendable Distributed Operating System) project <ref> [HLL + 94] </ref> is the development of techniques and algorithms for the design of dependable distributed real-time systems. Nowadays, the use of these systems is growing fast, for example in the field of embedded systems. <p> After this, the receiving resource is notified of the presence of the data. In the second stage, the receiving resource reads the data from the mailbox. 3 Dynamic structure The real-time application is described in an object-oriented language, called DEAL (DEDOS Application Language) <ref> [HLL + 94] </ref>[vR94]. The object-oriented development paradigm is chosen for its reusability and extendibility. DEAL provides transparency to the user from hardware aspects such as distribution over the network and communication. DEAL is based on the C++ language because the language is widely used.

Reference-contexts: In principle, this model can be extended for soft real-time scheduling. For this purpose, the notation can be easily extended with value functions. An earlier version of this model is presented in <ref> [Ver95] </ref>. In contrast with that model, replication is part of the current model, apart from other differences in the level of detail. The model presented in this paper will be used in the development of scheduling algorithms for the DEDOS design environment.
