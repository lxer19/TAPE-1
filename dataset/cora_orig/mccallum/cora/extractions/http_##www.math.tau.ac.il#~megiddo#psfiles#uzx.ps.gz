Abstract: The problem of finding a minimum dominating set in a tournament can be solved in njO(log n) time. It is shown that if this problem has a polynomial-time algorithm then for every constant C, there is also a polynomial-time algorithm for the satisfiability problem of boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form with m clauses and C log j2m variables. On the other hand, the problem can be reduced in polynomial time to a general satisfiabilty problem of length L with O(log j2L) variables. Another ration between the satisfiability problem and the minimum dominating set in a tournament says that the former can be solved in 2jO( p z Department of Computer Sciences, School of Mathematical Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel, and Department of Computer Science, Courant Institute, New York University.

Reference-contexts: Proof: In view of Fact 2.5, a minimum dominating set can be found by enumerating all subsets of V of cardinality not greater than dlog 2 ne. There are P i=1 jdlog 2 ne n such subsets and this establishes the proof. P. Erdos <ref> [E] </ref> used the probabilistic method to prove the following fact: Fact 2.5.

Reference-contexts: For instance, Tarjan and Trojanowski [TT] give a search algorithm for finding maximum independent set in a graph in time O (2jv=3), where v is the number of vertices.

A tournament is a directed graph T = (V; E) where every two vertices u; v 2 V are connected by one edge, that is, jE " f (u; v); (v; u)gj = 1. <p> Obviously, S 0 is a dominating set in T . Since the cardinality of S 0 does not exceed that of S, our claim follows. 3.

Reference-contexts: There exists a constant c &gt; 0 such that for every n there exists a tournament T with n vertices such that (T ) &gt; c log n. 4 Graham and Spencer <ref> [GS] </ref> give an explicit construction of tournaments with similar properties as follows.

Reference-contexts: The question is of course related to the density of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions. Proposition 2.9. pj fl (k) = O (2j2kkj2). Proof: The following is taken from Huxley's book <ref> [H] </ref>. Let fl (j) = log p if j = pji where p is prime and i 1, and fl (j) = 0 otherwise. <p> Let (x; d; a) = jx fl (j) : If a and d are relatively prime (in our case a = 3 and d = 4) then (see <ref> [H, p. 72] </ref>) (x; d; a) = '(d) + O (xejc p where '(j) denotes Euler's function (giving the number of integers i &lt; j relatively prime to j), and c is a certain constant.

Reference-contexts: Definition 3.1. We define here the complexity classes SAT log jkn , SAT log jkn jCNF and P log jkn (k &gt; 1) (the definition of the latter is essentially the same as in <ref> [KF] </ref>). (i) A language L is in SAT log jkn if there exists a Turing machine M , a polynomial p (n), and a constant C, such that for every string I of length n, M converts I in p (n) time into a boolean formula I (whose length is necessarily

Reference-contexts: If the edge is (u; v) then we say that u dominates v. For more about tournaments see <ref> [M] </ref>. Definition 2.2. A set S V is dominating in a tournament T = (V; E) if for every v 62 S there exists a u 2 S which dominates v. We are concerned with the following computational problem: Problem 2.3. Minimum dominating set. <p> Obviously, T has property P k if and only if (T ) &gt; k. The following fact is attributed to P. Erdos <ref> [M, p. 28] </ref>. We include the simple proof for completeness. Fact 2.5. If T is a tournament with n vertices (n 2) then (T ) dlog 2 ne. 3 Proof: Let d (u) denote the number of vertices dominated by a vertex u.

Reference-contexts: This equivalence sheds some light on the complexity of finding a minimum dominating set in a tournament. The 2 naive exhaustive search takes O (2jvn) time. There are only few NP-complete problems for which improvements over the naive exhaustive search are known. For instance, Tarjan and Trojanowski <ref> [TT] </ref> give a search algorithm for finding maximum independent set in a graph in time O (2jv=3), where v is the number of vertices. For more examples and discussion, see [GJ, Section 6]. 2. Some properties of tournaments Definition 2.1.
