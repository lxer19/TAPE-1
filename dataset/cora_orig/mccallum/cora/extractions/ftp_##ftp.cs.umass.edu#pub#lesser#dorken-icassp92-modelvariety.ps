Title: Extended Model Variety Analysis for Integrated Processing and Understanding of Signals

Abstract: In this paper, we extend our previous work on model variety analysis of a signal processing algorithm with respect to the class of all input signals that may potentially arise in a given signal understanding application. This analysis has two related objectives. The first objective is to partition the set of all possible signals in the application domain into two sets according to whether each signal is correctly or incorrectly processed by the signal processing algorithm under consideration. The second objective of model variety analysis is to characterize the nature of the distortions in the signal processing output for the cases where the input signal is incorrectly processed. The results of model variety analysis are useful for designing signal understanding systems for applications where it is necessary for the signal processing to be carried out in a situation-dependent manner. Model variety analysis and its usefulness for the design of signal understanding systems are illustrated in this paper through examples involving the use of STFT processing for a sound understanding application.

Reference-contexts: The need for a new type of analysis of signal processing algorithms has been pointed out <ref> [1] </ref> in the context of signal understanding systems that must carry out situation-dependent signal processing. This type of analysis of a signal processing algorithm has been referred to as model variety analysis. <p> We have previously reported <ref> [1, 2] </ref> a relatively simple example of model variety analysis of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) algorithm. We have now extended the scope of that example and in the process we have attempted to establish a methodology for carrying out model variety analysis in general. <p> D) "car passing by", window length is 2048. the capability to first process the signal data with one window-length and then to reprocess the signal data with another window length. A thorough discussion of how this can be practically accomplished is given in <ref> [1] </ref>. 3 Model Variety Analysis In this section we describe our latest results on model variety analysis of the STFT algorithm. These results were obtained by extending the analysis reported in [2]. <p> It should be noted that the data-model of section 3.1 was derived with repect to a larger class of possible input signals than those considered for the data-models in <ref> [1] </ref> and [2]. The reason for this is that in our previous research we were primarily concerned with showing that the set of signals that would be incorrectly processed is non-empty.

Following the procedure detailed in <ref> [2] </ref>, we then derive the data-model for the STFT algorithm with respect to the class of input signals described above. The data-model specifies a set of conditions which the signal generation parameters of any input signal must satisfy in order for the signal to be correctly processed by the STFT. <p> It should be noted that the data-model of section 3.1 was derived with repect to a larger class of possible input signals than those considered for the data-models in [1] and <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: In section 2 we provide some background on why situation-dependent signal processing may be required in some signal understanding applications. In particular, we use the example of a sound understanding application for which we have developed an experimental knowledge-based signal understanding system <ref> [3, 4] </ref>. That system performs STFT signal processing and utilizes the results of the model variety analysis presented in this paper to guide the situation dependent application of STFT algorithms with different analysis-window lengths, fft lengths, and temporal-decimation factors.
