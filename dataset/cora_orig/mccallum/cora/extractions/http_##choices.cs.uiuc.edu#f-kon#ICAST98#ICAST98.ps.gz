Abstract: Digital video and audio multimedia systems will rapidly take the place of existing analog systems in the next millennium's radio and television broadcasts. Current initiatives in digital radio will soon provide near-CD quality radio channels in many countries. However, due to the very nature of their broadcasting architecture, user interactivity and flexibility is limited. We demonstrate an architecture for capturing, distributing, and displaying digital multimedia content through existing Internet and intranet infrastructures using personal computers. Our solution is much more flexible than previous systems, increases the degree of interactivity between the user and the broadcasting system, and opens a new range of possibilities not offered before. The distribution infrastructure supports both live and stored data and enables a flexible combination of different policies and mechanisms. A component-based architecture for the development of customized multimedia clients and servers facilitates software maintenance and updates as application requirements evolve. Moreover, it promotes a large degree of code reuse.

Reference-contexts: Further research is needed to understand the techniques which would have to be applied in order to serve, asynchronously, thousands of different videos to millions of clients on demand. Systems such as Tiger <ref> [BFD97] </ref> and Skyscraper [HS97] address this issue. 8 Conclusions We have presented a flexible and extensible distribution framework for multimedia data. It scales well from a single client/server system to a network of reflectors capable of serving a potentially unlimited number of clients.

Reference-contexts: In the near future, we will experiment with other applications that will use this distribution architecture, including collaborative work and multimedia presentation systems. A related research project in our group is currently investigating operating system <ref> [CKB + 98] </ref> and middleware [SSC97] support for our architecture. 1.1 Contents Section 2 describes the overall system architecture and previous results. Section 3 describes our distribution framework which is composed by the Reflector (section 3.1), the Administration Panel (3.2), and the Directory Service (3.3). <p> We also intend to investigate the adaptation of applications such as collaborative work tools and multimedia presentation systems to work within our distribution infrastructure. A related research project in our group is currently investigating operating system <ref> [CKB + 98] </ref> and middleware [SSC97] support for our architecture.

Reference-contexts: It is also used to update information stored in the Directory Service (see section 3.3) such as the list of channels and their characteristics, list of users known to the system, etc. The communication between the Administration Panel and the reflectors will follow an extension to the SNMPv2 protocol <ref> [CMRW96] </ref> for network management. Reflectors will act as network agents that receive requests for updating their working parameters and requests for returning information about their current state. In case of exceptional behavior, a reflector may send trap notifications back to the Administration Panel.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 describes some of the multimedia clients and servers we have developed as an example of such applications. 2.1 Previous Results Previous work in our research group has led to the design and implementation of protocols and tools for delivering Multimedia data via the Internet <ref> [CTCL95, CTS + 96] </ref> and over low bandwidth connections [TCC + 96]. The Vosaic client was first designed as an extension to the NCSA Mosaic Web browser. The server is a stand-alone application that can serve a large number of stored video clips to hundreds of simultaneous clients. <p> The Vosaic client was first designed as an extension to the NCSA Mosaic Web browser. The server is a stand-alone application that can serve a large number of stored video clips to hundreds of simultaneous clients. The client implements the Video Datagram Protocol (VDP) <ref> [CTCL95] </ref>: it monitors network utilization and CPU congestion, and sends feed-back messages to the server which adapts the video stream by increasing or decreasing the video frame rate. Thus, the system can provide the best video quality without saturating the communication channel or the client CPU. <p> If desired, these modules will be unloaded and discarded when not in use anymore. Another issue we will address is automatic management of network topologies by adaptive protocols. We have developed an adaptive protocol for streaming video <ref> [CTCL95] </ref> to a fixed client/server pair and we plan to incorporate it into the distribution framework.

Our research benefits from and builds on previous work on IP-Multicast <ref> [Dee89] </ref> and the Internet MBone [SRL96]. The MBone is a virtual network that is layered on top of the Internet to support routing of IP-multicast packets. It is composed of islands that can directly support IP-multicast (e.g., multicast LANs connected by multicast-capable routers), linked by virtual point-to-point links called tunnels.

Reference-contexts: Clients get information about available channels in a reflector by using the RTSP [SRL97] and SDP [HJ97] protocols. As described in 3.3, reflectors communicate with the Directory Service using the LDAP protocol. A secure alternative to these protocols will be supported by using Secure Sockets <ref> [EH95] </ref>. 3.1.1 Internal Reflector Architecture We are currently working on a new version of the reflector that is implemented as a highly portable, multi-threaded application which will be working by the time of the conference 1 .

Reference-contexts: Reflector managers can remotely inspect statistics about bandwidth utilization, user accesses, and accounting. Managers can also dynamically reconfigure reflector policies and the distribution network topology. This technology was utilized in the live broadcast of NASA's JPL Pathfinder mission <ref> [GCE + 97] </ref>. During this broadcast which lasted for several months more than one million live video sessions were delivered to dozens of different countries across the globe by a network of reflectors spread across five continents. <p> The frame rate varies depending upon the images being encoded 4 . 5.1 The JPL Mars Pathfinder Broadcast Our technology was later chosen to broadcast, live over the Internet, the coverage of the NASA JPL Mars Pathfinder mission <ref> [GCE + 97] </ref> that landed on Mars on July 4, 1997. A 133MHz Pentium-based PC with an H.263 Osprey encoding card served as the capture station at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Reference-contexts: At the moment, there are a number of different solutions for multimedia streaming and conferencing on the Internet. Although there are other reflector-like systems for multimedia distribution (e.g., White Pine's Meeting-Point <ref> [Hal97] </ref>), not much scientific literature on this topic is available. MeetingPoint, the successor of White Pine's Reflector, is the system that share most similarities with the one described in this paper. It is mainly used for Internet videoconferencing and supports the H.323 standard.

Reference-contexts: The solution was to shut down the web service and to install a new HTTP server that could limit the number of concurrent requests. This episode led to a redesign of the system that enabled the reflectors to serve client applets and limit the bandwidth spent on this task <ref> [KCT + 98] </ref>. During the course of the broadcast, some reconfiguration of the network topology was required in order to accommodate our collaborators' requests. We had to redirect the streams to different primary reflectors and often add or remove public reflectors.

The basic connection stream implements an extended RTSP protocol <ref> [SRL97] </ref> and allows clients to receive information about broadcast and conference channels, conference participants, user information, etc. In addition, our architecture assumes that clients may need to send application-specific requests which will be processed by customized connection streams running within the reflector.

Every time the reflector manager commits a set of updates to the global configuration, the Administration Panel connects to the affected reflectors and sends their new configuration parameters.
