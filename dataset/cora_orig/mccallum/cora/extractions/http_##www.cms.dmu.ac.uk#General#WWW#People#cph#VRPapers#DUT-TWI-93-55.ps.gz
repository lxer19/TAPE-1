Title: The World Processor An Interface for Textual Display and Manipulation in Virtual Reality  
Keyword: Hypertext, Virtual Reality, information visualization, interactive graphics.  
Abstract: We propose a Virtual Reality interface for creating and manipulating textual and hypertextual information. Many current hypertext systems include concept maps in two dimensions. Our system, called the World Processor, offers the user a three-dimensional concept map. It allows the user to move through the map while exploring existing objects and their associated texts and adding new objects and texts. We discuss a number of interface issues raised by three-dimensional hypertext and then describe the World Processor as an attempt to address some of these issues. Of particular interest in the World Processor interface are its point-and-shoot selection technique, its methods for reading and editing text in 3D, its widgets for creating and modifying conceptual objects, and its auditory as well as visual feedback. Possible applications for three-dimensional hypertext include CSCW (particularly collaborative writing) and authoring systems for computer-based training.

Reference-contexts: In these maps the nodes are often represented by labelled boxes and the links by arrows (Figure 1). One such application is Storyspace <ref> [1] </ref>; other systems that provide concept maps include MacWeb [17] and the SEPIA system [23]. However, most current hypertext applications provide only two-dimensional concept maps. In three dimensions, the PARC 3D/Rooms system and the system described by Hemmje offer maps of hierarchical structures and point the way to hypertext.

Reference-contexts: Another important question is whether a tactile interface is appropriate for abstract information. The history of writing in recent centuries has been one of increased abstraction and distancing of the author from the text: through the printing press, the typewriter, and now the word processor and hypertext <ref> [2] </ref>. Does the user want to touch and hold blocks of text as he or she does other objects in virtual reality? Pen-based computing would suggest a return to the tactile quality of handwriting, but we have yet to see how and where pen-based computing will be used.

Reference-contexts: Flying at high speeds, the user can get lost or pass out of the virtual world entirely. This problem can be minimized by limiting the navigable space, for example by constructing a boundary cube. An overview map that indicates the user's position can also help to maintain orientation <ref> [4] </ref>. The 3D hypertextual view can be browsed by following links. Other techniques include text searches and filters. Instead of moving the user from one place to another, such tools could rearrange and change the structure of the document by highlighting occurences, hiding non-relevant clusters, and so on.

Reference-contexts: The environment was presented to the user on a conventional CRT display, and the user could interact with the data using a keyboard and mouse. The Xerox PARC project called 3D/Rooms has extended this concept of spatialization to "information visualization" in general <ref> [5] </ref>. Several new visualization tools and interface techniques have been introduced in this project. So-called "cone trees" display hierarchical information (e.g. a directory structure) [21]; temporal or other linear information can be visualized with the "perspective wall," a three-dimensional timeline [13]. <p> More information can be conveyed, because the human ability to perceive spatial structures reduces the cognitive load. Perception and action are tightly coupled [8]: animation and manipulation of the structure may also augment the user's understanding of the information represented <ref> [5] </ref>. INTERACTING WITH HYPERTEXT IN 3D Hypertext is an information structure in which the user often experiences cognitive overload--the problem of being lost in hyperspace [18]. So three-dimensional representation should improve the display and the manipulation of hypertext.

Reference-contexts: Spatial representation has also been applied to the representation of verbal ideas and text itself. A pioneering application is this area was the SemNet system in 1986 <ref> [6] </ref>. SemNet displayed semantic networks in three dimensions. The semantic network appeared as clusters of cubes and lines that were deployed in a virtual space. The cubes represented nodes of information (each cube had a title floating in front of it); the lines established semantic relationships among cubes.

Reference-contexts: However, there is a long historical tradition of labeling and writing on objects in the world. Clay vessels, stone tablets, the walls and doors of buildings, metal road signs, and so on have all served as spaces for writing <ref> [7] </ref>. There is also a long tradition of locating semantic objects in an imagined space.

Reference-contexts: Such research suggests that three-dimensional representation allows the information space to be both larger and denser. More information can be conveyed, because the human ability to perceive spatial structures reduces the cognitive load. Perception and action are tightly coupled <ref> [8] </ref>: animation and manipulation of the structure may also augment the user's understanding of the information represented [5].

Reference-contexts: A better current solution, we believe, is to use conventional 2D windows and a mouse to interact with the words. Research continues on the use of two-dimensional input devices such as the mouse to manipulate objects in 3D environments <ref> [10] </ref>. Another important question is whether a tactile interface is appropriate for abstract information. The history of writing in recent centuries has been one of increased abstraction and distancing of the author from the text: through the printing press, the typewriter, and now the word processor and hypertext [2].

Reference-contexts: Virtual Reality has already been used in a CSCW system for graphical design [24]. But cooperative work often involves collaborative writing or the sharing and modifying of textual information. Several computer systems offer the collaborators a common workspace in which to sketch, write out, and structure ideas <ref> [11] </ref>. Our interface provides such a space in three dimensions. The whole field of collaborative writing for technical reports and documentation is a potential area for three-dimensional structure mapping.

Reference-contexts: All of these systems focus on the display and exploration of large information spaces. They would be classed as exploratory hypertexts, while in constructive hypertext, the user or reader can modify both structure and text <ref> [12] </ref>. . Our interface is designed to permit the user to modify text and structure, rather than merely explore them. This interface could be employed wherever constructive hypertext is called for. Three-dimensional hypertext would be appropriate for some kinds of CSCW, for example. <p> Three dimensional concept maps should provide a clearer view of this evolving structure. Also, this interface could be used in the teaching of technical and scientific writing. Hypertext systems are now being applied to the teaching of writing <ref> [12, 16] </ref>. The advantage is that the fluid associative structures of hypertext are good for the teaching students to brainstorm and organize ideas.

INTERACTING WITH HYPERTEXT IN 3D Hypertext is an information structure in which the user often experiences cognitive overload--the problem of being lost in hyperspace <ref> [18] </ref>. So three-dimensional representation should improve the display and the manipulation of hypertext. A hypertext can be understood as a collection of nodes connected in a two-, three-, or n-dimensional structure, and some hypertext applications already make this structure visible by allowing the user to build concept maps.

Reference-contexts: Of course, the hardware continues to improve and diversify. For example, a different technology, using stacked monochrome LEDs and a pivoting mirror, can already provide a resolution of 720 by 280 pixels, which should make text more legible <ref> [19] </ref>. We can also expect improvements in helmet-mounted displays with color LEDs.) Furthermore, a 3D cursor is not a very accurate pointing device for selecting text, and the use of a physical keyboard is almost impossible for a helmeted user. <p> We believe that both interface designers and users will come to recognize the importance of representing text and other semantic objects in three-dimensional spaces. Increased computational power is making high quality graphics available on workstations and personal computers, and even Virtual Reality need not be prohibitively expensive <ref> [19] </ref>. We believe that users will begin to feel an increasing need to locate text in the graphic space. The desktop and windows metaphors of current desktop computing will likely be supplemented or replaced with various three-dimensional metaphors.

Reference-contexts: However, grasping structures in space proves to be difficult with the current generation of equipment, mostly due to the small range and the noisiness of the trackers. Smart selection mechanisms (e.g. gravity or prediction algorithms) may help; multimodal input can also aid in selection <ref> [20] </ref>. Furthermore, new tools will have to be developed for multiple selection. The interaction and selection mechanisms of course depend on the mapping of the hypertext as well. For example, the building metaphor makes it hard to select a group of nodes that are scattered around in the building.

The PARC system includes "gardening" tools to "prune" or "grow" its cone trees <ref> [21, p. 5] </ref>. When multiple users have access to the same structure, however, such rearranging can cause confusion, unless some sort of protocol is established for distinguishing between private views and the public space.

Reference-contexts: Wholly new interface concepts may evolve in the coming years. We have already mentioned speech recognition as a future solution; we have also been experimenting with voice annotation as a means of putting verbal information (though not ASCII text) into 3D models <ref> [25] </ref>. We believe that both interface designers and users will come to recognize the importance of representing text and other semantic objects in three-dimensional spaces. Increased computational power is making high quality graphics available on workstations and personal computers, and even Virtual Reality need not be prohibitively expensive [19].

Reference-contexts: Orators in ancient Greece and Rome used spatialization to memorize speeches by a technique called "the art of memory": they remembered each speech as an imaginary walk though a three-dimensional structure, usually a building or a garden <ref> [26] </ref>. Computer graphics, especially three-dimensional graphics and Virtual Reality, provide contemporary technology that can vastly extend the art of memory and help users imagine semantic objects in space. Scientific visualization has already become a recognized discipline for semantic representation in space.
