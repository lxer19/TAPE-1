Reference-contexts: These methods are based on map displays that allow the user to view the distributions of genes on a map at multiple resolutions. Physical-map positions are from the Blattner Genbank entry for the complete genomic sequence of E. coli <ref> [1] </ref>. The unit of measurement for map positions is the centisome (one percent of the length of the E. coli chromosome). <p> Look in the window in which you first started the EcoCyc program (the window with the Unix shell). If you see something like: Restart actions (select using :continue): 0: Return to EcoCyc command level 1: EcoCyc top level 2: Exit EcoCyc [changing package from "USER" to "ECOCYC"] <ref> [1] </ref> EC (3): it means that some sort of error has occurred. EcoCyc is in a state called a "break," and you are interacting with the Lisp debugger.

Reference-contexts: For example, some EcoCyc polypeptides are linked to both SwissProt entries and to PDB entries; some EcoCyc genes are linked to entries in the Coli Genetic Stock Center database. EcoCyc contains two types of links: unification links and relationship links <ref> [2] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Comments authored by Monica Riley are found in several locations in object displays. In some cases, citations are presented in the same manner as are comments. Consider a line from an enzyme display such as: Inhibitors (allosteric) <ref> [3] </ref>: NADH [4], succinate [2,5] This line is identifying NADH and succinate as allosteric inhibitors of the enzyme being shown. The [4] indicates that the KB contains either a citation or a comment that pertains to the fact that NADH is an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme. <p> Clicking on the "4" will display the comment or citation in a pop-up window or, if the citation is available through Medline, in a Netscape browser window. Analogously, two comments or citations pertain to the role of succinate as activator or inhibitor: [2,5]. The <ref> [3] </ref> is a more general comment or citation about the inhibition of the enzyme that does not pertain precisely to NADH or succinate alone. <p> If the user clicks on the word CoA, however, the full structure of that moiety will be displayed (X-windows version only). 4.4.1 Compound Mode Commands Compound mode can be used to query tRNAs (such as tRNA-trpT) as well as small molecules such as pyruvate, D-glucose, and ATP. 1 See <ref> [3] </ref> for a definition of these terms. 24 CHAPTER 4.

The displays show the EC number for the reaction, and the reaction equation. Note that there exists a one-to-one mapping between EC numbers and reactions, but not between EC numbers and enzymes <ref> [8] </ref>, which is why we label reactions, and not enzymes, with the EC number. The standard change in Gibbs free energy of the reaction is listed when known. <p> The protein window is usually divided into a number of sections to address these complexities. (See <ref> [8] </ref> for details of our representations of enzymes and activators.) The first section of the window lists general properties of the protein, such as synonyms, molecular weight, pI, cellular location, and subunit structure.

Genes are classified according to two systems devised by Riley <ref> [11] </ref>. Compounds and pathways are also classified.

The gene product is listed (when known); when the product is an enzyme known to EcoCyc, the display shows the equation (s) of the reaction (s) catalyzed by the enzyme, and the pathways that contain those reactions. 28 CHAPTER 4. <p> OBJECT DISPLAYS AND QUERIES EcoCyc classifies genes by using two classification systems. The first is based on the physiological role of the gene product (e.g., all genes whose products are involved in tryptophan biosynthesis, including enzymes and regulatory proteins, are in a single category) <ref> [11] </ref>. The second system is coarser, and assigns each gene to one of the following ten product types: Enzyme-Genes, Regulator-Genes, Leader-Genes, Membrane-Genes, Transport-Genes, Structural-Genes, RNA-Genes, Phenotype-Genes, Factor-Genes, Carrier-Genes. <p> The genes to be added can be selected by several criteria: by name (such as hisE); by matching a substring against all gene names (such as "his"); as members of one of the classes of all E. coli genes defined by Riley <ref> [11] </ref> (the classification is based on the function of the gene 36 CHAPTER 4. OBJECT DISPLAYS AND QUERIES products, such as membrane components or tRNAs); or the set of genes coding for enzymes in a chosen biochemical pathway.
