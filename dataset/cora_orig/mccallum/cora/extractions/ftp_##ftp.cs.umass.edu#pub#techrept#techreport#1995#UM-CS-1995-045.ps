Abstract: The THOMAS system is designed to make legislative information available to the general public over the Internet, and can be regarded as a prototype of a government digital library. As a joint project between the Library of Congress and the University of Massachusetts, THOMAS provides significant opportunities for studying the retrieval and interface techniques that are needed to support effective access to complex information in an Internet-based environment. Preliminary experience with THOMAS indicates that there is significant interest in this type of information, and that queries tend to be shorter than those studied in retrieval evaluations such as TREC. Techniques such as query processing, query expansion, and morphological processing all need to be incorporated and improved.

Reference-contexts: been demonstrated by recall/precision evaluations in TREC and other settings (e.g. [7]), and there are significant usability advantages for ranked output. * Passage-based retrieval The probability of relevance of a document is computed based both on the entire content of a document and the best matching passage in the document <ref> [1] </ref>. This improves the retrieval effectiveness and provides a means of viewing large documents.

Reference-contexts: For example, the query-based stemmer could decide that a 5 query word bill" should be expanded to #SYN ( bill bills), but this could be overruled by the user specifying that only the form bill" is acceptable. Research is now in progress to add such a feature to INQUERY <ref> [2] </ref>. CONCLUSION The searching and query processing customizations described above are derived from trial and error experience, rather than being based on the traditional information retrieval model of experiments based on test collections of queries and relevance judgments.

Reference-contexts: Queries can also be automatically expanded using related phrases from the corpus <ref> [4] </ref>. <p> The concept of elderly" could occur as older" or aged", while black Americans" could occur as African Ameri- cans", and be related to minorities". We are currently investigating the possibility of integrating a pre-existing thesaurus into THOMAS, or making use of an automatic association thesaurus such as INQUERY's PhraseFinder <ref> [4] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: THOMAS uses fields for some fixed attributes such as bill number and type. * Flexible and efficient indexing The indexing process is designed to be easily extensible in order to incorporate a variety of document structures (e.g. HTML, MARC, etc.), different morphological processing techniques (e.g. stemming techniques <ref> [5] </ref>), and domain-specific concept recogniz- ers (e.g. marking occurrences of people, companies, locations, and dates). <p> This came up, for example, when someone wanted to find references to Senator Byrd's dog Billy in the Congressional Record. This problem can be rectified to some extent by substituting the new stemming algorithm KSTEM developed at the University of Massachusetts for the standard Porter Stemmer supplied with INQUERY <ref> [5] </ref>. KSTEM is a more conservative, dictionary-oriented system that also permits the database designer to set up exception lists of words which are not to be stemmed. This would solve the two problems above, but requires the designer to anticipate all stemming problems which may occur.

Reference-contexts: Of course, these queries are precisely the ones which perform well without further processing. CURRENT PROBLEMS In January 1995, the Boston Globe wrote a negative article about THOMAS, claiming that the search techniques employed were faulty <ref> [6] </ref>. The writer entered the search elderly black Americans" into the system and received a bill on black bears" as most relevant, followed by bills relating to black colleges and universities". This illustrates a common problem in explaining relevance ranking to the user.

Reference-contexts: The probability value is then used to rank the documents for presentation to the user. The effectiveness of this process has been demonstrated by recall/precision evaluations in TREC and other settings (e.g. <ref> [7] </ref>), and there are significant usability advantages for ranked output. * Passage-based retrieval The probability of relevance of a document is computed based both on the entire content of a document and the best matching passage in the document [1].

Reference-contexts: including experienced searchers at academic institutions and libraries, high school teachers, lobbyists, congressional staffs, and thousands of individual citizens interested in the process of government. 1 A full evaluation of the techniques that are being deployed in THOMAS will require recall/precision comparisons based on sample query sets and relevance judgments <ref> [8] </ref>. Although we intend to carry out this evaluation, at this early stage of the development of the system, new techniques are being introduced primarily on the basis of a small number of test queries and user feedback about specific problems. <p> on current problems we describe how they could contribute. * Support for relevance feedback and routing User feedback on the relevance of retrieved documents can automatically modify either a query in a typical interactive session or a profile in a routing environment where incoming documents are compared to stored profiles <ref> [8] </ref>. These techniques are not currently used in THOMAS because it is not designed to support routing and relevance feedback can sometimes have unpredictable results when used with databases containing long documents (such as the bills). <p> This is a problem with the method used to weight terms when documents show a great variance in size and queries are short and simple. The term weighting in INQUERY is a variation of that used in other systems such as SMART <ref> [8] </ref>, and is known as tf.idf weighting. The tf (term frequency) component of this weight depends on the within-document frequency of the term, and the idf (inverse document frequency) component varies inversely with the frequency of the term in the corpus.

Reference-contexts: An examination of the searches most frequently submitted, shown in Table 1, tends to confirm this hypothesis. Although a number of studies have been done on the types of queries submitted to information services <ref> [9] </ref>, there is not a large amount of data on what happens in systems with free-form or natural language" queries. Examples of natural language searching of legal material at West Publishing [10] suggest that, in that environment, queries tend to be somewhat longer than those seen in THOMAS.
