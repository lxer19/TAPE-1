Abstract: In the syntactic theory of Tesniere (1959) the structural description of sentences are given as graphs. We discuss how the graph-theoretic concept of path-width is relevant in this approach. In particular, we point out the importance of graphs with path-width 6 in connection with natural language processing, and give a short proof of the characterization theorem of trees with path-width k.

Reference-contexts: A fourth property, not considered in 2 Andras Kornai and Zsolt Tuza this paper, is the "bladder-like" nature of the shack. In modeling the production of actual sentences, the shack hardly ever contains more than 4 items, and research on human sentence production (Yngve [Y], Church <ref> [Ch] </ref>) suggests that in a realistic model overloading the shack results in the loss of the entire memory content, rather than in the loss of the last element. This property is successfully captured in connectionist symbol manipulation models such as Touretzky and Hinton [TH].

Reference-contexts: The STMC captures the idea that the structural relations obtaining between those parts of the sentence which are already spoken and those which are not must be ke pt in the short-term memory of the speaker (see Fodor et al. <ref> [FBG] </ref>). Similarly, in order to understand the full content of the sentence, the listener has to remember (i.e. store in the short-term memory) all words having dependencies to the unspoken part.

In the present note we concentrate on one particular dependency model, put forth by Kalman and Kornai <ref> [KK] </ref>, although our observations are applicable for a wider range of dependency formalisms where the syntactic description of a sentence is given as an ordered graph (with vertices corresponding to words and arcs corresponding to dependencies).

Reference-contexts: The crucial notion in our proof (closely related in flavor to the one of <ref> [Sch] </ref>) is the concept of p-strong edges. We say that an edge e is p-strong in a tree T if both connected components of T e have narrowness p. For p 1, T (p) denotes the subgraph formed by the p-strong edges of T (hence T (1) = T ).

Reference-contexts: This property is successfully captured in connectionist symbol manipulation models such as Touretzky and Hinton <ref> [TH] </ref>. During the derivation the graph is moved from a permanent storage space which we will call the inner memory (IM) to the outer memory (OM) via the shack.
