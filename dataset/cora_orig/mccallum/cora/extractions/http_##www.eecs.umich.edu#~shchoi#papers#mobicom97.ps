Abstract: Addressed is the uplink access control problems for cellular CDMA systems that service heterogeneous traffic with various types of quality-of-service (QoS) and use Multi-Code CDMA (MC-CDMA) to support variable bit rates. Considering its distinct QoS requirements, class-I real-time traffic (e.g., voice and video) is differentiated from class-II non-real-time traffic (e.g., data). Connection-oriented transmission is achieved by assigning transmitter-oriented code channels for class-I traffic where each corresponding mobile client needs to pass an admission test. Class-II traffic is transmitted in a best-effort manner using the bandwidth left unused by class-I traffic and a transmission-rate request access scheme: whenever a mobile has class-II messages to transmit, the mobile requests code channels via a receiver-oriented transmission-request code channel, then, according to the base station scheduling, the transmission is scheduled and permitted. Addressed are the admission test for class-I connections, power control, and how to maximize the aggregate throughput for class-II traffic. The admission region of voice and video connections and the optimum target signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of class-II traffic are derived numerically. The performance of class-II traffic transmissions in terms of average delay is also evaluated and discussed based on simulations.

Reference-contexts: Voice and video fall into this class, although video requires better error performance and higher rate than voice. Currently, low-rate voice coding schemes like QCELP and VSELP are being used to deliver speech over a wireless link at a rate of 8 Kbps or less <ref> [3] </ref>. There has also been significant research on low-rate video coding techniques to transmit video at a rate lower than 64 Kbps including the new ITU-T recommendation H.263 [4]. Class-II traffic, like the conventional data service, does require virtually loss-free transmission, but does not require guaranteed rate nor bounded delay.

Reference-contexts: We, therefore, adopt a transmission-rate request access scheme, similar, in principle, to the Distributed-Queueing Request Update Multiple Access (DQRUMA) <ref> [8] </ref>, for class-II traffic, in which a mobile, upon generation of a class-II message, requests its transmission in a transmission-request mini-slot, according to a link access scheme similar to the slotted ALOHA, and the base station permits the transmission according to some scheduling principle. <p> Other researchers have also looked into CDMA to support different types of traffic. The authors of [10] considered how to support voice and data in a CDMA system using the slotted ALOHA for data transmission. A demand-assignment access control scheme was proposed in <ref> [8] </ref> to support efficient multi-rate transmissions according to the mobile's demand. The authors of [11] proposed a receiver-oriented code channel and receiver scheme for data traffic using the ALOHA access. <p> The authors of [11] proposed a receiver-oriented code channel and receiver scheme for data traffic using the ALOHA access. But, all of these have some form of shortcomings: (1) multi-rate is not supported [10, 11], or (2) class-I traffic is not supported <ref> [8] </ref>. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the specification and assumptions of the CDMA system as well as the traffic models under consideration. The communication protocols for both class I and II traffic are described in Section 3. <p> As shown in Figure 2, our scheme is based on the uplink and downlink frame formats, which are drawn basically from <ref> [8] </ref>. The uplink time-axis is divided into frames which consist of a mini-slot for ACK/NAK, a contention-based transmission-request mini-slot, a piggyback rate-request mini-slot, and a packet-transmission slot. <p> For the first attempt of a message transmission request, p r is set to 1. Upon failure of a request, however, the value of p r is decreased to p r := p r + 1 following 1; 1=2; 1=3; (i.e., the "harmonic" backoff) <ref> [8] </ref>. <p> Note that a single mobile can have all of voice, video, and data traffic at a time. First, the required convolutionally-coded symbol energies at the receiver for a voice-only (not video nor data) mobile, can be obtained by modifying the result from <ref> [8] </ref> which didn't consider any traffic classification: ^ E s = (^fl vo o + 1:5P G)=^fl vo o I est where I est is the total estimated interference level during the subsequent slot as a function of K vo , K vi , and K a dt;k , as defined
