Title: Why Cryptosystems Fail  
Author: Ross Anderson 
Address: Street, Cambridge CB2 3QG  
Affiliation: University Computer Laboratory, Pembroke  
Abstract: We present the results of a survey of the failure modes of retail banking systems, which constitute the next largest application of cryptology. It turns out that the threat model commonly used by cryp-tosystem designers was wrong: most frauds were not caused by cryptanalysis or other technical attacks, but by implementation errors and management failures. This suggests that a paradigm shift is overdue in computer security; we look at some of the alternatives, and see some signs that this shift may be getting under way.

Nonetheless, we must consider whether this is the right paradigm to adopt. Do we wish to make the computer security officer's job even more mechanical, and perhaps automate it entirely? This is the direction in which current trends may lead us, if the parallel with signalling systems is accurate.
