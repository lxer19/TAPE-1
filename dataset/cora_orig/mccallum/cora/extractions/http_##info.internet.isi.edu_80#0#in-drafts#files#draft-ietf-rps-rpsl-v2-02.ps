Abstract: RPSL allows a network operator to be able to specify routing policies at various levels in the Internet hierarchy; for example at the Autonomous System (AS) level. At the same time, policies can be specified with sufficient detail in RPSL so that low level router configurations can be generated from them. RPSL is extensible; new routing protocols and new protocol features can be introduced at any time. This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with all provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026. It can be found as draft-ietf-rps-rpsl-v2-02 in any standard internet drafts repository. Internet Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its Areas, and its Working Groups. Note that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet Drafts. Internet Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months. Internet Drafts may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is not appropriate to use Internet Drafts as reference material, or to cite them other than as a "working draft" or "work in progress."

Reference-contexts: RPSL is object oriented; that is, objects contain pieces of policy and administrative information. These objects are registered in the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) by the authorized organizations. The registration process is beyond the scope of this document. Please refer to <ref> [1, 17, 4] </ref> for more details on the IRR. In the following sections, we present the classes that are used to define various policy and administrative objects. The "mntner " class defines entities authorized to add, delete and modify a set of objects. <p> dpa operator=(integer [0, 65535]) rp-attribute: # BGP aspath attribute aspath # prepends AS numbers from last to first order prepend (as_number, ...) typedef: # a community value in RPSL is either # a 4 byte integer (ok to use 3561:70 notation) # internet, no_export, no_advertise (see RFC-1997) community_elm union integer <ref> [1, 4294967295] </ref>, enum [internet, no_export, no_advertise], typedef: # list of community values - 40, no_export, 3561:70 - community_list list of community_elm rp-attribute: # BGP community attribute community # set to a list of communities operator=(community_list) # append community values operator.=(community_list) append (community_elm, ...) # delete community values delete (community_elm, ...) #

Reference-contexts: Expires August 10, 1999 [Page 53] Internet Draft RPSL February 10, 1999 10 Extending RPSL Our experience with earlier routing policy languages and data formats (PRDB <ref> [2] </ref>, RIPE-81 [8], and RIPE-181 [7]) taught us that RPSL had to be extensible. As a result, extensibility was a primary design goal for RPSL. New routing protocols or new features to existing routing protocols can be easily handled using RPSL's dictionary class.
