Abstract: Assessing the Contribution of Representation to Results Abstract In this paper, we make a methodological point concerning the contribution of the representation of the output of a neural network model when using the model to compare to human error performance. We replicate part of Dell, Juliano & Govin-djee's work on modeling speech errors using recurrent networks (Dell et al., 1993). We find that 1) the error patterns reported by Dell et al. do not appear to remain when more networks are used; and 2) some components of the error patterns that are found can be accounted for by simply adding Gaussian noise to the output representation they used. We suggest that when modeling error behavior, the technique of adding noise to the output representation of a network should be used as a control to assess to what degree errors may be attributed to the underlying network.

Reference-contexts: The other input pattern simulated reading, by using three banks of five bits to represent the letters in the word, with a random code for each letter. In order to capture the temporal aspect of speech, the network output produces each phoneme segment sequentially, as in <ref> (Cottrell and Plunkett, 1991) </ref>. The training set we used, identical to that from Dell93 (see Acknowledgments), consists of a subset of 50 frequent English words which have both 3 letters in their written form and 3 phonemes in their spoken form.

Reference-contexts: However, once a model makes error patterns similar to humans, it is important to understand what the source of those errors is in the model. In this paper, we replicate Dell et al.'s (1993) <ref> (henceforth Dell93) </ref> model of speech errors. While our error patterns are somewhat different than the ones they found, their error patterns are exhibited by some of our networks. On average, however, the performance of these networks do not match the human data as well as they did in Dell93. <p> Performance of each network was examined at every 50 epochs; training was stopped when the networks achieved greater than 90% correct output segments. This occurred by 200 epochs for <ref> (Dell et al., 1993) </ref> and from 100 to 300 epochs for the replications presented here. For the Noise simulations, a vector consisting of each output segment in the training set was perturbed with random noise generated by a Gaussian distribution with mean 0.0 and standard deviation of 0.31. <p> For the Noise simulations, a vector consisting of each output segment in the training set was perturbed with random noise generated by a Gaussian distribution with mean 0.0 and standard deviation of 0.31. This standard deviation was selected to produce overall segment correctness percentages consistent with those produced by <ref> (Dell et al., 1993) </ref> networks, approximately (but no less than) 90% correct segments. 15 noise sequences were produced, again each with a different random seed. <p> For the overall deviation, the score is the sum of the squared differences between the human proportion and the model proportion. Each proportion is transformed by an arcsine conversion, included to correct for differences in variability for extreme proportions <ref> (Dell et al., 1993) </ref>. Deviation = X (arcsin (H p i 0:5 ) arcsin (M p i 0:5 )) where Hp i and M p i are the human and model proportion of errors on constraint type i, respectively. i ranges over the five constraint types above. <p> This being accounted for by the representation, it can then be concluded that the difference between the above rates and the performance of the correlated model <ref> (and the analogous networks from Dell93) </ref> on the Onset Ratio constraint is due to the sequential nature of the networks. Analysis:Syllabic Constituency The Syllabic Constituency Constraint (VC/CV Ratio) derives from the observance of predominantly more VC than CV type substitutions in human error data.
