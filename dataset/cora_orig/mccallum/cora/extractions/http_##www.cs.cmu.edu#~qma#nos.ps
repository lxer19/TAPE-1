Abstract: Transmission of interactive multimedia streams requires stringent Quality-of-Service (QoS) guarantees in delay, delay jitter, and bandwidth, which imposes strict resource constraints on paths being used. While the general problem of finding a path that meets multiple QoS constraints is NP complete, we have shown that such a path can be found in polynomial time if the network service disciplines are rate proportional. However, two important issues remain unsolved. One issue is how to select among all feasible paths an efficient one that achieves high network throughput. We identify four optimality criteria and for each of them we propose a polynomial algorithm that selects paths that meet the criterion. Our simulation results show that, while the widest-shortest path performs best for heavy loads, the shortest-delay path has a performance edge for light loads. Surprisingly, the path requiring to reserve the minimum bandwidth performs the worst for both heavy and light loads. We also evaluate the influence of these routing algorithms on the throughput of best effort traffic. Our results show that, using the shortest-widest path algorithm for routing guaranteed traffic can result in relatively low throughput for best-effort traffic, while the other three algorithms result in comparable performance. The other important issue is that, although these algorithms are polynomial, they have much higher computational complexity than the Bellman-Ford algorithms used in today's Internet. We propose approximation algorithms that have the running time of a constant factor of the Bellman-Ford algorithm without sacrificing network throughput. Overall, the approximation algorithms that select the shortest-delay path results in consistently high network throughput.

Reference-contexts: These applications have stringent Quality-of-Service requirements (QoS) in terms of bandwidth, delay, delay jitter, and loss rate. To provide guaranteed QoS, new network service models have been defined in both the IP and ATM community <ref> [29, 1] </ref> and new resource management mechanisms that support these service models are being developed [6, 4, 36, 23, 34, 32, 10]. QoS routing is one such mechanism with two goals: selecting feasible paths that meet QoS constraints and making efficient utilization of the network resources.

However, this result is obtained under the assumption that QoS constraints (e.g., delay, delay jitter, and bandwidth) are not related and that queueing delay is known a priori regardless of the burstiness of the traffic source and the amount of bandwidth to reserve. <p> In [5], a QoS based routing framework is defined and many challenging questions are raised.

Reference-contexts: We do not consider in this paper the more general case in which a different amount of bandwidth can be reserved on each link in this paper. In that case, QoS routing is NP-complete <ref> [19] </ref>. 3 Selecting Efficient Paths In practice, more than one feasible path is often available. This raises the question of which path to use to achieve higher network throughput (or lower blocking rate).

Reference-contexts: However, this result is obtained under the assumption that QoS constraints (e.g., delay, delay jitter, and bandwidth) are not related and that queueing delay is known a priori regardless of the burstiness of the traffic source and the amount of bandwidth to reserve. In our earlier study <ref> [21] </ref>, we observed that that QoS constraints are interrelated in a way that is determined by the network scheduling discipline and that queueing delay is determined by the amount of bandwidth to reserve and the burstiness of the traffic source. <p> The resulting routing algorithms iterate the Bellman-Ford (IBF) algorithm over different bandwidth values of all links in the network. In this paper, we move further by addressing two important issues that have not been well understood in QoS routing. First, the IBF algorithm presented in <ref> [21] </ref> finds a feasible path as long as it exists, but more than one feasible path is often available. This raises the question of which feasible path to select to achieve high network throughput. We identify four optimality criteria that can be used when selecting an efficient path. <p> In the remainder of this paper, we briefly review in Section 2 the IBF algorithm discussed in <ref> [21] </ref> that selects feasible paths for guaranteed traffic in polynomial time. In Section 3 we identify optimization criteria and present corresponding routing algorithms. Sections 5 and Section 6 examine the performance of these routing algorithms, and Section 7 present and evaluate our approximate algorithms. <p> Sections 5 and Section 6 examine the performance of these routing algorithms, and Section 7 present and evaluate our approximate algorithms. Related work is discussed in Section 8 and we summarize in Section 9. 2 Selecting Feasible Paths As discussed in <ref> [21] </ref>, by exploiting the relationship between QoS constraints introduced by the rate-proportional service disciplines, we are able to develop polynomial QoS routing algorithms that select paths subjected to delay, delay jitter, and/or buffer space constraints. In this section, we summarize the main results obtained in [21]. 2.1 Rate-proportional Service Disciplines A <p> Feasible Paths As discussed in <ref> [21] </ref>, by exploiting the relationship between QoS constraints introduced by the rate-proportional service disciplines, we are able to develop polynomial QoS routing algorithms that select paths subjected to delay, delay jitter, and/or buffer space constraints.

We refer the reader to [21] for detailed proofs and algorithms. Theorem 1 The QoS routing problem of finding a path with delay, delay-jitter, and/or buffer space constraints is solvable in polynomial time. <p> These equations relate delay, delay jitter, and buffer space to the bandwidth and the leaky bucket of the traffic source. 2.2 Iterative Bellman-Ford Algorithm The main results of <ref> [21] </ref> are summarized in the following theorem.

The IBF algorithm that is used in this paper was first described in <ref> [21] </ref>. Zhao and Tripathi in [37] proposed a similar algorithm, but is sues related to selecting efficient paths and resource utilization efficiency are not addressed. Several other studies have presented routing algorithms that are similar to or special cases of ours but in different context.

Reference-contexts: With this slight modification, the first feasible path found is a widest-shortest path. Figure 3 gives pseudocode for the widest-shortest path algorithm. 4 Simulator Design Our evaluation is based on a session-level event-driven simulator, which has been used in studying routing best-effort traffic <ref> [22] </ref> and traffic requiring bandwidth guarantees [20]. The simulator simulates the start and termination of sessions, and does route selection, admission control, and resource reservation. To increase the level of realism, the simulator does packet-level simulation of connection setup and tear-down, and of routing information distribution. <p> For this reason we also look at the performance of best-effort traffic in networks that carry both guaranteed traffic. Best-effort sessions specify how much data is to be sent, similar to <ref> [22] </ref>. The link capacity left over from guaranteed sessions is shared among all high-bandwidth sessions following the max-min fair share principle. This sharing model models ATM ABR service and under some conditions also IP networks. <p> The main difference is that the shortest-widest path does not perform as well as for the MCI topology: it often is worse than the minimum bandwidth path. Thus, the shortest-widest path is sensitive to the topology, which was also observed for best-effort traffic in <ref> [22] </ref>. 5.2 Unevenly Distributed Load In Figure 7, the traffic load is unevenly distributed: 50% of the traffic is between the West coast and East coast and the (a) b = [4KB, 8KB] and d = [80ms, 120ms] (b) b = [4KB, 8KB] and d = [200ms, 240ms] (a) b = <p> The minimum-bandwidth path algorithm performs poorly because it may select heavily loaded paths, while the shortest-widest path algorithm is sensitive to different topologies and load distribution. The result on the widest-shortest path is different from what we observed for best-effort traffic <ref> [22] </ref>, where the shortest-distance path algorithm has a clear performance edge over the other algorithms. This difference is caused by the different sharing policies of the two different traffic classes. Heavily loaded links become automatically ineligible for guaranteed sessions, causing any dynamic algorithm to route around them. <p> the max-min fair sharing policy defined in [16] and the algorithm used for best-effort sessions is the shortest distance path with the distance for a path defined as dist (P ) = k X 1 where r i is the max-min fair share rate a new best-effort session will obtain <ref> [22] </ref>. 6.1 Evenly Distributed Load Let us first look at networks with an evenly distributed traffic load. The total traffic load is split between guaranteed sessions and best-effort sessions, with 40% of the traffic for guaranteed sessions.

Jaffe and Salama studied <ref> [15, 28] </ref> heuristics to tackle the NP-problem of routing with two additive constraints. Przygienda suggested in [25] the use of cost vectors to solve the NP-complete by associating a priority to each constraint.

Reference-contexts: These applications have stringent Quality-of-Service requirements (QoS) in terms of bandwidth, delay, delay jitter, and loss rate. To provide guaranteed QoS, new network service models have been defined in both the IP and ATM community <ref> [29, 1] </ref> and new resource management mechanisms that support these service models are being developed [6, 4, 36, 23, 34, 32, 10]. QoS routing is one such mechanism with two goals: selecting feasible paths that meet QoS constraints and making efficient utilization of the network resources.

Reference-contexts: While QoS routing protocols have received much attention in both the ATM forum and the IETF QoS Routing group, QoS routing algorithms have not been well understood. Selecting a feasible path that meets multiple QoS constraints (e.g., delay and delay-jitter) is in general computa-tionally intractable <ref> [7, 33] </ref>. However, this result is obtained under the assumption that QoS constraints (e.g., delay, delay jitter, and bandwidth) are not related and that queueing delay is known a priori regardless of the burstiness of the traffic source and the amount of bandwidth to reserve. <p> In [5], a QoS based routing framework is defined and many challenging questions are raised. Several studies have investigated routing algorithmic problems associated with QoS routing. In <ref> [7, 33] </ref>, it is shown that the QoS routing problem of finding a path satisfying both delay and delay-jitter constraints is NP-complete. Jaffe and Salama studied [15, 28] heuristics to tackle the NP-problem of routing with two additive constraints.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we summarize the main results obtained in [21]. 2.1 Rate-proportional Service Disciplines A broad class of service disciplines aimed at providing per-flow performance guarantees have been proposed. Examples include Virtual Clock (VC) <ref> [35] </ref>, Weighted Fair Queueing (WFQ) [6, 23], Worst-case Weighted Fair Queueing (WF 2 Q) [2], Self Clocked Fair Queueing (SCFQ) [9], and Frame-Based Fair Queueing [31]. These service disciplines ensure that flows sharing an output link get their proportional shares of the link capacity.

Reference-contexts: Rampal [26] evaluated the performance of several path selection algorithms under the assumption of three different scheduling algorithms. The IBF algorithm that is used in this paper was first described in [21]. Zhao and Tripathi in <ref> [37] </ref> proposed a similar algorithm, but is sues related to selecting efficient paths and resource utilization efficiency are not addressed. Several other studies have presented routing algorithms that are similar to or special cases of ours but in different context.
