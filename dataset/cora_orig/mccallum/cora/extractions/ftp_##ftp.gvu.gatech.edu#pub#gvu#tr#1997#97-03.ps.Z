Abstract: Technical Report GIT-GVU-97-03 January 1997 Abstract In the future, the amount of online information will increase as more people use the Internet for a growing number of activities. Staying updated on the status of important information requires a tool that will monitor information resources and alert the user when changes occur. To remain both useful and unintrusive, such a tool must provide quick access to information in a small space. To address this need, we created Irwin, a highly configurable information monitoring tool. This paper describes Irwin and examines how four users used it over a five-month period.

Reference-contexts: They may be the only way the user knows about the change if the display is obscured or if the user is not looking at the screen. Auditory cues have proven useful in both enhancing and replacing visual cues in user interfaces <ref> [BNG89, Bre94] </ref>. Based on these previous results, we felt it would be useful to allow users to combine an auditory cue with the visual icon change. We selected sounds that are distinctive but are 2 not distracting and, most importantly, are short.

Reference-contexts: In a WIMP environment they can both provide information and invite the user to click to obtain more information. Studies have shown that changing the appearance of icons can convey additional information about their use; for example, animated icons <ref> [BSM91] </ref> convey more information about the functionality of tools in a tool palette than a static image. While Irwin does not use animated icons, it does change the color and appearance of icons based on the contents of the information resources they represent.

Reference-contexts: One method used in read wear and edit wear [HH94] is to represent the text with a line of pixels. Characteristics like length and color correspond to properties of the text such as the number of modifications. The SeeSoft <ref> [ESS92] </ref> and RunView [MA96] software visualization programs represent code with lines of pixels. The length of the line can correspond to the length of the line or function, and the color can correspond to the author, module name, or modification date.

Reference-contexts: This method performs a boolean match such that if a word or name appears in the message, the line of pixels will be highlighted with the appropriate color (see use keyword matching only. We considered using a fisheye view <ref> [Fur86] </ref> to show all of the list items at once. In a fisheye view, the size and position of the graphical representation are dependent upon 3 a coded line representing a keyword for each header indented proportional to the time at which the message was received.

Reference-contexts: To accomplish this, we need a graphical method for reducing a line or word of text into a set of pixels.

Characteristics like length and color correspond to properties of the text such as the number of modifications.
