Abstract: Decoding geometric Goppa codes can be reduced to solving the key congruence of a received word in an affine ring. If the code length is smaller than the number of rational points on the curve, then this method can correct up to 1 2 (d fl 1) s errors, where d fl is the designed minimum distance of the code and s is the Clifford defect. The affine ring with respect to a place P is the set of all rational functions which have no poles except at P , and it is somehow similar to a polynomial ring. For a special kind of geometric Goppa codes, namely C (D; mP ), the decoding algorithm is reduced to solving the key equation in the affine ring, which can be carried out by the subresultant sequence in the affine ring with complexity fl This work was presented in a talk at IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory 1991, Bu-dapest, Hungary.
