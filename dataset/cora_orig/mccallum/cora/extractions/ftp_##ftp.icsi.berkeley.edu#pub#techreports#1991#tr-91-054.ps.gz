Abstract: The access to information contained in possibly large knowledge bases is a crucial factor in the usability of such a knowledge base. In this paper, we present a method to select information relevant for a query in knowledge bases where the information is represented in a rule-based way. An approach based on artificial neural networks is used to pre-select the set of relevant rules, thus facilitating the task of the inference mechanism by restricting the search space to be traversed considerably. In addition to the information contained in the query itself, data derived from the environment in which the query is situated is used to further trim down the search space. Sources for this derivation process are data about the task under investigation as well as the history of user interactions. We refer to the first way of diminishing the search space via the query as identification; the second one is referred to as adaptation, since the selection process is adapted to the current task. The third one, taking into account the history of interactions between user and knowledge base, is called prediction, aiming at a possible prediction of the next query, or a subset of rules relevant for the next query.

Reference-contexts: If that is possible, then the question of an adequate representation and the appropriate abstraction level has to be discussed. 3.1 Approach In the following, we assume that the information of the knowledge base is represented in the form of rules and encoded through an enhanced occurrence-position scheme similar to <ref> [Holldobler, 1990] </ref>. The encoding scheme marks the occurrence of a literal at a certain position in the program and uses an additional dimension to represent alternative definitions of rules. The x axis, or knowledge axis, identifies the available information items. <p> The network described here is very simplistic and inefficient; it is derived from a similar network used for connectionist unification <ref> [Holldobler, 1990, Kohonen et al., 1991] </ref>. Its size is the number of predicate symbols times their occurrences, where each row only contains one entry. This is certainly not realistic for large knowledge bases, and a more condensed representation must be found.

Reference-contexts: This is a research proposal under preparation, in which three possible applications are discussed <ref> [Karagiannis and Schmidt, 1990] </ref>. L 0 has been chosen because the requirements which this language puts on the environment are adequate concerning the developement of the conceptual as well as the computational approaches.

Reference-contexts: Such a representation also opens the way to a treatment of semantical criteria in addition, e.g. the similarity of information in the knowledge base. For this purpose, networks like Kohonen's feature maps <ref> [Kohonen, 1990] </ref> can be used. The next step is to take into account additional information available from the context of the query, aiming at an adaptation of the relevant information to the current task.
