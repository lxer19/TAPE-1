Reference-contexts: The recent series of exciting lower bound results for approximation problems culminated in the proof that for each SNP-hard maximization problem there exists ae &lt; 1 such that every approximation algorithm has an i.p.r. at most ae, unless P=NP (see <ref> [ALMSS] </ref>, also Johnson's NP-completeness column [J]). Currently, the upper and lower bounds on the attainable approximation ratios for SNP-complete problems are rather far apart. Closing this gap, even for some of these problems, would be a significant achievement.

Reference-contexts: If this goal is ever to be reached, impossibility results would have to be improved substantially. The current ones, while technically impressive, do not even come close to intuitively "natural" values.

The matching positive result, due to Yannakakis [Y], shows how to approximate this problem with an i.p.r. of 1 1 4 .

Reference-contexts: A largest color class can be selected as the desired independent set. Alternatively we could apply the theorem that for 3 the + 1-clique is the only connected -regular graph not containing an even length cycle with at most one chord <ref> [B] </ref>. One half of the vertices of such a cycle form a good independent set to start the Greedy Algorithm. Again, such a cycle can be found with depth-first search in linear time.

Reference-contexts: Halldorsson and Radhakrishnan [HR1] have analyzed the Greedy Algorithm further and could actually determine its i.p.r. to be 3 +2 . An algorithm based on clique removals has been proposed by Paschos [P] and further investigated by Bop-pana and Halldorsson <ref> [BH] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: As a result, we pick only three nodes, while we want to assure d10=3e = 4. Except when every connected component is a + 1-clique one can still get an independent set of size n and a coloring as follows. Brooks <ref> [Br] </ref> has shown that such a graph is -colorable and the simple proof of Lovasz [L] translates into a linear time algorithm based on depth-first search to find 2-connected components. A largest color class can be selected as the desired independent set.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we are interested exclusively in approximation ratios attainable by polynomial time algorithms. Therefore, by approximating we shall mean approximating by a polynomial time algorithm. The most successful attempt to classify problems from this perspective has been the introduction of the class SNP by Papadimitriou and Yan-nakakis <ref> [PY] </ref>. Each SNP problem can be approximated with some positive constant performance ratio. In this paper, we use the inverse performance ratio (i.p.r.), which is a natural measure of the approximation quality for maximization problems.

Reference-contexts: The current ones, while technically impressive, do not even come close to intuitively "natural" values. For example, in a recent paper Bellare et al. [BGLR] show that MAX-3SAT cannot be approximated with an i.p.r. of 1 1 113 unless P=NP. The matching positive result, due to Yannakakis <ref> [Y] </ref>, shows how to approximate this problem with an i.p.r. of 1 1 4 . One may observe that a typical positive result is based on relatively simple combinatorial concepts and the progress, if achieved at all, comes in substantial increments.
