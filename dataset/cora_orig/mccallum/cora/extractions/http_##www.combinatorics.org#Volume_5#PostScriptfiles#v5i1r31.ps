Reference-contexts: A permutation w is called smooth if the Schubert cell indexed by w is smooth, and this is equivalent to w being (3412,4231)-avoiding. A generating function F (x) for smooth permutations has been obtained in <ref> [4] </ref>. In [6] a recursive formula is given for a pair equivalent to (1342,2431), from which it is easy to obtain a generating function, and see that it coincides with F (x). <p> The pair (1324,2143) This is the pair which is equivalent to the smooth permutations defined in the Introduction.

Reference-contexts: There are, however, some exceptions. One of them is that there are some inequivalent classes counted by the Schroder numbers <ref> [5] </ref> [8]. In this paper we prove that five inequivalent classes are equinumerous, namely S n (1324; 2143) = S n (1342; 2431) = S n (1342; 3241) = S n (1342; 2314) = S n (1324; 2413).
