Title: OTERS: Exploiting the Routing Topology for High-Performance Reliable Multicast

Abstract: The ever-growing Internet places increasing demand on reliable multicast. At the center of reliable multicast lies the key issue of supporting fast loss recoveries in a scalable manner (i.e., without packet implosion or excessive network traffic load). Previous works apply static configuration or TTL-and-RTT-based approaches to organize group members into hierarchical subgroups for NAK/ACK fusion and local retransmissions. However, they are unable to model the underlying multicast routing topology. Common retransmission techniques such as cascaded unicast, multi-group multicast and limited scope multicast with duplicate avoidance suffer long recovery delays and make inefficient use of the network resources. This paper presents a high-performance reliable multicast protocol (OTERS) that builds the optimal fusion tree and uses subcasting for retransmissions. This approach employs the experimental network facilities multicast traceroute and IP encapsulation. Improvements to them are proposed to address the security and privacy issues. We show that the desired functionality can be supported without injecting any additional state into the network layer, without imposing performance penalties for normal packet forwarding, and without per-hop processing delay for NAKs and repairs. Simulations of five reliable multicast protocols demonstrate that our approach substantially reduces the recovery latency and the traffic load compared to previously proposed approaches.

Reference-contexts: This paper presents such a reliable multicast protocol that employs the state-of-the-art network support such as multicast traceroute <ref> [12] </ref> and IP encapsulation [13].

In Section 9 we conclude. 2 The High-Performance Reliable Multicast Protocol In this reliable multicast protocol, a group member of a host group G discovers the multicast route from the session source S to itself using multicast traceroute <ref> [12] </ref>. An optimal fusion tree is then built via on-tree expanding ring search (Section 2.1). Retransmissions to a subgroup are subcast at the turning point of the subgroup (Section 2.2). <p> This section proposes improvements to them in the context of reliable multicast. Section 3.3 also looks into a TTL-based network support which provides the same functionality but has performance penalties. 3.1 Multicast Traceroute for Reliable Multicast Proposed in an Internet draft <ref> [12] </ref> and implemented on the MBone as mtrace, multicast traceroute defines a new IGMP packet type that allows any host H to trace the multicast route of host group G from some source S to a given destination M in a reverse manner, and have the query response returned to any

For now, we assume multicast traceroute and IP encapsulation are available network supports. <p> The traceroute extension for reliable multicast simplifies the trace information and clears most of the security and privacy concerns. Distinguished by a flag in the IGMP packet, this extension can be enforced by the normal IGMP traceroute processing. 3.2 IP Encapsulation for Reliable Multicast IP encapsulation within IP <ref> [13] </ref> is widely used in multicast routing protocols. For example, MBone uses IP loose source routing option to form multicast tunnels and glue together multicast routing domains.

This approach may be subject to longer recovery latencies and possibly NAK implosions at the source.
