Abstract: This paper describes a simulator which uses a unique hybrid particle system and dynamic constraint based model to compute the behaviour of interacting multi-body systems in a virtual environment. Simulations can be influenced by the user at run-time, so there are important interaction issues addressed. The need for such systems in virtual reality applications ranging from tissue modelling in surgical training software to use in entertainment, is apparent. Purely, a visual effect does not suffice in this context, as the behaviour of objects in the scene must be plausible enough to convince the user. Our approach provides a unified system for simulating a wide spectrum of deformable and/or rigid material behaviours in virtual environments. An example of a virtual chain, which the user can interact with, is provided.

Reference-contexts: Many such models have been successfully used in computer animation. Constraint based modelling is a technique in which forces are calculated in order to control the motion of a system. It is frequently used to animate articulated rigid body systems <ref> [2, 1, 7, 5, 9] </ref>. Other approaches concentrate purely on animating deformable materials [8, 10, 16, 17]. However, most of these approaches are too computationally intensive to be used in virtual reality (VR) applications, where a real time response is of paramount importance. <p> To keep the hinges intact we use one from our suite of dynamic constraints which is similar to Barzel and Barr's point to point constraint <ref> [1, 2] </ref>. However, our technique is more suited to VR applications where performance, and the need to change the mass of bodies at run-time is of particular importance. Barzel and Barr retain bodies in their own co-ordinate frame, transforming them into world space as required.

Reference-contexts: This enables us to build up interesting materials with any combination of rigid and deformable characteristics. be simulated using rigid building blocks and articulat ing hinges. The non-auxetic material becomes thinner when a deforming force is applied, whereas the auxetic material fills out <ref> [3] </ref>. behaviours. It is also important to note that any force function can be programmed in a script which defines the scene if a function from the library does not suffice.

Reference-contexts: Such models are confined to deformable material be-haviour only. A unified model capable of simulating both rigid and deformable behaviours is very appealing because the real world has both. Chapman and Wills' unified model uses modal analysis <ref> [4] </ref> to simplify the finite element equations of rigid and deformable motion. However, it is difficult to produce a desired behaviour using finite element based techniques because all elements are treated in the same way, and the parameters which govern their deformation behaviour are unintuit-ive.

Reference-contexts: Ideally we wish to simulate both rigid and deformable material responses, but this is complex and some VR systems which have evolved use purely rigid body models. Other systems use spring mesh primitives to build up larger bodies, such as Holton's muscle model <ref> [6] </ref>. Such models are confined to deformable material be-haviour only. A unified model capable of simulating both rigid and deformable behaviours is very appealing because the real world has both. Chapman and Wills' unified model uses modal analysis [4] to simplify the finite element equations of rigid and deformable motion.

We use a unique representation of particles as being composed of one or more points, depending on whether or not a particle is also a hinge.

Reference-contexts: Similarly, rotational torques for bodies are calculated by summing cross products of forces and particle positions as in Equation 4. This provides an angular acceleration which is also integrated. The resulting vector is converted to a matrix <ref> [13] </ref> and applied to each particle in the body.

Reference-contexts: There are five bodies shown in the scene, each comprises two particles connected by a rigid component. The particles are from different families and their relative interaction rules are shown. In three dimensions this type of behaviour can produce surface forming systems <ref> [15] </ref> but at comparatively little computational cost. 2.2 Rigid Bodies Much of the research into rigid body systems has focused on simulating the motion of purely rigid bodies, subject to forces such as gravity for animation purposes.
