Abstract: 1 This article will appear in Volume 1, no. 4 (1994) of Journal of Applied Statistical Science. Adrian E. Raftery is Professor of Statistics and Sociology, Department of Statistics, GN-22, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195. This research was supported by ONR contract no. N-00014-91-J-1074, by NIH Grant no. 5R01HD26330-02, by the Ministere de la Recherche et de l'Espace, Paris, by the Universite de Paris VI, and by INRIA, Rocquencourt, France. Raftery thanks the latter two institutions, Paul Deheuvels and Gilles Celeux for hearty hospitality during his Paris sabbatical in which this article was written. This article was prepared for presentation at the Conference on Applied Change Point Analysis, University of Maryland-Baltimore, March 17-18, 1993. Parts of this article review collaborative research with others to whom I would like to express my appreciation, namely Volkan Akman, Jeff Banfield, Nhu Le, Steven Lewis, Doug Martin, Fionn Murtagh, Ross Taplin and Simon Tavare.

Reference-contexts: Note the different time axes in the two plots: plot (a) covers 112 years while plot (b) covers only 16 years. [Sources: (a) Jarrett (1979); (b) Raftery and Akman (1986).] compare these two hypotheses (abrupt versus gradual change) quite easily even though they are not nested <ref> (Akman and Raftery, 1986a) </ref>. The result is a Bayes factor of about 4000 for the change point Poisson process against the decreasing log-linear rate model, which can be viewed as very strong evidence for the change to have been abrupt rather than gradual. from 1973 to 1986 (Smith, 1989a).

Reference-contexts: However, a fully Bayesian analysis of this model would be preferable in that it would probably be more accurate, and would yield posterior distributions of the floe outlines, rather than just point estimates. This is currently impractical, although some initial progress has been made <ref> (Bensmail et al., 1993) </ref>. In the meantime, it is possible to view the approach of Banfield and Raftery (1992) as a first, crude approximation to a fully Bayesian analysis.

Reference-contexts: The fully Bayesian approach is then much more difficult. In Section 5 I review a semi-parametric approach in which change curves are modeled by principal curves, a family of nonparametric smooth curves <ref> (Hastie and Stuetzle, 1989) </ref>. The set of potential edge elements (which may be pixels in an image or events in a spatial point process) is then modeled as a mixture of distributions each of which is centered around a 1 different principal curve. <p> A principal curve is a smooth, one-dimensional curve that passes through the middle of a higher-dimensional data set. It is nonparametric and its shape is suggested by the data: it thus provides a nonlinear summary of the data <ref> (Hastie and Stuetzle, 1989) </ref>. Starting from an initial set of possible edge pixels (or partial change curves), we developed a hierarchical clustering method for grouping these into complete change curves. The object of cluster analysis is to group a set of data points into "interesting" subsets.
