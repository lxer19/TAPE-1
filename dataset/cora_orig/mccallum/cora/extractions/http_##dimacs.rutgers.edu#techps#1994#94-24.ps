Reference-contexts: Gould [14], Wachs and White [31] studied rook placements together with Stirling numbers and their q-analogues. Garsia and Remmel [7], Sagan [28] considered the relationship between rook placements and major indices, etc.. But the geometric aspect of the rook placements was only explored until recently [4]. In <ref> [3] </ref>, we introduced a length function for rook placements on a Ferrers board and rook length polynomials. Then we gave a formula on the relationship between rook length polynomials and Garsia-Remmel polynomials. The major result in [3] is an explicit formula for rook length polynomials. <p> In <ref> [3] </ref>, we introduced a length function for rook placements on a Ferrers board and rook length polynomials. Then we gave a formula on the relationship between rook length polynomials and Garsia-Remmel polynomials. The major result in [3] is an explicit formula for rook length polynomials. As a consequence, we also obtained an explicit formula for Garsia-Remmel polynomials. In [4], we introduced the notion of a partition variety as a quotient space BnM where B is the Borel subgroup of upper triangular matrices of GL m (C). <p> We proved that BnM is a projective subvariety which has the structure of a CW-complex. The Poincare polynomials for cohomology of partition varieties with coefficients in real field R are proved to be rook length polynomials as introduced in <ref> [3] </ref> with r = m. Definition 1.1 Let m be a positive integer. <p> For example, if = (3; 1), then F = fl fl fl ! We assume, contrary to the usual convention, that F is right justified; the reason for this is explained in <ref> [3] </ref>. If r 1 let -r = i=1 where E i;j is the matrix with 1 at (i; j) and 0's elsewhere. <p> The length function l can be evaluated "locally" by the following formula which counts the contribution of each rook in , individually <ref> [3] </ref>. We often use a 1 to denote a rook and a 0 for an empty box in a Ferrers board. Proposition 2.2 (Local Formula) Let 2 R r . <p> Then, l () = i=1 Definition 2.3 Let RL r (; q) = 2 R r We call this a rook length polynomial. Theorem 2.4 (Formula of Rook Length Polynomials <ref> [3] </ref>) If is a partition with m parts then RL r (; q) = 1i 1 &lt;&lt;i r m P r r Y ( i j r + j) q (3) where (k) q = 1 + q + q 2 + + q k1 . <p> One of the main ideas in <ref> [3] </ref> is to extend a placement of r rooks on an m by n board to a placement P () of m + n r rooks on an m + n r by m + n r board.

This paper consists of seven sections. <p> In Example 2.5, since = E 14 + E 32 : we have c 1 = 1, c 2 = 3, b 1 = 4 and b 2 = 2.

Proposition 2.20 (Embedding Theorem) Let X and Y be two complex manifolds.
