Reference-contexts: When rate R is large, ffi k (R) for fixed-rate VQ can be characterized using high resolution quantization theory, which is also called asymptotic quantization theory or high rate theory. Bennett's integral for vector quantizers <ref> [1, 8, 14] </ref> gives an expression for the distortion of an arbitrary VQ, when the number of codevectors N is large, D (N ) = N 2=k m (x) where the point density (x) is the normalized density of codevectors near x, the inertial profile m (x) is approximately the normalized

Reference-contexts: A multidimensional compander utilizes a vector-valued compressor function and a lattice quantizer. In multiple dimensions, it has been shown that optimal VQs cannot be implemented using a companding structure <ref> [8, 2, 3] </ref>, except for a very restricted class of source densities. It may be that the best companders are close to optimal; however, the best multidimensional companders are not currently known. <p> For an arbitrary source, this is a difficult open problem. In this chapter, we find the asymptotically optimal compressor function for a memory-less source, under certain technical conditions on the compressor function. In order to do so, we consider Bucklew's asymptotic expression for compander distortion <ref> [2] </ref>. We then show, using variational calculus arguments, that the compressor function consisting of the optimal scalar compressor functions for each source component is the minimizing function.

Reference-contexts: At the same time, we would like to encode source vectors efficiently and 8 use an efficient algorithm for indexing. Efficient encoding and indexing algorithms have been developed for certain quantizer support regions. Given an arbitrary point x 2 &lt; k , Conway and Sloane <ref> [4] </ref> have shown that the closest point to x in fl can be found with search complexity O (k), which is significantly less that the search complexity of full-search VQ, O (2 kR ). This result shows that fixed-rate lattice quantization of bounded sources can be implemented with low complexity.

Reference-contexts: Conway and Sloane have also developed indexing algorithms of order O (k) for lattice quantizers, whose support region is the Voronoi region of a sublattice of fl <ref> [5] </ref>. However, these algorithms do not extend to other support regions, such as spherical. Efficient indexing for non-Voronoi support regions is an important open problem. The optimal scaling of a lattice quantizer has, for the most part, been determined experimentally.

Reference-contexts: This dissertation focuses on the distortion-rate performance of a particular class of vector quantizers, namely lattice-based quantization. Lattice quantization has at its core an infinite lattice fl, which is a countably infinite set of points in &lt; k that is closed under addition <ref> [6, 10] </ref>. A lattice quantizer codebook is given by R"fl, where R &lt; k , is the quantizer support. Figures 1.1 and 1.2 show examples of lattice quantizers with hexagonal support. Note that R is bounded for fixed-rate quantization but may be unbounded for variable-rate quantization.

Reference-contexts: For example, the source can be quantized in terms of its polar coordinates [17], <ref> [7] </ref>. Lattice quantization can also be used in two-stage quantization to quantize the first-stage errors [16]. In Chapter IV, we optimize uniform polar quantization, a simple lattice-based method that uses a polar transformation and a two-dimensional integer lattice.

Reference-contexts: When rate R is large, ffi k (R) for fixed-rate VQ can be characterized using high resolution quantization theory, which is also called asymptotic quantization theory or high rate theory. Bennett's integral for vector quantizers <ref> [1, 8, 14] </ref> gives an expression for the distortion of an arbitrary VQ, when the number of codevectors N is large, D (N ) = N 2=k m (x) where the point density (x) is the normalized density of codevectors near x, the inertial profile m (x) is approximately the normalized <p> The ODRFs for k-dimensional fixed-rate VQ can then be derived by choosing m (x) and (x) to minimize Bennett's integral. It is not known how to optimize m (x), but according to Gersho's widely accepted conjecture <ref> [8] </ref>, the best inertial profile m fl (x) is a constant, that is, m fl (x) = m fl k , where m fl k is the least NMI of any tesselating polytope in k dimensions. <p> A multidimensional compander utilizes a vector-valued compressor function and a lattice quantizer. In multiple dimensions, it has been shown that optimal VQs cannot be implemented using a companding structure <ref> [8, 2, 3] </ref>, except for a very restricted class of source densities. It may be that the best companders are close to optimal; however, the best multidimensional companders are not currently known.

Reference-contexts: Therefore, the complexity of such a VQ is O (2 kR ), which increases exponentially in dimension and rate. In order to achieve performance close to that of optimal VQs under reasonable complexity constraints, one must consider structured vector quantizers. There are many types of structured VQs <ref> [9] </ref>, such as product, multistage, tree-structured, trellis, lattice, and hierarchical, many of which have been shown to achieve good performance with moderate complexity.

Reference-contexts: One can think of a variable-rate VQ as consisting of a partition, a codebook, and a lossless binary code. It is known that Huffman's algorithm designs binary codes with the smallest possible average codeword lengths for a given set of probabilities <ref> [11] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Lloyd's optimality conditions can be extended to multiple dimensions, and his design algorithm was later generalized to fixed-rate vector quantizers by Linde et al. <ref> [12] </ref>. In multiple dimensions, an optimal vector quantizer satisfies two necessary conditions. First, each codevector is the centroid of its respective cell, that is, y i = E [XjX 2 S i ]. <p> Second, each quantization cell is the Voronoi region of its codevector, that is, S i = fx : kx y i k kx y j k; j 6= ig. The descent algorithms in <ref> [13, 12] </ref> iteratively design a codebook using these necessary conditions. In general, they converge to local minima, but various techniques can be used to increase the chances of finding global minima.

Reference-contexts: In general, we are interested in designing optimal VQs and in characterizing their performance. The design of optimal VQ is well understood. Necessary and sufficient 4 conditions for an optimal fixed-rate scalar (k = 1) quantizer were developed by Lloyd <ref> [13] </ref>, who developed an iterative descent algorithm for scalar quantizer design.

Reference-contexts: However, in order to achieve good performance, variable-rate VQs must use higher order entropy coders, which have high complexity. Thus, optimal VQs have high complexity; for fixed-rate VQ, the complexity lies in the quantizer, while for variable-rate VQ, the complexity lies in the entropy coder <ref> [15] </ref>. As we have seen, optimal variable-rate VQ is well understood. The best asymptotic quantizer has a uniform point density and may use an infinite number of code-vectors. There are few interesting open questions in variable-rate lattice VQ, and as a result, this dissertation considers fixed-rate lattice quantization only.

Reference-contexts: For example, the source can be quantized in terms of its polar coordinates [17], [7]. Lattice quantization can also be used in two-stage quantization to quantize the first-stage errors <ref> [16] </ref>. In Chapter IV, we optimize uniform polar quantization, a simple lattice-based method that uses a polar transformation and a two-dimensional integer lattice. Recall that for asymptotically optimal variable-rate VQ, the best point density is uniform. This suggests that lattice quantization may be optimal.
