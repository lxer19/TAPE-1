Title: Do Robots Ape?  
Author: John Demiris and Gillian Hayes 
Address: 5 Forrest Hill, Edinburgh, EH1 2QL, Scotland, UK  
Affiliation: Department of Artificial Intelligence University of Edinburgh  
Abstract: Within the context of two sets of robotic experiments we have performed, we examine some representational and algorithmic issues that need to be addressed in order to equip robots with the capacity to imitate. We suggest that some of the difficulties might be eased by placing imitation architectures within a wider social context.

Reference-contexts: There is also a close link between imitation, communication and cooperation (Klingspor, Demiris, and Kaiser, 1997): not only imitation can be used as a good way of developing communication <ref> (Billard and Hayes, 1997) </ref>, and equipping the imitator with enough knowledge about a task so it can eventually engage in cooperation with other agents, but, reversely, communication can also help in the imitation process by influencing the way that the imitator understands the task in hand, so an appropriate level of

Reference-contexts: These robot body images do not necessarily need to be designed in, and can be learned. We envisage that the two body images and their development will be closely linked (if not being instances of the same body schema), and in our work <ref> (Demiris and Hayes, 1996) </ref> we have suggested that this might be done in a distributed, topography-preserving way. * Since the robot is perceiving its own body mainly through proprioception (and frequently through vision), while it is perceiving the other agent's through the external senses, there must exist a cross-modal matching mechanism

Reference-contexts: Infants and young children, not only imitate their parents and other peers, but are frequently imitated by them (Meltzoff, 1996), often engaging in mutual imitation games.

Reference-contexts: One of them was performed on testbeds involving different types of robot heads and a human demonstrator (Demiris and Hayes, 1996; Demiris et al, 1997), where the experiments were aimed at examining the issues involved in movement imitation. The other series <ref> (Hayes and Demiris, 1994) </ref> involved two mobile robots of different morphology, where the experiments were aimed at examining the issues involved in learning through movement imitation. <p> We will focus on a couple of important issues which are relevant to our discussion here that were made evident during this work (interested readers are referred to <ref> (Hayes and Demiris, 1994) </ref> for the details). These are essentially linked with the temporal dimension of the task.

Reference-contexts: Supporting the Imitation Process Imitation is rarely a uni-directional activity, nor occurs in the absence of other learning processes. Infants and young children, not only imitate their parents and other peers, but are frequently imitated by them <ref> (Meltzoff, 1996) </ref>, often engaging in mutual imitation games.

Reference-contexts: This points out the necessity of designing a mechanism for bridging the two. In humans, such mechanisms have been hypothesised to exist at birth <ref> (Meltzoff and Moore, 1989) </ref>, although several questions regarding the specifics of such mechanisms remain unresolved.

Reference-contexts: Recently, imitation, which is seen as an important method of learning in the animal kingdom <ref> (Whiten and Ham, 1992) </ref>, has been proposed as a promising method for a compromise between the two approaches. While the robot architecture is designed in order to benefit from other agents' knowledge, this is done "from the inside", i.e. the robot learns about the world based on its own perceptions.
