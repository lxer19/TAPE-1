Abstract: Temporal reasoning with uncertainty about the ordering of events is important in a wide variety of applications. Previous research shows that the associated decision problems are hard even for very restricted cases. In this paper, we investigate using the temporal locality of events and the spatial locality of state spaces to speed inference. We propose a new perspective for representing cause-and-effect relationships based on finite state automata. This perspective exposes the sources of complexity in temporal reasoning more clearly, and facilitates transforming rule-based temporal reasoning problems into graph reachability problems. We present both positive and negative re sults that provide insight into the complexity of temporal reasoning.

Causal rules determine how events trigger state transitions. In this paper, we show that the ordering constraints on events and the size of the involved state space also play important roles. Figure 1 depicts the complexity trade-offs for temporal reachability involving these three factors.

Reference-contexts: Theorem 1 Temporal reachability regarding double events, totally unordered, in a state space of polynomial size is NP-Complete. Proof. Given a directed graph with a set of forbidden pairs of arcs, the forbidden pairs (of arcs) problem <ref> [5] </ref> determines whether there is a path between two nodes without using both arcs in any forbidden pair of arcs. It is NP-Complete even if all the forbidden pairs are disjoint. <p> The answer is yes if we can match distinct events to the directed edges in the simple directed path. 2 Nebel and Backstrom [10] prove the NP-Completeness of a special case of the temporal projection problem by a reduction from the forbidden pairs of arcs problem on directed acyclic graphs <ref> [5] </ref>. Their proof is adapted to prove the following theorem. Theorem 3 Temporal reachability regarding simple events with an arbitrary partial order on events, in a polynomial-size state space is NP-Complete. Proof. The forbidden pairs of arcs problem on directed acyclic graphs is NP-Complete [5]. <p> arcs problem on directed acyclic graphs <ref> [5] </ref>. Their proof is adapted to prove the following theorem. Theorem 3 Temporal reachability regarding simple events with an arbitrary partial order on events, in a polynomial-size state space is NP-Complete. Proof. The forbidden pairs of arcs problem on directed acyclic graphs is NP-Complete [5]. An instance of the forbidden pairs of arcs problem on a directed acyclic graph can be transformed to an instance of the temporal reachability problem where there is only a final state. The non-isolated nodes in the given directed acyclic graph are considered as states.

Reference-contexts: The Interleave constraints allow the encapsulated event subsets at the same hierarchical level to be partially ordered as a constant number of chains. We present an abstraction technique to exploit temporal locality in a hierarchical way, using a state-based approach. This technique is different from previous work on abstraction <ref> [7] </ref> in that we transform encapsulated event subsets into abstract events, instead of transforming individual operators into abstract operators. We explore spatial locality where each encapsulated event subset has local conditions that only appear in the causal rules associated with the events in the event subset.

Reference-contexts: This result motivates our effort to exploit the structure inherent in event orderings and state spaces. The use of localized reasoning to exploit locality in planning has been advocated by Lansky <ref> [8] </ref>, using an event-based approach. In Lansky's work, locality is introduced by the group constraints and the element constraints [8]. A group constraint bounds the scope of causal effects and simultaneity of a subset of events. An element constraint requires a subset of events to be totally ordered. <p> The use of localized reasoning to exploit locality in planning has been advocated by Lansky <ref> [8] </ref>, using an event-based approach.

Reference-contexts: We show that spatial locality can reduce the sizes of the state spaces involved in this hierarchical problem solving. More details regarding the temporal reasoning algorithm, the characterization of spatial locality, and the complexity analysis are presented in <ref> [9] </ref>. In Section 2, we formally define the temporal reasoning problem and contrast the two different perspectives. In Section 3, we demonstrate the complexity tradeoffs of temporal reasoning involving the ordering constraints on events, the size of the state space, and the structure of the state transitions.

Reference-contexts: In the corresponding planning problem, the planner is free to select an arbitrary set of event instances from a fixed set of event types with no restrictions on the ordering of event instances. In special cases, temporal reasoning is harder than the corresponding planning problem <ref> [10] </ref>. This happens because in these special cases the type, number, and order of events can be controlled by the planner. In most cases, if the events are not under the planner's control, however, the problems are computationally equivalent. <p> Complexity Trade-offs Previous research on the complexity of temporal projection has primarily focused on the structure of causal rules [4] <ref> [10] </ref>.
