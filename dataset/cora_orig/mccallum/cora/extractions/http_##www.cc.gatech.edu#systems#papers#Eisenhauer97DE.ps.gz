Abstract: Current communications tools and libraries for high performance computing are designed for platforms and applications that exhibit relatively stable computational and communication characteristics. In contrast, the demands of (1) mixed environments in which high performance applications interact with multiple end users, visualizations, storage engines, and I/O engines termed `distributed laboratories' in our research - and (2) high performance collaborative computing applications in general, exhibit additional complexities in terms of dynamic behaviors. This paper explores the communication requirements of distributed laboratories, and it describes the DataExchange communication infrastructure supporting high performance interactive and collaborative applications.

Reference-contexts: First, DataExchange is based on PBIO <ref> [1] </ref>, a binary I/O package which provides a variety of mechanisms for handling operation in a diverse environment. Second, DataExchange provides facilities for naming and locating data sources, for dynamically connecting to those data sources and for automatic and configurable redirection of data flow.

Reference-contexts: 1 COMMUNICATION SUBSTRATES Communication tools and libraries for high performance distributed computing have evolved substantially during the last few years, from systems enabling distributed parallel computing such as PVM [3], to industrial standards being actively implemented and improved such as MPI <ref> [2] </ref>, to recent proposals for infrastructures that can facilitate the construction of nationwide, networked supercomputers. Our work contributes to such research by addressing several specific issues that arise whenever diverse networked machines are used in research and development settings or even in production environments, by single or multiple end users.

Reference-contexts: In particular, consider a large scientific simulation running on a set of computational resources, such as a global climate model being developed for networked parallel machines <ref> [4] </ref>. This global model might interact with more detailed local climate, atmospheric or pollution models in order to enhance the accuracy of both the local and global models.

Reference-contexts: In addition, when application requirements can be stated statically, users should be able to exploit the automatic support for parallelization and for efficient inter-task communications offered by compilers, their runtime support, and specialized communication libraries. Given these assumptions, the Distributed Laboratories Project <ref> [5] </ref> at the Georgia Institute of Technology is developing communication support that addresses the interactive and dynamic nature of high performance applications, and enables their use in scientific investigations or in production environments by single and by multiple end users.

Reference-contexts: PVM supports communication with a dynamically forked remote process, but lacks the ability to initiate communication between two unrelated processes. MPI contains no support for initiating communication between unrelated processes, although MPI-2 will provide some primitive communicator location facilities. CORBA <ref> [6] </ref> recognizes the problem of dynamic location and includes a specification for the CORBA Name Service (which is getting widespread implementation). However, the CORBA name service is not useful outside of the CORBA domain.

Reference-contexts: One can, of course, program the application such that it responds to the dynamic connection of clients and automatically routes information flows to interested parties. However, such implementations tend to make inefficient use of network resources <ref> [7] </ref> and to require the application programmer to create some complex code on top of the basic one-to-one communication mechanisms.
