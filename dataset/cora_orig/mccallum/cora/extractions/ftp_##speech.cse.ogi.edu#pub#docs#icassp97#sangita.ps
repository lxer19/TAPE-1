Reference-contexts: Even one or a few corrupted elements in the feature vector lead to severe degradation of the recognition performance. Earlier work by Fletcher on articulatory index <ref> [1] </ref> (review in [2]) suggests that the human auditory mechanism decodes the linguistic message independently in different frequency sub-bands and the final decision is based on merging the information from these sub-bands.

Reference-contexts: Even one or a few corrupted elements in the feature vector lead to severe degradation of the recognition performance. Earlier work by Fletcher on articulatory index [1] (review in <ref> [2] </ref>) suggests that the human auditory mechanism decodes the linguistic message independently in different frequency sub-bands and the final decision is based on merging the information from these sub-bands. <p> We experimented with 2,4 and 7 sub-bands. In the 2 sub-band system each band had approximately 7 critical bands (frequency ranges are 0-1140 Hz, 1046-4000 Hz). The 7 sub-band system had roughly two critical bands per sub-band as suggested by Allen <ref> [2] </ref> (0 360 Hz, 330-640 Hz, 580-950 Hz, 860-1360 Hz, 1265 band system used bands in 0-765 Hz, 700-1640 Hz, 1515-2700 Hz, and 2100-4000 Hz ranges. The sub-bands overlapped to some extent due to overlapping shapes of the underlying critical bands.

Reference-contexts: Our preliminary experiments (reported in <ref> [3] </ref>) were based on a 13-word vocabulary consisting of the ten isolated digits and control words (yes,no) from the Bellcore digit database. The training set consisted of 150 speakers and 50 speakers comprised the test set. Each speaker uttered the vocabulary once. <p> EXPERIMENTS ON SPEECH CORRUPTED WITH ADDITIVE NOISE Results reported in previous sections indicate that for well-matched training and test conditions, there is no loss of performance from the multi-band approach. However, as already indicated by our earlier work <ref> [3] </ref> and as further amplified below, the multi-band paradigm offers a significant advantage when there is a mismatch between training and test conditions. 5.1. Initial experiments with sinusoidal noise In earlier reported work [3] we had experimented with various subsets of the sub-bands of the 7-band model. <p> However, as already indicated by our earlier work <ref> [3] </ref> and as further amplified below, the multi-band paradigm offers a significant advantage when there is a mismatch between training and test conditions. 5.1. Initial experiments with sinusoidal noise In earlier reported work [3] we had experimented with various subsets of the sub-bands of the 7-band model. Independent nonlinear merging networks were trained on the clean training data using all possible combinations of subsets of the 7 sub-bands. The system thus consisted of 127 different merging networks.

Reference-contexts: The training set consisted of 150 speakers and 50 speakers comprised the test set. Each speaker uttered the vocabulary once. The features used were the power spectrum values obtained after the PLP critical band filter analysis followed by cube-root compression, and equal loudness equalization <ref> [4] </ref>. Each of the sub-band classifiers was a phoneme-based HMM/MLP hybrid classifier [5]. The input to the merging process were the sub-band class conditional log-likelihoods derived for all 13 classes in each sub-band. 3.1.

Merging Techniques A critical part of the sub-band model is the merging technique of the sub-band classifier outputs.

Reference-contexts: Several techniques for integrating the decisions of the 127 trained networks were investigated, among them SNR thresholding (i.e. leaving out the sub-bands which yielded SNR estimate <ref> [6] </ref> below a certain threshold) yielded results close to that obtained by cheating when picking the best merging network. Besides SNR thresholding we have also investigated several other strategies based on the outputs from the 127 merging classifiers.

Reference-contexts: The result obtained by using the 7-band MLP is important since it supports the notion of some inherent noise robustness of the multi-band approach (already observed by Bourlard et al. <ref> [7] </ref> for the linear merging case) even when we employ the MLP merging which we previously found to be more efficient on the clean data. with white, high-frequency radio channel and car noise.
