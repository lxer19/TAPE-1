Title: Polylogarithmic-Overhead Piecemeal Graph Exploration

Abstract: We introduce a new traversal technique in the context of piecemeal exploration of unknown graphs. The problem of learning a graph via piecemeal exploration requires a robot to create a complete map of its environment, subject to two constraints. First, it cannot jump between non-adjacent vertices in one time step and second, it must return to a fixed starting point every so often. This paper presents the recursive piecemeal search (RPS) strategy together with an algorithm for the above problem. We are able to achieve O(log 2 n) overhead (where n is the number of vertices), improving on previous results of Awerbuch, Betke, Rivest, and Singh which require O(n * ) overhead. The graph is discovered via the recursive piecemeal search, which can be viewed as a combination of breadth-first and depth-first passes. The construction of RPS trees relies on the concept of sparse neighborhood covers and captures nicely the nature of the graph exploration problem. fl This paper is eligible for student travel support and for the student paper prize.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we introduce a novel search technique along with a new algorithm for the piecemeal graph exploration problem. Our recursive piecemeal search (RPS) relies on the sparse neighborhood covers of Awerbuch, Berger, Cowen, and Peleg <ref> [2] </ref>. By combining breadth-first with depth-first searches we significantly reduce the overhead associated with previous algorithms. The RPS algorithm has a running time of O (n log 2 n + m). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. <p> To control the complexity, each exploration procedure must designate at least half of its explored territory as private. Private territory cannot be touched by subsequent explorations. These innovations together with the notion of sparse neighborhood covers of Awerbuch, Berger, Cowen, and Peleg <ref> [2] </ref> allow us to eliminate the multiplicative factor associated with standard recursive BFS procedures in [3]. w v Current Strip strips as the trees rooted at v and w extend past the current strip. <p> The construction of these trees is similar in concept to the construction of the sparse neighborhood covers of Awerbuch, Berger, Cowen, and Peleg <ref> [2] </ref>. It proceeds in steps, maintaining the invariant that tree Y at any given step is identical to tree Z of the previous step. We view tree Y as the private territory, or kernel, of tree Z.

Reference-contexts: They achieve linear time on special graphs such as grid-graphs with non-convex obstacles, triangular tesselations with triangular obstacles, and planar graphs in general. Further studies in this area resulted in algorithms for general graphs, for which Awerbuch, Betke, Rivest, and Singh <ref> [3] </ref> have achieved O (n 1+* + m) running time. In this paper we introduce a novel search technique along with a new algorithm for the piecemeal graph exploration problem. Our recursive piecemeal search (RPS) relies on the sparse neighborhood covers of Awerbuch, Berger, Cowen, and Peleg [2]. <p> In the context of physical exploration, where continuity is necessary, BFS is inefficient as it has to traverse O (m 2 ) edges in the worst case (Fig. 1 b). 2.3 Recursive Exploration To deal with the above problems Awerbuch, Betke, Rivest, and Singh <ref> [3] </ref> use recursion. A BFS tree of small depth r is constructed directly with small overhead cost. For a large depth 2 4 3 n Source . . . . . . <p> Finally, we can search from different source nodes in a certain order so that new explorations do not invade into previously explored territory. This avoids multiplicative overhead, but fails to process the strip. Algorithm TREASURE SEARCH <ref> [3] </ref> applies a similar procedure a logarithmic number of times and manages to correctly process the strip, but incurs a multiplicative logarithmic overhead inside the recursion. <p> This method is doomed to (m+n 1+o (1) ) complexity. 3 RPS Exploration Strategy 3.1 The Main Idea Our algorithm follows the recursive framework outlined above. The novelty of our exploration procedure is that, in contrast to direct recursion <ref> [3] </ref>, traversal is not confined to the strip 3 and in fact may "invade" a logarithmic number of subsequent strips (Fig. 2). To control the complexity, each exploration procedure must designate at least half of its explored territory as private. Private territory cannot be touched by subsequent explorations. <p> Private territory cannot be touched by subsequent explorations. These innovations together with the notion of sparse neighborhood covers of Awerbuch, Berger, Cowen, and Peleg [2] allow us to eliminate the multiplicative factor associated with standard recursive BFS procedures in <ref> [3] </ref>. w v Current Strip strips as the trees rooted at v and w extend past the current strip. We use a local exploration routine which, given a source vertex v and a distance r, explores the r-neighborhood of v.

Reference-contexts: The measure of efficiency of the exploration algorithm is the total number of edge traversals necessary to produce a complete map of the environment. It follows that "thinking," path planning, and combining different maps are for free. 2.2 BFS and DFS Classic search algorithms, such as BFS and DFS <ref> [11] </ref>, can be viewed as natural algorithms for exploration of unknown graphs. If we allow discontinuities and if interruptibility is not a constraint, using either of them we can successfully search a graph.
