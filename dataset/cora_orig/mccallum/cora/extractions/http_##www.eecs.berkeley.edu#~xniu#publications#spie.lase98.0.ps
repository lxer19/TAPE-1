Abstract: New metrology for characterizing the chemically amplified resist is required to meet the stringent demands of DUV lithography. In this paper, we present a systematic methodology to characterize DUV photoresist by decomposing the resist thin-film into different empirical components according to their optical properties. The innovation of this metrology includes three parts: ellipsometry and reflectometry measurement data de-noising; sophisticated dispersion models derived from the Kramers-Kronig relations for optical thin-film component description; and an intelligent simulated annealing algorithm for the optimization computational engine.

Reference-contexts: Modern metrology equipment usually has more readings at the UV range, as shown in FIGURE 1. b. This makes the noise problem even worse. To address this problem, we use a wavelet shrinkage de-noising technique <ref> [1] </ref>. Wavelet shrinkage can be viewed as a nonparametric regression problem. We want to estimate an unknown signal from the noisy data . Suppose the measurement data are given by (1) where is a discrete signal and are independent and identically distributed normal errors, . <p> In parametric regression, we form a particular model for . In nonparametric regression, we make minimal assumptions about the exact nature of . Donoho proposed a nonparametric method for reconstructing an unknown function from noisy data by wavelet shrinkage <ref> [1] </ref>. This technique works in the following way: first we apply the discrete wavelet transform with level on the noisy data , obtaining wavelet detail and smooth coefficients ; secondly we shrink the detail wavelet coefficients at the 2.

Reference-contexts: Both and depend on the wavelength of light, , as well as the photon energy, , according to . A model proposed by Forouhi and Bloomer (F&B) has received considerable attention during the last ten years <ref> [3] </ref>. This model starts with a derived expression for the extinction coefficient, and the refractive index is obtained from the extinction coefficient using Kramers-Kronig integration. The F&B equations are: FIGURE 2.

Reference-contexts: A characteristic of the F-B equations is their simplicity. F&B equations have been used for amorphous and polycrystalline solid thin-films. McGahan and Woollam presented a modification to F&B formulations <ref> [4] </ref>. Jellison and Modine gave another formulation of the optical functions in the interband region [5]. However, these parameterization formulations are derived only for interband transitions. We consider them as approximate formulations for optical property description of polymer thin-films.
