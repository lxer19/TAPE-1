Abstract: The paper describes some geographical applications of a parallel GP code which is run on a Cray T3D 512 processor supercomputer to create new types of well performing mathematical models. A series of results are described which allude to the potential power of the method for which there are many practical applications in spatial data rich environments where there are no suitable existing models and no soundly based theoretical framework on which to base them.

Reference-contexts: A more complex alternative coding scheme was developed whereby the bit string was decoded to form a reverse polish expression of the model equation. This was subsequently used in a commercial version developed from AMS system called OMIGA <ref> (Barrow 1993) </ref> . Figure 2 outlines this model representation. A model consists of a number of these genes. The genes are sorted by their status (providing position independence) and then used to create a model in a reverse polish form.

Reference-contexts: does work, although there is a feeling that improved results might be obtainable if a better way of representing the problem could be found. 3 Genetic Programming based Model Breeders 3.1 Serial GP In this paper we attempt to improve on AMS by using the newer technique of genetic programming <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref>. Figure 3 outlines the basic structure of a Genetic Programming approach. GP is basically a GA that applies modified genetic operators not to bit strings but directly to the symbolic equations. <p> Figure 4 illustrates this process using crossover on a simple S expression. The genetic programming was carried out using two approaches, one a traditional method based on LISP S-expressions <ref> (Koza, 1992) </ref> and the second used a stack based representation that seemed to offer some benefits (Perkis, 1994). Both programs were written in standard FORTRAN 77 for convenience, since this allowed implementation on various high performance computer hardware.

Reference-contexts: Two of these sensors were installed in bore-holes that connected to the basal water system of the glacier, and as a result these sensors were dubbed C1 and C2 <ref> (Murray and Clarke, 1995) </ref>. Two other sensors were installed into bore-holes that did not drain on reaching the glacier bed, and were therefore assumed to reach unconnected regions of the glacier bed; these sensors were dubbed U1 and U2 respectively.
