Title: Safety Verification for Automated Platoon Maneuvers: A Case Study  
Author: Ekaterina Dolginova and Nancy Lynch

Abstract: A system consisting of two platoons of vehicles on a single track, plus controllers that operate the vehicles, plus communication channels, is modeled formally, using the hybrid input/output automaton model of Lynch, Segala, Vaandrager and Weinberg [7]. A key safety requirement of such a system is formulated, namely, that the two platoons never collide at a relative velocity greater than a given bound v allow . Conditions on the controller of the second platoon are given, designed to ensure the safety requirement regardless of the behavior of the first platoon. The fact that these conditions suffice to ensure safety is proved. It is also proved that these conditions are "optimal", in that any controller that does not satisfy them can cause the safety requirement to be violated. The model includes handling of communication delays and uncertainty. The proofs use composition, invariants, levels of abstraction, together with methods of mathematical analysis. This case study is derived from the California PATH intelligent highway project, in particular, from the treatment of the platoon join maneuver in [3].

Reference-contexts: Nearly all of this work differs from ours in using either control theory methods, or else algorithmic techniques (e.g., decision procedures based on finite-state analysis). Other formal models for hybrid systems appear in [8], <ref> [1] </ref>; these differ from ours primarily in placing less emphasis on issues of external behavior, composition and abstraction.

Reference-contexts: Our proofs cover all cases, and are sufficiently general to apply to other maneuvers besides platoon join. The proofs use discrete systems techniques, such as composition, invariants, and levels of abstraction. Additionally, the methods of mathematical analysis developed for proving invariance of state-space sets in <ref> [2] </ref> are used for reasoning about the continuous parts of the system. In addition to proving safety, we also give results showing that the given conditions on the controllers are "optimal", in the sense that any controller that does not satisfy them can cause the safety requirement to be violated.

Reference-contexts: An important maneuver for the proposed PATH system is the platoon join maneuver, in which two or more adjacent platoons combine to form a single platoon. The design of such a maneuver is described and analyzed in <ref> [3] </ref>. This maneuver involves both discrete and continuous behavior: discrete behavior appears in the form of synchronization and agreement among the controllers about the join process, plus communication among the various system components, whereas continuous behavior appears in the motion of the cars. <p> The combina-tion forms a hybrid system of considerable complexity. A key issue for the platoon join maneuver is its safety, represented by the requirement that cars never collide at too great a relative speed. In <ref> [3] </ref>, a proof of such a safety property is outlined, for the specific platoon join maneuver given in that paper. <p> Although the outline <ref> [3] </ref> gives the key ideas, from our point of view, it is incomplete as a safety verification. It does not include a complete model of all system components in particular, the discrete components are not modeled. <p> The system and its proofs should admit decomposition into separate parts, as far as possible, and should be easy to extend. In the work we have completed so far, we have made certain simplifications. Namely, we consider the case of two platoons only (as in <ref> [3] </ref>), and we consider uncertainties in only some of the parameter values. Moreover, we pretend that the controllers control the cars' acceleration rather than their jerk (derivative of the acceleration).

Reference-contexts: Again, the optimality results apply to other maneuvers besides platoon join. An alternative approach to proving safety for the platoon join maneuver, based on game theory, is presented in [5], <ref> [4] </ref>. There has been a large amount of prior work on modelling and verification of hybrid systems, as represented, for example, in the six previous workshops on hybrid systems.

In this case study, we apply the hybrid I/O automaton model and its associated proof methods to the task of describing and verifying safety for the PATH platoon join maneuver. This is a more complex example than those previously considered using hybrid I/O automata.

Reference-contexts: However, it seems that the analysis should be decomposable, for example, proving the safety requirement in a way that allows the proof to apply to other maneuvers besides just the platoon join. In previous work <ref> [7] </ref>, Lynch, Segala, Vaandrager and Weinberg have developed a formal model, the hybrid input/output automaton model , for hybrid systems, together with associated proof techniques. These techniques include methods based on automaton composition, on invariant assertions, on levels of abstraction, and on mathematical analysis for reasoning about continuous behavior. <p> result and its proof.

The model allows communication among components using both shared variables and shared actions. Several HIOA techniques make them particularly useful in modeling and reasoning about hybrid systems.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction Increasing highway congestion has spurred recent interest in the design of intelligent highway systems, in which cars operate under partial or total computer control. An important new effort in this area is the California PATH project (see, for example, <ref> [9] </ref>), which has developed a design for automating the operation of cars in several lanes of selected California highways. In this design, cars become organized into platoons consisting of a leader car and several following cars; the followers do not operate independently, but follow the control instructions of the leader.
