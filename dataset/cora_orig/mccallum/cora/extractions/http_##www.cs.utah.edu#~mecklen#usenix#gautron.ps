Abstract: Client AbstractServer invocation of servers located anywhere in a COOL distributed system. Experience has shown that for co-located client and server, optimization of the invocation path improves performance significantly. So this optimization was given particularly attention in the design of the COOL runtime system. When the client and the server are located in the same address space, the private virtual pointer of the interface object is modified to directly point to the virtual table of the skeleton class (figure 2b). 3 3 The pre-compiler generates code using multiple inheritance and hence multiple virtual pointers and tables. In our implementation, pointer updating is automatically managed by the C ++ compiler through the placement syntax of the new operator.
