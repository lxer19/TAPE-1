Reference-contexts: These graphs may be infinite and so represent a more general class of hereditarily-finite non-well-founded sets HFA 1 (possibly with infinite transitive closure). Non-well-founded sets are also called hypersets (cf. <ref> [1, 3] </ref>). Our interest to these questions arose from a work on characterizing the complexity classes of computable set-theoretic operations by some bounded set theory (BST) languages [16]- [22]. <p> Also, g is called well-founded graph, WG, if it has no infinite chains of vertices like (1). For finite graphs this means that there are no (directed) cycles, i.e. these are finite acyclic graphs, F AG, or F WG. Let us define denotational semantics [[v]] g (called also decoration <ref> [1] </ref> or collapsing in the case of WG [2, 16, 18]) for the vertices v of any graph g. <p> However, in non-well-founded case, such as in the graph gr K , there is a problem. We need sets like = fg. This leads to rather unusual non-well-founded set theory whose universe may contain sets serving as their own members, etc. <ref> [1, 3] </ref>. We confine ourselves to its subuniverse HCA of hereditarily-countable (or even hereditarily-finite) sets. <p> Also sets from the subuniverses HF HFA and HC HCA correspond to vertices of finite and, respectively, countable well-founded graphs. It can be proved in the line of <ref> [1] </ref> Theorem 1 There exists the unique, up to isomorphism, universe HCA consisting only of finite or countable sets and satisfying anti-foundation axiom (and analogously also for HFA 1 and HFA). <p> Proposition 1 (Essentially due to <ref> [1] </ref>.) The largest bisimulation relation between g and g 0 coincides with g;g 0 . Moreover, the implication ) in (3) may be replaced by equivalence , for the case of g;g 0 .
