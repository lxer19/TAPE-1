Abstract: The compact and harmonious layout of ads and text is a fundamental and costly step in the production of commercial telephone directories ("Yellow Pages"). We formulate a canonical version of Yellow-Pages pagination and layout (YPPL) as an optimization problem in which the task is to position ads and text-stream segments on sequential pages so as to minimize total page length and maximize certain layout aesthetics, subject to constraints derived from page-format requirements and positional relations between ads and text. We present a heuristic-search approach to the YPPL problem. Our algorithm has been applied to a sample of real telephone-directory data, and produces solutions that are significantly shorter and better than the published ones.

Reference-contexts: Deriving a complete pagination and layout from a candidate solution requires a decoding process. This decoding process entails the following steps (see Figure 2): 1 1 The idea of including a decoding step in the representation of candidate solutions comes from the evolutionary-computation community <ref> [3] </ref>. This particular decoding process generates page layouts in which text is placed above ads within each column. This is consistent with standard practice, e.g., that of the Pacific Bell Yellow Pages.

For instance, the optimal line-breaking problem, which bears close resemblance to the text-stream breaking problem, is solvable in linear time by a dynamic programming algorithm <ref> [9] </ref>. However, since text-stream breaking relies on the configuration of ads, and ad placement relies on the positioning of text (in particular, on the placement of the section headers), the two must be solved together; any dynamic-programming solution must handle ads as well as text.

Reference-contexts: Figure 3 contains a pseudocode description of our particular variant of simulated annealing. It should be noted that it is our expectation that the particular stochastic search method is far less important than the search space representation used. (See, for instance, the discussion by <ref> [15] </ref>.) The search starts with the initial candidate solution described in Table 3. To generate neighboring solutions we use the perturbation operators described in Table 4. In addition to the shift operator, we tried combinations of several other operators for modifying the ad-stream page breaks.

Reference-contexts: Since the ad and text streams are fixed, compactness is achieved by reducing the amount of filler. A typical YP directory in the United States contains approximately 10% wasted space. With 350,000,000 commercial directories printed annually in the United States alone <ref> [18] </ref>, the wastage is considerable. Thus the achievement of more compact layouts without sacrificing layout quality could be very useful. Of course, improving layout quality at the same time would be even better.
