Title: Modular Redundant Manipulator Design for Dynamic Performance

Abstract: This article presents a methodology for the modular design of redundant manipulators for improved dynamic performance. The modularity is obtained from a special decomposition of the design problem into smaller more manageable subproblems. This decomposition corresponds to a division of the redundant mechanism into non-redundant macro and mini substructures that will be designed separately. The design of these substructures is based on recently developed characterizations of end-effector inertial and acceleration properties. These characterization treat the properties related to linear and angular motion separately in order to address the in-homogeneities, or differences in units, between them. The result of this analysis is a highly efficient design process. An important aspect of this analysis are the bounds it provides on the characteristics of the overall mechanism. The methodology is illustrated on the design of a six degree-of-freedom planar manipulator.

Reference-contexts: A macro manipulator designed with less performance is considered underdesigned and will reduce the null space performance of the overall mechanism. The development of these upper bounds is the main improvement over the early work done on this methodology <ref> [7] </ref>. 7 However, also note that equation (22) defines a dependency base accelerations and the reaction forces required to produce those motions. Thus the macro end-effector, when attached to the mini base, will experience both an applied force and an acceleration.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In this paper, we present a modular approach to addressing the design problem for redundant robotic manipulators. This work has its foundations in our previous studies of macro/mini manipulator systems <ref> [16] </ref>. The main result from those studies employed here is that a redundant manipulator can be divided into two or more substructures whose interactions can be analyzed in order to obtain insights into the overall mechanism's behavior.
