Title: Knowledge Acquisition with a Knowledge-Intensive Machine Learning System

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the integration of knowledge acquisition and machine learning techniques. We argue that existing machine learning techniques can be made more useful as knowledge acquisition tools by allowing the expert to have greater control over and interaction with the learning process. We describe a number of extensions to FOCL (a multistrategy Horn-clause learning program) that have greatly enhanced its power as a knowledge acquisition tool, paying particular attention to the utility of maintaining a connection between a rule and the set of examples explained by the rule. The objective of this research is to make the modification of a domain theory analogous to the use of a spread sheet. A prototype knowledge acquisition tool, FOCL-1-2-3, has been constructed in order to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.

Reference-contexts: FOCL-1-2-3 does not address the problem of knowledge integration. Since the system does not handle structured objects, knowledge integration usually devolves to relation modification. However, sophisticated knowledge integration techniques like those found in KI <ref> (Bareiss, Porter & Murray, 1989) </ref> can be incorporated as we begin to deal with more complex representation languages and structured objects. Currently, we have only tested FOCL-1-2-3 on a small number of knowledge bases: the student loan domain, a trade negotiations domain, and a track identification domain.

Reference-contexts: The purpose of a learning algorithm is to generalize, distill or abstract the input information into a more useful form. From the perspective of knowledge acquisition, machine learning programs such as ID3 (Quinlan, 1986), EITHER (Ourston & Mooney, 1990)), KBANN (Shavlik & Towell, 1989), FOIL (Quinlan, 1990), GOLEM <ref> (Muggleton & Feng, 1990) </ref>, FOCL (Pazzani & Kibler, 1992; Pazzani, Brunk & Silverstein, 1991), FORTE (Richards & Mooney, 1991), and AUDREY (Wogulis, 1991) are just black box abstraction machines.

Reference-contexts: The interactive learning system, CLINT (DeRaedt & Bruynooghe, 1989;1992), is an example of an algorithm that begins to open the learning process. Learning in CLINT is guided by the user's answers to system generated queries. The MOBAL <ref> (Morik, 1991) </ref> environment extends the level of cooperation between the user and the learning algorithm even further offering a balanced cooperative approach in which the user is free to enter any information that the system might use.

KR, the knowledge revision component, was designed to use three heuristics and a derivation of the learned descriptions generated by FOCL to suggest revisions to the knowledge base.

Reference-contexts: In this section, we give a brief overview of FOCL for those unfamiliar with the system. For a detailed description of the FOCL algorithm and a complexity analysis see <ref> (Pazzani & Kibler, 1992) </ref>. FOCL uses a separate-and-conquer approach guided by an information-based heuristic to produce a set of clauses such that all the positive examples are covered by at least one clause and no negative example is covered by any clause.

Given a collection of examples (and possibly some background knowledge) each algorithm outputs a description of these examples in an alternate representation a decision tree, a set of rules, or a network of weights.
