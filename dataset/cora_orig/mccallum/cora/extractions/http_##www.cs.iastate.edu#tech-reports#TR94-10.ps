Reference-contexts: Surprisingly, this says there exist languages H such that P m (H) is "not small" inside of E 2 but is "small" inside of E ! 12 5 Conclusion Very recently and independently of this work, Ambos-Spies, Terwijn, and Zheng <ref> [1] </ref> proved a result that is slightly stronger than Theorem 4.1. Using facts about resource-bounded randomness, they prove that almost every problem in E is weakly P m -complete for E. Thus Theorem 4.1 of this paper can be improved to a "measure 1" result.

Reference-contexts: The other classes that we mention here (e.g., P and NP) have standard definitions. (See <ref> [2] </ref>.) If A and B are decision problems, then a polynomial time, many-one reduction (briefly P m - reduction) of A to B is a function f 2 p such that A = f 1 (B) = fx j f (x) 2 Bg.

Reference-contexts: There is some, albeit tenuous, evidence in support of Lutz's general conjecture. For example, a recent result of Kautz and Miltersen [6], when taken in combination with a classical result of Bennett and Gill <ref> [3] </ref>, shows that, relative to a random oracle, every NP-complete problem is weakly complete, but not complete, for E. Moreover, there is some evidence in support of Lutz's specific conjecture that the satisfiability problem is weakly complete, but not complete, for E.

Reference-contexts: Here we use this fact to show that one well-known property of completeness for E is not retained by the notion of weak completeness. It is well-known that every complete problem for E is easily decidable on certain instances. For example, Berman <ref> [4] </ref> shows that every complete problem for E has an infinite polynomial-time decidable subset. <p> The first of these says that there exist weakly P m -complete languages for E that are P-bi-immune. (A language B is P-immune if B has no infinite polynomial-time decidable subset. B is P-bi-immune if both B and B c are P-immune.) Previously, Berman <ref> [4] </ref> established that no P m -complete language for E is P-immune. Corollary 4.3 (Lutz [10]). There exists a language H that is P-bi-immune and weakly P m - complete for E. Proof.

Reference-contexts: For example, a number of very plausible consequences follow from Lutz's conjecture that are not known to follow from the weaker hypothesis that P 6= NP. (See <ref> [5, 9, 12, 13, etc.] </ref>, for example.) The main result of this paper shows that Lutz's general conjecture is at least partially correct; many more problems are weakly complete for E than are complete for E. <p> A decision problem A is said to be weakly complete <ref> [5, 7, 10, etc.] </ref> for E if A 2 E and the set of all problems reducible to A, P m (A) = fB j B P m Ag, does not have measure 0 in E. (The last part of this definition refers to resource-bounded measure, a generalization of Lebesgue measure <p> The first of these properties is that weak completeness implies strong intractability. For example, every weakly complete problem for E requires exponential time to decide on an exponentially dense set of inputs (Juedes and Lutz <ref> [5] </ref>). The second of these properties is that weak completeness is preserved by polynomial-time many-one reductions. That is, if A is weakly complete for E and A P m B 2 E, then B must be weakly complete for E. <p> The distribution of completeness in E was known previous to this work. Work of Mayordomo [16] and Juedes and Lutz <ref> [5] </ref> established that the set of weakly complete problems for E has measure 0 in E. Their work, in combination with the main theorem, implies that the set of weakly complete problems that are not complete for E does not have measure 0 in E. <p> It follows that (P m (H)jE) 6= 0 and thus that H is weakly P m -hard for E. Condition (3) guarantees that H is not P m -hard for E. (By Theorem 6.1 of <ref> [5] </ref>, no P m -hard problem for E is incompressible by such reductions.) To complete the proof of Theorem 1.1, the language H is padded to produce a C 2 E with the desired properties. <p> This completes the proof. 2 We conclude this section with the details of the above-sketched proof of Theorem 1.1. Alternate Proof of Theorem 1.1. By Theorem 4.3 of <ref> [5] </ref>, there exists a p-computable martin gale d f such that d f succeeds on the set Y = fA j A is not incompressible by DTIME (2 4n ) m -reductionsg: Fix one such d f and let ^ d f be a p-computation of d f . <p> Since S 1 [d f ] S 1 [d s + d f ], H 62 S 1 [d f ] and so H must be incompressible by DTIME (2 4n ) m -reductions. From Theorem 6.1 of <ref> [5] </ref>, it follows that H is not P m -complete for E. 9 We construct the H via a straightforward martingale diagonalization. Let y n = H [0::n 1]. <p> Again, we prove the corollary for C = E. The proof for C = E 2 is analogous. By Theorem 5.3 of <ref> [5] </ref>, the set H E = fA j A is P m -complete for Eg has measure 0 in E. <p> Proof. The set P B = fA j A is P-bi-immune g 11 has measure 1 in E by a result of Mayordomo [16]. Since W E does not have measure 0 in E, this implies that P B " W E " E 6= ;. 2 In <ref> [5] </ref>, it is shown that every DTIME (2 4n ) complexity core of every P m -hard language for E has a dense complement. <p> Proof. The set BC = fA f0; 1g fl j A has f0; 1g fl as a DTIME (2 4n )-complexity core g has measure 1 in E by Corollary 4.6 of <ref> [5] </ref>. Since W E does not have measure 0 in E, this implies that BC " W E " E 6= ;. 2 We conclude this section by examining the distribution of weakly P m -hard problems for E inside of E 2 . <p> Proof. Let H be weakly P m -hard for E and let I = fA f0; 1g fl j A is incompressible by P m -reductionsg: Notice that the set I has measure 1 in E by Theorem 4.3 of <ref> [5] </ref>, and the set P m (H) has does not have measure 0 in E by the definition. It follows that I " P m (H) " E 6= ;. Fix A in I "P m (H)"E. Lemma 5.2 of [5] says that if A is in I "E, then P <p> I has measure 1 in E by Theorem 4.3 of <ref> [5] </ref>, and the set P m (H) has does not have measure 0 in E by the definition. It follows that I " P m (H) " E 6= ;. Fix A in I "P m (H)"E. Lemma 5.2 of [5] says that if A is in I "E, then P 1 m (A) = fB j A P has p-measure 0.

Intuitively, this says that P m (A) " E is not a small subset of E.) This notion generalizes the classical notion of completeness for E, while at the same time retaining two desirable properties of completeness. <p> We say that A is polynomial time, many-one reducible (briefly, P m reducible) to B, and we write A P m B, if there exists a P m -reduction f of A to B. We conclude this section with a brief review of resource-bounded measure <ref> [8, 10, 11] </ref>. Resource bounded measure is formulated here in terms of of computable betting strategies called martingales. <p> A p-computation of d is a computation ^ d of d such that ^ d 2 p. (According to convention <ref> [8, 10, 11] </ref>, ^ d is a p-computation of d if ^ d (r; w) is computable in (r + jwj) O (1) time.) Similarly, a p 2 -computation of d is a computation ^ d of d such that ^ d 2 p 2 . <p> A martingale d is p-computable (p 2 -computable) if it has a p-computation (p 2 - computation). The following definitions characterize "small" and "large" sets in terms of p and p 2 computable martingales. Definition (Lutz <ref> [8, 11] </ref>). Let X be a set of decision problems. (1) X has p-measure 0 if there is a p-computable martingale d such that X S 1 [d]. <p> If X has either p-measure 0 or p 2 -measure 0, then X is a negligibly small set of languages. The following definitions provide a means to characterize "small" and "large" sets of decidable languages. Definition (Lutz <ref> [8, 11] </ref>). Let X be a set of decision problems. (1) X has measure 0 in E, and we write (X j E) = 0, if X " E has p-measure 0. <p> The above definitions provide the basis for resource-bounded measure in E and E 2 . One related definition is necessary for our examination of the distribution of weak completeness in section 4. Definition (Lutz <ref> [8] </ref>). A language A is p-random if no p-computable martingale d succeeds on A. <p> The proof for C = E 2 is analogous. By Theorem 5.3 of [5], the set H E = fA j A is P m -complete for Eg has measure 0 in E. Since the collection of sets of measure 0 in E is closed under union <ref> [8] </ref>, it follows from Theorem 4.1 that W 0 E does not have measure 0 in E. 2 The remaining immediate corollaries of Theorem 4.1 show that previously established upper bounds on the complexity of complete problems do not apply to all weakly complete problems. <p> Since H 2 P 1 m (A), it follows that H is not p-random. 2 Since the set of p-random languages has measure 1 in E 2 <ref> [8] </ref>, it follows that weakly P m -hard languages for E are rare in E 2 . Corollary 4.6.

(The last part of this definition refers to resource-bounded measure, a generalization of Lebesgue measure <p> Weak completeness is a proper generalization of completeness in E. This fact is not immediate from the definition. In fact, the existence of weakly complete problems that are not complete for E remained an open question for some time. Recently, Lutz <ref> [10] </ref> resolved this question by proving the following theorem. Theorem 1.1 (Lutz [10]). There exist problems that are weakly P m -complete, but not P m - complete, for E.

Thus our main theorem implies that, unlike the complete problems for E, there exist weakly complete problems for E that are P-immune. (This result also follows easily from Lutz's <ref> [10] </ref> original work.) This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains preliminary notation and a brief review of resource-bounded measure. We use section 3 to explain, simplify, and refine Lutz's martingale 2 diagonalization technique. There we use our refined martingale diagonalization technique to give an alternate proof Theorem 1.1. <p> We say that A is polynomial time, many-one reducible (briefly, P m reducible) to B, and we write A P m B, if there exists a P m -reduction f of A to B.

Similarly, a p 2 -computation of d is a computation ^ d of d such that ^ d 2 p 2 . <p> The proof of Theorem 1.1 uses an involved argument to show that the conditions (1)-(3) can be satisfied simultaneously. This argument hinges on the fact that the set of all p-computable martingales can be efficiently enumerated. In <ref> [10] </ref>, such an enumeration is referred to as a rigid enumeration. Theorem 3.1 (Martingale Enumeration Theorem [10]). <p> This argument hinges on the fact that the set of all p-computable martingales can be efficiently enumerated.

Theorem 3.1 (Martingale Enumeration Theorem [10]). <p> Thus H d is weakly P m -complete, but not P m -complete for E by the argument in <ref> [10] </ref>. In our simplified proof it is crucial that the basic martingale diagonalization produce a language H d 2 E. To ensure this, we must be able to compute the strong martingale d s efficiently. The following technical lemma guarantees that such efficient strong martingales exist. <p> B is P-bi-immune if both B and B c are P-immune.) Previously, Berman [4] established that no P m -complete language for E is P-immune. Corollary 4.3 (Lutz <ref> [10] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: The distribution of completeness in E was known previous to this work. Work of Mayordomo <ref> [16] </ref> and Juedes and Lutz [5] established that the set of weakly complete problems for E has measure 0 in E. Their work, in combination with the main theorem, implies that the set of weakly complete problems that are not complete for E does not have measure 0 in E. <p> It is well-known that every complete problem for E is easily decidable on certain instances. For example, Berman [4] shows that every complete problem for E has an infinite polynomial-time decidable subset. In contrast to Berman's result, Mayordomo <ref> [16] </ref> proves that the set of P-immune problems has measure 1 in E. (A problem B is P-immune if it has no infinite polynomial-time decidable subset.) Thus our main theorem implies that, unlike the complete problems for E, there exist weakly complete problems for E that are P-immune. (This result also <p> Corollary 4.3 (Lutz [10]). There exists a language H that is P-bi-immune and weakly P m - complete for E. Proof. The set P B = fA j A is P-bi-immune g 11 has measure 1 in E by a result of Mayordomo <ref> [16] </ref>. Since W E does not have measure 0 in E, this implies that P B " W E " E 6= ;. 2 In [5], it is shown that every DTIME (2 4n ) complexity core of every P m -hard language for E has a dense complement.
