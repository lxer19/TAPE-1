Abstract: This paper appeared in 1995 in The Proceedings of the Seventeenth Annual Cognitive Science Conference, 562-567. Pittsburgh: Lawrence Earlbaum Associates. Abstract As they gain expertise in problem solving, people increasingly rely on patterns and spatially-oriented reasoning. This paper describes the integration of an associative visual pattern classifier and the automated acquisition of new, spatially-oriented reasoning agents that simulate such behavior. They are incorporated into a game-learning program whose architecture robustly combines agents with conflicting perspectives. When tested on three games, the visual pattern classifier learns meaningful patterns, and the pattern-based, spatially-oriented agents generalized from these patterns are generally correct. The trustworthiness and relevance of these agents are confirmed with an algorithm that measures the accuracy of the contribution of each agent to the decision-mak-ing process . Much of the knowledge encapsulated by the correct new agents was previously inexpressible in the programs representation and in some cases is not readily deducible from the rules. In this paper we describe the use of an associative visual memory and spatially-oriented reasoning agents in two-per son, perfect information, finite-board games. This approach uses two kinds of pattern-oriented learning for game play ing: the association of particular patterns with successful or unsuccessful play, and the construction of spatially-oriented heuristics from those patterns. Figure 1(a), where the empty locations are blanks and # denotes dont care, is an exam -ple of the first kind of pattern learning; it links a particular pattern from tic-tac-toe with success for X. In any symmet -ric orientation and whatever the # squares contain, a human expert associates such a configuration with a win for X. Along with particular patterns, game-playing experts use more general but equally salient heuristics as spatially-ori ented rules of thumb. Figure 1(b) is an example of the second kind of pattern learning. It is the spatially-oriented heuristic reflect Os move through the center, proved to be optimal play for X in the game of lose tic-tac-toe (Cohen, 1972). Advice from experts on how to analyze and play games is repeatedly couched in the language of such spa tially-oriented patterns. Chess and checkers are discussed in terms of controlling the center of the board, while control of the edges is crucial in Othello (Fine, 1989; Gelfer, 1991; Lee & Mahajan, 1990; Samuel, 1963). Concepts such as shape and thickness are fundamental to the game of Go (Hideo, 1992; Iwamoto, 1976; Yoshio, 1991) . As people improve their expertise in game playing, they increasingly employ spatially-oriented heuristics, and treat them as com To learn pattern associations, programs use a feature lan -guage and inductive learning algorithms that operate on game states described in that language. De Groot proposed a recognition-association model to explain human chess skill in terms of spatial patterns (de Groot, 1965) . Chase and Simon refined this model to include recall from long term memory in terms of spatial chunks (Chase & Simon, 1973; Simon & Gilmartin, 1973). There are several chess playing programs that capitalize upon patterns (George & Schaeffer, 1991; Levinson & Snyder, 1991) . Applying learned patterns to game playing, however, has proved somewhat problem atic. There are usually a great many of them and matching is nontrivial. T2 and Zenith, for example, learned predicate calculus expressions for tic-tac-toe and Othello, respectively (Fawcett & Utgoff, 1991; Yee, Saxena, Utgoff, & Barto, 1990). On one run T2 learned 45 tic-tac-toe concepts with 52 exception clauses after 800 contests, a great many for so simple a game. piled knowledge, integrated but no longer reasoned about.
