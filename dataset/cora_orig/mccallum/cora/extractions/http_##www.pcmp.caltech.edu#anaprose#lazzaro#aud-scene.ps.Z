Title: Silicon Models for Auditory Scene Analysis  
Author: John Lazzaro and John Wawrzynek

Abstract: We are developing special-purpose, low-power analog-to-digital converters for speech and music applications, that feature analog circuit models of biological audition to process the audio signal before conversion. This paper describes our most recent converter design, and a working system that uses several copies of the chip to compute multiple representations of sound from an analog input. This multi-representation system demonstrates the plausibility of inexpensively implementing an auditory scene analysis approach to sound processing.

Reference-contexts: Recent research in auditory scene analysis involves using computational models of these auditory brainstem representations in engineering applications. Computation is a major limitation in auditory scene analysis research: the complete auditory processing system described in <ref> (Brown and Cooke, 1994) </ref> requires two hours of computation on a fast workstation to process a second of sound.

Reference-contexts: The time of transaction initiation carries essential information. This coding method is also known as the address-event representation. * Many converters can be used in the same system, sharing the same asynchronous output bus <ref> (Lazzaro and Wawrzynek, 1995) </ref>. No extra components are needed to implement bus sharing; the converter bus design includes extra signals and logic that implements multi-chip bus arbitration.

Reference-contexts: CONVERTER DESIGN 35,000 transistor chip was fabricated in the 2m, n-well process of Orbit Semiconductor, brokered through MOSIS; the circuit is fully functional. Below is a summary of the general architectural features of this chip; unless otherwise referenced, circuit details are similar to the converter design described in <ref> (Lazzaro et al., 1994) </ref>. * An analog audio signal serves as input to the chip; dynamic range is 40dB to 60dB (1-10mV to 1V peak, dependent on measurement criteria). * This signal is processed by analog circuits that model cochlear processing (Lyon and Mead, 1988) and sensory transduction; the audio signal <p> No extra components are needed to implement bus sharing; the converter bus design includes extra signals and logic that implements multi-chip bus arbitration. This feature is a major difference between this design and <ref> (Lazzaro et al., 1994) </ref>. * The converter includes a digitally-controllable parameter storage and generation system; 25 tunable parameters control the behavior of the analog processing blocks.

Reference-contexts: In these applications, the input takes an analog form: a voltage signal from a microphone or a guitar pickup. Low-power analog circuits that compute auditory representations have been implemented and characterized by several research groups these working research prototypes include several generation of cochlear models <ref> (Lyon and Mead, 1988) </ref>, periodicity models, and binaural models. These circuits could be used to compute auditory representations directly on the analog signal, in real-time, using these low-power, area-efficient analog circuits. <p> details are similar to the converter design described in (Lazzaro et al., 1994). * An analog audio signal serves as input to the chip; dynamic range is 40dB to 60dB (1-10mV to 1V peak, dependent on measurement criteria). * This signal is processed by analog circuits that model cochlear processing <ref> (Lyon and Mead, 1988) </ref> and sensory transduction; the audio signal is transformed into 119 wavelet-filtered, half-wave rectified, non-linearly compressed audio signals.
