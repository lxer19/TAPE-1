Abstract: Communication networks shared by selfish users are considered and modeled as noncooperative repeated games. Each user is interested only in optimizing its own performance by controlling the routing of its load. We investigate the existence of a Nash equilibrium point (NEP) that achieves the system-wide optimum cost. The existence of a subgame-perfect NEP that not only achieves the system-wide optimum cost but also yields a cost for each user no greater than its stage game NEP cost is shown for two-node multiple link networks. It is shown that more general networks where all users have the same source-destination pair have a subgame-perfect NEP that achieves the minimum total system cost, under a mild technical condition. It is shown general networks with users having multiple source-destination pairs don't necessarily have such an NEP.

Reference-contexts: In fact, it is an SPNEP. One thing to notice about ~ f is that the costs of some users may be greater than their cost at the stage game NEP. Friedman in <ref> [4] </ref> shows that any cost vector that strictly Pareto-dominates a stage game NEP cost vector in each coordinate can be supported by an SPNEP for discount factors sufficiently close to 1.

For more details, refer to <ref> [6] </ref>, [7], and [17]. One can model a game in many different ways, depending on the properties and information available to the users. In static games, the interaction between users occurs only once, while in dynamic games the interaction occurs several times. <p> We will now state two key theorems in game theory for repeated games, that will be used to prove the results of this paper. For more details on the theorems and their proofs, refer to <ref> [6] </ref>, [7] 4 , and [17]. These theorems are about repeated games with discounting. Namely, the same static game, called the stage game, is played an infinite number of times. <p> In case (1), the existence of an NEP that achieves the minimum total system cost follows directly from the folk theorem, which was described in section 2, see <ref> [6] </ref>. Consider the following strategy profile in the repeated game. Initially each user i uses the flow configuration ~ f i = r i R f 0 until exactly one user deviates at some period k. <p> The details are part of the proof of the folk theorem, see <ref> [6] </ref>, pp. 158 -160.

Reference-contexts: In an attempt to understand the dynamics of modern networks, we address the routing problem from a game theoretic point of view, but using the concepts and techniques of dynamic game theory. Our starting point is a paper of Orda, Rom, and Shimkin <ref> [16] </ref>, where a routing problem, formulated precisely in section 3, is considered using a static game theoretic model. The agents in this routing game are naturally thought of as being the network access providers. <p> In particular, we are interested in how efficient such Nash equilibria are relative to the system wide optimum cost that might be achievable if the network could force all the users to operate cooperatively to minimize the overall cost. In the static game model considered in <ref> [16] </ref>, the uniqueness of the NEP in the routing problem for a two node network with parallel links is proved, for a wide class of cost functions. <p> In more general networks, the situation is even more complicated, because uniqueness of NEP does not hold even for rather natural cost functions. An example is given in <ref> [16] </ref> where there is more than one NEP when the cost functions are of what they call type-A. In this paper we restrict ourselves to cost functions that are of type-C in the terminology of [16]. <p> An example is given in <ref> [16] </ref> where there is more than one NEP when the cost functions are of what they call type-A. In this paper we restrict ourselves to cost functions that are of type-C in the terminology of [16]. Such cost functions are motivated by the delay formula in an exponential server queue, see section 3 for more details. <p> However, we show by means of an example that the systemwide minimum cost could sometimes be strictly smaller than this minimum, so the preceding result, while encouraging, is not strong enough. We should mention that, since the appearance of <ref> [16] </ref>, a number of other works have also appeared that discuss extensions of this model. <p> The cost of user i generally depends not only on its flow configuration but also on those of other users. Since we are assuming that every user is selfish, the problem can be modeled as a noncooperative game where each user is trying to minimize its cost <ref> [16] </ref>. A natural question that arises in this type of setting is whether there is a Nash equilibrium of the game or not. <p> However, one problem with an NEP is that it is not necessarily very efficient. In fact, Korillis, Lazar, and Orda <ref> [16] </ref> give numerical examples with natural cost functions where the difference between the total cost at the system-wide optimum point and that at the NEP could be more than 20 percent. In our analysis, we use what are called type-C cost functions in [16]. <p> In fact, Korillis, Lazar, and Orda <ref> [16] </ref> give numerical examples with natural cost functions where the difference between the total cost at the system-wide optimum point and that at the NEP could be more than 20 percent. In our analysis, we use what are called type-C cost functions in [16]. <p> We will call i user i's marginal cost at the NEP. Orda, Rom, and Shimkin prove in <ref> [16] </ref> that in the parallel link case with type-C cost functions there is a unique NEP. An important consequence of this is that given a set of demands for all the users, there is a unique system flow configuration, f 0 , that achieves the smallest total system 6 cost. <p> For more details, refer to <ref> [16] </ref>. Assume that users are ordered by decreasing demand and links are ordered by decreasing capacity. <p> See the paper of Orda et al. <ref> [16] </ref> for more details, if necessary. Uniqueness of the NEP has been proven for only a few special cases. <p> Since all user i does at the NEP is take away some capacity from each link it uses, we may reduce C l by f i l (n) for each l 2 L and consider the resulting network with n identical users. From Theorem 5 of <ref> [16] </ref> each of the identical users in this network uses the same set of paths. Let P (n) be the set of paths used by user i at the NEP and P 0 (n) the set of paths used by each of the other n identical users.

Reference-contexts: This implies that player 2 playing L at node m is not a credible threat and that player 1 should always play R at the beginning of the game. We will now discuss a result due to Rosen <ref> [18] </ref>, which is used to establish the existence of a Nash equilibrium of the stage games that will be discussed in the following sections. <p> We assume that for all f 2 F , J i (f ) is continuous in f and is convex in f i for each fixed (f 1 ; :::; f i1 ; f i+1 ; :::; f I ). Then Theorem 1 in <ref> [18] </ref> states that there always exists a Nash equilibrium point for such a game. Let us now define player i's reservation cost, a concept which is used later in stating the folk theorem for repeated games. <p> Otherwise, at least one user with infinite cost can change its own flow configuration to have finite cost. It turns out that, under these assumptions, the routing game satisfies the conditions of the theorem of Rosen <ref> [18] </ref> described in section 2 and so the existence of an NEP is guaranteed. Also, Kuhn-Tucker conditions constitute the necessary and sufficient conditions for a feasible system configuration to be an NEP. <p> This is guaranteed by the result in <ref> [18] </ref> that was described in section 2. <p> Again, since each user attempts to minimize its own cost, the problem is modeled as a noncooperative game. The existence of an NEP for the stage game is guaranteed by the result due to Rosen <ref> [18] </ref> which was described in section 2. However, the uniqueness of the system flow configuration that achieves minimum total system cost hasn't been proven yet.
