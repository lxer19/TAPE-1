Abstract: There has been renewed interest in the field of automatic language identification over the past two years. The advent of a public-domain ten-language corpus of telephone speech has made the evaluation of different approaches to automatic language identification feasible. In an effort to provide benchmarks for evaluating machine performance, we conducted perceptual experiments on 1-, 2-, 4- and 6-second excerpts of telephone speech excised from spontaneous speech utterances in this corpus. The subject population consisted of 10 native speakers of English and 2 speakers from each of the remaining 9 languages. Statistical analyses of our results indicate that duration of the excerpt, familiarity with the language, and number of languages known are important factors affecting a subject's performance on the identification task.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION Automatic language identification, the problem of recognizing what language is being spoken, is a challenging research problem with important real-world applications. A recent workshop report identified automatic language identification as one of the key research areas needed for multilingual spoken language systems <ref> [1] </ref>. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) conducted the first evaluation of language identification algorithms in June 1993, with participation from seven different research laboratories. Given the surge of interest in language identification, it is important to study human performance on similar tasks.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we report results of perceptual experiments conducted on 1-, 2-, 4- and 6-second excerpts of telephone speech excised from utterances in ten languages. This research is an extension of our earlier work reported in <ref> [2] </ref>. 2. SPEECH EXCERPTS The speech was taken from the OGI Multi-language Telephone Speech Corpus [2, 3], which has been designated as the standard for evaluating language identification al gorithms by NIST. <p> This research is an extension of our earlier work reported in [2]. 2. SPEECH EXCERPTS The speech was taken from the OGI Multi-language Telephone Speech Corpus <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, which has been designated as the standard for evaluating language identification al gorithms by NIST. The corpus contains fixed vocabulary and spontaneous speech utterances from 90 different speakers each of English, Farsi, French, German, Japanese, Ko-rean, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Tamil and Vietnamese collected over commercial telephone lines. <p> Since Korean had only 76 speakers satisfying this criterion, the excerpts were excised from 76 stories in each language. 3. EXPERIMENT I In <ref> [2] </ref>, we reported results of a preliminary perceptual experiment using the excerpts of speech described above. This experiment is briefly described below for the sake of completeness. 3.1. Design Seven female and four male mono-lingual native English speakers participated in the experiment.
