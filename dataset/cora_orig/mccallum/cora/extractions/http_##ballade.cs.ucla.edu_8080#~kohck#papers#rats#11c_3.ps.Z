Abstract: In this paper, we study the interconnect layout optimization problem under a higher-order RLC model to optimize not just delay, but also waveform for RLC circuits with non-monotone signal response. We propose a unified approach that considers topology optimization, wire-sizing optimization, and waveform optimization simultaneously. Our algorithm considers a large class of routing topologies, ranging from shortest-path Steiner trees to bounded-radius Steiner trees and Steiner routings. We construct a set of required-arrival-time Steiner trees or RATS-trees, providing a smooth trade-off among signal delay, waveform, and routing area. Using a new incremental moment computation algorithm, we interleave topology construction with moment computation to facilitate accurate delay calculation and evaluation of waveform quality. Experimental results show that our algorithm is able to construct a set of topologies providing a smooth trade-off among signal delay, signal settling time, voltage overshoot, and routing cost.

Reference-contexts: Recent studies show that interconnect delay can be reduced by interconnect topology optimization, wiresizing optimization, and/or buffer optimization. A comprehensive survey of these optimization techniques can be found in <ref> [1] </ref>. In this paper, we study the interconnect layout optimization problem under a higher-order RLC model. Our objective is to perform topology and wiresizing optimization for performance and signal integrity under a higher-order moment-based interconnect model.

Reference-contexts: Our objective is to perform topology and wiresizing optimization for performance and signal integrity under a higher-order moment-based interconnect model. It has the following advantages: (1) Most of the previous works on interconnect optimization were achieved under RC interconnect models only, including recent studies on topology optimization <ref> [2, 3] </ref>, wiresizing optimization [4, 5, 6, 7], as well as the most recent works that combined topology construction with buffer insertion and/or wiresizing [8, 9, 10]. They did not consider the inductance effect, which may be an important factor in high-speed MCM/PCB designs and high frequency deep sub-micron designs. <p> All of the previous topology construction algorithms are limited to a single class of routing topology. fl This work is partially supportedby DARPA/ETO underContract DAAL01-96-K-3600 and a grant from Intel Corporation under the California MICRO Program. For example, the A-tree algorithm considered shortest-path Steiner trees only <ref> [2] </ref>, and the set of topologies generated by the P-tree algorithm [9] is restricted to a permutation-induced abstract topology pre-determined by a Traveling Salesman heuristic.

Other metrics that involved even higher order moments include the third central moment proposed in <ref> [15] </ref>. With other attributes (such as the signal delay and the wiring length) being the same, we would prefer a RATS-tree with l i 's as close to zero as possible.

Reference-contexts: RATS-trees include several commonly used topologies when we use the pathlength delay formulation with t T (u; v) = d T (u; v). For example, by setting q i = d (s 0 ; s i ) for all sinks, an optimal RATS-tree is an optimal Steiner arborescence <ref> [17] </ref>. If we relax the requirement such that all sinks have the same required arrival time, then an optimal RATS-tree is an optimal bounded-radius Steiner tree [18]. Lastly, an optimal RATS-tree with unbounded q i 's is an optimal Steiner tree [19]. <p> In general, the RATS-Tree algorithm follows a branch-and-bound paradigm, by considering merging and skipping (of merging) of sub-trees at a Steiner merging point as introduced in <ref> [17] </ref>, as well as re-rooting of a subtree, a concept introduced in [26], at Hanan grid points. <p> If the new Steiner merging point is a terminal, then such a merging is called a terminal merging. Otherwise, it is called a Steiner merging. These operations are similar to those in <ref> [17] </ref>. Let P -(m) = fpjm p; T p 2 T g denote the set of tree roots in T that dominates m. Both terminal and Steiner merging connect from m to each node p in P -(m) and eliminate T p from T . <p> We consider only the two shortest Manhattan paths that correspond to the boundary of the smallest bounding box containing m and p. As in the branch-and-bound-based minimum rectilinear Steiner arborescence (MRSA) algorithms in <ref> [17] </ref>, we also consider skipping a Steiner merging. In this case, while K is updated to jmj, we keep T unchanged. Therefore, skipping a Steiner merging operation generates an additional child B&B node in the B&B search tree. <p> For example, with a clever arrangement of the tree roots in T , it is possible to find the new Steiner merging point m and P -(m) in O (n) time and partially avoid generation of non-planar routings during the merging operation (see <ref> [17] </ref> for details.) Due to the re-rooting operation, however, it is possible that we may create many sibling B&B nodes which will generate non-planar rout-ings in subsequent merging operations.

Reference-contexts: The choice of order q depends on the accuracy required but is always much less than the order of the circuit. In practice, q 5 is commonly used. When q is chosen to be two, it is known as the two-pole model <ref> [23, 11, 24] </ref>. From H i (s), one can derive the approximated output voltage v i (t) and solve for the transition delay t x (i) of the output signal at s i to reach x% of V DD (assuming a rising output) for the first time. <p> In this paper, we use the two-pole delay model proposed in <ref> [24] </ref> to approximate the rise/fall delays of a signal as follows: t 90 (i) = &gt; &gt; &lt; 2:36 i + 4m 2 i ) 2 i 3 (m 1 1:66 i ) 2 m 2 3 (m 1 i i 3 (m 1 3:90 i i 3 (m 1 (3)

Reference-contexts: We generalize the algorithm to handle the case where the terminals are at arbitrary locations in Section 3.7. Given a set of terminals, the RATS-Tree algorithm operates on a Hanan grid <ref> [25] </ref> induced by the terminals. All Hanan grid points are ordered according to their distance from the source, with arbitrary tie breaking. Let (x m ; y m ) denote the coordinates of grid point m, and jmj = x m + y m .

Reference-contexts: In general, the RATS-Tree algorithm follows a branch-and-bound paradigm, by considering merging and skipping (of merging) of sub-trees at a Steiner merging point as introduced in [17], as well as re-rooting of a subtree, a concept introduced in <ref> [26] </ref>, at Hanan grid points.

Reference-contexts: First, an optimal RATS-tree may not lie on the Hanan grid. An example of such a RATS-tree can be found in <ref> [27] </ref>. Second, our algorithm may miss the optimal solutions due to the greedy nature of terminal merging. <p> The reader may refer to <ref> [27] </ref> for details.

Reference-contexts: This is analogous to the concept of reduced ordered binary decision diagram (ROBDD) <ref> [28] </ref> that is commonly used in logic synthesis. We illustrate the idea of a reduced tree representation in Figure 2. Consider two topologies T 1 and T 0 2 that correspond to the same interconnect structure with 8 nodes in Figure 2 (a).
