Abstract: We report our findings of an 1=f power spectrum for the total amount of sand in directed and undi-rected Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld models confined on narrow stripes and driven locally. The underlying mechanism for the 1=f noise in these systems is an exponentially long configuration memory giving rise to a very broad distribution of time scales. Both models are solved analytically with the help of an operator algebra to explicitly show the appearance of the long configuration memory.
