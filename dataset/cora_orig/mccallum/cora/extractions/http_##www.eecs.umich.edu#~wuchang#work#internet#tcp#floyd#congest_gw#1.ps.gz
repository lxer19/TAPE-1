Abstract: In this paper we explore the bias in TCP/IP networks against connections with multiple congested gateways. We consider the interaction between the bias against connections with multiple congested gateways, the bias of the TCP window modification algorithm against connections with longer roundtrip times, and the bias of Drop Tail and Random Drop gateways against bursty traffic. Using simulations and a heuristic analysis, we show that in a network with the window modification algorithm in 4.3 tahoe BSD TCP and with Random Drop or Drop Tail gateways, a longer connection with multiple congested gateways can receive unacceptably low throughput. We show that in a network with no bias against connections with longer roundtrip times and with no bias against bursty traffic, a connection with multiple congested gateways can receive an acceptable level of throughput. We discuss the application of several current measures of fairness to networks with multiple congested gateways, and show that different measures of fairness have quite different implications. One view is that each connection should receive the same throughput in bytes/second, regardless of roundtrip times or numbers of congested gateways. Another view is that each connection should receive the same share of the network's scarce congested resources. In general, we believe that the fairness criteria for connections with multiple congested gateways requires further consideration.

Reference-contexts: On the other side, should each connection get the same throughput in pkts/sec? We consider three different fairness measures: min-max fairness [HG86], the fairness index proposed in [JCH84], and the product measure, a variant of network power <ref> [BJ81] </ref>. Consider the throughput rate for each connection. To satisfy the min-max fairness criteria, the smallest throughput rate must be as large as possible. Given this condition, the next-smallest throughput rate must be as large as possible, and so on.

Reference-contexts: However, in simulations in Figure 5 with Drop Tail gateways and the Increase-by-One window increase algorithm, connection 0 transmits only 178 packets in the first 50 seconds. This is poor performance. In current networks, it is not uncommon for connections to transmit several hundred packets <ref> [CDJM91] </ref>. (It might be less common in the current Internet for connections to pass through multiple gateways with persistent congestion.) The fact that the simulations uses connections 1 to n as bulk data transfers with unlimited data is not an essential factor in these results.

Reference-contexts: This paper gives a quantitative analysis of the throughput of connections with multiple congested gateways. We use both simulations and a heuristic analysis to investigate performance. TCP/IP networks have a bias against connections passing through multiple congested gateways <ref> [DKS90] </ref> [M90b], a bias against connections with longer roundtrip times [H89] [Z89], and a bias against bursty traffic. We consider the interaction of these biases. <p> In <ref> [DKS90] </ref> several simulations are run for a network with three congested gateways, with one long connection and three shorter connections. In the simulations with Fair Queueing or with the selective DECbit algorithm, the longer connection receives half of the available throughput at each gateway. <p> Examples of a router-based approach include the selective DECbit scheme [RCJ87] and Fair Queueing gateways <ref> [DKS90] </ref>.

For the network in Figure 1, this min-max fairness criteria is satisfied when all n + 1 connections receive the same throughput rate. As shown in <ref> [DKS90] </ref>, this is achieved for a scenario similar to that in this paper by the use of the Fair Queueing gateway algorithm.

Reference-contexts: In this paper we show that for our scenario, when the simulations with Drop Tail gateways are constructed to remove traffic phase effects <ref> [FJ91a] </ref>, the performance of networks with Drop Tail gateways and with Random Drop gateways are quite comparable. This paper gives a quantitative analysis of the throughput of connections with multiple congested gateways. We use both simulations and a heuristic analysis to investigate performance. <p> TCP/IP networks have a bias against connections passing through multiple congested gateways [DKS90] [M90b], a bias against connections with longer roundtrip times [H89] [Z89], and a bias against bursty traffic. We consider the interaction of these biases. In a previous paper <ref> [FJ91a] </ref> we reported briefly on investigations of the bias against connections with longer roundtrip times, and we discussed modifications to the TCP window-increase algorithm that could correct this bias. In this paper we principally consider the bias against connections passing through multiple congested gateways. <p> The Random Drop and the Drop Tail gateway algorithms are compared. Three topologies are explored, with one, two, and three congested gateways respectively. The longer connection's throughput is better with Random Drop gateways for some topologies, and better with Drop Tail gateways for other topologies. (As <ref> [FJ91a] </ref> explains, we believe that these results should be interpreted keeping traffic phase effects in mind.) Mankin remarks that the longer connection is disproportionately likely to have packets dropped at the gateway, particularly with Drop Tail gateways. <p> As shown in <ref> [FJ91a] </ref>, this algorithm has a bias against connections with longer roundtrip times. In order to eliminate this bias, some of our simulations use the Constant-Rate algorithm instead in the congestion-avoidance phase. <p> Connections with the Increase-by-One and the Constant-Rate window-increase algorithms both start with the slow-start algorithm of doubling the window each roundtrip time until a threshold has been reached [J88]. 2 In this paper we examine networks with Drop Tail, Random Drop, and RED gateways. As shown in <ref> [FJ91a] </ref>, simulations and measurement studies with Drop Tail gateways are vulnerable to traffic phase effects; small changes in network parameters can result in large changes in the performance of the network. <p> In order to avoid these phase effects in networks with Drop Tail gateways, in this paper the simulator adds a small random component to the roundtrip time for each packet in simulations using Drop Tail gateways. (This is discussed in <ref> [FJ91a] </ref>.) Normally, our simulator charges zero seconds for the time required to process packets at the nodes. <p> The bias of Drop Tail and of Random Drop gateways against bursty traf fic and the correction of this bias in RED gateways are described in <ref> [FJ91a] </ref> and [FJ91b]. With Drop Tail or Random Drop gateways, the more bursty the traffic, the more likely it is that the queue will overflow and the Drop Tail or Random Drop gateway will drop a packet. <p> This bias has been described in <ref> [FJ91a] </ref> and in [FJ91b]. Definitions: The burstiness measure. Consider the following measure of burstiness for one roundtrip time of traffic from a connection. Assume that a connection transmit n packets in one roundtrip time of r seconds. <p> Both of these corollaries concur with the results of simulations in <ref> [FJ91a] </ref>. (The simulations with the Increase-by-One algorithm in [FJ91a] have smaller maximum windows, and this results in a somewhat improved performance for the longer connection.)

Reference-contexts: The bias of Drop Tail and of Random Drop gateways against bursty traf fic and the correction of this bias in RED gateways are described in [FJ91a] and <ref> [FJ91b] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: RED gateways maintain an upper bound on the average queue size at the gateway. The use of RED gateways also simplifies the analysis of the behavior of the network. Definitions: RED gateways. With our implementation of RED gateways <ref> [FJ91c] </ref>, the gateway computes the average size for each queue using an exponential weighted moving average. When the average queue size exceeds a certain threshold, indicating incipient congestion, the gateway randomly chooses a packet to drop and increases the threshold. <p> With high congestion range is decreased, decreasing the feedback time to the source node. RED gateways are described in more detail in a paper currently in progress <ref> [FJ91c] </ref>. 2 One advantage of RED gateways is that, unlike Drop Tail and Random Drop gateways, RED gateways do not have a bias against bursty traffic. <p> We are specifically not proposing Constant-Rate window increase algorithms for current networks. We are currently investigating various alternatives to the current TCP Increase-By-One window increase algorithm. We explore RED gateways in more detail in a paper currently in progress <ref> [FJ91c] </ref>. The main result is simply that there is no inherent reason for long connections passing through multiple congested gateways in TCP/IP networks to receive unacceptably low throughput; this low throughput could be corrected by removing the network biases against connections with longer roundtrip times and against bursty traffic.

Reference-contexts: We discuss later in the paper the implications of these results for networks with a more realistic traffic mix. Definitions: Reduce-to-One, Increase-by-One. Some of the simulations in the paper use the Reduce-to-One window decrease algorithm and the Increase-by-One window increase algorithm from 4.3 tahoe BSD TCP <ref> [J88] </ref>. Our simulator does not use the 4.3-tahoe TCP code directly but we believe it is functionally identical. Briefly, there are two phases to the window-adjustment algorithm. In the slow-start phase the window is doubled each roundtrip time until it reaches a certain threshold. <p> For the simulations in this paper, we use a = 4. Connections with the Increase-by-One and the Constant-Rate window-increase algorithms both start with the slow-start algorithm of doubling the window each roundtrip time until a threshold has been reached <ref> [J88] </ref>. 2 In this paper we examine networks with Drop Tail, Random Drop, and RED gateways. As shown in [FJ91a], simulations and measurement studies with Drop Tail gateways are vulnerable to traffic phase effects; small changes in network parameters can result in large changes in the performance of the network.

Reference-contexts: With Selective Acknowledgement sinks, each ACK acknowledges not only the last sequential packet received for that connection, but also acknowledges all other (non-sequential) packets received. Selective Acknowledgements have been tested in a number of experimental Internet protocols, and their use in a proposed extension to TCP is described in <ref> [JB88] </ref>. 2 Some of the simulations in this section use the TCP Increase-by-One window-increase algorithm for the congestion-avoidance phase of the window-increase algorithm. As shown in [FJ91a], this algorithm has a bias against connections with longer roundtrip times.

Reference-contexts: With the Reduce-by-Half window decrease algorithm, when a packet loss is detected by the "fast retransmission" algorithm the connection reduces its window by half. The details of the Reduce-by-Half window decrease algorithm, which is implemented in our simulator as in 4.3 reno BSD TCP, are somewhat complex <ref> [J90] </ref>. For the purposes of this paper, the important feature of the Reduce-by-Half window decrease algorithm is that with the "fast retransmission" algorithm, the source retransmits a packet and reduces the window by half, rather than reducing its window to one packet.

Reference-contexts: For simulations with two-way traffic the difference in throughput is more pronounced. In simulations with two-way traffic the traffic is much more bursty, due to compressed ACK packets at the gateways <ref> [WRM91] </ref> [ZC91]. As a result of this bursty traffic the performance for connection 0 suffers significantly with Drop Tail or with Random Drop gateways. In the simulations with two-way traffic, connection 0's performance is significantly better with RED gateways than it is with Drop Tail or Random Drop gateways.

Reference-contexts: This paper gives a quantitative analysis of the throughput of connections with multiple congested gateways. We use both simulations and a heuristic analysis to investigate performance. TCP/IP networks have a bias against connections passing through multiple congested gateways [DKS90] [M90b], a bias against connections with longer roundtrip times [H89] <ref> [Z89] </ref>, and a bias against bursty traffic. We consider the interaction of these biases. In a previous paper [FJ91a] we reported briefly on investigations of the bias against connections with longer roundtrip times, and we discussed modifications to the TCP window-increase algorithm that could correct this bias. <p> For the simulations using the algorithms in 4.3 tahoe BSD TCP and FIFO Drop Tail gateways, the longer connection receives 29% of the throughput at each gateway. Several researchers have discussed the bias in TCP/IP networks against connections with longer roundtrip times [H89] [M90b] <ref> [Z89] </ref>. [RCJ87] explores prob lems of fairness with the DECbit scheme [RJ90] with connections having different roundtrip times. [RCJ87] outlines two separate approaches for improving fairness in these conditions, a router-based approach and a transport-based approach.
