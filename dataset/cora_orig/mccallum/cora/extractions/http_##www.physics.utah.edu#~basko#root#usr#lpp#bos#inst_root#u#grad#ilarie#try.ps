Abstract: We have carried out energy transfer studies of 5,5'-(2-Dithienyl)-2,2'-bipyridazine Eu +3 (DTBPZ-Eu) complexes. Tuning the excitation to the oligomer absorption band, we have obtained characteristic Eu +3 photoluminescence. Long lived triplet excitons that are photogenerated in the pure oligomer are absent in the complex, indicating their role in the energy transfer.

Reference-contexts: 1. Introduction The sharp 4f -4f transitions of rare earth (RE) ions are important for optical processes, such as lasing, when the RE ions are inserted into a host material, either as doping ions in semiconductors and insulators or in the form of RE complex in organic molecules <ref> [1] </ref>. Energy transfer between 4f levels of the RE ions and the host is a very well known phenomenon and is the basis for the erbium-doped lasers [2]. Such energy transfer between various RE +3 doped semiconductors and insulators, have been reported [3, 4].

In addition to the radiative recombination to the ground state, the populated excited Eu 3+ electronic states, may lead to ESA to higher energy states. Interestingly, band I, which is the dominant feature of the oligomer PIA spectrum, has disappeared completely.

When these processes for energy transfer are dominant, the absolute energetic position of the 4f multiplets with respect to the semiconductor bandgap is irrelevant; only the splitting of 4f highly localized electron states is important.
