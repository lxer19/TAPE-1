Title: Sequential Thresholds: Context Sensitive Default Extensions

Abstract: Default logic encounters some conceptual difficulties in representing common sense reasoning tasks. We argue that we should not try to formulate modular default rules that are presumed to work in all or most circumstances. We need to take into account the importance of the context which is continuously evolving during the reasoning process. Sequential thresholding is a quantitative counterpart of default logic which makes explicit the role context plays in the construction of a non-monotonic extension. We present a semantic characterization of generic non-monotonic reasoning, as well as the instan-tiations pertaining to default logic and sequential thresholding. This provides a link between the two mechanisms as well as a way to integrate the two that can be beneficial to both.

Reference-contexts: Another way to handle the problem is to appeal to some external source of information not communicated in the default rules, such as using inheritance or priority hierarchies to prefer more specific or higher priority default rules <ref> [ Touretzky, 1984; Horty et al., 1987 ] </ref> , and the utilization of probability theory for determining acceptable default rules [ Pearl, 1989; Neufeld et al., 1990; Bacchus et al., 1993 ] . <p> We evaluate each default rule with respect to a contextual element which is encoded in some way external to the rule itself. An example of this approach is the use of inheritance and priority hierarchies <ref> [ Touretzky, 1984; Horty et al., 1987 ] </ref> to determine the more specific or higher priority extension (s). For example, from the inheritance hierarchy we know that penguins are a subclass of birds, and the more specific rule concerning penguins is given priority over the more general rule concerning birds.

Reference-contexts: The two probability distributions are distinct as they are conditioned on distinct sets of events. Therefore such probability mechanisms are not non-monotonic. An exception to this monotonic probabilistic trend is Kyburg's probabilistic acceptance <ref> [ Kyburg, 1961 ] </ref> , which advocates accepting the conclusions fully when their probabilities are deemed high enough. The work described in this paper is along the same lines. <p> Below we show a quantitative counterpart of default logic that retains its non-monotonic characteristic. 4 SEQUENTIAL THRESHOLDING Now we present a probabilistic reasoning mechanism that is non-monotonic and very close in flavor to default logic. Sequential thresholding can be classified as a kind of probabilistic acceptance <ref> [ Kyburg, 1961 ] </ref> . We accept a statement as true when its associated probability is high, say, above a certain threshold.

Reference-contexts: Section 6 discusses how the two mechanisms can benefit from each other, and Section 7 concludes the discussion. 2 NON-MONOTONIC DEFAULTS, MONOTONIC PROBABILITIES As pointed out in <ref> [ Kyburg, 1996 ] </ref> , there is a distinction between uncertain inferences and uncertain conclusions. In the former, the inference mechanism is uncertain, but the conclusions thus obtained are regarded as perfectly certain.

Reference-contexts: Reiter first argued [ Reiter, 1980 ] that normal defaults are expressive enough for most common sense applications.

The facts and default rules may interact in unexpected ways, and result in no extension or unwanted multiple extensions. We argue that this problem is to be expected in the default logic framework.

Reference-contexts: We may need to retract such conclusions in the face of new information, hence the non-monotonicity. Default logic and many other logical formalisms such as autoepis-temic logic <ref> [ Moore, 1985 ] </ref> and circumscription [ Mc-Carthy, 1980 ] fall into this category. On the other hand, most of the probabilistic community falls into the latter category.

Reference-contexts: This seems to defeat the purpose of doing non-monotonic reasoning in the first place: we can as well explicitly list all exceptions, and revert to deductive inferences instead, which is not desirable even if feasible. "Naming defaults" <ref> [ Poole, 1987 ] </ref> also has a similar problem. 3.2 MISSING CONTEXT We argue that this "intuition problem" arises because we are misled into thinking that we can formulate default rules that are modular.

Reference-contexts: 1 INTRODUCTION Non-monotonic reasoning models the intuitive process of making non-deductive inferences in the face of certain supportive but not conclusive evidence. Default logic <ref> [ Reiter, 1980 ] </ref> is one of the most well known formalisms of non-monotonic reasoning. Although default logic has many attractive features, it also encounters some conceptual difficulties in representing common sense reasoning tasks. <p> We focus on default logic as a concrete example of non-monotonic reasoning formalisms, and discuss how a link between default logic and probability can be beneficial to both. Below let us briefly summarize the preliminary terminology of default logic. 3 DEFAULT LOGIC <ref> [ Reiter, 1980 ] </ref> Let L be a standard propositional language, and P be the finite set of propositional constants in L. We denote the provability operator by `, and for any S L, we have Th (S) = f : S ` g. <p> Reiter first argued <ref> [ Reiter, 1980 ] </ref> that normal defaults are expressive enough for most common sense applications. However, on closer inspection, default rules that appear intuitively reasonable in isolation can give rise to unintuitive results when taken together [ Reiter and Criscuolo, 1981; Lukaszewicz, 1985; Poole, 1989 ] .

Reference-contexts: Non-normal default theories require some additional consideration, but the results basically hold for the general case as well [ Teng, 1997 ] . Normal default theories have essentially the same structure as sequential thresholding. This can best be shown semantically by looking at the possible world partition sequences <ref> [ Teng, 1996 ] </ref> of the generic non-monotonic reasoning mechanism described above, and of its instantiations for these two specific formalisms. 5.1 GENERIC NON-MONOTONIC PARTITION SEQUENCES A possible world is characterized by a truth assignment to all propositions in the language, and a real number weight. <p> This difficulty alone provides a good incentive for seeking out formalisms that either do not make use of numeric information, or if they do, are not sensitive to perturbations in the numbers assigned. Sequential thresholding by itself is very sensitive to the value of the threshold parameter * <ref> [ Teng, 1996 ] </ref> , and thus it makes more sense to use it as a companion mechanism for ranking default extensions rather than using it as a standalone reasoning mechanism.

Reference-contexts: Both default logic and sequential thresholding conform to this characterization. For simplicity, in the case of default logic, we give the instantiation for normal default theories only. Non-normal default theories require some additional consideration, but the results basically hold for the general case as well <ref> [ Teng, 1997 ] </ref> . Normal default theories have essentially the same structure as sequential thresholding. <p> On the contrary, the applicability condition cond of a rule depends critically on the current context, which is an environment created by the facts and the use of other rules.
