Abstract: Yao [Y79] also introduced an oblivious version of this communication game which we call the simultaneous messages (SM) model. The difference is that in the SM model, Alice and Bob don't communicate with each other. Instead, they simultaneously send a message to a referee, who sees none of the inputs. The referee then announces the function value. Our main result is that the order of magnitude of the randomized SM complexity of any function f is at least the square root of the deterministic SM complexity of f. We found this result independently but subsequently to I. Newman and M. Szegedy [NS] who obtain this lower bound for the "equality" function. Our proof is also of interest for its simplicity; a proof in a similar spirit was also found by J. Bourgain and A. Wigderson. We also show that the quadratic reduction actually does occur for the "equality" function. This, combined with our main result, settles Yao's question [Y79], asking the exact randomized SM complexity of this function. We note that the use of O(log n) public coins reduces the complexity of "equality" to constant.

Reference-contexts: Remark 1.3 In view of amplification by repetition, all positive constants * &lt; 1=2 are equivalent for two-sided error randomized protocols, and all positive constants * &lt; 1 are equivalent for one-sided error randomized protocols. Recently, the randomized SM and one-way communication models for two players were studied in <ref> [KNR] </ref> in connection with the VC dimension and the problem of computing the inner product of two real vectors. 2 We shall briefly discuss the public-coin model at the end of this paper, but our main concern is the private-coin model. <p> Avi Wigderson has also communicated to us that the p n upper bound of Theorem 1.5 was also found previously by A.

Let M (f ) be the communication matrix corresponding to f. Without loss of generality, we assume that M (f ) has no identical rows or columns.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction In 1979, Yao <ref> [Y79] </ref> introduced the following communication game: Let f : X fi Y ! f0; 1g be a boolean function. There are two players, Alice and Bob, who wish to collaboratively compute the value of f on fl Email: laci@cs.uchicago.edu. <p> The cost of a communication protocol is the number of bits written on the board for the worst case input. The communication complexity of f , denoted C (f ); is the minimum cost of a protocol computing f: Yao <ref> [Y79] </ref> also proposed an oblivious version of this model which we call the simultaneous messages (SM) model: Let f : X fi Y ! f0; 1g be a boolean function. <p> In the public-no-fee model, the cost of a randomized SM protocol is simply the length of the longer message sent to the referee. Yao states the following theorem <ref> [Y79, Thm. 5, p. 212] </ref> but omits the proof "because of its complexity:" Theorem 6.2 (Yao) For any f; the two-party (private-coin) randomized communication complexity of f is at least (log log (nrow (M (f))) + log log (ncol (M (f )))); where nrow and ncol are the number of distinct
