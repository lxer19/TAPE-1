Title: Advantages of a Leveled Commitment Contracting Protocol

Abstract: In automated negotiation systems consisting of self-interested agents, contracts have traditionally been binding. Such contracts do not allow agents to efficiently accommodate future events. Game theory has proposed contingency contracts to solve this problem. Among computational agents, contingency contracts are often impractical due to large numbers of interdependent and unanticipated future events to be conditioned on, and because some events are not mutually observable. This paper proposes a leveled commitment contracting protocol that allows self-interested agents to efficiently accommodate future events by having the possibility of unilaterally decommitting from a contract based on local reasoning. A decommit-ment penalty is assigned to both agents in a contract: to be freed from the contract, an agent only pays this penalty to the other party. It is shown through formal analysis of several contracting settings that this leveled commitment feature in a contracting protocol increases Pareto efficiency of deals and can make contracts individually rational when no full commitment contract can. This advantage holds even if the agents decommit manipulatively.

Reference-contexts: Choose a leveled commitment contract where = 52:5, a = 30, and b = 20. By substituting these in Equations 1, 2, and 3, it turns out that both agents' IR constraints are strictly satisfied. The substitutions are straightforward but tedious <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> . 2 In the game of the above proof, both IR constraints are satisfied by a wide range of leveled commitment contracts|and for no full commitment contract. <p> to SEQD games. 2 3.2 Neither pays if both decommit Simultaneous decommitting games where a protocol is used where neither agent has to pay a decommit-ting penalty if both agents decommit (SIMUDNP games, Fig. 3) can be analyzed in the same way as SIMUDBP games, but the decommitting thresholds differ <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> . If a is bounded from below, and b from above, a can be chosen so high that the contractor will surely not decommit, and b so high that the contractee will not. So, full commitment contracts are a subset of leveled commitment ones. <p> There exist SIMUDNP games (defined by f (a) and g ( b)) where no full commitment contract satisfies the IR con straints but a leveled commitment contract does. The proof is like that of Theorem 3.1 except that the formulas for decommitting differ <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> . With the same f (a), g ( b), and as in the proof of Theorem 3.1, the Nash equilibria of the SIMUDNP game are as shown in from the truthful ones. <p> We programmed a model to check which of the SIMUDNP equilibria allow contracts that are IR for both agents. The results are quantitatively different, but qualitatively same as in SIMUDBP games (Fig. 5) <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> . Leveled commitment contracts can also increase the efficiency of a deal even if a full commitment contract were possible (the reverse cannot occur): Theorem 3.4 Pareto efficiency improvement. Theorem 2.2 applies to SIMUDNP games. Proof. <p> This allows the tuning of the penalties not only to specific negotiation situations and environmental uncertainties, but also to specific belief structures of the agents. An extended paper analyzes the impact of agents' biased beliefs on the benefits of contracts, and the distribution of these gains <ref> [ 14 ] </ref> . In the presented instance of the simultaneous de-committing game, the Nash equilibrium decommitting strategies were usually closer to truthful ones when a protocol was used where neither pays if both decommit than when a protocol was used where both pay if both decommit.

For example, in the original Contract Net Protocol <ref> [ 19 ] </ref> , the agent that had contracted out a task could send a termination message to cancel the contract even when the contractee had already partially fulfilled the contract.
