Reference-contexts: The adoption of a conceptual modelling approach to process modelling and reengineering facilitates the connection between business process models and information systems development, using a consistent knowledge-based approach to software engineering (e.g. [Jarke92]). As information systems <ref> [CoopIS94] </ref> as well as human organizations [Rockart91] progress increasingly toward cooperative and distributed, networked configurations, it is becoming ever more important to have models that can help reason how complex, interlinked systems contribute to business and organizational objectives.

Reference-contexts: The models are formally represented in the conceptual modelling language Telos [Mylopoulos91] and their semantics are based on intentional concepts such as goal, belief, ability, and commitment (e.g., <ref> [Cohen90] </ref>). The framework has been presented earlier in the context of information systems requirements engineering [Yu93b], business process reengineering [Yu93a] [Yu94a] [Yu94c], and software processes [Yu94b].

Reference-contexts: The importance of being able to clearly link information technologies and systems to business goals and objectives is highlighted by the recent concept of business reengineering (e.g., [Hammer90] <ref> [Davenport93] </ref>). In response to competitive pressures, customer demands and changing regulatory conditions, many companies are fundamentally rethinking the way they do business. Information systems are expected to contribute towards innovative solutions to specific business problems, and not merely to implement well-known solutions.

Reference-contexts: Higher goals are discovered by asking "why" questions. Once sufficiently high-level goals have been identified, alternatives may be sought by asking "how else" the goals can be accomplished. In the auto insurance example described in <ref> [Hammer93] </ref>, the reengineering team wanted to consider radical solutions, by identifying a high-level goal: that claims be settled. Unencumbered by current business thinking about how this goal should be accomplished, the team arrived at innovative proposals that involve new strategic business relationships with insurance agents and body shops.

Reference-contexts: Formal models that capture and organize knowledge about a business environment can facilitate understanding, and associated tools can support the rapid translation of formally expressed requirements to design specifications and to implemented systems <ref> [Jarke92] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The framework includes a Strategic Dependency model for describing the network of relationships among actors, and a Strategic Rationale model for describing and supporting the reasoning that each actor has about its relationships with other actors. The models are formally represented in the conceptual modelling language Telos <ref> [Mylopoulos91] </ref> and their semantics are based on intentional concepts such as goal, belief, ability, and commitment (e.g., [Cohen90]). The framework has been presented earlier in the context of information systems requirements engineering [Yu93b], business process reengineering [Yu93a] [Yu94a] [Yu94c], and software processes [Yu94b].

Reference-contexts: Contributions to softgoals can be positive or negative, and are judged to be adequate or inadequate. The treatment of softgoals is based on a framework developed by Chung for dealing with non-functional requirements in software engineering <ref> [Mylopoulos92] </ref>. By explicitly representing means-ends relationships, the Strategic Rationale model provides a systematic way for exploring the space of possible new process designs.

Three levels of dependency strengths are distinguished based on the degree of vulnerability <ref> [Yu93a] </ref>. configuration. The car owner depends on the insurance company to reimburse for the repairs from an accident (ClaimsPayout). For this, car owner pays insurance premium in order to have coverage (RepairsBeCovered). The insurance company wants to offer good service to the customer in order to keep the business (CustomerBeHappy).

Information systems that support the claims process have this kind of understanding entrenched as implicit assumptions. These assumptions are seldom made explicit during IS development because existing modelling techniques do not encourage or support the modelling of relationships that involve intentional concepts.

Reference-contexts: Currently there is little formal support for this kind of reasoning. Business process reasoning is usually done informally, and are hard to relate to technical system alternatives. The i fl framework has been developed to help support process modelling and reengineering <ref> [Yu94d] </ref>. Processes are taken to involve social actors who depend on each other for goals to be achieved, tasks to be performed, and resources to be furnished.
