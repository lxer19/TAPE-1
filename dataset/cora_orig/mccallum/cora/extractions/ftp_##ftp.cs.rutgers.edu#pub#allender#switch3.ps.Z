Abstract: We show that all sets that are complete for NP under non-uniform AC 0 reductions are isomorphic under non-uniform AC 0 -computable isomorphisms. Furthermore, these sets remain NP-complete even under non-uniform NC 0 reductions. More generally, we show two theorems that hold for any complexity class C closed under (uniform) NC 1 -computable many-one reductions. Gap: The sets that are complete for C under AC 0 and NC 0 reducibility coincide. Isomorphism: The sets complete for C under AC 0 reductions are all isomorphic under isomorphisms computable and invertible by AC 0 circuits of depth three. Our Gap Theorem does not hold for strongly uniform reductions: we show that there are Dlogtime-uniform AC 0 -complete sets for NC 1 that are not Dlogtime-uniform NC 0 - complete.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The notion of complete sets in complexity classes provides one of the most useful tools currently available for classifying the complexity of computational problems. Since the mid-1970's, one of the most durable conjectures about the nature of complete sets is the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture <ref> [BH77] </ref>, which states that all sets complete for NP (under fl This research was done while visiting the University of Ulm under an Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship. y Supported in part by NSF grant CCR-9509603. polynomial-time many-one reductions) are p-isomorphic; essentially this conjecture states that the complete sets are all merely <p> The shortcoming of [ABI93] to which we refer is this: the complete degree under first-order projections is properly contained in the isomorphism type of the complete sets. In order to improve the result in [ABI93] to obtain a true analog of the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture <ref> [BH77] </ref> it would be necessary to show that the complete degree under first-order reductions coincides exactly with the first-order isomorphism type of the complete sets. <p> Our goal is to construct an isomorphism mapping A onto B. We first construct a depth four isomorphism between A and B, and then improve it to depth three. As in most other work constructing isomor-phisms (see <ref> [BH77] </ref> for example), given an input x, we will need to compute the length of the "ancestor chain" of x, and output f (x) if the length of the chain is even, and output g 1 (x) if the length of the chain is odd. <p> Since SAT is reducible to A 0 via a length-increasing and invertible reduction, it follows from <ref> [BH77] </ref> that SAT is P-isomorphic to A 0 . If in addition A is special, then by Theorem 10 there is a (non-uniform) NC 0 reduction from A 0 to A, and by Theorem 2, there is a (non-uniform) superprojection reducing A 0 to A. <p> The bound follows because there is some constant d such that each output bit depends on at most d input bits. 4 Conclusions In closing, let us summarize our results. Berman and Hartmanis conjectured in <ref> [BH77] </ref> that all sets complete for NP under poly-time many-one reductions are P-isomorphic. Following the lead of [ABI93] we have considered the analogous question, where polynomial-time reductions and isomorphisms are replaced by AC 0 -computable reductions and isomorphisms.

Reference-contexts: All of the sets in F have size at most c, and note that, by the way we have constructed our set O, we have that if i 6= i 0 , then S i 6= S i 0 . Thus by the Sunflower Lemma of [ER60] (see also <ref> [BS90, Lemma 4.1] </ref>), the collection of sets F contains a sunflower of size at least t (bs=(c!)c) (1=c) : (3) (This "Sunflower" is a collection of t sets from F with the property that, for all pairwise distinct sets S 1 ; S 2 ; S 3 ; S 4 in <p> of the desired sunflower; exhaustively trying each such possible core in turn, and then using a greedy algorithm to find a maximal collection of sets containing the core and with pairwise disjoint "petals" will eventually uncover a sunflower of the desired size. (The proof of the Sunflower Lemma given in <ref> [BS90] </ref> shows that this approach will succeed.) Finding the desired setting of the bits in the core and petals is easy. Then sequentially deleting the bits from the petals is straightforward. <p> This has been a folklore theorem since [FSS84, Aj83]. Lemma 7 below is explicitly stated in [Ar95]. The proof can be gleaned by suitable modifications of any of several alternative presentations <ref> [BS90, Fo95, B95] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: An NC 0 function is a projection if its circuit family contains no AND or OR gates. The class of functions in NC 0 was considered previously in <ref> [H-a87] </ref>. The class of projections is clearly a subclass of NC 0 and has been studied by many authors; consult the references in [ABI93].

Reference-contexts: We do want to call attention to two general trends this work has taken, regarding (1) one-way functions, and (2) more restrictive reducibilities. One-way functions (in the worst case sense) are functions that can be computed in polynomial-time, but whose inverse functions are not polynomial-time computable. Beginning with <ref> [JY85] </ref> (see also [KMR95, Se92, KLD86], among others) many authors have noticed that if worst case one-way functions exist, then the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture might not be true. <p> (2) projections are easily invert-ible in AC 0 , whereas NC 0 reductions are not invertible in polynomial time unless P=NP. (Invertibility is relevant here, since the likely existence of non-invertible poly-time reductions is one of the main considerations leading many researchers to conjecture that the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture is false <ref> [JY85] </ref>.) We use our results about NC 0 -reducibility, superprojections, and an inherent gap in the power of reductions to prove a true analog of the Berman-Hartmanis conjecture. (That is, the sets complete under AC 0 reductions are all AC 0 -isomorphic.) Finally, we show that our approach cannot yield the
