Abstract: The article introduces the concept of visual classes as a general framework for object classification. Visual classes group together appearances which are similar with respect to a set of image measurements. As defined here, visual classes are implicit in many object representation schemes (geometric as well as appearance based models). We argue that the identification of visual classes provides a powerful tool for object classification. They provide a first step to classification depending on information provided for recognition, including context dependency and relations in space and time between objects. representation of visual classes. First experimental results are given in order to validate the concept.

Reference-contexts: Hornegger and Niemann <ref> [2] </ref> use parameterized mixtures of multivariate Gaussian distributions including a feature transform. This modeling has been shown to be appropriate for point features but cannot be assumed for more general local characteristics.

Reference-contexts: The most efficient way to reduce the number of free parameters is to choose local characteristics which are invariant with respect to different parameters. Such invariant features are used by many researchers <ref> [3] </ref> and successfully applied in various ways. Unfortunately, the invariant descriptors are very limited to certain types of objects. Another way to reduce the number of free parameters is to use local characteristics which are robust with respect to certain changes.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, the probabilistic object recognition algorithm [8] which is entirely based on multidimensional receptive field histograms is also usable. 4 First Experiments This section describes some experiments showing the utility of the introduced concept of visual classes. Here we employ the Columbia image database which contains 20 objects <ref> [4] </ref>. Each object has been taken from 72 different viewpoints with an interval between each viewpoint of 5 ffi (see figure 1). In a first experiment we observe that a 10-dimensional eigenspace is sufficient for the correct recognition of all test images.

Reference-contexts: Using the mean = P K i=1 i , the covariance matrix is given by: = i=1 This covariance matrix provides a series of eigenvalues i and eigenvectors e i which hold (see for details of calculation <ref> [5] </ref>): i e i = e i (8) Using only the first L eigenvectors we can define a orthonormal basis E = [e 1 e 2 : : : e L ], which defines the L-dimensional eigenspace of the histogram database.

Reference-contexts: We are convinced that many local characteristics can be calculated in a robust manner without being invariant. For light changes and noise we apply local characteristics which are robust (in the sense described here). Therefore the analysis of the robustness of the local characteristics used is important <ref> [6] </ref>. As mentioned above, it is relatively difficult to model partial occlusion in a general way. In [8] we have proposed a probabilistic object recognition approach which recognizes objects from small visible portions. This makes the recognition process robust to partial occlusion. <p> In order to reduce the number of images used in [7, 8] the steerability of the Gaussian derivatives [1] to image plane rotation and scale.

We concluded from experiments that the 2 -statistics gives the most reliable results. In the remainder of this article we want to group similar histograms into visual classes i.e. by clustering.

Here we employ the Columbia image database which contains 20 objects [4]. <p> For each of the images of the database we calculate a three dimensional histogram Dx Dy Lap of the first Gaussian derivative in x- and y-directions and of the Laplace operator. For the calculation of these Gaussian derivatives we use a standard formulation (see <ref> [8] </ref>, the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is = 1:5 and the number of cells per histogram axis is 16). Each database image is therefore represented by a histogram Dx Dy Lap with 16 3 = 4096 cells.

Reference-contexts: We can use local characteristics which are invariant to rotation perpendicular to the image plane (by losing some object information) (see for example <ref> [9] </ref>). But no local characteristics exist which are invariant to an arbitrary 3D rotation. Therefore we have to consider at least two, in general all three components of the rotation.
