Abstract: This paper analytically studies retransmission-based partially reliable transport service. Results show that partially reliable transport service provides increasingly higher throughput and lower delay than reliable transport service as an application's loss tolerance increases and as the underlying network service gets more lossy. Also, to some degree, partially reliable transport service eases the negative effects of ack losses on throughput. Three cost functions associated with the reliability level that a system can support are introduced. These cost functions help demonstrate the penalty when a transport service does not support the ideal reliability level for an application. Results show that the use of reliable transport service when an application only needs a partially reliable transport service can cause considerable throughput drops and delay increases in lossy networks. On the other hand, at high loss rates, unreliable transport service is unable to respect an application's loss tolerance. Thus, in lossy environments, partially reliable transport service is necessary to avoid the extra cost of reliable transport service, and, at the same time, to guarantee the minimal reliability that an application requires.

Reference-contexts: Once a lost packet is detected, the sender decides whether or not to retransmit it based on the loss tol erance of the application. Receiver-based loss detection and recovery: The receiving transport entity detects the lost data through gap-detection and loss-timers <ref> [4] </ref>. Once a lost packet is detected and the recovery decision is made, the receiver requests the retransmission of the lost packet by sending negative acks to the sender.

Reference-contexts: Section 4 summarizes the main results. 2 Analytic Model We present an analytic model for providing partially reliable transport service using sender-based loss detection and recovery. This analytic model is similar to the one presented in <ref> [5] </ref> to study the protocol Partial Order Connection (POC). 3 Its major difference is that, in this model, it is unnecessary for all of the objects that are transmitted to eventually be communicated. In [5], no such partial reliability is considered. <p> This analytic model is similar to the one presented in <ref> [5] </ref> to study the protocol Partial Order Connection (POC). 3 Its major difference is that, in this model, it is unnecessary for all of the objects that are transmitted to eventually be communicated.

Reference-contexts: In this paper, we analytically study partially reliable transport service provided by sender-based loss detection and recovery. Then, we identify the cost of not using the ideal reliability service for an application. 2 This investigation uses a sender-based approach since it provides better performance than a receiver-based approach <ref> [6] </ref>. The analytic study basically serves the following purposes: 1. To show the performance gains of partially reliable transport service over reliable transport service for applications that can tolerate a certain level of loss, and thus, to motivate the use of partially reliable service against reliable service. 2. <p> service occurs only when 1 k 5 for all the practical cases. 5 Expression (1) also shows that allowing few retransmissions (e.g., k = 3) is sufficient to have high delivery guarantees (e.g., greater than 110 3 ) at practical loss levels. 4 The computational details can be found in <ref> [6] </ref>. 5 The same conclusion can be made through other target values.
