Abstract: The problem of stabilization and trajectory tracking of feedback linearizable systems in the presence of input saturation is considered in this paper. The need to perform output tracking for nonlinear systems dictates the choice of feedback linearization in our control design. Explicit characterization of the space of feasible trajectories that can be tracked using bounded inputs is provided.

Reference-contexts: In an aircraft there are inherent actuator constraints and thrust limitations which must be taken into account while planning the reference trajectory. This is an essential element of the automated air traffic management system (ATMS) proposed by NASA <ref> [1] </ref>. The problem of stabilization in the presence of input constraints goes as far back as [2]. In [3], it is shown that linear systems with poles in the right half plane can not be globally stabilized using bounded controls. <p> Increasing the amplitude of the desired sinusoid to A = 4 results in the desired trajectory crossing out of U x (dash-dot lines), as shown in Figure 2. Therefore, this sinusoid is not feasible. The initial condi tion <ref> [1; 2] </ref> T results in the state trajectory of Figure 2. Notice that initially, since the state lies in U x , the actual trajectory converges to the desired one.

This approach cannot be directly applied to the problem of feedback linearization under constraints because it is difficult to show that the state constraints will be satisfied. 3.
