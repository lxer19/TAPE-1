Abstract: reduced with encapsulation and standardization of input and output specific code [10, 13]. This paper proposes a possible standard interface through device drivers. The challenge is to create an interface standard that does not require an inordinate amount of overhead. The device drivers discussed in this paper allow efficient use of the processor with minimal overhead for interfacing to the The SIOMS driver solution was originally developed to address problems of maintenance, portability, concurrent access to sensors and effectors, control mode switches, and encapsulated input and output that existed in our previous workcell controller for a Sawyer motor small parts assembly system [2]. The previous controller was based on a modification of NYMPH [1], a 68020 VME Bus based multiprocessor system. Experience with that system indicated that for many of the tasks in manufacturing high performance, dynamic control is not as important as ease of integration of sensors and actuators to accomplish a task. Also we discovered that applications were not portable since they relied on specific hardware for I/O. We therefore decided to focus on providing the most portable solution at reasonable
