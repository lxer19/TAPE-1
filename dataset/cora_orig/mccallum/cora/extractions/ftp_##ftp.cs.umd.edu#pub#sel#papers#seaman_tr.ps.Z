Title: Organizational Issues in Software Development: An Empirical Study of Communication  
Author: Carolyn B. Seaman, 
Degree: Doctor of Philosophy, 1996 Dissertation directed by: Professor Victor R. Basili  
Affiliation: Department of Computer Science  
Note: Abstract Title of Dissertation:  
Abstract: The subject of this dissertation is an empirical study whose goal is to characterize certain aspects of communication among members of a software development organization. The independent variables in this study are various attributes of organizational structure. The dependent variable is the effort spent on sharing information which is required by the code inspection process in use. The research questions upon which the study is based ask whether or not these attributes of organizational structure have an effect on the amount of communication effort expended. In addition, several other variables have been included, such as code size and complexity, which represent factors other than organizational structure which may have an effect on communication effort. The study uses both quantitative and qualitative methods for data collection and analysis.

Reference-contexts: Organizational theorists have cited communication and information processing as the major factors in why organizations are formed [35], how organizations grow [54], what structural mechanisms are chosen [15], and how organizations can be improved [12, 20]. Communication is seen as particularly important in scientific organizations <ref> [1] </ref> because "information processing is the essence of scientific activity." This is true as well for "technological" organizations, like software development enterprises, and is even more complicated in such organizations because the information to be processed exists mostly within the minds of the organization's members and within the organization's physical products, <p> IT, which allows organizations to improve their information processing capabilities to unprecedented levels, is seen as the central enabler of BPR [12]. Some organization theorists have studied communication in "technological" organizations, which are those engaged in non-routine, technologically innovative work. Allen <ref> [1] </ref> claims that "information processing is the essence of scientific activity." The same is true of technology, he continues, but the information is in a different form, in material products as opposed to literature. <p> In order to further investigate the effect of physical distance between organization members, then, it is necessary also to measure distance in terms of organizational structure, in a way that takes into account such mechanisms. Allen <ref> [1] </ref> also presents empirical evidence to support the importance of physical proximity of communicators. He observed the communication patterns of pairs of engineers and scientists in a laboratory. <p> This is consistent with Krasner's [26] findings about "common internal representations". * H2 Interactions tend to require more effort when the participants work in physically distant locations. Curtis [11] and Allen <ref> [1] </ref> have had similar findings. * H3 Interactions which take place during a meeting (a verbal request and an unprepared reply) tend to require more effort than other interactions, even when normalized by the number of participants. 42 * H4 Interactions which involve some form of communication technology (conference calling and

Reference-contexts: In addition, none of the factors studied by Perry et al. were concerned with organizational structure per se (e.g., management hierarchy, etc.), although they were concerned with the organizational context (e.g. communication media, etc.). Ballman and Votta <ref> [2] </ref> have found, based on simulation, a "threshold" level of 60% for communication effort. Here, communication effort is defined as the percentage of developer time spent in meetings. Their simulation results showed that, at levels above 60%, the delay resulting from difficulty in scheduling meetings rises precipitously.

Reference-contexts: with current issues in the project. 3.4.3 Observations Participant observation, as defined in [56], refers to "research that involves social interaction between the researcher and informants in the milieu of the latter, during which data are systematically and unobtrusively collected." Examples of studies based on participant observation are found in <ref> [3, 42, 47, 55] </ref>. In these examples, observations were conducted in the subjects' workplaces, homes, and therapists' offices. The idea, in all these cases, was to capture firsthand behaviors and interactions that might not be noticed otherwise. <p> In these examples, observations were conducted in the subjects' workplaces, homes, and therapists' offices.

The Barley study <ref> [3] </ref> was purely qualitative, in that the observation data was analyzed using qualitative methods only. In [47] and [55], however, quantitative methods were also used to analyze data from the observations.

Reference-contexts: The most visible attempt to study non-technical factors in software development is the process movement. Several methodologies have been defined for the characterization and incremental improvement of software processes <ref> [4, 41] </ref>. As a necessary component of these approaches, techniques have been developed for modeling software development and maintenance processes [5, 32]. In process work, such issues as timing constraints, documentation, and concurrency have been addressed.

Representation of organizational structure in most process work is limited to the representation of roles <ref> [5, 32] </ref>, with a few notable exceptions. One is the approach presented in [25], which uses the Statemate tool. Statemate models include four perspectives, one of which is the organizational perspective, which identifies the people who participate in the process and the information channels between them.

Reference-contexts: In particular, the field of education research matured to the point in the 70's that it was recognized that purely quantitative research "had not delivered" <ref> [6] </ref>. That is, it did not provide the depth of understanding that was needed to make real improvement in education. I argue that empirical research in software engineering is beginning 19 to come to the same conclusion. <p> I have used Lincoln and Guba's [30] definitions of and methods for both prior ethnography and interviewing. On the other hand, Taylor and Bogdan [56] present a definition of participant observation which is more appropriate for this work. I have consulted Bogdan and Bilken <ref> [6] </ref> and Miles [38] for guidance in qualitative data analysis methods as well as practical advice on data collection. Some of the best examples found of work which combines qualitative and quantitative methods are in Gilgun et al. [17].

Reference-contexts: My work attempts to take a deeper look at communication effort, and to define it a bit more broadly. That is, my definition of communication effort includes interactions other than meetings, but is still restricted to communication that is dictated by the development process. Bradac et al. <ref> [7] </ref> present some results, based on a queuing model, on when and how blocking occurs in software development.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, exploration of these issues requires the study of organizational structure. One of the few studies of organizational structures of real software development organizations is the Briand et al. study of a software maintenance organization <ref> [8] </ref>. In this study, the organizational structure was explicitly modeled (using Yu's Actor-Dependency models [62]) in order to understand the information flows and dependencies among maintainers. The analysis recommended further empirical study of all the organizational issues raised.

Reference-contexts: Role Interaction Networks (RINs) [45] (implemented in the modeling tool Deva [36]) also describe process participants and the information that passes between them. The use of CRC cards in the Pasteur tool <ref> [9] </ref> completely describes a process in terms of the process participants and their work dependencies. The main deficiency of these approaches, for my purposes, is that none of them represents the non-process relationships that can affect the information flow between people, e.g. managerial or proximity relationships.

Reference-contexts: I argue that empirical research in software engineering is beginning 19 to come to the same conclusion. In this work, a number of additional sources have been consulted in designing the research method. They include Hinkle et al. [21] on statistical methods and Chambers et al. <ref> [10] </ref> on graphical data display techniques. As well, I have consulted various sources for guidance on qualitative methods. I have used Lincoln and Guba's [30] definitions of and methods for both prior ethnography and interviewing.

Reference-contexts: However, the state of the art is such that not all of these factors have been identified, much less understood well enough to be controlled, predicted, or manipulated. One factor that has been identified <ref> [11] </ref> but is still not well understood is information flow. It is clear that information flow impacts productivity (because developers spend time communicating) as well as quality (because developers need information from each other in order to carry out their tasks effectively). <p> In software development, communication and coordination breakdowns have been found to be one of the most common classes of problems in terms of the additional effort or errors. Curtis et al. <ref> [11] </ref> and Krasner et al. [26] raise a number of communication issues in their qualitative study of the design of large software systems. In fact, as noted by Potts [43], this study raised a number of issues that deserve further study, but they have not as yet received attention. <p> The large variance 5 observed in individual productivity and performance also is evidence of the need for more than technical advances. The Curtis et al. study <ref> [11] </ref> also concentrated on non-technical factors. This work resulted in a layered behavioral model which included not only the management structure of a software organization, but also the network of other types of relationships. <p> I have taken these two main themes from 14 the Perry et al. studies, and formulated a general research question: how does organizational structure (one of the cited non-technical factors) affect how much time developers spend communicating? Curtis et al. <ref> [11] </ref> refer to a number of early studies which "demonstrated the substantial impact" of human and organizational factors on software productivity. Their own field study was based on interviews with personnel from 17 large development efforts. <p> The dissertation study specifically addresses the relationship between these factors. Kraut and Streeter also addressed this relationship, but chose as their variables very different characteristics of organizational structure and communication. 2.2.2 Variables In the previous section, I described how the Curtis et al. study <ref> [11] </ref> suggests at least two of my three independent variables, organizational distance and physical distance, by describing how distance can inhibit effective communication. The same field study is also described in [26]. <p> This relationship has not been explored in detail in software development organizations. However, several studies have provided evidence of the relevance of both organizational structure (as a non-technical factor) and communication in software development. In particular, at least one study <ref> [11, 26] </ref> points specifically to the three aspects of organizational structure which I address in my research questions. Second, my chosen dependent and independent variables have appeared in some form in the literature. <p> This is consistent with Krasner's [26] findings about "common internal representations". * H2 Interactions tend to require more effort when the participants work in physically distant locations. Curtis <ref> [11] </ref> and Allen [1] have had similar findings. * H3 Interactions which take place during a meeting (a verbal request and an unprepared reply) tend to require more effort than other interactions, even when normalized by the number of participants. 42 * H4 Interactions which involve some form of communication technology <p> This contrasts with Curtis <ref> [11] </ref>, who hypothesized that the relationship between organizational distance and communication ease is more straightforward. * H8 Preparing, distributing, and reading material tends to take more effort when all participants are organizationally distant, and when the material is highly structured and large. * H9 Writing and distributing comments to authors during

Reference-contexts: Organizational theorists have cited communication and information processing as the major factors in why organizations are formed [35], how organizations grow [54], what structural mechanisms are chosen [15], and how organizations can be improved <ref> [12, 20] </ref>. <p> For example, organizations sometimes reduce the need for information processing by creating self-contained tasks, or increase their information-processing capacity by the creation of lateral relations (liaison roles, cross-divisional teams, etc.). There is a more recent, related, body of work, usually referred to as "Business Process Reengineering" (BPR) (e.g. <ref> [12, 20] </ref>). BPR advocates radical change as a way of affecting significant improvement in cost and quality of output of an organization. Much of the BPR literature implicitly puts communication at the center of improvement efforts by emphasizing the role of information technology (IT). <p> Much of the BPR literature implicitly puts communication at the center of improvement efforts by emphasizing the role of information technology (IT). IT, which allows organizations to improve their information processing capabilities to unprecedented levels, is seen as the central enabler of BPR <ref> [12] </ref>. Some organization theorists have studied communication in "technological" organizations, which are those engaged in non-routine, technologically innovative work. <p> It was difficult to extract any ideas about possible variables from the BPR literature. In this body of literature, measurement is generally seen as part of 12 the improvement process <ref> [12] </ref>. However, it is not used as a means of identifying areas for improvement. Instead, it is used to determine a baseline, with which it can be determined, after the reengineering exercise, whether or not improvement has been achieved.

Reference-contexts: I have elected not to take this factor into account in this work, in part because I feel it is outside of my scope, and also because it is less relevant than other issues in studying information flow in software development. Ebadi and Utterback <ref> [13] </ref> showed that the most "successful" organizations (in terms of technological innovation) are those in which cohesiveness, frequency, diversity and centrality of communication are high, and the formality of communication is low. Here, the dependent variable is "success", and the independent variables are attributes of communication.

Reference-contexts: Rose et al. also present a useful categorization of data along two dimensions: * subjective vs. objective * qualitative vs. quantitative These two dimensions yield four different classes of data. The dissertation study deals with data in all four classes. A similar research method is described by Eisenhardt <ref> [14] </ref> as an approach to building theory. The dissertation study can be viewed as a theory-building exercise. The subject of study is one in which little previous work has been done, and about which there are no well-formulated hypotheses to be tested. <p> At that time, we began an analysis similar to the "constant comparison method" described by Glaser and Strauss [18] and further suggested by Eisenhardt in <ref> [14] </ref>. The goal of this initial analysis was to suggest possible relationships between variables and other characteristics of inspections. These suggested relationships would then be further explored quantitatively where appropriate. Our comparison method progressed as follows. The field notes corresponding to the first two inspections observed were reviewed.

Reference-contexts: Organizational theorists have cited communication and information processing as the major factors in why organizations are formed [35], how organizations grow [54], what structural mechanisms are chosen <ref> [15] </ref>, and how organizations can be improved [12, 20]. <p> His thesis is that organizations will grow towards or incorporate sources of "news", so that relevant information can be gained as early as possible. The purpose of organizational structure is often articulated as the reduction of uncertainty. Galbraith <ref> [15] </ref> defines organizational uncertainty as a function of the difference between the information needed to complete a task and the information currently possessed by the organization. There are a number of structural mechanisms by which organizations manage uncertainty and lack of information. <p> Mintzberg [39] presents some conclusions on, among other things, the higher success rates of groups whose members are physically located close together. He also discusses the use of organizational liaison devices (building on Galbraith's work <ref> [15] </ref>) in order to facilitate communication between disparate groups in an organization. This implies that the disadvantages of physical distance are sometimes mitigated by organizational structure mechanisms, like liaison devices. <p> I have attempted to do this in the way that I model software development organizations, using Actor-Dependency models (see section 3.3). I have also used Galbraith's information processing theory <ref> [15] </ref> to help specify a modeling strategy to be used in the dissertation study. The information processing mechanisms that Galbraith has identified (self-contained tasks, lateral relations, etc.) must be represented in models of the organizations under study. The modeling strategy I have designed adequately represents all of these mechanisms.

Reference-contexts: This latter type of communication is what can be more easily controlled and manipulated by proper project planning, and is the subject of the dissertation study. An interesting empirical case study, conducted by Gasston and Rout <ref> [16] </ref>, presented a model for assessing the "effectiveness" of software development processes. This study, like the dissertation work, specifically attempted to combine organizational and process issues in their analysis. The authors argue, as I do, that process concerns are inseparable from organizational issues.

Reference-contexts: All three of these are measures of the organizational structure, defined as the network of relationships between members of the software development organization. 1 The study combines quantitative and qualitative research methods. Qualitative methods are designed to make sense of data represented as words and pictures, not numbers <ref> [17] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: The Wilcoxon test produces a p-value which indicates the significance of the difference in means between two sets of data (e.g. organizationally close and organizationally distant). 3.6 Validity Concerns In any empirical study, there are three major types of validity that must be of concern <ref> [24] </ref>. The first is internal validity, which addresses the validity of the conclusions drawn by the study concerning its variables. The second is construct validity, which is concerned with how well the variables and measures employed in the study represent the concepts of interest. <p> Only relationships, usually correlations, are reported, as per the original goals of the study. No hypotheses are asserted which imply causality. Nevertheless, some of the threats to internal validity identified in most texts on research design <ref> [24] </ref> are useful to consider here because they could still affect 58 the validity of the correlational results of this study. In discussing these threats, it is important to remember that the unit of analysis in this study is not the individual, but the code inspection itself.

In particular, a software development study <ref> [26] </ref> has discovered the importance of "shared internal representations", which have led to my particular definitions of Familiarity. Third, the literature in all four areas has helped shape the design of the dissertation study by providing methods and experience. <p> Some of the hypotheses presented below are supported by the discussion in previous sections, while others are discussed in [51, 52]. * H1 Interactions tend to require more effort when the participants are not previously familiar with each others' work. This is consistent with Krasner's <ref> [26] </ref> findings about "common internal representations". * H2 Interactions tend to require more effort when the participants work in physically distant locations.

Reference-contexts: This observation is further explored in the dissertation study by asking the question of how much effort (organizationally and physically) distant participants expend communicating, as compared with close participants. A survey study by Kraut and Streeter <ref> [27] </ref> addressed the same general research question as the dissertation study, i.e. how do structure and communication interact? These authors examined the interaction between structural characteristics and coordination techniques, as well as their effect on project success.

Reference-contexts: Most empirical studies are based on direct (participant) observation of communication in software development processes, as the dissertation study is. Perry et al. is one example. Some observation studies <ref> [28] </ref> have concentrated more on content of communication, rather than form or medium. Wolf and Rosenblum [61] used a combination of observation and automated data collection to measure the lengths of periods of communication in development processes. Walz et al. [59] provide a study based on observations of design meetings. <p> I have also been guided by a number of examples of various methods in the literature, including several doctoral dissertations [49, 50, 53] and several participant observation studies of software development <ref> [19, 28, 42, 59, 61] </ref>. The contributions of these various sources are described in detail later when the research methods are described, in section 3. The combination of quantitative and qualitative data is also used for triangulation, as described in [23].

Reference-contexts: The most visible attempt to study non-technical factors in software development is the process movement. Several methodologies have been defined for the characterization and incremental improvement of software processes [4, 41]. As a necessary component of these approaches, techniques have been developed for modeling software development and maintenance processes <ref> [5, 32] </ref>. In process work, such issues as timing constraints, documentation, and concurrency have been addressed. Other process issues, such as information flow, division of work, and coordination, have not received as much attention. <p> My research design requires such a strategy in order to model the relevant entities in the subject organizations and processes, and to organize the data (see section 3.3). Representation of organizational structure in most process work is limited to the representation of roles <ref> [5, 32] </ref>, with a few notable exceptions. One is the approach presented in [25], which uses the Statemate tool. Statemate models include four perspectives, one of which is the organizational perspective, which identifies the people who participate in the process and the information channels between them.

Reference-contexts: Then I will explain why I have chosen to use empirical methods to explore this issue. 1.3.1 Why Communication? The importance of efficient communication in organizations is well supported in the literature. Organizational theorists have cited communication and information processing as the major factors in why organizations are formed <ref> [35] </ref>, how organizations grow [54], what structural mechanisms are chosen [15], and how organizations can be improved [12, 20]. <p> This more focused study should also attempt to determine factors which can be used to manipulate how communication affects productivity. 4 1.3.2 Why Organizational Structure? Classical organization theory <ref> [35] </ref> tells us that organizational structure aids in the performance of an organization's tasks by, among other things, efficiently channeling information to decision-makers. As cited in the previous section, organizational design is largely directed towards facilitating information flow. <p> In addition, this literature has provided guidance in resolving some study design issues. 8 9 2.1.1 Research Questions There are viewpoints in the organization theory literature which consider communication the central issue in organization design. March and Simon <ref> [35] </ref>, in one of the principal works in organization theory, cite efficient information flow as one of the primary reasons for the existence of organizations. Stinchcombe [54] has studied the effect of information sources on the way that organizations grow over time.

Role Interaction Networks (RINs) [45] (implemented in the modeling tool Deva <ref> [36] </ref>) also describe process participants and the information that passes between them.

Reference-contexts: As well, a few other attempts to study similar issues in software development have provided examples of variables and measures. Finally, several aspects of my research design are motivated by the past experiences of empirical software engineers. 2.2.1 Research Questions In much of their work (e.g., <ref> [37] </ref>), Scacchi and his associates have focused on the importance of "articulation work", defined as the constant negotiation and coordination between members of a development project. Articulation work, being both social and non-technical in nature, is often ignored by software engineering researchers.

Reference-contexts: Few attempts have been made to quantify or describe these factors, or the effort associated with communication. One of these few is the Perry et al. study <ref> [42] </ref>, which has specifically examined how developers spend their time. The authors found that much of it is spent in non-technical activities, including communication. This motivates the need for more focused study of specific kinds of communication, especially communication which can be planned for and controlled (i.e. process communication). <p> The work described in this dissertation uses Actor-Dependency models in a similar way, but extends the analysis beyond qualitative observation. Some of the more general studies of real software developers have also pointed to the importance of "non-technical" factors, in particular organizational structure. The Perry et al. studies <ref> [42] </ref> have stressed the importance of such factors in the success of development projects. As evidence, the authors presented results showing that much of a project's effort is not devoted to purely technical activities like programming and testing. <p> Several of these strategies (e.g. "Focus on the coordination of development work and workers") combine the organizational configuration of workers with their need to effectively communicate. Perry et al. <ref> [42] </ref> conducted two studies with the goal of learning how developers spend their time. One of their more general results was that more than half of a programmer's time was spent in non-coding activities. Most of these were some form of communication activities. <p> Studying these approaches has shaped my research design by providing contrast, and by presenting issues and decisions that I have needed to resolve for this work. In one of the Perry et al. <ref> [42] </ref> experiments, the data was used to determine how developers' time was divided among various technical and non-technical activities. Part of the analysis of this data had to do with how developers communicated. <p> Based in part on this literature, I have chosen the boundaries of the study, the unit of analysis, the use of direct observation, the level of abstraction, and the modeling strategy. 17 Much of the communication recorded and analyzed by Perry et al. <ref> [42] </ref> was informal, unplanned communication. Their results, then, do not reflect on the (usually planned) communication that is required by the development process in place. <p> I have also been guided by a number of examples of various methods in the literature, including several doctoral dissertations [49, 50, 53] and several participant observation studies of software development <ref> [19, 28, 42, 59, 61] </ref>. The contributions of these various sources are described in detail later when the research methods are described, in section 3. The combination of quantitative and qualitative data is also used for triangulation, as described in [23]. <p> with current issues in the project. 3.4.3 Observations Participant observation, as defined in [56], refers to "research that involves social interaction between the researcher and informants in the milieu of the latter, during which data are systematically and unobtrusively collected." Examples of studies based on participant observation are found in <ref> [3, 42, 47, 55] </ref>. In these examples, observations were conducted in the subjects' workplaces, homes, and therapists' offices. The idea, in all these cases, was to capture firsthand behaviors and interactions that might not be noticed otherwise. <p> The Barley study [3] was purely qualitative, in that the observation data was analyzed using qualitative methods only. In [47] and [55], however, quantitative methods were also used to analyze data from the observations. The Perry et al. study <ref> [42] </ref>, which is one of very few observation-based studies 48 of communication between software developers, was designed as an experiment in which many variables were controlled. The experimental design was based on quantitative experimental models, but the observation data was analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Reference-contexts: Curtis et al. [11] and Krasner et al. [26] raise a number of communication issues in their qualitative study of the design of large software systems. In fact, as noted by Potts <ref> [43] </ref>, this study raised a number of issues that deserve further study, but they have not as yet received attention. Factors such as the organizational and physical distance between communicators, and the degree to which communicators share internal understandings of the subject, were observed as key determinants in efficient communication. <p> Such factors are not really outside the realm of the technical, but at the "intersection of the techical and the human" <ref> [43] </ref>. The most visible attempt to study non-technical factors in software development is the process movement. Several methodologies have been defined for the characterization and incremental improvement of software processes [4, 41].

Examples of studies based on interviews can be found in <ref> [44, 49, 50] </ref>. The interviewing method in this study was closest to that presented by Schneider [50], in that the interview questions were designed to elicit information that was missing from previous data collection efforts. In this case, we were conducting interviews to augment observation data.

I have also been guided by a number of examples of various methods in the literature, including several doctoral dissertations <ref> [49, 50, 53] </ref> and several participant observation studies of software development [19, 28, 42, 59, 61]. The contributions of these various sources are described in detail later when the research methods are described, in section 3. <p> Two common practices, both of which have been adopted for this study, are: * Qualitative methods are used to collect data which is then quantified, or coded, into variables which are then analyzed using quantitative methods <ref> [47, 49, 50] </ref>. * Both qualitative and quantitative methods are used to collect and analyze data.

Examples of studies based on interviews can be found in <ref> [44, 49, 50] </ref>. The interviewing method in this study was closest to that presented by Schneider [50], in that the interview questions were designed to elicit information that was missing from previous data collection efforts. In this case, we were conducting interviews to augment observation data.

Reference-contexts: Consequently, a pilot study was conducted in order to refine the research design, to practice using the research methods, and to gain some preliminary results. This section describes this pilot study in detail. An even fuller treatment can be found in <ref> [51, 52] </ref>. The pilot study aims to identify the organizational characteristics which affect process communication effort, and to determine the degree of effect. The dependent variable is communication effort, defined as the total effort expended to share some type of information. <p> A detailed description of this model is found in an appendix, and in <ref> [51] </ref>. 3.2.1.3 Data Collection The data for this study were collected during an initial visit to IBM in Toronto in June 1994, two follow-up visits in November 1994 and April 1995, and several email communications in between the visits. <p> Also, for both the data set as a whole and for the high-effort interactions, I studied the distributions of all variables. 3.2.2 Results The results of the pilot study are presented in this section. A slightly more extensive presentation can be found in <ref> [51] </ref>. I begin by giving an overall characterization of the data collected by looking at each variable in isolation. Then I present some "global" findings, which hold in the data set as a whole, then some findings concerning a subset of high-effort interactions. <p> The results of this analysis are presented in <ref> [51] </ref>. Surprisingly, the results of the test were not significant for many of the data subsets. Thus we can conclude that, in general, interactions which have high XOD and low MOD will require more communication effort. <p> However, even as untested hypotheses, these findings provide important preliminary insight into issues of organizational structure and communication in software development. Some of the hypotheses presented below are supported by the discussion in previous sections, while others are discussed in <ref> [51, 52] </ref>. * H1 Interactions tend to require more effort when the participants are not previously familiar with each others' work. This is consistent with Krasner's [26] findings about "common internal representations". * H2 Interactions tend to require more effort when the participants work in physically distant locations.

His thesis is that organizations will grow towards or incorporate sources of "news", so that relevant information can be gained as early as possible.

Reference-contexts: with current issues in the project. 3.4.3 Observations Participant observation, as defined in [56], refers to "research that involves social interaction between the researcher and informants in the milieu of the latter, during which data are systematically and unobtrusively collected." Examples of studies based on participant observation are found in <ref> [3, 42, 47, 55] </ref>. In these examples, observations were conducted in the subjects' workplaces, homes, and therapists' offices. The idea, in all these cases, was to capture firsthand behaviors and interactions that might not be noticed otherwise. <p> The idea, in all these cases, was to capture firsthand behaviors and interactions that might not be noticed otherwise. The Barley study [3] was purely qualitative, in that the observation data was analyzed using qualitative methods only. In [47] and <ref> [55] </ref>, however, quantitative methods were also used to analyze data from the observations. The Perry et al. study [42], which is one of very few observation-based studies 48 of communication between software developers, was designed as an experiment in which many variables were controlled.

I have used Lincoln and Guba's [30] definitions of and methods for both prior ethnography and interviewing. On the other hand, Taylor and Bogdan <ref> [56] </ref> present a definition of participant observation which is more appropriate for this work. I have consulted Bogdan and Bilken [6] and Miles [38] for guidance in qualitative data analysis methods as well as practical advice on data collection. <p> The qualitative data is then used to help interpret and explain results gained from the quantitative analysis [44, 50, 53]. The data collection procedures chosen for this study come from the qualitative research literature. These procedures are prior ethnography [30], participant observation <ref> [56] </ref>, and structured interviews [30]. Development documents from the environment under study also provide some of the data [30]. As described later, the data gathered from these different sources overlaps, thus providing a way of triangulating [30], or cross-checking the accuracy of the data. <p> The data collection procedures included gathering of official documents, participant observation <ref> [56] </ref>, and structured interviews [30]. Documents The official documents of an organization are valuable sources of information because they are relatively available, stable, rich, and non-reactive, at least in comparison to human data sources [30]. <p> The AD model is implemented in Telos, a knowledge base language. 3.4 Data Collection The data for this study was collected during the period from December, 1995, to April, 1996. The data collection procedures included gathering of official documents, participant observation <ref> [56] </ref>, and structured interviews [30]. The observations and interviews were guided by a number of forms, or instruments. <p> Notices of upcoming inspections were posted here, as well as discussions of various technical issues and periodic status reports. This was a great help to the researcher in keeping up with current issues in the project. 3.4.3 Observations Participant observation, as defined in <ref> [56] </ref>, refers to "research that involves social interaction between the researcher and informants in the milieu of the latter, during which data are systematically and unobtrusively collected." Examples of studies based on participant observation are found in [3, 42, 47, 55]. <p> In this case, we were conducting interviews to augment observation data. For Schneider, interview data was used in conjunction with data from questionnaires. After each inspection meeting, we made note of the information missing from the data form for that inspection. We then constructed an interview form, or guide <ref> [56] </ref>, to include that missing information, as well as several questions that were asked of all interviewees. The questions asked also varied somewhat depending on the role that the interviewee played in the inspection. An example of such a form is shown in Figure 3.6.

Reference-contexts: The information processing mechanisms that Galbraith has identified (self-contained tasks, lateral relations, etc.) must be represented in models of the organizations under study. The modeling strategy I have designed adequately represents all of these mechanisms. Tushman <ref> [57] </ref> studies the relationship between various task and organizational characteristics of technological organizations and their communication patterns. In particular, he examines the determinants of an organization's information processing capacity, its information processing requirements, and the "fit" between the two.

Reference-contexts: Walz et al. [59] provide a study based on observations of design meetings. These studies have been able to provide credible results because they are based on observations of developer behavior, not on perceptions, which have been demonstrated to be problematic at this level of detail in this field <ref> [58] </ref>. Studies based on observation are often conducted at a very low level of detail and include a small number of data points. Such was the case with the pilot study, described in section 3.2.

Reference-contexts: These issues, which I have had to resolve to some extent in order to design the study, are discussed in the literature summary in section 2.5. 2.1 Organization Theory Organization theory is an area of investigation that has existed at least since the early part of this century <ref> [60] </ref>, which is a very long time by computer science standards. Literature in organization theory comes from a number of disciplines, including sociology, psychology, and business. Organization theory has contributed to the research questions for this study, as well as suggested some of the variables used.

Reference-contexts: Furthermore, exploration of these issues requires the study of organizational structure. One of the few studies of organizational structures of real software development organizations is the Briand et al. study of a software maintenance organization [8]. In this study, the organizational structure was explicitly modeled (using Yu's Actor-Dependency models <ref> [62] </ref>) in order to understand the information flows and dependencies among maintainers. The analysis recommended further empirical study of all the organizational issues raised. The work described in this dissertation uses Actor-Dependency models in a similar way, but extends the analysis beyond qualitative observation. <p> The main deficiency of these approaches, for my purposes, is that none of them represents the non-process relationships that can affect the information flow between people, e.g. managerial or proximity relationships. Furthermore, these approaches are limited in their usefulness for quantitative analysis of information flow. Yu's Actor-Dependency (A-D) model <ref> [62] </ref> is another modeling notation that shares many of the characteristics of the three described above. In particular, A-D models are based on process participants and the relationships between them, including information flow relationships. These relationships are not constrained, however, to process relationships. <p> Soft-goals are used to capture informal concepts which cannot be expressed as precisely defined conditions, as are goal dependencies. High product quality, user-friendliness, and user satisfaction are common examples of soft-goals because in most environments, they are not precisely defined. The reader is referred to <ref> [62] </ref> for more information on AD models. My model of the study project includes all of the information presented in this section, as well as more detailed background information and the data collected.
