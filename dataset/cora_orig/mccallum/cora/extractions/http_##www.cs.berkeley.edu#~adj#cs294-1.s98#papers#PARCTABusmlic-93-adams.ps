Abstract: The PARCTAB infrared network provides a flexible infrastructure for research into wireless mobile computing. The network consists of a collection of room-sized cells each wired with a base station transceiver. Mobile computers communicate with transceivers through a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol and act as terminals for applications executing on remote hosts. Each mobile computer is represented by a proxy, or agent, accessible to applications at a fixed network address. In the PARCTAB system it is the agent that is responsible for delivering requests to its corresponding mobile computer, and tracking the mobile as it moves from cell to cell.

Reference-contexts: A round trip T-RPC involves Ethernet, serial line, and IR net transmissions, and provides reliable packet delivery to a mobile host. T-RPC addresses two problems: lost packets, caused by collisions and transmission errors; and movement of tabs between cells. The T-RPC is similar to the approach described in <ref> [1] </ref>. A T-RPC request is sent to the tab (actually broadcast from the cell transceiver where the tab was last sighted). If no response appears within a certain delay, then the packet is resent.

Reference-contexts: For better efficiency, the host serial line can be dedicated to a single base station, and the base station operates asynchronously: the base station forwards IR packets to the host as soon as they are received. Gateway processes on each host export a Sun RPC <ref> [2] </ref> interface for access to the base station. The RPC interface allows clients to send a packet unreliably over the infrared medium. When transceivers receive packets from the gateway they broadcast them into the infrared medium.

Reference-contexts: The type byte is always sent at the lower speed. The checksum is computed using an algorithm <ref> [3] </ref> that is suited to the limited arithmetic capabilities of small microprocessors. 4 Network Layer Implementation The functions of the network layer include routing and heterogeneous network operation. In broadcast networks, such as Ethernet, the routing of packets is quite simple.

Reference-contexts: Each tab is represented by an agent which is the only component that must know how to route packets to the tab. The tab agent serves many of the same functions as Mobile Support Routers (MSRs) in the Columbia Mobile IP proposal <ref> [4] </ref>. However, instead of employing MSRs to handle routing for a group of cells, our network assigns agents to handle routing for specific mobile hosts. IR packets are received by one or more transceivers and transferred to the cell's IR gateway. <p> This is particularly important so that the PARCTAB gives an impression the computing power is palm of the user's hand. A competitive design for the PARCTAB network would be to implement Mobile IP <ref> [4] </ref>. This approach conflicts with the goal of designing a small, portable device and a low-cost infrastructure to support it. Mobile IP would require a tab resident implementation of IP, and the transceivers would become IP routers.

Reference-contexts: The communications cells used in this system are very small and are sometimes referred to as nanocells. In other wireless mobile networks, variants of the CSMA/CA protocol, e.g., MACA <ref> [5] </ref>, have been suggested to improve bandwidth utilization in the event of hidden terminals. It is our belief that hidden terminals are not a significant problem between cells in a cellular system where the cells are well isolated. <p> The media access protocol in use could be replaced by other protocols, such as MACA <ref> [5] </ref>, designed for the mobile environment. Many of these questions are not easy to answer by simulation simply because the usage model is not known. The existing PARCTAB system allows us to gain understanding of the usage model and to plan for the future.

Reference-contexts: Finally, we are building a self-powered transceiver, the velcro-station, for use with a wider range of portable machines such as the HP-95 and Apple Powerbook. The infrared communication capabilities of the PARCTAB network are somewhat different from a wire-based Ethernet <ref> [6] </ref>. Quantitatively, our IR network transmits at 19.2kbps, or about 500 times slower than a 10Mbps Ethernet. The infrared network is also more susceptible to environmental noise caused by, among other things, bright sunlight and fluorescent lights.

Reference-contexts: The most important new dimension these devices bring is location and hence context information. Location tells the system where you are and context tells it who you are with. The authors have already had some experience with another device, the active badge <ref> [7] </ref> which provides location information about people who wear it in a suitably wired building. There are many applications that could modify their behavior based on location. Programs can be designed to automatically make decisions governed by context rules that have been specified by a user.
