Abstract: This paper deals with deductive approximate reasoning techniques. Approximate reasoning is concerned with the appropriate processing of vague and uncertain knowledge, given in a rule based manner. The role model for dealing with vague and uncertain knowledge is the human mind. The ability to build abstractions and vague concepts lies at the heart of the immense capabilities of the human brain. Furthermore, approximate reasoning techniques allow us to formalize and process human expert knowledge. In order to realize an approximate reasoning mechanism we are faced with a lot of important design decisions. A very basic decision is concerned with the choice of an appropriate implication relation. In this paper we examine two complementary choices, namely the Mamdani relation and the G odel relation. We present empirical results with single rules, with groups of rules and rule chaining. We show that when complex knowledge is involved G odel implication yields better results than the Mamdani approach.

The G odel relation is used as implication relation, the FATI approach has to be chosen, and several rules on identical universes are aggregated by the minimum operator.
