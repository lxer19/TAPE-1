Abstract: An infinite series of curves is constructed in order to show that all linear codes can be obtained from curves using Goppa's construction. If one imposes conditions on the degree of the divisor used, then we derive criteria for linear codes to be algebraic-geometric. In particular, we investigate the family of q-ary Hamming codes, and prove that only those with redundancy one or two, and the binary [7; 4; 3] code are algebraic-geometric in this sense. For these codes we explicitly give a curve, rational points and a divisor. We prove that this triple is in a certain sense unique in the case of the [7; 4; 3] code.

Reference-contexts: This is a sufficient, but, in general, not a necessary condi-tion, by the way. By the theorem of independence of valuations, see <ref> [2, p.11] </ref>, there are infinitely many rational functions f on X with f (P i ) = 1 for all i. Hence C has infinitely many representations C L (X ; D; G 0 ). Now return to the general case, where G 0 and f are arbitrary.

Reference-contexts: Therefore 2k m + d ? n + d ? 1, since m n 1. This proves the proposition. Remark 13 The q-ary first order Reed-Muller code C of dimension 3 has length q 2 and minimum distance q (q 1), see <ref> [3] </ref>. By Corollary 4 this code is AG. If q 7, then C ? is not AG, by Proposition 8, since 2 (q 2 3) &gt; q 2 + q (q 1) 1 if q 7. <p> The length of the codewords of RM (r; m) is n = 2 m , the dimension of RM (r; m) is 1+ 1 +: : :+ m ! , and the minimum distance of RM (r; m) 22 is 2 mr , see <ref> [3] </ref> and [17]. So d ? (RM (r; m)) = 2 r+1 &gt; 3. If RM (r; m) is AG then, since n 16, n ] 1 = 2 m1 1; by Proposition 11. <p> But by Remark 20 there will never be misunderstandings about the right interpretation. Remark 22 Recall from Section II (Definition 5 and Remark 4) that H (r; q) denotes any q-ary linear code with parameters <ref> [n = (q r 1)=(q 1); n r; 3] </ref> (codes of the same length and dimension, but with minimum distance greater than 3 do not exist). All such codes are isometric. <p> The latter statement is not true if we replace AG by WAG, as we shall see. To do so, let us first try to find a triple (X ; D; G) such that the code C L (X ; D; G) is a binary code with parameters <ref> [7; 4; 3] </ref>, hence is equal to an H (3; 2). First of all, we need a nonsingular, absolutely irreducible projective curve defined over F 2 , having at least seven rational points. <p> This proves the lemma.

Let G = D 1 + (f 0 ), with f 0 a nonzero rational function on X 1 . <p> Hence the &lt; o &gt;-orbit of P 1 has order 7. This proves the lemma.

Proof: A nonzero codeword of weight 2 corresponds to a g 0 2 L (G)nf0g with (g 0 ) G+P a +P b +P c +P d +P e for some distinct a; b; c; d; e. <p> This basis of L (2Q) gives the generator matrix 0 B @ 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 C C of C L (X 1 ; D 1 ; 2Q). This should be a generator matrix of a <ref> [7; 4; 3] </ref> code, and indeed it is. Remark 29 In Proposition 16 we gave a SAG representation of an H (3; 2): C L (X 1 ; D 1 ; 2Q) is an H (3; 2). <p> Proof: Suppose that (X ; D; G) is an AG representation of a binary <ref> [7; 4; 3] </ref> code, D = P 1 + + P 7 and g = 4. The curve X is not hyperelliptic, since it has more than 2q + 2 = 6 F 2 -rational points. <p> By Remark 1, there is a divisor G 0 on X such that G 0 D and C L (X ; D; G 0 ) = C (X ; D; G). So C L (X ; D; G 0 ) is a <ref> [7; 3; 4] </ref> code. <p> This contradicts the fact that C L (X ; D; G 0 ) is a <ref> [7; 3; 4] </ref> code. We proceed with the proof of the proposition. Suppose that there exists an effective divisor E of degree three on X with l (E) &gt; 1. Then E is obviously base point free, see Lemma 11.

Reference-contexts: The following theorem gives an upper bound. 17 Theorem 3 (Clifford) If l (D) &gt; 0 and i (D) &gt; 0, then l (D) 1 2 deg (D) + 1. Proof: See <ref> [11] </ref>. Remark 10 A hyperelliptic curve is an absolutely irreducible, nonsingular curve of genus at least two, which has a morphism of degree two to the projective line. The pull back under this morphism of a point of degree one on the projective line is called a hyperelliptic divisor. <p> If g 2, then we have equality in Clifford's theorem if and only if D is a principal or a canonical divisor or the curve is hyperelliptic and the divisor D is linearly equivalent with a multiple of a hyperelliptic divisor, see <ref> [11, p.343] </ref>. Definition 11 Let N q (g) be the maximal number of rational points on a nonsingular, absolutely irreducible curve, over F q of genus g. <p> Proof: See [1], where the proof is given for curves over the complex numbers. In <ref> [11] </ref> the proof is given in arbitrary characteristic for l = 3. One can easily make a proof for arbitrary l and in any characteristic, by a combination of [1] and [11]. Remark 12 It is easily verified that (m; l) (m 0 ; l), if m m 0 . <p> Proof: See [1], where the proof is given for curves over the complex numbers. In <ref> [11] </ref> the proof is given in arbitrary characteristic for l = 3. One can easily make a proof for arbitrary l and in any characteristic, by a combination of [1] and [11]. Remark 12 It is easily verified that (m; l) (m 0 ; l), if m m 0 . The following proposition is hidden in a remark of Katsman and Tsfasman, see [13]. Proposition 8 Let C be an [n; k] code. <p> If there is a fourth rational point on X , P 4 say, then we could also take G = P 4 (and the same D). Namely, it follows that g &gt; 0, and by Riemann-Roch and Clifford's theorem (see also <ref> [11, p.138,Example 6.10.1] </ref>), l (G) = 1, hence again L (G) = f0; 1g. <p> Lemma 14 The (SAG) representation (X 1 ; D 1 ; 2Q) is minimal. Proof: As noted already at the beginning, after Remark 24, the genus g (X 1 ) = 3 is minimal. The divisor 2Q is base point free, since its degree is 6 2g, see <ref> [11, p.308,Cor.3.2] </ref>. The result follows by Corollary 2. If [(X ; D; G)] is a minimal AG representation class of H (3; 2), then (g; m) = (3; 6) or (4; 6), by Proposition 12 and Table II. <p> Since deg (' E ) = 3, the pull back ' fl E (Q) of Q under ' E is equal to P a +P b +P c , see <ref> [11, p.138,Prop.6.9] </ref>. This implies that E P a +P b +P c , and hence that l (P a +P b +P c ) = l (E) &gt; 1. But this contradicts the previous claim. <p> We have l (K) = 6 + 1 4 + 1 = 4, by Riemann-Roch. Put G := K P 0 . Then deg (G) = 5. Since X 37 is not hyperelliptic, K is very ample, see <ref> [11, p.341,Prop.5.2] </ref>. Hence l (G) = l (K) 1 = 3 and G is base point free. Let X 0 be the reduced image of X under the morphism ' G : X ! P 2 ; see Remark 6.

Reference-contexts: Combining the above we get the desired result. Corollary 9 The binary Golay code and its extension are not AG. Proof: As we know, the minimal distances of the dual codes of the binary Golay code and its extension are greater than 3, see <ref> [17] </ref>. The binary Golay code is a [23,12] code and its extension a [24,12] code, so they are not AG, by Proposition 11. Remark 17 Our results do not yield a similar result concerning the ternary Golay code and its extension. <p> The length of the codewords of RM (r; m) is n = 2 m , the dimension of RM (r; m) is 1+ 1 +: : :+ m ! , and the minimum distance of RM (r; m) 22 is 2 mr , see [3] and <ref> [17] </ref>. So d ? (RM (r; m)) = 2 r+1 &gt; 3. If RM (r; m) is AG then, since n 16, n ] 1 = 2 m1 1; by Proposition 11. <p> For the definition of C, oeC and oeD, see Definition 4 and the proof of Lemma 2. We have C L (X ; oeD; G) = C if and only if oe 2Aut (C). Here Aut (C) is the automorphism group of C, see <ref> [17, p.229] </ref>. We see that the triple (X ; oeD; G 0 ) represents a code that is isometric with C.

Reference-contexts: Definition 11 Let N q (g) be the maximal number of rational points on a nonsingular, absolutely irreducible curve, over F q of genus g. Theorem 4 (Serre's bound) N q (g) q + 1 + g [2 q]: Furthermore, N 2 (g) 0:83g + 5:35; Proof: See <ref> [20] </ref>. Remark 11 Table I gives some exactly determined values of N q (g). See [16, p.34],[19] and [20]. Table I. <p> Theorem 4 (Serre's bound) N q (g) q + 1 + g [2 q]: Furthermore, N 2 (g) 0:83g + 5:35; Proof: See <ref> [20] </ref>.

Let l 1. <p> One of the curves in S is the following one, which we call X 1 , defined by xy (x + y)(x + z) + xz 2 (x + z) + y 2 z (y + z) = 0: (3) This curve was mentioned earlier by Serre <ref> [20] </ref>. We have checked that X 1 is nonsingular. By Bezout's theorem it is also absolutely irreducible. Let L be one of the seven lines defined over F 2 in P 2 . By Bezout's theorem, the degree of the intersection divisor L X 1 is 4.
