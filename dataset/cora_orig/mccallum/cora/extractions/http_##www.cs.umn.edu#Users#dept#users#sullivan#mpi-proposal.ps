Reference-contexts: One potentially useful paradigm is to compare the characteristics of a subject's motor action in response to a stimuli to the subject's reported perceptual experience. In particular, we might look for inconsistencies in response to stimuli which produce perceptual illusions. Goodale et al. <ref> [1] </ref> employed this paradigm in a recent study of the Titchener circle illusion.

Reference-contexts: Introduction There is a growing body of evidence that there are two separate pathways processing visual information in the human brain <ref> [2] </ref>. One of the proposed pathways provides information to the parts of the brain that control motor movements; the other feeds into areas associated with perceptual decisions.
