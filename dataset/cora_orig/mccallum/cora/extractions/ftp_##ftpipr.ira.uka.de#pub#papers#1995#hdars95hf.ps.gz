Abstract: Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is an intuitive method to program a robot. The user, acting as a teacher or programmer, shows how a particular task should be carried out. The demonstration is monitored using an interface device that allows the measurement and recording of both the applied commands as well as the data simultaneously perceived by robot's sensors. This paper identifies the kind of knowledge that the robot can actually acquire from the human user through demonstrations and the requirements that must be met in order to be able to interpret what has been demonstrated. Finally, it presents and experimentally evaluates an approach to integrated acquisition, evaluation, tuning, and execution of elementary skills and task-level programs for robots based on human demonstrations.

Reference-contexts: Searching the action or perception space completely is absolutely infeasible, and still requires an evaluation by a knowledgeable supervisor. 2.2 Demonstration as the Basis of Learn ing Since the robot requires (human) support for solving the learning tasks, Programming by Demonstration (PbD) <ref> (Cypher, 1993) </ref> seems to be a possible way to go. This paradigm relies on demonstrations of the task under consideration that are given by a user. The demonstrations are used as the primary input and therefore as the basis for the learning process.

Reference-contexts: Two basic aspects of the interaction between the robot and the user can be distinguished (Fig. 1, <ref> (Dillmann et al., 1995b) </ref>). Firstly, the user wants to configure and instruct the robot. This requires to translate the user's language into the robot's, i.e., to compile user intentions into actual robot programs.

Reference-contexts: In (Kuniyoshi et al., 1994), sequences of video images were analyzed in order to generate assembly plans. (Andreae, 1984) presented NODDY, a system that generated generalized programs by fusing several demonstrations. Single demonstrations and user intentions are the basis for the robot programs generated by the system described in <ref> (Friedrich and Dillmann, 1995) </ref>. * On the control level, demonstrations can be used as basis for learning both open-loop and closed-loop new elementary skills. The acquisition of open-loop skills is mostly focused on the reconstruction of trajectories from a sequence of demonstrated states (positions) (Delson and West, 1994; Ude, 1993).

Reference-contexts: How can suboptimal demonstrations be handled such that their bad influence on the learning process can be overcome in order to achieve a good performance? Since automatic quality assessment and demonstration preprocessing were already discussed in <ref> (Kaiser et al., 1995b) </ref>, we are going to restrict ourselves now to questions 1 and 2, while the methodology presented in section 3.2 will consider all of the posed questions. 3.1 The teachers performance a crucial factor in the learning process Ideally, the human teacher will demonstrate exactly what is required <p> Fig. 2 shows an example where using the demonstration data displayed on the right will result only in an elementary skill (like the insertion skill shown left) of unsatisfactory performance. Consequently, whatever knowledge is learned from these data has to be refined on-line <ref> (Kaiser et al., 1995b) </ref>. 3.2 A methodology for robust transfer of human knowledge Since one of the main characteristics of knowledge provided via human demonstrations of actions or object prototypes is the varying quality of this knowledge, both example quality assessment and on-line refinement of the initially acquired knowledge become important

Despite the large number of publications representing research in the various domains related to RPD, what is almost never taken into account is the negative influence the human teacher has on the learning system.

Reference-contexts: While these programming skills may exist in industrial environments, they are certainly not available if the use of robots in a personal environment is considered. For opening the expected new, mainly consumer-oriented service robot market <ref> (Schraft, 1994) </ref>, it is therefore essential to develop techniques that allow untrained users to use such a personal service robot both safely and efficiently. context of personal service robots. Two basic aspects of the interaction between the robot and the user can be distinguished (Fig. 1, (Dillmann et al., 1995b)).
