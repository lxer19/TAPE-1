Abstract: Multiresolution analysis provides a useful and efficient tool for representing shape and analyzing features at multiple levels of detail. Although the technique has met with considerable success when applied to univariate functions, images, and more generally to functions defined on IR n , to our knowledge it has not been extended to functions defined on surfaces of arbitrary genus. In this report, we demonstrate that multiresolution analysis can be extended to surfaces of arbitrary genus using techniques from subdivision surfaces. We envision many applications for this work, including automatic level-of-detail control in high-performance graphics rendering, compression of CAD models, and acceleration of global illumination algorithms. We briefly sketch one of these applications, that of automatic level-of-detail control of polyhedral surfaces.

Reference-contexts: In one respect, this is a generalization of the approach taken by Daubechies <ref> [3] </ref>, whose locally supported orthogonal scaling functions are also defined through a recursive subdivision procedure. Although in general the j+1 (x) are not simple dilates of the j (x), we can nonetheless use them to define a sequence of nested spaces.

Reference-contexts: Wavelet compression methods therefore approximate the original function f j (x) by storing only the significant coefficients of the filter bank decomposition. Impressive compression rates have been reported for univariate signals as well as images <ref> [4] </ref>. 2.3 Subdivision curves and surfaces There are a variety of ways to describe subdivision curves and surfaces.

Reference-contexts: This process, known as Chaikin's algorithm <ref> [5] </ref>, is depicted in Figure 2. We can encode the weights used in the averaging step for Chaikin's algorithm by a picture, known as a mask.

Reference-contexts: By chosing the central weight w (n) in the averaging mask to be w (n) := 1 fi (n) where fi (n) := 2 3 + n ) ! 2 1 ; the limit surfaces can be shown to be tangent plane smooth (using methods such as in <ref> [6] </ref>).

Reference-contexts: By storing a multiresolution representation for each of the objects, it should be possible to greatly reduce the number of significant interactions. In a sense, this use of multireso-lution representations can be thought of as a clustering mechanism for use in hierarchical radiosity <ref> [7] </ref>. 2 Our goal in this report is to describe the theory underlying multiresolution analysis for surfaces of arbitrary topological type. Although one application of the theory - level-of-detail control for polyhedral models is briefly described in Section 4, implementation details and further applications will be treated in subsequent papers.

Reference-contexts: The two examples of subdivision surfaces used throughout this paper are piecewise linear surfaces (i.e., triangulated polyhedra) and the subdivision surfaces invented by Loop in his Master's thesis <ref> [8] </ref>. Just as for curves, piecewise linear surfaces result when the averaging step leaves all vertex positions unchanged. Loop's surfaces have the averaging mask shown in Figure 4, where n denotes the valence of the 6 central vertex.

Reference-contexts: In Section 4, we briefly present the results of our theory applied to a complicated polyhedral subdivision surface. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize our results and list several avenues of future work. 2 Background 2.1 Multiresolution analysis The theory of multiresolution analysis was originally developed by Mallat <ref> [9] </ref> to represent functions defined over IR n . In the following brief survey, we deviate somewhat from Mallat's original formulation and use instead a formulation more appropriate for spline wavelets [1].

Reference-contexts: Multiresolution analysis of parametric curves has a number of important applications, including: compression of curves, adaptive data fitting, flexible editing [12], and acceleration of the tiling subproblem in computing surfaces from contours <ref> [10] </ref>. The extension of multiresolution analysis to functions defined on the unit square is relatively straightforward, and has numerous applications. Among these are the compression of images and operations on tensor product surfaces, such as flexible editing and compression.

Reference-contexts: In many applications, however, the function of interest is defined only on a portion of the real line, leading researchers 1 Work done while on sabbatical from Rice University 1 to extend the theory to functions defined on the unit interval <ref> [11] </ref>. Parametric curves Q (t) = (x (t); y (t)); t 2 [0; 1] can then be represented by applying the analysis independently to each of the coordinate functions x (t) and y (t).
