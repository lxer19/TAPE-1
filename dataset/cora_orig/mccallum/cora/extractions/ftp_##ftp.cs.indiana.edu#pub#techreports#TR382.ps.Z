Abstract: Why do children learn nouns such as cup faster than dimensional adjectives such as big? Most explanations of this well-known phenomenon rely on prior knowledge in the child of the noun-adjective distinction or on the logical priority of nouns as the arguments of predicates. In this paper we examine an alternative account, one which seeks to explain the relative ease of nouns over adjectives in terms of the response of the learner to various properties of the semantic categories to be learned and of the word learning task itself. We isolate four such properties: the relative size and the relative compactness of the regions in representational space associated with the categories, the presence or absence of lexical dimensions in the linguistic context of a word (what color is it? vs. what is it?), and the number of words of a particular type to be learned. In a set of five experiments, we trained a simple connectionist categorization device to label input objects, in particular linguistic contexts, as nouns or adjectives. We show that, for the network, the first three of the above properties favor the more rapid learning of nouns, while the fourth favors the more rapid learning of adjectives. Our experiments demonstrate that the advantage for nouns over adjectives does not require prior knowledge of the distinction between nouns and adjectives and suggest that this distinction may instead emerge as the child learns to associate the different properties of noun and adjective categories with the different morphosyntactic contexts which elicit them.

Reference-contexts: While noun meanings usually involve many dimensions, one, such as shape, may predominate over the others (Landau, Smith, & Jones, 1988). And for some adjectives, more than one sensory dimension may be relevant, and the range of relevant properties may be modulated by other properties <ref> (Clark, 1991) </ref>. Figure 1 illustrates the character of this general difference between adjective and noun meanings for a representational space consisting of only three dimensions. For the adjectives only one of the three dimensions is relevant; for the nouns all three are.

Reference-contexts: This difference in representational span and compactness does not depend on or require a categorical distinction between the meanings of nouns and adjectives because it is only a tendency. While noun meanings usually involve many dimensions, one, such as shape, may predominate over the others <ref> (Landau, Smith, & Jones, 1988) </ref>. And for some adjectives, more than one sensory dimension may be relevant, and the range of relevant properties may be modulated by other properties (Clark, 1991).

Reference-contexts: The child may also be guided by morphosyntactic cues marking the distinction between adjectives and nouns, though these cues are minimal in some languages. Although there is some evidence that very young children can use morphosyntactic differences as small as these to differentiate intended meaning <ref> (Macnamara, 1982) </ref>, there is more evidence to suggest that the use of such cues emerges slowly and errorfully (Soja, Carey, & Spelke, 1991; Smith, Jones, & Landau, 1992). Morphosyntax certainly does not provide foolproof cues at the start of learning.

Reference-contexts: One account, proposed in somewhat different forms by Gentner (1978) and Maratsos (1988) <ref> (see also Markman 1989) </ref>, goes as follows: All languages make a distinction between arguments, or objects, conveyed by nouns, and predicates, or relations, conveyed by verbs and adjectives. This distinction must be fundamental to the way people view the world. <p> errors is closer, indicating that this difference is not sensitive to category span or compactness. 5 Discussion Why do children learn nouns faster than adjectives? Most previous accounts explain this phenomenon in terms of knowledge the child brings to the language learning taskassumptions or biases about the meanings of words <ref> (e.g., Markman, 1989) </ref>. In this paper we have shown that the differences in 2 In this figure the results for the first 1000 training patterns are not shown because early in training there is a disproportionate likelihood that a single noun will be the network's response to all inputs.

Reference-contexts: The learning rule, backpropagation in this case, compares the output of the network to the target and adjusts the network's connection weights in such a way that the network will come closer to the target the next time it receives a similar input <ref> (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986) </ref>. The use of supervised learning is theoretically appropriate in the present case because children are explicitly taught words. Parents put objects before children, label them, ask children questions about objects, and correct their errors (Callanan, 1990; Mervis, 1987; Snow, 1977; 5 Wood, 1980).
