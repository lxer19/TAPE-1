Reference-contexts: The factors manipulated in this project were the slight mistuning of performers with respect to each other, slight deviations in onset times and durations of notes, and uncorrelated vibrato <ref> [DJ85, McA89] </ref>. To mistune the accompanyist, simply change the pitch by a small amount. Creating timing deviations requires varying the tempo. In [DJ85], an algorithm using variable delay lines to do this is described. <p> To mistune the accompanyist, simply change the pitch by a small amount. Creating timing deviations requires varying the tempo. In <ref> [DJ85] </ref>, an algorithm using variable delay lines to do this is described. With time maps, which are described below, it is possible to vary the tempo by a large amount while producing small delays. These large changes in tempo have the additional effect of uncor-relating the vibrato. <p> The curved line represents the tempo for the processed sound. The performance time differs from the score time by only a small amount ( on the order of 10 msec ). This produces the small, variable delays needed in the algorithm described in <ref> [DJ85] </ref>. 1.2 Formant Shift Formants are peaks in the spectrum of a sound caused by the physical resonances of an instrument. If the formants of a sound are shifted, it will seem to have been created by a different instrument or singer. <p> When the version processed as described above was mixed with the original, the perceived sound was clearly different from the original alone. The perception was similar to having more than one singer, but there was little or no stream segregation. 5 3.2 Formant Shift According to <ref> [DJ85] </ref>, the formant frequencies of male singers are between 70% and 80% of the formant frequencies for female singers. In order to shift Suzanne Vega's formants to approximate those of a male singer, the program rate was used to increase the sampling rate by 4 3 .

Reference-contexts: The Gestalt concept of common fate dictates that if all the features of the two sounds are synchronized then they will be attributed to a single source <ref> [Eri82] </ref>. For instance, if the same sound is played in the left and right channels of stereo headphones, the experience is of a single source located in the center. If a small delay is used, then the single source is shifted from the center.

Reference-contexts: To reduce the effects of the noise further, a cross-fade is performed between blocks. 2.3 Pitch The program pitch uses an algorithm similar to the one described by Keith Lent in his recent Computer Music Journal article to change the pitch of a sound without modifying the formants <ref> [Len89] </ref>. Conceptually, Lent's algorithm separates the excitation from the formants of a sound. Consider a periodic waveform as the convolution of a periodic impulse train with a filter whose impulse response is one period of the waveform, as illustrated in figure 2.
