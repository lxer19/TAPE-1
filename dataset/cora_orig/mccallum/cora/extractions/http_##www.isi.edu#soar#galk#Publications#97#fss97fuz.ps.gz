Reference-contexts: Motivating Examples We motivate our discussion by a brief presentation of experiments in fuzzy control use for a small scale problem 1 Copyright 1997, American Association for Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

A fuzzy controller based on the SAM additive fuzzy system model (Kosko 1997) was built to provide goal-directed navigation for a mobile robot using sonar range sensors. The controller directly controlled the velocity and heading of the robot based on the sensor readings.

Reference-contexts: We also cannot assume a perfect designer, since no human or machine designer will be able to supply us with all needed rules. Of course, the rule- explosion problem in fuzzy systems is well known, but approaches to alleviating it in the domain of fuzzy control (e.g., hierarchical systems <ref> (Raju and Zhou 1993) </ref>, optimal rules (Kosko 1997)) have so far focused on structuring the system or modifying the rules in such away that the same knowledge is represented in fewer rules. However, an altogether different method is used in AI systems. In general, a planner generates actions online.
