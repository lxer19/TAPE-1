Abstract: We address the problem of primer selection in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments. We prove that the problem of minimizing the number of primers required to amplify a set of DNA sequences is N P-complete, and show that even approximating solutions to this problem to within a constant factor times optimal is intractable. On the practical side, we give a simple branch-and-bound algorithm that solves the primers minimization problem within reasonable time for typical instances. We present an efficient approximation scheme for this problem, and prove that our heuristic always produces solutions no worse than a logarithmic factor times the optimal, this being the best approximation possible within polynomial time. Finally, we analyze a weighted variant, where both the number of primers as well as the sum of their "costs" is optimized simultaneously. We conclude by presenting the empirical performance of our methods on biological data.

Reference-contexts: 1 Introduction The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has revolutionized the practice of molecular biology, making it routine to synthesize millions of copies of a single gene or other portion of a genome (for a recent review, see <ref> [5] </ref>). PCR has been used to synthesize nanogram quantities of a gene from a single sperm (and thus a single DNA molecule) a 10 14 -fold amplification [1].

Reference-contexts: In addressing combinatorial problems, we seek efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) algorithms. Unfortunately, we can show that the OPC problem is N P-complete, which serves as strong evidence of its intractability, and justifies the use of heuristic solutions (as opposed to exact ones) <ref> [6] </ref>.

Reference-contexts: Large families of related genes have become surprisingly common over the past 5 years. Currently one of the larger families contains as many as 1000 related genes that encode proteins called G-protein-coupled receptors <ref> [7] </ref>. There are many other such families that encode a large range of proteins with essential roles; PCR amplification is often the only technically feasible method for characterizing members of such large families of genes. Here the problem is different from the typical primer selection problem. <p> We also implemented the scheme mentioned in Section 6 that simultaneously minimizes both cardinal-ity and weight. We evaluated the performance of these algorithms on biological data consisting of 56 DNA sequences, each 75 nucleotides long, from one of the transmembrane domains (TM3) from 56 G-protein coupled receptors <ref> [7] </ref>. We have also created 30 random permutations of the codons (i.e., 3-base triplet substrings) of each sequence of the data, and tested our method on all of the resulting instances.

Reference-contexts: Our reduction of MSC to OPC is based on establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the subsets in M and the maximal string subgroups over S, using unique substrings to encode subset membership of the various elements of T . The full details of this transformation may be found in <ref> [14] </ref>, and are omitted here for brevity. 4 Exact Branch-and-Bound Algorithm In this section we outline a branch-and-bound exact algorithm for the OPC problem (the next section will outline a provably-good and more efficient heuristic). <p> can show that there does not exist an algorithm that can simultaneously minimize both the weight and cardinality of a cover with provable nontrivial bounds; this is proved by exhibiting an instance of WOPC where any cover will either have the worst possible weight or else the worst possible cardinality <ref> [14] </ref>.
