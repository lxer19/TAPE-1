Abstract: Higher order spectra of a signal contain information about the non Gaussian and non Linear properties of the system that created it. Since the non linearity in musical signal usually originate in the excitation signal while the linear spectral characteristics are attributed to the resonant chambers, we discard the spectral information by looking at the higher order statistical properties of the residual signal, i.e. the estimated input signal obtained by inverse filtering of the sound. In the current paper we show that the skewness and kurtosis values of the residual could be used for characterization of such important sound properties as belonging to families of strings, woodwind and brass instrumental timbres. The skewness parameter is shown to be closely related to the bicoherence function calculated over the original signal and as such it is succinct to an interpretation as statistical test for the signal conforming to a linear non Gaussian model. The above results are compared to the Hinich bispectral tests for Gaussianity and non Linearity of time series and exhibit a similar classification results. Finally, regarding the higher order statistics of a signal as a feature vector, a statistical distance measure for the cumulant space is suggested.

Reference-contexts: Beyond the traditional and instrument builders' reasons for this classification, the categorization into instrumental families has a strong evidence in orchestration practice. Scoring of chords and harmonic (homophonic) writing achieves better 'blend' for instruments of the same family. For combination of timbres S.Adler <ref> [1] </ref> suggests that "When considering doubling notes, try to find instruments that have an acoustic affinity for one another." This very idea of acoustic affinity had been formulated in our work as a problem of representation and statistical distance in hos feature space, with the idea of using cumulants as acoustic

Reference-contexts: Considering the technical application of these results, there are two approaches to creation of a musically meaningful signal with Gaussian or non Gaussian properties which we are currently investigating. In the first approach <ref> [2] </ref> we assume that we can represent our input signal as a sum of sinusoidal components with constant amplitudes. Application of random jitter to these components effectively reduces the correlations between the constituent frequencies and the resultant signal approaches Gaussianity in the sense that its higher order cumulants vanish.

Reference-contexts: In case of a pitched signal (i.e. signal with discrete spectrum), Gaussianity of the input signal is obtained either for inharmonic signals 3 or harmonic sounds with statistically independent partials. The independence is obtained for instances such as presence of random independent modulations at each harmonic <ref> [3] </ref>. In the following analysis we shall address the questions of Gaussianity and linearity based on the higher order statistics of X t without attempting to estimate the kernels or other system parameters.

Reference-contexts: Since we are dealing with zero mean processes, the third order moment is equivalent to the third order cumulant. For the fourth order we subtract 3 from the kurtosis to get the variance normalized cumulant <ref> [7] </ref>. 3 Tests for Gaussianity and Linearity As noted above, if a process is Gaussian, all its polyspectra of order higher then second are zero. Hence, if the process has a non-zero bispectrum this could be due to either: 1. <p> In the sum of sinusoids interpretation this might be understood as a sum of sinusoids with a constant level of correlation between all components. This effect could be achieved by passing a Gaussian signal through a memoryless non linear function <ref> [7] </ref>.

Testing for Gaussianity and Linearity <ref> [8] </ref>, [9] gives qualitatively similar results. One must note that the cumulants space representation can not determine the Gaussianity/Linearity problem since the calculation of the cumulants involves integrating over the bicoherence plane and no information about the constancy of the bicoherence values is directly available.
