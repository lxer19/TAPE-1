Reference-contexts: For some phones, such as /uw/, /uh/, /en/, /oy/, and /aw/ (mostly diphthongs and glides) the classification score was between 85-90%. This makes particular sense in the light of psycho-acoustical studies that suggest diphthongs and glides are most affected by ROS variations <ref> [1] </ref>. The most difficult phones for speed discrimination were, unsurprisingly, the silence phones, closures, stops, and some fricatives. It is evident that features for fast and slow sounds are different. The next question is whether this difference is causing the higher word recognition error rate for fast speakers.

Reference-contexts: 1. INTRODUCTION It has been observed in various NIST evaluations (e.g. WSJ-Nov93 & RM-Sep92) that ASR systems typically have about 2-3 times higher word error rates on very fast speakers <ref> [2, 3] </ref>. This observation naturally inspires the following question: "why do ASR systems perform significantly worse on fast speech?" We have considered two reasons for the higher error rate of faster speakers. <p> In our experiments, we use ICSI's hybrid HMM/MLP speech recognition system. Since similar rate of speech (ROS) effects have been observed for mixture of Gaussian systems <ref> [2, 3, 4] </ref>, it is our hope that the conclusions of our work are useful in those systems as well. 2. ANALYSIS 2.1.

ANALYSIS 2.1. <p> The overall recognition suffered slightly due to increase in slow speaker error. Assuming an ideal ROS detector the overall system performance would improve to 15.0% error (signif. at a p &lt; 0:01). Such a detector could be approximated by approaches discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>, perhaps in combination with local detectors as described earlier in section 2.1. We have also introduced alternate pronunciations into our word models which represent the phone reduction and deletion effects. The results of running with this lexicon and the adapted net were insignificantly worse than the base system. <p> However, the error of the slower sentences was increased. Assuming an ideal ROS detector (an approximation of which is discussed in <ref> [4] </ref>), the overall error of our system on WSJ-93 evaluation set would be 14.9%, which is a significant improvement (at a p &lt; 0:01) over the 16.1% of our baseline system. More importantly, the ROS-tuned system is potentially more robust to fast speakers, for whom the system might fail seriously.
